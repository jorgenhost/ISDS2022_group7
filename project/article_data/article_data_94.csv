Are nearly a quarter of America’s lead pipes in Chicagoland?
","President Joe Biden’s $2.7 trillion infrastructure plan has sparked criticism from Republicans over what kinds of projects should be included under the category of ""infrastructure."" Last week, CNN anchor Poppy Harlow put the question to the Senate’s Democratic Majority Whip Richard Durbin, who responded with an example from his home state of Illinois. ""Well, I can tell you, I do not exclude clean drinking water from the responsibilities of government and not only dealing with public health issues but creating jobs in America,"" Durbin said. ""And we have 23% of all the lead pipe leads in America in the Chicagoland area. You bet I want to clean up this water supply, and I consider that infrastructure."" Infrastructure in the 21st century extends far beyond just roads & bridges. Safe drinking water, reliable broadband, & affordable housing are all infrastructure. If we invest in these things we will transform our economy & position ourselves to compete for the jobs of the future. pic.twitter.com/L04dHG0Smu For decades, the city of Chicago required pipes connecting street water mains to individual properties to be made of the toxic metal. That ended when lead service lines were banned by the federal government in 1986, years after their use began to decline in many other places. Biden’s proposal — dubbed the American Jobs Plan — seeks to eliminate lead pipes by allocating $45 billion to several U.S. Environmental Protection Agency programs. So, we wondered if Chicago and its surrounding area really account for nearly a quarter of the nation’s lead pipes, as Durbin claimed. While Chicago is unique when it comes to its number of known lead service lines, experts told us it’s tough to determine the accuracy of Durbin’s statistic because no national inventory exists. ""The vast majority of cities don't know exactly how many lead service lines exist or where they are located,"" said Maura Allaire, an assistant professor of water economics and environmental policy at the University of California, Irvine. Durbin spokesman Joe LaPaille told us in an email that Durbin ""misspoke on CNN and said ‘Chicago’ instead of Illinois."" ""However, Chicago does make up a large portion of lead service lines in Illinois, and has more lead service lines than any other city,"" LaPaille said. LaPaille said Durbin got his statistic using figures highlighted by the EPA and the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmentalist non-profit group that has pushed for Biden’s administration to expedite the removal of lead service lines. The EPA’s website offers an estimated range for the number of lead service lines in the country: six to 10 million. Meanwhile, a press release from the Natural Resources Defense Council put the range for Illinois between 730,000 and 1.4 million. To get to 23%, Durbin took the high end of the state estimate and divided it by the low end of the national estimate, LaPaille said. The EPA’s estimate of more than six million is based on survey data published in 2016 by the American Water Works Association, the group representing water utility operators. The agency’s high-end estimate of 10 million comes from survey work conducted by the same group in the 1980s, and was adjusted down to 9.3 million in a recent update for federal drinking water regulations. The 730,000 estimate also comes from the water utilities group, according to Jeremy Orr, senior attorney for the NRDC’s clean water initiative. The 1.4 million figure, on the other hand, comes from more recent data reported by water system operators to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. Illinois is one of four states to require operators to report on the material of service lines in their system. To reach 1.4 million for the state, the NRDC included both known lead service lines and lines of unknown material that may be lead. Another category included in the state EPA dataset allows water systems to separately list lines of unknown material that are not lead. The number of lead lines and unknown lines that may be lead in water systems in Cook County, where Chicago is located, and its five surrounding counties is somewhat lower — but not by much: 1 million out of the state’s 1.4 million total are reported in the region. The 23% estimate Durbin reached for the state’s share ""is not unreasonable,"" said Tom Neltner, a chemicals policy director at the Environmental Defense Fund who has analyzed Illinois’ approach to developing its inventory. ""But it is difficult to be sure because the national number is so uncertain,"" Neltner added. Taking the 1.4 million pipes in Illinois that are or may be lead and dividing that by the EPA’s updated upper-range estimate of 9.3 million, for instance, lowers the state’s share to 16% and the Chicago area’s to 11%. Durbin said ""we have 23% of all the lead pipe leads in America in the Chicagoland area."" His office told us he meant to refer to the entire state, rather than just Chicagoland. Most lead pipes in Illinois are found in Chicago and surrounding counties, however, so Durbin isn’t far off. The bigger issue with his claim comes in its comparison to the nation. Unlike Illinois, which requires water systems to report how many pipes are or may be lead, there’s no national inventory to use for comparison. The survey estimates cited by the federal government are broad, and both Illinois’ and Chicago’s estimated share of those totals varies considerably depending on which end of the range is used. We rate Durbin’s claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Lead Stories and USA Today were among fact-checkers that found that hypercapnia — too much carbon dioxide in the blood — is not caused by mask wearing.  Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said that although the article appears to be presenting a hypothesis, many of the effects it claims cite evidence related to N95 masks typically used by healthcare workers.  We’ve reported there are studies that show that medical N95 respirators may result in increased carbon dioxide, which can lead to headaches and fatigue.

"['Michigan', 'Douglas Frank']","
No, Michigan didn't use an algorithm to manipulate 2020 election results
","Antrim County, Michigan, the site of a human error that briefly produced inaccurate unofficial results on election night in November, remains the target of a misinformation effort that aims to sow doubt about the integrity of the 2020 election. A resident’s lawsuit against the county, filed in late November, helped fuel a debunked conspiracy theory that tabulators made by Dominion Voting Systems switched votes on behalf of Joe Biden. Donald Trump seized upon an analysis filed in the suit that was rife with inaccurate information to advance his claims of a stolen election. A hand recount of every ballot cast in Antrim County affirmed the results and Trump’s victory there.  Now, a new filing in the case claims a more far-reaching conspiracy, one in which the state government purportedly deployed a predetermined ""key"" to mathematically ""convert"" records of registered voters into counted votes. The filing cites an analysis by Douglas Frank, who chairs the math and science department at a school in Cincinnati, that claims to have discovered that Michigan and other battleground states each used a unique key. The filing defines the alleged ""key"" as a ""sixth degree polynomial"" that ""unlocks the door and uncovers the ability to manipulate data and results.""  Frank’s analysis was filed as an exhibit in the case, and he explains his findings in a YouTube video that has received over 26,000 views. Frank says his work shows that ""elections are being decided at the state level."" How? ""Ballots are being harvested at the precinct level, regulated at the county level, and determined at the state level,"" he claims. In an interview with MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, who has peddled disinformation about the election, Frank says he found algorithms were used in every state he’s analyzed to regulate voter registrations and ballots and control the election. The filings were submitted by Matthew DePerno, the lawyer for the Antrim County resident, who is accusing the county of mishandling the results on a marijuana-related proposal that was also on the November ballot. They were shared widely by The Gateway Pundit, a conservative website that has published falsehoods about the election and former Michigan state Sen. Patrick Colbeck, who was recently asked by Dominion Voting Systems to retract claims of voter fraud. While the analysis is new, it boils down to a familiar falsehood: that Michigan’s 2020 election was tainted by widespread misconduct and fraud. There is no evidence for that and a comprehensive series of audits validated election processes and affirmed the results. In the filing, DePerno argues based on Frank’s finding that the number of ballots counted from Antrim and other counties tracks so closely with the vote totals predicted by the purported key, that they could not have occurred naturally without manipulation by the state. They claim the correlation proves that an algorithm had access to voting databases to determine the election result.  Neither DePerno nor Frank provides any evidence for their claim of a state-level conspiracy to manipulate local results, other than the statistical correlation between ballots they claim were cast in the election and what the key — whose derivation they don’t explain — predicts. Gerrid Uzarski, elections director for Kent County, one of the counties examined by Frank, called the allegation ""very far-fetched."" And he questioned the analysis used to support the assertion. ""I’m not sure where he got the numbers from,"" Uzarski said. ""I’ve looked for them myself. I have not been able to find the source."" Frank didn’t respond to emailed questions about how the key was generated, but he said he stood by his findings, which he said are based on information ""directly extracted from the databases provided by the state."" PolitiFact Michigan looked at data from the Secretary of State’s website and official county results and found problems with numbers Frank used and the conclusions he drew. For his analysis, Frank said in the video, he compiled voter demographics, registrations and ballots in nine Michigan counties — Antrim, Barry, Charlevoix, Grand Traverse, Kent, Livingston, Macomb, Oakland and Wayne — and predicted the number of ballots cast using his key. In charts for each county, he breaks down the ballots cast by voters’ age. Trump won six of the counties analyzed by Frank. Frank lists the Census Bureau’s July 2019 population estimates as his source for the number of residents in the county. But the numbers listed in the court filing differ slightly from the census estimates. In a phone call, Frank said the numbers differed because he performed an ""interpolation"" of the census data. For each county, Frank provides a breakdown of the voting age population and compares it to the number of registered voters in the county and concludes that the number of registered voters in each county is near or exceeds the size of the voting age population. Ahead of the election, many counties did have more registered voters on their rolls than voting age residents. That can happen if the rolls aren’t updated to reflect people who have moved out of the county or died. But in order to cast a ballot, voters have to show up to their polling location or fill out and sign an application to request an absentee ballot. Election officials verify that the ballots are given to individuals legitimately registered in Michigan. Cases of voter impersonation are exceptionally rare. Frank then looks at what he claims is his database of registered voters from October 2020. His numbers track closely with voter registration numbers listed on the Secretary of State’s website on Oct. 2, 2020. That suggests that his analysis disregards registered voters who were added after that date — which was one month before Election Day — and the ballots they cast. Indeed, Frank acknowledges that his analysis of turnout and ballots cast counts only those who he says were registered by October. He refers to the other ballots as ""unregistered ballots,"" and alleges that these were ""injected"" at the last minute. But voters in Michigan can register to vote right up through and on Election Day, and thousands took advantage of this right in the November 2020 election. Election officials check to make sure that every ballot cast belongs to a registered voter and that every voter only votes once. The exclusion of thousands of ballots cast in the November election could explain why the turnout rates he lists in the court filing are also inconsistent with those reported in each county’s official election results. Uzarski said the type of fraud Frank alleged would be an insurmountable task given Michigan’s highly decentralized election system. In Michigan, 1,520 city and township clerks process voter registrations, verify ballots and oversee the count on Election Day. Results are compiled by 83 county clerks and certified by county boards of canvassers who review ballots, poll books and the results. Only after the Board of State Canvassers certifies the results is the outcome considered final. It would be impossible to cook up thousands of ballots that were invalidly cast, Uzarski said. ""There is not room for any kind of injection of ballots or injection of ghost voters or people who didn’t vote but people are voting for them."" David Becker, founder and executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, called the allegations in the pleading ""fantastical."" In an email to PolitiFact Michigan, Becker explained that such a conspiracy would have had to be carried out by thousands of people and leave behind a mountain of evidence: meddling with the voter file, extra ballots that couldn’t be explained, voters who tried to vote but couldn’t because someone else had cast their ballots and audits confirming tabulators were tampered. ""There is literally zero evidence of any conspiracy, involving thousands of people, in any state,"" including Michigan, Becker wrote. In a YouTube video, Frank claims his analysis of Michigan’s 2020 election results shows that the election outcome was decided at the state-level ahead of time using a mathematical ""key"" to manipulate vote totals. Frank offers no evidence for his claim other than a statistical correlation to this key, whose derivation he doesn’t explain. The figures he cites as the basis of his analysis are different from those in official records. Experts said the vote-manipulation effort Frank theorizes would involve a wide-ranging conspiracy that would not be possible under Michigan’s decentralized election system.

No, the government doesn’t use a ‘national ID’ to track you after receiving COVID-19 vaccine
","A nearly year-old video pushing a conspiracy theory that COVID-19 vaccinations will be used to track your movements utilizing artificial intelligence and a biological ""national ID"" is again circulating on social media. The original video, which is over an hour long, claims without any evidence that COVID-19 — short for ""coronavirus disease 2019"" — actually stands for ""certificate of vaccination ID AI."" The ""AI,"" the video explains, is derived from the fact that ""A’ is the first letter of the alphabet and ""I"" is the ninth. The video was originally posted May 1, 2020, by pastor and YouTube evangelist Robert Breaker.. An edited and condensed version of the video was published on Facebook by an evangelical group on April 9. ""What the elites’ desire and plan is is to inject you with a vaccine — and it’s not just going to be a vaccine for your health, it’s going to inject into you other things,"" Breaker says in the video. ""And it’s going to inject into you some things that are going to change your DNA ... it’s got some sort of small nanotechnology. It’s got some sort of small metal something in it, and what it does ... is they’re planting 5G everywhere."" The April 9 post was flagged as part of efforts by Facebook to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While the video in this post includes a number of conspiracy theories concerning the pandemic, we focused on its central claim — that the government will gain the ability to track you with a ""national ID."" The speaker in the video suggests that the ID is a unique biological signature of sorts contained in the vaccine itself and that some sort of AI system will be able to communicate with this so-called national ID via ""some sort of small nanotechnology.""  Let’s break this down in two parts. First, the federal government has said it will not mandate issuance of a proof-of-vaccination card or, in this case, a ""national ID."" While it’s true there are businesses in the private sector that are considering proof of vaccination, it’s a far cry from a government-imposed national mandate. Second, to further back up his claim, the speaker references a patent — patent number is WO2020060606 — that he says is owned by Microsoft and would allow third-parties to monitor the location and medical information of people who have been vaccinated.  A search of publicly available records shows that Microsoft has filed an application for a patent that is still pending — but no actual patent, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. But the concept pitched in this application, a program used to pay people with cryptocurrency,  has nothing to do with injecting anything into anyones’ bodies.  Finally, ingredients used in the vaccines approved by the FDA for emergency use are publicly listed for Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. Nothing in the lists suggests anything but the ordinary substances of vaccines. Beyond the falsehoods stated about the patent application, Breaker, the video’s speaker, also says that vaccines contained ""nanotechnology"" in the form of ""small metal"" bits. We rated a similar claim Pants on Fire. Lipid nanoparticles make up part of the ingredient list for the mRNA vaccines, but the term ""nanoparticle"" refers only to size. The claim here that Microsoft patented 5G-powered tracking ""nanotechnology"" that were used in the development of any vaccines is also false.There is no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 vaccinations, once injected, create an invisible, trackable ID in the bodies of those inoculated.   We rate this claim Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2021/apr/16/facebook-posts/no-government-doesnt-use-national-id-track-you-aft/

Wisconsin lawmaker overreaches on claim that Republicans delayed COVID testing
","With $3.2 billion from the federal government in play, legislative Republicans took a run at wrestling oversight away from Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. The two Republican-run houses passed a bill that would have given them power over where to spend the money, but this latest of many partisan COVID skirmishes ended when Evers vetoed the bill March 29, 2021, announcing his own spending plan. The shots fired before that veto included a March 28 TV appearance by Senate Minority Leader Janet Bewley, who leveled wide-ranging criticism of Republicans on WKOW-TV’s Capital City Sunday. ""You have to put this in context of how the Republicans typically do things in our state with anything having to do with COVID,"" said Bewley, D-Mason, when asked about the prospect of legislative oversight on the federal funds. ""First they denied that there was really a big issue about it. … And then now that we have resources, they will delay it as much as they possibly can, as they did with testing and everything else."" Indeed, some Wisconsin Republicans have downplayed the threat of COVID-19, and legislative leaders drew widespread criticism after failing to pass any bill for a period of more than 300 days as the pandemic raged. But Bewley included a specific criticism that is more original — that Republicans delayed testing, which has been a critical part of limiting the spread of COVID-19. Did Republicans really slow that process? The reference to delayed testing implies Republicans blocked or stalled some specific measure that caused delays. But Bewley offered no such evidence when asked for backup for her claim. Rather, her staff pointed broadly to the Republican inaction after an initial COVID response bill passed in April 2020. ""By refusing to take any state action, pass any legislation, or allocate any state funds to COVID testing or other pandemic response, the Republicans effectively delayed our ability to make testing more widely available,"" said Leslie Westmont, a spokeswoman for Bewley. ""For example, in November of 2020, Governor Evers proposed a COVID bill that would have allocated $403 million dollars to fund state-wide testing and surge capacity and require insurers to cover COVID-19 testing. The Republicans refused to take up the legislation."" RELATED: Wisconsin Republicans passed one COVID bill before long period of inaction She added that with more resources — as Democrats requested —  ""more testing could have been accomplished."" Indeed, testing capacity was a problem throughout 2020, in Wisconsin and across the world. But officials here haven’t generally cited funding as the issue. The testing process involves obtaining a collection kit, conducting the test and transporting it to a lab. Supplies needed along the way include at minimum a swab, transport liquid, protective gear, lab machinery and reagent — chemicals used to conduct the test at the lab. In April 2020, state officials told PolitiFact Wisconsin the supply chain for each of those elements was short of what it needed to be for expanded testing. In August, Advocate Aurora Health stopped testing due to delays receiving testing supplies. Later that month, officials said testing was insufficient to begin reopening schools due to limited state lab capacity. None of those reports referenced insufficient funding as an obstacle. Bewley also didn’t provide any evidence connecting those dots — a critical point since at PolitiFact the burden of proof is always on the speaker. Alesha Emmert, spokeswoman for Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke, said the bill Republicans passed in April 2020 made allowances for testing. ""The COVID relief bill we approved at the beginning of the pandemic included ensuring no co-pays for COVID-19 testing and setting aside $75 million in state dollars to address future, unexpected needs that federal dollars wouldn’t cover – including things like testing,"" Emmert said in an email. ""Senator Bewley should know that, as she voted for the bill. She’s clearly confusing her talking points in an attempt to make a point that doesn’t exist."" Criticizing Republicans’ attempt to control disbursement of federal COVID funds, Bewley said Republicans had previously delayed COVID-19 testing. The phrasing implies a specific action that led to testing being limited, but that not an accurate summary of the situation. Yes, Republicans took almost no legislative action throughout 2020, and lack of testing was often referenced as a key hurdle in the pandemic. But officials throughout the year said testing shortages were about a lack of available supplies and testing capacity, not a shortage of funding. It’s not impossible to believe additional funding would have improved testing, but without evidence that’s merely a hypothetical. That leaves us with a grain of truth, but not much more. We rate this claim Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2021/apr/16/janet-bewley/wisconsin-lawmaker-overreaches-claim-republicans-d/

The proof that the vaccines work includes a lengthy regulatory process and vaccine trials that happened around the world.  The Food and Drug Administration has authorized for emergency use two-dose vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, as well as a one single-dose vaccine from Johnson & Johnson. The three were approved after clinical trials involving tens of thousands of participants. As of April 15, nearly 126 million Americans had received at least one dose of a vaccine, and over 78 million have been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have accounted for the vast majority of those inoculations. Clinical trials showed the Pfizer vaccine to be 95% effective at preventing COVID-19 infections, compared with 94% for Moderna and 66% for Johnson & Johnson, according to the CDC. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was also found to be 85% protective against severe disease. The clinical trials ""clearly show the efficacy of each vaccine,"" said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California. Some fully vaccinated people can still get infected, since no vaccine is 100% effective. But the clinical studies show the vaccine can keep them from getting seriously ill, the CDC says. ""It is incontrovertible that the vaccines work,"" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""Just look at hospitalization rates."" Further studies have since supported the trial findings. A CDC study published March 29 found that under ""real-world conditions,"" the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were 90% effective against infections two weeks after the second dose and 80% effective 14 days after the first dose. A separate study conducted in Israel and published Feb. 24 in the New England Journal of Medicine found that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine provided nearly 90% protection. ""Israel is a good example of what high population-level vaccination rates can achieve,"" said Brooke Nichols, assistant professor of global health at Boston University. ""Once they achieved high vaccination coverage, cases began to plummet."" Carlson’s claim that ""maybe (the COVID-19 vaccine) doesn’t work"" hinged on the CDC’s latest guidance recommending that fully vaccinated Americans continue taking precautions in public. Carlson said there are no good reasons for that. We found several, though. The guidance reflects the fact that scientists are still learning about the vaccines: how long protection lasts; how much vaccines protect against emerging variants of the virus; and to what extent the vaccines prevent asymptomatic infections and transmission of the virus. The CDC says preliminary evidence indicates that the vaccines ""may provide some protection"" against certain variants, and that ""a growing body of evidence"" suggests fully vaccinated people are less likely to be asymptomatic carriers of the virus and potentially less likely to pass it along to others.  But the science on those questions is not settled, Watanabe said, and fears that newer variants could be more transmissible make additional safeguards important for now. In public spaces, there is no way to tell who is among the roughly 25% of the U.S. population that has been fully vaccinated. Some ""very vulnerable people"" remain at risk, Nichols said.  ""Public health guidance on masks is not going to change until enough people are vaccinated because it is operationally very difficult to be able to tell who was vaccinated and who is not if you are, for example, working in a store,"" Adalja said. Responding to Fauci’s criticism on his show April 14, Carlson claimed he had ""never for a minute doubted"" that the COVID-19 vaccines work, despite expressing that very doubt the night before, and saying there was no other plausible explanation for the CDC’s guidance ""Who is doubting that vaccines work? For the record, we never for a minute doubted it. We bought all of that stuff completely at face value. We believe in science,"" Carlson said, adding that he trusted the pharmaceutical companies behind the vaccines. ""The only reason we are asking the question is because the people in charge are acting like it doesn't work."" A Fox News spokesperson cited those comments and other examples of Carlson claiming to support vaccines, including when he said he’s ""not against it on principle"" during his April 13 segment and when he said March 30, ""I think of myself as pretty pro-vaccine myself.""  But Carlson has also questioned the vaccines and U.S. vaccination efforts before, just as he cast doubt previously on the effectiveness of masks and the threat of the coronavirus.  On Feb. 9, Carlson said the government’s handling of the vaccines ""did not inspire confidence"" and that U.S. authorities were ""lying"" about their safety and effectiveness. On other occasions, he has suggested that the government is using the vaccines as a form of ""social control"" and that the shots would be made mandatory, which is not the case. Many questions about the vaccines that Carlson has claimed authorities have ""discouraged"" Americans from asking have been answered by public health agencies and also by news outlets, including PolitiFact. Carlson said, ""Maybe (the COVID-19 vaccine) doesn't work, and they're simply not telling you that."" That claim is countered by clinical trials and real-world studies that show the available vaccines effectively protect against COVID-19 infections and severe symptoms.  Carlson based his claim largely on the fact that the CDC still recommends that fully vaccinated people wear masks and keep their distance in public spaces. Carlson said he couldn’t think of a reason why the CDC would do that, but we found some pretty simple explanations. Experts said those precautions are advisable because most of the U.S. population remains unprotected and because scientists are still studying to what extent the vaccines stop transmission, among other things.

"['North Carolina', 'Jeff Jackson']","
No, Jeff Jackson hasn't flip-flopped on the filibuster
","A Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate has already changed positions on a key issue, according to a wing of the Republican establishment. Jeff Jackson, a state senator from Charlotte, is one of several Democrats running for the seat that Republican U.S. Sen. Richard Burr will vacate in 2022.  The National Republican Senatorial Committee said in an April 12 press release that one of Jackson’s recent tweets reveals he has changed his view on the filibuster. The filibuster, a loosely-defined term, generally refers to a rule allowing a minority of senators — even just one — to hold up legislation, effectively requiring 60 votes for a motion to end debate. It’s a hot topic because Democrats control the White House and Congress, but their majority is so narrow that a filibuster can effectively block any major legislation they promised on the campaign trail. The group credited Jackson’s alleged change of mind to pressure he received from one of his Democrat challengers, former state Sen. Erica Smith. ""Erica Smith gets Jeff Jackson to flip-flop on the filibuster in under a month,"" the NRSC declared. Consistency is a trait many voters look for in a candidate. So PolitiFact takes the term ""flip-flop"" seriously. In fact, we have our own Flip-O-Meter to help measure how much someone’s position has changed. Most recently, we ruled that Republican Amanda Chase did a Half Flip when she added a caveat to her pledge not to run as an independent in this year’s Virginia governor’s race if she did not win her party’s nomination. In North Carolina, we ruled in October that U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis did a Full Flop when he decided to support a U.S. Supreme Court justice nominee in an election year. PolitiFact has also put multiple claims about the filibuster through the Flip-O-Meter. So, how much has Jackson changed his position on the filibuster?  We asked the NRSC for evidence showing that Jackson once supported the filibuster but now opposes it. Committee spokesman T.W. Arrighi pointed to two instances. On Jan. 26, Jackson appeared on Spectrum News’ ""Capitol Tonight"" show. About six minutes into the segment, anchor Tim Boyum asked Jackson if the filibuster ""should survive."" Jackson said: ""I think the survival of the filibuster is completely dependent on whether or not [Senate Minority Leader] Mitch McConnell chooses to act in a responsible way. If he chooses to treat that in any manner remotely resembling what he did with it the last time he had the opportunity and just bring everything to a halt, it’s gone. I think it's hanging by a thread right now, and I think that's the best case you can make for it."" In other words, Jackson said his support for the filibuster was dependent on McConnell’s actions. On April 8, Jackson posted three consecutive tweets in response to a Washington Post story about the decision by Democratic Sen. Joe Machin of West Virginia to support the filibuster. Jackson tweeted: ""This is an incredibly reckless position from Sen. Manchin, given that Sen. McConnell believes he has no political incentive to work with Dems on major legislation. I guess you can send him a bunch of emails if you want ... or you can just elect me and we’re good here. ""For his position to make sense, Sen. Manchin has to believe there’s a reasonable chance of pulling significant GOP support for major bills. There is absolutely 0 evidence for this. It’s going to be the obstruction playbook again. Now with his help. ""Sen. Manchin isn’t moving us toward compromise. He’s moving us toward gridlock, and voters are fed up with that. We have to be able to deliver on things that matter to people. We can’t just give up here at the start."" Where does Erica Smith come in? The NRSC’s release suggests that Jackson spoke out about the filibuster because Politico in March compared his ""filibuster skeptical"" position to Smith’s belief that it should be abolished. Politico reported that Jackson ""did not outright endorse getting rid of the 60-vote threshold but said it should not be a roadblock to passing legislation on voting rights."" Between January and April, Jackson went from pinning his support of the filibuster on McConnell’s actions to saying that Manchin's support of the filibuster is giving in to Republicans' ""obstruction playbook."" Jackson told us there’s been ""no change"" in his position on the filibuster itself. He says his position remains ""filibuster skeptical."" As for his tweets, Jackson says he’s frustrated by Manchin’s position. He says Manchin is either wrongfully giving the Republican leader the benefit of the doubt, or he’s ""saying in advance that he won't stand up to McConnell if he abuses the filibuster."" In an interview with PolitiFact, Jackson reiterated his doubts about McConnell while also tying his support for the filibuster to the Kentucky senator’s actions. ""An early test will be voting rights legislation. If Sen. McConnell decides to filibuster it, that would be an example of something that should not be allowed to occur,"" Jackson said in a text exchange. ""I am practically certain that he's going to abuse the filibuster to gridlock the Senate. If he does, the filibuster should be reformed."" The NRSC says ""Erica Smith gets Jeff Jackson to flip-flop on the filibuster."" Jackson initially tied his support for the filibuster to McConnell’s actions, saying he wants to see whether the Republican leader will use it to try to block key legislation. And at the time, Jackson noted McConnell’s history of blocking legislation. To date, it’s not clear that Jackson has deviated from that wait-and-see, middle-of-the-road position.  The NRSC sees Jackson’s tweets about Manchin as evidence he wants the filibuster gone. Jackson says that’s not the case. He says he’s frustrated that Manchin has dug in his heels to preserve the filibuster so quickly. At worst, Jackson has grown more fearful that McConnell will use the filibuster. It’s fair for the NRSC to point out that Jackson has become more outspoken, but there’s not enough evidence to definitely say he’s changed his position.

Capito correct that school funding in Biden’s relief bill extends through 2028
","As President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan was on its way to congressional passage, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., criticized the bill for being paradoxical. She said it was framed as immediate relief for the coronavirus pandemic and its associated economic impacts, yet it allocated money years into the future, when the pandemic will presumably be over. During a March 4 press conference, Capito said, ""We know that the bill that’s in front of us … has a lot of money in it for schools, but if you really look at it … it says that the school money is going to go out until the year 2028. This is supposed to be an emergency bill. It is an emergency to get our schools reopened and our students back to school. We need to get the schools open, and we still have money in the pipeline to do that."" Is some of the ""school money"" in the $1.9 trillion bill scheduled to go out as late as 2028? The short answer is yes. Capito’s office pointed us to data from the Congressional Budget Office, Congress’ nonpartisan arbiter of budget figures. As the measure was being considered, CBO released a cost estimate for the section of the bill that falls under the jurisdiction of the House Education and Labor Committee.  The CBO estimate counts almost $129 billion of funding in the bill as falling under the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund. This accounts for the vast bulk of K-12 education spending in the measure. (Higher education funding is also included in the bill, but Capito’s remarks dealt with K-12 schools.) Here’s a year-by-year breakdown of when that roughly $129 billion will be spent:   As the chart shows, some money will be spent on K-12 education every year between 2021 and 2028. It’s worth noting that relatively little money will be spent as far out as 2028: Less than 1% of the total spending is scheduled to occur in 2028 itself, and collectively, the years 2026 through 2028 will account for only 10% of the spending. The bulk of the money, about 60%, is to be spent in the middle three years — 2023, 2024, and 2025. About 30% would be spent in 2021 and 2022. (The 2021 fiscal year, which roughly overlaps with the 2020-2021 school year, is already underway. That helps explain the small amount allotted for 2021.) In other words, only about one-third of the money would be spent relatively quickly, supporting Capito’s point. Relatively little money would be spent as late as 2028, but she is correct that some will be. Capito said that the American Relief Plan ""has a lot of money in it for schools, but if you really look at it … it says that the school money is going to go out until the year 2028. This is supposed to be an emergency bill."" She is correct that spending on K-12 education will continue through 2028, though 90% will be spent between now and 2025.

Fact-checking whether ‘kids in cages’ border facility is at 700% capacity
","After the Trump administration in 2018 began separating children from their parents at the Mexico border and housing the children temporarily in chain-link enclosures, Democrats used ""kids in cages,"" a term the Trump administration rejected, to attack Trump. Now, amid record-breaking numbers of child migrants crossing the border, critics of President Joe Biden are crying foul.  Stated one post circulating on Facebook:  ""Don’t hear y’all complaining about kids in cages now they’re at 700% capacity. Funny. Almost like you don’t care when it’s Biden."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) News organizations including CNN and CBS reported in March that a temporary border processing facility holding migrant children in Donna, Texas, was at 700% or more of capacity. It’s a tent complex, essentially a building with soft walls, where children sleep in see-through plastic pods.  At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the Trump administration implemented a policy that immediately expelled all people crossing the border, including children who arrived alone. The Biden administration stopped that practice for children in January, allowing children who cross the border alone to remain in the U.S. while they await immigration court proceedings.  Experts say that a pull factor created by Biden’s policy change is one of several factors driving the uptick in unaccompanied minors. Another is a federal judge’s order in November that stopped the Trump administration’s practice of returning accompanied children. A widely shared Facebook post claimed: ""Kids in cages"" in border facilities are ""at 700% capacity."" The term ""cage"" is a subjective one that Democrats used to attack the Trump administration’s policy of separating children from their parents and temporarily housing them in facilities with chain-link enclosures. A Texas tent complex that houses migrant children temporarily has been at more than 700% capacity, as record numbers of children cross the Mexico border.

Pete Buttigieg is right: Racism shaped some urban highways
","Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg recently kicked off a social media frenzy when he said that racism has sometimes been a part of highway planning and construction. The remarks came in an interview conducted by the Grio, a news outlet focusing on news of special interest to a Black audience. ""There is racism physically built into some of our highways, and that’s why the jobs plan has specifically committed to reconnect some of the communities that were divided by these dollars,"" Buttigieg said during the interview, which was published on April 6. He was referring to President Joe Biden’s proposal known as the American Jobs Plan, which would provide funding for various types of infrastructure, including roads, highways and bridges. Three days after the interview, Young America’s Foundation, a conservative group, tweeted Buttigieg’s statement with the mocking caption, ""This is not parody."" This is not parody. pic.twitter.com/bzbplAnfqO 
Replies flooded in, accusing the group’s tweet of being ignorant of history. ""Anyone who has ever studied road-building history of *any* major American city knows what Pete B. was talking about,"" tweeted James Fallows, a writer with The Atlantic.  We reached out to experts on highways and urban history and found wide support for Buttigieg’s assertion, although other factors often played a role as well. Buttigieg’s office also provided links to articles on the subject. Even in cases where it’s hard to document whether racist thinking explicitly drove highway construction, the existence of divided and weakened neighborhoods in so many cities has been ""racist in effect,"" said Earl Swift, author of ""The Big Roads: The Untold Story of the Engineers, Visionaries, and Trailblazers Who Created the American Superhighways."" While some examples of racism in U.S. highway planning have been cited from the 1930s and 1940s, the highest-profile allegations have involved the Interstate Highway System, which was established in the mid-1950s and was in its heaviest design and building phase through the mid-1970s.  Most of the system consists of inter-city routes, which generally run through lightly populated areas and have attracted little controversy. However, the routes through cities — which often required the clearing of densely populated neighborhoods — were controversial at the time, and have only become more so in recent years. One fundamental reality of road-building, experts say, is to keep costs down, and the price tag for land acquisition can sometimes exceed the cost of construction. Sometimes the quest for cheaper real estate led through public parks or dilapidated waterfronts. These produced some unpopular examples of vista-scarring blight — some of which were later torn down or scaled back, such as the Embarcadero Freeway in San Francisco. But in other cases, highway planners eyed routes through populated areas — and ""inevitably, this sent interstates barreling through the poorest parts of town,"" Swift said. ""In the years during which the system was being laid out, that usually meant African American neighborhoods."" Often, the motivations for road-building came from political and business leaders in urban centers, who sought to stop the loss of population and businesses from downtown by luring back car-driving suburbanites, said Mark H. Rose, a historian at Florida Atlantic University. ""In hindsight, we correctly understand that a tacit racism was a part of many of the planners’ decisions,"" said Tom Lewis, the author of ""Divided Highways"" and a professor of English at Skidmore College. ""It was rarely, if ever, overt. Planners had little guidance other than to create a safe highway at the least possible cost."" But he added: ""The effects on the underrepresented, especially Blacks and Latinos, were devastating."" Often, extra-wide rights of way were approved so that ""decaying"" homes and apartments in a project’s path could be demolished. ""It seemed a win-win to planners, but it didn't feel that way to the people who found themselves in the juggernaut's path,"" Swift said. There are numerous examples of Interstate highways tearing through existing neighborhoods populated largely by people of color. In Miami, I-95 ran through the predominantly Black neighborhood of Overtown. In Alabama, portions of I-65 or I-85 were routed through Black communities in Montgomery and Birmingham. In Los Angeles, freeway planners targeted Boyle Heights, a neighborhood with many Mexican Americans.  In North Carolina, a freeway decimated the ""Black Wall Street of the South"" in Durham’s Hayti neighborhood. The North Claiborne Avenue area of New Orleans was the home of the Black Mardi Gras, but in the early 1960s, highway planners all but destroyed the neighborhood for an elevated section of I-10. Other examples can be found in Baltimore, Detroit and Richmond, Va., among other cities. Sometimes Interstates were built in ways that kept racial groups apart. ""In Atlanta, the intent to segregate was crystal clear,"" Princeton University historian Kevin M. Kruse has written. ""Interstate 20, the east-west corridor that connects with I-75 and I-85 in Atlanta’s center, was deliberately plotted along a winding route in the late 1950s to serve, in the words of Mayor Bill Hartsfield, as ‘the boundary between the white and Negro communities on the west side of town."" St. Paul, Minn. (Jeremy Noble, Creative Commons) In St. Paul, Minn., I-94 was built through the Rondo neighborhood, which had been settled initially by Jewish residents and then by African Americans moving out of the tenements of downtown St. Paul, said Rebecca Wingo, a historian at the University of Cincinnati who has written about the history of Rondo along with community resident Marvin Anderson. Initially, developers proposed two routes, one along an abandoned railroad and the other along Rondo Avenue, the neighborhood’s main artery. The state chose the path through the Black neighborhood. ""Some residents took the lowball offer on their home and moved away; others fought through the legal system; still others sat on their front porches with shotguns and waited for police,"" Wingo and Anderson wrote. All told, the highway construction displaced over 750 families and 125 businesses. ""But it’s not like Rondo residents were able to go and buy a new home for the price of their payment — their homes were undervalued, and racist housing covenants prevented residents from buying in certain areas,"" Wingo told PolitiFact. Robert Moses salutes following a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Brooklyn, N.Y., to open the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge on Nov. 21, 1964. (Creative Commons) One of the most notorious examples of racism in highway planning predates the Interstate system: the Southern State Parkway on New York’s Long Island, which was built by the powerful planner Robert Moses. In Robert Caro’s critical biography of Moses, ""The Power Broker,"" Caro reveals that Moses ordered his engineers to build the bridges low over the parkway to keep buses from New York City away from Jones Beach, making it less accessible for many poor minorities without cars. Thomas J. Campanella, a professor of architecture, art, and planning at Cornell University, investigated the anecdote and found aesthetic concerns may have played a role — but that unusually low bridges on the parkway give credence to the allegation of racism. ""It’s fair to say that the Southern State Parkway has racism in its DNA,"" Campanella told PolitiFact. Buttigieg referred to the racist legacy in ""some of our highways."" But some racially mixed or predominantly white neighborhoods also found themselves in the path of urban Interstate projects. Steven Malanga, a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, has noted several examples, such as I-70 in Indianapolis, which was routed through the multiracial Southside neighborhood, and Boston’s Central Artery Project, which sliced through the largely Italian American North End (and which was, after many years, rerouted underground).  ""I have no doubt given those times and the breadth of projects that, in some cases, planners targeted low-income Black neighborhoods because they were easier targets,"" Malanga told PolitiFact. ""That was reprehensible, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the system was built on widely racist terms."" Moses’ projects also affected mixed or predominantly white neighborhoods. ""His Gowanus Expressway destroyed New York City’s largest Scandinavian community, in Sunset Park,"" Campanella said. ""The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway blew out the Italian and Puerto-Rican neighborhoods of South Brooklyn and much of working-class Jewish Williamsburg. The Cross-Bronx Expressway destroyed a vibrant Jewish community in the Bronx.""  Moses ""was an equal opportunity offender,"" Campanella said. Moses’ Lower Manhattan Expressway, planned in the 1950s, would have cut a swath through SoHo and Little Italy, said David Goldfield, a historian at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte. But the project was scuttled when residents — who were mostly white and predominantly from nearby Greenwich Village — organized to stop it. Elsewhere, too, residents were able to stop projects from tearing through neighborhoods. A planned highway in Washington, D.C., drew fierce opposition from Black and white residents alike, since it would have run through a combination of wealthier and lower-income neighborhoods. And in Baltimore, an alliance between the city's poor and working class of all races stopped I-70 from entering the city proper. ""The most successful efforts to stop the highways were not those that focused on racial justice or those that were put in place to protect Black communities,"" Deborah Archer, president of the American Civil Liberties Union and a professor at New York University School of Law, told NPR. ""The people who were most successful were the ones that focused on environmental justice and protecting parks and their communities in that way, not because we were concerned about the massive destruction and disproportionate impact that the highway construction had on Black communities."" Buttigieg said, ""There is racism physically built into some of our highways."" In city after city, highways of the Interstate era and before have prompted the demolition or fragmentation of Black neighborhoods — due, historians say, to a combination of racism, lower acquisition costs for real estate, and weaker political muscle to oppose the projects. Mixed neighborhoods and those inhabited by lower-income white Americans were also divided, or at least targeted, by highway planners. We rate the statement True.

Fact-checking Biden’s claim about number of students who speak Spanish
","Former Vice President Joe Biden campaigned with members of central Florida’s Puerto Rican community following polls showing he is underperforming among Hispanics in the battleground state. During a Hispanic Heritage event in Kissimmee, where he kicked off his speech with a clip from the song ""Despacito"" by Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi, Biden released his plan for Puerto Rico, including hurricane recovery measures, relief from debt and investments in public schools. Biden also praised the contributions of Hispanics in America, and cited a statistic about Spanish-speaking children. ""Today, it is no exaggeration to say that the future of the success of this country depends on Hispanics having opportunities and the tools they need to succeed,"" he said Sept. 15. ""I know my team here knows, my new team, that 24 of every 100 kids in school today speak Spanish."" In an interview with Telemundo the same day, he made a similar statement about students, that 24 out of 100 ""are Latinos, Spanish speaking."" We’ve heard Biden deliver a version of this statistic since 2019, when he vowed to invest in education, including for Hispanic children. His campaign website said one-quarter of school children are Latino, but on the trail, Biden sometimes says about one-quarter of students are Latino and speak Spanish. Those two statements aren’t the same, because not all Latino children speak Spanish.  We asked Biden’s campaign to provide evidence for the statistic. We didn’t get a reply by deadline. RELATED: Trump retweets manipulated video falsely suggesting Biden played ‘F--- Tha Police’ at Florida event When Biden says about one-quarter of U.S. public school students are Latino, he is on firm ground.

In the United States, about 17% of all public school students speak Spanish, Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer and expert on immigration at the Pew Research Center told us.  Pew researchers looked at the same 2018 data for Florida only, and found that about 24% of public school students speak Spanish at home (and most of those students are Hispanic). State Education Department data for the 2019-20 school year showed that about 20% of public school students speak Spanish as their native language.  Not all young Hispanics speak Spanish.

Trump exaggerates North Carolina ballot mishap
","President Trump believes he sees signs of potential election corruption in North Carolina. ""Just out: Some people in the Great State of North Carolina have been sent TWO BALLOTS. RIGGED ELECTION in waiting!"" he tweeted on Thursday. North Carolina could prove key for Trump in the upcoming election, and he has previously  tweeted questionable information about the state.  So is this more recent tweet true? Election officials in Mecklenburg County this week announced that a mixup with the first wave of absentee ballots caused some voters to receive two identical ballots, the Associated Press reported. Fewer than 500 voters were affected, Mecklenburg’s election director Michael Dickerson told the AP. As for the suggestion that North Carolina’s election could be ""rigged,"" North Carolina’s election director said the state’s ballot management system will not allow a voter to vote twice in an election. ""Each absentee voter has a unique identifier barcode for their return application, and the state system will not permit two ballots from the same person to be accepted or counted,"" Karen Brinson Bell said in a statement on Thursday. ""Once one ballot is returned and accepted, the voter’s record reflects that he or she has already voted,"" she said. ""Therefore, if that voter returned another ballot, it would not count. The state has already processed 88,000 of 817,000 ballots that have been mailed out, she said. The president’s claim contains an element of truth: an elections board sent two ballots to about 500 voters. But it ignores some very important context: North Carolina election officials say their ballot-counting system doesn’t allow an individual’s quote to be counted twice. That means this type of mistake is very unlikely to alter or ""rig"" the election, as Trump suggests.

Baldwin flip-flops on SCOTUS nominations in a presidential election year
","An already tense and divisive election cycle added another layer with the passing of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The 87-year-old was one of four justices nominated by Democratic presidents. So if Republican President Donald Trump is successful in his stated desire to get a successor confirmed before his term expires, conservatives would hold a 6-3 majority on the high court. The situation creates a fascinating case study in partisan consistency — or the lack thereof — since it’s basically a mirror image of 2016.  Then, the passing of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia cleared the way for Democratic President Barack Obama to nominate Merrick Garland in March 2016. Republicans who controlled the Senate protested the election year nomination, refusing to hold a confirmation hearing or vote. Wisconsin’s Democratic Senator, Tammy Baldwin, spoke in 2016 and again this year about what she felt the Senate’s responsibility should be. That makes this a good time to break out our Flip-O-Meter, and with it our requisite reminder:  We’re not measuring whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. We’re just examining whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views. PolitiFact National gave a Full Flop rating to Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer for switching their views on this topic since 2016. Has Baldwin also changed her stance? We should first note the timing in 2016 was different. Ginsburg’s death sparked a nomination fight that begins about a month and a half before the election — at a time when early voting has begun in some states. Garland, on the other hand, was nominated a full eight months before the 2016 election, where Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. So we’ll keep that difference in mind as we analyze Baldwin’s stance. With a president from her party on the way out the door, Baldwin pushed strongly for the Republican-controlled Senate to put Garland’s nomination to a vote. She referenced the time left to the election in one interview. In April 2016, she told Green Bay’s Fox 11 News, ""President Obama was elected in 2012 to a full four-year term, not a three year and one-month term, and we can’t afford I think in this country an empty seat on the Supreme Court for nearly a full year."" But other times she referenced no such qualifier. ""It's the constitutional duty of the President to select a Supreme Court nominee and the Senate has the responsibility to give that nominee fair consideration with a hearing and a vote,"" she said in a March 2016 news release. ""Our job is to fulfill our constitutional duties and Senate Republicans need to end their partisan obstruction and do their jobs on this high court vacancy."" In August 2016, closer to the timing of this vacancy, Baldwin was still pushing for a vote, noting in a tweet that Garland had been waiting 147 days. She regularly attached #DoYourJob to her tweets calling for that action. Baldwin’s position in 2020 hinges on the differences in timing and the precedent created by the Senate’s inaction in 2016. Baldwin’s Sept. 19, 2020, statement said this: ""The election that will determine our next President and control of the Senate is only 45 days away. Voters across America should be allowed to cast their ballots first, before a Supreme Court nomination and confirmation process moves forward."" The release noted the Senate had ""put in place the standard"" in 2016 that Supreme Court nominations wouldn’t move forward in an election year. And she noted some people have already cast their votes for president. Baldwin’s staff noted the Senate has never confirmed a nomination to the Supreme Court this close to a presidential election, according to the Congressional Research Service. Defending her 2020 position, Baldwin notes the change in precedent, as she argues the Republicans’ inaction in 2016 is reason to approach the 2020 nomination the same way. And she notes the timing is different being closer to the election. The timing and precedent can factor in to how voters view her position now. But it doesn’t change the simple fact that her position changed.  Baldwin asserted in 2016 that presidents are elected ""to a full four-year term,"" and that certainly applies to Trump as it did to Obama. And she said in 2016 — without any reference to timing — that the Senate ""has the responsibility to give that nominee fair consideration with a hearing and a vote.""  We rate this a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2020/sep/22/tammy-baldwin/baldwin-flip-flops-scotus-nominations-presidential/

Johnson flip-flops on SCOTUS nominations in a presidential election year
","The passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg creates an unusual election-year vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. And it generates a unique opportunity to examine the role of party politics in the process, since it’s basically a mirror-image of the 2016 situation. In March 2016, Democratic President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland about eight months before the election following the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Now — a month and a half before a presidential election — we have a Republican president filling a spot created by the passing of a Democrat-appointed justice. If President Donald Trump is successful in his stated desire to get a successor confirmed before his term expires, conservatives would hold a 6-3 majority on the high court. The pending showdown between Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Senate — which must approve any nomination — makes this a good opportunity to check in on Wisconsin’s Republican senator, Ron Johnson, has approached the two situations. For that, we’ll break out our Flip-O-Meter, and our standard reminder: We’re not measuring whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. We’re just examining whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views. PolitiFact National gave a Full Flop rating to Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer for switching their views on this topic since 2016. Has Johnson also changed his tune with a different party in the White House? The 2016 situation was notably different given the longer time before the election, but Johnson still said that the eight-month window four years ago was too close for an outgoing president to put forth a nominee. ""In the politicized atmosphere of an election year, you probably shouldn't even nominate someone,"" he told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in March 2016. ""It's not fair to the nominee, it's not fair to the court."" In a news release two months later, he made a similar assertion. ""Let the American people have a voice in the composition of the Supreme Court,"" Johnson said in the May 2016 statement. ""Instead of a lame duck president and Senate nominating and confirming, a new president and Senate – elected by the people only a few months from now – should make that important decision. I can’t think of a fairer or more democratic process."" In another May 2016 interview, he told reporters the government should let voters ""decide the direction of the court through their votes."" Now, Johnson says ""the Senate should vote"" on Trump’s forthcoming nominee, despite the closeness of the election. Defending that position, he said things are different now because the Senate and White House are both held by Republicans. ""We had divided government (in 2016). That’s a valid argument when you have divided government (saying) 'Let’s let the American people decide.' Right now, we don’t have divided government,"" he told the Journal Sentinel for a Sept. 19, 2020, story. ""That makes all the difference in the world."" Asked to elaborate on how letting the voters decide wouldn’t apply in this situation, Johnson told the paper, ""it's just the reality of the situation."" Johnson also noted on Twitter that John Roberts (23 days) and Sandra Day O’Connor (33 days) were confirmed in less time than the gap between now and the election — assuming Trump brings a nominee forth quickly. Among the 11 justices nominated since 1990, however, the average time to confirmation has been 66 days. Johnson said in 2016 that an election-year Supreme Court vacancy should be delayed until after the election to ""let the American people have a voice,"" calling it a ""more democratic process."" But in 2020 — even though the election is six months closer — Johnson says the spot should be filled immediately. Of course, the president is now a Republican, whereas a Democrat brought forth the nomination in 2016. Johnson is arguing his statements aren’t contradictory because now the Senate and president are both from the same party, which wasn’t true in 2016. But Johnson offered no such qualifier in 2016. He simply said a nomination shouldn’t be made or confirmed in an election year. He’s attempting to retroactively make a distinction based on party control, but that only speaks to how likely a nomination is to be approved, not whether it’s proper to approve a nomination in an election year. That means Johnson has completely reversed his position. We rate this a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2020/sep/22/ron-johnson/johnson-flip-flops-scotus-nominations-presidential/

COVID-19 rules second only to slavery on civil liberties intrusions? Barr gets it wrong
","Attorney General William Barr made the case that while the COVID-19 pandemic is grave, the response should be measured. Governors who issued sweeping rules to keep the spread of the virus in check, he said, were treating ""free citizens as babies that can’t take responsibility for themselves."" ""Putting a national lockdown, stay-at-home orders, is like house arrest,"" Barr said Sept. 16 at an event sponsored by Michigan’s Hillsdale College. ""Other than slavery, which was a different kind of restraint, this is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history."" Putting social distancing rules second only to slavery as a violation of civil liberties drew criticism. House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., called it ""the most ridiculous, tone-deaf, God-awful thing I've ever heard.""  As fact-checkers, we looked at whether recent public health-driven restrictions on businesses and public gatherings exceeded the harm of other episodes in America’s past. Compared, for example, to the denial of voting rights to millions of Black Americans, we found Barr’s claim fell short. His depiction of the COVID-19 restrictions also seemed exaggerated. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 44 states plus Washington, D.C. issued some form of stay-at-home order as the pandemic hit the nation. Generally, those orders shut offices, restaurants, bars and any other business judged to be nonessential.  States enjoy broad legal authority to protect the general welfare. In 1905, the U.S. Supreme Court laid down a standard that still applies today. So long as the state’s restrictions have a substantive connection to public health, they tend to pass legal muster. That said, opponents of Pennsylvania’s stay-at-home orders won at least a temporary victory when a federal judge ruled major portions of that state’s order unconstitutional. The ruling is under appeal. Challenges in other states have been common, with judges often backing the governors. The U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear an appeal from a Nevada church to hold in-person services. Broadly, state orders directed people to stay home, but they offered many exceptions. West Virginia’s was typical. Residents could leave to ""engage in outdoor activity,"" buy groceries, attend religious services, and visit other family members, to name a few permitted reasons.  While Barr painted these orders as similar to house arrest, the comparison is dicey. The terms of house arrest can range from an evening curfew to an absolute requirement to stay in the home. But regardless of how strict or loose they are, house arrest orders are closely enforced, often through the use of tracking devices. The COVID-19 orders did not reach that level of enforcement, although states often had the option to charge violators with misdemeanors, and in some instances, people were charged. The economic impact has been severe. Well over 11 million Americans lost their jobs due to the virus and remain unemployed. Tens of millions faced a temporary loss of income, and thousands of businesses suffered. The shutdown orders had an immediate effect on the lives of millions of Americans. We asked over a dozen historians if they could think of instances in post-slavery America that might be worse than shutting down restaurants, offices and many other enterprises for several months.  Without any suggestion that this list is fully inclusive, here are a few examples they offered as ""the greatest intrusion on civil liberties"" other than slavery. Between 1900 and 1940, there were nearly 2,000 lynchings. Black people accounted for over 90% of the victims. White mobs attacked entire communities. In 1919, government soldiers, armed with rifles and seven machine guns, and aided by white vigilantes, attacked the Black residents of Elaine, Ark. Over a span of five days, they killed many and burned farms and buildings throughout the region. In 1921, a mob of white people turned the Black neighborhood of Greenwood in Tulsa, Okla., to rubble. Estimates of the death toll range from 75 to 300. In 1923, Rosewood, Fla., suffered the same fate. There are many other examples. Turning to voting rights, states, mainly but not exclusively in the South, systematically denied the franchise to millions of citizens. ""Black voter participation, which in some places had been 90% of eligible male voters in the late 1860s and early 1870s, was cut to essentially zero by the early decades of the 20th century,"" Harvard Law School professor Michael J. Klarman told us when we looked at the history of this in 2011. ""Jim Crow regimes involved relentless efforts to stop all African Americans from voting and included brutal intimidation tactics, like lynching,"" said Heather Gerken, a Yale Law School professor.  Home mortgages were beyond the reach of Black families due to Federal Housing Administration rules. Between 1930 and 1950, 98% of private mortgages were insured by the FHA. Only 2% of borrowers were non-white. The presence of Black people in a neighborhood was deemed a risk factor that discouraged lending. The policy denied Blacks people the same chance to accumulate wealth that white people enjoyed. During World War I, Congress passed the Espionage and Sedition Acts to bolster the country in its battle against Germany. The Sedition Act outlawed any criticism of the war. Columbia University historian Eric Foner called the period ""the most intense repression of civil liberties the nation has ever known."" ""Two thousand people were prosecuted for speech or press violations,"" said Oakland University professor emeritus Robert Justin Goldstein. ""One thousand were jailed. Eugene Debs (a trade union activist and Socialist Party candidate) was jailed for opposing the draft."" Goldstein, author of ""Political Repression in Modern America: From 1870 to 1975,"" tells the story of a filmmaker who received a 10-year sentence for a movie about the American Revolution. ""It was called ‘The Spirit of 1776,’"" and it included a scene with British soldiers committing atrocities against Americans,"" Goldstein said. ""That got him in trouble. At the time, we were fighting (along) with the British, and the movie was seen as undercutting that."" As the Great Depression hit the U.S., people of Mexican descent were blamed for draining public resources. Secretary of Labor William Doak said deportation was essential for reducing unemployment.  Immigration agents conducted raids across the country, but the largest number of removals took place in Southern California. By one estimate, local, state and federal officials deported nearly 2 million people, many of them minors born in the United States. ""More than half of those — about 1.2 million — were U.S. citizens, returned to a country where they had never been before and where they had few if any, rights, because they were not Mexican citizens,"" said Yale historian Laura Barraclough. The program also undercut the freedom of American firms to conduct business. Farms struggled to find field workers, and in 1931, at a time when banks were in crisis, California reported a loss of $7 million in bank deposits as departing customers took their money with them to Mexico. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order in February 1942 to remove anyone on the West Coast judged to be a threat to national security. The move was aimed at Japanese Americans. In congressional hearings, Justice Department officials objected on constitutional grounds, and the work of forced relocation was put in the hands of the U.S. Army. Within six months in 1942, 122,000 people were sent to inland internment centers. About 70,000 of them were U.S. citizens.  ""Japanese Americans who evacuated often left without anything but a suitcase or two, and most never recovered their losses of homes, businesses, and possessions,"" said Northwestern University’s Shana Bernstein. ""The violation of civil liberties was so egregious that President Ronald Reagan officially apologized for it."" A 1983 commission put their property losses at $1.3 billion. No list could be fully inclusive. For scale and brutality, the forced relocation and killings of Native Americans in the 19th century loomed large for several historians.  In the 20th century, both the federal government and the states curtailed liberties in Americans’ private lives. Under the Comstock Act of 1873, it was a federal crime to distribute birth control materials through the mail or across state lines, even for married couples.  Many states also banned interracial marriage. That stood until 1967, when the U.S. Supreme Court took the case of Loving v the State of Virginia. Two Virginia residents were convicted and sentenced to a year in jail for violating the state’s miscegenation law. The judge offered to suspend the sentence if they left the state and didn’t return for 25 years. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1967 that miscegenation laws violated the 14th Amendment and were ""odious to a free people."" Other historians also listed the government study in collaboration with Tuskegee University that denied treatment for syphilis to over 600 Black men between 1932 and 1972. The government’s goal was to track the long-term effects of untreated disease. By the late 1940s, penicillin was the standard treatment but was never provided. Barr said that COVID-19 stay-at-home orders were like house arrest and represented ""the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history"" since slavery. While efforts to contain the coronavirus have brought hardship to millions of people, public health restrictions, while challenged, have largely passed legal muster. On the flipside, denying the right to vote to millions of Black people, terrorizing Black communities, jailing people for voicing an opinion, and forcibly relocating or deporting over a million citizens go against core principles of the Constitution. Suffering is not easily quantified, and we recognize that actions taken in the past that were not ruled at the time as having violated civil rights are viewed differently through history’s lens. But the scale and force of assaults on civil liberties in the past outweigh the infringements due to COVID-19. We rate this claim False.

Bob Good misrepresents Joe Biden's tax plan
","Joe Biden will raise taxes on 82% of Americans, according to Bob Good, a Republican seeking Virginia’s 5th District congressional seat. Good, a former Campbell County supervisor, made the claim during a Sept. 9 candidates forum with Democrtaic nominee Cameron Webb, a physician. ""We need to preserve and expand the Trump tax cuts,"" Good said. ""Biden has already announced that he and my opponent would raise taxes by $4 trillion on 82% of Americans who would experience a tax increase if Biden were elected (sic),"" Good said. We fact checked Good’s 82% claim.  Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, has pledged not to raise taxes on Americans making less than $400,000 per year, as PolitiFact has reported. Independent tax analysts have found that his plan does not call for direct tax increases on anyone below that threshold. Tax analysts say the indirect effects of Biden’s proposal to raise the corporate tax rate could mean slightly lower after-tax incomes for some lower earners. By one analysis, about 82% of Americans would feel these effects — though for many, the hit would be small.  But that doesn’t mean  82% of Americans will have higher tax rates or owe more to the Internal Revenue Service, as the phrase ""tax increase"" suggests.  ""To the extent that the Trump campaign is using this figure to imply that individual income and payroll taxes will rise for 82% of Americans, the claim is misleading,"" said John Ricco, a senior analyst at the Penn Wharton Budget Model, which is the basis for the 82% figure. Biden’s pledge for no direct taxes under $400,000 Biden’s tax plan aims to raise up to $4 trillion in revenues over a decade, according to the Tax Policy Center. It would do so in part by rolling back some of the tax cuts for corporations and people with taxable incomes over $400,000 that Trump signed into law in 2017. Among Biden’s proposed changes, he would: Increase the top corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%; Raise the top federal marginal income tax rate from 37% to 39.6%; Place a 12.4% Social Security payroll tax on incomes above $400,000; and Tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners. Other independent groups have also examined Biden’s tax plan, including the Tax Foundation, the Penn Wharton Budget Model, the American Enterprise Institute, and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The groups have generally agreed that Biden’s plan largely targets corporations and the nation’s biggest earners. The Tax Policy Center, for example, estimated that more than 90% of the tax increases from Biden’s plan would be borne by the top 20% of earners. ""No direct taxes are imposed on any household making less than $400,000 per year,"" the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in its analysis.  Garrett Watson, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, told PolitiFact National there are some specific scenarios where Biden’s proposals related to itemized deductions, retirement benefits and payroll taxes could result in ""potential direct tax hikes"" for some households under $400,000. For example, in a scenario where one spouse makes more than $400,000 but the other incurs a loss that brings the adjusted gross income for their two-income household below $400,000, they could be hit by the Biden payroll tax, Watson said. In interviews, economic advisers to the Biden campaign said any final tax law would have mechanisms written in to prevent anybody making less than $400,000 from being inadvertently affected. ""It’s not hard to have a ‘hold harmless’ provision to deal with any oddball cases that seem unlikely to even ever arise,"" said Gene Sperling, a campaign adviser who was director of the National Economic Council under Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Lower earners could see small, indirect hits The groups that examined Biden’s tax plan also estimated that over time, some of the burden of Biden’s tax increases would fall to people making less than $400,000 in the form of lower wages or investment returns — indirect effects of the proposed corporate tax rate increase. These effects would be relatively small, and tax analysts say they make up the bulk of the hits dealt to lower earners under Biden’s tax plan. But they form the basis for Good’s claim that 82% of Americans would see their taxes raised. President Donald Trump’s campaign says the impact of the corporate tax rate increase is effectively a tax increase on individuals.  The Biden campaign, on the other hand, says the two are not equal. ""Nobody filling out their 1040 is going to see a tax increase, and nobody would consider that type of economic impact as a tax increase, even if it happened,"" said Sperling. According to the Tax Policy Center, the lowest 20% of earners would see their 2021 incomes drop by an average of $30 under Biden; the second lowest quintile would see an average loss of $110; the middle would see an average drop of $260; and the second-highest quintile would see an average loss of $590.  The Penn Wharton Budget Model  projects smaller average declines for 2021: $15 for the bottom 20%; $90 for the second quintile; $180 for the third quintile; and $360 for the fourth quintile. Good’s 82% figure comes from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, which estimated what share of each income group would experience a tax change as a result of Biden’s proposals. A little math gets to 82% of people affected. But the concept of indirect effects ""is distinct from how most normal people think about taxes,"" said Ricco, the Penn Wharton analyst. ""Only families with adjusted gross incomes of more than $400,000 would be sending a larger check to the IRS, or having more federal taxes withheld from their paychecks,"" Ricco said. Those taxpayers were between the top 1% and 2% of filers in 2017, said Watson, the Tax Foundation analyst, citing the IRS. The Penn Wharton Budget Model also shows how Biden’s tax plan would affect Americans if the indirect effects of the corporate tax are excluded. With the corporate tax plan removed from the analysis, the average tax change drops to zero for the bottom 90% of earners. ""We expect that between 1% and 2% of American families would see increases in individual income and payroll taxes,"" Ricco said.  A final note: We asked Good’s campaign three times for information and did not get a reply. Other considerations There are other aspects of Biden’s plans that aren’t reflected in independent tax analyses.  The Trump campaign, for example, says Biden’s plan to reinstate the penalty for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate (requiring most people to have a basic amount of health care coverage) should be thought of as a tax — which is in line with the Supreme Court’s reasoning when it upheld the mandate in 2012. The Biden campaign says it’s a fee, pointing to the Health and Human Services Department’s language. Economic advisers to the Biden campaign, meanwhile, said the tax analyses don’t include Biden’s proposed tax credits and spending programs aimed at middle-class and lower earners. Those and other Biden proposals ""will substantially boost middle-class incomes for families across the country,"" said Biden campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates.  Gordon Mermin, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center, said Biden has proposed many tax credits, including recent proposals for a refundable child- and dependent-care tax credit, a refundable tax credit for first-time homebuyers, and a low-income renters credit. If the Penn Wharton Budget Model factored in Biden’s tax credits — and it did not — then the 82% figure representing the percent of Americans who would experience changes to their after-tax incomes ""would be substantially lower,"" Mermin said.  Ricco said the Penn Wharton analysis focused only on ""revenue-raising provisions.""  Note: We reached out to Good’s campaign three times and did not get a reply. Our ruling Good said ""82% of Americans...would experience a tax increase if Biden were elected.""  Good inaccurately described an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model. The 82% is a calculation made using the model’s estimates that represents the percentage of people whose after-tax incomes would change under Biden’s plan. But there’s a difference between a tax increase and the share of corporate tax increases borne by individual taxpayers in the form or lower investment returns or incomes. Biden has pledged not to directly raise taxes on people earning less than $400,000 per year.  Some Biden tax credits not included in Penn Wharton analysis could potentially offset some of the indirect hits posed to lower earners as a result of Biden’s proposed corporate tax hike.

DOJ didn’t indict someone in Texas for fraudulently casting 1,700 ballots
","Attorney General William Barr made the case that voting by mail is ""fraught with the risk of fraud and coercion.""  As an example of such problems, he pointed to a case in Texas. ""We indicted someone in Texas, 1,700 ballots collected from people who could vote, he made them out and voted for the person he wanted to,"" Barr said in an interview on CNN on Sept. 2. The U.S. Justice Department has already walked back this claim, but social media posts continue to echo the attorney general’s inaccurate statement.  One, from Sept. 17, attributes to Barr a paraphrased statement of what he actually said: ""‘In Texas, we arrested one man who filled out 1,700 ballots. That’s what happens with mail-in ballots.’ - AG Barr."" The Justice Department did not immediately respond to our email about Barr’s statement.  But here’s what we know from media reports.  The Justice Department did not indict someone in Texas for casting 1,700 ballots. A spokesperson for the department told the Washington Post that prior to his CNN interview, Barr was ""provided a memo prepared within the department that contained an inaccurate summary about the case which he relied upon when using the case as an example."" In 2017, prosecutors in Dallas County, in Texas, investigated suspected mail-in voter fraud after receiving a tip that voters who had not requested mail ballots received notices that they would receive them, according to the Washington Post.  The name ""Jose Rodriguez"" appeared on about 700 ballots, indicating that this person helped fill them out. Andy Chatham, who was the assistant district attorney on the case at the time, said that when investigators approached the voters who were said to have cast the ballots, the voters generally said the ballots were legitimate and cast for the candidate they supported, the Post reported.  ""We didn’t find any evidence of widespread voter fraud, and instead the ballots that were returned were consistent with the voter’s choice,"" the paper quotes Chatham as saying.  Ultimately, one suspect was arrested in the case — Miguel Hernandez, who pleaded guilty to forging a woman’s signature on a mail-in ballot in a Dallas County municipal election, the Dallas Morning News reported. Elderly voters had alleged that someone forged their signatures on mail-in ballots in a 2017 Dallas City Council race.  ""He violated the law but not for voting,"" Chatham told ABC News. ""It was for procuring mail-in ballots under false pretenses."" Mike Snipes, another prosecutor, said investigators initially suspected that there were potentially 1,700 fraudulent ballots, ""but we did not uncover that, at all,"" the Post quotes him as saying. ""We actually thought there was voter fraud initially and we couldn’t find it except that little tiny case.""  Our ruling Barr said that the Justice Department indicted someone in Texas for casting 1,700 fraudulent mail-in ballots in Texas.  Prosecutors investigated about 700 ballots — not 1,700 — for possible fraud.  But investigators never found evidence of widespread fraud, and the ballots under scrutiny were cast in favor of the candidates the voter supported.  ""Everyone who voted in it, their vote counted,"" Chatham told the Morning News.

Biden’s false claim about when Trump campaign called for Supreme Court list
","As Republicans look to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death, President Donald Trump’s campaign has elevated its calls for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to release a list of candidates he would consider for the bench. Trump and his campaign have challenged Biden to match the list of 20 potential nominees Trump rolled out Sept. 9, which included several federal appeals court judges and Republican senators such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.  Biden has dismissed those requests. Speaking in Philadelphia two days after Ginsburg’s death, the former vice president rejected the call again, while urging the Republican-led Senate to let the winner of the presidential election pick Ginsburg’s replacement.  In doing so, Biden wrongly claimed the Trump campaign asked for his list only after Ginsburg died. (He also claimed, falsely, that ""there's no court session between now and the end of this election."") ""After Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away, they said ‘Biden should release his list,’"" Biden said in the Sept. 20 address. ""It’s no wonder the Trump campaign asked that I release the list only after she passed away. It’s a game for them. It’s a play to gin up emotions and anger.""  The Biden campaign noted that the claim came as Biden diverged slightly from his prepared remarks, which the campaign provided to PolitiFact. His prepared line was: ""It’s no wonder the Trump campaign asked that I release a list only hours after Justice Ginsburg passed away."" Both Trump and his campaign called several times for Biden to put out a list of prospective nominees before Ginsburg’s death on Sept. 18. When the campaign unveiled the 20 additions to Trump’s list in a Sept. 9 press release, it wrote, ""Biden must do the same.""   Hey @JoeBiden,Trump Campaign here!We asked for your prospective SCOTUS nominee list on September 9th, 2020.https://t.co/d5Xo94EGab Trump’s campaign staff cited that announcement and other examples disproving Biden’s claim on Twitter and on its website, and the campaign flagged a few more in response to an inquiry: On Sept. 17, the Trump campaign released a statement saying ""it’s time for Joe Biden to release a list of his own potential Supreme Court nominees."" On Sept. 12, Trump said at a campaign rally in Minden, Nev., ""I put out a list of an additional number of very conservative, highly thought of, highly respected judges ... They are the only people that I will consider for the Supreme Court of the United States. And I'm asking Joe Biden to do the same thing."" On Sept. 9, Trump said at the White House, ""Joe Biden has refused to release his list, perhaps because he knows the names are so extremely far left that they could never withstand public scrutiny or receive acceptance."" On Aug. 24, Trump said in an Aug. 24 Republican National Convention speech, ""I'm demanding, actually, a list. Let Biden put up a list of the judges he's going to appoint."" Trump made similar statements during a  June 22 interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network and a June 20 campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla. The Trump campaign has ramped up its calls for a Biden list since Ginsburg’s death. But in Philadelphia, Biden gave three reasons why he didn’t want to publish the names of his potential nominees — and why he thought Trump’s decision to do so was unconventional. Biden argued that putting judges’ names on such a list could influence their decisions in courts where they currently serve, subject them to ""unrelenting political attacks"" without an immediate hearing at which to defend themselves, and upend the traditional process of consulting with the Senate on nominees. Trump put out a similar list as a candidate in 2016. In June, Biden told reporters he was thinking about qualified African American women with ""the experience to be on the court."" Biden said, ""The Trump campaign asked that I release the list (of potential Supreme Court nominees) only after (Ginsburg) passed away.""

"['Congress', 'Supreme Court', 'Mitch McConnell']","
Mitch McConnell flip-flops on considering Supreme Court justices in a presidential election year
","When Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said a vote on the next Supreme Court justice shouldn’t be held during an election year.  McConnell blocked a vote on Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, for most of 2016, and the newly elected president, Donald Trump, filled it instead. The Sept. 18 death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg now leaves the court with another vacancy, this time less than seven weeks before the Nov. 3 election. But now, McConnell said Trump’s nomination will receive a vote. Democrats called it the height of hypocrisy and double standards. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., even quoted McConnell’s 2016 rationale verbatim in a tweet that said ""Americans should have a voice."" We researched McConnell’s past statements. From the beginning, he said the Senate should wait for elections to decide the next president who would choose Scalia’s replacement. On numerous occasions, he offered an artfully crafted justification that cited historical precedent to uphold that position, but that doesn’t change the fact that he is not waiting on the voters to speak in 2020  as he had argued in 2016. Ultimately, experts told us that McConnell would have been more honest to simply explain that he’s pursuing a Supreme Court confirmation this late in the election cycle because he has the power to do so. McConnell’s short remembrance of Scalia upon the news of his death ended with the revelation that he would reject any nominee from Obama during his final year. At the time, the election was almost 10 months away. ""The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,"" McConnell said in a Feb. 13, 2016, statement. The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. #Scalia https://t.co/QXHfOpEY6G On that first night, there were no further caveats. Subsequently, in some settings, McConnell stuck to this line without elaboration (once adding #LetThePeopleDecide). Many Republican senators picked up the argument that it was too close to the presidential election to pursue confirmation. But McConnell would come to repeat a caveat that left open a path of consistency if the shoe were ever on the other foot. McConnell said on several occasions that the Senate had not confirmed a nominee from a president of the opposite party since 1888. For instance, in March 2016, McConnell said on Fox News Sunday, ""You have to go back 80 years to find the last time a vacancy on the Supreme Court created in a presidential election year was filled. You have to go back to 1888 when Grover Cleveland was in the White House to find the last time when a vacancy was created in a presidential year, a Senate controlled (by the) party opposite the president confirmed."" With the Senate majority and White House both in Republican hands today, McConnell revived the caveated version of the justification he used in 2016. ""In the last midterm election before Justice Scalia’s death in 2016, Americans elected a Republican Senate majority because we pledged to check and balance the last days of a lame-duck president’s second term,"" McConnell said in his Sept. 18 statement. ""We kept our promise. Since the 1880s, no Senate has confirmed an opposite-party president’s Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year."" McConnell made this point again a few days later in his first Senate floor speech after Ginsburg’s death.  However, claims like this obfuscate the fact that Supreme Court vacancies in presidential election years are rare — and there was no consistent pattern of punting on a nomination. One problem with parsing precedents for handling past Supreme Court vacancies in an election year is that there are only a few historical examples to look at, and each has quirks that make them different. For instance, Scalia’s death and Ginsburg’s both created vacancies, but Scalia’s came 268 days before Election Day while Ginsburg’s came just 46 days before the election, at which point voting in some places had already begun. ""What we have is a framing war that reflects the values of each side, one that ultimately spins, picks and chooses the facts, perspectives, and structures of the discussion,"" said Colorado State University political scientist Kyle Saunders.  Previous ""rules"" addressing the handling of election-year Supreme Court nominations, including one attributed to the late Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., in 1968 and one offered by then-Sen. Joe Biden in 1992, have been cited frequently, but they carry no official force, said Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis.  If McConnell’s overarching argument in 2016 was that the public should be able to weigh in on the nomination, then he’s offered a different standard for 2020, Smith added. In February 2016, McConnell said the expression of popular sentiment would occur in the coming November election. But in September 2020, McConnell indicated that the public expression has already been made by electing a president and Senate majority in the past, in 2016 and 2018. ""To say, ‘We blocked the opposing party’s nominee in 2016 because we controlled the Senate, and we will vote on our own party’s nominee in 2020 because we control the Senate’ is merely to say, ‘We control the Senate and will do what we wish, regardless of the occupant of the White House,’"" said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University historian. ""No actual rule is being articulated."" In addition, a majority of voters rejected Trump in 2016, and in both 2016 and 2018, Democrats won more votes for Senate seats than Republicans did, said John J. Pitney Jr., a Claremont McKenna College political scientist. ""Principle, schminciple — it's all about power,"" Pitney said. McConnell’s position in 2016 was not to hear a Supreme Court justice nominee in an election year. ""The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice,"" he said on the night of Scalia’s death. In 2020, his position has changed. He will no longer wait for the American people to decide in the next election.  In both cases, McConnell offered a justification that confirmations have proceeded when the presidency and the Senate are in unified control and have stalled when the two are under divided control. However, this isn’t a higher principle that led McConnell to his decision; it’s a cherry-picked, after-the-fact justification for the raw exercise of power he undoubtedly has. McConnell’s overarching stance on whether the people should weigh in on a nomination during the next election was different in 2016 and 2020.

Chuck Schumer flip-flops on confirming Supreme Court justices in a presidential election year
","Democrats and Republicans are taking Amerians down memory lane as they battle over a replacement for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died less than two months before Election Day. Both parties are accusing each other of hypocrisy and arguing that they are not sticking to the standards they’ve set for themselves regarding the appropriate timing for the confirmation of a Supreme Court justice during a presidential election year. The stakes are high: Supreme Court justices are appointed for life and their decisions impact generations of people. PolitiFact examined the recent statements of Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and contrasted them with their statements in 2016, after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. We rated McConnell’s current stance a Full Flop. Graham’s position is also a Full Flop. The day Ginsburg, a Clinton administration appointee, died, Democratic minority leader Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York tweeted, ""The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president."" This is precisely what McConnell said in February 2016 after the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a Reagan administration appointee. The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president. Let’s use our Flip-O-Meter to look at how Schumer’s present position compares with his past stance on the confirmation of Supreme Court justices during a presidential election year. The point of the Flip-O-Meter is to track whether an official flips or remains consistent on an issue. The Flip-O-Meter does not make a value judgment about flip-flopping. Some people say changing positions shows inconsistent principles and lack of backbone. Others say it's just pragmatism and willingness to compromise. RELATED: How Republicans could fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat, explained Schumer in 2016 urged the Senate to schedule a hearing and a vote for Judge Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s nominee to replace Scalia. In a Feb. 16, 2016, Medium post, Schumer said the Senate had a constitutional obligation to hold hearings and a full confirmation process for Obama’s pick. Schumer said he believed Obama, who was ending his second term, would nominate a ""mainstream candidate who can and should earn bipartisan support."" (Obama nominated Garland in March 2016.) Facing criticism for that position given remarks he made in 2007, Schumer also argued in that Medium post that Republicans were misconstruing his 2007 statements on the topic of Supreme Court nominations. ""What I said in the speech given in 2007 is simple: Democrats, after a hearing, should entertain voting no if the nominee is out of the mainstream and tries to cover that fact up. There was no hint anywhere in the speech that there shouldn’t be hearings or a vote."" He added: ""Nor was there any hint that this idea that Democrats should oppose hard right ideologues should apply only in the fourth year of the president’s term. In fact, I said it should apply to this president, George W. Bush, or any future president whenever they nominated such a candidate."" (Here’s a link to that 2007 speech to the American Constitution Society during George W. Bush’s administration.) Here are more examples of Schumer’s 2016 rhetoric: Feb. 18, 2016 tweet: ""[email protected]’s constitutional responsibility is to nominate a #SCOTUS Justice. The Senate’s job is to hold hearings & vote on nominees #DoYourJob."" Feb. 22, 2016 tweet: ""Attn GOP: Senate has confirmed 17 #SCOTUS justices in presidential election years. #DoYourJob."" Sept. 27, 2016 Senate speech: ""The Supreme Court handles ‘the people’s business,’ as President Reagan put it. Every day that goes by without a ninth justice is another day the American people’s business is not getting done."" Schumer opposes the confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee in 2020 and justifies his opposition by citing the precedent set by Republicans in 2016. Since Republicans hold the majority in the Senate in 2020 (same as 2016), the party has the power to control the confirmation process. McConnell in 2016 refused to hold a confirmation hearing for Obama’s nominee. On Sept. 20, Schumer said that Ginsburg’s last wish was that she not be replaced until a new president is inaugurated. Schumer claimed that polling found that the majority of Americans, 62%, agreed with Ginsburg. ""That’s such a high number it has to mean that Democrats, Republicans and independents all agree that it is only right and it is only fair for us to abide by RBG’s last wish, that she be replaced when a new president is installed,"" Schumer said during a press conference in New York. On Sept. 21, in a Senate floor speech, Schumer called on at least four Republican senators to commit to rejecting any nominee ""until the next president is installed."" (All Democratic senators and at least four Republicans would need to vote against a nominee to block his or her confirmation.) Schumer said that McConnell and Graham ""made a mockery of their previous position."" ""Why even bother constructing a pretense for your position? Why say it's this rule or that rule, and then do the exact opposite when it suits your interests? Why not just come to the floor and say, ‘I'm going to do what's ever best for my political party. Consistency be damned, reason be damned, democracy be damned.’ Just admit it. There's no shaping the cravenness of this position,"" he said. RELATED: In Context: Is there a 'Biden Rule' on Supreme Court nominations in a presidential election year? Schumer’s position in 2016 was to hold a hearing and a vote on a Supreme Court justice nominee in a presidential election year.  In 2020, his position has changed. He says the Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice in a presidential election year. Schumer justifies his 2020 position by citing Ginsburg’s reported last wish and the precedent set by Republicans in 2016. Schumer said, ""It is only right and it is only fair for us to abide by RBG’s last wish, that she be replaced when a new president is installed."" Schumer’s stance on the confirmation of a Supreme Court justice during a presidential election year was different in 2016 and 2020.
