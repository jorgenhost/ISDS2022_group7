No, Mike Pence wasn’t arrested
","Capitol police whisked Vice President Mike Pence out of the Senate chamber to safety on Jan. 6 as a mob of President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.  But on social media, some people reported that Pence had actually been arrested.  ""Multiple reports of Mike Pence being arrested,"" read one widely-shared Facebook post.

""Anyone involved must respect law enforcement officers and immediately leave the building.""  That evening, Devin O’Malley, Pence’s press secretary, tweeted that Pence had returned to the Senate to resume certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, a process that was interrupted by the intruders. ""He never left the Capitol,"" O’Malley said. ""@VP was in regular contact w/ House & Senate leadership, Cap Police, DOJ, & DoD to facilitate efforts to secure the Capitol & reconvene Congress."" A couple hours later, Americans could see for themselves that Pence wasn’t in custody when he presided over the televised joint session of Congress. ""Today was a dark day in the history of the United States Capitol,"" he said.

No, the FBI didn’t confirm antifa activists breached the Capitol
","Two days after a mob of President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol — an assault that caused lawmakers to flee and left five people dead — we’ve debunked several falsehoods blaming antifa for what happened.  There’s nothing to back up an assertion from Mo Brooks, a Republican congressman from Alabama, that ""evidence is growing"" that antifa activists orchestrated the attack. Similarly, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has wrongly said that the people who stormed the Capitol ""have been confirmed to be antifa.""  And the evidence that some people have pointed to — reports that a facial recognition firm confirmed that ""antifa infiltrated the Trump rally"" — is inaccurate. Rather, the company said it identified people associated with Nazi groups.  So we were skeptical of a supposed breaking news item circulating on Facebook by the end of the week.  ""The FBI just confirmed that it was ANTIFA, not Trump supporters who breached the Capital,"" the post said, misspelling Capitol. ""It’s reported that 2 captured had MAGA hats on as a ruse. Remember who ANTIFA works to promote and how they work. Now, when will you hear a retraction, apology or even this news on CNN? Don’t hold your breath. That’s not their policy.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On Jan. 8, FBI assistant director Steven D’Antuono said in a press briefing that the agency has ""no indication"" that antifa played a role in the riot. On Jan. 7, U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald and FBI special Agent in Charge Michael Paul, issued a joint statement on the violence at the Capitol. It mentioned neither antifa nor the president’s supporters, but said the FBI is ""seeking information that will assist in identifying individuals who are actively instigating violence in Washington D.C."" As we’ve previously reported, there’s no way to identify everyone who participated in the mayhem on Jan. 6. But no one claiming that antifa activists stormed the Capitol has provided legitimate proof, while the evidence that Trump supporters were involved is indisputable.

No, the Simpsons didn’t predict the Capitol riots. Those images are edited
","After almost every major news event, rumors tend to circulate online that claim ""The Simpsons,"" somehow predicted whatever it was that happened. It’s not like the animated TV show has never predicted the future — it has — a number of times, including Donald Trump’s election. But it didn’t foretell what happened on Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol, as some social media posts claim. ""The Simpsons did it again,"" said one viral Facebook post that features an image of the show’s character Groundskeeper Willie waving an American flag at the Capitol building dressed in the exact same horned garb as a costume donned by one of the Pro-Trump rioters who breached the building. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

First, it’s clear that, in an uncropped version of the photo, which shows that Willie is joined by the Simpson’s family at an animated Capitol building, that the characters were pasted onto the background. Second, this image of Willie has not appeared in any Simpsons episode. Willie has never been seen in any horned helmet, tattoos or American flag. The image of Willie used in this post showing the character with his arm raised appears to come from the Simpsons Tapped Out mobile game, as many pointed out online.

There’s no Harris plot to oust Biden and appoint Pence
","As Democratic leaders call on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove President Donald Trump, some people are speculating about how that power could be wielded in future administrations. And one wild theory is spreading on social media: that the incoming vice president will oust President-elect Joe Biden and tap Pence to replace her.  ""I heard a rumor @KamalaHarris is planning on pulling the 25th Amendment on @JoeBiden the minute he is sworn in, and then appointing @MikePence as her Vice-President,"" read one Facebook post. ""Is this true?"" It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reached out to former Senate candidate Shiva Ayyadurai, who wrote the Facebook post. Ayyadurai — who lost in the Massachusetts Republican primary — did not immediately respond to our email about the claim.    We also did not hear back from the Biden-Harris campaign.  But there is no evidence to substantiate this theory. A little background: The 25th Amendment says that if the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet declare that the president can no longer carry out his duties, the vice president would become the acting president. In October, following Trump’s diagnosis with COVID-19, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced a bill to establish a commission that could be tasked with determining if a president is no longer fit for office in accordance with the 25th Amendment. Soon after, Trump tweeted without evidence that Pelosi was ""looking at the 25th Amendment in order to replace Joe Biden with Kamala Harris."" There was no factual basis for that claim either. Now that the amendment is in the news again, Biden and Harris have not commented on calls to use it to remove Trump. ""President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris are focused on their duty — preparing to take office on Jan. 20 — and will leave it to Vice President Pence, the cabinet and the Congress to act as they see fit,"" Andrew Bates, a spokesperson for the Biden transition, told the New York Times.  We’ve previously fact-checked other unfounded allegations that hinge on the fears of some conservatives that Biden is a ""Trojan Horse"" for a Harris presidency. Some social media posts have included the inaccurate claim that Pelosi would automatically become Harris’ vice president. And we find no credible evidence to suggest that there is any discussion of Harris seeking to replace Biden once sworn in. It’s especially unfathomable that Harris, a Democrat, would nominate Pence, a Republican, as her vice president if she replaced Biden. If that were to happen, and Harris were then to leave the office of the president, she would effectively hand over power to the other party — Pence would become the new president.  The claim that Harris plans to oust Biden and appoint Pence as her vice president is False.

Texas Attorney General advances antifa conspiracy theory after Capitol riot
","Not long after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton addressed a large ""Save America"" rally of Trump loyalists outside the White House on Wednesday, they marched on the Capitol and breached the building as Congress sought to ratify President-elect Joe Biden’s electoral victory.  But Paxton had his own ideas about the mob carrying pro-Trump flags and signs.  On Thursday morning, he took to Facebook to advance a conspiracy theory that the people who overtook the Capitol were not Trump supporters, but members of antifa.  ""Those who stormed the capitol yesterday were not Trump supporters. They have been confirmed to be Antifa,"" Paxton wrote. ""Violence is not the answer.""  Paxton’s post cited two sources: a screenshot of a tweet by right-wing journalist Paul Sperry and a screenshot of a Washington Times article with the headline, ""Facial recognition firm claims antifa infiltrated Trump protestors who stormed capitol.""  On Wednesday, as Capitol Hill police removed the rioters from the Capitol, Paxton published something similar. People who stormed the building following a Trump rally ""are not Trump supporters,"" he tweeted, citing the screenshot of Sperry’s tweet.   ""BREAKING: Former F.B.I. agent on the ground at U.S. Capitol just texted me and confirmed that at least 1 ‘bus load’ of Antifa thugs infiltrated peaceful demonstrators as part of a false Trump flag ops,"" Sperry’s tweet reads.   Sperry's tweet has since been deleted. Sperry, a former Washington bureau chief for Investor's Business Daily, has authored several anti-Muslim books with titles like, ""Infiltration: How Muslim Spies and Subversives Have Penetrated Washington,"" and ""Muslim Mafia: Inside the Secret Underworld That’s Conspiring to Islamize America."" He has not responded to questions sent to him via email.  Paxton’s second source alleging that Wednesday’s mob is ""confirmed to be Antifa,"" the Washington Times article, was published about 8:15 p.m. Wednesday by news and opinion writer Rowan Scarborough. The story sources an unnamed ""retired military officer"" who told the Times ""that the firm XRVision used its software to do facial recognition of protesters and matched two Philadelphia Antifa members to two men inside the Senate."" The newspaper has since retracted the report, but not before Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, cited it later that day on the House floor, saying that ""some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and were in fact members of the violent terrorist group antifa.""  XRVision, a facial recognition technology company based in Singapore, issued a statement to PolitiFact and BuzzFeed News Thursday morning saying that the company sent the Washington Times a cease and desist letter asking it to retract the story and issue an apology. XRVision’s software identified two members of a Neo-Nazi organization and a Q-Anon supporter, not members of antifa. The company said it distributed that imagery to a handful of individuals for private consumption only.   The company said it does not know the identity of the ""retired military officer"" who gave the Washington Times the information it based its report on.  ""XRVision takes pride in its technology's precision and deems the Washington Times publication as outright false, misleading, and defamatory,"" the company said in its statement.   The Times issued a correction to the story at around 5:30 p.m. Thursday after an inquiry from PolitiFact, saying that ""The Washington Times erroneously reported late Wednesday that facial recognition technology backed up that speculation and identified two Antifa members. In fact, XRVision has not identified any members of that far-left movement as being part of the attack."" Paxton's office did not respond to a request for comment.  As Wednesday’s events turned chaotic, Trump himself identified the mob as his own supporters in a video posted to Twitter, where he asked them to disperse peacefully, adding, ""We love you. You’re very special.""  One of the rioters identified in multiple photographs, Jake Angeli, also known as the ""Q Shaman,"" easily spotted in his horned fur cap, rebuffed allegations that he was a masquerading member of antifa.   ""I am not antifa or (Black Lives Matter).

Paxton published two social media posts following Wednesday’s pro-Trump riot at Capitol Hill saying that the rioters were not Trump supporters, but antifa.   Paxton based his claim on two sources — a deleted tweet and a retracted Washington Times article. Beyond those dubious sources, there’s no evidence showing that those who stormed the capitol were antifa.   We rate Paxton’s claim Pants on Fire. ",/factchecks/2021/jan/08/ken-paxton/texas-attorney-general-falsely-states-antifa-storm/

Capitol Police, not Secret Service, shot and killed woman in U.S. Capitol assault
","The unprecedented Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol spawned a predictable array of online rhetoric about who was involved and what exactly happened. Many details were still emerging a day later, but we know the mob fueled by and in support of President Donald Trump forced its way into the House and Senate chambers after a series of f violent clashes with law enforcement. When the dust cleared, more than 50 police officers were injured and four people were dead — three from what authorities termed medical emergencies, and one from a gunshot wound. Wisconsin state Rep. Jonathan Brostoff, D-Milwaukee, focused on the woman shot and killed in a Jan. 7 tweet, describing the matter this way: ""The Trump Terrorist who was put down during the violent mob assault wasn’t (as they claimed) shot by the Capitol Police, they were (physically) on her side. Instead it was a secret service agent who discharged his firearm while doing his duty to protect democracy."" The Secret Service claim caught our eye. Let’s take a closer look. After an incendiary speech from Trump the morning of Jan. 6, thousands of his supporters marched to the Capitol. It was a gathering long planned and promoted online by Trump backers and conspiracy theorists. In what experts have called a catastrophic failure of security, the group not only moved through barriers around the building but broke through windows to enter the building itself.  The deadly showdown occurred in a hallway where Capitol Police had used furniture to barricade a glass door. Witness video (warning, graphic content) shows a plain-clothes officer standing with a gun drawn. He fires once as a woman later identified as Ashli Babbitt climbs through a broken window adjoining the door. Babbitt falls to the floor, where she is immediately treated by uniformed officers on her side of the barricade. A Jan. 7 news release by Capitol Police said she was taken to a nearby hospital where she died of her injuries. U.S. Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., told Good Morning America he was in the hallway behind the officer who shot and killed Babbitt. ""When they broke the glass in the back, the (police) lieutenant that was there, him and I already had multiple conversations prior to this, and he didn't have a choice at that time,"" Mullin said in a Jan. 7 interview. ""The mob was going to come through the door, there was a lot of members and staff that were in danger at the time. And when he (drew) his weapon, that's a decision that's very hard for anyone to make and, once you draw your weapon like that, you have to defend yourself with deadly force."" Babbitt, a 35-year-old San Diego woman, was a 14-year Air Force veteran who served four tours as a high-level security official, KUSI-TV in San Diego reported. Her husband told the station she was an avid Trump supporter. Babbitt also backed the violent QAnon conspiracy theory, with 21 tweets referencing that slogan since February 2020, according to the Daily Beast. The site reported that Babbitt posted Jan. 5 that the United States would soon see ""The Storm,"" a day of reckoning the conspiracy theorists believed was coming for deep-state pedophiles, sex traffickers and Trump opponents. Brostoff said his claim was based on watching witness video that showed a non-uniformed officer shooting Babbitt.  But he’s wrong. A statement by Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund said Babbitt was shot by a sworn Capitol Police officer who has been placed on administrative leave in line with agency policy. That’s in line with the description from Mullin, who witnessed the shooting and talked to the officer involved. In light of that information, Brostoff said he ""may well have been misinformed"" and deleted his tweet. Brostoff claimed a Secret Service agent was responsible for the lone shooting death in the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. But he now acknowledges that was incorrect. Law enforcement confirmed later that day a Capitol Police officer pulled the trigger.

No, the storming of the Capitol wasn’t a false flag
","Supporters of President Donald Trump stormed and occupied the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.

Quotes by 4 Democrats twisted to make it look like they endorsed riots
","After pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, some have taken to social media to criticize liberals who have condemned the breach, calling them hypocrites for supporting the Black Lives Matter protests over the summer. One popular Facebook post targets four Democratic women in Congress: U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Their faces are pictured in front of burning buildings. Each photo includes a quote purportedly from the lawmaker that sounds like she is encouraging unrest. The post claims these are ""direct quotes"" from when Black Lives Matter ""was BURNING down cities and killing people in the streets!""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s take it one quote at a time. Ayanna Pressley According to the post, Pressley, D-Mass., said of the Black Lives Matter protests that ""there needs to be unrest in the streets.""  Pressley did call for ""unrest in the streets"" in an Aug. 15 interview with Tiffany Cross on MSNBC’s ""AM Joy"" show. ""This is as much about public outcry and organizing and mobilizing and applying pressure so that this GOP-led Senate and these governors that continue to carry water for this administration, putting the American people in harm’s way, turning a deaf ear to the needs of our families and our communities — hold them accountable,"" she said. ""Make the phone calls, send the emails, show up,"" she added. ""You know, there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there’s unrest in our lives."" Pressley received swift backlash with critics accusing her of condoning lawlessness. Pressley said she didn’t expect that reaction.  ""There are moments in real time when you’re offering something — on a stage in a dais, in an interview — where you become aware: ‘I’m going to experience a lot of vitriol for this,’"" Pressley recalled about her comment in a Jan. 3 USA Today article. ""I have to say, for this particular moment, I had not anticipated that, because it was a framing that I have used many times before."" There was no indication Pressley necessarily meant anything other than peaceful protest.  Kamala Harris The quote attributed to Harris, that ""protesters should not let up,"" is legitimate, but she was neither referring to riots nor condoning people burning down buildings. Speaking remotely to late-show host Stephen Colbert in June 2020, Harris voiced support for the racial justice protests that were going on — but she didn’t say she wanted riots to continue.  ""This is a movement, I’m telling you, they’re not going to stop, and everyone beware, because they’re not going to stop before Election Day in November, and they’re not going to stop after Election Day,"" she said. ""And everyone should take note of that, on both levels, that they’re not going to let up, and they should not, and we should not.""  In a speech on Aug. 27, Harris said she supported peaceful protesters. ""We should not confuse them with those looting and committing acts of violence,"" she said. Maxine Waters Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., is quoted as saying: ""If you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and create a crowd and you push back on them, and you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere."" Waters’ comment came in 2018 at a Los Angeles rally after a Virginia restaurant owner refused to serve then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. It had nothing to do with the Black Lives Matter movement or riots. Waters urged attendees at the event to keep ""pushing back"" against members of the Trump administration with whom they disagreed.  ""You think we’re rallying now? You ain’t seen nothing yet,"" Waters said, according to a HuffPost report. ""Already you have members of your Cabinet that are being booed out of restaurants ... protesters taking up at their house saying ‘no peace, no sleep.’"" ""If you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them and you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere,"" she added. Her comment was met with condemnation from Republicans and distance from some Democrats. Nancy Pelosi  Pelosi’s alleged riot quote — ""I just don’t know why there aren’t uprisings all over the country. Maybe there will be"" — was said over two years ago about the Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.  On June 14, 2018, Pelosi said that the National Association of Evangelicals told Congress that the U.S. refugee resettlement system was the ""crown jewel of American humanitarianism."" ""And in order to do away with that crown jewel, they're doing away with children being with their moms,"" she said. ""I just don't even know why there aren't uprisings all over the country. And maybe there will be, when people realize that this is a policy that they defend."" A Facebook post features statements made by four Democratic leaders and claims the comments are all direct quotes that were made ""when BLM was BURNING down cities and killing people in the streets!"" This is misleading. Some of the quotes are legitimate, and were made during or around the height of the Black Lives Matter protests over the summer.  Some of the statements received backlash, but none specifically indicated that they meant anything besides peaceful protest. Harris, in particular, condemned violent rioters and said she supported peaceful protesters.  Other comments were made years ago and were not referring to any looting or violent civil unrest that occurred during riots in 2020.  The Facebook post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Mo Brooks pushes baseless claim that antifa orchestrated Capitol riots
","Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., asked people not to ""rush judgment"" on who was behind the riots at the U.S. Capitol on the day Congress convened to affirm President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory. ""Please, don’t be like #FakeNewsMedia, don’t rush to judgment on assault on Capitol. Wait for investigation. All may not be (and likely is not) what appears. Evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack with clever mob control tactics,"" Brooks tweeted Jan. 7. Law enforcement officials are investigating the chaos and violence that transpired Jan. 6 when a mob stormed the federal building and forced Vice President Mike Pence and lawmakers to evacuate their chambers. Antifa is short for anti-fascist; the term is often used to describe a loose collection of activists who rally against fascism and far-right groups. We reviewed videos, photos, news reports and social media posts around the siege. Our review shows that the rioters were President Donald Trump’s supporters. The evidence that the rioters were part of ""antifa,"" or that the assault was organized by that coalition, is weak. The claim is being made by supporters of Trump in an effort to distance themselves from the lawlessness at the capitol. Before the mob breached the Capitol Jan. 6, Trump greeted supporters at a rally and repeated many baseless claims of election fraud.  He told the crowd: ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard."" But other parts of his remarks had a different tone. ""You'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing,"" Trump said. Photos show people inside the Capitol waving Trump flags and Confederate flags, donning sweaters, sweatshirts, beanies, red hats, green hats and other garments that said ""Trump"" or his campaign slogans, ""Make America Great Again"" and ""Keep America Great."" Lin Wood, a Trump ally and an attorney who has filed lawsuits seeking to overturn the presidential election, tweeted a photo of a man he described as an antifa activist. But the man supports Trump and the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory; he’s shared those opinions with his own Arizona community for well over a year. He replied to Wood and told him he was wrong, that he was not antifa. (Wood’s account has been suspended.) A California Republican official also shared a picture on Twitter claiming that it showed men aligned with antifa. PolitiFact California rated her false claim Pants on Fire, noting that  journalists who track far-right extremism identified one of the men in the picture as a neo-Nazi, not an antifa supporter. Facebook posts claimed that a facial recognition firm ""confirmed antifa infiltrated the Trump rally in D.C."" But that’s not true. An attorney for the firm XRVision told PolitiFact in a statement that the company analyzed footage from the Capitol, identified several people and shared that information with law enforcement. The firm concluded that two of the men were affiliated with the Maryland Skinheads and the National Socialist Movements. ""These are two known Nazi organizations, they are not Antifa,"" the statement said. Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, urged Trump and all elected officials to condemn the violence that took place on the Capitol. His statement mentioned Trump supporters, and not people aligned with the antifa movement. ""While I have consistently condemned political violence on both sides of the aisle, specifically violence directed at law enforcement, we now see some supporters of the president using violence as a means to achieve political ends,"" Wolf said. Statements from the chief of the U.S. Capitol Police and the acting attorney general said they were investigating the riots. Their statements did not suggest that antifa supporters were involved. Brooks sent the following tweets as evidence for his claim that ""antifa orchestrated"" the riots on the Capitol: ""1. A Congressman warned me on MONDAY of a growing ANTIFA threat & advised that I sleep in my office rather than leaving Capitol complex & sleeping in my condo. I heeded that advice & have slept on office floor for 4 straight nights. ""2.

No sign of widespread voting machine problems in GOP areas in Georgia runoffs
","A few hours after the start of in-person, election-day voting in Georgia’s Jan. 5 runoffs, claims surfaced that voting machines in heavily Republican areas weren’t working. The implication: that the problems disadvantaged Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who were being challenged by Democrats Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock.  The Democrats won both races, effectively shifting control of the Senate from the GOP to the Democrats. Some of the claims appeared in an article, widely shared on Facebook, from TrendingPolitics, including an assertion that some voters said they were ""unable to cast their votes in the Georgia runoff election."" TrendingPolitics describes itself as a pro-Donald Trump website that provides conservative commentary on the news. The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claims amount to isolated instances of temporary machine breakdowns, some reported secondhand, with no evidence that ballots that presumably contained votes for Perdue and Loeffler were not counted. The article included tweets from two people who said vote-scanning machines were not working when they cast ballots in what they described as heavily Republican parts of Georgia. One man tweeted that he filled out a ballot in Newton County, Ga., which he described as heavily Republican. Ossoff and Warnock both won the county handily. The county seat of Newton is Covington, which is about 35 miles southeast of Atlanta. The man tweeted that he was told by a poll worker that the machine wasn’t working and that the ballot would be scanned after the machine was fixed. The man later tweeted that when his wife voted later, the machine was working. Philip Johnson, chairman of the Newton County elections board, said a scanner at one precinct jammed, but another scanner was used and there were no delays in scanning ballots. At another precinct, about 100 ballots had to be put in an emergency ballot box while the one scanner was repaired and the ballots were scanned after the scanner was repaired.  Another Twitter user cited in the article tweeted that the scanners ""are down""  where he cast his ballot in Sandy Springs in what he described as a heavily GOP precinct of Fulton County, where Atlanta is the county seat. He suggested that meant Democrats would be in charge of putting his ballot, with votes for Perdue and Loeffler, into the scanner. Ossoff and Warnock won the county overwhelmingly. Fulton County spokeswoman Jessica Corbitt-Dominguez said there could have been isolated instances of scanning machines not working temporarily, and of poll workers needing to feed ballots into the scanners after the scanners were fixed. Corbitt-Dominguez said this is a common method for handling small numbers of ballots that could not be scanned by voters themselves. But she said she heard of no widespread problems in any precincts. Another Twitter exchange cited in the article said ballots were being placed in boxes in Paulding County to be fed into scanners once they were repaired. The Paulding County seat is in Dallas, about 30 miles northwest of Atlanta. Perdue and Loeffler won the county overwhelmingly. Paulding County’s election director did not return a call seeking comment. But Paulding County reported that one ballot scanner stopped working and voters placed their ballots in an ""emergency ballot box"" until the scanner was replaced about 30 minutes later, when scanning resumed, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""Voting did not cease at any time and all ballots have been tabulated,"" a statement from the county said. The TrendingPolitics article also included a clip of an interview that John Fredericks, a conservative radio host in Virginia, did on the morning of Jan. 5 on Stephen Bannon’s ""War Room Pandemic"" podcast. Fredericks said multiple callers to his show said that around 10 a.m. scanning machines in three of the largest Republican precincts were not working and that poll workers told voters that once the machines were fixed, the workers would put the ballots into the machines. In the clip, Fredericks did not identify the location of precincts. He did not reply to our emails. President Trump made similar claims in a tweet shortly after noon on Jan. 5: ""Reports are coming out of the 12th Congressional District of Georgia that Dominion Machines are not working in certain Republican Strongholds for over an hour. Ballots are being left in lock boxes, hopefully they count them. Thank you Congressman @RickAllen!"" Georgia voting system implementation manager Gabriel Sterling, a Republican, responded to Trump by tweeting: ""And this issue in Columbia Co. was resolved hours ago and our office informed the public about it in real time. The votes of everyone will be protected and counted. Sorry you received old intel Mr. President."" In a statement, the Georgia secretary of state’s office said that in Columbia County outside of Augusta, parts of which are in the 12th congressional district, there were programming problems that required some votes to be cast on emergency ballots, but that the problems were resolved by 10 a.m.  Perdue and Loeffler won Columbia County overwhelmingly. There were no indications of widespread problems. Asked at a news conference on Jan. 6 if there was any evidence of fraud or irregularities, Sterling said no.  ""We’ve seen nothing widespread, we’ve seen nothing that seems real in any way, shape or form, quite honestly."" He also said: ""Nobody was complaining about lines. Nobody’s saying they were disenfranchised. Everybody who wanted to vote had the opportunity to vote and we feel very proud of that fact."" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that despite a turnout of 1.2 million voters, there were a limited number of glitches, with voters waiting in line an average of one to five minutes to cast a ballot.  Election protection lawyers reported no major problems with voting machines or extended waits at polling places, according to the New York Times. An article shared on Facebook claimed that during the Jan. 5 Georgia runoff elections voting machines didn’t work in some heavily Republican areas and that some voters were kept from casting their votes. President Trump shared similar reports about broken machines. Election officials said that while there may have been some isolated mechanical issues, the matters were resolved and there is no indication that votes were not cast as a result of those problems. Election protection lawyers, local media and Georgia’s  secretary of state all confirmed there was no indication of widespread problems.

Pictures of these men were posted on the blog Philly Antifa, which describes itself as a site ""for all things Antifascist"" centered around Philadelphia. But the blog does not identify them as Philadelphia antifa members. Rather, it connects them to the Maryland Skinheads and the National Socialist Movement. (We’ve written more about one of the men here.) The third person XRVision identified was ""an actor with some QAnon promotion history,"" XRVision said. ""Again, no Antifa identification was made for him either.""  We’ve already debunked a claim that this person was an ""Antifa thug."" You can read that fact-check here. XRVision said in its statement that its lawyer had told the publication to retract the claims in its story and publish an apology. We reached out to the Washington Times about the statement and did not immediately receive a reply.

How many West Virginians would lose coverage if lawsuit against ACA prevails?
","In his campaign to unseat West Virginia’s Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, Democratic nominee Sam Brown Petsonk has argued that his opponent is risking the health insurance of hundreds of thousands of West Virginians. ""Even after a global health pandemic that has killed hundreds of West Virginians, Patrick Morrisey is doubling down on his lawsuit that would eliminate health care for over 800,000 West Virginians. Sign the petition now and tell Morrisey — DROP IT,"" Petsonk tweeted Sept. 14. Even after a global health pandemic that has killed hundreds of West Virginians, Patrick Morrisey is doubling down on his lawsuit that would eliminate healthcare for over 800,000 West Virginians. Sign the petition now and tell Morrisey – DROP IT. https://t.co/Dr0QwyYMF2 pic.twitter.com/ssW63v1fgk The lawsuit in question is California v. Texas, which challenges the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. That law, among other things, prevents insurance companies from rejecting or charging higher rates to people with pre-existing conditions. The Supreme Court is to hear oral arguments in the case soon after the election, on Nov. 10.  The lawsuit argues that the elimination of a mandate that required most people to have some level of health insurance or face a penalty tax makes the entire law unconstitutional. Twenty states have joined the lawsuit, including West Virginia.  Morrisey, as attorney general, signed the lawsuit on behalf of the state. His campaign told PolitiFact in 2018 that he does not intend to leave people uninsured, calling instead for coverage to be reinstated within the Affordable Care Act’s successor. However, President Donald Trump and other Republicans have not yet offered a plan to do so. Defenders of the law, like Petsonk, warn that overturning the law could make it hard for Americans to secure health coverage.  So is Petsonk correct that a ruling supporting the plaintiffs ""would eliminate health care for over 800,000 West Virginians""? It’s not that straightforward. As PolitiFact has reported, experts have produced varying estimates of the potential number of Americans with pre-existing conditions. The analysis that comes closest to the 800,000 figure Petsonk cited is by the liberal Center for American Progress, which published its report in March 2020. The group estimated that 716,400 residents of West Virginia have pre-existing conditions. (The analysis excluded Americans over 65, since they receive health coverage under Medicare and their ability to secure coverage would not be affected if the law is struck down.) This is a bit lower than 800,000. However, the bigger caveat is that the group didn’t say that this many people in West Virginia would see their health insurance eliminated, which was the word Petsonk used in his tweet. Instead, a plaintiff’s victory at the Supreme Court, the group said, means people with pre-existing conditions ""could face higher premiums, face benefit exclusions, or be denied coverage altogether … if they ever needed to turn to the individual market for coverage."" In other words, some of these West Virginians could be forced to pay more or see certain conditions excluded from coverage. These are negative outcomes, but they fall short of having their coverage eliminated. So how many people could see their coverage go away entirely? The Center for American Progress report pegged that number at 162,000, a substantially lower number. Another estimate has been published by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health policy and research group. Kaiser has estimated that there are 382,000 West Virginians under 65 who have pre-existing conditions that could be serious enough to risk a decline in coverage. That’s a large number, but it’s less than half of the number Petsonk cited Morrisey did not respond to inquiries for this article. Petsonk said the lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act ""would eliminate healthcare for over 800,000 West Virginians."" That figure comes close to the 716,400 figure cited in an analysis by a liberal group that opposes the lawsuit. But that analysis didn’t only address people at risk of losing their coverage entirely, but also people who could see higher premiums or restrictions on what conditions are covered. Two studies found that between 162,000 and 382,000 West Virginians could lose their health coverage if the law is struck down. And It’s also not a guarantee that all those people will lose their health care even if the law is overturned.

No, Biden did not call Black youth ‘super predators’
","As he courts Black voters days before Election Day, President Donald Trump repeated his false claim that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden called Black people ""superpredators."" ""Joe Biden called Black Youth SUPER PREDATORS. They will NEVER like him, or vote for him. They are voting for ‘TRUMP’,"" Trump tweeted Nov. 1 around 8 a.m. Trump followed-up with a similar tweet a few hours later: ""Joe Biden constantly used the term ""Super Predator"" when referring to young Black Men, according to my sources."" Trump also claimed this on the debate stage with Biden in September. Despite his repeated assertions, Trump’s claims lack evidence. When Trump said this in September, his campaign pointed to a Trump campaign video that compiled clips of Biden saying the word ""predators."" But none of those clips show Biden specifically calling Black people ""predators"" or ""superpredators."" Trump’s campaign did not respond to our Nov. 1 query. As a senator in 1993, Biden supported a criminal justice bill that eventually became known as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. (Whether the bill led to mass incarceration was debated during the Democratic presidential primary.) In a Nov. 18, 1993, Senate floor speech pushing for the bill, Biden spoke about doing something for young people who did not have supervision or structure and who did not have opportunities. He said the country needed to focus on them, because otherwise, a portion of them would ""become the predators 15 years from now."" The context of what Biden said shows that he was talking about people hypothetically becoming predators, and it shows he did not single out Blacks, African Americans, or any other racial or ethnic group. Here’s a link to a video of Biden speaking in 1993 and below is the transcript of his speech, according to the Congressional Record: ""We must take back the streets. It doesn’t matter whether or not the person that is accosting your son or daughter or my son or daughter, my wife, your husband, my mother, your parents, it doesn’t matter whether or not they were deprived as a youth; it doesn’t matter whether or not they had no background that enabled them to become socialized into the fabric of society; it doesn’t matter whether or not they are the victims of society. The end result is that they are about to knock my mother on the head with a lead pipe, shoot my sister, beat up my wife, take on my sons. So I do not want to ask what made them do this. They must be taken off of the street. That is No.1. There is a consensus on that. … ""There is a second thing that we all have agreed upon. And that is, unless we do something about the cadre of young people — tens of thousands of them, born out of wedlock, without parents, without supervision, without any structure, without any conscience developing because they literally, I yield myself three more minutes, have not been socialized, they literally have not had an opportunity. ""We should focus on them now, not out of a liberal instinct for love, brother, and humanity although I think that is a good instinct, but for simple, pragmatic reasons. If we don’t, they will — or a portion of them will — become the predators 15 years from now. Madam President, we have predators on our streets, that society has in fact, in part because of its neglect, created."" In a 1998 speech at an attorneys general conference, Biden also used the term ""predators."" He did not say he was talking about Black people. The term ""superpredators"" came up during the 2016 presidential race between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Then-GOP chairman Reince Priebus claimed that Clinton once referred to African American youth as ""superpredators."" We found that Clinton in a 1996 speech used the term ""superpredators"" when talking about the 1994 crime bill. Although she did not directly call African Americans superpredators in that speech, in 2016 she apologized for her word choice. Trump said, ""Biden called Black youth super predators."" This is inaccurate. Biden in a 1993 speech said that a portion of young people who lacked superpervision, structure and opportunities could become ""predators."" The context of Biden’s speech shows he was not specifically talking about Black people or any other specific group of people.

Is Illinois ‘nation-leading’ in funding Census outreach?
","Illinois stands to lose tens of millions in federal money over the next decade if it undercounts its citizens on the 2020 Census effort. That’s why Illinois and other states across the nation are collectively spending hundreds of millions of dollars to make sure every eligible citizen is counted. In an Oct. 13 tweet, Gov. J.B. Pritzker suggested Illinois leads the nation in that effort. ""Earlier today, my administration announced an additional $1M (million) in funding for Census outreach, on top of our historic & nation-leading $29M (million) investment,"" Pritzker tweeted. Given that other, larger states share the same incentive for an accurate count, we decided to check out the claim. The National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks Census spending by state, publishes data showing Illinois ranks second among states in total spending at $31.5 million, below California at $187 million. The NCSL previously had New York above Illinois as well, at $60 million, but has since revised it down to $20 million. When asked why the governor said Illinois is ""nation-leading,"" his top spokeswoman, Jordan Abudayyeh, said her boss’s tweet was referring not to total spending, but to spending per citizen, or per capita. By that measure, Illinois’ $2.40 per person in Census spending ranks third in the nation, behind New Mexico at $5.50 per person and California at $4.70 per person, based on NCSL’s state spending figures and 2019 U.S. Census population estimates. Abudayyeh said the top-three ranking suffices to call Illinois ""nation leading."" ""Illinois is in the top three of states, so we are ‘nation-leading’ in that regard,"" she said. In the past, Pritzker’s statements about Illinois’ supremacy in Census spending have at times been less ambiguous. In a Dec. 4 statement, he left little doubt he thought Illinois ranked number one — a claim that has never been true. ""We have committed $29 million, as was mentioned earlier, to prepare and execute the Census,"" Pritzker announced. ""And that is by far, in the United States, the most on a per capita basis that’s being spent in any state."" When the governor made that announcement, California topped the list, according to a report by The Associated Press published a week earlier on Nov. 23. Several months later, New Mexico catapulted to the top of the per-capita spending list with an additional appropriation of $8 million.  Denice Ross, a senior fellow at the National Conference on Citizenship who worked for more data transparency on the Census, said that while the term ""nation-leading"" is not precise, it is fair given Illinois’ level of spending compared to almost all other states. ""‘On top of our historic and top-three among states $29 million investment’ would be technically more accurate,"" Ross said. ""Twitter of course makes it awkward."" Pritzker said, ""Earlier today, my administration announced an additional $1M in funding for Census outreach, on top of our historic & nation-leading $29M investment."" While Illinois did not spend the most on Census outreach, it did rank in the top three among all other states. We rate Pritzker’s claim as Mostly True.

Donald Trump’s false claim that doctors inflate COVID-19 deaths to make more money
","A few weeks ago, President Donald Trump had praise for doctors on the frontlines of treating coronavirus patients. ""Since the plague arrived from China, we have seen our doctors, nurses, first responders, scientists, and researchers at their very best,"" he said Sept. 24. Trump has changed his tune. In his recent rallies, with COVID-19 cases skyrocketing and deaths climbing, he has taken to accusing physicians of inflating deaths to line their pockets. ""Our doctors get more money if somebody dies from COVID,"" he told supporters at a rally in Waterford, Mich., Oct. 30. ""You know that, right? I mean, our doctors are very smart people. So what they do is they say, ‘I'm sorry, but, you know, everybody dies of COVID.’""   This is a persistent theory that lacks any proof. Johns Hopkins University researchers reported that the virus has killed more than 230,000 people. There is no evidence that figure is exaggerated. If anything, public health analysts say it likely undercounts the reach of the disease. And while the government offers 20% more for the care of Medicare patients with COVID-19, the majority of doctors work for hospital systems. That means whatever higher payments might come, they don't go to them. In order for Trump’s claim to have an appreciable impact on reported deaths, thousands of doctors would need to lie on death certificates without any financial benefit. We recently rated False a similar claim from Trump that focused on hospitals. Trump’s words imply that death certificates are subject to the whim of physicians. That’s wrong, and here’s why. Ashish K. Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health, noted there are legal sanctions for falsifying death records. ""Doctors aren't taking random deaths and calling them COVID deaths,"" Jha wrote Oct. 27 in the website MedScape. ""That would be fraud."" Jha also dismissed the impact of additional payments. He gave the example of a patient who spends more than four days on a ventilator. ""Without COVID, Medicare pays about $35,000 for that patient's care,"" Jha wrote. ""With COVID, about $40,000."" In a tweet, Jha noted that to get this bump, the hospital must prove that the patient tested positive for COVID-19. So what happened in COVID era?Cares Act gives hospitals a 20% bump (to about $9600 – 13K) if pneumonia is from COVIDAdditional $1600 - $2200 for a typical COVID pneumonia patientTo get this bump, hospitals must document that patient is COVID positive3/n For the first time ever, in 2018, the number of doctors working for hospitals exceeded those who worked in independent practices. This means that the additional payments Trump referenced don’t apply to most doctors. A COVID-19 diagnosis doesn’t change what they charge. ""Hospitals are paid that way, not doctors,"" said Maggie McGillick, spokeswoman for the American College of Emergency Physicians. ""Doctors are typically paid based on the service they deliver."" The majority of deaths take place in hospitals and nursing homes. Trump’s statement would mean that doctors who stand to make no financial gain would put themselves at legal risk by falsifying a death record. Decisions on how to classify a given death are made by local doctors or coroners, but they are based on World Health Organization guidelines followed by the U.S. and nearly every other country.  The approach to identifying an underlying cause is laid out by the World Health Organization, which says a ""death due to COVID-19 is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma)."" The CDC reported that as of early October, the U.S. had about 300,000 more deaths in 2020 than would be expected in a typical year, two-thirds of which can be attributed directly to COVID-19. The data snapshot was based on Oct. 3 figures. That would put the death toll at 200,000, which was very close to the number reported by another regular source, the COVID Tracking Project. But the CDC went further. ""As of Oct. 15, 216,025 deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in the United States,"" the report said. ""However, this number might underestimate the total impact of the pandemic on mortality.""  This is consistent with other studies that show no overcount of deaths from the virus. Individually and collectively, doctors have rejected Trump’s claim. Philadelphia physician Dr. Priya Mammen tweeted that many frontline workers are buying their own personal protective equipment because hospitals don’t have enough. Mammen said many of her colleagues are ""exhausted by saving lives of preventable COVID."" The American College of Emergency Physicians said Trump’s implication that doctors seek to gain financially is ""offensive."" ""Emergency physicians and other health care workers have risked their lives day in and day out for almost a year battling the greatest public health crisis in a generation — all while watching countless patients die alone, going to work without sufficient protection equipment, and struggling with crushing anxiety about getting sick or spreading the virus to their loved ones,"" the group said Oct. 25. We reached out to the Trump campaign for evidence that doctors are inflating the death figures. We did not hear back. Trump said that doctors inflate the number of COVID-19 deaths to ""get more money. ... So what they do is they say, ‘I'm sorry, but, you know, everybody dies of COVID.’""   There is no evidence to back this up. Doctors and coroners follow established guidelines on the cause of death, and false reporting is a crime. A plurality of doctors work for hospitals and have no financial incentive to falsify death records. Medicare does pay more for COVID-19 patients, but hospitals must prove a positive diagnosis for the disease.  A CDC analysis, in line with other research, finds the reported deaths from COVID-19 likely underestimate deaths from the virus. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2020/nov/01/donald-trump/donald-trumps-false-claim-doctors-inflate-covid-19/

Green New Deal would not require 99% of homes to be torn down and rebuilt
","When introduced in early 2019, the Green New Deal resolution immediately sparked conversation and intense criticism, some of it stemming from mistakes made by its sponsor during the rollout.  An FAQ distributed to the media by staff for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., one of the Green New Deal sponsors, included language and policies not found in the resolution. The original version of the FAQ, which was quickly retracted, included a goal that continues to attract attention: ""Upgrade or replace every building in U.S. for state-of-art energy efficiency"" over a 10-year-period.   Close to two years later, social media users continue to refer to that now-retracted sentence about replacing buildings. One Instagram post says, ""The Green New Deal would require that 99% of homes in the country be torn down and rebuilt more ‘energy efficient’ over a ten year period."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The original FAQ distributed by Ocasio-Cortez’s staff included references to ""farting cows"" contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and the need to guarantee economic security for those ""unwilling to work,"" which were not included in the resolution.  According to the Washington Post, more than a dozen media outlets reported on policies that were listed in the retracted FAQ but not included in the legislation.. Just this month, President Trump falsely claimed that as part of the Green New Deal, ""They literally want to take buildings down and rebuild them with tiny little windows,"" according to The Hill.   The final version of Ocasio-Cortez’s FAQ removed the language about ""upgrading or replacing every building"" and instead said one of the goals is, ""upgrading virtually every home and building for energy efficiency."" That could be accomplished by replacing items such as windows, doors and insulation, as well as electricity and plumbing systems, according to Curbed. The plan would be for the federal government to provide incentives for homeowners to make those improvements. The think tank that is helping to develop the Green New Deal acknowledges that making those types of changes to some homes, particularly older ones, could expose bigger structural or safety problems, according to Fast Company. The think tank says it is studying those issues and policies that could address them. The Green New Deal is a nonbinding resolution that cannot become law in its current form.  An Instagram post says, ""The Green New Deal would require that 99% of homes in the country be torn down and rebuilt more ‘energy efficient’ over a ten year period.""  An FAQ about the Green New Deal that was later retracted included a goal of upgrading or replacing every building in the U.S. for energy efficiency within 10 years.

Yes, Joe Biden has released 22 years of tax returns online
","In a Halloween-day pitch to voters in Flint, Mich., former Vice President Joe Biden slammed President Donald Trump over the New York Times’ reporting on his long-concealed tax returns, which revealed that Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes in both 2017 and 2016. ""Why should you pay more in taxes than Donald Trump?"" Biden said at the event with former President Barack Obama. ""He paid $750 in taxes the one year we know of. He’s yet to release. I’ve released 22 years of my tax returns. You can go online and look. He hasn’t released one.""   ""He talks about corruption,"" Biden continued. ""What is he hiding?"" The Democratic presidential nominee’s 22-years claim is accurate. He has made it before, including ahead of the first presidential debate, when he made public his 2019 tax returns.  The American people deserve transparency from their leaders, it's why as of today, I've released 22 years of my tax returns. https://t.co/6fwL20fWeI The Biden campaign website lists Biden’s federal and state tax returns for 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016. It also lists Biden’s financial disclosure documents for 2020 and 2019 and the 2019 tax returns for his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, and her husband. The returns show Biden and his wife, Jill, paid nearly $288,000 in federal income taxes in 2019. RELATED: Biden’s income sources aren’t such a big mystery Biden’s tax returns for the previous eight years, covering the rest of his two terms as Obama’s vice president, can be found in archived press releases from the Obama White House. Those included tax returns released for 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, and 2008.  Asked for the remaining 10 years’ worth of filings, the Biden campaign pointed to an archived Q&A from Obama’s 2008 campaign website, which linked to many years of Biden’s tax returns from his decades-long stint as a U.S. senator representing Delaware. The page included tax returns from 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999, and 1998.  The 22 years of Biden tax returns are also available as part of an archive maintained by Tax Notes. Trump has not released his tax returns, breaking a promise he made during his 2016 campaign. According to the New York Times, the former real estate mogul and reality TV star has vowed for nearly a decade to release his tax returns under different conditions, but he hasn’t delivered. Trump is the only president or major-party presidential nominee in decades to keep his returns hidden from the public. Efforts by Congress and others to get hold of them have so far been unsuccessful. Trump has cited a pending Internal Revenue Service audit as reason for not publishing his tax returns. The IRS, however, has said nothing precludes a president from releasing tax returns while under audit — as President Richard Nixon did. Trump has also claimed, falsely, that his financial disclosures offer a more extensive picture of his finances.  In recent years, the New York Times has obtained tax records and pieced together a more complete picture of Trump’s tax history. In September, the Times reported that Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes in both 2017 and 2016, and none at all in several years before that.  Trump has provided no evidence to suggest that he’s paid more in taxes than the Times found. Tax experts said the complex tax history depicted by the Times report shows unusually aggressive tax avoidance and exceptionally persistent losses.  The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Biden said, ""I’ve released 22 years of my tax returns. You can go online and look. (Donald Trump) hasn’t released one."" Biden’s federal tax returns from 2019 dating back to 1998 are available online, as he claimed. The most recent returns are highlighted on his campaign website. Others can be found on the websites for the Obama White House and the 2008 Obama presidential campaign. Trump has not publicly released his tax returns, making him the only president or major-party presidential nominee in decades who has not done so.  We rate Biden’s claim True.

The Week reported in January that Nigeria has the lowest age of consent in the world: 11 years old.  Back in 1890, the age of consent in the United States was 12 or younger in 38 states, the Smithsonian recently explained in a story on efforts over the years to raise the age of consent. In Delaware, it was 7.  ""Men accused of raping girls as young as 7 could (and did) simply say ‘she consented’ to avoid prosecution,"" the story says.  Women later lobbied to raise the age of consent, believing it would better hold men accountable for their actions, among other benefits. All states now set the age of consent between 16 and 18. The article, published in August, makes no mention of an effort to lower that age to 4.  In 2018, the BJPsych Bulletin, a British medical journal, published an article that makes the case that lowering the age of consent from 16 to 15 or 14 in the United Kingdom would decriminalize ""a large number of ‘underage’ young people engaging in sexual intercourse."" It did not entertain the idea of lowering the age of consent to 4. We rate this Facebook post False.
