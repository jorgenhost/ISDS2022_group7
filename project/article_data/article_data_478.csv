Florida environmental group hits LeMieux for 'Big Oil' vote
","In late June 2010, the Florida Conservation Alliance -- an affiliate of the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group -- bought what it called a ""substantial"" amount of television time in the Tampa Bay area to run an ad critical of Sen. George LeMieux, R-Fla.

Here's the narration: ""It’s the worst oil disaster in American history, and Floridians are bracing for the consequences. But at a time when we need leaders who will fight for Florida’s economy and environment, Sen. George LeMieux voted to let oil companies off the hook and overturn pollution rules. Senator, when you fight to protect our coasts, we’re with you. But when you stand with Big Oil, you let us down. Call Senator LeMieux. Tell him not to disappoint us again, and to support a strong, clean energy future.""

The visuals were almost exclusively tied to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico -- oil gushing underwater, soiled beaches, petroleum-soaked birds, the flaming Deepwater Horizon oil rig.

In this sense, the ad reminded us of one we rated recently that had been placed in several media markets by Americans United for Change, a liberal advocacy group. In both ads, the focus on the oil spill -- in both the narration and the visuals -- suggested to us that reasonable people would assume that the vote ""to let big oil off the hook"" would have something to do with the spill itself, such as a vote to limit BP's liability for paying damages.

In reality, both ads refer to a different measure in Congress -- one that has nothing directly to do with the oil spill itself.

The vote cited in an on-screen footnote was on a procedural motion to take up a joint resolution sponsored by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. This measure would disapprove a rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency that classified greenhouse gasses as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. That classification would allow the EPA to act to curb emissions by big polluters that could be causing global warming.

The resolution was the latest salvo in a fight between industry and environmentalists over curbing emissions. The EPA effort, blocked during the administration of George W. Bush, was revived after Barack Obama became president. The vote was seen as a key preliminary decision in advance of possible Senate consideration of a ""cap-and-trade"" emissions bill -- a major bone of contention between the parties.

Major oil companies could be at a competitive disadvantage if the EPA acts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, since burning oil and other fossil fuels produces a lot of carbon dioxide.

It's worth noting that the resolution failed, 47 to 53, so the Senate never really wiped out what the group terms ""protections that hold polluters accountable."" But there's little question that the vote was important. ""If ever there was a vote to find out whose side you are on, this is it,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

But was it related to the oil spill? Not really. And to us, that makes it an example of an ad that isn't wrong, but is misleading.

The ad says nothing about the specific topic of the vote at issue -- be it greenhouse gasses, emissions, or global warming -- but it does mention the oil spill several times in the narration. And almost all of the imagery highlights the spill. To us, the ad's strong implication is that the vote had something to do with law or policy relating directly to the spill.

In our earlier ruling, we gave the Americans United for Change ad a Half True, arguing that it overplayed its hand on the oil spill to such a degree that it risked misleading viewers about the nature of the vote being criticized. While the ad by the Florida Conservation Alliance uses somewhat different language, the message strikes us as essentially the same. We rate this ad Half True as well.",/factchecks/2010/jun/25/florida-conservation-alliance/florida-environmental-group-hits-lemieux-big-oil-v/

Sen. Whitehouse says Democrats controlled Congress at end of Clinton presidency
","With polls showing Americans becoming increasingly concerned about the debt, Democrats have been trying to blame President George W. Bush and Republicans for fiscal decisions of the past decade. But in some cases, the Democrats have gotten their facts wrong. In a speech on the Senate floor on June 24, 2010, Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island criticized the Bush Administration for squandering a federal surplus.""When George Bush took office, President Clinton, a Democrat, and the Democratic Congress at the time had left an annual budget that was in surplus,"" Whitehouse said. ""It was returning more money to the federal government than we were spending. It was an annual budget in surplus. We had a national debt at the time, but with the annual budget in surplus, our Congressional Budget Office — the nonpartisan, not Republican, not Democratic, professional Congressional Budget Office — had estimated that, when George Bush took office, we would be a debt-free nation by 2009. We would be a debt-free nation by 2009. That was the trajectory that Democratic President Bill Clinton and the Democratic Congress left, along with those annual budget surpluses, when George Bush and the Republicans took office.""We won't delve into the varying degrees of blame that Clinton and Bush deserve for the current deficit and debt in this item. But when Whitehouse says that ""Clinton, a Democrat, and the Democratic Congress at the time had left an annual budget that was in surplus,"" he's wrong.When Clinton handed over the reins to Bush, there was a Republican Congress, not a Democratic one. In fact, it wasn't even a close call: For the last six years of Clinton's term, the GOP had been in control of both the House and the Senate.We'll note that on the numbers, rather than the party labels, Whitehouse is correct. In 2000, Clinton's final year in office, the federal government ran a surplus of $236 billion. The following year, Bush's first as president, the surplus was $128 billion. That was the last time the government ran a surplus, at least as of now. In early 2001, the CBO did indeed predict surpluses as far as the eye could see -- enough to eliminate the debt by 2009, as Whitehouse said.When we contacted Whitehouse's office, a spokesman acknowledged that the statement could have been articulated more clearly, but added that the senator was referring to the 1993 Clinton budget, which was passed narrowly by a Democratic House and Senate with widespread Republican opposition. Many economists argue that this blueprint set the table for the budget surpluses of the 1990s.So we see where Whitehouse, who got elected to the Senate in 2006,  is coming from with this explanation. But when we looked at the words he spoke on the Senate floor, we decided that they did not indicate he was referring to the 1993 budget. In cases where we think someone simply misspoke inadvertently, we give them leeway. And we'll credit Whitehouse for repeating the numbers accurately. But in this case, Whitehouse said the same mistake twice -- and it was crucial to the point he was making on assigning partisan blame. Any listener not intimately familiar with budget legislation from the 1990s would be led to believe that the Democrats controlled Congress when Bush became president. So even though the mistake was inadvertent, we think it's sufficiently noteworthy to call out Whitehouse. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2010/jun/25/sheldon-whitehouse/sen-whitehouse-forgets-which-party-controlled-cong/

Liberal group's ad hypes oil spill link in Senate vote
","In June 2010, Americans United for Change, a liberal advocacy group, began airing television advertisements critical of several Republican senators who had taken campaign donations from the oil industry and voted in ways favored by the industry. Here's the full text of the narration of the ad targeting Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. (The other ads are identical except that the names and campaign donation totals are personalized to the targeted senator). ""Every day, oil continues to pour into the Gulf of Mexico, and oil money pours through the halls of Congress,"" the narrator says. ""And $426,000 of it flows right into the pocket of our senator. What's worse than taking big bucks from big oil? Wiping out protections that hold polluters accountable. Yep. Even with disaster on our coast and Iran using oil money against us, Richard Burr voted to let big oil off the hook. Sen. Burr, next time, look out for America's clean energy future, not big oil profits."" This narration is accompanied by a string of visuals, including footage of oil gushing out of the damaged BP well head, oily water washing on a beach, an oil-covered bird, an oil burn in the Gulf of Mexico, a hand-lettered ""Beach Closed"" sign, and an aerial view of vessels working on the recovery from the oil spill. Given the focus in both the narration and the visuals on the oil spill, we think that reasonable people watching the ad would assume that the vote it references -- ""to let big oil off the hook"" -- would have something to do with the spill itself, such as a vote to limit BP's liability for paying damages.

We’re talking about a pattern of behavior here.""

Linc Chafee says 53 percent of teenagers in Central Falls are getting pregnant

Well it's obvious. Fifty-three percent of the young women are getting pregnant and have to take care of a child at home.""But still. Fifty-three percent?So we contacted Chafee's campaign manager, J.R. Pagliarini, who conceded that the statistic, which Chafee has used on more than one occasion, is inaccurate.""The senator visited Central Falls late last year and was told by a social worker working for the city that the teen pregnancy rate was over 50 percent.  That individual misread page 4 of the attached November 2 press release from Kids Count that stated that 'the teen birth rate among girls ages 15-17 in Central Falls was 59.2 births per 1,000 teen girls, about three times the state rate of 19.1 per 1,000 teen girls ages 15-17.'

Caprio says R.I. jobless rate could be cut in half if small businesses hired just one worker each
","If you’ve heard Frank Caprio speak in the last few months, you’ve heard him talk about small businesses. At campaign stops and on his website, the Democratic candidate for governor loves to chat about the small businesses he’s visited, the hurdles they face and what he would do to help them if he’s elected governor. He tells the stories so frequently and consistently, reporters know his talking points by heart. Twice in 24 hours recently he repeated one of his favorites, promising voters that he would make Rhode Island’s ""35,000 small businesses"" his top priority if elected. Both times he capped that pledge with this mantra: ""If every small business in our state, on average, was able to create one new job, we would cut our unemployment rate in half and go from one of the highest in the country to one of the lowest."" That sounds easy. But is his math right? The facts on small businesses There is an ongoing debate in Rhode Island about what constitutes a small business, depending on whether you define it by the number of employees, total revenues or other factors. Caprio bases his calculations on the assumption that there are 35,000 small businesses. His campaign says it got that number from two sources. When we first asked them, they said they got that figure from the state Economic Development Corporation, which gets its data from the state Department of Labor and Training, which relied on state taxation figures to establish its fact sheet on small businesses. Several days later, a campaign spokesman said Caprio first got the number from a Cranston accountant named Anthony V. Ricci, who brought it to one of Caprio’s small business forums. Ricci told us he got to 35,000 by taking the tax filings from companies that had less than $2.5 million in sales per year (his definition of a small business)  and factoring in several other calculations. We decided to go with the official sources. The problem is that both the EDC and the DLT peg the number at 32,372, not 35,000. And that’s all businesses, not just the small ones. Remove the 67 Rhode Island companies with more than 500 employees -- a common dividing line between small and large businesses -- and you’re left with 32,305.Caprio’s campaign defends the higher figure, saying that if you factor in other types of companies such as sole proprietorships, which don’t fall under the general small business classification, the number inches up. Thirty-five thousand, they say, is a fair estimate.But that number is still questionable because 6,490 of those companies are not easy to categorize. DLT spokeswoman Laura Hart said “the vast majority” of those 6,490 are ""seasonal employers."" According to state Tax Administrator David Sullivan, that number could also include holding corporations or LLCs with no employees.The point is, since it’s hard to know how many of them are functioning companies, it’s impossible to determine whether they’re capable of adding a worker, no matter how much the economy improves, or how much help a Caprio administration could provide.The Caprio team argues that if you put enough ""wind at their back,"" those companies will add new workers. But is a holding corporation with no employees really going to hire someone new? We don’t think so. Subtracting the 6,490 questionable companies from the DLT’s original 32,305 leaves you with 25,815. Calculating the unemployment rate Still with us? Hang in there, we’re almost finished.As of June 9, when Caprio made his statement, there were 72,300 unemployed Rhode Islanders. The unemployment rate then -- it has since dropped -- was 12.5 percent. To cut that rate in half --  to 6.25 percent -- you would need to find jobs for 36,150 of them. But remember that Caprio’s claim is based on the assumption that there are 35,000 small businesses. Even if each of them adds a new worker, using the formula the state uses to calculate unemployment figures, the rate would drop to 6.43 percent, not quite cutting it in half. If you use the state’s number of small businesses, 32,305 -- which we still think is a stretch -- Caprio’s claim gets less accurate. The rate drops only to 6.9 percent. That’s a 44.8 percent decline. If you subtract those companies unlikely to add new employees, leaving 25,815 companies that might add workers, the statement is even further from the mark. In that case, the rate would fall only to 8 percent, a decrease of 36 percent. That’s a long way from a 50-percent drop. There’s one more flaw in Caprio’s logic. He is making an assumption that economists say is unrealistic -- that every new job would be filled by someone who is statistically counted as unemployed. It’s likely that some jobs would be filled by people from a separate group that economists track, those who are considered ""discouraged workers,"" who are not included in the official number of unemployed.In a state with one of the nation’s highest unemployment rates, 25,815 new jobs sounds pretty good. But not as good as Caprio’s claims. Unemployment cut in half? Not quite. So we’re calling it Half True. ",/factchecks/2010/jun/25/frank-caprio/caprio-says-ri-jobless-rate-could-be-cut-half-if-s/

Gardiner says Langevin opposed U.S.-Mexican border fence for fear someone will get hurt
","The United States may be a melting pot, but few things divide people faster than the topic of illegal immigration. Michael J. Gardiner, one of three Republicans hoping to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. James Langevin in the 2nd District, devotes a lot of space to the issue on a web page called Illegal Immigration: Costly and Unfair to Citizens, Tax payers, and Legal Residents.      In the section on ""Common sense measures to control illegal immigration and its costs,"" he has this paragraph under the category ""physical obstacles”:""James R. Langevin is opposed to fences where they could work, because he is afraid that someone will get hurt trying to go around the fence. Thus he would deprive us of the abiliity <sic> to manage immigration in an orderly way. This is not leadership. It is powerlessness and a misplaced sense of responsibility. Our Government must not be disabled frm <sic> doing its job.""So Langevin doesn't want a secure border because he's afraid someone might get hurt trying to circumvent it?We called Gardiner at his law office and asked for the source of that assertion. He sent us to a website called OnTheIssues.org, which tracks voting records on a variety of issues, and a web page called ""James Langevin on Immigration."" ""Voted NO on building a fence along the Mexican border"" is the headline for the top item of the page, a reference to House Resolution 6061, which was passed by the House on Sept. 14, 2006 and ultimately became law. It called for at least two layers of reinforced fencing along portions of the U.S.-Mexican border.Langevin, we confirmed, voted against it.But nowhere on the website does it actually say, as Gardiner does, that Langevin opposed the measure because he thought the fence might cause someone to get hurt.In fact, the web page Gardiner cites lists other reasons opponents were against the 700-mile fence, such as the fact that the resolution had no funding for a barrier expected to cost at least $7 billion, no money to maintain it, and ignores real enforcement measures such as hiring more border patrol personnel.We found other arguments against the resolution, any of which might have been Langevin's motivation to vote no.Even when OnTheIssues.org described safety concerns, it was a lot less cavalier about the argument than Gardiner. It said opponents supported voting no because ""Walls, barriers, and military patrols will only force those immigrants to utilize ever more dangerous routes and increase the number of people who die in search of an opportunity to feed and clothe their families.""Gardiner said he wrote his position paper before he realized that the arguments listed on OnTheIssues.org were not attributed to Langevin, or anyone else in particular.""I suppose I missed that the first time, in my enthusiasm to research his record,"" the candidate said. ""I can't say what he specifically said, to be fair.""In his enthusiasm, Gardiner made assumptions that have no basis. So regardless of the real reason for Langevin's vote, the Truth-O-Meter says Gardiner deserves a Pants on Fire .For the record, we asked Langevin’s office why the Congressman voted against the legislation. Spokeswoman Joy Fox responded with an email saying that Langevin is not convinced that the border fence is an answer to the problem of border security.  “He had serious concerns that the costs of the bill would not result in significant improvements to our border security. And these concerns, unfortunately, have been borne out. The border fence initiative has been beset by ineffective management, cost overruns and missed deadlines,” Fox said.

Does Georgia have more illegal immigrants than Arizona?
","(Update: The Pew Hispanic Center recently emailed PolitiFact Georgia its latest numbers on “unauthorized immigrants” that update numbers in the original report below. It does not impact our ruling since that was based on numbers from the Department of Homeland Security.  The report is entitled: “A Portrait of Unauthorized Immigrants in the United States.” It can be found at http://pewhispanic.org/reports/report.php?ReportID=107.  Pew found California had the greatest number of “unauthorized residents” and estimated that number at between 2.5 and 2.85 million. Arizona came in sixth on the Pew Hispanic Center list with between 475,000 and 550,000 unauthorized immigrant residents. Georgia came in seventh on that list with 425,000 to 500,000.)    Cracking down on illegal immigration has become a mega-mantra for Republicans who want to be Georgia’s next governor.That became evident at a June 17 Republican gubernatorial debate, sponsored by the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and the Georgia Press Association.The five Republican candidates who showed up for the GOP debate all favored Georgia adopting a get-tough measure like the one passed in Arizona. But candidate Jeff Chapman, a state senator, went further. He stated that Georgia has actually surpassed Arizona in the number of immigrant residents who broke the law to enter the United States. “Georgia having more illegal aliens than the state of Arizona is clearly taking away jobs,” Chapman said at the debate. Georgia, a state in the Deep South, has more illegal immigrants than Arizona, a state that sits on the Mexican border and is at the epicenter of the illegal immigration political storm? We at PolitiFact Georgia were dubious.Chapman made the statement not only at the debate; he repeats it in detail on his campaign Web site. On the site, Chapman states: “Officially, we have 480,000 illegal aliens in the state of Georgia. Officially, Arizona has 460,000.”Georgia is, of course, a much bigger state, population-wise,  than Arizona. It has a total population of 9.8 million residents, while Arizona has about 6.6 million residents. To check the numbers of illegal immigrants, we first went to the Pew Hispanic Center, which keeps a wide array of statistics on illegal immigration. Pew’s Web site numbers indicated California had the greatest number of illegal residents and estimated that number at between 2.5 million and 2.7 million. Arizona came in fifth on the Pew list with between 400,000 and 450,000 illegal immigrant residents. Georgia came in seventh on that list with 350,000 to 450,000.But there was a problem with the Pew numbers. They were from 2005, nearly five years old. We also checked the Web site Statemaster.com, which listed Georgia seventh with 228,000 illegal immigrants and Arizona sixth with 283,000. But those numbers turned out to be 10 years old, based on a report done in 2000.So we called a Washington-based organization known as FAIR -- Federation for American Immigration Reform. Spokesman Jack Martin said their numbers show Arizona ranks sixth with 500,000 and Georgia seventh with 495,000.But Martin said the latest numbers are kept by the Department of Homeland Security. And he recommended we contact that agency for the most updated information.That sentiment was echoed by Tom Edwards of the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census Bureau, he said, just keeps numbers on immigrants who live in the U.S., with no distinction of their legal or illegal status. If you want the most updated numbers, Edwards said, go to the Department of Homeland Security. So we did. What we found was a report titled: “Estimates of the Unauthorized Immigrant Population Residing in the United States: January 2009.” It was authored by Michael Hoefer, Nancy Rytina and Bryan C. Baker.The report said its estimate began with the American Community Survey (ACS) of the U.S. Census Bureau, which estimates the total foreign-born residents in the U.S. From that report, using various filters, the DHS estimated the number of illegal residents. It’s a bit art, a bit science. And even the report itself cautioned that estimating the number of illegal residents is a slippery business. “Annual estimates of the unauthorized immigrant population are subject to samplingerror in the ACS and considerable nonsampling error because ofuncertainty in some of the assumptions required for estimation,” the report cautioned.Still, it is a highly regarded number by those in the business of counting people. And it comes up with some interesting conclusions. “The greatest percentage increases in the unauthorized population between 2000and 2009 occurred in Georgia [115 percent], Nevada [55 percent], and Texas [54 percent],” the report noted. The DHS report still listed California in the top spot, with 2.6 million illegal immigrants. But it placed Georgia at the No. 6 spot with 480,00 illegal residents and Arizona seventh with 460,000. Interestingly, just 10 years ago, Arizona was far ahead with 330,000 illegal immigrant residents while Georgia had only 220,000.Chapman appears to have done his homework on this subject.

During the primary, Angle said Social Security ""can't be fixed""
","Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is facing a tough re-election campaign back home in Nevada. His opponent is Republican Sharron Angle, a former state legislator who also has the support of Tea Party activists.Soon after Angle secured the Republican nomination, the Reid campaign released an ad attacking her positions on Social Security and prison programs.""Social Security. It means independence, a secure income,"" the ad's narrator says. ""But shockingly, Sharron Angle wants to wipe out Social Security.""There's a brief clip of Angle saying, ""We need to phase Medicare and Social Security out.""""She'd cut benefits for everyone coming into the system,"" the narrator says. ""That's Sharron Angle. First, a Scientology plan to give massages to prisoners. Now she wants to get rid of Medicare and Social Security. What's next?""We addressed the Scientology angle in a separate report. Here, we're looking at whether Angle ""wants to wipe out Social Security.""First, we should note the ad's video of Angle is edited from a longer statement she made during a May 19 primary debate with other Republican candidates.""We need to phase Medicare and Social Security out in favor of something privatized,"" Angle said. ""We know that the government never gives ... ""At this point the moderator interrupted, saying, ""Well, don't fix it? You're saying don't do any of these things?""Angle replied, ""I'm saying it can't be fixed. It's broken.""We also asked the Reid campaign to back up the claims, and it provided us with several news accounts describing Angle as wanting to end Social Security, the government program that sends senior citizens modest monthly checks after they retire. The most on-point story was one from the Associated Press, dated June 1, 2010, that began, ""Sharron Angle wants to wipe out Social Security, shutter the Education Department and return to the days almost a century ago when the federal income tax was unconstitutional. ... ""Angle calls Social Security 'a broken system without much to recommend it.' She hasn't offered a detailed plan but says seniors now collecting benefits would not be cut off. Workers over time would be shifted to private retirement accounts, an idea that is similar to what former President George W. Bush proposed six years ago only to see it flop.""We checked Angle's campaign website and found the following about Angle's position on Social Security: ""Free market alternatives, which offer retirement choices to employees and employers, must be developed and offered to those still in their wage earning years, as the Social Security system is transitioned out. Young workers must be encouraged to investigate personal retirement account options.""Angle has been asked several times in recent weeks about her views on Social Security, especially about diverting payroll taxes that pay for the program into private investment accounts.Jon Ralston, a prominent Nevada political reporter, asked her about it on his show, Face to Face. ""Privatize social security? People will go crazy about that kind of stuff, won't they?"" Ralston asked.""You know, Jon, we all know that Social Security has been broken for years,"" Angle replied. ""The government has been raiding the lockbox and putting in IOUs. We really need to do something that says, going forward -- not right now, because we have some senior citizens that have made a contract with us, we need to be in good faith and complete our contract with them. But going forward, people that are still in the work force right now making their living, they should have a choice between giving that money to the government to take out of that lockbox or keeping the money in a lockbox of their own.""Fox News commentator Sean Hannity also asked Angle about the ad on June 14.""Look, Harry Reid is attacking you in this latest ad that he's got out there, saying that you want to phase out Medicare and Social Security. What is your reaction to what he said?"" he asked.""Well, it's nonsense. I want to save Medicare and Social Security. I'd like to put some of that money back in the lockbox that he has raided and put an IOU in. He's (had) 20 years to fix Social Security and Medicare. And what we have is an empty lockbox. And what we need is to make our senior citizens feel secure once more with their own Social Security and Medicare. But going forward we need to personalize that program in a way that the government can't go in and raid it any more.""Reading all of her public comments, we conclude that Angle supports privatizing Social Security, similar to the plan President George W. Bush put forward in 2005. Bush wanted to allow workers to divert part of the program's payroll taxes to personal investment accounts, typically invested in stocks and bonds. The idea was that private accounts would give younger workers the ability to manage their retirement nest eggs without government interference and it would keep the system solvent. Opponents said it was a sneaky way to start dismantling Social Security.But we still have questions about Angle's position on Social Security. Her comments from earlier in the campaign indicate that she thinks Social Security should eventually be ended. Her comments to Hannity and that of her spokesperson imply that private accounts might be optional, as Bush suggested. Reid's ad says Angle wants to ""wipe out Social Security"" and ""cut benefits for everyone coming into the system."" During the primary, Angle clearly indicated that she thought Social Security should be phased out, saying, ""It can't be fixed. It's broken."" Lately, her comments have been less clear, as if she is leaning toward an optional ongoing program. But that was not her position during the primary. Then, she said the program should gradually phase out. So we rate Reid's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/24/harry-reid/during-primary-angle-said-social-security-cant-be-/

Reid ad claims Angle supported a Scientology plan to give massages to prisoners
","Shortly after Sharron Angle won the Nevada Republican primary, Democratic opponent Harry Reid quickly picked up on some of the attacks levelled against Angle by her Republican primary opponent.According to a Reid ad, Angle supported ""a Scientology plan to give massages to prisoners.""As a Nevada Assemblywoman in 2003, Angle pushed for Nevada to try a controversial drug and criminal rehabilitation program based on the teachings of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. Angle mulled legislation to bring a demonstration of the program -- called Second Chance -- to women's prisons in Nevada. And she was among a group of several Nevada legislators who made plans to travel to Mexico to see the program in action. According to a Feb. 18, 2003, story in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the trip would have been paid by a private Arizona businessman with ties to the Church of Scientology.According to the Review Journal story, Angle defended the program, saying that while parts of the program were developed by Hubbard, his religion had nothing to do with the program.""I don't have any inclination toward Scientology,'' Angle said. ""But when something works, you have to take a look at it.""Angle parroted claims from the program leaders that only 10 percent of the inmates who enter the program return to drugs. But those claims are highly disputed. Nevada Assembly Majority Leader Barbara Buckley, a Democrat, said then that the program was costly and that legislators were told Mexican officials did not check on program participants after they left prison.Angle abandoned her efforts -- and canceled her planned trip to Mexico -- after she said it became clear that Democratic opposition to the program made it a non-starter.Angle's efforts on behalf of the Second Chance program first became political fodder for her Republican primary opponent Sue Lowden, who aired an ad in which the narrator says ""Retreat, relax, renew. Unwind and enjoy the soothing sauna and massage treatments in Nevada prisons."" Images of male prisoners getting back rubs flashed in the background.The Reid ad picks up on the same theme, showing a male prisoner getting a massage, but does more of a quick hit with, ""That's Sharron Angle. First, a Scientology plan to give massages to prisoners. Now she wants to get rid of Medicare and Social Security. What's next?"" We addressed the claim that Angle ""wants to wipe out Social Security"" in a separate item. Here we're looking at the claim that Angle supported ""a Scientology plan to give massages to prisoners.""We'll take this in two parts. First, is it accurate to call Second Chance a ""Scientology plan""? Church of Scientology officials have long contended that Criminon and Narconon, the parent programs of Second Chance, are secular programs unaffiliated with the Church of Scientology. According to Narconon officials, Narconon was not founded by Hubbard, but by William Benitez, who while an inmate in an Arizona prison read books by Hubbard and applied his principles in developing a drug treatment program. However, many of the techniques and courses used in the program are similar to those practiced by Scientologists, which is why many Scientology observers say that at best, the line between Scientology and programs like Criminon and Narconon are blurred.As for the claim that Second Chance was a ""plan to give massages to prisoners,"" we think that's a gross oversimplification of the program.The ad suggests the sum of the program is akin to some sort of spa experience. The program does incorporate the use of saunas as part of a purported detoxification program that mirrors a Scientology ritual called the purification rundown. The use of saunas is based on Hubbard's belief that it is possible to sweat out toxic substances and drug residues, which can cause cravings for more drugs.The program also incorporates the use of ""nerve assists."" According to an online Scientology handbook, nerve assists are used to straighten joints and the spine. According to the handbook, ""The Nerve Assist consists of gently releasing the standing waves in the nerve channels of the body, improving communication with the body and bringing the being relief."" What follows is a detailed set of instructions on how to administer a nerve assist.In a candidate debate on Face to Face with Jon Ralston on May 18, 2010, Angle said ""it wasn't actually massages, it was really more of a karate chop. And the sauna I would say was a sweat box, in there with 30 sweaty guys is not exactly a sauna.""By our reckoning, though, the method described in the Scientology handbook resembles a back massage, at least enough so that calling it that is not out of order. But there's more to the Second Chance Program than saunas and nerve assists. It also includes a series of life improvement courses, such as ones aimed at improving communication skills. News reports in the Wall Street Journal, Santa Fe Journal and the Los Angeles Times detail the workings of the program. It was used in New Mexico prisons for two years.We contacted William Miller, an addiction expert and a retired professor of psychiatry at the University of New Mexico, who reviewed Second Chance at the request of the city of Albuquerque and recommended against the city adopting and funding Second Chance. Via e-mail, Miller told us it is a ""Scientology-based program that has no scientific credibility.""And it no longer is operating in New Mexico prisons, he noted.""They consumed quite a bit of money for several years, performed poorly, and went out of business when governmental funding dried up for them,"" Miller said.We also called Angle's campaign for comment about the program and Angle's involvement. Campaign staffer Lee Adams said ""it was something she looked at and ultimately said no."" As we noted earlier, it wasn't so much that Angle decided the program didn't have merit. Rather, she made a political calculation that it didn't have enough support to pass, and so she declined to offer legislation that was DOA.For the record, Adams said, despite some rumors circulating around, Angle is not a Scientologist.""She's a Southern Baptist,"" he said.As for the claim in the Reid ad, we think it's accurate to point out Angle's one-time support for a controversial drug and crime rehabilitation program based on the teachings of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. But we think it's misleading to sum it up as back rubs for prisoners. There's a lot more to it than that. Some may find the idea of taxpayer support for the program equally as troubling, but this was more about supporting a controversial drug treatment program than one aimed at coddling criminals with massages. And so we rate the ad's claim Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/24/harry-reid/reid-ad-claims-angle-supported-scientology-plan-gi/

Vern Buchanan estimates debt growth during marathon Wimbledon match
","The mind-bogglingly long Wimbledon tennis match between John Isner of the United States and Nicolas Mahut of France finally ended on June 24, 2010, after 11 hours and 5 minutes. Isner prevailed 70-68 in the fifth set.Leave it to Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla. -- who represents a Sarasota-area district not far from Isner's Tampa home -- to turn this sports oddity into a political point.Not long after Isner finally won, Buchanan tweeted, ""Think Wimbledon tickets are expensive? Our National Debt has gone up by $1,729,000,000 during the Isner v. Mahut match.""We couldn't resist checking his math.We first decided that what Buchanan meant by ""during the Isner v. Mahut match"" was the time between the first serve on June 22, 2010, and the final point on June 24, 2010. That was roughly 48 hours, or two days.One way to look at it is to use the Congressional Budget Office's analysis of the president's budget, which was released in March. This predicts a $1.368 trillion deficit for 2010. If you divide this by 365 days, you get an incremental, daily addition to the debt of $3.748 billion. Over two days, the total is $7.496 billion. That's more than four times of Buchanan's estimate.Another way is to turn to the historical tables for federal debt published by the Office of Management and Budget. These tables list the federal debt as it stands every year on Dec. 31. We took the debt estimate for the end of 2010 ($13.787 trillion) and subtracted the debt as it stood at the end of 2009 ($11.876 trillion) to determine the amount of debt increase over the course of 2010 ($1.911 trillion).Dividing by 365, you get a daily debt increase of $5.234 billion, or $10.470 billion over two days. That's about six times more than what Buchanan had said.Why so different? We contacted Buchanan's office and an aide clarified that what they'd actually meant in the tweet was how much the debt had risen during the 11-hour, 5-minute match itself. (The match was suspended for darkness twice and there were delays on the third day to give extra rest time.)So, using our first method, the 11-hour debt increase works out to $1.718 billion, while using the second, it's about $2.4 billion. Of these two, the first is spot-on.Since the size of the federal debt is a moving target, and since economists periodically re-evaluate its size, we'll grant Buchanan leeway here. While we think the wording of his tweet suggests the full, 48-hour period, his 11-hour number strikes us as a reasonable estimate. So we rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/24/vern-buchanan/vern-buchanan-estimates-debt-growth-during-maratho/

Incumbents hard to beat
","
Underneath the loud tussling over who Florida's next governor and U.S. Senator will be runs a quiet political battle that could have far more lasting ramifications.

Two warring efforts to reshape how Florida's voter districts are drawn are gearing up across the state. On one side stands Fair Districts Florida, a citizens group that claims political leaders manipulate the redistricting process to benefit incumbents. They put two constitutional changes, Amendments 5 and 6, on the November ballot. The measures would require lawmakers to adhere to redistricting standards that don't favor incumbents when they redraw legislative and congressional lines starting next year.

On the other side are Republican lawmakers and a handful of minority leaders who argue the requirements set out in the amendments are both vague and impossible. They placed their own constitutional amendment on the ballot, Amendment 7, that would allow legislators to craft districts using ""communities of interest,"" such as race or coastal communities.

""We asked them a very simple question, 'How does your plan to draw the districts work?' And they said, 'I don't know,'"" said incoming Senate President Mike Haridopolos, R-Melbourne, a critic of the Fair Districts campaign who pushed Amendment 7 through the 2010 legislative session. ""I am not going to play politics with something as important as someone's voting rights.""

But critics of the legislative amendment paint it as a ploy to confuse voters and gut the Fair Districts amendments.

Ellen Freidin, campaign chair of Fair Districts Florida, said Florida's redistricting process deters new candidates.

""They actually designed their districts specifically for themselves,"" she said. ""They know how many registered voters in the district are Republican or Democratic so someone from the other side can't win because they stack it that way.""

The Fair Districts Florida website explains the stakes this way: ""In the last 6 years, there have been 420 elections for State Senator and State Representative. Only three incumbents have been defeated! After all, their districts are specially designed for them! With virtually certain seats, legislators have no incentive to be responsive to their constituents and they see no reason to compromise for the public good.""

We aren't going to address the finger-wagging over which side is in the wrong. But Fair Districts' election statistics are ripe for a Truth-O-Meter item. We wondered, are Florida elections really that predictable?

The short answer is yes.

We checked the state Division of Elections site, which lists every state Senate and House candidate since 1996. It also lists the outcomes of each race, including primaries, special elections, runoffs and general elections.

In the past six years, Florida has held three regularly scheduled general elections and 17 special elections for Senate and House seats. By definition, special elections don't feature incumbents, so those campaigns are not relevant to our count.

In 2008, there were 141 seats up for grabs. In 2006, there were 140, and 2004 saw 142 seats enter into play. That amounts to 423 potential general elections in six years. There are many more elections if you count individual primaries, runoffs and general elections.

Freidin said her ""420"" figure was based on the number of Senate and House seats that might have been up for election during those three cycles.

From 2004 through 2010, many Florida incumbents won re-election when candidate qualifying closed because they drew no opponents. In 2004, every incumbent won re-election.

Of the incumbents who drew rivals, exactly three were defeated during that six-year span: 
Fair Districts Florida's larger point that Florida races tend to be easy on incumbents still rang true after further scrutiny.

A review of the past six election cycles shows challengers had a slightly better chance of winning just before and right after the state's districts were redrawn in early 2002, but not by much. In that election year, four incumbents lost their seats in a race where 160 seats were initially up for grabs. In 2000, with 141 open seats, four other incumbents were defeated. In 1998, with 141 seats in play, four incumbents didn't win back their seats.

We'll do the math for you: just 15 state senators and representatives didn't win re-election bids over the span of six election cycles.

Haridopolos said incumbent victories aren't necessarily tied to redistricting. The winners could simply have run better campaigns or enjoyed higher name recognition, he said.

But our concern is the statement in question, which has to do with statistics, not cause and effect.

Fair Districts Florida got it right. We rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/24/fair-districts-florida/incumbents-hard-beat/

Tampa Bay Rays owner says team is most affordable in sports
","
When Stuart Sternberg took control of the Tampa Bay Rays, people told him that in order to improve dismal attendance at the team's games he needed to first build a winner on the field.

""People said if you win, they will come,'' Sternberg said.

2008 -- 97 wins and a trip to the World Series.

2009 -- A second consecutive winnning season (just the second in franchise history).

2010 -- The second-best record in baseball through June 22nd's games.

Yet attendance is still, well, dismal.

The Rays are averaging a little over 22,000 people a night at Tropicana Field in 2010, which places them 10th in the 14-team American League and 23rd out of 30 in Major League Baseball. Despite a winning team. Despite a popular Saturday night concert series. And despite a cheap ticket, the Rays say.

The disappointing turnstile receipts played prominently into Sternberg's announcement June 21, 2010, that the team wants to explore options for a new stadium outside St. Petersburg, specifically in Tampa and Hillsborough County. Rays officials are convinced that a new, modern ballpark constructed closer to the region's geographic center could boost attendance by 7,000 to 8,000 fans a game.

""We have learned that it's not just about winning,"" Sternberg said. ""It's not about ticket prices. And it certainly isn't about a lack of interest in this team.

""Our prices have been judged the most affordable in all of professional sports. Our television ratings have grown dramatically. And our standing in the community has never been higher. Our customers are our fans. We need to be in a location that is convenient for our fans to reach. And we need to be in a place that makes us attractive to the region's businesses and community.""

Sternberg claims the Rays have done everything to make baseball work in downtown St. Petersburg, including cutting prices to the bottom in all of professional sports.

PolitiFact Florida got a call from the bullpen to check it out.

The Rays directed us to a 2009 fan survey from ESPN Magazine called the Ultimate Standings. The survey ranks teams in each professional sport (baseball, football, hockey and basketball) in eight different categories. Scores in seven of the eight categories came from 50,000 responses to ESPN.com. An eighth category -- which tried to measure wins versus revenues -- was computed by researchers at the University of Oregon.

The results were then weighted to create an overall score. The Rays ranked 16th overall out of 122 professional sports teams.

But that's not what we're checking.

One of the individual categories was Affordability, and specifically asked fans to rate teams in terms of ticket prices, parking prices and concessions prices. According to ESPN, the Rays ranked No. 2 overall in ticket prices, No. 1 in parking prices and No. 5 in concession prices.

That made the Rays the most affordable franchise in all of professional sports, according to the ESPN survey, just like Sternberg said.

But we're not sure how much weight the ranking actually should hold.

Take parking, where the Rays ranked first. Depending on the game, it costs anywhere from $10 to $25 to park at Tropicana Field. The New York Mets -- who ranked 111th in parking prices in the survey --charge $19 for all games. The San Diego Padres -- who ranked 108th in parking -- charge less than the Rays, between $8 and $15. The NFL's Denver Broncos charge between $20 and $30 to park and rank 68th. Parking is $18 a game for the NBA's Golden State Warriors, which somehow ranks 106th. 
Now, the Rays point out that if you have four people in your car you can park for free. And we'll point out that if you live in New York, Philadelphia, Boston or Washington, you'll most likely take public transportation meaning you won't have to pay for parking either. We also feel obligated to note that the four people free parking rule only applies to Sunday games and a select other few home dates. The rest of the time, the first 100 cars with four or more will park for free up to an hour before game time. 
Trying to consider the relative cost of tickets is even more challenging. The Rays charge a different price for the same seat depending on who they are playing and what night of the week the game is on. Baseball, of course, also has a built in advantage because teams play 81 home games a year compared to half that for hockey and basketball and just eight regular-season home games for football (Fewer games means a smaller supply of seats, which translates into higher prices).

Still, for the sake of argument, let's see how much it cost to buy an outfield seat at a handful of Thursday's baseball games -- not counting those Ticketmaster fees.

Rays vs. San Diego Padres -- $17
Atlanta at Chicago White Sox -- $17
Chicago Cubs at Seattle -- $32
Pittsburgh at Texas -- $30
Florida at Baltimore -- $15
Minnesota at Milwaukee -- $30
San Francisco at Houston -- $18

Of the seven games we looked at, the Rays have the second-cheapest outfield seat available. The team that has the cheapest option, the Baltimore Orioles, ranks 61st in terms of ticket pricing, according to ESPN. And the Brewers, who rank fourth in ticket pricing, have the second-most expensive ticket. Any of that make sense?

Doesn't to us either.

And here's the point. Sternberg accurately cites an ESPN study in saying that the Rays have been ""judged the most affordable (team) in all of professional sports."" But we're not sure an ESPN survey of 50,000 fans represents a true picture of the affordability of the Rays, or any of the other 121 professional sports franchises.

There are so many variables when it comes to ticket pricing -- be it the opponent or the day of the week -- or parking, or concession prices that it's just hard to make a fair judgment. Because the survey is suspect, we rate Sternberg's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/24/stuart-sternberg/tampa-bay-rays-owner-says-team-most-affordable-spo/

Candidate: Oil spills from tankers more common than ""very rare leaks"" from rigs or pipelines
","As the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico continues to threaten the coastline, Savannah's Eric Johnson, a Republican gubernatorial candidate, remains steadfast in his support for offshore drilling. He dedicated a blog post to his position on his campaign Web page. ""Predictably, liberal activists call the Gulf disaster a warning of things to come if we expand drilling, but this incident is an unfortunate exception to the rule. The last major oil spill from a drilling accident in America happened over 40 years ago in 1969. In fact, oil spills from tankers are far more common than the very rare leaks from rigs or pipelines.""An earlier PolitiFact item ruled that Johnson's claim that the last major oil spill from a drilling accident in America took place in 1969 was False. This one deals with whether oil spills from tankers are far more common than ""very rare leaks"" from rigs or pipelines. We looked at a 2009 report produced by the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, that catalogs oil spills. Indeed, the number of spills from tankers in U.S. waters is nearly two-and-a-half times higher than those of offshore oil pipelines and oil platforms combined. Tankers also dump more than three times more oil. Two scientists who study the ocean and environment also confirmed that tankers are responsible for more spills. Here's how the numbers from the American Petroleum Institute break down:    U.S. offshore pipelines, 1969 to 2007: 506 spills, 182,355 barrels  p24    U.S. platforms, 1969 to 2007: 1,035 spills, 277,033 barrels p24    Oil tankers in U.S. waters: 3,774 spills, 1962 through 2007; 1,596,638 barrels p31U.S. Coast Guard figures on spills differ from API data but back up the overall point that tanker spills are far worse polluters than offshore oil pipelines or platforms. But are leaks from rigs or pipelines ""very rare""?  The petroleum industry's own figures indicate the U.S. has averaged more than 13 pipeline spills and 27 platform spills a year. They're certainly less common than tanker spills, as Johnson stated. But platform and pipeline spills still take place roughly 40 times annually. That's a little more than three times per month. That's not rare at all. That's chronic. We rule this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/24/eric-johnson/candidate-oil-spills-tankers-more-common-very-rare/

Sacramento Bee editorial says Texas ranks last in residents with high school diplomas
","
In an editorial poking at Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s pitch for California businesses to ogle Texas, the Sacramento Bee's editorial board said Texas ranks poorly in several ways.

The editorial says, for instance: ""Yes, come check out Texas. Check out a state that ranks dead last in the percent of its population with high school diplomas."" (Click here to read our evaluations of more Bee claims.)

Stuart Leavenworth, who edits the Bee’s editorial page, pointed us to an Aug. 22, 2011, San Francisco Chronicle news article on Perry’s record. That story draws on the Legislative Study Group, a caucus of the Texas House whose staff analyzes legislation and makes recommendations to its members, which during the 2011 session included one Republican and 48 Democrats. The story quotes the study group as saying Texas is ""dead last in the number of residents over 25 who have a high school diploma.""

Texas was last by its lonesome a few years ago, we found, but it shared the dubious ranking with California and another state in 2011, the latest year researched.

Nationally in 2011, nearly 86 percent of adults 25 or older had completed high school or the equivalent, according to results from that year’s American Community Survey, a mail survey that the U.S. Census Bureau annually sends to more than 2 million households.

Among the states, Montana led the nation, with 92.3 percent of adults clearing the high-school hurdle, according to the survey, while Texas ranked last, with 81.1 percent of its adults having completed high school.

However, the Texas rate matched the rates for Mississippi and California, according to the bureau. For both Texas and California, the bureau says, the margin of error was plus or minus 0.2 percentage points.

States with better results included Louisiana (82.5 percent); Alabama (82.7 percent); Kentucky (83.1 percent); New Mexico (83.2 percent); and Arkansas (83.8 percent), the bureau says.

We asked the Texas state demographer, Lloyd Potter, about the bureau’s figures.

By email, Potter said the survey is ""really the one standard we have for cross-state comparisons."" He pointed out, too, that the Texas tie with two states in 2011 marks an improvement from 2010, when the survey indicated Texas was tied for last with California, and from 2009, when the survey placed Texas last by itself.

Our ruling

The Bee’s editorial board said Texas ranks last in its share of residents with high school diplomas.

That’s right, though Texas lately has company. In 2011, the Lone Star state tied for last with Mississippi and California. In each state,  81.1 percent of adults 25 and older had completed high school or the equivalent, the government says.

Will Weatherford says Florida's campaign contribution limit is nation's second-lowest
","
Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford does not have kind words for the state’s $500 limit on individual campaign contributions.

He’s called the cap archaic, emasculating and ineffective, saying lawmakers bypass the $500 per election threshold by raising unlimited amounts of money from loosely regulated political committees.

Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, says increasing the limit on individual campaign contributions will make Florida’s campaign finance system more transparent.

""We have the second-lowest contribution limit in the entire country,"" Weatherford said in driving home the point to news editors and reporters in Tallahassee on Jan. 30, 2013.

Later that day, Weatherford unveiled House legislation that would increase the individual donation limit to $10,000 and get rid of the political committees that Weatherford says have been prone to abuse.

We decided to circle back to Weatherford’s comment about Florida’s lower-than-most contribution limit.

Weatherford is referring to the maximum amount a person can contribute to a candidate for state office per an election. According to the Florida Department of State, a ""person"" in campaign finance terms is defined broadly to include ""an individual or a corporation, association, firm, partnership, joint venture, joint stock company, club, organization, estate, trust, business trust, syndicate or other combination of individuals having collective capacity.""

So each ""person"" can contribute $500 for a primary and $500 for a general election, or $1,000 total. The same person can also contribute another $1,000 for a business they own. Or if they own 10 businesses, they can contribute an additional $10,000. And so on.

Weatherford spokesman Ryan Duffy directed us to a breakdown of campaign limits across states by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Duffy said Florida is actually tied for the second-lowest limit, with Maine being the state with the lowest limit ($350).

But it’s not a simple apples-to-apples comparison.

Florida’s $500 limit -- or $1,000 if you include the primary and general election -- is the same for all state races (House, Senate, Cabinet and governor), but limits in other states vary according to the race. In Connecticut, for instance, individual donations max out at $3,500 per election for gubernatorial candidates (more than Florida), $1,000 for state Senate races (the same) and $250 for state House races (and less).

Some states have different contribution limits for election years and non-election years. And instead of counting donations for each election, like Florida, some states strictly look at donation tallies per calendar year.

Point being, it’s pretty complicated. So we went to the experts.

NCSL senior fellow Jennie Bowser provided us a list of 12 states that have the same or lower contribution limits as Florida in certain situations. (Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana and Wisconsin).

A few examples, from the NCSL:

* Candidates for Legislature in Delaware can receive a total of $600 in contributions (counting the primary and general election).
* Candidates for Legislature in Montana can receive a total of $320 in contributions (counting the primary and general election).
* Candidates for Legislature in Colorado can receive a total of $400 in contributions (counting the primary and general election).

In each case, that compares to $1,000 in Florida.

Weatherford’s point would be closer to accurate if he were talking solely about contributions to a candidate for governor, Bowser said. Alaska’s limit is the same as Florida’s as long as the total amount is given in two separate contributions, each in a different calendar year. Arizona’s $872 limit is the lowest.

Our ruling
Weatherford claimed Florida’s direct campaign contribution limit is the second-lowest limit in the country.

Florida’s limit ($500 per election) is low compared to some states, though it’s not that low when you consider that people can make multiple contributions using business entities. But even still, Weatherford errs in trying to make a sweeping comparison because states don’t have an across-the-board limit.

Sandy relief spending too liberal and costly, says U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte
","
U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte sees a lot of pork in the Hurricane Sandy relief bill, which became law Jan. 28. And, to hear her tell it, there isn’t enough dough around to support it. 
  
Ayotte may have strong feelings about the spending levels included in the Sandy relief bills, but in this case, the numbers don’t always add up the way Ayotte would like.

Looking at the Homeland Security department, the FY2012 budget ($60.4 billion) is roughly equal to the Sandy total ($60.2 billion), and both the budget authority ($47.7 billion) and the actual amount spent ($47.4 billion) are less, so Ayotte is right in that regard.

But, the Energy budget tells a different story. In 2012, department officials operated on a budget authority of $22.8 billion -- less than half the Sandy total. But, they also estimated $39 billion in department outlays, and records show they ended up spending $32.5 billion. Doubled, both of those numbers exceed the Sandy spending, meaning on this part, Ayotte is off target.

Ayotte said she was referring to budget authority figures, and she's right on that count. By other measures, she's either very close or not accurate. We rate her claim Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2013/feb/08/kelly-ayotte/sandy-relief-spending-too-liberal-and-costly-says-/

Last month the Alabama Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision. Essentially, the court ruled that a guilty plea for child endangerment entered by a Colbert County mother should stand.

Amanda Kimbrough initially entered the guilty plea after her son Timmy died 19 minutes after birth at 25 weeks in April 2008. A medical examiner determined that Timmy died from ""acute methamphetamine intoxication."" After Kimbrough pleaded guilty to charges under Alabama’s chemical endangerment of a child statute, she received the minimum sentence of 10 years. Kimbrough later appealed, saying the chemical endangerment statute did not extend to unborn children.

The Alabama ruling included acknowledgment of unborn children in the state’s chemical endangerment statute. Anti-abortion advocates immediately praised the decision as a victory for ""personhood rights of preborn children.""

""This is the first time since Roe (v. Wade) was decided in 1973 that a court has granted personhood status to the preborn,"" Dan Becker, the president of Georgia Right to Life, said in a news release a few days after the Jan. 11 ruling. ""I am greatly encouraged that Georgia, which has proven to be pro-life, will now grant the same protection to our innocent children.""

The personhood issue -- defining human life with full rights at the point of conception instead of birth -- has had a long history in this country’s abortion debate. Abortion opponents in several states have pursued personhood efforts since the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion case.

So, we wondered: Could the Alabama ruling be a precedent as Becker said?

Kimbrough, the Alabama mother, admitted smoking methamphetamine three days before her child was born, according to media reports. Alabama’s chemical endangerment code prohibits a ""responsible person"" from ""exposing a child to an environment in which (the person) … knowingly, recklessly, or intentionally causes or permits a child to be exposed to, to ingest or inhale, or to have contact with a controlled substance, chemical substance, or drug paraphernalia."" In the case of a child’s death due to these circumstances, the result is a Class A felony with a minimum prison term of 10 years.

A Georgia Right to Life spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia that the organization was not aware of a similar court ruling prior to the Alabama case. ""The tide is turning. More and more people are rejecting the culture of death that has existed for far too long,"" spokeswoman Suzanne Ward said in an email.

Personhood USA, a Denver-based organization that opposes abortion, supported Becker’s claim.

""The only personhood effort state-by-state (Virginia and Mississippi, for example)  that has been done is through Personhood USA, and we haven’t gotten anything to pass yet. So right now there are no personhood laws on the books in any state,"" said Jennifer Mason, Personhood’s communications director.

The Alabama decision centered on a chemical endangerment statute. But the court ""said women should not take these drugs knowing that they could endanger the child. So it was both a chemical endangerment decision, but also an affirmation of personhood rights for those babies as well,"" Mason said.

PolitiFact Georgia put the claim to B. Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Law School. Hill disagreed with Becker’s statement and cited several other cases, including some cited in the Alabama ruling, in which courts have granted personhood status to the preborn. Among them, a 1997 criminal child neglect case in South Carolina involving an expectant mother sentenced to eight years in prison after her child was born with the drug in its system.

""It’s not that uncommon (among courts),"" Hill said. ""Various states have said a fetus could be a child under specific statutes, like criminal child neglect, wrongful death or, in the Alabama case, chemical endangerment.""

Steve Crampton, general counsel for Liberty Counsel, which has partnered with Personhood USA on litigation and has worked with Georgia Right to Life, said the Alabama decision ""has great potential application"" outside the chemical endangerment statute.

What happens next with the Alabama ruling is unknown, said Paul Horwitz, a constitutional law professor at the University of Alabama. ""I just don’t think it’s a question of a court using the word ‘personhood.’ It’s a question of whether or not there is a right to an abortion and when,"" he said. ""I don’t see that larger constitutional issue as something that is automatically teed up in a useful way because of this court’s ruling.""

So was Georgia Right to Life President Dan Becker correct in saying that an Alabama Supreme Court case last month was ""the first time since Roe was decided in 1973 that a court has granted personhood status to the preborn""? Not really.

There have been other cases in other states in the 40 years since Roe v. Wade in which courts have decided that a fetus could be a child. Those cases dealt with specific statutes, including criminal child neglect and wrongful death, which were similar to the Alabama case involving a chemical endangerment statute. But there is no general ruling saying a fetus is a person or granting personhood status to the preborn in all circumstances, according to constitutional and reproductive law experts.

Becker claimed that no other court had made personhood rulings, but our research found that that is not the case. We rated Becker’s claim False.",/factchecks/2013/feb/08/dan-becker/abortion-foe-overreaches-describing-context-court-/
"['Ohio', 'Guns', 'Joyce Beatty']","
Rep. Joyce Beatty says about 30,000 people die from gunfire each year in the U.S.
","
The pre-Christmas slaughter of 20 elementary school children and six adults at a Connecticut elementary school has renewed public debate over how to prevent future mass killings with guns.

On Jan. 14, members of the Congressional Black Caucus, now chaired by Warrensville Heights Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge, weighed in on that question by delivering a series of speeches on the House of Representatives floor that decried a U.S. ""culture of violence.""

Newly elected Columbus Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty used the opportunity to deliver her first oration on the House of Representatives floor. In it, she lamented that ""mass killings have gone from being an extremely rare occurrence to a common occurrence,"" and suggested the U.S re-examine its funding for mental health services, place adequate controls on ammunition and  ""ensure proper and tighter access to firearms.""

""According to Harvard Health Policy Review, each year approximately 30,000 people in the United States die as a result of gunfire, and about 80,000 people are wounded,"" the former Ohio state legislator noted, applauding President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden for ""proactively taking the necessary steps to address this critical issue.""


We wondered whether Beatty’s statistics were accurate, so we decided to track them down.

We soon found an article in the Fall 2001 issue of Harvard Health Policy Review, titled The Costs and Benefits of Reducing Gun Violence, that begins with the exact wording used by Beatty - ""Each year, approximately 30,000 people in the United States die as a result of gunfire and about 80,000 are wounded."" But the date of that article gave us pause. The numbers it cited were more than a decade old. We wanted to find more recent numbers.

We turned to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics to verify the information. The latest available version of its data says there were 31,672 firearms deaths in the United States during 2010, a ratio of 10.3 deaths per 100,000 people. That number  is a bit higher than the number Harvard Health Policy Review cited in 2001, although it is certainly in the ballpark.

The second set of CDC data we examined tracks non-fatal gun injuries. By the CDC’s reckoning, there were 73,883 non-fatal firearm injuries in 2011, a rate of 23.7 injuries per 100,000 people. That number is a bit lower than the number Beatty cited from the Harvard Health Policy Review, although it isn’t too far off. If the number of non fatal injuries from BB or pellet guns were added into the mix, the number of injuries from 2011 would exceed Harvard’s estimate of 80,000 yearly wounds from gunfire. According to CDC, 16,451 people in the United States were hurt by pellet guns - about 5.3 incidents per 100,000 people.

Beatty accurately represented the statistics printed in Harvard Health Policy Review, even though its tally was more than a decade old. More recent data indicates those numbers haven’t changed much over the years. We rate her statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/feb/08/joyce-beatty/rep-joyce-beatty-says-about-30000-people-die-gunfi/

Rhode Island Coastal Resources geologist says sea level has risen roughly 10 inches since 1930
","Sandy, the so-called ""superstorm"" that struck the East Coast in October 2012, did more than produce massive damage. It also got a lot of people talking about climate change.

Climate scientists say Earth is warming, and most say it’s due to polluting gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. Stronger storms are one predicted result.

And scientists say the storms are going to be even more damaging because the excess heat will cause sea level to rise, both by a melting of the polar ice caps and because water expands as it warms.

When Janet Freedman, a coastal geologist with Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Council, talked about the risk of coastal flooding during an appearance on WJAR-TV’s ""10 News Conference,"" she said the local rise in sea level is pretty clear.

The levels ""have been rising,"" she said. ""In Rhode Island we have two long-term tide gauges that have been measuring the sea level since 1930 and we've seen that they've risen maybe about 10 inches since that time.

""But we anticipate that with global warming, that's going to be faster, it's going to accelerate. Most models show we'll see a foot of sea-level rise as early as 2030 but definitely 2050 we expect to see sea levels that are higher than they are now.""

PolitiFact doesn't rate predictions, so we focused on whether sea level has really risen about 10 inches over the past eight decades -- an average of 1.25 inches every 10 years.

We contacted Freedman, who sent us to several sources.

The Sea Levels Online website, part of the Tides & Currents portion of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website, has data from tide gauges around the world. Selecting ""Rhode Island"" sends you to data from gauges in Newport and Providence.

The Newport data show that from 1930 to 2006, the mean water level has risen by 2.58 millimeters -- about a tenth of an inch -- per year. Data that take the readings through 2011 show that the overall rate over that 81-year-period has actually increased to 2.70 mm/year. We calculate the rise from 1930 to 2012 to be 211.6 mm or 8.7 inches. That's not 10 inches, but Freedman said ""maybe about.""

(It's also important to note that there is a margin of error in these numbers because they are averages based on readings that fluctuate due to waves, tides, winds and other factors. The average may be 8.7 inches but the real number could be as high as 9.3 inches or as low as 8.1 inches. The odds of it being outside this ""confidence interval"" during that period are 1 in 20.)

The Providence tide gauge hasn't produced as much data. Records begin around 1940 and there is a large gap in the 1950s. But the overall rate as of 2011 is also lower: 2.19 mm per year. If we extrapolate that back to 1930 and forward to 2012, that's 179.6 mm or 7.1 inches since 1930. Although the margin of error could take it as high as 8.0 inches, somewhat further from 10 inches than the Newport data.

We also contacted Jon Boothroyd of the University of Rhode Island, who is designated by the U.S. Geological Survey as the state geologist. He crunches the tide gauge numbers a bit differently, taking the monthly data and averaging it for a year. He has also included more recent data. His estimate: 269 mm per 100 years. Over 82 years, that would be 220.6 mm, which is 8.7 inches as well. (The range here is 9.4 inches to 7.9 inches.)

However, Boothroyd said that if you look at the actual year-to-year annual readings from Newport between 1930 and 2011, the increase has been about 270 mm, or 10.6 inches.

Boothroyd said he doesn't use the Providence tide gauge data because he had doubts about it -- the readings are too far off from the Newport readings.

Sea level can fluctuate if land rises or falls, for example. But between Providence and Newport, ""the bedrock and the conditions are so close to one another, it doesn't make sense why that rate of sea level rise is lower than it is in Newport,"" he said. The gauge in Providence ""is on a pier, and I don't think the pilings on that pier are sunk to bedrock. So the pier could be slowly subsiding, but the gauge shows exactly the opposite. So I don't use that number because I can't understand it. It's a really sticky wicket.""

These days, satellites offer the best measurement of sea levels, and they do it every 10 days across most of the world, said Steven Nerem a climate researcher at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

""The satellites are all referenced to Earth's geocenter, so our data are not affected by the land motion,"" he said.

In addition, coastal temperatures, winds, the saltiness of the water, atmospheric pressure and ocean currents all have an effect on the height of the water at individual locations, which is why researchers have to use a global average and look at long-term trends.

For example, when the Pacific warms during an El Nino, ""you have more precipitation over the oceans than in the continents, and you get a short-term increase in sea level,"" said Nerem ""When you have La Nina (Pacific cooling), you get more precipitation over the continents and the water gets stored there for some period of time, so you have a temporary lowering of sea level.""

According to the satellite data, available at the website sealevel.colorado.edu, the global sea level has risen by 3.2 mm per year since 1993. If you assume that the rise has been steady since 1930, that would translate to an average worldwide increase of 10.3 inches. (Range: 9.0 inches up to 11.6 inches.)

Is the pace of sea level rise increasing?

""That's the $10 million question,"" said Nerem. ""Over the last 100 years there is a suggestion that  there is a small acceleration. If you just look at the satellite data, we don't see an acceleration. So over the last 20 years, it may just be too small, given all this variability, to detect.""

Boothroyd, however, said, ""There is some indication that worldwide sea level has risen at a faster rate since 1990. Our graph suggests that is true for Newport"" citing the uptick in 2010 and 2011.

Freedman said Boothroyd's numbers, which show a slightly higher annual increase, may be pointing to sea levels rising faster today. ""This trend seems to suggest that we are seeing acceleration in sea level rise over the last 20 years, but because there is so much variability in sea levels we really need forty years of sea levels to say that with scientific certainty.""

Our ruling

Janet Freedman, a geologist with Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Council, said, ""In Rhode Island we have two long-term tide gauges that have been measuring the sea level since 1930 and we've seen that they've risen maybe about 10 inches since that time.""

Her ""maybe about"" phrase gives her some wiggle room.

The long-term trend in Newport doesn't quite measure up to 10 inches. It's 8.7 inches. But the actual annual measurements at the beginning and end of that time period meet the truth test, mostly because of a steep -- and not explained -- increase over the last few years.

The Providence tide gauge data, on the other hand, show a much smaller trend over that time period -- it would be just over 7 inches.

Freedman's overarching point that sea levels have been rising is certainly true, and that's borne out by satellite data.

Pinning down the actual size of the rise is as difficult as measuring the precise height of a wave.  

Because her statement is essentially on-target but needs clarification or additional perspective, we rate it Mostly True.

"['Corporations', 'Small Business', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
Rep. Paul Ryan says small businesses are now taxed at higher rate than corporations
","
Emerging after a quiet post-election period, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan sat for questions from David Gregory, moderator of NBC’s Meet the Press, who posited that many business owners want Washington to cut a fiscal deal that includes tax increases.

Ryan begged to differ.

""They believe we should have tax reform,"" Ryan, the 2012 GOP vice presidential candidate, said during his Jan. 27, 2013 appearance. ""We have the highest corporate tax rate in the world. We’re taxing our small businesses now at rates higher than corporations. We should have lower tax rates so we can be competitive.""

It’s well established that the U.S. corporate tax rate of 35 percent is the highest in the world, at least on paper.

But is America ""taxing our small businesses now at rates higher than corporations""?

The starting point here is the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, the law spawned by the New Year’s Day deal that prevented the nation from heading over the ""fiscal cliff"" of spending cuts that was set to trigger in 2013.

Among many other things, the cliff deal left the federal corporate tax rate at 35 percent, but raised the top personal tax rate to 39.6 percent. Ryan voted for the bill, bucking a majority of his fellow Republicans. Democrats were overwhelmingly in favor. The final tally was 257-167.

The change in individual income tax rates is relevant to business owners because some small businesses and large firms structure themselves as ""pass-through"" entities such as S corporations or partnerships, rather than traditional corporations. Profits for those entities are taxed under the individual income tax code rather than under the corporate tax structure.

Tax experts we consulted agreed that the cliff legislation means that at least some small business owners will be paying more than corporations.

So there is a basis for Ryan’s claim.

But there are problems with his broad statement that, ""We’re taxing our small businesses now at rates higher than corporations.""

Ryan’s claim, unqualified as it is, leaves the listener with the impression that the higher rates are just a fact of life for small businesses under the bill signed by President Barack Obama.

That’s not the case.

There is not yet a study that analyzes how small business would be affected by the taxation changes in the American Taxpayer Relief Act.

But Ryan’s office pointed us to a pair of federal government reports that included projections of how earlier Obama tax proposals might affect businesses. They cited parts of the studies that found Obama’s plans meant that about half of all net business income would have been subject to rates over the 35 percent corporate rate.

That suggests a broad effect.

But both of the figures refer to business income, not just small business income.

They are not one and the same.

As PolitiFact Ohio noted in January 2013, ""pass through"" businesses that actually file under the individual income-tax code include some very large outfits, including ""sole proprietorships and such partnerships as big law firms and financial funds. Goldman Sachs was classified as a partnership before it went public in 1999.""

One of the studies cited by Ryan, an August 2010 report by the Joint Committee on Taxation, did not attempt to define small business.

The other Ryan-cited study did attempt to define small businesses from within that larger pool. It was a 2011 report by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Analysis using 2007 tax data. It’s dated, but is the most comprehensive try at the subjective task of defining what is a small business, and it is widely cited by tax researchers.

The study, as Ryan’s camp noted, found about 50 percent of business income was on returns filed by taxpayers who were in the top tax bracket. (It was that top tax rate that was raised for 2013.)

But when that same study filtered out larger businesses, the percentage of affected business income dropped to 24 percent to 27 percent, depending on the definition of small business.

We found another measure in the report that is relevant to this claim -- the total number of businesses.

Looking just at what it defined as small businesses, the Treasury study found that ""approximately half of our small businesses reported total income less than $50,000, and almost 90 percent reported net income less than $50,000.""

That is nowhere near the threshold for the highest tax rate. So, the tax rate for pass-through business income at that level would be nowhere near a point greater than the corporate rate of 35 percent.

What’s more, only 2 percent or 3 percent of ""pass through"" entities defined in the Treasury study as small businesses were at the top tax rate.

That study is dated, but the finding is relevant because the new top rate (39.6 percent) under the fiscal-cliff deal applies to nearly the same income levels as the old top rate. We heard that from tax experts at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution’s Tax Policy Center, the Tax Foundation and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities -- groups that span the ideological spectrum.

There’s another issue with Ryan’s statement, pointed out by Joseph Rosenberg, a researcher at the Tax Policy Center, a joint Urban Institute-Brookings Institution project.

Because the Treasury study is from 2011, it analyzed an earlier Obama proposal, not the fiscal cliff legislation (the American Taxpayer Relief Act). The earlier proposal would have raised more high-earning taxpayers into a new bracket above 35 percent than does the cliff deal.

On the other hand, William McBride of the Tax Foundation told us the number of pass-through entities has grown relative to the number of corporations since 2007, the year the Treasury study analyzed. And the fiscal-cliff deal could affect business taxes in other ways, including through its new limits on tax deductions.

Finally, it should be noted that small business owners are not forced to file under the individual tax code. If they are being bumped into a higher tax rate because of the 2013 vote, they could reorganize and file under the corporate tax rate, which was unchanged.

Many won’t because there are advantages to passing through income to individual taxpayers, said Chuck Marr and Chye-Ching Huang of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

McBride addressed the same point.

""Yes, pass-through businesses can choose to file as c-corporations, but it is a costly and lengthy process,"" he wrote in an email. ""Plus, the c-corporation tax rate is the highest in the developed world. Out of the fry pan and into the fire.""

Our rating

Ryan’s critique of the U.S. tax system included a remark that, ""We’re taxing our small businesses now at rates higher than corporations.""

That will be true in some cases, applying to a not-insubstantial amount of business profits. But a credible study suggests that many, or even most, small-businesses have income that the new top tax rate won’t touch. And the system allows them to file under the corporate tax system if they so desire.

Ryan’s statement has an element of truth but ignores facts that would leave a different impression.

That’s our definition of Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/feb/07/paul-ryan/rep-paul-ryan-says-small-businesses-are-now-taxed-/

Barbara Buono claims state reform ""eliminated collective bargaining for health benefits""
","
Just as Gov. Chris Christie celebrates how he approved pension and health benefits reform in June 2011, state Sen. Barbara Buono says she stood up for her beliefs by opposing the landmark bill.

As the senator emerged last week as the most likely Democrat to take on the Republican governor in his re-election bid this year, Buono claimed in TV interviews that she rejected the legislation because it eliminated collective bargaining for public employees’ health benefits.

Buono, who was Senate Majority Leader when the reform passed, broke with Senate President Stephen Sweeney when she voted against the legislation. That vote likely contributed to her ultimately losing the leadership post.

In a Jan. 28 interview on NJToday, Buono (D-Middlesex) said she ""drew a line in the sand when it came to eliminating collective bargaining for employee health benefits.""

The senator repeated that claim in an interview the following day on Fox 5’s Good Day New York.

""I’ll continue to stand up for what I believe in, even if it’s not politically expedient -- and that is, I opposed this last piece of legislation that also eliminated collective bargaining for health benefits,"" Buono said.

The 2011 reform mandates increases in health care contributions without employees’ approval through negotiations, but the senator’s wrong to suggest that bargaining right is eliminated forever.

Once the increases are fully implemented after a four-year period, unions can resume negotiating those contribution levels.

Let’s review the legislation.

Signed into law by Christie on June 28, 2011, the reform requires employees to contribute higher payments toward their pension and health care benefits. Phased in over four years, the health care contributions are based on a percentage of one’s premium and vary according to salaries and levels of coverage.

The new contribution levels took effect immediately for employees whose union contracts had expired. For workers under an existing contract when the law went into effect, the payment levels and four-year time frame begin when their contract expires.

Those increases are non-negotiable, but after the fourth year of implementation, the health care contributions can become part of union negotiations.

Here’s what the law says:

""After full implementation, those contribution levels shall become part of the parties’ collective negotiations and shall then be subject to collective negotiations in a manner similar to other negotiable items between the parties.""

But David Turner, communications director for the Buono campaign, argued in an e-mail that the legislation took away workers’ bargaining right to negotiate health benefits when it imposed higher costs without their consent.

""Sen. Buono strongly believes in the right of workers to collectively bargain for their health benefits,"" Turner said. ""Governor Christie's legislation explicitly takes away this right by unilaterally imposing higher costs without workers' consent.

""This is by definition eliminating employees right to negotiate their healthcare. Collective bargaining was vital in building the middle class in New Jersey and America and Sen. Buono will continue to support this fundamental right.""

 Our ruling

In a TV interview, Buono claimed that the pension and health benefits reform ""eliminated collective bargaining for health benefits.""

The reform does mandate higher health care contributions over a four-year period without the employees’ approval through negotiations, but the senator is wrong to suggest that bargaining right is eliminated indefinitely.

After the payment increases have been fully implemented, those contribution levels return to the bargaining table as a part of union negotiations.

We rate the statement Half True.

Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern says Gov. John Kasich has power to force school board president to step aside
","
Re-posting an item from a friend on Facebook led to calls for the resignation of the president of the Ohio Board of Education, Debe Terhar.
Terhar, a Republican from Cincinnati, re-posted a photograph of Hitler with a caption reading: ""Never forget what this tyrant said: ‘To conquer a nation, first disarm its citizens.’ — Adolf Hitler.""

The Columbus Dispatch, reporting the story, said the item originated ""with the Facebook page of Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children, which features a variety of anti-Obama, pro-gun posts and pictures.""

After the story appeared, Terhar removed the material, and then closed her Facebook page. She issued a statement saying she was not comparing President Obama to Hitler, had not researched the posted material and had made no comment on it.

A little research might have saved a lot of trouble.

Our friends at the myth-busting site Snopes.com could not find any source documenting the purported Hitler quote. Neither could Salon.com, which pointed us to a 2004 paper by University of Chicago law professor Bernard Harcourt. He found the quote ""is probably a fraud and was likely never uttered."" (Harcourt further noted that the Weimar government immediately before Hitler’s had tougher gun laws than the Nazi regime.)

Terhar, who is married to Ohio Rep. Lou Terhar, said in a statement that she regretted ""the consequences of carelessly sharing"" the posted material and would be ""more selective in my use of social media in the future.""

Gov. John Kasich said he saw no need for further action.

""It was clearly a mistake, and she says it was a mistake,"" he told the Dispatch from the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. ""I’m glad that she’s come out and said she’s sorry about it, that it’s a mistake, and she’s not going to do it again.""

Ohio Democrats led calls for Terhar to resign. Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern went further in a statement.

""In absence of a full, formal apology from Terhar,"" Redfern said, ""Kasich has a duty to remove his hand-picked state school board president from office.""

A subsequent email from Redfern that solicited letters to Kasich and the school board demanding Terhar's resignation carried the subject line, ""Tell Kasich: Fire Terhar!""

PolitiFact Ohio wondered if Kasich had the power to do that. We called Redfern's office.

A party spokesman, Jerid Kurtz, told us that Redfern understands Kasich has no direct formal power to remove Terhar, but Kasich does have a bully pulpit as the state's most visible and arguably most powerful public figure. The governor should issue a statement of no confidence, rather than his initial ""no comment,"" and can pressure Terhar to resign as president, Kurtz said for Redfern.

Kurtz noted that Kasich showed power over the board two years ago by forcing out Superintendent Deborah Delisle, who resigned, citing pressure from the governor’s office.

The state superintendent serves at the discretion of the board. Delisle said in a letter to board members that Kasich’s administration had informed her that a majority of the board would replace her if she did not step down. The same day, Terhar was elected board president by fellow board members with Kasich’s support, reversing the outcome of a vote two months earlier.

Using that example, one would conclude that if Kasich wanted Terhar gone from the president’s chair, he has the influence to make it happen.

Removing her from the board altogether would be a different matter.

The board is made up of 19 members. Eleven are elected on a district basis, and eight are appointed by the governor.

Terhar, self-described as ""an early participant in the Tea Party,"" is an elected member from Cincinnati representing Hamilton and Warren counties. She started her four-year term on Jan. 1, 2011, was elected board president in March 2011 and re-elected unanimously by the board to the post last month.

Her seat on the board is not among the positions subject to removal at the pleasure of the governor under the Ohio Revised Code.

Under the code and the state constitution, in fact, Ohio lacks any provision for the recall of state officials.

So what's the verdict here?

Terhar posted a bogus quotation and false history. Whether there should be consequences is a matter of opinion that we can't rate. That includes calls for her resignation.

Redfern's statement that Kasich ""has a duty to remove"" her, however, means that Kasich has the power to do so.

The Democratic Party spokesman, explaining Redfern’s remarks, said the call for Terhar’s resignation or removal extended only to her position as school board president, not as a board member. That’s an important distinction.

He acknowledged that Kasich does not have statutory control over the Board of Education, but he accurately cited Kasich’s forcing out of a state school superintendent as a demonstration of the governor’s power over the board.

D.C. voting-rights post offers hit-and-miss data

For decades, residents of Washington, D.C., have been clamoring for representation in Congress. Currently, the nation’s capital has only a non-voting delegate in the U.S. House of Representatives and no U.S. senators. The issue has been such a frustration that D.C. license plates feature the protest motto, ""Taxation Without Representation.""

It’s against this backdrop that we noticed a Facebook post recently. Here’s the text:

""Washington, D.C., now has:
""Greater population than Wyoming & Vermont
""More active duty military than 29 states
""More tax revenue than 29 states
""A larger domestic product than 27 states
""But no vote on the floor of the House OR the Senate?
""What’s up with that?""

We wondered how accurate the post’s claims were, so we took a look. We’ll take them in order.

• Greater population than Wyoming and Vermont

This one’s true, as long as you use 2012 population estimates rather than the last full Census count in 2010. (D.C.’s population grew quickly within that two-year span.) In 2012, the district was estimated to have 632,323 residents, putting it ahead of Vermont at 626,011 and Wyoming at 576,412, but no other state.

• More active duty military than 29 states

The most recent data we found was for 2009, and it shows that the Facebook post actually underestimated the nation’s capital. There are 31 states that had fewer active duty military personnel than D.C. (This may not be too surprising, given that the Pentagon is just across the river in Virginia.)

 • More tax revenue than 29 states

The U.S. Census Bureau ranks all 50 states by tax revenue collected, but it doesn’t include D.C. However, we were able to find the D.C. data separately, in a D.C. government document.

Meshing the data together, we found that D.C. total tax revenue for fiscal year 2011 was higher than 14 states, not 29 states. So this claim is incorrect.

• A larger gross domestic product than 27 states

Data from the U.S. Commerce Department shows that for fiscal year 2011, the district only outranked 17 states with a smaller gross domestic product than D.C. So this statistic is off the mark as well.

Our ruling

We found that the Facebook post was accurate in describing D.C.’s ranking in population and active-duty military personnel, but significantly off in describing tax revenues and gross domestic product. That said, D.C.’s actual rankings -- higher than 14 states in tax revenues and higher than 17 states in gross domestic product -- do support the post’s underlying point that many smaller states have congressional representation when D.C. does not.

"['Education', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott says his budget proposal has “the highest state funding level in history” for education
","
Gov. Rick Scott trumpeted his ""Florida Families First"" budget as providing record-breaking money for schools, including $2,500 raises for teachers.

""This total includes $10.7 billion in state funding for Florida K-12 schools, the highest state funding level in history,"" Scott said in a Jan. 31, 2013, news conference about his 2013-14 budget recommendations.

The crowd of teachers and university presidents huddled around Scott applauded his comment. We thought it merited another look.

Overall education spending vs. state spending

Scott was very careful to specify state funding for education would be higher than ever in his proposed budget. But schools are funded by more sources than the state. The complex school-funding formula includes local taxes and, in recent years, federal stimulus dollars, too.

Scott’s press team directed us to a breakdown of state and local school funding for the past 10 years. It does not include federal stimulus funding.The blue bar represents state funding, the green bar represents local funding, and the orange horizontal line at the top represents per-pupil funding. 

Looking at education spending this way excludes $1.78 billion in economic stimulus money Florida received to bolster its 2009-10 and 2010-11 budgets, so spending in those years should actually appear slightly closer to Scott’s new proposal.

Let’s take a closer look at the education spending Scott proposed. He wants the state to spend $18.47 billion for education during the 2013-14 school year. Again, the state’s share of that would be about $10.7 billion.

So if the Legislature passes a budget that precisely mirrors Scott’s education proposals, the state’s share of education spending would be its highest since 2007-08, when it was $9.71 billion. In terms of the state’s actual dollar investment, Scott is right that it would be the highest.

However, total state and local education spending in Scott’s budget would be $280 million smaller than the 2007-08 budget signed by Gov. Charlie Crist.

What’s in the $1.2 billion increase from last year’s education spending? About $480 million would go toward teacher raises and $300 million would go toward the unfunded liability of the state’s retirement system. There’s some debate as to whether the pension funding should be considered part of an education increase, but a couple experts told us it’s reasonable because past calculations of the state’s per-pupil funding have included the cost of teacher wages, part of which goes to the retirement system.

Breaking it down per student

Of course, there are other ways of looking at state education spending. One is to look at spending per student. 
As a whole, counting state and local funding, per-pupil funding under Scott’s new budget would be $6,799. That’s short of what it was before the economic recession, when per-pupil funding peaked in 2007-08 at $7,126. So back then, the state had fewer students and was providing more money for each. Now we have 85,000 more students, according to DOE numbers, but less money for each one. 
But if you only look at the state’s per-pupil level of $3,941 in Scott’s new budget, it does exceed funding levels for the past 10 years in terms of actual dollars. 
And inflation?

We’ll close with a point about inflation. When adjusted for inflation, does Scott’s budget still stand up as the state’s biggest education investment?

We used a Consumer Price Index calculator from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to compare Scott’s proposal with state spending on education for the past 10 years. (BLS has not released CPI data for January 2013, so the comparisons use 2012 inflation rates.)

The takeaway is that state spending on education, when adjusted for inflation, would not be significantly different than it was from 2004 to 2007.

Still, even the Florida Education Association, the state teachers union that sued Scott over the 2011 merit pay plan, conceded the state has never invested more, and that it is reasonable to consider the proposed $300 million contribution to the state’s retirement system as part of the $1.2 billion increase for education.

""Added money spent on public schools always helps grow our economy,"" said FEA President Andy Ford in a statement. ""We look forward to the governor’s strong advocacy of this proposal.""

Our ruling

Scott said his budget ""includes $10.7 billion in state funding for Florida K-12 schools, the highest state funding level in history."" 
Floridians hearing this statement might think that means education funding for Florida schools has never been higher. That's not the case. 
Actually, Scott is referring only to the state government's specific contribution to overall spending. Scott drums up the state share as an historic investment, and it is in terms of actual dollars. 
But there are also local and federal dollars that fund Florida schools. When you consider those, Scott's overall recommendation for education spending is still short of what Florida students received before the economic crash. It's about the same as it was under Gov. Jeb Bush when considering inflation.  
Scott’s claim is partially accurate, but it leaves out important details that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2013/feb/06/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-his-budget-proposal-has-highest-st/
"['State Budget', 'States', 'Wisconsin', 'Leon Young']","
Wisconsin legislator says he and colleagues worked 7 days in 2012, got paid for 365
","
We're often asked at PolitiFact Wisconsin how we choose statements to fact check on the Truth-O-Meter.

The answer is: Really?

As in: Did a politician, pundit or organization make a claim that would make an average person  stop and wonder: Really?

On Jan. 19, 2013, the Wisconsin State Journal reported on a proposal by state Rep. Leon Young, D-Milwaukee, to make state lawmakers part time and cut their pay by 75 percent.

Why would Young want to gore his own ox?

""After reviewing the number of days that we were in session during the course of the 2011-’12 biennium, I realized that we met a total of only 34 days out of a possible 122 session days,"" Young told the Madison newspaper. ""It is fair to say that we actually function as a 'de facto' part-time legislature now.""

When you look only at the number of session days in 2012, Young added, the number drops to seven. ""Who works seven days and gets paid for a whole year?"" he asked.

State lawmakers worked seven days in 2012 but got ""paid for a whole year""?

Really?

Cue the Truth-O-Meter.

Young's proposal

Young has served in the state Assembly since 1993 but has not always won easy re-election. Beset by two foreclosure judgments and restraining orders involving two women, the former Milwaukee police officer faced three challengers in the 2008 Democratic primary.

Young prevailed, arguing he had worked hard to bring investment in infrastructure and jobs to the city. In 2010, Young defeated a Democratic challenger and in 2012 he ran unopposed.

Young’s proposal is for a constitutional amendment to have lawmakers meet only during the first three months of the year. Their salary would be cut by 75 percent — to $12,000 a year from the current $49,943 an amount last raised in 2009).

In Wisconsin, most state lawmakers list something besides full-time legislator as their occupation. But in terms of pay and benefits, the Legislature certainly could be considered full time.

The $49,943 salary is more than the median household income in Wisconsin, which was $49,001, according to the 2010 U.S. census.

And state lawmakers enjoy benefits that are at least on par with full-time workers. The benefits include a pension, and health, life, vision insurance, each of which require contributions by the lawmakers.

But what about their workload?

Young's evidence

When we asked Young for evidence that lawmakers worked only seven days in 2012, he referred us to the office of the Assembly chief clerk. It confirmed the full Legislature was in session on seven days in 2012.

But Young is doing a bit of cherry-picking to make his broader point -- something he acknowledged when we contacted him.

The Legislature meets in two-year sessions. In the first year, lawmakers work on and adopt a two-year state budget. They meet less often the second year, when all Assembly members and half of the senators are up for re-election.

In 2011-2012, with Republicans controlling the Assembly and the Senate, the full Legislature met a total of 34 days -- 27 days in 2011 plus the seven in 2012.

In the previous two-year session, with Democrats in charge of both chambers, the Legislature met on 37 days -- 25 days in 2009 and 12 days in 2010.

Although state lawmakers’ main responsibility is to make policy by adopting laws, they do more than attend full sessions of the Legislature, right?

Let’s start with Young.

He lists his occupation as a full-time legislator and claims to put in more time in Madison than nearly all of his colleagues.

In 2012, Young claimed $11,792 in expenses, the third-highest reimbursement in the 99-member Assembly. The reimbursements, known as per diem payments, are $88 per day, an amount that has been in place since 2001; the reimbursements are meant to cover food and lodging costs while lawmakers are in Madison on state business.

In 2011, Young ranked 12th, collecting $12,056; he ranked similarly high in reimbursements in previous years.

Young acknowledged that in making his seven-days-of-work claim he wasn’t counting time lawmakers spend attending committee meetings in Madison, working on legislation, studying issues, handling constituent matters or spending time back home in their districts.

Indeed, committee meetings alone can be a significant workload. Young is assigned to four committees for the 2013-2014 session. Other lawmakers serve on six or more committees; Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Shorewood, serves on nine.

An independent research group, the National Conference of State Legislatures, also regards the Wisconsin Legislature as essentially a full-time body.

A 2009 analysis, which the group said remains up to date, found that 10 states -- including Wisconsin, Michigan and Illinois -- ""require the most time of legislators, usually 80 percent or more of a full-time job.""

Now, critics may say state lawmakers don’t work hard enough, or aren’t worth their pay, or should spend most of their time at home. But that’s a lot more than seven days.

Really.

Our rating

Young said Wisconsin legislators worked only seven days in 2012 but got ""paid for a whole year.""

The veteran Assembly member admitted his statement didn’t account for all the duties lawmakers have. In fact, it didn't come close.

Chris Christie tells David Letterman that $60 billion in Katrina aid was approved “on a voice vote”
","It took Congress three months to sign off on federal aid for Hurricane Sandy victims, but Gov. Chris Christie said federal officials approved $60 billion in aid within just 10 days of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

And that Katrina aid was authorized without members of Congress even casting roll call votes, according to the Republican governor.

In between pulling doughnuts out of his pockets, Christie offered that background during his appearance Monday on the ""Late Show with David Letterman."" The late-night host questioned whether the delay in securing Sandy aid could have happened at any point.

""It didn’t happen eight years ago,"" Christie told Letterman. ""I mean, in Katrina, they approved $60 billion within 10 days of the storm on a voice vote.""

The governor’s right that about $60 billion in emergency aid was approved in the 10 days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana, but Christie is wrong to claim all of that money was approved ""on a voice vote.""

In a voice vote, members of Congress just shout out ""yea"" or ""nay"" without their individual votes being recorded. But contrary to what Christie said, most of that roughly $60 billion was approved by way of recorded votes. The governor’s office did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Let’s explain the different sets of votes on the Katrina aid.

As we confirmed in a previous fact-check, the Republican-controlled Congress approved two bills providing $62.3 billion in emergency funding in the 10 days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall on Aug. 29, 2005, near Buras, La.

On Sept. 2, 2005, Congress passed a bill to provide $10.5 billion in emergency aid related to damage caused by Katrina.

The House approved that bill by a voice vote, and the Senate approved the legislation by ""unanimous consent."" Under unanimous consent, there is no recorded vote and the bill is considered approved if no one objects.

But on Sept. 8, 2005, when Congress approved an additional $51.8 billion in emergency appropriations for Katrina victims, both chambers held recorded votes on the legislation.

The bill passed in the House by a 410-11 vote and in the Senate by 97-0. Twelve House members and three senators did not cast ballots on the measure.

So, although the first bill was approved without any recorded votes, the second bill -- which provided most of the $62.3 billion in funding -- was passed by recorded votes.

But just as Christie said, securing federal approval for Sandy aid took much longer. Three months after Hurricane Sandy made landfall near Atlantic City, President Barack Obama signed a bill on Jan. 29 to provide about $50 billion in emergency appropriations. The GOP-controlled House had approved the bill on Jan. 15, and the Democrat-led Senate passed it on Jan. 28. Earlier in January, the president signed a bill providing $9.7 billion for the National Flood Insurance Program to assist Sandy victims.

Our ruling

During his appearance on the ""Late Show with David Letterman,"" Christie claimed that ""in Katrina, they approved $60 billion within 10 days of the storm on a voice vote.""

But all of that funding was not approved by federal officials shouting ""yea"" or ""nay"" on the House and Senate floors. Congress signed off on $10.5 billion in Katrina aid without recorded votes, but the remaining $51.8 billion was approved by recorded votes.

Still, the governor’s overall point is solid. While Hurricane Sandy victims waited three months for federal aid to be approved, Congress had authorized $62.3 billion in the 10 days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana.

"['Abortion', 'Ohio', 'Rob Portman']","
Sen. Rob Portman says abortion clinics market their services to minors in states with stricter laws
","
Ohio and most other states require a parent’s consent or notification before they will allow a minor to have an abortion. Minors can get around this if they get a court order, or what’s known as ""judicial bypass.""

But minors have another option -- one that abortion opponents consider dastardly but that abortion rights activists defend as necessary sometimes. The minor can go to an abortion provider in one of 12 states that have no parental-involvement laws.

U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, wants to make it harder for non-parental adults to help minors bypass these state laws. Some of these adults do not have a girl’s best interest at heart when they transport her, say supporters of this effort, including Ohio Right to Life.

So on Jan. 24, Portman announced the latest version of a bill long sought by abortion opponents. He would make it a federal crime to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion if it would circumvent a state law requiring parental involvement.

In announcing his bill, Portman released a statement that caught the interest of PolitiFact Ohio: ""Ohio law requires the consent of one parent in order for a minor to get an abortion. Large, nearby states such as New York and Illinois, however, do not have such restrictions, and providers in those states have marketed their services to minors in states with parental consent requirements.""

Not that we eagerly stepped into this one, opinions being heated on both sides. But we wondered how this marketing worked, so we asked. Were abortion providers in less-restrictive states actually advertising across state lines to let minors know they could come over without telling their moms or dads?

Portman’s press secretary, Caitlin Dunn, answered the question by showing us an array of ads from the Internet and Yellow Pages. Some of what she sent us dated to a 2005 U.S. House of Representatives report on minors and abortions. But Dunn and others in her office also showed us more recent marketing efforts.

For example, she showed us the results of Internet searches on Yahoo and Google, using ""abortion"" as the keyword. She said the searches were conducted in Erie and other Pennsylvania cities by members of an anti-abortion group there. Pennsylvania has a parental-consent law.

We, too, got such sponsored, or paid, search results -- clearly marked as ads -- when we used Yahoo and Google to do web searches with the keywords ""abortion"" and ""Erie,"" and for searches using the names of other Pennsylvania cities as well.

One of the sponsored search results for the terms ""Erie PA""  and ""abortion"" was an ad that said:  ""South Jersey Board Certified (OBGYN) providing abortions in Cherry Hill, New Jersey."" Another ad said, ""Private, safe abortions."" The ads said nothing about minors or parental consent. But the headlines had links that took us to www.sjwc.net.

By clicking, we were transported to the website of the South Jersey Women’s Center, in Cherry Hill, a suburb of Philadelphia. Though not in Pennsylvania, the New Jersey clinic is about as close as a Pennsylvanian can get.

But it is also 429.6 miles from Erie, or a 6-hour and 44-minute drive, according to Google.

Why would a clinic so far from Erie advertise for clients more than 400 miles away?

Portman’s office suggested this is why: Near the top of the center’s website are the words, ""No 24-hour wait or parental consent required in New Jersey."" The no-consent clinic, in other words, was marketing to minors in parental-consent states, according to the Portman view.

We called the South Jersey Women’s Center to ask about its ads and website. A woman who answered said she was not authorized to talk to the media. But she referred us to the National Abortion Federation, an association in Washington, D.C. that says it strives to ensure women have access to safe, legal abortion care. So we called the federation and spoke with Vicki Saporta, the president and CEO.

Saporta said that just because the abortion clinic’s website says that ""parental consent is not required in New Jersey,"" that does not necessarily make it a marketing message.

""It’s just stating what the law is,"" she said, adding that it would be reasonable for any center to inform patients or potential patients about its services and its providers’ medical credentials, as this site does.  

""I think it’s important that women know what the laws are that govern any particular state if they are considering an abortion in that state,"" Saporta said.

The South Jersey center was not the only abortion provider believed by Portman’s office to be marketing to minors.

Dunn showed us other ads, from the Internet as well as from Yellow Pages across Pennsylvania.  An ad showing up in phone books in Scranton was for the clinic of Amy R. Cousins, M.D., in the Binghamton, N.Y. area. We found her clinic, too, in a paid Google ad when we searched under ""Scranton Pennsylvania abortion.""

Cousins’ Yellow Pages ad states, ""No state consents."" An ad from 2010 said, ""No consent or waiting period."" Her website says her center ""offers one-visit abortion services with no waiting period or parental consent to women living in Pennsylvania including Scranton, PA, Wilkes-Barre, PA and surrounding counties.""

We called Cousins’ clinic and spoke with Peg Johnston, the manager. Johnston has been active in national abortion-care networks and authored a guide promoting parental involvement.

""We advertise our services and all we have to offer,"" she said. This information, she said, helps patients or would-be patients know what services and procedures are available. ""We are completely within our rights to advertise whatever services we offer. It’s not like we’re luring"" minors over the state line.

About that state line, she said, ""We are 10 miles from the Pennsylvania border,"" and the closest abortion center for many women around Scranton. ""A lot of people come to New York for their health care because we’re closer"" than facilities in their home states, she said.

Portman’s office showed us other ads, from New York, New Jersey and Illinois, that stated ""no parental consent"" required. Some of the ads were nearly a decade old, others more recent. Based on this and our own Web searches, it appeared that Portman was correct in at least one regard -- that some abortion clinics in states that don’t have parental-consent laws were informing minors in other states of their parental-consent options.

But before we could rule on his claim that they have ""marketed their services to minors,""
we had another question to answer: What, exactly, is marketing? Is running a small web ad that says nothing about parental consent marketing? What if that web ad takes you to the provider’s website, where the ""no parental consent""  feature is included?

Is it marketing if the web ad appears in a Google or Yahoo search for ""abortion"" and ""Erie,"" but not a search for cities in other states?

In answering, it is helpful to understand how web ads work. They are not placed blindly or randomly. Companies and services pay to have their Web addresses come up when users type in -- or their computers or Web-browsing habits help detect --  specific parameters, including a location. This is called geo-targeting. Here is how Yahoo’s advertising department explains:

""Whether your online customers live in Little Rock, Arkansas, or near the Great Wall of China, having the ability to pinpoint where in the world your audience is can help drive results for your business. Yahoo!’s geographic targeting delivers your audiences at scale and drives measurable results.""

Even a small sponsored ad that shows a headline, a web address and little other information can be considered ""part of a larger marketing and communications plan,"" said Shelly Morton, a project manager and team leader for Hitchcock Fleming & Associates, an Akron marketing firm, if it takes you to a website with the full information the sponsor wanted you to have. The point of the ad is to have you click on it and get to that fuller information. We interviewed Morton to get an independent voice on Internet marketing, not to discuss abortion rights.

PolitiFact Ohio cannot tell you why a minor might use certain terms in a web search. But we  know most ads when we see them, and we generally understand how and why geo-tracking works. More important for assessing Portman’s claim, his office did not limit itself to Web searches or Web ads. It provided print ads, too. As Cousins’ clinic in New York told Yellow Page users in Pennsylvania, ""No state consents.""

This is information the clinics wanted patients or potential patients to have, and paid money to help them have it. Whether it was to help persuade them to come in or not, it provided pertinent facts that could help them in their decision-making. It fit the definition of marketing.

Do 30 percent of Banfield and Sunset evening commuters use the MAX?
","
For a city content to bill itself as the most sustainable in America, there’s always a fair share of debate over just how useful Portland's public transit is.

Do people even use those MAX cars? Seems like somebody is always asserting that empty trains abound.

But in a recent advertisement, TriMet pulled out an interesting statistic: ""MAX carries 30 percent of evening rush hour commuters traveling from Downtown on the Sunset and Banfield freeways.""

Right above that statement is a photograph of bumper-to-bumper freeway traffic and a MAX train cruising down the rails along side it.

The fact along with the picture begs the question, so we asked it: How could that train possibly be carrying 30 percent of all that freeway traffic?

We sent an email to TriMet spokeswoman Mary Fetsch to see how the agency came up with this fact and she sent us one right back with the documents we needed -- and more. (If only everybody were so helpful when we came calling.)

Here’s how TriMet figured it out:

They picked two points for gauging the traffic (both car and MAX) leaving downtown Portland on either of the freeways they mentioned. For the Banfield they used Lloyd Center and for the Sunset they used Goose Hollow. Both of those points are MAX stations as well as traffic-counting stations.

For the MAX piece of all of this, they simply looked at what the average ridership was for a weekday between the hours of 4:30 and 5:30 p.m. (About 2,200 riders went eastbound and 1,600 went westbound.)

Counting the folks traveling by car proved to be a little trickier, but not by much. The Oregon Department of Transportation counts the number of vehicles passing by certain counting stations through loop detectors embedded in the roadway. The data is archived in a system housed by Portland State University, so TriMet could easily figure out the average number of cars running in each direction.

Now, a car is not the same as a person, so you can’t do a one-to-one comparison with these two sets of data. But TriMet realized that. To get the average number of riders per car, TriMet turned to the Federal Highway Administration’s ""Summary of Travel Trends: 2009 National Household Travel Survey"" (the most recent available).

According to that survey, the average number of commuters in a vehicle is about 1.13. They took that number and multiplied it against the number of cars counted by the transportation department. What they found was that about 4,600 commuters traveled eastbound by car and about 4,400 traveled westbound by car.

If you compare those figures with the MAX commuting figure, you find that TriMet is right on the money: About 30 percent of evening commuters along the Banfield and Sunset highways use the MAX. (In case you’re curious, the number is slightly smaller for the morning commute, but not by much.)

Now, we did have one other nagging question: Was that 1.13 passengers per car figure that TriMet used fair in the context of Portland? After all, Portlanders commute by bike more often than the national average, maybe the same was true for carpooling.

We can’t be sure based on the study TriMet used, because it doesn’t offer city-specific figures. But we’re in luck because the Census gives us some indication. According to the most recent Census data from the American Community Survey, about 9.2 percent of Portlanders carpool. That puts us about in line with the national average of 9.7 percent.

None of this tells us whether 1.13 is exactly right, but we do feel that given the parity in the Census, it’s fair for TriMet to assume something close to parity here, too.

In an advertisement, TriMet said the ""MAX carries 30 percent of evening rush hour commuters traveling from Downtown on the Sunset and Banfield freeways."" They were able to back up this claim with reliable data.

State Sen. Richard Saslaw says in Virginia “one-third of the gasoline is purchased by out-of-state people”
","
Many Democrats oppose Gov. Bob McDonnell’s transportation plan, which would eliminate the state’s gasoline tax and raise the sales tax from 5 percent to 5.8 percent to fund road repair and construction.

Senate Minority Leader Richard Saslaw, D-Fairfax, told reporters that McDonnell’s plan would lift some of the tax burden for transportation paid by out-of-state motorists buying gas and put it on the back of Virginians purchasing goods.

""There’s no reason for us to put the whole burden on Virginia when one-third of the gasoline is purchased by out-of-state people and now we’re going to give them a free ride,"" he said on Jan. 9.

We see lots of cars with other states’ plates on Virginia’s roads, but do those visitors really account for one-third of the state’s gasoline sales?

We asked Saslaw, who once owned service stations in Northern Virginia, to back his claim that out-of-state drivers buy one-third of the gas in the state. He said the Department of Motor Vehicles has estimates showing visitors bought between 26 percent and 35 percent of the gasoline bought in Virginia.

We told Saslaw that the DMV denied ownership of the figure asked him if he could identify an official or a report that was his source. He said he could not, saying he did not recall. ""I heard it,"" he said. ""It was either the DMV or VDOT.""  

But officials at the Virginia Department of Transportation told us VDOT doesn’t know what percentage of gas is purchased by out-of-state drivers. When he relayed this to Salaw, he said, ""We got it from somewhere. I think I read it in the paper.""

We searched the archives of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, The Washington Post and The Virginian-Pilot and found a few references to a similar statistic.

An Emporia City Council member told the governor in August that 40 percent of the fuel bought along I-95 is done so by out-of-state drivers. And fellow Democratic Sen. Ralph Northam said that 35 percent of the fuels tax is paid by out-of-state drivers in an editorial in The Virginian-Pilot in March. But those references do not give any indication of their source.

We also turned to the U.S. Department of Transportation, which collects a federal excise tax. But like Virginia, the federal government also collects the levy from wholesalers and doesn’t gather statistics about the end users of gasoline.

Jeff Lenard, spokesman for the Association for Convenience and Fuel Retailing, said the statistic we were seeking doesn’t exist.

We stumbled on a possible source of the mythical figure. Mike O’Connor, president and CEO of the Virginia Petroleum, Convenience and Grocery Association, said he has estimated that visitors purchase 25 to 30 percent of the fuel in Virginia.

O’Connor noted that Virginia’s gasoline tax hasn’t increased since 1987. Since then, the number of registered cars in Virginia has increased by 63 percent while fuels tax revenues have gone up by 81 percent. The logical explanation for the different trajectories, he said, is that a large portion of the gas is being purchased by visitors to Virginia.

But the amount of fuel used by each vehicle has increased, too. Federal Highway Administration data shows that fuel use per vehicle per year in Virginia increased by 7.8 percent from 1987 to 2010, the most recent year for federal statistics. So the fuel use by vehicles registered in Virginia increased by 77 percent over that time.

O’Connor’s estimate is also not too useful because it doesn’t separate diesel, whose tax won’t change, from gasoline, whose tax would with the governor’s proposal. The Federal Highway Administration reports that diesel sales in the state grew 73.6 percent -- from 540.6 million gallons in 1987 to 938.4 million gallons in 2010. Meanwhile, gasoline sales increased 37.5 percent -- from 2.91 billion gallons to 4 billion gallons. So diesel contributed more to the jump in fuels tax revenue than gasoline did.

There’s a big difference between how O’Connor and Saslaw make their arguments, however. O’Connor acknowledges up front that his number is an estimate while Saslaw has presented his figure as fact.

Republicans have been trying debunk Saslaw’s claim. The McDonnell administration and House Speaker William Howell, R-Stafford, have been circulating a memo from the Virginia Department of Transportation that suggests the portion of gasoline purchased by out-of-state drivers is only about 9 percent.

VDOT came to the figure by noting that non-Virginians pay about 9.1 percent of the sales tax collected in the Old Dominion, according to the departments of Taxation and Tourism, and that 9.6 percent of drivers convicted of traffic violations are out-of-state visitors, according to state police.

The Transportation Department also tried to construct a mathematical proof. It started with a DMV report that the state, in 2011, had 6.6 million registered passenger vehicles and motorcycles. VDOT multiplied that number by 10,640 -- the average number of miles traveled by passenger vehicles according to the National Household Travel Survey from 2009.

The multiplication led VDOT to conclude that Virginians logged about 70.2 billion miles on state roads. That’s short of the 77.1 billion total miles that department had previously estimated. VDOT reasoned that 6.9 million mile gap was filled by out-of-state motorists, who would have accounted for 8.9 percent of all the road travel in Virginia.

VDOT’s proof is flawed, however. It assumes that Virginians drive every single mile in their home state. No one knows what percentage of the driving by Virginians occurs inside the state’s borders.

If Virginians did one-fourth of their driving out of the state, then under VDOT’s construct, visiting motorists would have accounted for one-third of the miles driven in the Old Dominion. That would give credence to Saslaw’s claim that non-Virginians pay one-third of the gas tax.

Our ruling

Saslaw, the senate minority leader, said one-third of the gasoline bought in Virginia is purchased by out-of-state motorists. He cited the statistic as a reason he and many other Democrats oppose the governor’s plan to raise money for roads by ending the state gas tax and increasing the sales tax. Saslaw said the plan would diminish Virginia’s ability to tax out-of-state drivers for using its roads and transfer that burden to Virginians.

Saslaw offered no credible proof to back his statistic. Each time we asked him, he cited a different possible source: the DMV, the Virginia Department of Transportation, maybe a newspaper article.

There’s a good reason none of his possible sources pan out: the statistic does not exist. Virginia taxes gasoline sales at the wholesale level, not at the pumps. So there’s no data on the percentage of gas purchased in Virginia by out-of-state drivers.

The burden of proof falls on Saslaw and he comes up empty. We could find no element of truth in his statement, which we rate False.",/factchecks/2013/feb/05/richard-saslaw/state-sen-richard-saslaw-says-virginia-one-third-g/
"['Georgia', 'Guns', 'Barack Obama']","
Did Reagan support an assault-weapons ban?
","About a month after a mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., left 20 schoolchildren and six adults dead, President Barack Obama rolled out a package of gun-control proposals during a speech with Vice President Joe Biden. The package included initiatives such as an assault-weapons ban that requires congressional approval, along with 23 executive actions that the president can implement on his own. The price tag for the package is estimated at $500 million.

In presenting the package, specifically the portion dealing with the assault-weapons ban, Obama made a point of conjuring past President Ronald Reagan’s stance on the same issue.

""Weapons designed for the theater of war have no place in a movie theater,"" Obama said during the speech. ""A majority of Americans agree with us on this. And, by the way, so did Ronald Reagan, one of the staunchest defenders of the Second Amendment, who wrote to Congress in 1994, urging them -- this is Ronald Reagan speaking -- urging them to listen to the American public and to the law-enforcement community and support a ban on the further manufacture of military-style assault weapons.""

Evoking past presidents is a frequent practice by politicians. Unfortunately, sometimes the context and the content of the recollections are incorrect. PolitiFact Georgia decided to check the accuracy of Obama’s statement, as well as whether most Americans support a ban on military-style assault weapons.

Obama pitched his gun plan at the White House surrounded by school-age children who had written letters to the president about the Newtown school shooting. In the audience were the parents of one of the students killed at Newtown’s Sandy Hook Elementary School, along with a survivor of the 2007 shooting massacre at Virginia Tech that left more than 30 people dead and an additional 15 wounded.

Against this emotional backdrop Obama’s plans drew immediate and intense reaction from supporting groups such as the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, as well as opponents such as the National Rifle Association.

Obama’s push for an assault-weapon’s ban hearkens to the original ban passed in 1994 that expired in 2004. At the time of that ban’s passage, Reagan -- who took office in 1981-- supported it. In a joint letter to The Boston Globe with Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, the former presidents wrote, ""While we recognize that assault weapon legislation will not stop all assault weapon crime, statistics prove that we can dry up the supply of these guns, making them less accessible to criminals.""

Eight years before this letter in the newspaper supporting the assault-weapons ban, Reagan, who was then president, signed into law the Firearm Owners Protection Act, which was supported by gun rights advocates. In addition to providing protections for gun owners, the act also banned ownership of any fully automatic rifles that were not already registered on the day the law was signed.

These items provide a framework for Reagan’s actions around an assassination attempt on his life months after taking office in 1981. The shooting left Reagan wounded and presidential press secretary James Brady paralyzed. The shooting provided the impetus for the Brady Bill, introduced in 1987, that required background checks for gun purchasers and a waiting period before a buyer could take possession of a gun.

In a 1991 New York Times op-ed titled ""Why I’m For the Brady Bill,"" Reagan detailed his support of a seven-day waiting period for gun buyers. ""Every year, an average of 9,200 Americans are murdered by handguns, according to Department of Justice statistics,"" Reagan said in the op-ed. ""… If the passage of the Brady bill were to result in a reduction of only 10 or 15 percent of those numbers (and it could be a good deal greater), it would be well worth making it the law of the land.""

""Reagan supported the Brady Bill. That was after he had left office, but he did support it,"" said Allan Lichtman, a professor of history at American University. ""His views are a little complicated because he also signed legislation easing the (1968) Gun Control Act, so you can take Reagan either way.""

As for the president’s assessment that ""a majority of Americans agree"" with the assault-weapons ban, we went to the polls for answers.

A Washington Post/ABC News poll involving guns, politics and governing priorities was conducted by telephone Jan. 10-13. The poll included a random national sample of 1,001 adults, including land-line and cellphone-only respondents. The poll’s results have a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.

The poll includes three pertinent questions about weapons bans:

-- Would you support or oppose a law requiring a nationwide ban on semi-automatic handguns, which automatically reload every time the trigger is pulled?
Fifty-one percent of all adults said yes; 46 percent said no. Fifty percent of registered voters said yes; 47 percent said no.

-- Would you support or oppose a law requiring a nationwide ban on high-capacity ammunition clips, meaning those containing more than 10 bullets?
Sixty-five percent of all adults said they supported a ban; 32 percent opposed. Those same numbers applied to registered voters.

-- Would you support or oppose a law requiring a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons?
Fifty-eight percent of all adults supported a ban; 39 percent opposed. Fifty-nine percent of registered voters supported a ban; 38 percent opposed.

So how does Obama’s statement rate?

During his speech laying out a package of gun-control proposals, the president evoked Reagan’s support of an assault-weapons ban. History shows that Reagan’s track record on guns is a winding road. He was a strong gun rights supporter who signed legislation easing an earlier gun law. But he also supported legislation for background checks and a waiting period for potential gun owners. He did support an assault-weapons ban and even joined two other former presidents in a letter to a major newspaper urging congressional approval of a ban.

Not only did Reagan support the ban, but so do most Americans, Obama said. Information from a Washington Post/ABC News poll supports the president’s statement.

On these two issues, we gave Obama a True rating.
