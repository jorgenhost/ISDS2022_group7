Claim that children will be harmed by spike proteins from COVID-19 vaccines is false
","COVID-19 vaccines have been safely tested in and approved for those ages 5 and older, but that has not stopped false, fear-inducing claims about risks of the vaccine to children. A TikTok video posted Jan. 3 shows footage of Dr. Robert Malone saying that when children are given vaccines for COVID-19, ""A viral gene will be injected into your children's cells. This gene forces your child’s body to make toxic spike proteins. These proteins often cause permanent damage in children’s critical organs."" The caption on the video reads, ""Listen please inventor of vaccine says do not get vaccine."" After the video was posted, the account appears to have been banned from TikTok for repeated violations of community standards. The TikTok video was shared on Facebook and was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Spike proteins are not toxic, and experts have told fact checkers there is no evidence that the spike proteins damage organs. Malone is the self-proclaimed inventor of messenger RNA vaccines, though that description has been disputed. He has ""leveraged that title to push one false claim after another,"" PolitiFact reported. The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA technology to instruct a person’s cells on how to create a piece of a spike protein. It’s the same protein found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19, so the immune system learns to recognize and respond to it. The mRNA vaccines ""involve the injection of a small part of the virus’s genetic code … in contrast to the more widespread ‘conventional’ vaccines which use a whole pathogen or fragment,"" Reuters reported. But claiming that the vaccine involves injecting a ""viral gene into your children’s cells"" appears to be a riff on numerous debunked claims that COVID-19 vaccines are a form of gene therapy. The mRNA vaccines do not change a person’s genetic makeup and never enter the part of the cell that hosts DNA. The spike proteins are harmless, do not cause illness and do not last long in the body. And the proteins do not cause long-term damage to organs. ""There is absolutely no evidence that the spike proteins can cause permanent damage to children's vital organs,"" American Academy of Pediatrics fellow Dr. Deborah Greenhouse told AFP Fact Check. We have previously fact-checked other claims about the safety of the spike protein. Each of these fact-checks concluded that there is no evidence that spike proteins are toxic or pose any serious health risk. And there is also no evidence to support the claim that the COVID-19 vaccine causes the body to continuously produce infectious spike bodies in children. A TikTok video shows footage of Dr. Robert Malone saying that when children are given vaccines for COVID-19, ""A viral gene will be injected into your children's cells. This gene forces your child’s body to make toxic spike proteins. These proteins often cause permanent damage in children’s critical organs."" The spike proteins generated by vaccines help trigger the body’s immune response. They are not toxic, do not cause illness and do not last long in the body. Experts say there is no evidence that the proteins cause damage to organs. We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2022/jan/07/tiktok-posts/claim-children-will-be-harmed-spike-proteins-covid/

No, Tylenol doesn’t ruin your ability to fight COVID-19
","As the highly transmissible omicron variant fuels a surge of COVID-19 cases across the country, treatment advice has ramped up on social media. Some users are warning against the use of Tylenol, with claims that it does more harm than good. Tylenol ""ruins your ability to kill the virus,"" one Instagram post said, adding that an infected person with a fever is better off letting it run its course.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Tylenol is an over-the-counter brand of pain reliever and fever reducer containing acetaminophen. The same ingredient is found in various other brands of pain relievers and over-the-counter medicines. We couldn’t find any evidence that the medication ""ruins"" the body’s ability to neutralize the virus. While a high temperature can help the body fight off a virus, doctors say, running a high fever could also be dangerous. The other claims in the post about Tylenol’s effects are also exaggerated. We’ll first note that it’s best to take medical advice from health care professionals, not from random social media posts, regardless of whether the poster has ""Dr."" in their username. Ben Lynch, the man who posted this image, is a naturopathic doctor who does not have a medical degree. Fever is one symptom of a COVID-19 infection, along with cough and shortness of breath. Common symptoms associated with the omicron variant include a headache, runny nose and sore throat, according to health officials. To treat COVID-19 symptoms at home, Harvard Medical School recommends taking acetaminophen to reduce fever and ease aches, as well as getting enough rest and staying hydrated. But if you are taking any combination cold or flu medicine, keep track of all the ingredients and doses, the medical school says, and don’t exceed a total of 3,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day. One regular-strength Tylenol tablet has 325 milligrams of acetaminophen. The Mayo Clinic also recommends rest and fluids for treating COVID-19, as well as cough medication and pain relievers such as Tylenol or ibuprofen. For otherwise healthy people — and not specifically for coronavirus — the medical center offers general tips on whether to treat a fever or let it run its course. For example, for adults with a temperature above 102, Mayo recommends acetaminophen, ibuprofen or aspirin. There is some scientific discussion about the potential value of fevers for fighting infection, but experts we spoke with told us they haven't seen anything to suggest that fevers resulting from COVID-19 infections should be treated any differently than those stemming from other infections.  ""It’s true that fever is an immune mechanism that enhances the ability of the body to clear infections, and treatment of mild fever with acetaminophen is not always necessary,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""However, fevers can be poorly tolerated in some individuals, so acetaminophen is indicated.""  Taking Tylenol before getting a vaccine may initially lower the amount of antibodies a person produces, Dr. Daniel B. Fagbuyi, an emergency room physician and former health adviser to the Obama administration, told PolitiFact. So many doctors recommend against people taking Tylenol before their shots. But there is no strong evidence that the medication affects long-term immune response, and physicians typically recommend taking Tylenol after a vaccine shot, or to treat symptoms from a COVID-19 infection. ""It has not been shown to cause a decrease in the immune response,"" Fagbuyi said.  He added that fevers are the body’s way of fighting an infection and not all are bad, but the post’s language about Tylenol ""ruining"" the body’s ability to kill the virus is inaccurate. Everyone is different, and health experts told us that people should discuss treatment with their doctor. Tylenol can have harmful effects, including liver damage, if it’s taken in excess of recommended doses, or in combination with other drugs. ""Severe damage could occur if people take more than 4 grams of acetaminophen in 24 hours,"" Dr. Ke-Qin Hu, a liver disease specialist at the University of California, Irvine, said in a post about the drug. Even less can cause problems if the medicine is taken with alcohol, he added. But the Instagram post doesn’t include any caveats about dosage in declaring Tylenol ""the worst thing you can use."" An Instagram post claims that Tylenol ruins people’s ability to fight off COVID-19. There’s no evidence that Tylenol does that. Health officials have recommended the use of Tylenol and other fever-lowering medications to treat COVID-19 symptoms. Sometimes people can let a fever run its course, medical experts said, but doing so can be dangerous in certain situations.  Tylenol can have serious side effects when taken in excess of recommended doses. But the post doesn’t mention dosage. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2022/jan/05/instagram-posts/no-tylenol-doesnt-ruin-your-ability-fight-covid-19/

""Taft knew that no one seriously questioned that judges ‘should be independent in their judgements.’ Decisional independence is essential to due process, promoting impartial decision-making, free from political or other extraneous influence. But Taft recognized that courts also require ample institutional independence. The judiciary’s power to manage its internal affairs insulate courts from inappropriate political influence and is crucial to preserving public trust in its work as a separate and co-equal branch of government."" (Emphasis ours.)  Nowhere in the report does Roberts criticize the Supreme Court for ""inappropriate political influence.""

Old video clip of Pfizer CEO is not referring to microchips in COVID-19 treatment
","Attempts to corral the COVID-19 pandemic have ranged from testing to vaccines and now to newly approved treatments — and every step of the way, false claims about microchipping have followed. An article published Jan. 2, 2022, was headlined, ""Pfizer CEO: New Pill Will Have a Microchip That Transmits Info Once You Swallow It!"" The article, published on a website called We Love Trump, was shared on Facebook and was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Think that sounds crazy? Here is Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla live on video telling you all about it."" However, the video referenced in the story is of Bourla speaking at a World Economic Forum event in January 2018, two years before the COVID-19 pandemic began. He was talking about a drug that had just been approved for treating schizophrenia. In the video, around the 45:27 mark a participant asked the CEO about technology to engage patients who don’t take the medicines they’re supposed to. Bourla answered, ""I think it’s fascinating what’s happening in this field right now. FDA approved the first electronic pill, if I can call it like that."" Bourla then gave a description matching a pill called Abilify MyCite that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November 2017. The pill contained ​​a sensor that could be used to monitor whether the medication was taken. The headline on the Jan. 2 article refers to Pfizer’s ""new pill."" Though the article does not say what this ""new pill"" is, the timing and use of the term ""vaccine passports"" in the headline suggests it’s about a COVID-19-related drug. In December, the FDA approved Pfizer’s new oral antiviral medication, Paxlovid, for at-home treatment of COVID-19. But there is no evidence that Paxlovid contains a microchip, based on media and company reports. The We Love Trump site mentioned the same video clip of Bourla in a different article on Dec. 17, and in that story accurately reported that the video clip was from 2018. The headline on an article shared on Facebook says, ""Pfizer CEO: New Pill Will Have a Microchip That Transmits Info Once You Swallow It!"" The article cites a video of Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla speaking at an event about sensors in pills. But the video was from 2018, about two years before the COVID-19 pandemic. Bourla was talking about a drug that had been approved two months earlier for treating schizophrenia, not any COVID-19 treatment.

Biden’s ‘no federal solution’ clip doesn’t save Trump PAC’s attack on Biden and COVID-19 plan
","Donald Trump’s political action committee uses an ad peppered with Joe Biden sound bites to claim that Biden never had a plan to tackle the pandemic. It’s a curious attack. Many Republicans, including supporters of the former president, complain that COVID-19 plans carried out by Biden have gone too far. At the same time, Biden did make a comment over the holidays about there being ""no federal solution."" But Trump’s Save America PAC took Biden’s remark out of context. A post sharing the ad was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Save America was formed a week after Election Day in November 2020. It is a leadership PAC, which politicians typically use to support or oppose other candidates.  Save America had $90 million in cash on hand as of June 30, according to its latest report to the Federal Election Commission. It spent over $1.4 million on Facebook and Google fundraising ads since March, ""more than many marquee 2022 campaigns,"" the elections newsletter FWIW reported Dec. 3. Save America and Trump are active in 2022 races. They are supporting, for example, Republican Kelly Tshibaka, who is seeking to unseat Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. Murkowski voted to convict Trump in his impeachment trial after the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Save America’s 30-second video consists of a series of Biden sound bites. In the first half of the ad, the word ""THEN"" appears in a corner of the screen as six clips are played.  Five of the clips are comments Biden made in late October 2020, near the end of his presidential campaign against Trump; and one was made five in January 2021, five days after he took office, our research found.  There’s repetition in what Biden says: ""I am going to shut down the virus.""  ""I’m going to shut down the virus.""  ""I’ll put a plan in place to deal with this pandemic responsibly."" ""I’m going to shut down the virus, not the country."" ""I’m going to shut down the virus."" ""I’m going to shut down the virus."" As the second half of the video begins, the word ""NOW"" appears in a corner of the screen. Only one clip is shown, twice. Biden says, as the words appear in capital letters on the screen: ""Look, there is no federal solution.""  The video ends with this message on this screen: ""Biden never had a covid plan.""  Biden is shown holding an umbrella and walking away from the camera. What the ad presents as its ""gotcha"" moment occurred during a Dec. 27 conference call between Biden and governors about COVID-19. Gov. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., expressed concerns to Biden about testing. Here was their exchange: Hutchinson: ""But we also, as governors, are getting pressure to do more, and the need is great to do more in terms of the rapid tests and the availability of it. And so, one word of concern or encouragement for your team is that as you look towards federal solutions that will help alleviate the challenge, make sure that we do not let federal solutions stand in the way of state solutions. And the production of 500 million rapid tests that will be distributed by the federal government is great but, obviously, that dries up the supply chain for the solutions that we might offer as governor ...."" Biden: ""Thank you very much, Asa. Look, there is no federal solution; this gets solved at a state level. I’m looking at (New Hampshire) Governor (Chris) Sununu on the board here; he talks about that a lot. And then it ultimately gets down to where the rubber meets the road, and that’s where the patient is in need of help or preventing the need for help."" Critics might argue that Biden’s pandemic plan has not been adequate — but he had one, as a candidate and as president. Among the actions he’s taken: On Inauguration Day, Biden signed several executive orders, including one that created a new position within the Executive Office of the President of COVID-19 response coordinator; and one requiring mask-wearing on planes, trains, buses and ships. The White House also released a 198-page national COVID-19 response plan. By June, new COVID-19 cases dropped by 95%, largely due to a rollout of vaccines under Biden. In September, after the delta variant caused a new surge in cases, Biden announced a six-part plan. And in December, he announced a plan that included vaccine boosters and in-home testing.  A Republican National Committee tweet sharing the ""no federal solution"" clip gained more than 909,000 views. Save America PAC did not reply to our requests for information to back its claim.  An ad from the Trump-aligned Save America PAC claimed that ""Biden never had a plan"" for COVID-19. The ad seized on a recent Biden remark about the pandemic that ""there is no federal solution."" Biden’s comment was in the context that the fight is not merely a federal one, but is carried out at the state and local levels, as well. Moreover, as a candidate and as president, Biden has advanced a number of plans to counter the virus. We rate the claim False.

Claim about omicron risk for the vaccinated is missing key context
","Recent data from the United Kingdom’s Office for National Statistics showed that infected people who had been fully vaccinated and had a booster shot were more likely to test positive for the omicron variant of COVID-19 than were unvaccinated people. But those statistics were shared on social media without some key context, and with a post falsely suggesting that it’s safer not to get vaccinated against COVID-19. A Facebook post reads, ""It feels amazing to know I’m 4.5 times LESS LIKELY to catch #Omicron than a boosted Fauci-ite. Can’t wait to see how the media spins this information. It is preliminary but seems like there’s an inverse relationship between number of vaccinations and chances of infection."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post shares a screenshot of a graphic from an article in The Daily Skeptic. The data from the U.K. statistics agency used in that article looked at those in the population with a positive COVID-19 test result, then those ""were then looked at to see which characteristics of that population were associated with omicron,"" Jonathan Cooke of the ONS wrote in an email to PolitiFact. The analysis did show that COVID-19-infected people who had received three doses of a vaccine were 4.5 times more likely to have a positive test compatible with omicron compared with an unvaccinated person who tested positive for COVID-19, Cooke said. It’s worth noting that the U.K. studies compared populations of people who had tested positive for COVID-19. Those who didn’t contract omicron would have been infected by another variant, possibly one associated with more serious health effects.  An ONS statement on the analysis said, ""It is too early to draw conclusions from our data on the effectiveness of vaccines against the omicron variant.""  In addition, unvaccinated people are still more likely to catch COVID-19 and have worse outcomes than the fully vaccinated. The U.K. analysis showed 1,816 people testing positive for COVID-19 between Nov. 29 and Dec. 12, with 115 of those 1,816 cases compatible with omicron. People with three vaccine shots accounted for a total of 185 COVID-19 infections, 21 of which were omicron. Unvaccinated people had a total of 536 infections, 14 with the omicron variant. Based on its modeling technique, the agency said fully vaccinated and boosted people who tested positive for COVID-19 were 4.5 times more likely to be infected with the omicron variant than unvaccinated people. A more recent release by ONS from Dec. 3 through Dec. 16 shows the ratio growing to six times.  But, again, that doesn’t mean the unvaccinated didn’t get COVID-19. According to the study, they simply tested positive for a variant of the virus other than omicron. In both analyses, unvaccinated people were more likely to get any variant of COVID-19 than people with three shots, the statistics agency said. In the later period, where there were 2,091 positive cases, there were 262 COVID-19 infections among people with three shots and 99 omicron cases out of those. Unvaccinated people had 559 infections, with 47 being from omicron. ""Our statement on the analysis did make clear, using analysis from our recent characteristics release, that unvaccinated people overall are more likely to test positive for COVID-19, regardless of variant,"" said Cooke.  Reuters fact-checkers found similar posts shared by users on social media also were missing that key context. As in the rest of the world, the omicron variant is spreading rapidly across all U.K. regions, according to ONS data and the UK Health Security Agency, and is now the dominant strain in the U.K. The U.K. set a daily record with 189,846 new COVID-19 infections of any kind on Dec. 31. The UK Health Security Agency said studies using data through Dec. 29 show there is a roughly 50% lower risk of hospitalization for those infected with the omicron variant, compared with the delta variant.  People who are fully vaccinated and boosted who get the omicron variant are 81% less likely to be admitted to a hospital than those who are unvaccinated, the agency said. The studies also show the vaccines have waning effectiveness over time in preventing an omicron infection. Preliminary studies from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and the Imperial College of London also showed significantly lower risk of hospitalization from omicron than delta. A Facebook post with a graphic claimed that people fully vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19 were 4.5 times more likely than unvaccinated people to catch the omicron variant. The post gives the false impression that unvaccinated people are better protected against COVID-19. The ratio comes from statistics published by the UK’s Office for National Statistics, and it rose to 6 times more likely in more recent data.  However, the Facebook post leaves out key context that is included in the ONS report and in the Daily Skeptic article the graphic posted on Facebook comes from. The agency’s analysis compared people who had tested positive for COVID-19, meaning that those who didn’t contract omicron were infected with another variant, possibly a more dangerous one.  The ONS report clearly states that unvaccinated people are more likely to contract COVID-19 of any strain and that it is too early to draw conclusions from the data about vaccine effectiveness. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

""When comparing Biden to his predecessor, the latest number is just below the highest approval rating (44%) Donald Trump received in our polls during his four years in office,"" the Marist Poll said then.

W. Bush and George W. Bush all had approval ratings below 30%.  RELATED VIDEO  In October, CNN used the Gallup data to conclude that Biden had the second-lowest approval rating of any president that Gallup had measured at that moment in their presidency, about nine months into their term. Trump had a lower rating — 37%.

Danish study shows decline in vaccine protection against omicron is restored with Pfizer booster
","A recent study from Denmark on the Pfizer and Moderna two-dose vaccines showed a sharp and quick decline in their effectiveness against the omicron variant of COVID-19. But some social media posts and articles are misrepresenting what the study shows, its authors said. An Instagram post by Teens Against Mandates shows a headline that reads ""Yale study: Vaccinated people more likely to be infected than those without the jab"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

That article links to a study posted on medRxiv.org, a site that allows users to post preprints of unpublished manuscripts that have not been peer reviewed. The headline calling it a ""Yale study"" is not correct. MedRxiv was founded by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Yale University and BMJ, a medical research site for health care providers. The site states that ""no endorsement of a manuscript’s methods, assumptions, conclusions, or scientific quality"" is implied by the laboratory, Yale or BMJ. The study was conducted by researchers on the Infectious Disease Preparedness Group at Denmark’s Statens Serum Institut, which states on its website that it’s ""responsible for the Danish preparedness against infectious diseases."" The headline also misrepresents the study’s findings. Nowhere does it suggest that vaccinated people are more likely to be infected than unvaccinated people. ""Interpretation that our research is evidence of anything but a protective vaccine effect is misrepresentative,"" Astrid Blicher Schelde, one of the study’s authors wrote in an email to PolitiFact.  The study measures the effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines against the omicron and delta variants in Danish residents up to five months after a primary vaccine series and uses data from Nov. 20 through Dec. 12, about the time the omicron variant was first reported by researchers in South Africa. The authors wrote that the study showed vaccine effectiveness against both variants after two doses, though they were each more effective against delta. It also found that the vaccine effectiveness declined rapidly against both variants after several months, but that it was restored after a Pfizer booster dose. ""In light of the exponential rise in Omicron cases, these findings highlight the need for massive rollout of vaccinations and booster vaccinations,"" they wrote. The Pfizer vaccine was 55.2% effective against omicron in the first 30 days after two doses, but that dropped to -76.5% after 90 days, the study found. The Moderna vaccine also showed a steep drop in effectiveness from 36.7% to -39.3% in the same time period. A Pfizer booster restored vaccine effectiveness to 54.6%, but there was not enough data on a Moderna booster, the researchers said. The Rogue Review story pointed to the two negative numbers, and said these figures show that those vaccinated with Pfizer are 76.5% more likely to get omicron than the unvaccinated, and that Moderna vaccine recipients are 39.3% more likely to get omicron than the unvaccinated. That’s not what the study concluded. In the discussion section of the study, the authors explained that the negative numbers suggest that different behavior ""and/or exposure patterns in the vaccinated and unvaccinated"" caused underestimation of the vaccines’ effectiveness. ""This was likely the result of omicron spreading rapidly initially through single (super-spreading) events causing many infections among young, vaccinated individuals,"" they wrote. Blicher Schelde said there are several reasons why the number might be negative. First, vaccinated people may test more than unvaccinated people, she said. Also, the data is from the first generations of omicron cases in Denmark, which occurred disproportionately among those who were traveling internationally and people in their social and professional circles who were largely vaccinated, she said. Therefore, there was likely an overrepresentation of vaccinated people. Finally, discrepancies in risk behavior between vaccinated and unvaccinated people will lead to an underestimate of vaccine effectiveness, she wrote, pointing out that the ""increasingly small cohort of unvaccinated people"" in Denmark may take extra precautions because they are not vaccinated. In Denmark, 78.4% of the population have received two doses of a vaccine and 49.5% have received a booster dose, as of Jan. 4. ""To conclude, the vaccines’ protective effect may be low against infection with omicron after four months, but it is most unlikely to be negative,"" Blicher Schelde wrote. Fact checkers from Lead Stories and Reuters also disputed similar claims about the Danish study. An Instagram post claimed that a Yale study showed that vaccinated people are more likely to be infected with omicron than people who are not vaccinated. The claim misrepresents the source and findings of the study. It was done by Danish researchers at the Statens Serum Institut, not by Yale researchers.  The study shows a sharp decline in vaccine effectiveness against omicron over time in people who have received two doses. It also shows that effectiveness is restored with a booster dose of Pfizer, although there is not enough data on a Moderna booster. The authors said the study did not conclude that vaccinated people are more likely to be infected with omicron than people who are not vaccinated. They said their findings prove the need for more vaccinations and booster doses to combat the rapid rise of omicron.

False claims about Jan. 6 insurrection and 2020 presidential election rely on debunked information
","As the one-year anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection approaches, false claims continue to attempt to recast that day’s events and question the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Politicians and media personalities have gone to great lengths to try to reframe the events of Jan. 6 — efforts so extensive that PolitiFact chose lies about the Capitol attack and its significance as the 2021 Lie of the Year. Despite the efforts to downplay that day, Jan. 6 was an insurrection, with dozens of rioters armed with real and makeshift weapons trying to overturn the election. Extensive evidence includes video documentation and many eyewitness accounts. On the flip side, the 2020 presidential election was not an insurrection. Joe Biden was legally elected president. Late-night spikes in voting results reflected the effort to count unprecedented numbers of mail-in ballots, and are not proof of election fraud. The idea that the election was the ""real"" insurrection originated with former President Donald Trump, who first said it in early October. Then, on Oct. 21, Trump issued a statement that said, ""The insurrection took place on November 3, Election Day. January 6 was the Protest!"" The Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol was not a protest; it was a historic attempt to subvert the results of an election. ""Never before had Americans overtaken the Capitol to hold up electoral proceedings and threaten lawmakers,"" PolitiFact reported. The 2020 presidential election was the focus of the insurrection and also at the center of a multitude of false claims. But there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud, and dozens of lawsuits seeking to overturn the election failed. Every state certified its results, and Biden won both the Electoral College and the popular vote. The Facebook claim does not specify what occurred at 3 a.m. on Nov. 4. It could be a reference to false claims that surfaced in November 2020 that more than a million ballots with votes cast for Biden were ""found"" in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in the middle of the night following the election. The claims were a misinterpretation of how mail-in ballots are counted, PolitiFact reported, and the numbers of ballots cited in such claims were exaggerated or incorrect. For example, in Wisconsin, election officials worked through the night following the election ""to tally the unprecedented numbers of mail-in ballots, which under state law they were not allowed to start counting until Election Day,"" PolitiFact reported. And in Pennsylvania, there were no credible reports of 1 million mail-in ballots discovered in the night or at any time.

Wisconsin Republican candidate mostly wrong on numbers of Americans left behind in Afghanistan
","The United States’ withdrawal from Afghanistan remains a fixture of retired U.S. Navy SEAL Derrick Van Orden’s campaign for Wisconsin’s Third District congressional seat.  Since last summer’s chaotic exit from the nation’s longest war, Van Orden has repeatedly criticized President Joe Biden for the number of American citizens left in the country. Here’s how he framed it in a Dec. 7, 2021 tweet: ""(President Joe Biden) abandoned 1000’s of our fellow American citizens to their fate w/ the Taliban & imported 10’s of 1000’s of random people from a country that we fought in for over 20 years.""  That echoed a Sept. 29, 2021 tweet that claimed, in part: ""When officers do enlisted math. 10,000 - 15,000 American citizens abandoned to terrorists in Afghanistan. 6000 - pulled from the country. Equals - ‘less than 100’ "" The ""less than 100,"" of course, is a reference to official tallies at the time of the Aug. 31, 2021 deadline of Americans who were not evacuated. For purposes of this factcheck, we are going to focus on the claim that actions by Biden left ""10,000 - 15,000 American citizens abandoned to terrorists in Afghanistan."" Is he right?  Not exactly, since those Van Orden classifies as ""abandoned"" did not necessarily want to leave. Indeed, some have dual citizenship, between the U.S. and Afghanistan.  There are some key factors involved in counting Americans in Afghanistan, or any foreign country for that matter. First, registering with the U.S. State Department, through an embassy, is not required. Second, in many cases individuals may have dual citizenship. And, in this case, officials say not every American in Afghanistan wanted to leave. When the evacuation of Afghanistan began, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin wrote in an Aug. 17, 2021, letter to Congress that there were as many as 15,000 Americans in the country needing evacuation. Blinken then told reporters on Aug. 25, 2021, that the number of American citizens who wanted to leave was closer to about 6,000. According to an Aug. 29, 2021 Washington Post analysis of those figures, the State Department started its initial figure of 15,000 citizens based on the known number of Americans in the country and assumed given the Taliban’s pending takeover many would need evacuation.  The second number of 6,000 came after State Department officials and embassy workers had heard from people who wished to leave the country.  So Van Orden may use the correct numbers in making the claim, but he misleads in assuming the estimated 9,000 Americans remaining in Afghanistan wanted to leave in the first place.  When we asked Van Orden for backup, spokesman Justin Giorgio said the candidate’s broader point was about how the Biden Administration’s figure of exactly how many more Americans needed to be evacuated kept changing, more so than how some chose to leave after the Aug. 31 deadline. But that was not how it was stated. In any case, we dug a little further. On Sept. 13, 2021, Blinken told Congress that fewer than 100 American citizens who wished to be evacuated remained inside the country, according to a report that day from NBC News. Other news outlets reported the number of Americans left in Afghanistan was between 100 and 200.  Since that point, as conditions in Afghanistan have worsened, the number of Americans seeking to leave has increased. Thus, the number of those ""left"" is constantly changing. In all, the federal government has helped 479 American citizens and 450 permanent residents leave Afghanistan for the United States since the Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline, according to a Dec. 13, 2021, news release from the State Department.  Jen Psaki, Biden’s press secretary, told reporters on Dec. 14, 2021, many of those evacuated since the withdrawal deadline had initially decided not to leave.  ""There were people who wanted — determined they wanted to leave since then, and it is our responsibility to help them depart. So that’s evidence of our commitment to do exactly that,"" she  said, according to a White House readout of the media briefing.  Psaki and the State Department said at the time that about a dozen Americans were awaiting evacuation from the country.  The figures he uses are real, but they are dramatically mischaracterized – particularly with the use of the word ""abandoned.""  The State Department’s initial estimate included thousands who have dual citizenship. And even using a whittled-back number would suggest that every one of those individuals wants to leave. After the August 31 withdrawal deadline, about 100 Americans remained who wished to be evacuated. Since then, the US has helped 479 American citizens and 450 permanent residents leave Afghanistan. As of mid-December, officials said, about a dozen were seeking help in leaving the country. Our definition of Mostly False is a statement that ""contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""

Measles can live up to 2 hours on a surface or in the air, CDC warns
","The paid medical experts of TV channels are seeing a lot of time on the airwaves lately as they diagnose the country’s measles flare-up. It wasn’t too long ago that they were explaining risks of the Ebola virus killing thousands of Western Africans and the chances it could spread throughout the United States. This time around, the health pundits have spent considerable time spelling out the differences between the two scary diseases. Ebola, which has a low risk of spreading through the United States, is passed through direct contact with bodily fluids and not through the air. Measles, which was eliminated from the United States in 2000 due to wide vaccination, is a very different virus, explained CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. Unlike Ebola, ""you don’t need to be that close to someone or kiss someone or anything like that"" to pass it around. ""It’s airborne,"" she told Anderson Cooper on Feb. 2. ""If someone is in a room that has measles and leaves and you walk in two hours later, you could get measles from that person."" We thought her example sounded alarming. So, after checking our personal immunization histories, we decided to fact-check her statement. We didn’t hear back from Cohen when we reached out to CNN, but we found information from a reliable source that backs up her scenario. Her example is nearly exactly the transmission description for measles from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The measles virus stays in the nose and throat mucus of someone who has the infection, so it makes sense that it is passed around through coughing and sneezing. ""Also, measles virus can live for up to two hours on a surface or in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed,"" the CDC says. ""If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected."" Physicians encourage the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine because it is very effective in preventing the virus from entering the body (and as we found, the science is certain that it is safe). The disease is so easy to catch, the CDC says, that if one person catches it, a whopping 90 percent of people who are not immune (i.e. did not have the vaccine due to a weak immune system, age or personal choice) close to the infected person will also become infected. We can compare the contagion of each disease by examining the basic reproductive number, known as the R0. This refers to the average number of secondary infection cases stemming from one infected person in a ""completely susceptible"" uninfected population (if the population is vaccinated for, say, measles, the R0 basically disappears). As the R0 increases above 1, the disease spreads more widely. The R0 of Ebola is around 2, meaning an average of two people catch the disease from one infected person during an outbreak. The measles has a much higher R0 of 18, higher than AIDS (R0 of 4), SARS (R0 of 4), or mumps (R0 of 10). NPR’s Shots blog has a great chart breaking down this concept. Put another way, ""Ebola's got nothing"" on the measles epidemic, wrote Dr. Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center, in a recent Houston Chronicle opinion-editorial. ""Just being in the room where someone with measles has been 30 minutes earlier can expose you,"" Troisi wrote. Troisi confirmed the accuracy of Cohen’s statement. When we asked about the discrepancy between her 30-minute window and Cohen’s two-hour window, she directed us to the CDC’s website and called her estimate ""conservative."" Our ruling Cohen said, ""If someone is in a room that has measles and leaves and you walk in two hours later, you could get measles from that person."" She is right. Measles is a highly contagious airborne disease, and the CDC gives this exact timeframe on its website.

Is measles a leading cause of child blindness around the world?
","An assertion from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., that vaccinations are about freedom and should be left to parental choice spawned a raft of reaction from the pundit and political world. One claim we heard a lot is Paul should know better. After all, he is an eye surgeon. In an interview on CNBC on Feb. 2, 2015, Paul hailed vaccines as a medical triumph but said he sees the controversy of whether it should be mandatory as an ""issue of freedom."" Further, he said he heard of many ""tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines."" Dr. Celine Gounder, a physician who frequently appears on news channels to analyze health news, addressed his comments on CNN Newsroom the following day.  ""Frankly, Rand Paul as an ophthalmologist should be out there saying measles is one of the most common causes of child blindness worldwide,"" Gounder said. ""And as an eye doctor, he should be advocating for measles vaccination for that reason."" Gounder’s claim, as it relates to Paul’s life as an eye surgeon, got our attention. And it’s correct. Gounder’s point is backed up by sources such as the World Health Organization and a host of academic studies and review papers that she sent us. ‘Worldwide’ is key  Conjunctivitis, or pink eye, is a common side effect of a measles infection. ""Whoever you are, wherever you are,"" people with measles can’t stand bright sunlight, said Dr. James Cherry, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. But for children in poor countries, eye damage from measles can be much worse. Blindness by measles in children is not common across North America and Europe, areas with high vaccination rates and access. The leading causes of blindness in those continents are lesions of the optic nerve, according to the WHO. In low-income countries, where access to vaccines that prevent measles is limited and malnutrition is prevalent, corneal scarring from measles and a deficiency of vitamin A are the major causes. In the United States, based on the most recent CDC data from more than 20 years ago, the leading complication (and complications from measles of any sort in the U.S. are not common) was diarrhea followed by middle ear inflammation and pneumonia. ""In the U.S., children could potentially develop eye problems during an episode of measles if they are malnourished,"" said Dr. Richard Semba, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine ophthalmology professor. ""This would probably be rare."" Vitamin A is important for eyes to function as they should, as well as for the body’s immune system and growth. If your teacher or mom didn’t tell you, the vitamin is found in eggs, whole milk, butter and liver, as well as leafy green vegetables and red, orange and yellow fruits. Measles is most common in countries of sub-Saharan Africa, southeast Asia and south Asia, together home to 85 percent of all blind children. In these places, measles is endemic, according to a 2004 review paper by Semba. That paper found measles blindness accounted for anywhere from 15,000 to 60,000 cases of child blindness per year. Here's how Semba explained blindness happening from contracting the highly contagious measles virus: The cornea, the front transparent layer of the eye, requires vitamin A to work. The retina, which is the back layer of the eye that receives visual images (like the film in a camera), requires vitamin A in order to allow us to see at night. A measles infection can reduce the levels of vitamin A that the body needs for normal health. As a result, during a measles episode, a child can develop ulcers in the cornea during a measles episode that makes it hard to see at night. The end result is ""a devastating loss of vision and blindness,"" Semba said. Dryness in corneas can result in night blindness, corneal ulceration, scarring and resulting blindness, studies show. Countries with vaccination programs for measles have reduced the problem of widespread eye disease, according to WHO. The organization also recommends that children in developing countries who contract measles receive two doses of vitamin A supplements a day apart. ""Vitamin A supplements have been shown to reduce the number of deaths from measles by 50 percent,"" WHO says. Paul’s spokesman sent us a link to a New York Times reporter’s account of watching Paul get his Hepatitis A booster shot Feb. 3, 2015, but did not answer our questions. Our ruling Gounder suggested Paul should be singing a different tune about vaccinations, one that mentions, ""Measles is one of the most common causes of child blindness worldwide."" She was careful to say worldwide. In developed countries, measles does not typically lead to blindness. But in low-income countries, it is certainly one of the leading drivers of blindness in children, experts agree.

Did Scott Walker flip-flop on a immigration and a pathway to citizenship?
","Editor's note: We rated this a Half Flip on Feb. 4, 2015 based on Gov. Walker's statements to date at that time. Subsequently, the governor disavowed his previous endorsement of a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. We revisted his position in an item published March 6, 2015, with a new ruling of Full Flop.    The left-wing group Media Matters for America cried flip-flop after Gov. Scott Walker bluntly told ABC News he opposed ""amnesty"" for illegal immigrants living in the United States. Walker, the group said in blog post, previously had supported a pathway to citizenship advocated by lawmakers in Washington, D.C. With Walker garnering plenty of attention amid a crowded field of potential 2016 GOP presidential candidates, let’s put this one to the Flip-O-Meter. Our standard disclaimer applies: The Flip-O-Meter is not designed to say whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. Rather, it strictly looks at whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views on a topic. In this case, we have visited Walker’s statements on immigration before, notably in August 2013, when we examined how Republicans were framing the issue in the wake of President Barack Obama’s re-election win with strong support from Hispanics. In the past, Walker has been hard to pin down on the question, and has made seemingly contradictory statements. So we were struck by Walker’s direct language and tone Feb. 1, 2015 in the ""This Week"" interview with ABC’s Martha Raddatz. Raddatz: ""We know you want to fix the border and fix the immigration system, but what would you do about the 11 million undocumented who are still here? Walker: ""I think for sure, we need to secure the border. I think we need to enforce the legal system. I'm not for amnesty…"" In making the comments, did Walker change his position? Here are some key past statements he’s made, all in 2013: -- At a February 2013 national conference hosted by Politico, Walker said fixing the legal immigration system should come first, but said the next step is we ""gotta embrace"" a ""legal pathway"" for those here unlawfully. He did not elaborate on what he meant. -- In a July 2013 interview with Wausau (Wis.) Daily Herald staffers, Walker said ""it makes sense"" that people could not only stay here but get citizenship with the right mix of penalties and waiting periods and other requirements. -- In 2013 and later, Walker didn’t endorse any specific bill in Congress that would have allowed illegal immigrants to stay here. But at the Politico conference, he didn’t dismiss legislative action if some ""nuances"" were addressed. -- At that conference he flatly opposed deporting people who are here unlawfully, saying ""you’ve got to find a way to make it legally possible for people moving forward."" Soon after Walker’s reported comments sympathetic to some kind of path to citizenship made headlines, he started to walk back the idea he had supported such a thing. His spokesman told us in August 2013 that Walker had endorsed no specific policy or bill. And Walker said in November 2013 on MSNBC’s Morning Joe that he had not meant to back a pathway. Now let’s revisit the recent ABC interview in more depth. In that interview, Walker also said, ""I’m not an advocate of the plans that have been pushed here in Washington"" to allow those here to remain. That’s arguably more dismissive than he’s been before. But Walker added that he would roll out a plan of his own to address the issue. And he tossed in what sounded like softening remarks, saying ""we’ve got to have a healthy balance. We’re a country both of immigrants and of laws. We can’t ignore the laws in this country, can't ignore the people who come in, whether it’s from Mexico or Central America."" Finally, Walker told Raddatz he was not advocating deporting the estimated 11 million undocumented residents in the country. He summed up his position this way: ""I am saying in the end, we need to enforce the laws in the United States, and we need to find a way for people to have a legitimate legal immigration system in this country, and that does not mean amnesty."" What to make of Walker’s remarks? Walker campaign spokesman Tom Evenson said they were consistent with his past comments on what to do with those living here illegally. Walker does not consider the penalty-laden pathway to legal status that he endorsed in 2013 ""amnesty,"" and he’s not advocating amnesty now, he said. For help, we turned to two groups advocating on this issue. An advocate with a group that backs a path to citizenship agreed Walker’s comments were vague, but detected a change in his words and actions. Lynn Tramonte, deputy director of America’s Voice, noted Walker said nothing in the spirit of his 2013 comments on finding a way, eventually, to allow people to stay. His goal ""is to be as vague as possible so that he can court hard-right anti-immigrant voters while remaining viable in the general election,"" she said. Tramonte said Walker has indirectly backed deportations by joining a lawsuit challenging President Obama’s authority to issue a November 2014 executive order on immigration. That order protected from deportation some 4.1 million parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents who have lived in the U.S. for at least five years, and hundreds of thousands more young people. We also spoke with Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). The group is a leading critic of legalizing the status of people who jumped the line to get in. Walker’s description of his views as anti-amnesty doesn’t necessarily mean much, Mehlman said. Republicans, even if they want to find a way to let illegal immigrants remain here, reject the ""amnesty"" label for political reasons, he said. On the substance of Walker’s remarks, Mehlman said that, coming in such a brief exchange, Walker’s comments were too cryptic to really evaluate his position. Mehlman’s view: Walker really hasn’t backed away from his 2013 statements, so in they eyes of FAIR, he still supports what some might term amnesty. ""Politicians from both parties who support granting legal status to millions of illegal aliens go to great pains to define what they support as something other than amnesty,"" he said. Our rating We don’t see a Full Flop by Walker here. Walker didn’t directly disavow his 2013 remarks -- or repeat them for that matter. And the truth is that we don’t really know whether he has a completely new position, because he wasn’t asked to clarify his views in detail. All we know is he’s not going to call his plan ""amnesty"" when it comes out. We do see inconsistencies in Walker’s framing of his views and the tone of his remarks as he begins to court conservative GOP primary voters -- including leaving a tough-sounding impression about handling illegal immigrants. On the meter, inconsistent statements or a partial change of position earn a Half Flip. That fits here.  ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.",/factchecks/2015/feb/04/scott-walker/did-scott-walker-flip-flop-pathway-citizenship/

Lopez says Reagan banned machine guns, backed assualt weapons ban
","Del. Alfonso Lopez recently conjured the spirit of Ronald Reagan in an ill-fated attempt to convince the Republican-led House of Delegates to pass gun control legislation. ""In Virginia, we have a bad habit of defeating every single sensible gun violence prevention bill proposal,"" Lopez, D-Arlington, lamented in a Jan. 19 floor speech. ""By the standards of today, Ronald Reagan was a traitor to the Second Amendment,"" Lopez said. The delegate added about Reagan, ""As president, he banned ownership of fully automatic rifles. He supported the assault weapons ban..."" We wondered whether Lopez described the Gipper’s record correctly. We asked the delegate for proof of his claim and he sent an assortment of newspaper articles, two op-ed pieces Reagan wrote after his presidency, and a 2013 Truth-O-Meter by PolitiFact Georgia on a similar claim about Reagan. Let’s start by recalling that Reagan was shot in the chest in a 1981 assassination attempt that left his press secretary, James Brady, with a gunshot wound to the head and permanent brain damage. During the rest of his administration, which ended in 1989, Reagan ""often expressed opposition to national gun control laws,"" according to a 1994 article in The New York Times. Shortly after his shooting, he said he was ""a little disturbed"" that people were ""focusing on gun control as an answer to the crime problem today."" Lopez pointed out to us that in 1986, Reagan signed the Firearm Owners Protection Act. The bill provided a number of protections for gun owners. But it also barred the private sale and ownership of any fully automatic rifles -- machine guns -- that were not already registered with the federal government on the day Reagan signed the law. The provision, still in effect today, is not the outright ban that Lopez described. Private citizens remain free to buy and transfer machine guns that were registered prior to May 20, 1986 -- provided they pass a background check, receive signed approval from their local police chief or sheriff and pay a $200 federal tax. There are 512,790 registered machine guns in the United States, according to a 2014 report by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Virginia was home to 31,825 of them, more than any state. Now, let’s move to the assertion that Reagan also backed a ban on assault weapons, which are often described as semi-automatic firearms with detachable magazines and pistol grips. They are capable of firing many rounds without reloading, but the trigger has to be pulled for each shot. Lopez referred us to a May 1994 letter signed by Reagan and former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter urging members of the U.S. House of Representatives to to support a pending bill banning assault weapons. They wrote, ""While we recognize that assault weapon legislation will not stop all assault weapon crime, statistics prove that we can dry up the supply of these guns, making them less accessible to criminals. We urge you to listen to the American public and to the law enforcement community and support a ban on the further manufacture of these weapons."" Reagan also sent a personal note that month to one of the fence sitters on ban: Rep. Scott Klug, R-WI. ""I know there is heavy pressure on you to go the other way, but I strongly urge you to join me in supporting this bill,"" he wrote. It must be passed."" The measure cleared Congress, with Klug’s support, and was signed by then-President. Bill Clinton. The assault weapons ban expired in 2004 when Congress refused to extend it. We should note that since Lopez’s speech, the General Assembly has killed a number of gun control bills, including legislation by Lopez that would have restricted the sale and ownership of high-capacity firearm magazines. Our ruling Lopez said, ""As president, (Reagan) banned ownership of fully automatic rifles. He supported the assault weapons ban."" Lopez errs in saying Reagan banned ownership of machine guns. Reagan, in 1986, signed a law that barred the private sale and ownership of machine guns that were not already registered on the day he signed the bill. The measure stopped new machine guns from entering the private marketplace, it did not ban the old ones. Lopez is correct on the second part of his claim. In 1994, after his presidency, Reagan signed a letter urging the House to pass an assault weapons ban. On the whole, we rate Lopez’s statement as Half True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/04/alfonso-lopez/lopez-says-reagan-supported-assault-weapon-bans/

Megyn Kelly: Measles vaccine safety is settled science
","As the number of cases of measles slowly grows across the United States, it has revived a past debate over the safety of the vaccine that for decades prevented an outbreak. Potential presidential contenders, including Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, have suggested that parents should be allowed to decline vaccination for their children if they have concerns over side effects. Two Fox News hosts, Bill O’Reilly and Megyn Kelly, tackled the touchy topic of mandatory vaccinations on The O’Reilly Factor on Feb. 2, 2015. Kelly said she had all three of her children vaccinated and that for immunization programs to work, they must be mandatory. Kelly, however, cut some slack for parents who might have decided otherwise a few years ago. ""They were given bad information years ago by a U.K. study that came out in 1998,"" Kelly said. ""Five years ago the science wasn't even as certain as it is today. It is very certain today."" In this fact-check, we take a look at the scientific certainty over the safety of vaccination. Along the way, we’ll see if the science has become even more certain in the past five years. We told Fox News we were digging into this and didn’t hear back, but Kelly’s five-year mark lines up with the formal retraction of that United Kingdom study she mentioned. To quickly recap, in 1998, a British medical journal called the Lancet published a paper by Andrew Wakefield and a dozen colleagues that claimed to show a link between the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and autism. Many parents responded with predictable fear and vaccination rates began falling. The impact was strongest in the United Kingdom where the rate fell from the 90 percent range down to 80 percent. The United States saw a minor dip. In some states, the rate dropped below 90 percent although nationally the rate remained higher. In 2010, roughly five years ago, the Lancet retracted Wakefield’s study. This seems to be the benchmark for Kelly’s comparison. What we heard from the public health community is that not only is the medical science clear today, it was back in 2010 as well. The scientists were sure Dr. Mark Schleiss is director of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at the University of Minnesota Medical School. Schleiss told PunditFact that the science was clear in 2010, and it’s clear today.  ""Wakefield's work had been discredited within a year or two of publication,"" Schleiss said. ""After Wakefield, there were a number of other studies performed, and it was convincingly shown that there was no link with autism, but that safety information was already known well before that."" Schleiss dates efforts to test the safety of childhood immunizations back to the 1980s when there were reports that the whooping cough vaccine caused developmental disorders. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Institute of Medicine (at the time, a division of the National Academy of Sciences) conducted studies and found the whooping cough reports without merit. Along the way, that work also established the safety of the MMR vaccine and would undermine Wakefield’s research in the Lancet. The Wakefield study had such a high profile that it spurred further rounds of research. In 2001, the Institute of Medicine published a report that found no evidence of an association between the vaccine and autism. In 2004, the institute conducted another review. The institute said in a press release, ""14 large epidemiological studies consistently showed no association between the MMR vaccine and autism."" Dr. Marie McCormick, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, oversaw the committee that conducted the 2004 IOM vaccine safety review. McCormick told us that there were no divisions within the scientific community at that time. ""I think that the data were pretty firm as of 2004,"" McCormick said. By 2004, 10 of Wakefield’s co-authors had withdrawn their names from his study. Other things also had happened. Brian Deer, a British journalist, documented shoddy data that underlay the results. Deer also found that Wakefield never disclosed that he had been paid by a lawyer representing some of the children cited in the article. In the British Medical Journal, Deer later exposed how Wakefield engaged in an elaborate scientific fraud. Wakefield sued the British Medical Journal and lost. Editor-in-chief Fiona Godlee told PunditFact that ""the science has been much the same throughout the MMR scare caused by Wakefield's paper."" McCormick said the one thing that did change over the years was the public reporting around the topic. At the height of the scare, McCormick said news coverage suffered from a systematic flaw. ""If a reporter interviewed a scientist about the results, she would almost automatically give equal time and weight to an opponent of vaccines regardless of the validity of their opinion,"" McCormick said. ""Thus, to the viewer or reader, the issue would seem evenly balanced, even when it was not."" Our ruling Kelly said that the science on vaccine safety is certain today. The researchers we contacted said that as far as the science is concerned, certainty had been reached at least 10 years ago with the release of a major national study debunking the link between the measles mumps, rubella vaccine and autism. Five years ago, the British journal the Lancet retracted the original report that triggered the initial wave of fear. That decision was the final nail in the coffin of a discredited report. If anything, Kelly undersold her point about when scientists agreed that vaccination is safe.

Under Common Core, teaching simple addition takes a full minute, Texas governor says 
","Under Common Core, it takes far too long for a teacher to show a student how to do simple addition, said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. In 2013, the Texas Legislature passed a law prohibiting school districts from using Common Core in their lesson plans. On Fox News Sunday, Abbott argued that Common Core -- the proposed set of education standards that has become a political football -- is a bad idea. He directed viewers toward some evidence. ""I hope all your viewers will go to Google and plug in ‘nine plus six Common Core,’ "" he said, telling viewers to find a video on YouTube of a news report out of upstate New York. ""You'll find it's going to take you more than a minute to see how a teacher teaches a student to learn how to add nine plus six. Chris, these are the Common Core standards that are now being pushed down from the top that we must get away from."" In the video, a teacher gives an addition lesson directed at early elementary school-age children. She adds nine and six by first splitting the six into one and five, then adding the one to the nine to make 10. So the problem becomes 10 plus five equals 15. ""Our young learners might not be altogether comfortable thinking about what 9 plus 6 is. They are quite comfortable thinking about their friend 10,"" the teacher says."" Now our students are seeing that we have 10 plus 5…. That is much more comfortable than looking at 9 plus 6."" Responding to Abbott on Fox, former U.S. Secretary of Education Bill Bennett, a conservative supporter of Common Core, said, ""I haven't seen this (video) but I'm going to tell you if it's crazy, it probably isn't Common Core. It's probably one of these myths that's developed,"" and he encouraged viewers to read the Common Core standards for themselves. So we decided to download the video as well as the Common Core standards to find out if this addition strategy is in fact a part of Common Core. It turns out that this method is in line with what the Common Core standards drafters had in mind, but it’s not a bizarre concept, as Abbott implies. Math teachers have been using methods like this for decades. The standards First, let’s clarify a couple things. Abbott said these standards are being pushed down ""from the top"" -- meaning the federal level. Common Core is not a federal mandate -- adopting these standards is voluntary for states (though they can have better access to federal education money if they take them on). Additionally, Common Core does not prescribe or require any particular method of teaching. Nowhere in the standards does it say that teachers must teach addition by first splitting numbers up to create 10. Common Core standards, rather, identify concepts that students should learn at each grade level -- not how teachers should teach them. That being said, the standards do suggest that teachers use methods similar to that used in the video to teach first-graders how to add and subtract within the number 20. It suggests: ""Use strategies such as counting on; making ten (e.g., 8 + 6 = 8 + 2 + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14); decomposing a number leading to a ten (e.g., 13 – 4 = 13 – 3 – 1 = 10 – 1 = 9)... and creating equivalent but easier or known sums (e.g., adding 6 + 7 by creating the known equivalent 6 + 6 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13)."" Math education experts told us that the method used in the video are in line with the Common Core standards’ intention -- which is to teach children foundational math strategies that they can use for more sophisticated problems down the line. Although it does take the teacher in the video just under a minute to teach the equation, it’s not as if the teacher has to go through those motions for every single addition problem. She’s teaching a strategy that students can apply to other problems on their own. ""What Gov. Abbott is missing is that the teacher in the video is doing much more than teaching a fact,"" said Valerie Mills, president of the National Council of Supervisors of Mathematics. ""She is helping students to build an understanding of operations (addition in this case) and of how our number system works."" That way, when a child is older and has to add larger numbers, they can use the strategy to add quickly. (For example 149 plus 236 becomes 150 plus 235 to make 385.) It’s also worth noting that one of the reporters in the video says, ""When you and I were in school, we used to memorize that nine plus six is 15. Not anymore."" That’s actually not the case. By second grade, according to the Common Core standards, students are expected to have these facts memorized, after they learn the foundations of how to add in first grade. How different is this? Abbott makes it seem like this way of teaching addition is a deviation from what schools already do. Diane Briars, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, said teachers have used techniques like splitting a number into parts of 10 for addition -- rather than straight memorization -- since the 1950s at least, and the research showing its benefits goes back to the 1920s. She sent us pages in a textbook from the 1990s that includes the method from the video. ""It has long been best practice for early childhood math,"" Briars said. In fact, they match up with Texas’ state standards for first-grade math, said William McCallum, a University of Arizona math professor who was involved in drafting the Common Core standards. The Texas standards say for first-graders: ""Students extend their use of addition and subtraction beyond the actions of joining and separating to include comparing and combining. Students use properties of operations and the relationship between addition and subtraction to solve problems.""  And, more explicitly, students are expected to ""apply basic fact strategies to add and subtract within 20, including making 10 and decomposing a number leading to a 10."" ""The general belief is that the Texas state standards are modeled word for word on the Common Core state standards,"" Mills said. Although these ideas have been around for so long, that doesn’t mean that all parents necessarily learned with these methods, which might be why they perceive Common Core standards as something foreign, Mills added. ""I can see why the governor would watch that video and say ‘oh my gosh,’ "" she said. Our ruling Abbott said that under Common Core standards, it takes ""more than a minute"" to teach a student ""how to add nine plus six."" There is a video that shows a teacher demonstrating how to add nine plus six to make 15, and it takes just under a minute. But the method she uses is not explicitly required by the Common Core standards, though the standards suggest this approach for teaching addition to first-graders. Abbott’s claim is misleading, though, in that it implies that this method takes an unusually long time or teaches something in a new way. These methods have been around for years and pre-date Common Core. In fact, they align with Texas’ own state standards. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/03/greg-abbott/under-common-core-teaching-simple-addition-takes-f/

What CDC statistics say about vaccine-related illnesses, injuries and death
","In a debate on CNN, a pediatrician who lends a sympathetic ear to the anti-vaccine movement described what he said was one of the risks of vaccinating children. ""Every year in the United States between 3,000 and 4,500 severe vaccine reactions are reported to the Centers for Disease Control,"" Dr. Bob Sears told CNN’s Don Lemon. ""Not mild reactions. Severe reactions that land somebody in the hospital, the intensive care unit or cause a permanent disability or death."" We decided to fact-check Sears’ claim that between 3,000 and 4,500 people report severe vaccine reactions that ""land somebody in the hospital, the intensive care unit or cause a permanent disability or death."" What the CDC says, and doesn’t say The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does maintain a database of reported cases of adverse reactions to vaccines. It’s called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS for short. The system allows almost anyone -- from a doctor to a nurse to a pharmacist to a patient or parent -- to enter in any information about illnesses or medical issues that follow someone receiving a vaccine. The information is collected so that officials can spot possible trends or side effects related to particular vaccines. Before we show you the numbers for 2014, we’ll give you the same warning the CDC provides any user. It’s a warning Sears failed to present CNN viewers. ""When evaluating data from VAERS, it is important to note that for any reported event, no cause-and-effect relationship has been established. Reports of all possible associations between vaccines and adverse events (possible side effects) are filed in VAERS. Therefore, VAERS collects data on any adverse event following vaccination, be it coincidental or truly caused by a vaccine. The report of an adverse event to VAERS is not documentation that a vaccine caused the event."" We’ll say that again in our own words. There’s no proof that a vaccine caused any of the medical conditions reported in the database. That colors Sears’ statement significantly. ""There’s absolutely no linkage between cause and effect,"" Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center, told us. ""If I received the flu vaccine yesterday and got hit by a bus today, I could enter that into VAERS.  But I doubt anyone would say the vaccine caused the accident. VAERS is a great reporting system to look for trends that would trigger further studies – but it does not pretend to prove that the conditions entered are related to vaccination."" Now back to the numbers. Sears specifically mentioned three outcomes that he described as ""severe vaccine reactions"" --  hospitalization, permanent disability, or death. (There is no category to report someone being sent to an ""intensive care unit,"" nor is there a searchable category for ""severe vaccine reactions."") We looked at 2014 VEARS data, which covers reports processed as of Dec. 14, 2014. VAERS data shows (as of Feb. 3, 2015): 1,244 cases of people reported hospitalized
416 cases of people reporting a disability
122 reported deaths
388 reported life-threatening cases That’s a total of 2,170 events, but once you factor out double and sometimes triple counting -- meaning a reported death could also could include a reported disability or hospitalization -- you drop to a total of 1,737 cases. (The numbers change slightly depending on how you run the search. We searched when cases were reported. Since the database is a living document, the numbers may also shift if you choose to run this calculation yourself.) On the flip side, the 2014 count is only through Dec. 14, meaning that additional cases likely will be reported before the CDC closes out the year. Sears’ defense We presented our findings to Sears, who said he approached his calculation in a more generic way. He said he looked at VAERS in December 2009. ""At that time, the site reported the number of severe reactions each year going back many years. It averaged out at about 30,000 total reactions reported yearly, and the site stated that between 10 percent and 15 percent of these were serious. That's how I get the number 3,000 to 4,500,"" Sears said. ""Now, that fluctuates every year. Some years are lower, some higher,"" Sears said. ""You looked at 2014 data, which looks to be about 1,750. That's a low year."" Here, Sears has a point. In fact, the CDC website does still include a general description that matches what Sears told us. ""Approximately 30,000 VAERS reports are filed annually, with 10-15% classified as serious (resulting in permanent disability, hospitalization, life-threatening illnesses or death),"" the CDC says. But that didn’t amount to 3,500-4,000 cases in 2014, nor any year we searched as far back as 2006. Sears is correct that 2014 appears to be a low year. Year Cases of reported hospitalization,
disability, deaths or life-threatening illness 2014 1,737 2013 1,837 2012 1,934 2011 2,045 2010 2,570 2009 2,701 2008 2,465 2007 2,289 2006 1,477 Other data on vaccine injuries As we’ve written, the major flaw in the VAERS data is that it does not prove a link between the vaccine and an illness. One area where we get closer to finding a causal link is through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The program, created on Oct. 1, 1988, was set up to help compensate victims found to be injured by certain vaccines. The program is funded by a $0.75 excise tax on vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for routine administration to children, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. According to Health and Human Services, 3,887 compensation awards have been paid since the first claims were filed in 1989. Another 9,860 claims were dismissed. A total of 633 petitions were filed seeking payment in fiscal year 2014. Petitions peaked in fiscal year 2003 when 2,592 claims were filed. This data is far from perfect. But what it shows is that in the last 25 years, the fund has paid out claims to 3,887 people -- which translates to an average of 155 paid claims per year. Health and Human Services cautions that settlements do not indicate safety concerns about the vaccine alleged to cause the injury. ""Settlements are not an admission by the United States or the Secretary of Health and Human Services that the vaccine caused the petitioner’s alleged injuries,"" officials write. ""The vaccine compensation program ... provides a bit more linkage between cause and effect, but the rulings are decided in a court of law, and science may or may not play a big role in the finding,"" Troisi told us. ""It’s also very hard to prove cause and effect on an individual case, which is what is happening with these findings."" Our ruling Sears said, ""Every year in the United States between 3,000 and 4,500 severe vaccine reactions are reported to the Centers for Disease Control. Not mild reactions. Severe reactions that land somebody in the hospital, the intensive care unit or cause a permanent disability or death."" Sears reached this conclusion by doing some math based on data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But, at the least, he would have been better off sticking with the CDC’s general claim that 10 percent to 15 percent of reported reactions are deemed serious. The fact is, the CDC’s database includes a clear warning that the there is no evidence the reported cases are related to vaccines. Nor do the specific years we looked at -- going back to 2006 -- back up Sears’ specific range. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, which is our definition of Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/feb/03/bob-sears/what-cdc-statistics-say-about-vaccine-illnesses-in/

Ald. Joe Davis claims streetcar project would take revenue from Milwaukee Public Schools
","A key opponent of Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett’s plan for a $123.9 million downtown streetcar is criticizing the project by saying it would hurt Milwaukee Public Schools. Ald. Joe Davis Sr., who is running for mayor in the 2016 election, had this to say in a YouTube video: The streetcar would ""actually take precious revenue away from one of the taxing industries which I truly care about, and that is the Milwaukee Public School system."" We haven’t heard the phrase ""taxing industry"" before, but we have heard variations of the claim. Would the streetcar project ""take precious revenue away"" from MPS? The money picture Let’s start with where the money is coming from to build the controversial project (the budget for operating it is a separate question). The primary source of funding is a $55 million federal grant. The city hopes for another $10 million from the feds. The remainder would come from various taxing districts, including $9.7 million that has already been authorized by the Common Council. Barrett wants to borrow another $49.3 million that would be repaid through two Tax Incremental Districts, or TIDS. The districts typically work like this: The city pays for infrastructure improvements, such as new or reconfigured roads or site preparation to help assure a development takes place. The money the city borrows is repaid through taxes generated by the increased value of properties within the district. Once the borrowing is paid off, the value of the land is added to the general tax rolls. Under Barrett’s plan, some of the streetcar borrowing ($31 million) would be rolled into a new TID -- No. 82 -- near downtown's lakefront that would also include the proposed Couture high rise project. The rest ($18.3 million) would come from an existing TID -- No. 56 -- on E. Erie St. in the Historic Third Ward. Here’s the catch: The borrowing from that second TID is nearly paid off. So, instead of that money going to the general tax rolls, the life of the district would be extended and the money from the increased property taxes would go to repay the streetcar borrowing. That makes this district central to Davis’ argument. After all, when property is tied up in a district, none of the other taxing units -- such as MPS and Milwaukee County -- can collect money based on the increasing value. Indeed, when we asked Davis for backup, he responded with an email linking to a Jan. 7, 2015 memo from the city’s Legislative Reference Bureau, which does research on issues for the Common Council. The memo says ""total estimated property tax deferrals for all taxing entities"" from the two tax districts that would help fund the streetcar would be $104 million, and says the MPS portion of that sum is $40 million. We’re already heading down the wrong track. In the video, Davis said the project would take revenue away from MPS. The memo talks about property tax deferrals from tax districts. That phrasing sounds like it would be money otherwise collected by MPS. In reality, that $40 million represents the MPS ""share"" of the projected increased overall property value within the districts. It is MPS’ ability to draw on this value to collect taxes that would be ""deferred."" No matter how you characterize it, there isn’t money currently flowing to MPS that will be choked off by the streetcar. Additionally, by law, tax money being collected through a TID can’t be used for other purposes such as police or, for that matter, other taxing entities such as MPS. Indeed, on Feb. 3, 2014, the Legislative Reference Bureau retracted the earlier memo saying it was based on ""inaccurate assertions and incomplete analysis"" and that the analysis had ""misinformed and become a distraction from this important policy debate."" Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said Davis is ""wrong on several counts."" ""As debt is incurred to fund TID improvements, those bonds are repaid with the incremental property tax revenue that comes from the new increased value of the TID,"" Berry said in an email. ""Other units of government would never have received that money anyway, because without (the district) there would be no increased value."" Indeed, Berry said, the opposite of Davis’ claim might be the case -- if a district works as planned. ""In the long run, schools, etc. will get more money than they would otherwise have received"" because those entities will eventually have a larger tax base, he said. We also asked MPS about the impact of tax districts on revenue. The ""districts do not directly impact MPS' revenue authority under the funding rules for K-12 education,"" said MPS spokesman Tony Tagilavia. Davis did not respond to emails or telephone messages seeking an interview on the matter. More to consider There is another wrinkle to Davis’ claim. For the new TID, the one surrounding the Couture development, Berry’s argument clearly holds true. The development is contingent on the TID. And there are no new taxes generated without the increased value from the development. But what about the second, existing TID -- the one about to go back onto the tax rolls? Wouldn’t that money otherwise go to MPS and the other taxing entities? Yes and no. The increased value would be added to the city’s overall property tax base, which MPS and the other entities draw upon. But the amount collected in taxes for schools is driven by the MPS budget and the spending plan from the School Board. That is, once MPS and the other taxing entities set their annual budgets, the portion to be collected from property taxes is simply divided into the city’s overall property base. This sets the annual tax rate, which in turn creates the tax bills.  As such, there may be more capacity for MPS to collect taxes -- but other factors, including state-imposed property tax caps play a role in how much of that new, increased tax base MPS can tap. A separate memo -- in response to the one from the Legislative Reference Bureau -- made this very point. That memo was written Jan. 8, 2015  by city budget director Mark Nicolini and Assessment Commissioner Mary Reavey, both part of Barrett’s administration. ""There are no ‘property tax deferrals’ nor any other automatic revenue growth that occurs when TIDs are closed,"" the memo said. A final footnote: The city currently has 45 active taxing districts, with some performing better than others. Twice in the past the city has redirected revenue from the high-performing TID 56 -- the one slated to be redirected to the streetcar -- to bolster ""neighborhood-based"" TIDs in the central city. In all, about $10.5 million has gone to this purpose. Davis voted in favor of those previous changes to TID 56, as well as in favor of about $225 million in projects using the same kind of tax district funding, council records show. Our rating Davis says the streetcar project would take revenue away from Milwaukee Public Schools. He bases his argument on the use of two tax financing districts that would help pay for the streetcar project. From a technical perspective, he is off base. Taxes generated on additional development in the tax districts would go -- by law -- to the designated use until the borrowing is paid off. And once the districts close, it still wouldn’t be direct revenue for the schools. Rather, it’s additional tax base. From our perspective, that does lend some credibility to Davis claim. If the increased value went onto the overall tax rolls, all property taxpayers in the city would benefit. And, in theory, MPS could collect more without taking a bigger bite out of the pocketbooks of property owners. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/feb/03/joe-davis-sr/ald-joe-davis-claims-streetcar-project-would-hurt-/

Rick Perry says changes in drug laws led to lowest Texas crime rate since 1968
","Changes in law, Rick Perry said, explain why Texas crime is at hippie-era lows. In his last appearance before state lawmakers as governor, the Republican presidential prospect saluted bipartisan efforts to treat alcoholism and drug addiction as diseases. ""Over the years, I came to see our approach to nonviolent drug offenders as flawed,"" Perry said in his Jan. 15, 2015 speech. ""And because of the leadership of Democrats and Republicans, we started to take a new approach."" Lawmakers created local drug courts, Perry said, also creating ""diversion programs that treat alcoholism and drug addiction as a disease and not a moral failing."" ""And because of these changes in policy, we’ve been able to shut down three prisons,"" Perry said. ""Repeat offenses by drug offenders are down and,"" he said to applause, ""the lowest crime rate in this state since 1968."" (His prepared text said ""the crime rate is the lowest it has been since 1968."") Unlock your doors, Texas. But did Perry, governor from late 2000 into early 2015, get all of this right? Asked the basis of Perry’s statement, gubernatorial spokesman Felix Browne emailed us a chart, drawing from FBI-collected data, listing Texas crime rates since 1960. And in 2013, the latest year of available data, Texas had its lowest overall crime index—3,666.5 property and violent crimes per 100,000 residents—since 1968 when the index was 3,478.3, according to the chart. Gauged violent crimes include murder, aggravated assault and rape. Tallied property crimes roll in burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft. Outside looks Criminologists responding to our inquiries agreed Perry’s claim was supported by the total Texas crime index. Also, according to the figures, the state’s 2013 property crime rate, 3,258.20, was the lowest since the 3,208.1 rate for 1968. The state’s violent crime rate, 408.3, (a sliver less than the 408.6 rates of 2011 and 2012) was the lowest since it was 407.7 in 1977. Still, the overall crime index can be overplayed, Carnegie Mellon University expert Alfred Blumstein said by email. We asked him about the meaning of the index after noticing an FBI web page stating the agency hadn’t calculated total crime indexes since about 2004 after advisers concluded the index and a modified index (folding in arson) weren’t ""true indicators of the degrees of criminality because they were always driven upward by the offense with the highest number, typically larceny-theft. The sheer volume of those offenses overshadowed more serious but less frequently committed offenses, creating a bias against a jurisdiction with a high number of larceny-thefts but a low number of other serious crimes such as murder and forcible rape."" Blumstein told us he prefers to focus on individual tabulated crimes, particularly murders and robberies if he’s analyzing violent crimes--""which I think people are much more concerned with."" Then again, Tony Fabelo, the Austin-based research director for the Justice Center, which focuses on public safety issues for the national Council on State Governments, said he had no qualms about anyone stressing the index. Methodological doubts abide in academia, he said by phone. ""However, when a politician talks about the crime rate, they are"" understandably ""using the crime index,"" Fabelo said. National decrease a long-term trend Fabelo suggested other reasons for perspective--starting with the fact that crime in Texas (and the nation) has been on the decline most of the past quarter century, according to the FBI statistics. In 19 of the 24 years from 1990 through 2013, the state’s crime index went down; it last increased in 2009, according to the governor’s chart. In the same years, the violent crime rate decreased in all but three years, most recently in 2002, the chart indicates. Nationally, the FBI says, the 2013 violent crime rate was down 21 percent compared to the rate in 2004 while the property crime rate was 22 percent lower. Texas had a slightly bigger difference; its 2013 violent crime rate was 25 percent less than its 2004 rate; the state’s 2013 property crime rate was 28 percent lower. Generally, Texas Christian University criminologist Michael Bachmann said there are ""different schools of thought why crimes are decreasing nationally and the answer you'll get will vary dependent on which theoretical paradigm the criminologist subscribes to. The range goes from simple demographic changes (aging of the population),"" he emailed, ""and effects of abortion legislation to better policing, security and surveillance technology (esp. cell phones), proactive policing, or mandatory minimum sentencing laws for chronic offenders."" And crimes not tallied by the FBI’s reporting system may merit more attention, Bachmann suggested. Financial fraud, white-collar crimes and crimes solely committed online, he said, are on the rise. Perry’s explanation for Texas rate The governor’s ‘68 reference aside, did the crime rate reduction occur due to the actions he described? Changes were put into law with his support. According to a January 2002 state report by Fabelo, drug diversion courts started in some Texas counties in the 1990s. After Perry became governor in late 2000, he agreed to legislation passed in 2001 requiring nine populous counties, including six counties that already had courts up and running, to establish the courts, the report said. And with Perry’s approval, the 2007 Legislature expanded the mandate to more counties, provided that federal or state funding was available, and authorized similar courts to consider driving-while-intoxicated cases. By email, David Reaboi of Right on Crime, a project of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, noted the closing of a state prison in Sugar Land in 2011 (due to legislated budget cuts, an August 2011 Texas Tribune news story said) and the shutdown in 2013 of two privately-run correctional facilities, which the Tribune attributed to a tighter budget and fewer inmates. Reaboi also noted a September 2012 report by the Council of State Governments finding that over the past few years, Texas sent fewer ex-convicts back to prison. From 2000 to 2007, the state’s recidivism rate—reflecting felons who returned to prison within three years after they were discharged or paroled—dropped 22 percent, according to the report, which hailed the decrease as proof that additional rehabilitation and treatment programs were working. Then again, a  news story on the report in the Austin American-Statesman said some criminologists also noted the average age of offenders was rising; older people tend to commit fewer crimes. Derek Cohen of Right on Crime guided us to a 2013 state report showing that from 2008 to 2013, the number of adults incarcerated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice dipped, rebounded and then dipped more than before, ultimately hovering around 152,000:  
Reaboi commented: ""Perry is on firm ground."" Fabelo called drug courts among factors contributing to the index’s decline though, he reminded,  those courts only handle a subset of suspected wrongdoers. ""You can never tease out the impact of any specific policies,"" Fabelo said. Blumsteim, speaking generally on Perry’s point, said: ""What he’s taking credit for is very much a national phenomenon and a national trend."" He said it might be more meaningful to compare Texas to other states year by year. Our ruling Perry said Texas has its lowest crime rate since 1968 because of changes in law regarding nonviolent drug offenders. In 2013, an index combining Texas rates for property and violent crimes reached its lowest level since 1968. Legislated changes affecting drug offenders surely contributed. But in Texas and nationally, crime has been decreasing for a while, for multiple reasons. We rate this statement, an oversimplification, Half True.

Barack Obama says politicians get credit for founding colleges
","President Barack Obama recently went around the mainstream media and offered sit-down interviews to a trio of YouTube celebrities -- Bethany Mota, GloZell Green and Hank Green. The interviews were live-streamed on Jan. 22, 2015. In the interview, Mota -- a California teen who makes ""videos about hair, makeup, fashion, DIY projects, and basically anything that I love"" -- asked Obama, ""Why should the younger generation be interested in politics, and why should it matter to them?"" Here’s how Obama answered: ""Well, basically, politics is just -- how do we organize ourselves as a society? How do we make decisions about how we're going to live together? So, young people care about how college is paid for. Well, the truth of the matter is, the reason we even have colleges is that at some point there were politicians who said, ‘You know what? We should start colleges.’  Dating back to Abraham Lincoln, who started something called the land-grant colleges. He understood that government should invest in people being able to get an education and the tools to succeed. You guys are going to be the ones who are using these colleges and universities, and if they are not getting enough funding from government, and your tuition goes up, and you've got more debt, you're the ones affected. So you'd better have a voice and know what's going on about who's making decisions about that."" A reader asked us to check out the claim that ""the reason we even have colleges is that at some point there were politicians who said, ‘You know what? We should start colleges.’ "" Initially, we wondered whether checking this claim would amount to an unfair ""gotcha"" game, but we were persuaded to rate it after hearing from higher-education historians who found Obama’s claim problematic. The White House told PolitiFact that Obama was basing his claim on the federal government’s longstanding role in creating land-grant colleges, which began with enactment of the Morrill Act on July 2, 1862. The purpose of the law ""was to teach agriculture, military tactics, and the mechanic arts as well as classical studies, so members of the working classes could obtain a liberal, practical education,"" according to the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities. The term ""land grant"" stems from the granting of federal lands to states for the creation of universities. By citing the Morrill Act, the White House has a point. Since 1862, the act has been used to establish more than 100 land-grant colleges in all 50 states, plus additional institutions in U.S. territories. They include such major institutions of higher education as Cornell, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Ohio State, Penn State, Texas A&M and the University of Wisconsin. ""The fact is, politicians get enormous credit for creating our public universities, and most notably the land-grant colleges,"" said Barry Toiv, the vice president for public affairs at the Association of American Universities. ""It's one of the country's great, democratic, truly American accomplishments."" Still, despite the clear achievements of the Morrill Act, Obama outstrips the evidence when he says that ""politicians"" are ""the reason we even have colleges."" To start, we looked at the data for public colleges vs. private colleges, as well as the enrollment for each. For institutions, data from the federal Education Department shows that, among four-year institutions, fully 77 percent of them are private. The rate is lower for two-year institutions -- 45 percent are private -- but if you include both categories, it works out to 66 percent private. Since private universities were not typically established by ""politicians,"" this data shows that just one-third of institutions of higher education have a good claim to having been created by ""politicians."" As it happens, private colleges tend to be smaller than public colleges, so the data for enrollment skews more strongly toward public institutions. But even if you measure by enrollment, private institutions comprise a significant minority, undercutting Obama's sweeping claim. For four-year institutions, 40 percent of enrollment is at private institutions, and for two-year institutions, 6 percent of enrollment is at private institutions. Overall, 28 percent of enrollment is at private universities. It’s also worth noting that many colleges and universities were established in the United States -- and even in colonial America -- before the Morrill Act was passed. More than 70 colleges and universities were founded in what is now the United States prior to 1862, including seven of the eight Ivy League schools (the only exception being Cornell, a land-grant school). More than a dozen universities considered public were established prior to 1862, including the University of North Carolina, the University of Michigan and the University of Virginia. Historians of American higher education told PolitiFact that, in their view, Obama’s description is glib enough to demand a correction. John R. Thelin, a professor at the University of Kentucky and author of A History of American Higher Education, said it’s not even entirely accurate to claim credit for politicians in the founding of ""state"" schools. ""I doubt many of the ‘public (or, ‘state’) colleges and universities were founded by politicians,"" Thelin said. ""Usually some individual or group petitioned and prodded to obtain a charter for the state university. Often, some politicians opposed and obstructed such initiative."" More than a century ago in South Carolina, Thelin said, populist lawmaker ""Pitchfork Ben"" Tillman wanted to close down the elite University of South Carolina, while in the 1920s and 1930s, the University of Georgia continually had to defend itself against a governor who wanted to punish and close down the state university. Meanwhile, in New Hampshire in the early 19th century, a hostile state Legislature wanted to take away Dartmouth College’s charter, he said. Roger L. Geiger, an education professor at Penn State and author of The History of American Higher Education: Learning and Culture from the Founding to World War II, went so far as to say that Obama’s comment is ""an egregious misstatement"" that ""reflects supreme ignorance of higher education."" ""Most American colleges and universities were founded when groups of private individuals decided, ‘We should start a college,"" Geiger said. Geiger said that many urban universities, such as those in Akron and Youngstown, were privately founded; only later were these schools taken over by their states. Temple and Pitt also fall into this category, he said. The pattern of privately founded colleges later being taken over by state governments is clear in the history of ""normal schools,"" the institutions that are now called teachers’ colleges. While some states, such as Illinois, Michigan and New York did establish public normal schools, many other such schools were established privately, including institutions in Pennsylvania and Indiana. After World War II, many of these private normal schools became regional state universities, Geiger said. ""Typically the expansion of state systems occurred through the takeover of existing, privately founded institutions,"" he said. Our ruling Obama said ""the reason we even have colleges is that at some point there were politicians who said, ‘You know what? We should start colleges.’ "" Even allowing for some oversimplification in a live interview, Obama is exaggerating. Public colleges and universities are a distinct minority of all such institutions, and while they comprise a majority of enrollment nationally, private schools account for a significant minority of enrollment. Meanwhile, historians of American higher education note that even in the case of ""public"" universities, ""politicians"" can’t automatically claim credit. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rated it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/feb/03/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-politicians-get-credit-founding-/

Claims about job creation under Deal accurate
","Jobs and the economy have been the top issue on Georgians’ minds for four years running, but this year, confidence in the state’s economic situation has stalled. That’s according to a recent exclusive Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll, one conducted every year before the Legislature convenes. But once session began, Gov. Nathan Deal gave a far more optimistic view of Georgia jobs in his State of the State address. ""Since I took office, over 319,000 new private sector jobs have been created in Georgia with nearly 93,000 of those coming in the past 12 months,"" Deal said. By most measures, the job market in Georgia and nationwide has been looking up. PolitiFact Georgia wondered, though, if the state has added 300,000 jobs – the equivalent of combining the populations of Alpharetta, Dunwoody, Roswell and Sandy Springs– since Deal took office in January 2011. A Deal spokeswoman referred us to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Deal, she said, was referencing the seasonally adjusted, private-sector figures, comparing January 2011 and the preliminary figures for November 2014. We checked, and the numbers were spot on. If anything, although the numbers sounded large, Deal actually underestimated the tally. That’s because agency updates the preliminary numbers on a monthly lag. When it releases the December figures it also revised November’s totals. November’s figure went up, as did the preliminary numbers for December, which would measure the number of private-sector jobs added in Deal’s entire first term. ""The total for that same period now is 325,600 new private-sector jobs with 99,100 of those coming in that 12-month span,"" Deal spokeswoman Merry Hunter Hipp said. PolitiFact Georgia decided to look at the data another way, examining the tally of non-seasonally adjusted jobs in the private sector. Doing so smooths out some of the highs and lows in hiring that come, say, from seasonal holiday work. On that front, Deal was even more conservative. The BLS data shows Georgia added 395,900 of those jobs between January 2011 and December 2014. For the December-to-December period, the state added 106,600 non-seasonally adjusted jobs. ""With the new data, it is a slight understatement to say 319,000 jobs,"" said Wesley Tharpe, a policy analyst on tax and economic data at the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. ""We would agree his math is on target."" Of course, though, there is a footnote. Deal took office more-or-less in the middle of the Great Recession, which for economic purposes started in December 2007. At the time, Georgia had 3,471,300 private-sector jobs. The preliminary number for last December is 3,501,200 such jobs. The .9 percent difference suggests that only now has Georgia filled the hole of jobs lost during the downturn, Tharpe said. That means it took the state seven years to fill the hole created from the Great Recession. Going forward is the first time the state will see net new jobs – at a time when there are also new people entering the workforce. That’s why the state’s unemployment rate – though finally declining – remains more than a percent above the national average, Tharpe said. And, many of the jobs lost in construction and manufacturing are being replaced with lower-paying positions in retail and service industries, according to the state Labor Department. Combined, those factors may account for the public’s worry about a stagnating economy, even when the data shows an increase in jobs. Deal said more than 319,000 private sector jobs were created during his first term. Even if that increase only replaces jobs lost before he took office, the data show his estimates were accurate and even conservative.

Nationwide Super Bowl ad claims accidents are the leading cause of death among children
","Super Bowl XLIX had everything a fan could hope for (unless you’re from Seattle). A hectic, nail-biting finish. Amazing plays. Dancing sharks. But despite the genuine on-field fireworks, it was once again a commercial — not the game itself — that had many people talking. And not necessarily for good reasons. A 45-second commercial by insurance company Nationwide was widely panned by professionals and amatuer Twitter critics for its haphazard attempt to tug at the heart strings by imagining the long-term consequences of a child’s accidental death. In it, a boy, lamenting that he won’t ever be able to ride a bike — or fly or get married — explains, ""I couldn’t grow up, because I died from an accident."" Punctuated by an overflowing bathtub in the background, the following text on the screen appears: ""The number one cause of childhood deaths is preventable accidents."" The masses, and the experts, have already spoken on the wisdom of running the ad. But as fact-checkers, we were interested in whether a statistic viewed by perhaps 110 million people was accurate. We reached out to Nationwide but didn’t hear back. The company did, however, release a statement on their website after the public’s reaction began to mount. ""Preventable injuries around the home are the leading cause of childhood deaths in America. Most people don’t know that,"" Nationwide wrote. ""The sole purpose of this message was to start a conversation, not sell insurance. We want to build awareness of an issue that is near and dear to all of us—the safety and well being of our children. We knew the ad would spur a variety of reactions."" The statement continued, ""While some did not care for the ad, we hope it served to begin a dialogue to make safe happen for children everywhere."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks death by cause. One category is ""unintentional injuries,"" which encompasses everything from car accidents and falls to drownings and the accidental discharge of a firearm. ""Unintentional injuries"" are indeed quite common across most age groups. According to the data, unintentional injury was the leading cause of death in 2013 for Americans among children and adults up to age 44, with one exception: infants. For infants — children below 1 year of age — congenital anomalies, or birth defects, resulted in 4,758 deaths in 2013, CDC reported, making them the top killer. Unintentional injuries were fifth with 1,156. Birth defects continue to claim lives after children pass their first birthday. Through age 14, there were 5,574 cumulative deaths from such complications in 2013. Compare that to unintentional injuries that resulted in deaths. There were 3,993 cumulative deaths in 2013 among children through age 14. Bottom line: From birth to 14, the most common cause of death is birth defects. From one year old to 14, the most common cause is accidents. So the question becomes: How do you define ""children"" -- when childhood starts, and where it ends? Once a child reaches the mid-to-late teens, the rate of deaths caused by birth defects drops significantly, to about 30 a year for each of the following ages: 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19. But conversely, the number of accidental deaths rises in years 15 through 19. Why? It’s partly because around that time, kids start getting behind the wheel, and the number of transportation accidents increases dramatically. While there are about 500 deaths from transportation-related injuries from ages 10 to 14 combined, it’s double that from age 15 to 17. Here are the cumulative deaths by accident for each age and how they compare to total deaths by birth defect in 2013. Cause <15 <16 <17 <18 <19 Birth defect 5,609 5,643 5,674 5,707 5,740 Accident 4,293 4,754 5,444 6,455 7,645 Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Not until you include 18-year-olds in the data does death by accident surpass birth defects. There’s a good argument that this is all semantics. ""Infants"" can be considered distinct from ""children,"" which would suggest that congenital anomalies of babies should not be factored in. By the same token, some might question whether 18- and 19-year-olds are still children. As for the CDC itself, it tends to separate children under the age of 1 from other age groups in most of their data sets, and an agency spokesman didn’t contest the notion that accidents are the leading cause of death among children. And if so, that’s been the case for a while. In 1999, the earliest year of data that’s publicly available, unintentional injury caused the most deaths from age 1 to 34. This raises another bit of missing context: The number of deaths caused by accidents among children in 2013 is essentially half of what it was 15 years ago. So while it’s still the No. 1 killer, it has dropped rather significantly. A postscript: While we’re checking the actual ad in this item, Nationwide erred when it phrased its after-the-fact defense. The company’s statement claimed that ""preventable injuries around the home are the leading cause of childhood deaths."" Actually, transportation injuries are the top cause of accidental deaths among kids. From age 1 to 14, nearly half of all accidental deaths are related to motor vehicles or other types of land transportation. And that rate only increases once you start including older children in their mid-to-late teens. Our ruling In a Super Bowl ad, Nationwide claimed, ""The No. 1 cause of childhood deaths is preventable accidents."" The claim is based on hard numbers from the CDC, and the general trend has been consistent for the last decade and a half. However, there are different ways to slice the numbers, and if infants are counted as children, then congenital anomalies top the list for certain age ranges. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/02/nationwide/nationwide-super-bowl-ad-claims-accidents-are-lead/

Senate voted on more amendments in January than it did in all of 2014
","There’s a new sheriff in charge of the U.S. Senate, and he’s eager to show how he’s shaking up the law of the land. We’re talking, of course, about new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who took over the Senate’s top slot after the midterm elections bounced Democrats from power. And in this new world, Republicans are touting an eye-catching factoid as evidence of a functional Senate, one they say runs on fairness and order under GOP control. ""Amazing fact: Senate has already voted on more amendments in 2015 than Reid allowed ALL YEAR last year,"" tweeted Phil Kerpen, opinion-writer and president of conservative 501(c)(4) American Commitment, on Jan. 22, 2015. Kerpen, formerly of Americans for Prosperity, the Club for Growth and the libertarian Cato Institute, told us he heard the statistic from McConnell himself. We wanted to know if it was true that the Senate has already allowed more votes on amendments in less than one month than all of 2014. And why? On Senate stoppage and filled ‘trees’ The simple answer on the number of votes is that Kerpen is correct. But the reason behind it varies depending on your particular political lens. A simple search of Senate roll call votes on amendments in 2014 and 2015 backs up Kerpen’s statement. In 2014, there were 15 roll call votes on amendments. As of Jan. 22, 2015, the date of Kerpen's tweet, there were 16 roll call votes on amendments. There have since been 17 more votes on amendments to the bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which passed a week later but will likely face President Barack Obama’s veto pen. Kerpen came at the tally a different way, counting ""real"" votes on amendments, a distinction that also includes roll call votes on motions to table amendments, which effectively kills them. By his math, there were 16 votes allowed on amendments in 2014 and 26 so far in 2015. By either count, the numbers work. What changed?  In 2014, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., relied on a funny-sounding procedure called ""filling the amendment tree."" Basically, Reid filled the docket allowed for amendments by adding amendments with inconsequential changes that no one else could override. The procedural tactic prevented Republican-sponsored amendments from being heard on the floor. ""He did that more than any of his predecessors,"" Donald Ritchie, Senate historian, told PunditFact. Reid wasn’t doing this just to be a not-so-nice guy. To Democrats, it was to counter Republican tactics. Unlike the House, the Senate does not have strict rules for the substance of amendments that can be attached to bills (i.e., you could add a health care amendment onto a defense spending bill). And that’s exactly what happened in years past. Republicans began introducing off-topic amendments that, for example, cut off U.S. aid to Egypt or, a favorite of Sen. David Vitter, R-La., to eliminate health care subsidies for Senate staffers. No matter what the topic of the bill. Sometimes this was in effort to force difficult votes for Democrats back home. To Republicans, Reid’s style of blocking amendments emulated an uncooperative and off-the-rails leadership style -- one that is tremendously well-documented -- that stymied policymaking. To Democrats, it was necessary to get anything accomplished. Republicans were filibustering votes on the underlying bills and not committing to a vote in exchange for allowing some amendments, said Steven S. Smith, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis. ""Reid saw they were filibustering everything, bringing the place to a standstill,"" Smith told us. ""So he wondered why he should give them votes at all."" Reid’s office does not dispute the number of votes on amendments, but they do take issue with what they deem an ""empty talking point"" that neglects Republican responsibility for the gridlock. His spokesman argues that Republicans blocked their own share of amendments by not compromising on potential amendments to be heard on the floor and refusing to come to an agreement about when a bill should come to a vote. ""(Reid) makes no apologies for blocking what we all consider to be extremely pointless political amendments that were just designed not to improve the bills we were working on but to run 30-second political ads against Democratic senators,"" said spokesman Adam Jentleson. ""Republicans are entirely culpable in that number being what it is."" Reid’s style of blocking amendments irritated Republicans, sure, but it also flared up during the 2014 midterms with Republicans using it to attack Democrats. The GOP pounced on Alaska Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Begich, for instance, for his lack of roll-call votes on his amendments. McConnell, conversely, said he would allow open amendments on the Keystone XL bill, hence the GOP celebrating its ""new management"" style. As political experts told us to expect, there have already been clashes with McConnell’s methods a few days after the initial celebration. During the Keystone debate, Democrats objected to McConnell tabling Democratic amendments and not letting Democrats debate their amendments for a minute. Reid, perhaps ironically, tweeted, ""I've never seen debate shut down as aggressively as when Sen. McConnell refused to allow Dems to debate their own amendments for just 1 min. ... and that’s saying something."" What the experts tell us Bottom line, experts said, voters shouldn’t take the new tactics as evidence that McConnell’s ""return to normal order"" will give the Democrats an easy path to voting on the amendments of their choice. ""It’s not going to happen,"" said Roy Meyers, University of Maryland, Baltimore County affiliate professor of public policy. University of Kansas political science professor Burdett Loomis agreed, saying, ""The overall idea isn’t trivial (‘regular order’), but the exact number isn’t very significant, especially if McConnell, as expected, runs the Senate almost completely to the (Republicans’) advantage."" It’s too early to know whether we have a ""sea change"" of order on our hands in the Senate, said Sarah Binder, George Washington University political science professor. ""In other words, the intense partisanship of the Senate that led Sen. Reid to all-but shut down the amendment process last year has not dissipated,"" Binder said. ""I think the question going forward is whether McConnell can find a way to conduct the Senate such that senators from both parties believe their legislative needs are being met."" Our ruling Kerpen, among others, tweeted, ""Amazing fact: Senate has already voted on more amendments in 2015 than (Harry) Reid allowed ALL YEAR last year."" On the numbers, that is right. But experts cautioned us that the claim falls more in the interesting factoid category than a sign of a different or more cooperative Senate leadership. The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information. That meets our definition of Mostly True. Correction: An earlier version of this fact-check incorrectly described Sen. David Vitter's amendment.",/factchecks/2015/feb/02/phil-kerpen/claim-mitch-mcconnell-has-already-allowed-more-ame/

Joe Scarborough, CNN fight over morning ratings game

Avg. daily viewers per year 2+ (1000s) Avg. daily viewers per year 25-54 (1000s) Year MSNBC CNN* HLN MSNBC CNN* HLN 2014 347 317 223 100 104 104 2013 407 294 238 135 109 122 2012 458 235 248 166 95 128 2011 449 292 315 148 125 154 2010 387 308 316 118 120 185 * CNN’s New Day didn’t launch until midway through 2013; earlier years in the table relate to previous CNN programs in the same time slot, 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.) Crunch the Nielsen numbers this way, and Scarborough is correct. Based on all viewers in the course of a year, including those as young as 2, his program comes out on top for the past five years. It’s a mixed bag in the 25-54 demographic. This sort of ratings battle is old hat to James Webster, a professor at Northwestern University’s School of Communications. Webster told PunditFact that this sort of squabble over who is in the lead happens pretty regularly. ""They are both looking at numbers that work to their advantage,"" Webster said. Another communications researcher, Bob Thompson at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, saw a certain vagueness in Scarborough’s tweet. The reference to CNN is broad, Thompson said, and he was confident Scarborough was looking beyond a narrow demographic. ""The ‘more people’ gives no demographic qualification, so his claim here is for total viewers,"" Thompson said. Webster cautioned that small differences of a few thousand viewers might not be statistically significant. ""Technically, you can claim victory but these surveys only measure a tiny sample of the viewing audience and that means they are subject to large sampling errors,"" Webster said. For example, for the 25-54 age group in September 2014, CNN was ahead by 2,000 viewers, but statistically, that was a tie with MSNBC. Webster said consistent trends provide the most reliable perspective. We took the yearly averages, the framework most favorable to MSNBC, and looked at the difference each year in total audience. Over the past three years, CNN and HLN have greatly narrowed the gap with MSNBC. There’s a similar trend in the 25 to 54 age group, and by the most conservative interpretation of the numbers, the three programs tied in 2014. Our ruling Scarborough tweeted that more people have watched Morning Joe than CNN and HLN 5 years in a row. In the most general sense, the average daily audience each year for anyone 2 years old and up, he is correct. But there are many other ways to slice the apple that paint a more complicated ratings picture. Looking at the more valuable television demographic for advertisers, 25-to-54-year-olds, MSNBC has been in a dogfight with CNN and HLN. And more recent month-by-month data shows CNN clearly is gaining ground and has surpassed Morning Joe. Scarborough’s claim is literally accurate, but experts we consulted said it’s a bit deceiving given the other data that exists. That most closely fits our definition of Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/02/joe-scarborough/scarborough-morning-joe-topped-cnn-and-hln-5-years/

Comstock says family health policies have increased by $4,154 under Obama
","""Did you know under President Obama family health care premiums have increased $4,154 on the average?"" U.S. Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-10th, recently tweeted. We didn’t know that. So we gave it a look. Other claims using the same number have popped up on a number GOP websites across the country. Comstock and others say the $4,154 figure comes from an annual report on employer health benefits that was published by the Kaiser Family Foundation on Sept. 10, 2014. Kaiser’s findings were based on a survey of more than 2,000 businesses of all sizes across the nation about their health insurance costs. On Page 31 is a chart that details the average annual premiums for single and family coverage for work-based health care plans since 1999.    The chart shows that in 2008, the average cost for family coverage -- shared by the company and the employee -- was $12,680. In 2014, it was $16,834. According to Comstock, that means there’s been a $4,154 increase under Obama. But there’s a problem with that computation. Obama didn’t take office until Jan. 20, 2009. Kaiser’s 2008 survey was based on responses companies gave from January to May 2008 about their health plans, some of which were contracted before the survey began. In other words, Comstock is holding Obama responsible for some premium increases that occurred during the presidency of George W.  Bush. If we use the 2009 Kaiser report to start to start counting premium increases under Obama -- and even here, some of the hikes still would have occurred when Bush was president -- the bottom line drops. The average family premium was $13,375 in 2009 .The increase between then and 2014 would be $3,459. While Kaiser charts annual average premiums, it makes no attempt to attach the numbers to individual presidents. Craig Palosky, a spokesman for the non-partisan research foundation, declined to comment on Comstock’s claim or offer guidance on the political relevance of data in the report. ""I’d like the survey to speak for itself,"" he said. Some perspective  The $4,154 increase since 2008 that Comstock hangs on Obama is a big number. So is the $3,459 average increase in family premiums since 2009, when Obama took office. But these figures need context. Kaiser, in a news release last September summarizing its 2014 report, said the trend on employer-based family premiums over the last five years is good news. ""Premiums increased more slowly over the past five years than the preceding five years (25 percent to 34 percent) and well below the annual double-digit increases recorded in the late 1990s and early 2000s,"" Kaiser wrote. Comstock, in blaming Obama for rising insurance costs, omits a key qualification: Family premiums offered by employers increased at a faster inflation-adjusted pace during the Bush years than they have under Obama. If we use 2009 as the baseline for Obama, then, as we’ve said, family average premiums rose from $13,375 to $16,834 in 2014. That’s an increase of $3,459. Adjusted for inflation, the price went up 10.3 percent. Looking back over the last six full years of the Bush administration, average family premiums rose from $9,068 in 2003 to $12,680 in 2008. That was an increase of $3,612. Adjusted for inflation, the price went up 19.5 percent. The Kaiser survey, while offering a universe of statistics on employer-based insurance, contains little explanation of trends. Kaiser doesn’t offer an opinion whether the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, is playing a major role in the slowing of family premiums. The report notes that a major feature of the ACA -- a mandate requiring companies with 50 or more full time employees to offer health insurance or pay a federal fine -- is starting to kick in this year. We spoke to two health care experts and they both largely attributed the slowed rise in premiums to the nation’s slow recovery from the Great Recession. ""To some degree, inflation has abated and so has medical inflation,"" said Paul Fronstin, a senior analyst with the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington. Another reason for the slowed premium growth, they said, is that employees are paying a greater share of their health care costs through out-of-pocket deductibles for doctor appointments and hospital stays. Our ruling ""Did you know under President Obama family health care premiums have increased $4,154 on the average?"" Comstock tweeted. She attributed her figure to the Kaiser Foundation’s 2014 survey on employer-based health insurance policies. First, the number is dubious. Kaiser doesn’t t assign statistics in its report to any president. To get to $4,154, Comstock uses Kaiser’s 2008 survey as the base year for Obama. That means she’s blaming Obama for some premiums that went into effect a year or more before he was inaugurated. If we use 2009 as the base year -- when Obama took office -- the increase is $3,459 and even this average would include some policies that were contracted before his presidency began. Second, Comstock’s charge lacks context. By just throwing out a number, the congresswoman suggests the premiums are spiraling. In fact, Kaiser says the rate of increase in the cost of employer-based family policies has slowed during the last five years. We rate Comstock’s statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/feb/02/barbara-comstock/comstock-says-family-health-policies-have-increase/

DOT sign counts roadway deaths
","New Year’s resolutions were still rolling around in our heads, if not being followed. Traffic was moving at a reasonable Saturday clip, which, in metro Atlanta, means it was moving. And suddenly, an overhead sign on I-85 southbound near Spaghetti Junction announced a harsh reality. ""GEORGIA ROADWAY FATALITIES THIS YEAR: 59,"" the sign stated in large lighted letters. ""PLEASE DRIVE SAFELY."" Twenty-four days into January, could that be right? This PolitiFact Georgia scribe was curious. We contacted Natalie Dale, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Transportation, who told us the message board’s numbers were already outdated. Roadway deaths, statewide, for the new year were updated to 70 by Wednesday, Jan. 28th. Among those killed were seven people in Chatham County, five in Fulton County and four in Hall and Hart counties, according to DOT data. Eleven were pedestrians, including Gayla Joyce Walker, 53. The Dunwoody woman was struck repeatedly on I-285 in Sandy Springs, prompting an investigation that shut down a portion of the interstate and snarled traffic for more than three hours during morning rush hour on Jan.22. Two other pedestrians, both over 65, were killed in Fulton County, one on 10th Street and one on Ralph David Abernathy Boulevard, DOT data shows. If previous trends continue, Fulton, DeKalb, Gwinnett and Cobb, Georgia’s most populous counties, will likely end the year with the highest percentages of roadway deaths. But the number of roadway fatalities statewide would actually be down. DOT data shows that roadway deaths in the state have declined slightly year over year -- going from 1,503 in 2008 to 1,147 last year, despite there being nearly a half-million more vehicles on the road. (The state had 8.5 million registered vehicles in 2008 and just less than 9 million vehicles in 2014, according to data we obtained from the Georgia Department of Revenue). State officials offer several potential explanations for the decline in roadway deaths. Dale said safety enhancements, including raised medians, have been DOT priorities. Raised medians have a track record of reducing all accidents by 55 percent and pedestrian accidents in urban areas by 90 percent, she said. Harris Blackwood, director of the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety, said greater seatbelt use is likely a factor. ""We’re seeing some of the highest seat belt use -- somewhere north of 95 percent,"" Blackwood said. That -- combined with safer cars, stepped-up enforcement of drunken driving laws and graduated drivers’ licenses for young drivers --  could be contributing to fewer roadway deaths, he said. Our Ruling. Interstate message boards are being used to alert the motoring public to the latest data on roadway deaths. That can be quickly changing data. Last year, about three people died each day on Georgia roads. That’s a statistic worth pointing out.

ABC expert: 19 states now allow personal exemption for measles vaccine
","The measles outbreak linked to Disneyland provided an uneasy backdrop Sunday for talk about another southwestern venue hosting thousands of people from around the country with varying immunization histories: Super Bowl XLIX in Glendale, Ariz. On the news shows, medical experts stressed that the right of parents to choose whether their children vaccinate should not trump the risk that unvaccinated people pose to public health. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Tom Frieden said on ABC’s This Week that ""study after study"" has shown there are no long-term hazards with vaccines even though pockets of the population are unwilling to get them. ABC News’ chief health and medical editor Dr. Richard Besser lamented how there was once a time where the only children who wouldn’t get vaccinated had immunity issues. ""It used to be that the only children at school who weren't vaccinated were those who had true medical contraindications. They may have an immune problem and couldn't get vaccinated,"" Besser said. ""Now there are 19 states that allow personal belief exemptions. And I think that that is wrong."" There are two parts to Besser’s statement worth considering. One is that 19 states permit parents to exempt their children from vaccinations because of their personal beliefs. The other is that there was a time when the only children who weren’t vaccinated had true medical conditions. The 19 states Documenting the state-by-state situation is a simple task, so we’ll handle that first. Information compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures, among other sources, backs up Besser’s point. While there are laws in every state that spell out vaccination requirements for children entering public school, it is easier to avoid them in some states over others. Every state except for Mississippi and West Virginia provides an exemption for religious reasons. Mississippi’s tough vaccination laws result in high immunization rates in its school children. And as Besser said, 19 states also have exemptions for philosophical, personal reasons. They are Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. Missouri also has an exemption that applies only to daycare, preschool and nursery school. Experts attribute the growth of personal belief exemption laws to pressure from anti-vaccine organizations on policymakers. They use as one benchmark the year 1998, when a study since condemned by peers and retracted by The Lancet, connected the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine with ""leaky gut"" and maybe autism. Another popular year is 1982, when NBC ran the story ""Vaccine Roulette,"" which raised concern about the pertussis vaccine. Historian Elena Conis, author of Vaccine Nation, traces the origins of the movement back to the 1960s and '70s, at a time when people were arguing for tighter environmental regulations, additional women's rights and broader consumer protections. In California, a state well-known for its vaccine resistance, more than 17,200 children enrolled in kindergarten with exemptions from vaccinations based on either religious or personal reasons in the 2013-14 school year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (There is no difference in the CDC reporting for personal or religious reasons.) That was the most of any state by far. California lawmakers tried to tighten up the exemption for personal reasons in 2014 so that instead of just signing a piece of paper, they had to first show they met with a physician who described the risks of going without vaccinations. A Los Angeles Times analysis found an overall decline in the state’s rate of vaccine waivers, dropping from 3.1 percent in 2013 to 2.5 percent in 2014 -- the first drop in a dozen years. Data-crunching by the Washington Post found that the rate of parents applying for personal belief exemptions was strikingly high in Disneyland’s Orange County, the southern coast up to San Luis Obispo, and parts of the northern edge of the state. Vaccine opposition was lower in less-affluent parts of the state, Los Angeles, San Francisco and the Silicon Valley. ""It used to be that the kids that were not vaccinated were from poor families,"" said Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center. ""Now we’re seeing the opposite. These are educated parents who are choosing not to vaccinate their kids."" Looking back on vaccine exemptions So Besser’s correct on the number of states now offering personal exemptions. But his claim that that there was a time when the only children who weren’t vaccinated had true medical conditions doesn’t ring as true. The debate about the effectiveness and dangers of vaccination has been raging for at least 50 years. As part of that debate, there have always been exemptions beyond those for medical reasons. A 1969 report entitled ""State laws on compulsory immunization in the United States,"" which is available through the U.S. National Library of Medicine, does an excellent job of laying out the issue. In 1969, author Charles L. Jackson reported that only 17 states required measles shots, for instance. And that in most every state, religious exemptions were written into the vaccination laws. Five states, Jackson said, went even further. Missouri, Rhode Island, Michigan, Ohio and Illinois had what Jackson called ""voluntary compulsory vaccination."" ""Each state has provisions in the statute for exempting children if a parent objects in writing to such requirements for any reason,"" Jackson wrote. So 45 years ago, less than half the states required a measles vaccine, and only 26 states required any type of vaccine, according to Jackson. That changed, of course, over time, and more states began requiring measles vaccines. But they also included exemptions for religious reasons. What’s the net effect? Vaccinations increased dramatically in the 1970s as new laws came on the books. Joseph A. Califano, the United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare from 1977-79,  helped lead a push that saw vaccination rates rise from 60 percent to over 90 percent. By the early 1980s, more than 95 percent of children were completely immunized by the time they entered school. That number has dipped slightly in recent years. According to the CDC, 92 percent of children 19-35 months old received the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in 2013, the most recent year available and the highest percentage since 2008. Federal health officials were content with the national immunization levels but voiced concerns about late first doses, a rise in measles cases not seen since 2000, and slacking coverage in some states. We were not able to connect with Besser to explain his claim by our deadline. Our ruling Besser said, ""It used to be that the only children at school who weren't vaccinated were those who had true medical"" conditions, but ""now there are 19 states that allow personal belief exemptions."" Besser, a pediatrician, is right about the number of states that allow exemptions to state vaccination laws for personal beliefs. But his history lesson about vaccination laws of yesteryear is not as accurate. States have consistently provided religious exemptions alongside medical exemptions, and five predominantly Midwestern states allowed parents to seek exemptions for any reason even in the 1960s. His claim is partially accurate, so we rate the claim Half True. Clarification: This post has been updated to better reflect how Elena Conis said the modern anti-vaccine movement began.",/factchecks/2015/feb/01/richard-besser/abc-expert-19-states-now-allow-personal-exemption-/
