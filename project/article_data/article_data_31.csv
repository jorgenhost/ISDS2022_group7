Tucker Carlson’s conspiracy theory about FBI and Jan. 6 continues to be wrong
","A debunked conspiracy theory that claims federal agents incited the Jan. 6 Capitol riot is making a new appearance in Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s new three-part documentary series, ""Patriot Purge."" The controversial series that started airing Nov. 1 attempts to frame the insurrection as a false flag arranged by the federal government to ensnare American citizens who supported former President Donald Trump. The video is available on Fox News’ subscription-based streaming service ""Fox Nation,"" but it’s not being aired on the Fox News channel. ""Most Americans probably assume the chaos on Jan. 6 was the result of intelligence failures or of simple government incompetence. But direct incitement by federal agents? The intentional entrapment of American citizens? No decent person wants to believe that. But increasingly there’s evidence it is true,"" Carlson claimed at the close of the first segment. Carlson is wrong. There is no credible evidence behind this theory, and Carlson’s piece doesn’t present any. PolitiFact reached out to Fox News but did not hear back. The FBI declined to comment. The first time we saw this claim from Carlson, he based it on reporting by Revolver News, a right-leaning website. In a June 14 article, headlined, ""Unindicted Co-Conspirators in 1/6 Cases Raise Disturbing Questions of Federal Foreknowledge,"" Revolver speculated that because there were unindicted, unnamed co-conspirators included in some of the Capitol rioters’ federal charging documents, it was reasonable to assume that those people are FBI informants or agents. Carlson returned to Revolver as a source for his documentary series, interviewing Darren Beattie, who runs Revolver News and is a former Trump White House speechwriter who was fired in 2018 after he appeared on a panel with a white nationalist. In the video, Beattie made conspiratorial claims connecting the foiled October 2020 plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to the notion that the FBI orchestrated the insurrection, because informants and undercover FBI operatives were involved. Beattie referenced Steven D’Antuono, the former director of the Detroit FBI field office, who was promoted to help lead the FBI’s Washington, D.C., office after his team successfully thwarted the Whitmer kidnapping. D’Antuono is now working on the Capitol riot cases. The film suggested this is suspicious, and Beattie reiterated his website’s reporting that D’Antuono was ""quietly"" promoted. The suggestion ignores that the FBI issued a press release about the news and local media wrote stories about it. The comparison between Jan. 6 and the Whitmer plot is fraught. The plan in Michigan was never carried out, as is the case with most schemes that involve undercover agents and result in criminal charges.  Carlson cites reporting from journalist Trevor Aaronson on FBI stings that were used to to entrap Muslims after 9/11 to support his theory that the same was done to Trump supporters at the Capitol. But back in June, when Carlson first used Aaronson’s research in one of his segments, Aaronson responded in an article and said the Fox News host distorted his reporting. ""While it is true that the FBI has since 9/11 set up hundreds of Muslims in counterterrorism stings, providing weapons and sometimes the ideas for plots, I have seen zero evidence to suggest that Jan. 6 was part of a plot engineered by the FBI,"" Aaronson told PolitiFact in an email. ""What's more, the scale of the Capitol riot, involving hundreds of people from all over the country, makes the suggestion that this was some FBI plot absolutely ludicrous.""  Carlson also claimed that a former DEA agent, Mark Ibrahim, was ""strongly encouraged"" to go inside the Capitol building by an unnamed FBI informant friend who had invited him to the rally. Carlson presents no evidence for this, and court documents show the friend denied urging Ibrahim to go inside. The friend told investigators Ibrahim had concocted the story and went to the rally to promote himself after submitting an intent to resign from the DEA. The witness also told federal agents they were not at the Capitol in any formal capacity for the FBI.  Meanwhile, Ibrahim wasn’t indicted for ""simply being near the Capitol,"" as Carlson asserted in the series. Court documents show Ibrahim faces charges for bringing a firearm onto restricted grounds and for making false statements to federal agents. Others who appeared in the series claimed that so-called ""professional agitators"" were there that day to tip things into chaos and were seen changing clothes. They pointed to the involvement of John Sullivan, who has been charged in the riot and is one of the only defendants who has been identified as supporting left-wing causes at times. But there is no evidence that Sullivan is connected to antifa, the FBI or the federal government or that he single-handedly caused the riot. While there may have been individuals who were trying to quell passions, it’s clear from court filings in hundreds of cases that the people who were instigating violence were largely Trump supporters. In the video, Carlson used other people, some of whom are charged in the riot, to bolster his argument. One person claimed that the Capitol police were simply letting everyone in the building in order to intentionally entrap them. But the film didn’t acknowledge that law enforcement were vastly outnumbered. One officer died the following day, and four more have died since by suicide. Jesse Norris, a criminal justice professor at the State University of New York at Fredonia who researches entrapment incidents in terrorism prosecutions, told us that in order to show that those charged in Jan. 6 were directly incited or entrapped, Carlson would need to have evidence that undercover police or informants — who were working at the behest of law enforcement at the time — were involved in the planning of violence at the Capitol, or the instigation of violence while the protests were underway.  He would also need to show, Norris added, that the perpetrators were not already predisposed to commit the same crimes without the informants' influence. ""From a common-sense point of view, they were entrapped if the informants got them to do something they wouldn't have realistically done on their own,"" Norris said.  ""The legal definition is narrower,"" he added. ""Under federal law, someone is only entrapped if 1) the informant induced someone to commit a crime, and the inducement is more than just providing an opportunity and also includes some kind of pressure, and 2) the defendant was not already predisposed in some way to commit the same kinds of crimes before meeting the informant."" Factors used by courts and juries to decide whether a defendant was predisposed include such things as their criminal history, whether they were initially reluctant but were convinced by persistent inducement attempts, whether the idea for the crime originated with the informant, and the types of inducements used to persuade the defendant to commit the crime. Ira Robbins, a law and justice professor at American University who has studied and written about unindicted co-conspirators, said Carlson’s statements don’t hold up to scrutiny.  ""Where is the hard evidence going to the elements of entrapment?"" Robbins said. ""Did government agents originate the plan? Were they dealing with innocent individuals who didn't plan or were not involved in criminal activity? Without evidence going directly to these elements, Carlson's assertions are mere hyperbole and rhetoric. What plays well on TV doesn't usually play well in a court of law."" Meanwhile, even Fox News journalists have issued reports that dispute the conspiracy theory that the FBI helped instigate the riot. Days before Carlson’s film was released, a Fox News’ segment about the congressional investigation into the insurrection aired on ""Special Report With Bret Baier."" The segment included an interview with former CIA officer Marc Polymeropoulos, who dismissed the suggestion that Jan. 6 was a false flag. ""One of the things with false flag operations as well, is sometimes it’s used by conspiracy theorists to actually hide the truth,"" he said. ""Pretty far-fetched — in no way was Jan. 6 a false flag operation."" Carlson claims that federal agents directly incited people on Jan. 6 and ""intentionally entrapped"" American citizens. There is no evidence that the FBI, or any other government agency, orchestrated or incited the Jan. 6 riot.  We rate this statement False.

Experts say COVID-19 vaccines are safe for children, reject misleading claims about CDC graph
","Moments after Gov. Gavin Newsom announced plans last month to mandate COVID-19 vaccination for all California schoolchildren, a graph often used to share misleading narratives on vaccinations started spreading across social media.  ""This is the chart [for] 6-17 year olds for ALL VACCINES for all reactions over 30 years ... and @GavinNewsom says the covid vaccine is the same as all the others,"" the tweet in early October, from a poster who does not appear to live in California, read.  The tweet was shared more than 250 times. Screenshots quickly made their way to Facebook, where one poster urged parents to ""follow the science"" and ""ask the questions."" ""They don't want people to know they are using our kids as science experiments,"" one commenter wrote on the post. Reacting to the post on Twitter, one commenter falsely described the vaccine as ""a bioweapon."" In fact, the COVID-19 vaccines have undergone rigorous safety testing and federal health officials say they are safe and effective.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention graph includes unverified reports submitted by the general public to the federal government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System database, dating back to 1990 for children ages six to 17. The chart spikes in 2021, with more than 22,000 reports logged at the time screenshots of the CDC graph were shared on social media in early October. It’s a real graph produced by the CDC. But does it prove COVID-19 vaccinations are unsafe for children, as the social media posts suggest? With the CDC recommending this week that all children ages 5 through 11 get a low-dose COVID-19 vaccine, PolitiFact California decided to find out. The VAERS database was established in 1990 and is run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the agency that conducts public health research and issues guidance, and the Food and Drug Administration, which is tasked with monitoring new medications. Researchers use it to collect data and assess vaccine safety. They analyze  database reports to identify after-effects in new vaccines, find patient risk factors and monitor existing vaccinations. When dealing with severe adverse events, staff members may follow-up with reporting parties and ask for the patient’s medical records to learn more about what happened.  Healthcare providers and vaccine manufacturers are mandated to report adverse events to the database. But VAERS is open to everyone, so many reports also come from the public. The CDC encourages people to report adverse events after vaccination to the database, ""even if it is not clear that the vaccine caused the adverse event."" Because of this, the database website cautions that VAERS data should be interpreted with these limitations in mind. ""The number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated with vaccines,"" the VAERS website states. There have been approximately 24,000 reports to the database so far this year. But those reports are not just for children who received a COVID-19 vaccination.  The graph shows reports tied to all childhood vaccines, so some are not related to COVID-19 vaccinations. Still, most of the reports – about 22,000 – cite a COVID-19 shot. Experts say there are a variety of reasons why that number might be so high. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Children’s Hospital in Sacramento, said as vaccine hesitancy has risen in recent years, reports to the database have gone up. ""When a new vaccine comes out and the anti-vaccine lobby starts to attack it, then there is a spike in VAERS reports,"" Blumberg said. ""We saw this most dramatically with HPV vaccine approval and all the pushback against the manufacturer trying to push through school mandates in many states. And it seems reasonable to expect the same with COVID vaccines, especially considering how everything related to COVID has become politicized."" Blumberg also said publicity and media coverage drive reports to the database. ""There is more awareness to report any possible vaccine reactions,"" he said. ""Anyone can make a report, medical professionals or parents."" David Lo, a professor of biomedical sciences and senior associate dean of research at UC Riverside’s School of Medicine, stressed that the large number of reports does not mean COVID-19 vaccines are harmful. ""Any drug or vaccine is continually monitored for safety,"" Lo said. ""The safety profile of vaccines continues to be very strong, and testing and monitoring are especially rigorous."" To be approved for children, COVID-19 vaccines have to go through a lengthy process. After initial research and development, vaccinations are tested in humans in three phases, each with an increasing number of people. Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the only COVID-19 vaccination approved for children under the age of 16. In October, the FDA granted it emergency use authorization. That means it followed an expedited process to approval because of the public health emergency the pandemic triggered. But it doesn’t mean the process skipped important steps or ignored safety measures. For emergency use authorization, vaccines must  meet the FDA’s standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality. Pfizer-BioNTech submitted a study of 2,264 subjects to the FDA before receiving approval for its vaccine to be used in 12 to 15-year-olds. About half of the study participants received the vaccine and half received a placebo. Among study participants that received the vaccine, the immune response against COVID-19 was at least as high as that of young adults, and adverse effects were also comparable to older age groups. The most common symptoms were fatigue, fever, headache, chills and injection-site pain, which usually occurred after participants received the second dose of the vaccine.  Out of the roughly 1,100 people who received the vaccine in the study, five serious adverse events were reported, but all were determined to be unrelated to the vaccination. ""These serious adverse events encompassed medical events occurring at a frequency similar to that in the general population aged 12–15 years, with none considered to be related to vaccination,"" the study reads. ""No specific safety concerns were identified among adolescent vaccine recipients."" Two months after the study, none of the vaccinated participants had gotten ill with COVID-19. Eighteen of the people in the placebo group had contracted the virus. Pfizer recently completed a similar study of 5 to 11-year-old children, and received emergency use authorization in young children from the FDA earlier this week. That decision was affirmed by the CDC on Tuesday evening, clearing the way for children to begin receiving shots. The study of more than 4,600 children worldwide showed more than 90% protection against symptomatic COVID-19 among young children, who will receive one-third the dose of adults. In the trial, young children were less likely to experience side effects like fever than older children, teenagers and adults. Lo said the ""hard facts"" of the Pfizer studies, particularly the results that show the vaccine’s effectiveness, should assure parents that the shot is safe for children and motivate them to get their kids vaccinated. Concerns have been raised about the COVID-19 vaccine’s connection to young people developing myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle. NPR reported the CDC has confirmed 877 cases of myocarditis after administration of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine in people age 30 or younger, but there have been no deaths, said Dr. Matthew Oster, who studies myocarditis for the CDC and is a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. He explained that COVID-19 itself can cause MIS-C, a type of myocarditis, and other heart-related issues. ""The bottom line is getting COVID, I think, is much riskier to the heart than getting this vaccine,"" Oster said. The initial tweet and subsequent Facebook posts suggested that COVID-19 vaccines are not safe for children and displayed a graph of data from the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. The VAERS database is intended to collect data on adverse events after vaccination that may or may not be linked to the vaccine a person received. Experts analyze and verify those reports to identify trends in after-effects and patient risk factors, as well as monitor vaccines that have been available for decades. The database includes a disclaimer that says the number of reports about a specific vaccine should not be used to draw conclusions about vaccine safety. Experts say that as the anti-vaccination movement has grown in recent years, the database has seen increasing numbers of misleading reports. More publicity of the database has also contributed to more people reporting adverse events. Experts say COVID-19 vaccinations are tested rigorously and monitored as they are released to the public. Furthermore, scientific studies of thousands of children have determined that serious adverse events after vaccination are rare and that vaccinations are effective against COVID-19. While the graph is a real representation of reports submitted to VAERS, the social media posts have greatly distorted its meaning and falsely suggested that the COVID-19 vaccines are harmful for children. Therefore, we rate the posts Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A392D40>],/factchecks/2021/nov/03/facebook-posts/experts-say-covid-19-vaccines-are-safe-children-re/

2008 quote does not reflect scientific consensus: Humans do cause global warming
","During the U.N’s global summit on climate change in Scotland, Facebook users shared a viral image claiming that global warming occurs naturally, and that humans are not part of the cause. The image contains a photo of a man and this quote, attributed to Dr. David Bellamy: ""Global warming is part of (a) natural cycle and there’s nothing we can actually do to stop these cycles. The world is now facing spending a vast amount of money in tax to try to solve a problem that doesn’t actually exist."" The posts, including one by a Facebook page named  ""Climate Change is Crap,"" were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo is of Bellamy, an English botanist who died in 2019. The scientist and onetime TV broadcaster uttered the quote in a 2008 interview, where he reiterated his opinion that warming is not man made. The current scientific consensus is that humans do cause climate change.  It dates back at least to when PolitiFact began fact-checking such claims in 2007, when we found that the overwhelming consensus among climate scientists was that humans are the main cause of global warming. In a landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released Aug. 9, 234 authors relying on more than 14,000 studies said ""it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.""  The report said that it has ""high confidence"" that the main driver of increased frequency and intensity of hot extremes experienced over most land regions since the 1950s is human-induced climate change.  It is also ""likely,"" the report said, that human influence has resulted in a greater frequency of concurrent heatwaves and droughts on the global scale, fires in some regions and compound flooding in some places. NASA explains the consensus around human contributions to climate change this way: ""Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that human activities are the primary cause of the observed climate-warming trend over the past century,"" and multiple studies ""show that 97% or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities."" NASA explains that the Earth’s climate has changed throughout history and, over 800,000 years, most of those changes are due to small variations in the Earth’s orbit, which affects how much solar energy the planet receives. But today’s trends are not a result of just variations to Earth’s orbit. NASA says there’s a greater than 95% probability that most of the current warming trend is the result of human activity since the mid-20th century. Increased levels of so-called greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, cause the Earth to warm by blocking heat from escaping the atmosphere and radiating it back toward the Earth’s surface.  Carbon dioxide can be released through, say, volcanic eruptions, but humans have also increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide by 47% since the Industrial Revolution started. Methane can likewise be produced through both natural sources and human activities, such as agriculture and livestock manure management. ""Human activities are changing the natural greenhouse,"" NASA says. ""Over the last century the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, the clearing of land for agriculture, industry and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases."" A viral image claims: ""Global warming is part of (a) natural cycle and there’s nothing we can actually do to stop these cycles."" The quote is from an English botanist from 2008. It does not reflect the current scientific consensus, which is that human activity does contribute to global warming.

Why Roger Stone’s claim about 'phantom voters' in Florida is wrong
","Republican operative Roger Stone is among the supporters of former President Donald Trump who want an ""audit"" of Florida election results even though Trump won there. ""If Florida Governor Ron DeSantis does not order an audit of the 2020 election to expose the fact that there are over 1 million phantom voters on the Florida rolls in the Sunshine State I may be forced to seek the Libertarian party nomination for governor (of) Florida in 2022,"" Stone said on Oct. 31 on Gab, a social media platform for conservatives. Stone told us in a text message that he was referring to the findings by Defend Florida, a group connected to a national group of Trump allies, Defend Our Union, formed after the 2020 election. But experts on election administration say the group’s methodology and conclusions are flawed. Defend Florida members went door to door to look for ""phantom votes"" cast by people who are deceased, did not live at their listed addresses or else had listed addresses that weren’t  residential. They also came up with a number of what they called ""ghost registrations"" held by people who are dead or had similarly problematic addresses.  ""There is no such term as a ‘phantom voter’ or ‘ghost registration,’"" said Thessalia Merivaki, a political scientist at Mississippi State University. ""These seem made up and aimed to sensationalize the voter list maintenance process."" ​​Stone, who advised Trump early in his 2016 presidential campaign, was convicted in 2019 on several counts that involved lying to Congress about the 2016 election. Trump commuted Stone’s sentence in July 2020 and then pardoned him in December.  Stone’s push for an ""audit"" of Florida’s election is in spite of the fact that Trump won the state by about 372,000 votes, or 3 percentage points. And not many Republican leaders in Florida share Stone’s view on the need for an audit. After the 2020 election, DeSantis called Florida a model for the rest of the nation and in October said that the state election audits ""passed with flying colors."" Florida’s secretary of state, a DeSantis appointee, told the Tampa Bay Times the vote tally was ""accurate, transparent, and conducted in compliance with Florida law."" This summer, Defend Florida searched for invalid registrations, knocking on doors and combing state data, the Tampa Bay Times found. ""What method did you use to vote in the last election?"" they said they asked the voters they encountered. ""Did you receive any extra ballots in the mail?"" The group said that as of Oct. 27, it attempted to contact 18,547 registered voters and successfully gathered information on 9,946. Defend Florida said it found that 13% were ""phantom voters"" — ballots cast by deceased people, folks who did not live at the address listed or else had addresses that weren’t residential.  Defend Florida extrapolated based on those findings and said that of the 11.1 million Florida votes cast in November 2020 there were about 1.4 million ""phantom votes."" That’s what the group’s website showed when we accessed it Nov. 1. Caroline Wetherington, a co-founder of Defend Florida and Trump supporter, directed us to a statement on the organization’s website that says that the majority of ""phantom votes"" were cast by mail.  Merivaki and fellow political science professor Barry Burden at the University of Wisconsin-Madison both told PolitiFact they found flaws with the group’s methodology. ""The main problem is that the canvassers are visiting residences up to a year after the election,"" Burden said. ""Even if the voter file was perfectly accurate on Election Day 2020, things would have changed since then. People move, die, and change their names."" The second problem is that Defend Florida doesn’t explain how it chose the 31 counties or the areas where they canvassed. When we asked Wetherington for specifics, her response provided no additional insight: ""We canvassed homes of registered voters and obtained the status of 9,946 registered voters. Some voted in the 2020 election and some did not."" Election supervisors who have been contacted by Defend Florida said they feel the activists don’t understand how election laws work. Brian Corley, Pasco County’s supervisor of elections, in August received a letter from the group that read, in part, ""We are calling on you to clean your voter rolls immediately of those voters who have not voted in 8 years.""  Corley asked them to provide the specific voter information but said he didn’t get a response.  Election officials can’t remove someone from voter rolls for simply not voting. Citizens have a right not to vote, as many do in every election, said Marion County Supervisor of Elections Wesley Wilcox, a Republican who also serves as president of the Florida Supervisors of Elections. There are specific criteria in election laws that explain when a voter can be removed. If a mailing is sent to a voter and returned undeliverable, the voter becomes inactive. If the voter is inactive for two federal election cycles, then the voter becomes ineligible. County election officials regularly receive data about deaths and felony convictions from state offices which they use to update their voter rolls. Florida is also a member of ERIC, a consortium of states that share data to help each other remove voters who have died or moved. Mike Bennett, supervisor of elections in Manatee County and also a Republican, said the group’s information is ""completely unreliable"" and said ""the whole thing is pretty phony.""  In response to news reports about citizens calling for audits, the Florida Supervisors of Elections issued an October statement defending the integrity of Florida’s elections Election officials take multiple steps to protect the integrity of voting such as verifying voters’ signatures on mail ballots and checking IDs for in-person voters. Florida law requires that all votes are cast on paper ballots and counted on certified machines that have been publicly tested. After the election, officials conduct a public audit to verify results.  Election supervisors told us that the steps they take work, and pointed to isolated examples of attempts of voter fraud. Last year a Bradenton man was arrested after officials found he tried to obtain a mail ballot on behalf of his dead wife. ""It’s not the kind of fraud people are worried about turning over a presidential election,"" Bennett said. ""His excuse was that he was ‘testing our system.’ He got caught."" One final note before we rate Stone’s statement about ""phantom voters."" Stone, who is currently a registered Republican in Fort Lauderdale, said in his Gab post that if he runs for governor in 2022 he would run as a Libertarian. But state law says that a candidate must be a registered member of the party for which he or she is seeking nomination for one year before the start of the qualifying period.  The qualifying period begins June 13, 2022, for the governor’s race. Stone said, ""There are over 1 million phantom voters on the Florida voter rolls.""  This is an unsupported claim aimed at discrediting the state’s election administration. Stone is drawing from findings by Defend Florida, a group of Trump-aligned citizens who have gone door to door in search of what they say are invalid voter registrations. While the group has shared some details of its data collection process and findings, it has been opaque about its methodology.  What it has shared suggests the group has tested only a small sample of Florida voters. Their finding also ignores that people inevitably relocate and that there are rules that govern when people can be removed from voter rolls.  Election officials take multiple steps to make sure voters are eligible to cast ballots, including that they are not dead. The statewide election officials association, which represents officials from both parties, as well as state officials have publicly said that Florida’s election was transparent and secure.

Every level of government contributes to elections, with local taking on the biggest role
","A year after the 2020 election, the presidential results in Wisconsin are still being argued about, despite a recount and court rulings confirming that Democrat Joe Biden won the state by about 20,000 votes -- a key win that helped him oust Donald Trump as president. The latest wrinkle in the debate: Just who runs elections. Consider this recent exchange on Twitter: In a series of tweets on Oct. 26, 2021, Dane County Clerk Scott McDonnell expressed frustration over one of the ongoing GOP-led reviews, in which investigators wanted to handle ballots, despite not being election officials. McDonell detailed the chain of custody of ballots, and how local officials are the only ones who are supposed to handle them, so an uncompromised record remains.  In response, the Senate Republicans tweeted: ""Dear Scott McDonell. States run elections, not the federal government.""  So who does run elections? It turns out, elections aren’t really ""run"" by either. Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the administration of elections is more like a ""marble layer cake"" of different entities that do and require different things.  The federal government does have some degree of control over elections. There are parameters laid out in federal laws and documents like the U.S. Constitution, Burden said.  For example, the presidential election is always held on the same day of the same month -- the first Tuesday in November -- for every state.  States, meanwhile, can set their own laws governing how elections are run, within the parameters of federal laws. States do things like set the time, date and manner of their own elections. They also can institute rules about when voters can register, how and when absentee ballots can be submitted and what sorts of identification is required for voters. But local government is where the primary functions of an election take place: County and municipal clerks are the ones registering voters, dealing with absentee ballot requests, mailing out ballots, setting up polling places, testing voting equipment, hiring poll workers and then actually tabulating votes on election night.  ""That’s running elections, in a way, but I would call it administering to keep clear what’s going on,"" Burden said, in reference to the role of local governments. ""That’s actually the physical handling of the election itself. But in terms of the rules of the election, or the parameters of it, there are a bunch of different levels of government involved.""  So when it comes down to it, saying that either the federal government or the state government ""runs"" elections isn’t exactly right, though they both play a role. ""It’s just not the right way to conceive of it,"" said Burden. ""It’s everybody. All those levels of government have a role to play."" Indeed, some of the primary complaints Republicans have cited over the November 2020 election relate to how local officials ran their election operations last year. So, that in itself is at odds with the claim that it’s the states that solely run an election. In a Twitter retort, Wisconsin Senate Republicans claimed that the state runs elections, not the federal government.  The tweet had no mention of local levels of government, where the bulk of the work on and before Election Day plays out -- and where the critical task of counting and certifying local totals takes place. Elections are actually governed and managed at the federal, state and local levels, which means they aren’t really ""run"" by any one part of the government. That said, the state clearly does play an important role in setting the rules for elections. We rate this claim Mostly False.     ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097015480>],/factchecks/2021/nov/03/wisconsin-senate-republicans/every-level-government-contributes-elections-local/

Greenland lost ice faster this decade than 80 years ago
","Steven Koonin, a former Obama administration official and unofficial adviser to the EPA under President Donald Trump, says the fears of rampant climate change are overblown. In a recent video for the conservative group Prager U, Koonin noted several trends that ought to reassure people. Among them, the ice in Greenland. ""Greenland's ice sheet isn't shrinking any more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago,"" said Koonin, now a New York University professor of physics. Koonin told us he based this on a widely accepted study of the Greenland ice sheet and rising sea levels. The main problem is that study only went through 2010, and ice losses have accelerated since then. There’s been a steeper and longer lasting decline in recent decades compared with the pre-World War II period Koonin mentioned. Greenland lost ice faster this decade than 80 years ago. Read the full fact-check in our bio. ##ClimateChange ##LearnOnTikTok The Greenland ice sheet is second only to the Antarctic in size, covering about 660,000 square miles. It is a key barometer of climate change, and its fate has great importance for overall sea level changes and impacts on ocean currents. Measuring Greenland’s ice involves much more than just tracking the area it covers. Researchers need to factor in the amount of snowfall that adds to its mass, and weigh that against the millions of gallons of water that evaporate into the atmosphere or melt into the water. Plus, in a process called calving, large chunks break off and drift away as icebergs. Satellites provide some of the best information to track trends in the ice, but they date back only to the early 1990s. Before then, the best data came from aerial photographs in the 1930s and 1940s. When the underlying terrain is known, scientists compare pictures over the years to tell what happened with the ice. Using historic air and sea measurements and computer models, researchers can push the estimates of the mass of the ice as far back as the mid-1800s. Koonin told us that he relied on an article about the role of melting ice on rising sea levels. The August 2020 paper noted two periods when Greenland ice added the most to the oceans — around 1940 and after about 1990. The highest amount came in 1937 when Greenland’s ice sheet caused the sea level to rise by .76 millimeters. In 2010, the ice sheet added .7 millimeters to the oceans. (Measuring rising sea levels due to the Greenland ice sheet and measuring ice loss from the sheet are two sides of the same coin.) The main issue with this data is that it stops at 2010. The latest report card for the Greenland ice sheet from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that in 2012 and 2019, the ice sheet saw its greatest losses since regular monitoring began in the 1950s. In 2012, it shed about 464 gigatons, and in 2019, it lost about 532 gigatons. According to NASA, 1 gigaton of ice would cover Central Park in New York and reach 1,119 feet high. ""Following a period of relative stability from the 1970s to early 1990s, the ice sheet began losing ice at an accelerating rate and has now experienced annual net ice loss every year since 1998,"" the report said. Many of the researchers who worked on that analysis were part of a project that pulled together multiple ways of measuring the mass of Greenland’s ice and built a tool that tracks the ice nearly in real time. They made the full data tables available and, with the help of one of those collaborators, Kristian Kjeldsen at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland in Denmark, we summarized the ice loss trends decade by decade. The overall trend is that losses have been more sustained and deeper than during the pre-WWII period that Koonin referred to in his video. All studies of the Greenland ice sheet find that the numbers bounce around a lot from year to year. Averages for each decade help smooth out the trends. Even with the best methods, pinpoint accuracy is out of reach, and the shaded areas show the high and low estimates, with the solid line showing the mid-points. The further back in time, the bigger the uncertainty. ""Some observations point to a warm period in the late 1920s and early 1930s, which coincides with glacier retreat in the southeast,"" Kjeldsen said. But he noted, after 2000, negative numbers are ""more persistent."" The 1930s low point of 206 gigatons of ice sheet loss is not as large as the 247 gigatons average yearly loss between 2010 and 2020.  We counted the years of continuous decline. The current stretch of year-on-year losses since 1998 is the longest this century. (We reworked the yearly numbers several ways, looking at five-year periods and average changes during periods of ice loss. The overall trends remained the same.)  Researcher Twila Moon, deputy lead scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, said the tons of ice lost today actually are more significant than losses in the 1930s. Back then, the ice sheet was bigger. ""After losing ice in the earlier part of the 20th century, the ice sheet did not expand back to its previous mass and shape,"" Moon said. ""So as warming air and ocean temperatures arrived in the later part of the 20th century, the ice loss was picking up from a different starting point."" We shared the latest numbers with Koonin, and he highlighted the uncertainties in the estimates. By his calculations, there’s about a 40% chance that the losses were greater in the 1930s than in the 2010s. There are different ways to calculate the odds. Andrew Dessler, professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, estimated that there’s about a 25% chance that the losses were greater in the 1930s than in the 2010s.  In either scenario, using either estimate, that would mean there’s a greater chance the ice losses were greater in the 2010s than the 1930s. Koonin said that ""Greenland's ice sheet isn't shrinking any more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago."" Koonin relied on a study that had data through 2010. Experts agree that a period of warmer temperatures caused a large loss of ice in the 1930s. But the most recent data shows a period of steeper and longer lasting declines in the Greenland ice sheet between 2010 and 2020 than in the period 80 years ago. There is uncertainty in the data, but Koonin’s numbers are incomplete and obscure the scale of recent ice losses. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097363B40>],/factchecks/2021/nov/03/steven-koonin/greenland-lost-ice-faster-decade-80-years-ago/

In Glasgow, Joe Biden exaggerates on wages, inflation
","President Joe Biden defended his record on the U.S. economy while attending the international climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland.  Biden entered the United Nations’ COP 26 summit facing supply chain challenges and high levels of inflation back home. At a press conference, he said the U.S. is still in a better place than a year ago, when the coronavirus pandemic limited family gatherings and hampered the economy. ""This Thanksgiving, we're all in a very different circumstance,"" Biden said on Nov. 2. ""Things are a hell of a lot better, and the wages have gone up higher, faster than inflation."" On inflation and wages, Biden has a point for the most recent two months — August and September 2021. However, inflation outpaced wages by so much earlier in his presidency that these two months haven’t changed the overall picture much. All told, Americans are worse off on the comparison of inflation and wages than they were roughly a year ago. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) We looked at two common metrics: the consumer price index for inflation, and average hourly earnings at private employers. Specifically, we compared the current levels of both measurements to their levels in December 2020, right before Biden took office. During that period, inflation increased by 4.8%. Wages haven’t risen that fast; they’ve increased by 3.1%.   ""In recent months, consumer prices have been climbing faster than wages for the wage and salary workforce as a whole,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. Biden is on safer ground for the most recent two months for which data is available. In August, inflation rose by 0.27% over the previous month, while wages rose by 0.36%. And in September, inflation rose by 0.41%, while wages rose by 0.62%. In every previous month during his presidency, inflation outpaced wages.   ""The statement about wages being up more than inflation does depend on your baseline,"" said Nick Bunker, economic research director for North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab. Biden said that ""wages have gone up higher, faster than inflation."" That was the case in August and September. But the gains from those two months are only starting to dig inflation-adjusted wages out of the hole they fell into during the first seven months of Biden’s tenure.

Tucker Carlson film falsely claims Jan. 6 is ‘pretext to strip millions’ of ‘constitutional rights’
","In the first part of Tucker Carlson’s controversial and conspiratorial documentary series attempting to rewrite the events of Jan. 6, the Fox News host claimed that the attack on the U.S. Capitol is being used as a front to justify a ""purge"" of Donald Trump voters and a new war on terror. The series started airing Nov. 1 on Fox Nation, Fox News’ subscription streaming service. It was produced as part of a multiyear deal Carlson signed to make specials for Fox Nation, and it was co-written by Scooter Downey, who previously directed films for far-right figures. On Fox News’ flagship morning show, ""Fox & Friends,"" Carlson defended the series as ""rock-solid factually."" Yet the first installment of the three-part documentary, titled ""Patriot Purge,"" advances several conspiracy theories about the insurrection, including that the violence of the day was spurred on by left-wing instigators and agent provacateurs in disguise, and that the siege may have been a trap orchestrated by the FBI. It also includes sympathetic interviews with conservatives involved in the day’s events, such as ""Stop the Steal"" organizer Ali Alexander. The film opens with a video montage juxtaposing footage and commentary related to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the Abu Ghraib prison, Guantanamo Bay and Islamic terrorism with footage and commentary about Jan. 6 and the government’s prosecution of the rioters. Elijah Schaffer of BlazeTV, a conservative outlet, is heard describing the Jan. 6 charges as ""political persecution."" A little more than two minutes in, Carlson took over the screen, saying: ""In the years after 9/11, the media and the national security state used exaggerated threats and outright deception to associate certain ideas with certain events. This was the first war on terror. Now, it’s happening again.  ""The very same corrupt interests in Washington that pushed the Iraq War under false pretenses are now pushing the lie of a domestic white terror. They are tying white nationalist terrorism to Trump voters. They’re tying Jan. 6 to 9/11. They’re tying millions of law abiding Americans to al-Qaida and ISIS. Jan. 6 is being used as a pretext to strip millions of Americans — disfavored Americans — of their core constitutional rights, and to defame them as domestic terrorists."" Carlson provided no evidence to explain how ""millions of Americans"" are getting stripped of their ""core constitutional rights."" Regardless, the claim is far from accurate. And the hundreds of charges brought after Jan. 6 were handed down to people who broke laws as they stormed the Capitol, clashed with police and disrupted congressional proceedings in an effort to overturn the 2020 election results. Most were Trump supporters.  Supporters of President Donald Trump try to break through a police barrier at the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021. (AP) ""I’m not aware of anyone being stripped of constitutional rights because of alleged involvement in the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, let alone ‘millions’ of people,"" said David Alan Sklansky, professor of law and faculty co-director of the Criminal Justice Center at Stanford Law School. ​​Fox News did not offer a comment for this fact-check.  Nine months after the violent and deadly attack, the Justice Department has arrested about 650 people for involvement, including on charges related to destroying or stealing property, carrying firearms or other weapons, assaulting officers, obstructing official proceedings, and conspiracy. The case details are often spelled out in publicly available arrest warrants turned over to judges. More than 85% of those people were charged in part using evidence from their own or others’ social media accounts, according to George Washington University. Some live streamed their participation in the day’s events, while others defended or boasted about it on social media. The riot also included members of some white supremacist groups, along with members of far-right extremist militia organizations like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. But there’s no evidence that anywhere close to the 74 million people who voted in 2020 for Trump have been stripped of constitutional rights post-Jan. 6. An estimated 2,000 to 2,500 people entered the Capitol on Jan. 6, according to the Washington Post. One- to two-thirds of them, then, have not been arrested. And among those who have, the arrests haven’t extended beyond the people who were involved that day. Even among those charged, there’s no evidence that their constitutional rights are under threat, said Michael Jensen, a senior researcher at the University of Maryland’s National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. ""Nor are there any legal proceedings, legislative debates, or law enforcement actions underway that could result in that outcome.""  Supporters of President Donald Trump climb the west wall of the the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington. (AP) A federal judge in October referred a D.C. jail to the Justice Department after finding that it failed to turn over information needed to approve surgery for a defendant’s broken wrist. Some Jan. 6 rioters have also spent time in solitary confinement, PolitiFact reported in July.  But as PolitiFact reported at that time, the vast majority of the Jan. 6 defendants have been released from custody while awaiting trial. ""More than 90% of the individuals who have been charged for participating in the insurrection have been granted release pending trial,"" Jensen said, citing the Justice Department’s public database of cases stemming from Jan. 6.  Of those who have pleaded guilty and been sentenced, only a handful have been set to serve any time in jail, Jensen said, and most will serve only 45 days. ""These are hardly draconian criminal justice outcomes,"" Jensen said. Nationwide, a significantly lower rate of federal defendants are released pretrial. And an August analysis from the Associated Press countered conservative claims that the pro-Trump rioters on Jan. 6 have experienced harsher treatments than protesters arrested over the summer of 2020.  People sentenced in international terrorism cases often face 15-year prison terms and years of restrictions after prison, by contrast, Jensen said. ""It's ridiculous to compare the post-Jan. 6 investigation and prosecutions to what happened after 9/11. People were held without charges post-9/11. People were tortured,"" added Sklansky, the Stanford Law School professor. ""There is nothing remotely equivalent to that happening."" In ""Patriot Purge: Part 2,"" released Nov. 2, Carlson furthered the same theme, telling viewers there is ""a new war on terror"" focused on ""hunting down American citizens, purging them from society, and throwing some of them into solitary confinement."" He claimed that the government’s response to Jan. 6 is really ""a purge aimed at the legacy Americans"" and ""inconvenient citizens who vote the wrong way."" And he warned, ""It took a decade for the federal government to find Osama bin Laden. They can find you a lot faster. They likely already have."" In his film, Carlson said, ""Jan. 6 is being used as a pretext to strip millions of Americans — disfavored Americans — of their core constitutional rights.""  There is no evidence that the hundreds of people arrested for participating in the assault on the Capitol have been stripped of their constitutional rights, let alone that millions of Trump supporters are also under threat of losing their rights. There is also nothing pretextual about the prosecutions, which have targeted only those who breached the Capitol, assaulted police or committed other crimes during what was an historic attempt to overturn an election. Many rioters posted about their involvement on social media.

Carlson's Jan. 6 documentary doesn’t tell full story about former DEA agent
","In a new conspiratorial documentary series about the Jan. 6 insurrection, Fox News host Tucker Carlson makes an array of dubious claims over an ominous soundtrack, cutting away to sympathetic interviews with people who he says have been unfairly targeted since the Capitol attack.  Carlson’s film attempts to rewrite the history of Jan. 6 with wild, unsupported claims that the U.S. government is using the day’s events to entrap Americans who voted for former President Donald Trump.  In part two of the three-part ""Patriot Purge"" series, Carlson tells a story about a man named Mark Ibrahim — a former agent with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration who faces multiple charges in the Capitol breach. Ibrahim, 32, is shown running along the Arlington Memorial Bridge with his dog and completing a tactical training course. Then Carlson claims: ""DEA agent Mark Ibrahim was forced from his job and later indicted simply because he was near the Capitol protest on Jan. 6.""  This is wrong.  Court documents show that Ibrahim had already submitted his intent to resign from the DEA weeks before Jan. 6. He was considered a probationary employee on leave from the agency the day of the insurrection. Ibrahim was indicted on federal charges because investigators found he brought a gun with him onto Capitol grounds and then made false statements to federal agents in a recorded interview. None of these details are mentioned in Carlson’s piece. PolitiFact reached out to Fox News for comment but did not hear back. A DEA spokesperson confirmed that Ibrahim is no longer employed with the agency but did not provide further details. Carlson’s documentary claims that Ibrahim was invited to the Capitol by a friend —  an FBI informant attending the day’s events to assist the FBI.  Carlson repeats this claim, saying that the friend ""strongly encouraged"" Ibrahim to go inside the Capitol. ""Ibrahim knew it was illegal so he refused to do it,"" Carlson says in the video. ""Mark Ibrahim now faces 15 years in federal prison."" Federal investigators interviewed the friend, who is not named in the court filing, and heard a different story that is not disclosed in Carlson’s piece. The friend said Ibrahim crafted the story to ""cover his a--"" and went to the rally in order to promote himself in preparation for launching a possible ""Liberty Tavern"" political podcast and cigar brand, court documents said. The friend told investigators they were not at the Capitol in any formal capacity for the FBI. Carlson doesn’t mention any details about Ibrahim’s charges, which include making a false statement and carrying a firearm on restricted grounds.  While Ibrahim did not enter the Capitol, investigators say he climbed onto Peace Monument, which is located on the Capitol grounds, to film himself as he delivered a ""monologue"" and presented several photos that show Ibrahim posing while flashing his DEA badge and firearm. He also sent photos of himself at the Capitol to a group chat on WhatsApp that included at least five other law enforcement officers, according to court documents.   In a recorded interview, Ibrahim admitted to federal investigators that he was at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and that he had his DEA credentials with him, as well as his badge and firearm. He said, ""I had my creds. I had my firearm, and my badge on me … But never exposed … Not that I know of."" Pictures show that to be false. He was arrested in July 2021 and faces charges that include entering or remaining in a restricted building or on Capitol grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and making false statements. Carlson said Ibrahim was ""forced"" from his DEA job and ""later indicted simply because he was near the Capitol protest on Jan. 6.""  Court documents show that Ibrahim had been a probationary DEA employee on leave on Jan. 6 and had given a notice of his intent to resign from the agency several weeks earlier. He was indicted for bringing a firearm on Capitol grounds and for making false statements to federal agents, not ""simply because he was near the Capitol.""

Did violent crime in W.Va. fall after permitless carry was enacted?
","Did West Virginia’s passage of a permitless open carry law for guns produce a precipitous drop in violent crime in the state? That’s what an image on Facebook said. In 2016, West Virginia lawmakers passed a law that allowed most individuals over the age of 21 to carry a firearm without a permit or safety training. When the law was passed, some critics warned that it would lead to an increase in violent crime. ""Violent crime rate dropped like a rock following West Virginia’s adoption of permitless carry,"" said the Sept. 20 post, which was attributed to a group called Clergy in Support of the Second Amendment. An accompanying chart shows violent crime rates for the United States and West Virginia, with a drop for the U.S. but a bigger decline for West Virginia after the law was passed. ""Every time a state has expanded the right to carry firearms for self defense, gun control groups have predicted a massive increase in violent crime and murder as a result,"" the post goes on to say. ""Not once has this happened."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) When we looked at the crime rate in West Virginia after the law was passed, we found a more complicated story. (We reached out to Clergy in Support of the Second Amendment but did not hear back.) The chart in question used statistics for the violent crime rate, which are collected annually by the FBI from local law enforcement offices. Four types of crime are included: homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery. Between 2017, the first full year after the law was in effect, and 2018, the number of violent crimes did decrease by about 60 per 100,000 people. However, the chart in the post stops at 2018, and that means it is cherry-picked to leave out a subsequent increase in violent crime, with data that was available at the time the post was published. In both 2019 and 2020, violent crime went up, and the rate now stands around the same level as it was before the decrease.    Meanwhile, criminologists cautioned that the violent crime rate is a blunt statistic for measuring gun crimes. ""The vast majority of violent crime are aggravated assaults,"" said James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminologist. ""Many of these are domestic or involve acquaintances. This would not be impacted"" by a permitless carry law. Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at University of Central Florida whose research focuses on homicide and violent crime, agreed. He said most aggravated assaults do not get reported, and that rape statistics are unreliable.  He said that homicide rates may be a better statistic, although not a perfect one. ""For homicide, you’ve got a body,"" said Corzine. ""That calls for an investigation."" So how did the homicide rate change in West Virginia after passage of the law? The statewide homicide rate decreased slightly in 2018, before increasing during the next two years. (The national homicide rate also increased over the same period.)   Looking at the data this way, Corzine said, ""I don’t see any reason to believe the law had an impact."" The post said that ""violent crime rate dropped like a rock following West Virginia’s adoption of permitless carry."" This is a selective representation of the data. After an initial decline in 2017 and 2018, violent crime rose again in 2019 and 2020 and is now back around its level prior to the law being passed. In addition, experts say that the violent crime rate is an imperfect statistic to use for tracking gun crimes. Another statistic, the homicide rate, may be a better indicator, and it did not see the big drop in 2017 and 2018 that was found for violent crime. And like the violent crime rate in West Virginia, the homicide rate has also gone up in 2019 and 2020.

Bezos’ statistics ignore Amazon’s monopoly of U.S. e-commerce and growing international revenue
","Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos opened his recent remarks to Congress with a claim that Amazon is in an ""extraordinarily large and competitive"" market, not only in the U.S. but internationally.  Bezos cited statistics to make his point, highlighting how ""Amazon accounts for less than 1% of the $25 trillion global retail market, and less than 4% of U.S. retail."" The figures don’t tell the whole story. They include a much larger pool of retailers than Amazon is directly competing with and minimize how large Amazon’s sales are compared to the rest of worldwide retail. We reached out to Amazon’s press team to ask for Bezos’ sources for the statistics he mentioned but they didn’t respond. On a global scale, figures show Amazon made up about 1.12% of international retail sales in 2019, which is just over 1%. According to a June 2019 report from eMarketer, total international retail sales were projected to be $25 trillion by the end of 2019. In Amazon’s last 2019 quarterly report, they announced that they had made $280.5 billion in sales during the 2019 fiscal year.  For U.S. retail, Amazon does make up less than 4% of total sales, according to eMarketer. In 2019, Amazon accounted for 38.7% of U.S. e-commerce retail sales alone, and e-commerce retail sales accounted for 11.3% of the U.S. retail market by the end of 2019. Just looking at these statistics, Amazon looks like a tiny company competing in an extremely large market. However, comparing Amazon to the entire retail market is problematic. The U.S. Census Bureau includes over fifty industries in their data for the retail market, including car dealers, gas stations, full service restaurants, and liquor stores. Amazon is not directly competing with most of the industries in the U.S. retail market, but it is responsible for the largest portion — 38.7% — of total e-commerce retail sales. Its largest competitor was Walmart, with 5.3% of sales.  This gap isn’t new, in 2018 Amazon made up 47% of e-commerce retail sales and the second-ranked e-commerce company was eBay, with 6.1% of sales. Amazon is dominating the U.S. e-commerce retail market, which is also accounting for a growing share of the U.S. retail industry. The e-commerce market rose from 4.2% of the U.S. retail market in 2010 to 11.8% of the market in 2020.  Internationally, when we look at the entire world of retail (be it online or not), Amazon had the second-highest revenue of any retail seller in 2018, behind Walmart, which made $517.7 billion, according to the Kantar Group. In 2018, Walmart accounted for only 2.07% of international retail sales, despite having the most revenue from retail in the world.

Comparing the price of child care with college tuition
","In a July 29 press conference, Rep. Linda Sánchez of California joined House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats to show support for child care legislation to help businesses and families during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""The average cost of child care in this country is more than what it costs to send a child to college for one year,"" Sánchez said at the press conference. Later that day, the House passed two bills to provide funding to child care providers. Sánchez did not specify what timespan she was referring to for child care spending, and her spokesperson did not respond for comment.  We found that child care certainly isn’t cheap, and depending on how you count it, it can cost nearly as much as a year of college. But, in most cases, in a year-to-year comparison, a year of college costs more. Like many things during the pandemic, the already complicated landscape of child care has become even more difficult for families amid shutdowns.  At some point during the pandemic, half of child care programs closed, and, according to a July National Association for the Education of Young Children survey, about 40% of child care providers say they will close permanently if they don’t receive additional assistance from the government. Half of infants and toddlers and 63% of 3- to 5-year-olds were in nonparental child care in 2012, according to a 2016 survey by the Health and Human Services Department and the University of Chicago. The Cares Act, a congressional COVID-19 relief package passed in March, provided the child care industry with $3.5 billion. The Child Care Is Essential Act, which Sánchez co-sponsored, would allocate $50 billion in grants to child care providers.  A 2019 report by Child Care Aware of America, an advocacy group that provides families with child care resources, found the average price of center-based infant, toddler and 4-year-old care in each state and D.C.  PolitiFact’s analysis of the group’s numbers found that the nationwide median price of infant care is $11,107 annually. That figure falls to $10,267 for toddlers and $8,834 for 4-year-olds. By comparison, in 2017-18, the average price of tuition, fees, room and board for all four-year colleges — including public and private institutions — was $27,357, according to the U.S. Department of Education. Clearly, that’s more than what families nationwide average for one year of child care for an infant, toddler or a 4-year-old. If you look only at four-year public colleges, the total cost drops to $20,050 for a year on average, according to Education Department figures. That’s still more than the median price of one year of center-based infant, toddler or 4-year-old child care.  We should note that these college and child care figures don’t take financial assistance into account. In addition, many families depend on child care outside of centers, including through a family member or trusted friend. To be sure, there are instances when a year of child care can cost more than a year of college tuition, particularly in-state tuition for public universities. But Sánchez wasn’t that precise in her claim.  ""The average cost of child care in this country is more than what it costs to send a child to college for one year,"" Sánchez said. The nationwide median annual price of infant, toddler and 4-year-old care is much less expensive than the nationwide average of a year at a four-year college. However, a year of center-based child care is more expensive than a year of in-state public college tuition in many states. Sánchez did not specify a timeframe for her comparison. If she meant to compare the annual price of a four-year college to the amount families pay for a year of infant, toddler or 4-year-old center-based care, then her statement is incorrect. However, comparing the price of college to the price of child care over the course of a child’s lifetime would show a different picture. We rate Sánchez’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979E9E40>],/factchecks/2020/aug/06/linda-sanchez/comparing-price-child-care-college-tuition/

Yes, a Trump lawyer helped Kanye West try to get on Wisconsin’s ballot
","Kanye West this week upped the ante in an already interesting campaign season for Wisconsin. On Aug. 4, 2020, the rapper made a last-ditch effort to get on the ballot for the Nov. 3 presidential election.

""Just in case anyone needs some clarity around what’s happening here,"" Legend wrote. Joseph tweeted the statement on Aug. 4, the day signatures were due in Wisconsin. According to an article from Joseph in Vice, the person seen dropping off West’s paperwork was Lane Ruhland, a lawyer who previously worked for the Republican Party of Wisconsin. Matt Smith, a reporter for WISN in Milwaukee, tweeted a video of Ruhland walking into the state Election Commission’s building a few minutes after the 5 p.m. filing deadline.

QAnon conspiracy theorists seek to link Beirut explosion to Rothschilds
","Facebook posts from accounts connected to the QAnon conspiracy theory are wrongly blaming the Rothschilds, the influential European banking family, for the explosion at the port of Beirut. The Facebook posts falsely claim that the Rothschilds own the Central Bank of Lebanon, which has been struggling to contain the country’s spiraling financial crisis. And because the central bank’s headquarters is located just a few miles away from the site of the explosion, the posts conclude that the Aug. 4 boom was the family’s doing. ""The Beirut bombing today was directly next to the Lebanon Central Bank, which is also owned by the most evil deep state family, the Rothschilds,"" one post says. ""There are no coincidences."" ""Rothschild bank explosion in Lebanon,"" says another. ""Covering up evidence … bodies everywhere, this was premeditated, multiple explosions."" ""Don’t believe the first narrative,"" the second post adds. The two Facebook posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s start by debunking the posts’ most outlandish claim: There’s no evidence to suggest that the Rothschilds — the wealthy Jewish family that established a financial empire in Europe beginning in the 1700s — are responsible for what happened in Beirut.  Details are still emerging about the explosion, which as of this writing has left at least 135 people dead and many more wounded, displaced or unaccounted for. Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab and President Michael Aoun have pledged to investigate.  But U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Aug. 5 that ""most believe"" it ""was an accident, as reported,"" despite President Donald Trump’s suggestions that it was an ""attack."" RELATED: No evidence Israel hit Beirut with a nuclear missile Lebanese authorities said the blast took place at a warehouse along the Beirut waterfront. They have attributed it to the detonation of more than 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, a chemical commonly used in fertilizer. Diab said the stockpile had been at the warehouse for six years. It remains unclear what set off the ammonium nitrate. A fire appears to have spread with the help of fireworks also kept at the port, according to early reports. The resulting explosion registered as the equivalent of a 3.3 magnitude earthquake. Reverberations are said to have been felt as far as Cyprus, more than 100 miles away from Beirut. But what about the Central Bank of Lebanon? The Facebook posts claim that the Rothschilds own the bank, putting them in charge of a building not too far from the site of the explosion. The Facebook posts are wrong about that connection, too.  The headquarters of the Central Bank of Lebanon, or Banque du Liban, is located a few miles away from the port of Beirut, according to Google Maps. It is not ""directly next to"" the explosion site, as one Facebook post claims. Reuters reported that the building was not seriously damaged by the blast. And there’s no evidence that it’s controlled by the Rothschild family.  The Rothschilds have been a target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories for centuries, according to the Washington Post, including accusations that they control the global economy and various central banks. Supporters of QAnon have newly embraced those tropes.  But the Central Bank of Lebanon is an independent government agency. It was established on Aug. 1, 1963, according to its website, and it started to operate a year later. The central bank is currently headed by Riad Salamé, its governor since 1993. ""BDL is a legal public entity enjoying financial and administrative autonomy,"" the bank’s website says. ""Its capital is totally appropriated by the State."" As Reuters first reported, the 2019 annual report from Rothschild & Co, the family’s strongest present-day tie to banking, does not mention ownership of central banks. Only a handful of countries, including the U.S., have central banks with shareholders outside their respective governments.

Fact-checking a claim about immigrants and California’s 'extra' House seats
","All U.S. residents, including immigrants here legally or illegally, are eligible to be counted in the national census mandated by the Constitution that’s done every 10 years. Those counts determine how many U.S. House seats each state gets and, in turn, the number of electoral votes it gets in presidential elections. We found no evidence to back a claim that California has six more House seats than it would have if people in the country illegally were excluded from the apportionment. The claim ""is off base,"" said demographer Dudley Poston Jr., an emeritus professor of sociology at Texas A&M University. He and other experts say California likely has two to four more seats than it would without counting people in the country illegally. But according to the U.S. Constitution, all residents are to be counted in the census and for the purpose of apportionment, regardless of immigration or citizenship status.   On July 23 on Facebook, conservative podcast host Dan Bongino shared an article from his Bongino.com that carried this headline: ""Report: California Has Six Extra Representatives Because Illegals Are Counted in Census."" The report that article cited is actually a Facebook post published the previous day from a Facebook user called Unbiased America. It refers to the 2010 census in making the California claim. Bongino’s Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It comes as President Donald Trump seeks to exclude the count of immigrants in the country illegally in determining how the House’s 435 seats are divided up after the 2020 census. We asked Bongino via Facebook Messenger if he had any additional information we should consider in doing this fact-check. He referred us to the author of the Bongino.com article, who did not provide us any additional information. (As we prepared to publish this fact-check on Aug. 6, Bongino’s Facebook post was no longer available. A message on Facebook said: ""This Content Isn't Available Right Now. When this happens, it's usually because the owner only shared it with a small group of people, changed who can see it or it's been deleted."" We archived Bongino’s original post.) Regarding apportionment, the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not refer to citizenship or residency status with regard to counting residents. It declares:  ""Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed."" The ""Indians not taxed"" clause was made obsolete by laws that granted Native Americans U.S. citizenship. Courts have held that all people be counted.  As we’ve reported, the last time all households were asked about U.S. citizenship was in the 1950 census.  From 1970 to 2000, the Census Bureau used two questionnaires: a long form and short form. About 1 in 6 households received the long-form questionnaire, which included a question on citizenship.  The 2010 census used only a short-form questionnaire with 10 questions. It did not ask about citizenship.  ""It is impossible to know how many undocumented immigrants might have been included in the 2010 census count,"" John Weeks, director of the International Population Center at San Diego State University, told PolitiFact. The Supreme Court last year blocked an effort by the Trump administration to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, questioning its rationale.  As a result of the 2010 census, California has 53 U.S. House seats, the most of any state. Its delegation includes the House leaders of both parties: Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican. We did not find evidence to back a claim of six ""extra seats."" The Census Bureau did not provide information to PolitiFact on whether the claim is accurate.  According to estimates by the Pew Research Center, the Public Policy Institute of California and others, California has more than 2 million immigrants who are in the country illegally. Poston, who has done analyses regarding the 2000 and 2020 censuses, estimated that the counting of these immigrants in the 2010 census accounts for two or three of California’s House seats.  Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which works to reduce legal and illegal immigration, estimated three or four. Steven Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, which uses data to argue for low levels of immigration, estimated two. Another demography expert, University of Houston sociology professor Amanda Baumle, said the claim of six appears to be based on analyses of apportionment based on only U.S. citizens being counted, and not lawful permanent residents or other noncitizens with legal status. Immigrants without legal status, she estimates, account for three California seats. One of the articles cited by Unbiased America, a 2007 post by Mehlman's group, says the difference would be six if only U.S. citizens were counted. Immigration status may come into play with the outcome of the 2020 census. In July, Trump issued a memorandum directing that immigrants in the country illegally be excluded from the apportionment base following the 2020 census — that is, they would not be counted in determining how many House representatives each state gets.  ""Excluding these illegal aliens from the apportionment base is more consonant with the principles of representative democracy underpinning our system of government,"" the memo says.  Census and legal experts say such an action would be illegal and unconstitutional, and several lawsuits have been filed challenging the order. The suit filed by California and several other plaintiffs notes that all immigrants have been included since the first national census in 1790, and that the U.S. Constitution mandates that all persons be counted for apportionment. In a 2012 paper, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said ""it appears a constitutional amendment would be necessary to exclude any individuals from the census count for the purpose of apportioning House seats."" If Trump’s order withstands challenges, California, Florida and Texas would each end up with one fewer congressional seat than they would have been awarded based on population change alone; and Alabama, Minnesota and Ohio would each hold on to a seat that they would have otherwise lost, the Pew Research Center reported. A Facebook post says California has six ""extra"" U.S. House representatives because immigrants in the country illegally are counted in the census. Under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, all residents are to be counted in the census for purposes of apportionment. The amendment does not refer to legal residency status. Census and demographic experts say California would have two to four fewer seats if immigrants who are here illegally were excluded from the count used to determine apportionment of House seats.  We rate the post Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979E3540>],/factchecks/2020/aug/06/facebook-posts/calif-has-extra-us-house-seats-because-illegals-no/

Fact-checking Arizona Senate race claim about Mark Kelly, PPP loan
","In the competitive Arizona Senate race, Republican Sen. Martha McSally is taking aim at Democratic opponent Mark Kelly, claiming that he’s a hypocrite who attacked a loan program to help businesses during the pandemic and then took money from the program for his own company. ""Small businesses were hit hard by the pandemic, which is why I fought"" for the Paycheck Protection Program, McSally tweeted July 31. ""Mark Kelly criticized the program, then turned around and took money for his own multi-million dollar company."" Is McSally right about Kelly? Not really. An Arizona company that Kelly co-founded and in which he has investments did receive a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program. But Kelly’s campaign said he left the company more than a year ago and had no role in the company’s application for the coronavirus pandemic relief. Moreover, Kelly’s criticism of the program centered on Congress and the red tape that he said was preventing deserving small businesses in Arizona from getting aid. His public statements show that he wasn’t against the program itself. McSally, a former U.S. House member and retired Air Force pilot, is vying to hold on to a Senate seat she was appointed to after the resignation of Sen. John Kyl. Kelly is a retired U.S. Navy pilot and astronaut. Both easily won primary elections on Aug. 4. Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses affected by the pandemic. The program was established by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, signed into law in March by President Donald Trump. The law allows businesses to get loans to pay their employees and to cover certain other expenses, such as rent and utilities. The loans are forgiven if businesses meet specified terms. While the federal government created and administers the program, banks, credit unions and other lending institutions handle the loan applications and disbursement of funds. McSally’s campaign said Kelly criticized the program in an April 10 statement and a June 9 tweet. In his messages, Kelly directed his criticism at Congress — saying it should hold banks accountable for ensuring that small businesses can get aid. His criticism centered on how the program was being administered. ""I’ve heard over and over from small businesses across Arizona that the clock is ticking for them, and now it’s clear many of them are running into a wall of red tape blocking them from the aid they desperately need,"" Kelly’s statement said. ""Congress created this program and put much of the application process in the hands of big banks, and they have to provide accountability and make sure this money is getting to those small business owners and their employees who need it."" In an April 16 statement, not flagged by McSally’s campaign, Kelly said the program was running out of money, that only 10% of Arizona small businesses were approved for relief and that the Senate was adjourning without addressing the issue. ""Washington needs to get out of its own way, immediately put more resources into this program, and fix some of the issues that have made it harder for Arizona small businesses to get this relief,"" Kelly said. Big banks, Kelly said, had the power to choose which applications got priority ""and that’s not how this should work. This money should go where it’s needed most. Congress needs to get this done."" McSally on April 21 tweeted a similar grievance. ""Dear big banks: PPP is NOT your money. It is the taxpayers’ money intended to be a lifeline for small businesses & to keep them from going under due to coronavirus. We expected everyone in America, including you, to act with grace & speed to rescue those most hurt by this crisis."" In a follow-up tweet, McSally said she was troubled by reports of publicly traded companies with ""capital & bank relationships"" getting funds, ""while many ma & pa shops can't even get a call back or $1."" The next round of funds had to focus on small businesses, with better oversight and transparency, she said. McSally’s attack on Kelly refers to a loan received by a company Kelly co-founded. World View Enterprises, of Tucson, says it provides aerial data and analytics from sensors deployed to the stratosphere. Kelly’s stake in the company is valued at between $115,000 and $300,000, Kelly’s campaign told PolitiFact. But he left his role as strategic adviser in February 2019 and has never been a member of the company’s board of directors, said Jacob Peters, a spokesperson for Kelly. World View also told PolitiFact in a statement that Kelly was an investor but had no day-to-day involvement with the company. In late April, World View was approved for a loan to retain 38 employees. The loan was for an amount between $1 million and $2 million, according to Small Business Administration data. Kelly was not informed about World View’s loan application, ""nor was he involved in the decision process to decide to pursue a PPP loan,"" the company said. McSally’s campaign did not provide information to dispute the Kelly campaign’s explanation. PolitiFact did not find information showing Kelly was involved in the application process. McSally said Kelly, ""criticized the (Paycheck Protection Program), then turned around and took money for his own multi-million dollar company."" Kelly has criticized the way the program has been administered, but not the existence of the program itself. He’s argued that red tape is preventing small businesses from getting funds and that Congress needs to do more to help businesses get the funds and to hold banks accountable. A company that Kelly co-founded and in which he has investments received up to $2 million in a loan from the program. But Kelly’s campaign and the company say he was not involved in the application process. McSally’s campaign did not provide information disputing that statement and we didn’t find any either.

Trump’s false claim that children are ‘almost immune’ to COVID-19
","As millions of parents across the United States agonize over whether their children should return to school, President Donald Trump has continued to downplay the chances that children will catch COVID-19. ""This thing is going away, it will go away like things go away. My view is that schools should be open,"" Trump said on Fox and Friends Aug. 5.  ""If you look at children, children are almost, I would almost say definitely, but almost immune from this disease. So few. Hard to believe. I don’t know how you feel about it but they have much stronger immune systems than we do somehow for this. They don’t have a problem."" By the evening, both Facebook and Twitter took action against Trump for his statements about immunity and children which the social media companies said were violations of their policies against COVID-19 misinformation. Facebook took down a post of the Fox video clip on Trump’s official account, with a spokesperson saying it contained false information that violated its standards around harmful COVID-19 misinformation. Twitter, meanwhile, required a Team Trump campaign account to remove the tweet. It appeared that Trump had tweeted the video from his own Twitter account but the video link was dead. Trump is using the term ""immune"" to suggest that children won’t get sick. It’s clear that children do get infected, although symptoms are often not as serious as those for older adults. But he’s wrong to state that children are ""almost immune."" ""Children as a group are clearly less impacted by this virus than adults, but to say they are almost immune does not provide a truthful message,"" said University of South Florida public health professor Dr. Marissa J. Levine. The data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that children account for about 7.3% of cases. Children account for less than 1% of deaths.   But that data covers a time period when millions of children stayed home and did their classes online. That means we don’t yet know what will happen when children return to school buildings.  Although it is early in the school year, there have already been some students who tested positive including in Mississippi and Indiana. It’s unclear how many students will attend in person nationwide, although the majority of the largest school districts have chosen virtual learning.  Mark Schleiss, a University of Minnesota professor of pediatrics, said Trump is wrong on two counts: his statement about immunity and his suggestion that children are less likely to catch the germ than adults. ""Immunity means that your immune system has some sense of history with having encountered the germ before, and hence can fight it off,"" he said. ""Well, what's the biological plausibility that any person would have immunity to a virus that didn't even exist until a few months ago? And how could you have immunity to it if you never even encountered it before? So, as a pediatrician, immunologist and vaccine researcher, the statement is absurd, and unequivocally incorrect."" Schleiss pointed to a research letter published in The Journal of the American Medical Association by Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. Researchers examined 145 cases of mild to moderate COVID-19 illness and found children younger than 5 years have much higher levels of genetic material for the virus in their noses compared to older children and adults. Authors concluded that young children can potentially be important drivers of the virus spread, which causes concern for educators. Experts also pointed to the rapid spread of COVID-19 at an overnight camp in Georgia. Test results were available for 344 (58%) attendees; among these, 260 (76%) were positive. While children are in closer proximity to each other at overnight camp than a school, experts say it still serves as a warning about reopening schools.  ""That is not what we would expect of a group who were ‘almost immune,’"" Levine said. Andrew Noymer, an epidemiologist at University of California, Irvine, said Trump has a point in that children get sick at low rates, but his overall statement is misleading. The main fear about reopening schools is how it will spread to teachers and parents. ""The idea schools can open and everything is going to be hunky dory, sort of a summary of the president’s intended message, that is misleading,"" Noymer said. ""I am worried kids can catalyze the pandemic even worse than it already is in terms of an engine of generating infection of adults."" The White House pointed to statements by CDC director Robert Redfield in favor of reopening schools and his agency’s guidance on schools, but those statements didn’t address immunity. The White House also pointed to statements by Dr. Scott Atlas that ""children under 18 have virtually zero risk of death from this"" or serious illness. Atlas is a senior fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University and is the former chief of neuroradiology at Stanford University Medical Center. Studies about school children and COVID-19 are limited, but research from other countries indicates that high schoolers who come in contact with the disease respond more like adults, while elementary children present a lower risk of spread.  A recent study out of South Korea looked at more than 1,200 cases of people with COVID-19. It found that the rate of infection was three times higher for children 10 to 19 years old than for children under 10. After schools reopened in Israel in late May, outbreaks forced hundreds of schools to close, the New York Times found. ""Opening schools, especially for children above the age of 10, in crowded settings, can facilitate transmission,"" Hagai Levine, an epidemiology professor at Hebrew University-Hadassah told PolitiFact. ""Education is a must. So the lesson from Israel is to prepare and look for careful, gradual opening. If possible, learn outdoors."" In its guidelines for schools, the CDC said infection seems to vary by age, with students 10 to 17 being more likely to catch the disease than those under 10. Some European countries did have success in reopening schools, but most didn’t reopen school amid a spike of outbreaks like ones in some states in the U.S. Experts have warned that we can’t assume the U.S. experience this fall will mirror that of some other countries. ""We may learn much more about COVID-19 in children as schools open,"" Levine said. ""That is part of the unknown for which I would be hesitant to conclude with blanket statements about pediatric immunity to COVID-19."" Trump said ""children are almost immune from this disease."" The White House cited a statement by the CDC director in support of schools reopening and a doctor who noted that kids rarely get severe cases, but that doesn’t mean that children are immune to COVID-19. It’s wrong to state that children are ""almost immune"" as we have seen cases spread at an overnight camp in the U.S. and at some schools, including in Israel.

","North Carolina’s top health official says there’s evidence that a statewide mask requirement is helping stabilize coronavirus cases in the state. In a press conference on July 28, Health Secretary Mandy Cohen said: ""Our actions to slow the spread of this virus are having an impact. Specifically, we see a direct correlation to the start of the statewide mask requirement at the end of June. Two to three weeks after implementing this requirement, we started to see the beginning of these more stable trends."" Is it true that there’s a ""direct correlation"" between North Carolina’s mask requirement and COVID-19 stabilization? Data shows that the number of new reported COVID-19 cases is beginning to stabilize. Experts told PolitiFact the mask law and case count could be related, but that it’s hard to quantify the law’s impact. Gov. Roy Cooper announced the mask requirement on June 24 and it went into effect on June 26. Cohen said North Carolina’s case count started to level about three weeks later. Why is Cohen judging the rule’s effectiveness three weeks after its implementation, rather than immediately after its implementation? It can take up to 14 days between the time someone was infected and the time they start showing symptoms, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means someone could have contracted the virus before the mask mandate, but not shown symptoms or tested positive until after the mask requirement was in effect. So let’s look at North Carolina’s case counts. One way experts measure coronavirus trends is by calculating the 7-day rolling average for the number of new cases or deaths per day. The N.C. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and WRAL both track this metric. The average number of new cases per day rose until about July 18, when DHHS reported 2,481 cases. The daily count started to drop after that date, and the rolling 7-day average has been less than 2,000 cases ever since. So Cohen is right that the number of new cases is stabilizing. Is that a direct result of the mandate? There’s evidence that widespread mask-wearing has helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus, as we’ve previously reported.  We spoke with experts at the University of North Carolina, Harvard University, the University of Nebraska and the University of Toronto. While they agreed that there may be a correlation, they say there’s not enough evidence yet to determine how much influence the mask rule had on the stabilization. Other factors -- such as social distancing or testing availability -- could also play a role. But reviewing that data typically takes months, said Ryan McNamara, a research associate in UNC’s Department of Microbiology and Immunology.  ""There's just a lot of variables at play that need to be accounted for,"" he said. There’s a popular saying in research: ""correlation does not mean causation."" In this context, it means that the mask law may not have caused the dip in new COVID-19 cases, even though there are signs a cause-and-effect relationship could exist. ""That said, Dr. Cohen and her team are in possession of much more data than I am. I think her statement was carefully worded and has scientific merit."" Ali Khan, dean of the College of Public Health and professor of epidemiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, agreed that it’s premature to directly credit the mask rule for the leveling-off of cases.  But he believes Cohen’s claim is fair, given that ""other data that (shows) masks work and accounting for numerous caveats such as what else happened 2-3 weeks ago."" Dr. Barry Bloom, a research professor of public health at Harvard University, said it’s ""difficult to disaggregate a single intervention from the other standard public health behaviors."" However, Bloom said it’s possible that the mask requirement not only prompted more people to wear masks -- but to start taking other precautionary measures as well. ""I think it is safe to say they may have contributed to the more stable trends, assuming the trends are indeed stable for a couple of weeks,"" Bloom said.  As of August 3, the state’s rolling 7-day average remained below 2,000 cases and was still declining. Cohen said there’s a ""direct correlation"" between North Carolina’s mask requirement and COVID-19 stabilization. Based on the data available in late July, experts said there does appear to be a correlation, but it’s too early to draw conclusions about it. Verifying the strength of the correlation can take months. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C09CDC0>],/factchecks/2020/aug/05/mandy-cohen/there-correlation-between-north-carolinas-mask-law/

No evidence Israel hit Beirut with a nuclear missile
","More than 100 people were killed and thousands injured in a large explosion at the port of Beirut on Aug. 4. Lebanese officials have attributed the tragedy to the detonation of more than 2,700 tons of a chemical commonly used in fertilizer. But some have an alternative explanation for the explosion, which could be felt up to 150 miles away. ""Israel Hits Beirut with Nuclear Missile, Trump and Lebanese Govt. Confirm,"" reads the headline on an Aug. 5 article from Veterans Today, a website with a history of publishing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and Russian propaganda. The article itself has not been shared much on social media, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool owned by Facebook. But screenshots of the headline, images embedded in the story and similar claims have been shared widely across social media platforms. (Screenshots from Facebook) Some of the posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Lebanese officials are still investigating what sparked the fire that caused the explosion, which severely damaged buildings throughout the capital and covered the city in debris. But is there any evidence that Israel was involved? In a word: no. Initial investigation indicates no evidence the explosion in Beirut was caused by a nuclear weapon. Israeli officials have denied any involvement in the tragedy. The Lebanese government and President Donald Trump have not ""confirmed"" that Israel is to blame for the destruction. While it’s still unclear how exactly the explosion unfolded, available evidence points to a combination of fireworks and ammonium nitrate. Lebanese authorities have said the blast occurred at a warehouse along the Beirut waterfront. The explosion is thought to have been caused by the ignition of ammonium nitrate that had been stored at the site for six years, according to Prime Minister Hassan Diab. Ammonium nitrate is an explosive compound that’s commonly used in fertilizer and bombs. It was used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which left 168 people dead. Officials are still investigating what started the fire at the warehouse. However, the fire appears to have spread with the help of fireworks also stored at the port. Eyewitness video from Beirut shows what looks like fireworks igniting at the site of the fire at the port. The same footage does not show an incoming missile before the explosion. Stunning video shows explosions just minutes ago at Beirut port pic.twitter.com/ZjltF0VcTr A clearer view of the explosion also does not show any aircraft or missiles above the city. A more clear view of the explosion. #beirut pic.twitter.com/74NgZWvRL0 The explosion in the videos looks like a mushroom cloud. But contrary to the Veterans Today article, there is no evidence that the explosion was caused by a nuclear weapon.  Atomic explosions create a blinding light, searing heat and nuclear fallout — none of which have been detected in Beirut. Meanwhile, reddish smoke, a telltale sign of ignited ammonium, can be seen in several bystander videos. The Associated Press reported the blast appeared to create a ""condensation cloud, often common in massive explosions in humid conditions that can follow the shock waves of an explosion.""  Other fact-checkers have debunked claims that the blast was caused by a nuclear bomb.  So the explosion in Beirut was not caused by a nuclear weapon. But what about the alleged involvement of Israel? Israel is still technically at war with Hezbollah, a Lebanese political party that has been designated as a terrorist group by several countries — including the U.S. But Israeli intelligence officials have denied involvement in the Beirut explosion to several news outlets. In fact, Israel has offered humanitarian aid to Lebanon through the United Nations. ""On behalf of the government of Israel, I send my condolences to the people of Lebanon,"" tweeted the office of Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Aug. 5. ""Yesterday Lebanon suffered a major catastrophe. We are ready to offer humanitarian assistance, as human being to human beings."" The Lebanese government, which has accused Israel of provoking a recent escalation along the border, has not blamed its neighbor for the blast. Meanwhile, Trump said during an Aug. 4 press briefing that the Beirut explosion ""looks like a terrible attack."" When a reporter questioned his use of the word ""attack,"" the president doubled down. ""Well, it would seem like it, based on the explosion,"" Trump said. ""I've met with some of our great generals, and they just seem to feel that it was. This was not some kind of a manufacturing explosion-type of event."" But CNN reported that Trump’s comments contradicted the view of several Defense Department officials.  In its article, Veterans Today cites ""a general in the Lebanese Army,"" someone else who writes for the website (and another site linked to pro-Russian disinformation), and an image of what appears to be a bird near the fire at the port of Beirut. We reached out to the author of the Veterans Today article, but he did not comment. Veterans Today claimed Israel dropped a nuclear weapon on the port of Beirut on Aug. 4. There is no evidence to support that.  Lebanese officials believe a combination of fireworks and ammonium nitrate caused the explosion in Beirut, a hypothesis that experts and eyewitness videos back up. The characteristics of a nuclear blast have not been detected in the city. And Israel has denied any involvement in the explosion. The article is inaccurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B00A00>],/factchecks/2020/aug/05/blog-posting/no-evidence-israel-hit-beirut-nuclear-missile/

We reached out to Merkel, May and Grybauskaitė about the Facebook post but did not receive replies. However, we couldn’t find any corroborating evidence that the former British prime minister and the former president of Lithuania were photographed with her.  Rather, the available evidence points away from the Facebook post’s claim. It’s extremely unlikely that two public figures like May and Grybauskaitė would not also be identified in the photo alongside Merkel if, in fact, they were in the photo alongside Merkel.  We didn’t find any photos of Grybauskaitė as a teenager but photos of May around the time this photo was taken do not resemble the person pictured next to Merkel. The three women also did not attend the same schools or universities. Merkel attended high school in Templin, Germany, and then enrolled at what’s now known as the University of Leipzig in Germany. May was born in October 1956 and would have been 16 at the time the photo was taken. According to the BBC, she was mainly educated at Wheatley Park Comprehensive School in England before going to Oxford University.  Grybauskaitė was born in March 1956 and would have also been 16 at the time the photo was taken. She attended Vilnius Salomeja Neris Secondary School in Lithuania before studying at what was then known as Leningrad University in Russia.

Yes, at least five randomized controlled studies say hydroxychloroquine doesn’t help
","President Donald Trump and top health officials in his administration are now openly at odds over hydroxychloroquine. Both Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Deborah Birx, coronavirus response coordinator for the White House task force, have said careful studies show the drug doesn’t speed recovery from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Still, at an Aug. 3 White House event, Trump said he has taken hydroxychloroquine and it is ""very highly thought of.""  Trump said the drug is politically toxic because he supports it. On NBC’s Meet the Press, Adm. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary of health and overseer of the virus testing effort, said it is time to ""move on."" ""There have been five randomized controlled, placebo controlled trials that do not show any benefit to Hydroxychloroquine,"" Giroir said Aug. 2. ""So, at this point in time, we don't recommend that as a treatment. "" We asked Giroir’s office to name the five studies he referenced in that interview. Not all of them used placebos, but they all randomly assigned patients to hydroxychloroquine treatment and conventional treatment groups. The drug proved itself in none of them. Before we summarize the studies, a brief word about why this sort of study matters. If you want to know if a drug works, ideally the only difference between a patient who gets it and one who doesn’t is — no surprise — the drug itself. That’s harder to do than meets the eye. People aren’t identical. You can weigh them, look at their medical histories, check their blood oxygen levels and temperature, and yet, you still might miss something. That’s where randomly assigning patients to treatment and non-treatment groups comes in. ""You don’t know all the possible things going on in the background and all that noise is what  randomizing helps filter out,"" said Boston University infectious disease modeler Brooke Nichols. ""It’s the best way to be sure that the only effect is the effect of the drug."" Letting a computer program assign patients also prevents any subconscious choices by doctors from distorting the results. The whole approach is designed to take human foibles out of the picture. To really minimize the human factor, not only do you randomly assign patients to groups, but the patients and the health care workers themselves don’t know what group they are in. So everyone gets a pill, but for half of them, the pill might be just sugar or something equally neutral. That neutral pill is a placebo. ""That’s the gold-gold standard of research,"" said Nichols. ""And just one one small notch below that is the randomized controlled trial without a placebo."" Nichols said that the lack of a placebo takes on more importance when a non-placebo study comes up with different results than one with a placebo. ""When the results are in agreement, it doesn’t matter as much,"" Nichols said. Giroir’s office sent us a list of the studies he had in mind. All of them used the randomized control approach. Two of them used placebos, and three did not. They all found the drug ineffective. Here’s Giroir’s list (plus a couple more we found ourselves): A Cluster-Randomized Trial of Hydroxychloroquine as Prevention of Covid-19 Transmission and Disease, MedRxIV, July 26, 2020. No placebo. This study out of Spain aimed to see if the drug prevented the disease. It involved about 2,300 people who had been exposed to someone who tested positive for the virus. After random assignment, one group got a dose of hydroxychloroquine for a week, and the other didn’t. The differences were small, too small to be statistically significant. In the treatment group, 5.7% caught the virus. In the non-treatment group, 6.2% did.  ""Post-exposure therapy with hydroxychloroquine did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 disease and infection,"" the authors wrote. Hydroxychloroquine with or without Azithromycin in Mild-to-Moderate Covid-19, New England Journal of Medicine, July 23, 2020. No placebo. This study from Brazil assigned 665 patients (504 with testing-confirmed COVID-19) to three groups: standard care, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine alone.  ""Among patients hospitalized with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, the use of hydroxychloroquine, alone or with azithromycin, did not improve clinical status at 15 days as compared with standard care,"" the authors wrote. Hydroxychloroquine in Nonhospitalized Adults With Early COVID-19, Annals of Internal Medicine, July 16, 2020. Placebo used. This study of 491 patients in the United States and Canada used two groups: one receiving hydroxychloroquine and the other a placebo. Participants either tested positive, or had the symptoms of COVID-19 and lived or worked with someone who had tested positive. They could not have had symptoms for more than four days. ""We hypothesized that starting hydroxychloroquine therapy within the first few days of symptoms could alter the course of COVID-19 by reducing symptom severity and duration and preventing hospitalizations,"" the authors wrote. They found that the severity of symptoms after 14 days ""did not differ between the hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups.""  No clinical benefit from use of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, Recovery Trial - University of Oxford, June 5, 2020. No placebo. This study out of the United Kingdom randomly assigned over 4,600 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to a hydroxychloroquine treatment group and a standard care group. Researchers measured the death rate and symptoms after 28 days. Among the treatment group, 25.7% died, compared to 23.5% for the standard care group. That was not statistically different. And there were no ""beneficial effects on hospital stay duration or other outcomes."" ""Although it is disappointing that this treatment has been shown to be ineffective, it does allow us to focus care and research on more promising drugs.,"" the researchers wrote. The data has yet to be released. A Randomized Trial of Hydroxychloroquine as Postexposure Prophylaxis for Covid-19, New England Journal of Medicine, June 3, 2020. Placebo used. This study focused on hydroxychloroquine as a way to avoid getting the disease. They randomly assigned 821 people with no symptoms — but who had spent time close to a person who tested positive — to a treatment or placebo group. The hydroxychloroquine group was slightly less likely to test positive after two weeks, 11.8% compared to 14.3% in the placebo group, but the numbers were too small to pass statistical muster. We found two other randomized controlled studies in addition to those Grigoir referenced. One out of Spain worked with 293 people with confirmed infections, but who were not hospitalized. There was no placebo. They found that hydroxychloroquine did not cut the risk of hospitalization, or help people recover more quickly. An early study in May in Shanghai, China, assigned 75 COVID-19 patients to a hydroxychloroquine treatment group, and another received typical care. It also found no difference in the speed of recovery. There has been one large study in Detroit that concluded that the drug worked. However, patient data in that study was collected after the fact and there was no randomized control process. Giroir said there were five ""randomized controlled, placebo controlled trials that do not show any benefit to hydroxychloroquine."" He is largely correct. There have been more than five randomized controlled trials that found hydroxychloroquine ineffective, either at preventing people from catching the virus, or helping them recover if they become ill. He exaggerated the number of studies that used placebos — out of his list, two did and three did not. The infectious disease modeler we reached said placebos improve the quality of a study, but the lack of one matters less if the results are in line with placebo-driven trials. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C433E80>],/factchecks/2020/aug/05/brett-giroir/yes-least-five-randomized-controlled-studies-say-h/

Did Virginia lead the nation in reducing abortions? Not quite
","The Family Foundation, an influential voice for socially-conservative policies, recently predicted that an era of declining abortions in Virginia will be halted by new Democratic majorities in the General Assembly. ""Frankly, an uptick is unavoidable,"" the group said in a blog posted July 9 - shortly after laws went into effect repealing major abortion restrictions Republicans won in 2011 and 2012. The Foundation wrote, ""It wasn’t long ago (September 2019) that the Guttmacher Institute – a left-wing organization that advocates abortion– released a nationwide report revealing that Virginia, more than any other state, had the steepest drop in the number of abortions between 2011 and 2017."" Although Guttmacher Institute in New York is pro-abortion rights, it’s statistical research has been widely reported and cited as authoritative  by activists on both sides of the abortion debate. We wondered whether Guttmacher indeed found that Virginia had the biggest drop in abortion between 2011 and 2017. Guttmacher periodically publishes reports on the number of abortions performed in each state. The Foundation’s blog refers to Guttmacher’s latest report on states, released last September, that has data from 2014 to 2017. We accessed an earlier Guttmacher report to get statistics from 2011. The reports show the number of Virginia abortions from 2011 through 2017 fell from 27,110 to 17,210. That’s a 37% drop - twice the 18.5% national decline. But contrary to the Family Foundation, Virginia wasn’t No. 1 in reducing abortions. Delaware led the way with a 63% decrease, followed by Hawaii and West Virginia. In raw numbers, Virginia saw a 9,900 drop in abortions during the span. That was fifth highest, trailing the large states of California, New York, Texas and Florida. Guttmacher also compiles each state’s abortion rate - the number of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44. Virgina had 16.3 abortions per 1,000 women in 2011, and dropped to 9.5 per thousand in 2017. That’s a 42 percent decrease and it ranked third, behind Delaware and Hawaii. Although Guttmacher found that 32 states toughened their abortion laws bewteen 2011 and 2017, it questions whether those restrictions were the main force behind the national drop in abortions. Guttmacher says other factors may be more important, such as fewer pregnancies and greater access to contraception.   The Family Foundation, however, says the restrictions were the ""major factor"" in Virginia’s drop. It points to laws passed early last decade when Republican Bob McDonnell was governor, the GOP held two-thirds of the seats in the House, and the Senate had an anti-abortion majority of Republicans and a couple of Democrats. In 2011, Virginia enacted a law requiring abortion clinics to comply with hospital building codes - forcing centers to make expensive renovations or close. The number of Virginia clinics over the next six years dropped from 21 to 15.  In 2012, a new law required women to have an ultrasound at least 24 hours before an abortion and be offered a look at the image of the fetus. The law required many women to visit a clinic twice to get an abortion - some making lengthy trips. In November 2019, Democrats won majorities in the House and Senate for the first time in 24 years. Working with Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, they repealed both abortion restrictions. Our ruling The Family Foundation says ""Virginia, more than any other state, had the steepest drop in the number of abortions between 2011 and 2017."" It attributes its information to the Guttmacher Institute. According to Guttmacher, there were 27,110 abortions in Virginia in 2011, and 17,210 in 2017. That’s a huge 37 percent decrease - double the national average. But it wasn’t the largest drop among states. It ranked fourth. So we rate the Family Foundation’s statement Mostly True.

A few days before Lewis died, Obama tweeted that ""voting by mail shouldn’t be a partisan issue — especially during a pandemic.""

No, Joe Biden isn’t 'on board with defunding police'
","The funding of police forces across the country has made its way to center stage in the presidential race, after more than two months of protests over George Floyd’s death at the hands of officers in Minneapolis.  President Donald Trump’s campaign has started running an ad in Wisconsin that claims presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden is ""absolutely on board with defunding the police.""  The 30-second ad, posted to Youtube on July 20, 2020, shows an older woman, seemingly home alone, watching a news program that shows protests in Seattle and other cities. The voiceover claims that Seattle is planning to defund its police department by 50%, as well as remove some 9-1-1 dispatchers. Then, the voice of Sean Hannity of Fox News is heard:  ""Joe Biden is absolutely on board with defunding the police.""  Immediately following that, Biden’s voice can be heard saying: ""Yes. Absolutely.""  Trump has also made the same charge against Biden over and over again. A June 7, 2020 tweet on stated that Biden and Democrats want to defund police and another tweet made the same claim on July 17, 2020. He also repeated the claim during a July 19, 2020 interview with Chris Wallace on ""Fox News Sunday."" But repeating -- and repeating -- a falsehood does not make it true.  While some argue police departments should be eliminated entirely, as PolitiFact National detailed in a June 9, 2020 article, the use of the phrase ""defund the police"" more typically means to revisit the functions of police departments and shift funding toward, for instance, mental health and social services. So, where does Biden land? On June 9, 2020, he told ""CBS  Evening News"" host Norah O’Donnell that he supports ""conditioning federal aid to police, based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness.""  The following day, in an opinion piece that ran in USA TODAY, Biden said that abuse of power in police departments must stop and that reform is the answer to problems -- not defunding.  ""While I do not believe federal dollars should go to police departments violating people’s rights or turning to violence as the first resort, I do not support defunding police,"" he wrote. ""The better answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms, and to condition other federal dollars on completing those reforms.""  He then goes on to explain a $300 million plan to reinvigorate community policing in America, which would encourage relationship building between police officers and community members.  Biden’s campaign website says the $300 million would be used to set up grants that departments across the country could apply for to hire more officers. In order to get a grant, the departments would have to hire officers that reflect the racial diversity of the community they serve.  So, Trump flatly misrepresents Biden’s position. A Trump campaign ad running in Wisconsin claimed that Biden ""absolutely wants to defund police.""  But Biden himself has said several times in interviews and op-eds that he does not support defunding the police. And his campaign platform actually includes hiring more officers, focused on community policing.  We rate this claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A460480>],/factchecks/2020/aug/05/donald-trump/no-joe-biden-isnt-board-defunding-police/
