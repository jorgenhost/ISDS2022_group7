McClintock: Trump signed more bills in 100 days than any president since Truman
","California Republican Congressman Tom McClintock gave President Trump high marks for his initial performance in the White House, especially when it comes to the number of bills he’s signed into law. ""President Trump has passed more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Harry Truman,"" McClintock claimed in an interview on Sacramento’s KFBK radio station on April 28, 2017, one day before Trump’s 100th day in office. McClintock’s district includes the suburbs east of Sacramento and large stretches of the Sierra Nevada. The congressman’s claim echoed a statement by White House press secretary Sean Spicer just a few days earlier. ""Despite the historic obstruction by Senate Democrats, he's worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman, and these bills deliver on some of his most significant promises to the American people,"" Spicer said at the White House daily press briefing April 25. The national PolitiFact team has already examined Spicer’s claim. We’ll use their analysis to rate McClintock. Trump most productive? In a related fact-check in April 2017, PolitiFact rated as False Trump’s claim that no administration had accomplished as much as he did, period. It found Trump has had some achievements in office, but at the very least, they are much less numerous and far-reaching than those of President Roosevelt, the standard against whom all presidents are measured. In more recent years, other presidents, including Obama, have accomplished more in their first 100 days than Trump has, historians told PolitiFact. Looking at the number of bills, Trump had signed 28 as of late April 2017, just before his 100 day mark in office. Spicer and McClintock are correct that this is more than every president going back about 70 years. Trump signed 31 executive orders during his first 100 days, also more than any president since Truman, according to calculations in a CNN.com article. Many of those rolled back orders signed by President Obama. ""Those mean something to certain groups, but they don't have the kind of broad impact that legislation has, that programs that are approved by Congress have, because the fact that they can be rescinded by a stroke of a president's pen means they can be reimplemented with the stroke of another president’s pen,"" H.W. Brands, a professor of history at the University of Texas, who has written biographies of Woodrow Wilson, Andrew Jackson, and Benjamin Franklin, told Vox.com in a recent interview. ""Furthermore, they don't have legitimacy, the credibility, of having the approval of more than just one person. If you get major legislation passed, it has the approval of Congress and the presidency, and that means a whole lot more than if it's just the preference of a president."" Still, the bill signing measurement isn’t perfect either. That's primarily because not all bills are created equal. None of the bills Trump has signed into law are particularly significant or include any of his major campaign promises. The numbers Truman signed 55 bills in his first 100 days after his 1948 election. (Truman first became president in 1945, when Franklin D. Roosevelt died in office. So we’re starting with the first 100 days of Truman’s first full term.) No president since Truman has signed as many bills in his first 100 days, according to data from GovTrack and research by political scientists John Frendreis, Raymond Tatalovich and Jon Schaff. The next highest after Trump, who has signed 28 bills, was John F. Kennedy, who signed 26. The lowest was George W. Bush, who signed seven. No president comes close to Roosevelt, who began the tradition of marking the first 100 days. He signed 76. Note on the chart: For presidents Jimmy Carter through Trump, we did our own count using GovTrack. For earlier presidents, we used data confirmed by Frendreis, a political science professor at Loyola University Chicago. For Lyndon Johnson and Truman, who both came into office to replace a president midterm, we used the first 100 days after their re-election. We left out Gerald Ford because he did not serve a full term. Of the post-Truman presidents, Trump is ""fairly typical"" in terms of the number of bills signed so far, Frendreis said. The bills Spicer says that Trump has shepherded these bills through Congress. However, the 28 bills aren’t very significant and don’t appear to have required vote whipping from the White House. For example, three bills appoint individuals to the Smithsonian Institution board, two name buildings, and one designates a location for a National Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial. Trump worked directly with members of Congress to repeal Obamacare but failed to convince enough to end the federal healthcare law during his first 100 days. The most notable bills Trump has signed are a set of 13 that reverse Obama-era regulations on a range of issues including on internet privacy and gun control. While that was a goal for Republican lawmakers, it’s important to note these bills made it to Trump’s desk through a process made possible by the Congressional Review Act, which became law in 1996. The act gives Congress a narrow window to reverse regulations, so these 13 bills had to get through Congress within Trump’s first 100 days. Notably missing from the list of 28 bills that have reached his desk: A bill repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, along with several other laws Trump said he would usher through Congress within his first 100 days. Compare this to President Barack Obama, who signed 14 laws, but those laws included the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and the $800 billion stimulus package. Or Roosevelt, who within 100 days signed 15 major bills including the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which established farm subsidies, and the National Industrial Recovery Act, which started public-works efforts to reverse the Great Depression. He signed bills that legalized the manufacture and sale of beer and wine and established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority. Generally speaking, it’s rare for a president to sign major legislation in his first 100 days, Frendreis said. ""Outsider"" presidents like Trump, in particular, need time to learn how to navigate the lawmaking process in Washington, and major legislation doesn’t move through Congress quickly. The first 100 days is ""not necessarily an accurate reflection of how effective a president is going to be in leading Congress,"" he said. Our ruling White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump has ""worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman."" California Republican Congressman Tom McClintock made a similar claim about Trump passing more legislation than any president since Truman. In the first 100 days of his first full term, Truman signed 55 bills. The president with the highest count since then is Trump with 28. The national PoltiFact rated Spicer’s claim Mostly True, with the key clarification that none of the bills Trump has signed so far are major pieces of legislation. They added that his accomplishment doesn’t indicate that Trump has been particularly skilled at getting his agenda through Congress so far. For the same reasons, and with the same key clarification, we rate McClintock’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Does the GOP's new health care bill still cover pre-existing conditions, as Trump claims?
","President Donald Trump remains hopeful that he can deliver on his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a plan from the Republican Party. In an interview with CBS’ Face the Nation, Trump argued that the GOP’s health care plan covers pre-existing conditions, despite what news reports have said. ""Pre-existing conditions are in the bill,"" Trump said April 30. ""And I just watched another network than yours, and they were saying, ‘Pre-existing is not covered.’ Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it. I said, ‘Has to be.’ "" Trump was more than likely referring to the most recent version of the GOP health care overhaul, an amendment by U.S. Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., introduced in late April. ""This bill is much different than it was a little while ago, okay? This bill has evolved,"" Trump said. ""But we have now pre-existing conditions in the bill. We've set up a pool for the pre-existing conditions so that the premiums can be allowed to fall."" When CBS’ John Dickerson pressed Trump on whether everyone with pre-existing conditions would be covered, Trump said, ""We actually have a clause that guarantees."" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said at the May 1 news briefing that Trump was referring to the MacArthur amendment and that Trump is ensuring that ""coverage of pre-existing conditions is at the core"" of the legislation. But the reality of how the bill addresses pre-existing conditions -- which are health problems patients have before new insurance kicks in -- is much more complicated than Trump makes it sound. What the amendment says on pre-existing conditions In March, the Republican’s American Health Care Act died without a vote when Republicans couldn’t agree on the bill designed to replace the Affordable Care Act. Under the new bill, called ACHA, insurers had to cover pre-existing conditions, but they could have charged more for people who are recently uninsured. The MacArthur amendment would allow states to obtain waivers to some requirements of the Affordable Care Act, including the ""essential health benefits"" provision that requires maternity care or mental health services. The amendment has language that appears to protect those with pre-existing conditions stating that ""nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting insurers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions."" But experts say other parts of the amendment suggest that those with pre-existing conditions could struggle to maintain affordable health insurance. The amendment permits insurers to set premiums based on the ""health status"" of an individual by looking at their current and past health status and make predictions about how much an individual will use medical care in the future, said Linda Blumberg, senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute. That’s where pre-existing conditions could come into play, because it would mean that the costs rise for consumers who are sicker, said Timothy Jost, Washington and Lee University School of Law emeritus professor. ""Health status underwriting is literally charging a higher (possibly much, unaffordably, higher) premium to people with pre-existing conditions,"" Jost said. ""Under the MacArthur amendment, they could not be refused coverage, but insurers could impose high enough premiums that coverage would be unaffordable."" The amendment says that the waiver would allow states to set up a high-risk pool or participate in a new federal invisible risk-sharing program to help states reimburse insurers for covering high-risk consumers.   ""No state may obtain a waiver for health status unless it has taken these efforts to protect those who might be affected,"" stated a MacArthur press release. ""In states with a waiver, individuals who maintain continuous coverage could not be rated based on health status."" That means people who stay insured without any lapses can’t be charged more by insurance companies if they get sick. But experts said that many low-income people aren’t able to stay covered without breaks,  and that questions remain about the effectiveness of the high-risk pools. The American Medical Association, which opposes the amendment, said in a statement that it ""could make coverage unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions."" The AMA raised questions about whether the high-risk pool would be ""sufficient to provide for affordable health insurance or prevent discrimination against individuals with certain high-cost medical conditions."" Our ruling Trump said of the GOP health care amendment, ""Pre-existing conditions are in the bill."" The amendment says that health insurers can’t limit access to coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, but that insurers can charge people more if states agree. In some states, health insurers would be able to charge sicker people more. And experts warn that high-risk pools -- the mechanisms meant to keep premiums lower for sick people -- might not be effective. Overall, the latest proposal seems to weaken existing protections for people with pre-existing conditions, not strengthen them.

Donald Trump says he's the only modern president to fill SCOTUS seat in 100 days
","President Donald Trump told National Rifle Association members that 100 days in, he’s already fulfilled a major promise he made to them on the campaign trail: nominating a conservative justice to the Supreme Court to replace Antonin Scalia. In fact, he said he’s the first president since 1881 to fill a Supreme Court vacancy in his first 100 days. ""I kept my promise, and now with your help, our brand new justice — and he is really something very special — Neil Gorsuch sits on the bench of the United States Supreme Court,"" Trump said at the group’s annual meeting April 28. ""For the first time in the modern political era, we have confirmed a new justice in the first 100 days. The last time that happened was 136 years ago, in 1881. Now, we won't get any credit for this, but don't worry about it."" Trump has his history right. He is indeed the first modern president to fill an open Supreme Court seat within the first 100 days. The last president to do so was Chester A. Arthur, who took office Sept. 19, 1881, and nominated Horace Gray to the bench the following December. But this isn’t as big of an achievement as it might seem. The reality is that very few presidents are presented with the opportunity to appoint and confirm a new Supreme Court justice within their first 100 days. Other than Trump, just four presidents since 1900 have had that chance: Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Harry Truman and Warren Harding. And Trump is the only one of the group who entered office with a vacant Supreme Court seat from the start — meaning he had a full 100 days to nominate and confirm his pick. For both Harding in 1921 and Truman in 1945, the Supreme Court seat opened up about 11 weeks into their respective presidencies. For Clinton, it opened up about eight weeks in. (One hundred days is about 14 weeks.) None of them nominated and confirmed a replacement until after the 100 days were up. Chief Justice Earl Warren announced his retirement in 1968, before Nixon took office the following January. But Warren said he would stay on the bench until his replacement was confirmed, so there was no actual vacancy. Nixon didn’t get a replacement confirmed until June 1969. For a good overview of Supreme Court nomination timelines going back to 1900, see this report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Our ruling Trump said, ""For the first time in the modern political era, we have confirmed a new justice in the first 100 days."" Before Trump, the last time a president nominated and confirmed a Supreme Court nominee within his first 100 days was Arthur in 1881. However, Trump’s statement leaves out the important fact that it’s rare for a president to have the opportunity to nominate a justice in those first 100 days. Trump and Nixon are the only presidents since 1900 to have entered office knowing they have a seat to fill imminently. Three others learned of an opening near the end of the 100-day benchmark. Trump’s statement is accurate but needs additional context. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/apr/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hes-only-modern-president-fill-s/

Would Trump’s border wall cost the same as one and a half U.S. aircraft carriers?
","The debate over President Trump’s proposed border wall intensified this week, with opponents saying the barrier would be ineffective and a costly mistake. Building ""a big, beautiful wall"" on the Southern border was Trump’s signature promise during his campaign, winning him support from advocates for hard-line immigration reform. But when Trump initially demanded funding for the wall be included in a stop-gap budget measure needed to avoid a government shutdown, opponents in Congress balked. Rep. Scott Peters, D-San Diego, said the billions needed to build the wall should be used elsewhere. Peters went on to make an eye-opening claim about what money for the wall could fund instead: ""We’ve checked in with The Navy; if we don’t pass the 2017 budget, they’re talking here about five ships that won’t be available to sail just out of the Western region — and 15 worldwide...the money for the wall? That’s, by the way, (the cost of) one and a half aircraft carriers,"" Peters was quoted as saying on April 24, 2017 in a Politico news article. We know cost estimates for the wall are high. But would the price really equate to ""one and a half aircraft carriers""? We set sail on a fact check. Paying for a ""big, beautiful wall"" The U.S. border with Mexico is nearly 2,000 miles long. It already includes about 650 miles of fencing constructed under previous administrations. Trump has said the wall doesn’t need to span the entire border, adding in a television interview that ""We don’t need 2,000 (miles), we need 1,000 because we have natural barriers."" During his campaign, Trump initially said he could build a wall for $4 billion and later estimated $6 billion to $7 billion. In April 2017, he put it at $10 billion or less. The Associated Press reported in March that the Trump Administration wants to build a 30-foot-high border wall that ""looks good from the north side and is difficult to climb or cut through,"" according to a pair of contract notices posted to a government website.  A drone's view of the US-Mexico border fence as seen from Nogales, Mexico, Sunday, April 2, 2017. (Brian Skoloff / AP) Cost estimates for the wall vary greatly. Here are some relevant estimates, as chronicled by news publication Quartz. In July 2016, Bernstein Research, a firm that analyzes material costs, put the price tag at $15 billion to $25 billion, for a wall that stretches 1,000 miles and is 40 feet high, which was Trump’s initial desired height. In January 2017, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the wall would be $12 billion to $15 billion. In February 2017, a leaked report from the Department of Homeland Security put it much higher, at $21.6 billion. In April 2017, the Democratic staff of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee said in a report that costs could soar to nearly $70 billion — not including the significant costs and legal resources required for land acquisition. Peters’ spokesman Jacob Peters said the congressman used the $21.6 billion estimate because it ""comes from the internal report done by the Department of Homeland Security."" ""This estimate falls somewhere in the middle of the range of cost estimates,"" the spokesman added. ""Because this report was commissioned by (Department of Homeland Security) Secretary Kelly, and is based on the Trump administration’s own planning process to build walls and fences to cover almost the entirety of the border that is not already fenced, it is the best current estimate for what President Trump is likely to ask Congress to appropriate to build his border wall."" We also used the $21.6 billion as our estimate. Aircraft carrier cost Finding the cost of the latest U.S. aircraft carrier is a bit easier. Peters’ spokesman pointed to a Congressional Research Service report from April 2017 that places the cost of each new ""Navy Ford Class Aircraft Carrier"" at approximately $12.9 billion. That’s up from the $8.5 billion cost of carriers in the Navy’s most-recent Nimitz class, according to a Navy fact sheet. The first carrier in the new class, the USS Gerald R. Ford, is expected to be commissioned later in 2017. It’s been described as ""the most expensive and most advanced warship ever built."" Still, when we do the math, it appears Peters slightly underestimated his comparison: Building a $21.6 billion border wall would cost about 1.67 times the price of these new warships. We asked Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego to examine the cost figures. Reaser told us the number ""does appear to check out."" Our ruling Democratic Congressman Scott Peters recently claimed the estimated price of President Trump’s border wall is the same as the cost of ""one and a half aircraft carriers."" Peters used a $21.6 billion estimate, citing a leaked report from the Trump Administration’s Department of Homeland Security. That figure is within the $15 billion to $25 billion range produced by a private research firm. Peters referenced the $12.9 billion price tag on the Navy’s newest class of aircraft carriers from a Congressional Research Service report. At this early stage, no one knows how much Trump’s wall will really cost. Partisan sources have it all over the map. And delays and cost-overruns are common for large government projects: Just take a look at California’s massive high-speed rail initiative. But Peters selected what appears to be the best initial estimate from Trump’s own homeland security analysts. If anything, Peters slightly underestimates the 1.67 aircraft carriers the U.S. could build for the cost of Trump’s border wall. We rate Congressman Peters' claim True.

Nancy Pelosi on target about what Donald Trump might save under his tax plan
","House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., took aim at President Donald Trump’s tax proposal by making it personal -- how much the president would stand to gain from passage of his own tax proposal. ""The ‘tax plan’ rolled out by @realDonaldTrump would have cut his taxes by $30 million in 2005 (the only year we have returns for),"" Pelosi tweeted. The ""tax plan"" rolled out by @realDonaldTrump would have cut his taxes by $30 million in 2005 (the only year we have returns for) Is this accurate? To the extent we know anything about Trump’s personal tax situation, experts said she is basically correct. What we know about Trump’s taxes Trump is the first presidential candidate, and the first president, in decades not to release his tax returns. Two portions of Trump’s tax returns have been leaked to the media. One consists of summary pages from state tax returns from 1995, which were sent anonymously to the New York Times last fall. However, because these are state -- not federal -- tax documents, they don’t shed much light on Pelosi’s claim. The second forms are the summary pages from his 2005 federal tax return, which were first reported in March by MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. The 2005 returns suggest that Pelosi is in the ballpark, judging by the alternative minimum tax alone. Trump’s tax plan would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, which is a calculation that guarantees that certain higher-income taxpayers with large deductions pay at least a minimum amount of tax. A line in Trump’s 2005 tax return shows that Trump paid $31,261,179 that year for the AMT. That was a large portion of his total tax bill: Had it not been for the AMT, Trump would have owed only about $5.3 million in federal taxes that year. Some room for questions When we contacted Pelosi’s office, a spokesman provided two analyses. One, by Pelosi’s own staff, cited the AMT line from his 2005 report. The other analysis, published by the Democratic staff of the House Ways and Means Committee on April 26, said that Trump would save about $28.6 million mostly through the reduction of the ""pass-through income"" rate to 15 percent. (""Pass-through income"" involves a certain type of structuring for business and personal income taxes.) Given these two projections, ""we decided to go with an average of $30 million,"" said Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill. Several tax experts said that $30 million is a reasonable estimate, given what we know. ""In round numbers, Pelosi's assertion is correct,"" said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. Several experts added, however, that the combination of Trump’s lack of transparency about his own taxes and the lack of detail he’s offered so far in his tax proposal provide a lot of room for uncertainty. For instance, in future years, Trump’s taxes may be more reliant on the lower, 15 percent tax on pass-through income than the AMT, said Daniel Shaviro, a New York University law professor whose specialties include taxation. But we don’t know exactly how that would change the equation. ""We don't really have enough detail from Trump's tax returns to properly analyze the impact of reforms,"" said Gary McGill, director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida. ""And even the reform plan is not so much a plan but a high level of general objectives."" Then again, if Trump wants to complain about an incorrect estimate of his tax burden, all he has to do is release his tax returns, Shaviro said. Our ruling Pelosi said, ""The ‘tax plan’ rolled out by @realDonaldTrump would have cut his taxes by $30 million in 2005 (the only year we have returns for)."" Experts agree that $30 million is a reasonable estimate, given the limited information available, both in Trump’s public tax returns and the bullet-point nature of his tax-policy proposal. Still, it is an estimate, so the actual number may be quite a bit lower or higher.

Republican senator from Arizona cites growth in U.S.-Mexico trade after NAFTA
","President Donald Trump has been consistent in criticizing NAFTA -- the North American Free Trade Agreement -- as being a bad deal for America. But not everyone in his own party agrees. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., has delivered a series of strong statements in support of the trade pact between the United States, Mexico and Canada. In a speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate, Flake said NAFTA’s economic benefits can’t be ignored, adding that in 2016 Arizona’s trade with Mexico exceeded $15 billion. ""Trade deals like NAFTA make inputs for U.S. manufacturing cheaper than they would otherwise be,"" Flake said April 27. ""Cheaper inputs mean lower production costs for U.S.-based businesses, which in turn allows these companies to expand production and reduce prices."" And while NAFTA could be modernized, it has helped both the United States and Mexico, Flake said. Flake shared similar thoughts on Twitter: ""Before NAFTA, trade between the US and Mexico was around $50 billion. Now it stands at more than $500 billion. What's not to like?"" Before NAFTA, trade between the US and Mexico was around $50 billion. Now it stands at more than $500 billion. What's not to like? We wondered if Flake’s numbers were correct and how much of that growth can be attributed to NAFTA, as his message suggested. We found that his data is largely accurate, but experts say NAFTA does not deserve all of the credit for the trade increase. Trade before and after NAFTA Trump consistently has criticized NAFTA, saying that the United States has not been treated fairly by trade partners Canada and Mexico. He has promised to renegotiate the agreement to better suit the United States. NAFTA initially was negotiated by Republican President George H.W. Bush, who agreed to the trade pact in December 1992 about a month before leaving office. It was then up to Democratic President Bill Clinton to round up support and get it passed through Congress. Clinton signed the bill implementing NAFTA in December 1993. NAFTA went into effect Jan. 1, 1994. Flake’s statement that trade between Mexico and the United States was around $50 billion before NAFTA stems from Census data, his press office said. We found that in 1993, the year before NAFTA became effective, there was a trade flow of about $81.5 billion in goods with Mexico (exports $41.6 billion, imports $39.9 billion). That’s a little higher than Flake said. Flake’s office said that he looked at data around 1988-1989, ""using a general time frame"" before and after NAFTA to make the comparison. In 1988, trade between the United States and Mexico totaled about $43.9 billion. In 1989, it was $52.1 billion. The other figure in the Arizona senator’s claim said trade between the two nations now stands at more than $500 billion. That checks out. In 2016, trade was about $525 billion (exports $231 billion, imports $294 billion). NAFTA’s impact Flake hinted that growth in trade was linked to NAFTA. His office did not respond to requests to elaborate on this point. Economists and trade experts told us that while NAFTA can be attributed for some of the increase, there are other factors at play, such as inflation and GDP growth. And there is a lot of debate on NAFTA’s overall economic impact and on the number of jobs that as a result of it have been lost or created. Most of the increase in trade volume between Mexico and the United States is due to NAFTA, said Gerardo Esquivel Hernandez, an economist and professor at El Colegio de Mexico. But part of the dollar increase is also explained by increases in prices and economic activity in both the United States and Mexico, he said. NAFTA facilitated U.S.-Mexico trade growth by lowering tariffs, creating a framework to protect foreign investment, and essentially locking in a series of market-oriented reforms that Mexico made in the 1980s and early 1990s, said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center. ""For nearly 25 years, NAFTA has been the foundation upon which massive trade growth has occurred,"" Wilson said. But other factors have also contributed, he said. ""The most important are geography and growth of the U.S. and Mexican economies,"" Wilson said. ""Unless significant policy barriers prevent it, the most natural thing is for trade to grow between neighboring countries that are each experiencing GDP growth."" The trade balance is also worth highlighting as it ""has a much more direct impact on the economy than the total volume of trade,"" said Robert Scott, a senior economist and director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. Scott said that for about a decade before NAFTA, the United States had a ""roughly balanced"" trade with Mexico. But it has turned into a deficit after NAFTA, reaching $63.2 billion in 2016. Our ruling Flake tweeted, ""Before NAFTA, trade between the US and Mexico was around $50 billion. Now it stands at more than $500 billion."" Flake is close on the numbers. NAFTA went into effect in 1994. The year before that, trade between the United States and Mexico was about $81.5 billion, according to Census figures. Flake’s office said he looked at other years, 1988 and 1989, in which trade was closer to $50 billion. Data for 2016 show about $525 billion in trade between the two countries. Economists and trade experts told us that NAFTA has played an important role in trade growth, but several other factors must also be taken into consideration.

Do tax cuts pay for themselves? Evidence is thin
","The Trump administration unveiled a one-page list of tax reform principles inspired by the theory that tax cuts can unleash enough economic growth to cover lost revenue. President George H.W. Bush famously derided this as ""voodoo economics,"" and present-day critics are no less dismissive of what they see as magical thinking by the White House. ""The Trump administration will say, 'Well, hey, tax cuts are going to create growth, growth is going to create revenue, that's going to offset all this deficit,'"" Rana Foroohar, a CNN economic analyst and Financial Times columnist, told CNN April 26. ""Well, there's no real evidence in the last 20 years that that has happened."" We decided to investigate this claim. First, the big changes under the White House proposal: the business tax rate drops from 35 to 15 percent for both big and small corporations alike, personal income tax brackets go from seven brackets to three (10, 25, and 35 percent), and the so-called standard deduction -- the amount of personal income not subject to federal income tax -- will be doubled, while some other deductions are removed. There’s isn’t much more detail than that, making it difficult to put a price tag on the proposal. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, or CRFB, attempted to analyze the one-pager’s potential effect on the debt, making a lot of assumptions along the way. Their best guess, which was quickly eaten up by Trump’s critics on TV, was an increase to the debt of $5.5 trillion, or somewhere between $3 trillion to $7 trillion.    There’s other ways to offset tax cuts than economic growth: you can raise rates on other taxes, like through a tax on imports, as House Republicans want. Or you can limit tax breaks, cut spending, or do some combination of these, and it’s certainly possible the Trump administration will explore these options. A White House fact sheet by chief economic advisor Gary Cohn on April 26 did make a passing reference to nixing some tax breaks for the wealthy. But the administration has offered no specifics on paying for the cuts, and as of April 20 Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin was still insisting, ""The deal will pay for itself."" So let’s set aside for now the other ways the administration may seek to offset lost revenue from tax cuts. For Trump’s tax cuts to pay for themselves, the economy would have to grow by $5.5 trillion, or roughly a sustained 4.5 percent, for the next 10 years, according to CRFB. That’s a mark that any president is unlikely to hit. Trump promised during the campaign to have 4 percent growth per year. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has since said the target is 3 percent growth. In reality, the average annual growth rate since 2001 has been 1.8 percent, according to Vox. Most experts we interviewed concurred with Foroohar that the idea that tax cuts could spur the level of growth needed is not realistic. One economist went further than Foroohar, noting that steep tax cuts may actually impede economic growth. Several experts cautioned that isolating tax cuts as the sole cause of whatever economic conditions are to follow is more than a little tricky, since good or bad economic conditions can coincide with tax cuts and affect federal revenue. Another caveat is that tax cuts can be manipulated to look as if they’re boosting growth when they’re really not -- as we’ve shown before. While tax cuts don’t pay for themselves fully, tax cuts can generate some growth. For instance, take a 2005 study by the Congressional Budget Office that asked what would happen if Americans got a 10 percent income tax cut. Under CBO’s most optimistic projection, nearly one-third of the tax cut would be offset by additional tax revenue over 10 years. (We’ll get to their pessimistic projection soon.) N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard University economist and former chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush, shared a similar view. ""A reasonable rule of thumb, in my judgment, is that about one-third of the cost of tax cuts is recouped via faster economic growth,"" Mankiw said. Edward Kleinbard, a professor of law and business at the University of Southern California, said smart corporate tax reform could stimulate the economy somewhat -- but at a net loss. ""A really well-designed corporate tax reform package, including a rate cut, would be accretive to growth,"" he said, ""but not enough to pay for any resulting large-scale deficits."" So tax cuts can create some growth, according to the experts. But are there any historical cases of tax cuts producing so much growth they fully pay for themselves? ""I am not aware of any credible evidence (in the U.S.) over the last several decades of a broad-based tax cut paying for itself,"" said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. ""I don't think this is at all controversial among actual economists."" Kleinbard was similarly emphatic: ""There is no time in modern history where tax cuts could be said to pay for themselves."" According to Kleinbard, the 1981 tax cuts triggered massive federal deficits and were largely reversed within three years. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was basically revenue neutral, he said, meaning tax cuts were virtually offset by spending cuts. He added that President Bill Clinton’s tax hike was followed by robust growth, while the George W. Bush tax cuts led to anemic growth. None of the experts interviewed cited evidence that tax cuts under President Barack Obama produced sufficient growth to pay for themselves either. On the contrary, there’s some evidence that tax cuts can be a drag on the economy -- like the 2005 CBO study mentioned earlier. When the CBO studied the effects of a hypothetical 10 percent income tax cut for Americans, not all the projections were as rosy as the finding above. Under the CBO’s most pessimistic projection, tax cuts would lead to a 3 percent increase in lost revenue over 10 years. Indeed, tax cuts can have a number of adverse effects that may actually impede growth, according to Kleinbard. One example is a phenomenon known as the ""crowding out"" effect. The basic idea is that tax cuts create deficits that cause the government to borrow more money and therefore enter deeper debt, which can make private sector borrowing more expensive. Our ruling Foroohar said, ""There's no real evidence in the last 20 years that"" growth from tax cuts has made up lost revenue. We searched high and low and found no economic experts who could point us to evidence of tax cuts fully paying for themselves. Neither the modern historical record (using fair benchmarks) nor government analyses we looked at supported the claim that tax cuts create enough growth to eventually offset lost revenue. On the contrary, there’s evidence that tax cuts may actually hinder economic growth.  We rate Foroohar’s statement True.",/factchecks/2017/apr/28/rana-foroohar/trumps-tax-plan-prompts-question-can-tax-cuts-real/

Reports that Trump offered asylum to Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses use fake quotes
","Fake Internet posts said President Donald Trump offered to give refuge to Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses after that country banned followers of the religion, but there is no record he made any such comments. ""Trump warns Russia over Jehovah’s Witnesses ban and urges members to seek asylum in the U.S.,"" reads the headline on an undated story on States-TV.com. The post first appeared on or around April 24, 2017, on States-TV.com, HoustonChronicle-TV.com and Fox-News24.com. Facebook users flagged it as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to clear fake news from users’ news feeds. The post is keyed to a real event: Russia’s Supreme Court banned the religious organization on April 20, labeling the group as a danger for ""extremist activities."" The assets of the St. Petersburg headquarters and almost 400 chapters were designated state property. Its literature and website have also been banned. From there, the story devolved into fairytale, claiming Trump warned that the move ""is contrary to the constitution of the land of the Russian Federation."" ""I request you to reverse the decision immediately before I use your own constitution against you,"" Trump is quoted. He also is credited as saying Jehovah’s Witness could find freedom in this country. ""As this is an infringement of your fundamental human right, I therefore urge you to seek asylum in the United States until your rights are fully reinstated,"" he said, according to the post. The problem is, there is no record Trump said any of these things. Aside from a few examples of this same post being on multiple websites, we couldn’t find any official record of him personally addressing the subject at all. We reached out to a White House spokesman to confirm this but didn’t receive a response. State Department spokesman Mark Toner did release a statement on April 20 saying that the United States was ""extremely concerned by the Russian government's actions targeting and repressing members of religious minorities, including Jehovah's Witnesses, under the pretense of combating extremism."" Toner also noted that religious freedom was critical to society. ""All religious minorities should be able to enjoy freedom of religion and assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the Russian Federation's constitution,"" he said. But there’s no mention of Trump making any statement, and we couldn’t find one elsewhere. Reposts have circulated of the country’s 175,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses being harassed by Russian police since the ruling. Fox-News24.com is a url that attempts to mimic Fox News, but has no connection to the cable news network. The same goes for HoustonChronicle-TV.com, which mimics the real newspaper’s name but doesn’t look to have affiliation. All three of the sites are filled with the same kind of sponsored content ads endemic to fake news sites. But even though this story appears to be bogus, it’s difficult to fully determine the point of the websites, because they do contain some legitimate news articles. Fox-News24.com, for example, features one article about Education Secretary Betsy DeVos saying she wouldn’t mind shutting down the Education Department. It’s copied practically word-for-word from a Feb. 17 story from U.S. News & World Report. Fox-News24.com administrators have hidden the registration of the website, which was only registered on March 20. There is no contact information available. The same goes for the other two websites we’ve noted. The story said that Trump warned Russia for banning Jehovah’s Witnesses, and offered a safe haven for Russians who wanted to come to America.

Diversity in Congress: Democrats have women and minorities, Republicans have white men over 55?
","Shortly after Donald Trump was elected president and again after his inauguration, it was reported that the 115th Congress, which was seated in January 2017, is the most racially diverse in history. So we wondered if U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan was correct when he painted a different picture in Metro Weekly, a Washington, D.C. publication that serves the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning) community. Asked in the April 7, 2017 article whether ""underrepresented groups, either minorities or women or LGBTQ people,"" will get more politically active, Pocan said he hoped so. The Wisconsin Democrat also recited a quote he attributed to the late Ann Richards, a Democrat who was the governor of Texas before George W. Bush: ""If you don’t have a seat at the table, you’re likely on the menu."" And then he said: When you look at the floor of Congress, it’s especially telling. On the Democratic side of the room, you’ve got men and women of all different races. On the other side, you’ve got a bunch of white men in dark suits, all over 55 or so. It’s such a contrast. That’s not representative of the country. We really need to get people making sure that everyone has a voice. What we found is Pocan is largely on target, in that Democrats are more diverse, although there are more than older white men among Republicans. Gender diversity We’ll tackle Pocan’s claim in three parts. We base our analysis primarily on a March 2017 report on the current makeup of the House and Senate by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, which provides policy and legal analysis for Congress. Taking into account vacancies and independents, it lists 289 Republicans and 239 Democrats among the 535 voting members of the two chambers. The first part of Pocan’s claim is about women. The report shows that Democrats, even though they are outnumbered by Republicans, have three times more women in the two chambers. Democratic women Republican women 78 26 Racial diversity The contrast is even greater for racial diversity. Democrats have nearly six times more minority members than the Republicans. Minority* Democrats Republicans African-American 48 3 Hispanic/Latino 30 13 Asian/Indian/Pacific Islander 16 0 Total 94 16 The 94 Democrats who are minorities comprise 39 percent of all Democrats in Congress. That’s as representative as the 38 percent of the U.S. population that is nonwhite Hispanic and other racial minorities. The 16 minority Republicans represent only 5.5 percent of all GOP members. White men over 55 The Congressional Research Service report does not provide a breakdown to check the third part of Pocan’s claim -- that Republicans in Congress are dominated by white men over age 55. But LegiStorm, a company that researches Congress, provides a close approximation. Its data shows that two-thirds of the Republican members of Congress (compared to about 40 percent of Democrats) are white males age 50 and over. Two parting notes from analyses done by the nonprofit Pew Research Center, which show women and minorities making gains in Congress as a whole: Gender: The share of women in Congress has reached an all-time high: Women now hold 104 seats, or 19 percent. Race: Congress remains disproportionately white when compared with the U.S. population, but is becoming more representative: Minorities account for 20 of 59 (34 percent) of the new members elected in November 2016. Our rating Pocan said: In Congress, ""on the Democratic side of the room, you’ve got men and women of all different races; on the other side, you’ve got a bunch of white men in dark suits, all over 55 or so."" Democrats have several times more women and several times more minorities than Republicans do in the House and Senate combined. And older white males are much more predominant among Republicans. At the same time, fully one-third of GOP members are not while males over 50. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/apr/28/mark-pocan/congress-democrats-have-women-and-minorities-repub/

Fake news story about Trump banning Facebook by executive order is an April Fool’s Day prank
","A fake Internet post said President Donald Trump was going to outlaw Facebook, but a closer look revealed it was a simple April Fool’s Day prank. The headline on an April 2, 2017, post on usanews4u.us declared, ""Donald Trump to issue an executive order to ban Facebook across U.S."" Likely concerned by the prospect, Facebook users flagged it as potentially being fabricated as part of the social media site’s efforts to stamp out fake news. The fake post said that Trump was going to take action despite criticism from congressional Republicans, because fake news was still being widely circulated on the site. Facebook users, federal judges and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg were all prepared to fight any executive order, but Trump didn’t care. ""Inside, we both know what’s been going on. We know the game and we’re gonna play it,"" Trump is quoted in the story. First and foremost, we know that this is a faker than fake quote, because it’s a line from Rick Astley’s Never Gonna Give You Up. Internet-savvy users should realize instantly they’re being Rick Rolled here. That’s apparently still a thing for some people. But we just gotta tell you how we’re feeling, and gotta make you understand.

We tried to reach usanews4u.us through their Contact Us form, but didn’t receive a reply. The site is registered to an address in Veles, Macedonia, a hotbed of fake news websites.

Did trade deficit cause slow growth in 2016, as Donald Trump tweeted?
","In an early-morning tweet, President Donald Trump took a not-so-veiled shot at his predecessor’s economic record. ""The U.S. recorded its slowest economic growth in five years (2016). GDP up only 1.6%. Trade deficits hurt the economy very badly,"" Trump tweeted on April 26, 2017: The U.S. recorded its slowest economic growth in five years (2016). GDP up only 1.6%. Trade deficits hurt the economy very badly. We’ll look at the gross domestic product number first, then look at whether there is any linkage between a large trade deficit and weak economic growth. Slow GDP growth To check the growth in gross domestic product, we turned to the official data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Specifically, we looked at the year-over-year increase in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product. According to the final revision released on March 30, inflation-adjusted GDP increased by 1.6 percent between 2015 and 2016. How does that compare to previous years? As Trump said in his tweet, it is the lowest annual increase since the change between 2010 and 2011, when the year-to-year increase was also 1.6 percent. Here’s the annual change in GDP going back to 2000: We should note, as we typically do with statements like this, that no president deserves full credit or blame for economic performance on their watch, because no president is powerful enough to singlehandedly shape the economy. Other forces, from technological advances to developments overseas, can have significant effects. Also, reasonable people can disagree about how good or bad 1.6 percent annual growth is. An advanced industrialized nation like the United States is not going to see high annual growth rates typical of developing countries. When the GDP numbers were announced in January, Beata Caranci, chief economist at TD Economics, told the Washington Post, ""I know most people say ‘Oh, 2 percent isn’t that great,’ but in the current world it is. Many countries would be envious."" What impact from the trade deficit? Contrary to the implication of Trump’s tweet, there is little direct relationship between a big trade deficit and weak GDP growth, at least for the situation the United States is in now. Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, took issue with Trump’s implication, saying that a trade deficit is mainly a reflection of underlying patterns of savings and consumption in the economy. For instance, she said, following a tax cut, the economy may be stimulated and the dollar will often become stronger relative to other currencies. That makes U.S. imports more expensive and imports cheaper. So Americans with newly flush wallets would tend to purchase more imports and fewer domestic goods than they ordinarily would, thus increasing the trade deficit. If the economy is operating below capacity -- generally defined as high unemployment -- then policies to reduce the trade deficit would tend to increase domestic production and employment, helping the economy, said I. M. 'Mac' Destler, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland and author of the book, American Trade Politics. But if the United States is not in a below-capacity situation -- and it is not currently -- ""then reducing the trade deficit, with increased demand for U.S. production, would lead to overheating the economy, inflation, and not much improvement in net welfare for Americans,"" Destler said. We will also note that Trump’s linkage between a high trade deficit and low GDP growth is undercut by recent data. The reality is that the United States’ trade deficit has been substantial for years, through periods of both faster and slower GDP growth. Here’s a chart showing the size of the annual trade deficit going back to 2000, the same period covered by the chart of GDP growth above. If anything, pairing the two charts shows that two of the years with a relatively small trade deficit -- 2001 and 2009 -- were two of the three weakest years for GDP growth during that time span. ""The United States has had persistent trade deficits since the early 1980s,"" de Bolle said. ""Between then and now, we've had recessions, and episodes of higher growth, all of them accompanied by trade/current account deficits. There is absolutely nothing to suggest that trade deficits led to weak GDP growth in 2016, based on historical data."" Our ruling Trump said, ""The U.S. recorded its slowest economic growth in five years (2016). GDP up only 1.6%. Trade deficits hurt the economy very badly."" Trump is right that GDP growth was slower in 2016 than in any year since 2011. But there’s little evidence to suggest that growth was sluggish in 2016 because of the trade deficit. A sizable trade deficit has been a fact of life for at least two decades, including years of both faster and slower economic growth. If anything, two recent years of smaller trade deficits actually coincided with weak economic growth.

Has Trump ‘given more financial disclosure than anybody else?'
","Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin says President Donald Trump ""has no intention"" of releasing his tax returns to the public, arguing that Americans have more than enough information about the president's financial matters. During an April 26 press conference to outline Trump's tax plan, a reporter asked Mnuchin if Trump will release his tax returns. ""The president has no intention,"" Mnuchin replied. ""The president has released plenty of information and, I think, has given more financial disclosure than anybody else. I think the American population has plenty of information."" We’ve heard claims like this before. But as we concluded in the past, Trump’s lack of tax returns undermine any type of claim that he’s released more financial information than anybody else. What do we know about Trump’s finances? When we asked the Treasury Department about Mnuchin’s comments, staff told us that his remark was specifically in reference to Trump’s 92-page financial disclosure form. That financial disclosure form is formally known as the Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Report. The personal financial disclosure form must by law be made public. Trump’s disclosure form is extensive and includes 92 pages of small-print details on assets and income. Treasury spokesman Tony Sayegh said Mnuchin claim was grounded in the fact that Mitt Romney’s form was only 47 pages, not counting amendments and updates. Sayegh argued that even Romney, a businessman with a complex set of holdings, didn't release as much in his financial disclosure. But extensive or not, the financial disclosure form is not a substitute for tax returns. And given the fact Mnuchin remark was made after a question about tax returns, it’s possible that his comment would be interpreted more broadly to include all the types of financial disclosure, not just the form. When Trump argued that his financial disclosures were ""the most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics,"" we rated that claim False. The two most obvious pieces of the puzzle missing without Trump’s tax returns are the effective rate of tax he pays on his income, and the extent and nature of his charitable giving. Tax returns also can give a clearer picture of Trump’s liquid assets and what specific mix of taxes the candidate paid. The returns would also show if Trump has access to specialized tax breaks. ""It is true that Trump's businesses have received a lot of attention, but without the release of Trump's tax returns, we don't know a lot about his personal financial situation,"" Lawrence White, an economist at New York University’s Stern School of Business, told PolitiFact in October. Trump was the first major presidential nominee in 40 years not to release his tax returns, citing a routine audit. In 1976, President Gerald Ford, did not release his tax returns but instead provided a summary of his taxes. His opponent, Jimmy Carter, did release his tax returns that year — and every major-party nominee since Carter has released them to the public, until Trump. Tax Analysts, a publisher specializing in tax policy, has been collecting publicly available tax returns of presidential candidates and other top officials for its Tax History Project. This archive goes back as far as the 1913 tax returns of future president Franklin D. Roosevelt. Former president Barack Obama released tax returns for 16 years (2000-15.) George W. Bush and Bill Clinton released tax returns for every year in office except for their last. George Bush released three years of returns, and Reagan released 6 years worth of returns. Before the election, Trump promised he would release his returns after a routine audit was over. However, there is no law that prohibits someone from releasing tax returns during an audit. (Richard Nixon released tax returns in the middle of an audit a year after being re-elected.) On April 17, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump's audit was still ongoing, but Mnuchin remarks suggest it might not happen at all. Without his tax returns, it’s hard to know how Trump would personally benefit from his tax cut proposals. Trump’s proposal recommends sharp cuts in individual and business income tax rates, as well as eliminating the estate tax and alternative minimum tax. Additional context about Trump, tax returns and the public Although Trump has refused to release his tax returns, some of them have leaked out. Most recently, Rachel Maddow of MSNBC revealed a small portion of Trump's 2005 tax return. It showed that he earned $150 million that year and paid federal taxes of about $38 million. In 1995, Trump reported a $916 million loss, according to the three pages of returns obtained and verified by the New York Times in September. We know a little bit about Trump’s taxes in the 1970s. A 1981 report by New Jersey gambling regulators analyzed Trump's finances as part of his efforts to get a casino license for a proposed casino-hotel complex. Page 33 reports on Trump's income and federal tax payments for 1975 through 1979. The report says that Trump paid federal taxes for three of those five years, 1975-77. Trump did not pay federal income tax in 1978 and 1979 because, according to the tax rules, he lost money those years. But the report reveals no specifics, so the details of his tax returns for those years remain a mystery. Trump’s taxes have piqued the interests of voters for quite some time now. In January, Trump said that Americans don’t care about his tax returns, but several polls of the time show that a sizable portion of the public does think Trump’s tax returns are an important issue. Our ruling  Mnuchin said Trump ""has given more financial disclosure than anybody else."" Trump released a financial disclosure report that all presidential candidates are required to fill out, but the fact that Trump has not released any tax filings undermines Munchin’s claim. Experts told us that tax returns would offer valuable details on his tax rate, the types of taxes he paid, and his charitable giving, as well as a better idea of his income-producing assets. When we look at all the types of financial disclosure Trump could provide to the public, the lack of transparency around his tax returns remains a significant omission compared with recent presidents.

"['Education', 'Florida', 'Bob Cortes']","
Are all Florida charter schools not-for-profit?
","Florida lawmakers who support the expansion of charter schools have adopted a single talking point to explain how the schools are managed. Rep. Bob Cortes, R-Altamonte Springs, faced a series of questions from Rep. David Richardson, D-Miami Beach, after introducing HB 7101, one of several measures under consideration in the legislative session that would increase access to charter schools. Like public schools, charter schools receive state funds. The key difference is they are privately managed. Richardson was curious about the bill’s provision that specifies that a charter school operator may use assets of their charter school for K-12 educational purposes in ""other schools."" ""These other schools, would they also have to be a not-for-profit or could they be a for-profit?"" Richardson asked. Cortes said, ""They would have to be a school within their own network. So part of the charter school system itself."" ""So does that mean the other schools would have to be a 501(c)(3)?"" Richardson asked. ""All charter schools are not-for-profit,"" Cortes said. Cortes’ bill passed in the House by an 81-39 vote. The same argument resurfaced in debate of ""schools of hope"" legislation that would create a $200 million fund to lure charter schools to under-performing districts. Rep. Manny Diaz Jr., R-Hialeah, said, ""Under Florida state statute, a charter school is a non-profit organization, so there is no such thing in Florida as a for-profit charter school."" The statements jumped out to us because there have been problems with charter schools being used to benefit people privately. Florida law technically requires charter schools to be nonprofits. But the system is largely run by for-profit companies, which Cortes' statement leaves out. Not-for-profit, or not? The charter-school solution was originally touted as a way to give families — particular those in low-income areas — another option for schooling. Critics say too many taxpayer dollars have been shifted to the private companies that run charter schools to the detriment of traditional public schools. So, are all charter schools in Florida not-for-profit? Technically speaking, a not-for-profit is a type of organization that does not earn profits for its owners.  Cortes cited a provision of a Florida statute (1002.33 sec 12(i)) as evidence of this claim, which mandates that a charter must organize as, or be operated by, a nonprofit organization. The Florida Department of Education echoed Cortes’ evidence. Audrey Walden, the agency’s press secretary, said the defining document that sets the academic, financial and organizational performance benchmarks for a charter school is determined by the local school district and the nonprofit charter school board. The charter governing board can choose to enter into contracts with private entities to provide services and support. ""But, ultimately, performance and accountability rests with the nonprofit governing board -- which, when it enters into a charter agreement with its local school district, is subject to the same Sunshine Laws and School Accountability System that pertains to all public schools in Florida,"" she said. More to the story Not all charter schools operate in the same way. And sometimes nonprofit charter governing boards enter into contract with for-profit companies. The management company does not manage the governing board, but rather it handles certain aspects of the operations of the school under a contract with the governing board.  The Miami Herald’s examination of South Florida’s charter school industry found several instances of for-profit management companies controlling charter schools’ day-to-day operations.   The Herald found examples of charter schools relinquishing total control of their staff and finances to for-profit management companies. In Miami-Dade County, the Life Skills Center paid 97 percent of its income to cover fees incurred by a management company. Then, the governing board of two affiliated schools tried to ""eject"" the management company’s managers. As a result, the management company withheld money from the school and threatened to press charges against people within the school from trying to get it back. The Herald also found that some owners of the management companies also control the land and buildings used by the charter school. Owners of Academica Corp., the state’s largest charter school management company based in South Miami, collected almost $19 million a year in lease payments on school properties. In other cases, it found that the school’s nonprofit board were full of people with ties to the for-profit management companies.  This trend continues across the nation. ProPublica reported that several charter schools around the country funneled all of their revenue to a for-profit company hired for day-to-day operations including schools in New York and Ohio. A spokesman for the state's largest teachers union, the Florida Education Association, sent us a report that summarized the agency’s arguments against ""schools of hope"" legislation. The FEA isn’t completely against charter schools, but its website says, ""While some charters adhere to the original idea, and have shown some success, many charters have become for-profit drivers for large corporations bent on taking over our public schools."" Our ruling Cortes said that all charter schools are not-for-profit. A Florida provision requires charter schools to be operated or controlled by a nonprofit organization. This technical talking point omits that many nonprofit charter school boards enter in to contracts with for-profit companies. Some for-profit charter school management companies have drawn increasing scrutiny over the years for how they’ve controlled the school’s money. This statement leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2017/apr/27/bob-cortes/are-all-florida-charter-schools-not-profit/

So when you say that suddenly I've got a monthly deficit that's higher than the annual deficit left by Republicans, that's factually just not true, and you know it's not true. And what is true is that we came in already with a $1.3 trillion deficit before I had passed any law. What is true is, we came in with $8 trillion worth of debt over the next decade."" We checked Hensarling's claim in a separate item. Here, we'll look at Obama's claim that he came into office with a $1.3 trillion deficit and $8 trillion worth of debt over the next decade. On Jan. 7, 2009, two weeks before Obama took office, the Congressional Budget Office reported that the deficit for fiscal year 2009 was projected to be $1.2 trillion. The 10-year projection was estimated to be about $3.1 trillion. So Obama's number was very close on the 2009 deficit -- he said $1.3 trillion -- but substantially different from the 10-year projection -- he said $8 trillion. There are two reasons why he differs from the CBO. On the difference between the $1.2 trillion and the $1.3 trillion, the Obama administration credited a small portion of spending on its watch to policies of the previous administration. The reason for this is that the federal government runs on a fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, so Bush and Obama technically split responsibility for 2009 spending. The large difference on the 10-year projection has to do with Bush administration tax cuts. The CBO creates its estimates based on current law, which means the CBO assumes that the Bush tax cuts will end in 2010 and everyone will start paying higher taxes in 2011 and going forward. The Obama administration, on the other hand, assumed in its baseline that those tax cuts would be renewed. Economists we spoke with -- Josh Gordon, policy director for the Concord Coalition, and Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst of the conservative Heritage Foundation -- both said they believe the White House approach is more realistic because it assumes current policy will continue. So the CBO's estimate is $5 trillion lower than the White House numbers, though economists don't quibble with the White House methodology. It does highlight, however, that when it comes to budget projections, people can have differences of opinion about what to include. In any budget projection there is room for interpretation, but it seems reasonable to assume for a baseline that the Bush tax cuts will continue. Obama's numbers are fairly solid, so we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jan/29/barack-obama/obama-inherited-deficits-bush-administration/

Price says Obama and his aides have said Republicans have 'no ideas' on health care
","During an exchange with President Barack Obama at a Republican retreat in Baltimore, Rep.

""You have repeatedly said, most recently at -- at the State of the Union, that Republicans have offered no ideas and no solutions,"" Price said on Jan. 29, 2010. ""I don't think I said that,"" Obama replied. ""What I said was within the context of health care -- I remember that speech pretty well. It was only two days ago. . . . I said I'd welcome ideas that you might provide. I didn't say that you haven't provided ideas. I said I'd welcome those ideas that you'll provide.""Price then said, ""Mr. President, multiple times from your administration there have come statements that Republicans have no ideas and no solutions, in spite of the fact that we've offered, as demonstrated today, positive solutions to all of the challenges we face, including energy and the economy and health care."" Because Price appeared to correct himself after Obama's reply, we decided to focus on the second claim, that people in Obama's administration have made ""statements that Republicans have no ideas and no solutions."" Price spokesman Brendan Buck provided a couple of examples and we found a couple of our own: • At a picnic with labor officials in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Sept. 7, 2009, Obama complained that the critics of health care reform -- he didn't identify them as Republicans, but it was clear he was referring to them -- were not offering their own solutions. He said, ""I've got a question for all those folks: What are you going to do? What's your answer? What's your solution? And you know what? They don't have one. Their answer is to do nothing. Their answer is to do nothing."" • A White House blog post attacking the Republican health care plan said it offered ""no ideas."" (The posting appears to have a typo. It reads: ""The Republican bill offers new no ideas."") • White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel on April 19, 2009, described the Republicans as ""the party of never . . . the party of no new ideas."" (He was referring not just to health care, but also to fiscal discipline.) • At a White House briefing April 28, 2009, press secretary Robert Gibbs made a similar comment: ""I think you heard me and others say that you can't just be the party of no or the party of no new ideas."" The White House doesn't dispute that aides have portrayed Republicans that way, but a spokeswoman said the Democratic health care plan includes many amendments that were proposed by Republicans. Still, Price is right. Obama and his aides have said the Republicans have no ideas on health care and other issues.

"['Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Florida Gov. Crist says he has suspended 37 public officials
","Some of Florida's public officials have been bad boys and girls, Gov. Charlie Crist says. ""You know, I have had the challenge during this administration to suspend no less than 37 public officials in about 36 months,"" Crist told reporters gathered in Tallahassee on Jan. 27, 2010. ""It's pretty stunning, and it's pretty disappointing."" The Florida Constitution enables Crist, as governor, to suspend any elected public official indicted for a crime and remove public officials from office who are convicted. The governor also can suspend state or county officials -- anyone from people appointed to state or local boards or even public notaries -- for misconduct. Is Crist really on a suspension-a-month pace? We asked the governor's office for a list of people suspended by the governor since he took office in January 2007. Officials provided a seven-page document listing 38 names and titles of people they say the governor has suspended or removed from public office. Each entry includes a corresponding charge and points to an executive order codifying the action. (You can read the governor's document for yourself.) The list includes some familiar names: *No. 28 -- James ""Bob"" Richburg, the former Northwest Florida State College president. Richburg was suspended from the board of directors of Workforce Florida in April 2009 after being indicted in the case involving former House Speaker Ray Sansom. Sansom has been accused of falsely securing $6 million in taxpayer money to construct a college building that would double as an aircraft hangar for a friend and major Republican donor. * No. 35 -- Scott Rothstein. Rothstein was suspended from a judicial nominating committee after agreeing to be permanently disbarred. A major political fundraiser, Rothstein pleaded guilty on Jan. 27, 2010, to five counts of racketeering, fraud and money laundering as part of a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme. * No. 34 and No. 38 -- Miami City Commissioner Michelle Spence-Jones. Spence-Jones was suspended by Crist in November 2009 after being arrested on charges that she redirected $50,000 in county funds to a now-defunct family business. She won her seat back in a special election in January 2010. She was immediately suspended again. The list also includes people probably unfamiliar to most, including eight notary publics. The notary publics, who are considered state officers under Florida law, were suspended in most cases for notarizing signatures and documents improperly. Examining the full list, we found some problems: * Beverly Gallagher, a member of the Broward County School Board, is listed wrongly both as No. 30 and 32. Her entries point to two different executive orders -- one that removes her from office, and one that removes someone else. Gallagher and Broward County Commissioner Josephus Eggelletion (No. 31 on the governor's list) were arrested in September on federal corruption charges, accused of taking bribes. * Gregory Burke is both No. 7 and No. 25. Burke, a commissioner of the South Walton County Mosquito Control District, was first suspended from office Dec. 13, 2007, then removed by Crist on Dec. 24, 2008 -- hence the two separate entries. * Two officials -- Miami City Commissioner Johnny Lee Winton and Hollywood City Commissioner Kenneth Wasserstrom -- were removed from office by Crist but actually suspended by Gov. Jeb Bush. * Another official, Miramar City Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman, appears on the list twice. The first entry was from March 2007, when he was reinstated into office by Crist (he had been suspended by Bush). Salesman was then suspended by Crist in December 2007 after being arrested. * No. 20, Johnny Green, was suspended from the Cross City water board after being charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bribery, according to the governor's office. Green's entry appears to note that the suspension was dissolved by Executive Order 08-235, but that order actually acknowledges a judicial vacancy in the 17th Judicial Circuit. The governor's list also includes one person who has returned to office and appears to overlook another person the governor suspended in 2008. John Scanlon, a commissioner with the Fort Myers Beach Fire Control District, was suspended after drug charges, but reinstated after completion of a pretrial diversion program. And James Roy Paul, superintendent of the Escambia County School District, was suspended from office by the governor in June 2008 after being charged with driving under the influence. But he was not on the governor's list. Where does all of that bring us in the accounting? First, we excluded the double reference to Gallagher and the entry reinstating Salesman. That drops us to 36. We then added Paul, who was not on the governor's list. Back to 37. We then double-checked that everyone on that list had been in fact suspended. We relied on the governor's online repository of executive orders, and when that didn't help, news accounts. When both options failed, as it did in one case, we asked the governor's office for the executive order directly. Then there was the case of three officials (Winton, Wasserstrom, Burke) whom Crist removed from office. You can make an argument that reduces the number of suspensions to 34. Crist told reporters he has had to ""suspend no less than 37 public officials"" since taking office in 2007. He's just about right on. The number actually includes people Crist removed from office, a more severe punishment than suspension. And the final number includes the suspensions of eight public notaries -- not what most people think of when they hear ""public official."" Crist gets points off for both, and from PolitiFact, a rating of Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jan/29/charlie-crist/florida-gov-crist-says-he-has-suspended-37-public-/

National Democrats say Gov. Perry has watched over many uninsured, highest home insurance rates and skyrocketing college tuition
","It’s no surprise when Democrats criticize the Republican governor of Texas.For instance, Democratic National Committee spokesman Ricardo Ramirez reacted to Gov. Rick Perry’s recent criticism of President Obama by saying Perry had himself to blame for problems in Texas. Ramirez elaborated in a Jan. 20 press release: “Under (Perry’s) watch as governor, over 6 million Texans have no health care coverage, including 1 million children, homeowners suffer from the highest insurance rates in the country and college tuition has skyrocketed 136 percent from 2003 to 2008.”Did Ramirez's punches hit home? We revisited his left-right, left-right combination.Ramirez and Stephanie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, each pointed us to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of U.S. Census data suggesting that in 2008, 6,023,000 Texans lacked health insurance—placing the state second only to California, which had more than 6.7 million residents lacking coverage.More than 1.4 million Texas children were uninsured in 2008, the foundation estimates. The state had the most uninsured children in the nation that year; California ran second with more than 1.1 million uninsured children.The Democratic spokesman didn’t forward evidence for his next jab, that Texans pay the nation’s highest home insurance rates.Jerry Hagins, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Insurance, said homeowners' insurance costs more in Texas because the state is exposed to severe weather in the form of hurricanes and tornadoes and hail. “Texas is high (in its rates) and will always be high,” Hagins said. “We don’t want to sugar-coat that.”Indeed, the state's rates often top those of other states, as compiled by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. In its latest report, based on 2007 data, the rates for Texas were second only to those in Florida.  In general, home insurance rates historically run highest in Texas, Florida and Louisiana because they’re big states with vast coastal exposures, said Michael Barry, spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, a New York group funded by the insurance industry. “Homeowner insurance prices in these states reflect the risks of losses there,” Barry said.Barry suggested Texas may rise to No. 1 in the next annual compilation of rates when the data from 2008 -- the year Hurricane Ike slammed Texas -- is absorbed. One wrinkle: The NAIC and Texas insurance department caution against comparing the Texas statistics to those from other states--partly because fewer Texas homeowners carry the comprehensive coverage highlighted in the compilation and partly because calculations for some states, such as Florida and Louisiana, don't take into account the rates paid on policies from state-guided providers of last resort. Those providers offer insurance coverage when it's not available from private insurers.By its own calculations — which differ from the national report — the Texas department found that homeowners here don't necessarily fare worse than residents of some other states. The average annual Texas premium in 2007 was $1,251--less than the $1,401 average premium in Louisiana and $1,560 in Florida (though the Florida average excludes policies written by the state's insurer of last resort). What about Ramirez’s last punch, on college tuition?Ramirez cited a state overview stating that tuition set by public college and university boards increased 136 percent on average from fall 2003 to fall 2008.But the same analysis states that total tuition, meaning board-set tuition levels added to baseline amounts set by lawmakers, increased 69 percent on average. Separately, the Austin American-Statesman’s Ralph K.M. Haurwitz, who covers higher education, has tapped state figures to conclude that average tuition and mandatory fees — every student faces such fees — at the state’s public universities climbed 86 percent, to $6,300 a year, by fall 2008.All in all, the Democratic spokesman landed his health-insurance blows. But he slipped when he claimed Texas currently has the nation's highest home insurance rates and overshot on changes in tuition.We rate Ramirez’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jan/29/democratic-national-committee/national-democrats-say-gov-perry-has-watched-over-/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Pundits', 'Nancy Pfotenhauer']","
Health care reform does not increase premiums and boot people out of their coverage
","In an interesting display of chutzpah from a television pundit, Republican strategist Nancy Pfotenhauer claimed on CNN that she understood perfectly the president's health care proposals, then proceeded to distort them.

""You've got an extremely talented man here who's a great orator,"" she said after President Barack Obama's State of the Union address. ""I don't think anybody could challenge that. But if there's a sin, it's hubris, and at one point, when he was talking about health care, he literally said, you know, hey, you're not with me, but that's okay. I understand. I just didn't speak clearly enough to you. Like if I slow down and talk in smaller words, maybe you'll get it."" ""And so the response is, no, no, you explained it, I heard it and I disagreed with you,"" she added. ""You're talking about a proposal that increases taxes by half a trillion dollars, that cuts Medicare by half a trillion dollars, that causes most Americans to have their premiums increased, not decreased, and hundreds of millions of people to lose their current insurance coverage. This is not something that's good."" (That didn't get challenged by host Larry King, who then went to a commercial.)

Pfotenhauer boiled down some complicated issues we've been reporting on for quite a while into a zinger of a soundbite. A bit of what she said was true, but most of this is a significant distortion of Obama's reforms. Here, we're going to rule on the most dramatic part of her claim, that the plans cause ""most Americans to have their premiums increased, not decreased, and hundreds of millions of people lose their current insurance coverage."" We contacted Pfotenhauer, who served as an adviser to Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign, and asked what the basis of her claims were. But we didn't hear back.

We've written before about the Democratic proposals to increase taxes to pay for expanded health care coverage. The House bill increases income taxes on the wealthy, and the Senate bill has an excise tax for high-cost health care plans, or ""Cadillac"" plans. Add up those taxes, plus other revenue provisions in the form of fees, and those revenues do approach $500 billion over 10 years. On Medicare spending, both bills seek to curb spending on Medicare by trimming excess payments to private insurers under the Medicare Advantage program, as well as other freezes on payments intended to reduce waste. (Check out this comparison on the details on Medicare created by the independent Kaiser Family Foundation. You'll find details on Medicare changes on Page 14.) Those provisions too approach $500 billion over 10 years. But the measure also includes more funding for Medicare's prescription drug plan.

Then Pfotenhauer said most Americans would ""have their premiums increased, not decreased,"" and that ""hundreds of millions of people lose their current insurance coverage.""

On Nov. 30, 2009, the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, released a detailed analysis on how health insurance premiums might be affected by the Senate Democrats' health care bill. The CBO is an independent agency whose estimates for pending legislation are considered nonpartisan and rigorous.

The CBO reported that, for most people, premiums would stay about the same, or slightly decrease. This was especially true for people who get their insurance through work. (Health policy wonks call these the large group and small group markets.) People who have to go out and buy insurance on their own (the individual market) would see rates increase by 10 to 13 percent. But more than half of those people -- 57 percent, in fact -- would be eligible for subsidies to help them pay for the insurance. People who get subsidies would see their premiums drop by more than half, according to the CBO. So most people would see their premiums stay the same or potentially drop.

As for ""hundreds of millions of people"" losing their coverage, there is little evidence to support this. Republicans have been making the claim based on a study by the Lewin Group, which stated that 123 million people would choose a public option for health insurance if it were cheaper than their current coverage. (The Lewin Group is respected by many health care analysts and operates with editorial independence, but it is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, whose primary business is private health insurance.)

There were other problems with how Republicans have used the Lewin study to claim that people would be pushed out of their coverage, and you can read more about those problems in another item we reported back in October. But it's not necessary to go into those details because the Senate has since rejected a public option.

So it's not clear where Pfotenhauer is getting her numbers now. Certainly there will be some churn among plans, just as there is now, when companies change insurance plans. (For this reason, we gave Obama a Half True for saying that people could keep their current coverage. Under the plan, employers would still be able to choose new plans.)

But the CBO has found that the numbers of uninsured will be lower under the Democratic plans. The Senate Democrats plan would increase the percentage of the insured from 83 percent to 94 percent. So we don't see how millions of people would lose their current coverage.

It's true that there is a lot of confusion among the public about the health care proposals. The independent Kaiser Family Foundation recently conducted a poll and found that ""even after a year of substantial media coverage of the health reform debate, many Americans remain unfamiliar with key elements of the major bills passed by the House and Senate."" The poll also found tremendous differences based on political affiliations: Democrats supported the proposals, Republicans opposed them, and independents were roughly split.

In Pfotenhauer's appearance on CNN, though, she said she understood the proposals but disagreed with them. Then she said -- and this was not phrased as an opinion -- that the plans will cause ""most Americans to have their premiums increased, not decreased, and hundreds of millions of people to lose their current insurance coverage."" There's not an independent, nonpartisan analysis out there on the current Democratic proposals that shows that. These are Republican talking points that have repeatedly been proven false, but they keep coming back. Pfotenhauer's statement is not just false, it's ridiculously so.

Boehner claims Obama's proposed spending freeze will only reduce government spending ""by little more than one-half of 1 percent""
","In his State of the Union address on Jan. 27, 2010, President Barack Obama unveiled a proposal to freeze discretionary spending for three years to help dig the country out of a ""massive fiscal hole."" But Obama included some caveats. He said the freeze would exclude spending on national security as well as entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. And the freeze won't take effect until next year, ""when the economy is stronger,"" he said.""Understand,"" Obama said, ""if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery -– all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes.""That kind of belt-tightening talk makes for good sound bites, Republican leaders said afterward, but the freeze described by Obama, while a small step in the right direction, amounts to a tiny sliver of the country's massive (and growing) debt.""President Obama's proposed 'spending freeze' will only reduce the $42 trillion in government spending proposed between 2011 and 2020 by little more than one-half of 1 percent,"" House Republican Leader John Boehner wrote in a live blog during Obama's speech.But first, are Boehner's numbers themselves accurate?A report released this week from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the federal government will spend $42.9 trillion over the next 10 years. The Obama administration itself says the freeze on nondefense discretionary spending would save $250 billion over 10 years. That number, however, is a bit more speculative than the CBO's overall estimate.Speaking before the Senate Budget Committee on Jan. 28, 2010, Douglas W. Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said his office did not have enough details from the White House about which categories of spending would be exempt from Obama's pledge. Those details will be revealed when the White House presents its proposed 2011 budget next week. But Elmendorf said perhaps the most crucial factor in determining the long-term effect of the freeze is what happens in the years after the freeze. If spending immediately goes back to the levels they would have been at had they been rising all along, ""then the savings are just in those three years, and they're small,"" Elmendorf said.For example, Elmendorf said, a freeze on all discretionary appropriations would only save about $10 billion in fiscal year 2011.But, he said, if you essentially reset spending levels and only increase at the rate of inflation after the freeze, ""then you can achieve significant savings over the remaining years."" That's the route White House officials have said they want to go.So that $250 billion figure cited by the White House seems in line with other estimates.And by that measure, Boehner's attempt to put Obama's proposal into context is accurate. A freeze that would cut spending by $250 billion over 10 years amounts to a little more than one half of 1 percent of all government spending over that same period.But he also relied on math that made Obama's freeze look especially tiny because the other number he cited -- $42 trillion in overall spending -- includes mandatory entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid as well as discretionary nondefense and defense programs. If you remove those items, Obama's freeze accounts for a slightly larger share -- about 4 percent over 10 years.The White House, however, puts a more optimistic spin on this statistic saying that by the middle of the decade, nonsecurity discretionary spending would reach its lowest percentage of gross domestic product in 50 years.Still the big-picture point made by Boehner and other Republicans is that Obama's proposed three-year spending freeze, which would apply only to about 17 percent of overall spending, does little to address the ""massive fiscal hole"" he described.""In sum, the outlook for the federal budget is bleak,"" Elmendorf said.So how much of a dent would Obama's freeze make?""As a share of the total deficit problem, it is a small step,"" Elmendorf said.So Obama positioned the spending freeze as a way to rein in the country's mounting debt, and we think it's fair for Boehner to put those spending cuts in the context of overall spending.

Ronnie Earle says income gap steadily widening in Texas, shrinking the middle class
","Ronnie Earle, the former Travis County district attorney seeking the Democratic nod for lieutenant governor, says powerful interests hold more sway at the Capitol than regular folks. According to The Austin Chronicle, he went farther afield before the NXNW Austin Democrats Jan. 18, saying: “Inequality in Texas is steadily getting worse, with very few rich people, a great many poor people, and fewer and fewer in the middle.”  We wondered if the former prosecutor had stated his case on inequality correctly.  Earle shared with us outside research suggesting growing gaps in household income nationally as well as in Texas, beginning in the late 1990's.  For instance, research by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Economic Policy Institute found that the incomes of the poorest fifth of Texas families and the middle fifth of families didn’t change significantly between the late ‘90s and about 2005. Meantime, the average income of the richest fifth of Texas families increased by $10,505, or 9 percent, to $126,658.  What about more recently? Karl Eschbach, the Texas state demographer, shared estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau that showed the distribution of Texas families across the income scale barely changed from 2000 through 2008, though inequality increased slightly.  As of 2008, the state’s wealthiest 20 percent of households accounted for nearly 51 percent of income. That is, about half the money taken home that year went to the richest Texans.  The next-wealthiest 40 percent of households garnered 37 percent of income. The remaining 40 percent of households -- the bottom earners in Texas -- got less than 12 percent of total household income.  We also reviewed an indicator that's a widely accepted measure of income inequality.  Scientists use the GINI coefficient to gauge inequality in income across societies. A society that scores 0.0 on the scale has perfect equality, meaning everyone has the same income. The higher the number over zero, the more the inequality. A score of 1.0 indicates total inequality where one person or household corners all the income.  According to Eschbach’s analysis, the GINI coefficient for Texas was .466 in 2008, up slightly from .46 in 2000.   Separately, the Census Bureau estimated a Texas GINI index of .474 for 2008—placing Texas fifth in income inequality among the states, trailing only Louisiana, Mississippi, Connecticut and New York, which topped the dubious category with a GINI index of .503.  James K. Galbraith, a professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, pointed us to research he’s overseen suggesting that income inequality in Texas widened over the past few decades. Texas had a GINI index of .37 in 1970. The index reached .39 in 1980, .42 in 1990 and .47 in 2000 before dropping to .46 in 2004.  With help from a Census Bureau statistician, we tried to assess whether the state's middle class has shrunk.  Kirby Posey, a bureau survey statistician, told us that if the middle class is shrinking in Texas, it's happening slowly.  As of 1990, the middle class accounted for 47 percent of all the state's household income. The share of income attributed to the middle class was 46.6 percent in 2000 and 45.8 percent in 2008, according to the bureau. By and large, Earle correctly noted that Texas is home to lots of poor people and a clutch of the very wealthy.Earle passed along a September press release from the Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs serving low-income Texans, stating that the ranks of Texans living in poverty has likely swelled given the national recession. Even if so, that doesn't necessarily mean that fewer people are in the state's middle class. Eschbach, the state demographer, suggested that because there has been little change in income inequality across Texas over the past decade, more research would be needed before concluding the state's middle class has dwindled.Ultimately, neither Galbraith or Eschbach quibbled with the gist of Earle’s claim.

Boehner says spending has grown by 67 percent in Obama's first year
","One of the most reliable Republican attacks on President Barack Obama has been that he and his allies in Congress are spending too much of the taxpayers' money. In his live-blogging response to Obama's State of the Union address on Jan. 27, 2010, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, criticized Obama's handling of the federal budget by playing off Obama's proposed freeze on domestic spending.""President Obama pledged to go through the budget 'line by line,' "" Boehner wrote, ""but on his watch, nondefense spending has spiraled out of control, increasing by 67 percent in the last year alone.""Analyzing the accuracy of this comment requires an immersion in budget wonkery. Specifically, determining whether Boehner is right depends heavily on whether you are talking about ""budget authority"" or ""outlays.""When Congress approves budget authority, it confers the right to spend money for a certain purpose. But for various reasons, that money may not be spent during the fiscal year when it is authorized. For instance, a given program may take longer than expected to get up and running, employees may not be hired immediately, or, most commonly, lawmakers may intend for the spending to be made in subsequent years. The actual money spent in a given year is referred to as ""outlays.""Let's look at the the various ways to calculate the numbers that Boehner cited.According to the Congressional Budget Office, the federal budget authority for nondefense, discretionary spending in fiscal year 2008 -- the last year under President George W. Bush -- was $494 billion. (Discretionary spending refers to funds appropriated on an annual basis by Congress, while mandatory spending -- a separate category -- includes required programs such as Social Security, as well as interest on the federal debt.)The budget authority for nondefense, discretionary spending in 2009 -- including budget authority from the 2009 stimulus bill -- was $803 billion. That's an increase of about 63 percent -- quite close to what Boehner's blog post suggested.But not all the budget authority conveyed by the stimulus bill was exercised in 2009. In fact, of the $268 billion in budget authority conveyed for 2009, only about $35 billion was actually spent in 2009, or roughly 13 percent of the total budget authority.So if you remove from the calculations the unspent budget authority from the stimulus -- sticking instead to the nondefense discretionary outlays in both the regular budget and the stimulus -- the increase from 2008 to 2009 was 11.3 percent. That's quite a bit less than what was suggested by Boehner's blog post.""It's very misleading,"" said Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. He said Boehner essentially took more than one year's expenditures and counted them in a single year. We talked to Boehner's office, and staffers acknowledged that the congressman's phrasing could have been more accurate. But they maintained that their larger point holds.""Congressional Democrats voted to increase spending by 67 percent,"" Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said. ""That’s the way the American people understand it. You can quibble about the arcana of budget wonk terminology, but they voted to spend the money, and we’re very comfortable using that figure.""Boehner gets some outside backup. Brian Riedl, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that calculating budget authority is not totally out of left field. It's a ""measure of congressional intent,"" he said.But because Boehner wrote that nondefense spending ""has spiraled out of control,"" to use numbers that refer to budget authority are, at best, misleading. In this case, the difference between those two methods isn't trivial, thanks to the unusual circumstances of a massive, multiyear spending bill being passed in 2009. In essence, calculating it Boehner's way turns a comparatively modest spending increase into a whopping one. For that reason, we rate his statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/jan/28/john-boehner/boehner-says-spending-has-grown-67-percent-obamas-/

Boehner says a majority of Americans oppose health care bill
","In a live-blogging response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union Address, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, wrote that ""a majority of Americans still oppose this health care bill.""We looked at recent polls to see if Boehner was correct.Using the archive at the Web site pollster.com, we found 10 relevant polls taken in January 2010 that were nonpartisan and conducted by telephone -- traditional benchmarks for highly credible polls. The exact wording of the questions varied from poll to poll, but all asked whether the respondent supports or opposes the health care plan being considered in Congress.Five out of the 10 polls found that a clear majority of respondents opposed the health care bill. From most recent to oldest, they were:• CNN: 38 percent in favor and 58 percent opposed• ABC News/Washington Post: 44 percent in favor and 51 percent opposed• Fox News: 39 percent in favor and 51 percent oppposed• Quinnipiac University: 34 percent in favor and 54 percent opposed• Another poll from CNN: 40 percent in favor and 57 percent opposedTwo other polls found a sizable plurality -- but not a majority -- of respondents opposing the health care bill:• NBC News/Wall Street Journal: 31 percent in favor and 46 percent opposed• Another poll from NBC News/Wall Street Journal: 33 percent in favor and 46 percent opposedOne showed a tie:• Associated Press/GfK: 42 percent for each viewAnd two showed a narrow plurality in support of the health care bill, but within the poll's margin of error:• Kaiser Family Foundation/Princeton Survey Research Associates: 42 percent in favor and 41 percent opposed• Gallup: 49 percent in favor and 46 percent opposedThe Gallup poll may have attracted somewhat more support because of the question's wording, which did not refer to the specific health care bills now being considered. That poll's question was, ""Would you advise your Member of Congress to vote for or against a health care bill this year, or do you not have an opinion?"" But even that question could not garner a plurality of support outside the margin of error.A major factor accounting for the differences in these poll results was that some had large percentages of respondents saying they had no opinion or were uncertain, while others did not.Seven of the polls did not offer an explicit ""no opinion"" option when asking the question, and five of those polls led to outright majorities for opponents of the health care bill. By contrast, among the three polls that did offer a ""no opinion"" option, one was the Gallup poll showing a plurality in favor of the health care plan, a second was the AP poll showing a tie, and a third was the NBC poll showing 31 percent in favor and 46 percent opposed.These differences are illuminated by a separate line of questioning in the Kaiser poll. That poll demonstrated that respondents are not always sure what policies are actually included in the health care proposal. When presented with a list of policy provisions, 8 percent to 25 percent of respondents, depending on the provision, said they were not sure if the idea was included in the proposal or not.""Even after a year of substantial media coverage of the health reform debate, many Americans remain unfamiliar with key elements of the major bills passed by the House and Senate,"" Kaiser concluded. The foundation added that ""awareness can matter. Among the least known elements of the bills, those with the biggest potential to change minds include the fact that the Congressional Budget Office has said health reform would reduce the deficit (only 15% expect the legislation to reduce the deficit, but 56% said hearing that makes them more supportive) and that the legislation would stop insurers from charging women more than men (37% are aware that the legislation would do this, but 50% said this provision makes them more supportive).""So, Boehner would have been on firm ground if he'd said that more Americans oppose the health care bill than support it. Instead, he said ""a majority of Americans still oppose this health care bill,"" something that was strictly true in only half the January polls we looked at.That said, Boehner is not far off. In none of the 10 polls we looked at did supporters outnumber opponents by an amount larger than the margin of error. So we'll knock down the minority leader for his imprecise language and rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jan/28/john-boehner/boehner-says-majority-americans-oppose-health-care/

National debt on pace to triple in 10 years, now more than $100k per household, GOP claims
","Recently elected Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell took up the flag for Republicans in response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Jan. 27, 2010.That meant talking about spending, deficits and debt.""In the past year, more than 3 million people have lost their jobs, and yet the Democratic Congress continues deficit spending, adding to the bureaucracy, and increasing the national debt on our children and our grandchildren,"" McDonnell said in a speech from the floor of the Virginia House of Delegates. ""The amount of debt is on pace to double in five years and triple in 10. The federal debt is now over $100,000 per household. This is simply unsustainable.""We wanted to check two things: Whether the debt is growing as fast as McDonnell says, and whether it now constitutes $100,000 per household.First things first -- a quick but critical lesson on the federal debt. The debt clock you're use to seeing, the one that's ticking past $12.3 trillion these days, actually is the summation of two types of debt. The first part is the money the government borrowed to pay for things -- wars, roads, whatever. The second is debt held by government trust funds and government accounts that are internal transactions (government passing money from one fund to another). In these cases, there is no effect on the credit markets. (Read the Treasury Department's Q&A on debt here.)The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, says the first form of debt is a more meaningful measure. It's the combination of both types of debt, however, that gets most noticed, surely because it's bigger but also because it's what the debt ceiling is based on. McDonnell's claim that the debt is on pace to double in five years and triple in 10 is not a new talking point for Republicans. Judd Gregg (the Republican senator from New Hampshire who was almost Obama's commerce secretary) said the same thing about Obama's proposed 2010 budget last March.To check Gregg, we relied on a Congressional Budget Office analysis from March 20, 2009. The CBO projected that the debt held by the public (the first part of the total debt) would rise from $5.8 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2008 -- which is Sept. 30, 2008 -- to $11.8 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2013; and to $17.3 trillion in 2019 under Obama's proposed FY 2010 budget. By that count, Gregg's claim of doubling the debt in five years, tripling it in 10 years, is correct.But in Gregg's case we found it a little unfair to tie some of the debt to Obama and not President George W. Bush. We rated Gregg's claim Mostly True.Now on to McDonnell.Just hours ahead of McDonnell's response, the CBO released updated baseline debt projections that shrink the amount of debt predicted over the next 10 years. The CBO put the debt held by the public at the end of fiscal year 2008 at $5.8 trillion, $7.5 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2009, and estimates the debt will increase to $11.6 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2014 and to $14.3 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2019. Again, this is just the first part of the debt calculation. That's a decrease from the projections the CBO put out in response to Obama's 2010 budget. In checking this claim, like when considering Gregg's claim, the truth depends on where you start counting the debt.If you set your baseline as Sept. 30, 2008, the national debt is on pace to nearly triple by Sept. 30, 2019, as McDonnell suggests. If you recalculate for Sept. 30, 2009, the national debt doubles, not triples in 10 years. Now, for argument's sake, we wanted to run the same calculation for the entire gross federal debt. (You will see why this matters in a second.) According to the CBO, the gross federal debt ended 2009 at $11.9 trillion, will hit $16.7 trillion by the end of 2014 and $20.6 trillion by the end of 2019. That's short of McDonnell's marks as well. The percentages don't improve much even if you roll back to 2008 -- we're talking again about doubling the debt after 10 years, not tripling. So unlike comparing the debt held by the public, McDonnell's numbers are off whether you start counting Sept. 30, 2008, or Sept. 30, 2009. White House debt projections from August 2009 are a slightly worse, but not enough to make a change when considering McDonnell's claim. As we try to digest all of that, let's turn to the second part of McDonnell's claim: ""The federal debt is already over $100,000 per household.""The Census Bureau estimated in 2007 that there were nearly 116 million U.S. households. The current debt held by the public -- the money the government has borrowed -- is $7.8 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The current gross debt is $12.3 trillion.Presto, chango, carry the one, move the decimal point ... and you get two different debt per household figures.The household share of the debt owed by the public is about $67,000. The household share of the gross federal debt is slightly more than $106,000.McDonnell's press secretary, Stacey Johnson, did not return two phone calls or an e-mail asking for clarification on what debt figures the governor was using to make his calculations.Why does it matter?If he's using the gross debt figure -- the big one -- McDonnell is right about the per household number and wrong about the doubling and tripling.If he's using the smaller debt held by the public number, he has a case to make about growth of the debt, but is wrong when it comes to the per household share.Or he's mixing one form of debt to make one point, and another to make a second.In his State of the Union response, McDonnell tried using both the macro and the micro to drive home a point that spending led by the Democrats in the White House and Congress is out of control. His claim that national debt is on pace to double in five years and triple in 10 isn't wildly off, but it ignores the fact that some of the responsibility falls on Bush's shoulders. On his second claim, that the per household share of the national debt is more than $100,000, that's true if you measure the gross federal debt and false if you only count the money the government actually borrowed from somebody else. On the whole, we rate McDonnell's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jan/28/bob-mcdonnell/national-debt-pace-triple-10-years-now-more-100k-h/

McDonnell says Virginia first in line for Atlantic oil drilling
","In the Republican response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union speech, newly elected Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell said his state had the chance to be the first on the Atlantic coast to drill offshore for oil and natural gas.""Advances in technology can unleash more natural gas, nuclear, wind, coal, alternative energy that will lower your utility bills,"" McDonnell said Jan. 27, 2010, from the floor of Virginia's House of Delegates. ""Here in Virginia, we have the opportunity to become the first state on the East Coast to explore for and produce oil and natural gas offshore."" If drilling happens in the Atlantic, is Virginia first in line?Drilling in the Atlantic -- like in the eastern Gulf of Mexico -- has been taboo until recently. The Minerals Management Service, an arm of the U.S. Department of the Interior, has not held a lease sale for oil or natural gas drilling in the Atlantic since 1983. No leases remain active. The MMS, however, included 2.9 million acres off the shores of Virginia as part of its 2007-2012 gas and oil leasing program. But exploration was prohibited by both executive order and a congressional moratorium.That changed in the summer of 2008. President George W. Bush lifted the executive order banning drilling, then Congress allowed the moratorium to expire.In November of that year, the MMS initiated what it called a ""multiyear"" leasing process for the rights to drill off Virginia's coast. The area potentially open to drilling would start 50 miles offshore and sits north of the opening of the Chesapeake Bay, closest to Virginia's Eastern Shore counties on the Delmarva Peninsula. The MMS says the area may contain 130 million barrels of oil and 1.14 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. It's the only area in the Atlantic under consideration.Why is McDonnell bringing this up?He believes the Obama administration has done little to move the lease sale ahead. The MMS says it won't happen before 2011.In a letter to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Dec. 23, 2009, McDonnell pressed for prompt action, saying drilling could create 2,578 new jobs over 10 years and $271 million in state and local taxes. Those figures, which McDonnell says were based on a 2005 report by the former president of Old Dominion University, subsequently have been questioned. But that's not what we're checking.McDonnell said Virginia was ready to ""be the first state on the East Coast to explore for and produce oil and natural gas offshore."" Indeed, the nearly 3 million acres off the coast of Virginia is the only area in the Atlantic in the federal government's current five-year oil and gas leasing program. It also is the only area currently in the leasing process. It puts Virginia at the head of the class. And it makes McDonnell right.

Tax cut for 95 percent? The stimulus made it so
","President Barack Obama talked a lot about economic recovery during his State of the Union address on Jan. 27, 2010, including the benefits of the economic stimulus bill passed last year.The stimulus, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, included tax cuts for many Americans, Obama said. ""We cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. We cut taxes for small businesses,"" Obama said. ""We cut taxes for first-time homebuyers. We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children. We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college.""Democrats applauded, while Republicans were silent for the most part. In one of the unscripted moments of the night, Obama looked at the Republican side of the room, smiled and said, ""I thought I'd get some applause on that one."" Here, we wanted to check Obama's statement that he cut taxes for 95 percent of working families.The key word in his statement is ""working."" Obama's claim is based on a tax cut intended to offset payroll taxes. Under the stimulus bill, single workers got $400, and working couples got $800. The Internal Revenue Service issued new guidelines to reduce withholdings for income tax, so many workers saw a small increase in their checks in April 2009.The tax cut was part of Obama's campaign promises. During the campaign, Obama said he wanted $500 for each worker and $1,000 for working couples. Since the final number was a bit less than he promised, we rated his promise a Compromise on our Obameter, where we rate Obama's campaign promises for fulfillment. During the campaign, the independent Tax Policy Center researched how Obama's tax proposals would affect workers. It concluded 94.3 percent of workers would receive a tax cut under Obama's plan based on the tax credit to offset payroll taxes. According to the analysis, the people who wouldn't get a tax cut are those who make more than $250,000 for couples or $200,000 for a single person. Obama said he intended to raise taxes on those high earners, a promise he reiterated during the State of the Union, and that revenue would offset the stimulus tax cut.

Why Alito shook his head: Obama exaggerates impact of Supreme Court ruling on foreign companies
","Editor's note, Dec. 27, 2018: In a recent column, former Democratic official and Washington Post columnist Ron Klain criticized this 2010 fact-check as having been ""wrongly"" decided. We published a response as to why we stand by the factcheck; read it here.  On Jan. 21, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling striking down barriers to corporations spending money directly from their own treasuries to influence elections. The 5-4 decision in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission has drawn fire from President Barack Obama twice -- first in a weekly radio address and, now, during his State of the Union address.

The president told a joint session of Congress on Jan. 27, 2010, that ""it's time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for federal office. Last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests –- including foreign corporations –- to spend without limit in our elections. Well I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, and worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people, and that's why I'm urging Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to right this wrong.""

That's much the same argument he made in his Jan. 23 radio address, when he argued that ""even foreign corporations may now get into the act"" of spending ""an unlimited amount of special interest money"" for political purposes.

We published an item on Jan. 26 -- one day before the State of the Union address -- that investigated whether the justices' ruling did in fact open the door to foreign companies spending freely on American campaigns. We're updating and expanding it now that Obama has mentioned this issue in his State of the Union address.

First, some background. In Citizens United, the justices overturned previous decisions that prohibited, in the court's words, ""corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech defined as an 'electioneering communication' or for speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate."" While corporations are still barred from giving directly to federal candidates, they are no longer forced to create political action committees in order to spend money on electioneering. A corporation, the justices held, may simply spend funds from its own accounts.

Critics of the majority's opinion warned that allowing political spending by corporations could also undermine existing barriers to foreign corporate spending on elections.

Current federal law -- legal eagles can find it at 2 U.S.C. 441e(b)(3) -- prevents ""a partnership, association, corporation, organization, or other combination of persons organized under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a foreign country"" from making ""directly or indirectly"" a donation or expenditure ""in connection with a Federal, State, or local election,"" to a political party committee or ""for an electioneering communication.""

The majority opinion, authored by Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, maintained that the court was not specifically overturning this barrier to foreign campaign spending, essentially saying that it was outside the scope of the opinion.

""We need not reach the question whether the Government has a compelling interest in preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our Nation's political process,"" the majority wrote.

But in a strongly worded and sometimes bitter dissent, Associate Justice John Paul Stevens latched onto the question of campaign spending by foreign companies as an example of the majority opinion's shortcomings, bringing it up no fewer than three times.

""The notion that Congress might lack the authority to distinguish foreigners from citizens in the regulation of electioneering would certainly have surprised the Framers,"" said Stevens. He went on to quote Fordham University law professor Zephyr Rain Teachout's observation that the Framers' ""obsession with foreign influence derived from a fear that foreign powers and individuals had no basic investment in the well-being of the country."" (Teachout, incidentally, directed Internet organizing for Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign.)

But passionate as his view is, Stevens' dissent holds no legal authority.

Indeed, the legal experts we spoke to after Obama's radio address said that the president was overstating the immediate impact of the opinion. They said Obama was correct that the ruling could open the door to foreign companies spending on American campaigns, given the general direction of the majority's opinion. But because the majority justices didn't actually strike down the existing barriers on foreign companies -- in fact, they explicitly wrote that it fell beyond the boundaries of their decision -- our experts agreed that Obama erred by suggesting that the issue is settled law. Until test cases proceed and further rulings are handed down, Obama's claim about foreign campaign spending is a reasonable interpretation, and nothing more.

""Some people think that Kennedy's opinion in Citizens United logically leads there,"" said Robert Kelner, who chairs the election and political law practice group at the law firm Covington & Burling. ""Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. We don't know for sure.""

Brett Kappel, a political law specialist with the law firm Arent Fox, said the Citizens United opinion ""certainly could be read as declaring this provision unconstitutional, so I'd have to say the president's interpretation is correct -- but we won't really know for sure until a court rules on the issue.""

Critics of the ruling -- including some readers who contacted PolitiFact after we posted our original analysis -- have zeroed in on one scenario in particular, ""that foreign corporations with U.S. subsidiaries are likely to be able to now spend unlimited amounts on American elections,"" in the words of the liberal blog Think Progress. In one theoretical example offered by the Web site Politico, ""even if Sony Corp. in Japan couldn't spend money directly for or against a candidate, the electronics company's American-based subsidiaries could.""

According to Politico, the White House and Democratic lawmakers have been discussing legislation to mitigate the impact of the ruling, including directly addressing the question of how foreign companies should be treated.

The scenario involving foreign-owned U.S. subsidiaries hinges on a quirk in the law that had seemed to be of little consequence, but which now may loom large. The federal law cited above -- 2 U.S.C. 441e(b)(3) -- defines U.S. companies as those incorporated under U.S. law or that have their headquarters here. It is silent on the treatment of companies that are incorporated and headquartered in the United States but are owned by foreigners.

That uncertainty could indeed provide a loophole for spending unlimited amounts of money on politics. But even that interpretation is not a slam dunk. Federal Election Commission regulations say that a foreign national cannot ""direct, dictate, control, or directly or indirectly participate in the decision-making process"" for spending money for political purposes, a principle that could keep the critics' worst-case scenario from coming true, said Tara Malloy, an associate counsel with the Campaign Legal Center. What that FEC regulation means for political spending by a foreign-owned company is far from clear.

So, if anything, uncertainties about how foreign-owned U.S. subsidiaries would be treated only further muddies the question. Based on our reading of the court's opinion and interviews with campaign law experts, we find that Obama has overstated the ruling's immediate impact on foreign companies' ability to spend unlimited money in U.S. political campaigns. While such an outcome may be possible, the majority opinion specifically said it wasn't addressing that point, and only further litigation would settle the matter once and for all. So we find Obama's claim to be Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2010/jan/28/barack-obama/obama-says-supreme-court-ruling-allows-foreign-com/

Obama claims U.S. budget went from surplus to deficit in 10 years
","A big part of President Barack Obama's first State of the Union speech on Jan. 27, 2010, focused on the economy. To set the stage, he said his predecessor was largely responsible for the country's fiscal shape. ""At the beginning of the last decade ... America had a budget surplus of over $200 billion,"" Obama said. ""By the time I took office, we had a one-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade. Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program."" We've checked several claims to this effect in the last year, most recently one by Obama adviser David Axelrod. Indeed, we found that the government was enjoying a surplus of about $236 billion circa 2001. Later, when Obama took office, the Congressional Budget Office reported the deficit was over $1.2 trillion. A good chunk of the deficits racked up by the Bush administration came from tax cuts, the war in Iraq and actions that Bush and a Democratic Congress took to prop up the economy right before he left office. In the same report, the CBO projected a 10-year deficit of about $3.1 trillion. But Obama said $8 trillion, based on budget numbers published by the White House Office of Management and Budget shortly after Obama took office. Why the discrepancy? When we checked the similar claim by Axelrod, we spoke with Josh Gordon, policy director for the Concord Coalition. He said it has to do with how the two offices estimate the future. The CBO bases its projections on the assumption that the Bush tax cuts would expire in 2010 and that a patch to fix the alternative minimum tax would expire, among other things. The White House does not; instead, it assumes that nothing changes in current law.So, Obama's overall point is correct that the government was enjoying a substantial surplus when Bush took office and had a big deficit when he departed; he's spot on about the surplus Bush began with. He's also correct about the deficit at the end of Bush's presidency, but there are two different ways to measure the 10-year projection when Bush left office. The CBO's estimate is $5 trillion lower than the White House numbers, though economists don't quibble with the White House methodology. So given that discussion, we'll take Obama down a notch to Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jan/28/barack-obama/obama-claims-us-budget-went-surplus-deficit-ten-ye/

Obama says lobbyists have been excluded from policy-making jobs
","In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama touted his efforts to bar lobbyists from his administration.""We've excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs or seats on federal boards and commissions,"" he said on Jan. 27, 2010.That rang a bell with us because we have tracked a campaign promise he made on that topic. He had promised that ""No political appointees in an Obama-Biden administration will be permitted to work on regulations or contracts directly and substantially related to their prior employer for two years. And no political appointee will be able to lobby the executive branch after leaving government service during the remainder of the administration.""We rated that one a Promise Broken because his policy has substantial loopholes that have allowed Obama to essentially decide when he wants to ignore the rule.He's right that on his first day in office, he signed an executive order to bar lobbyists from his administration.But the order also included a loophole — a ""waiver"" clause that allows former lobbyists to serve. Waivers are granted by the administration itself, so they are little more than the administration saying it's okay for the lobbyist to work for the administration. The executive order says a waiver may be granted if ""the literal application of the restriction is inconsistent with the purposes of the restriction"" or ""it is in the public interest. ... The public interest shall include, but not be limited to, exigent circumstances relating to national security or to the economy."" Another provision allows lobbyists to serve if they agree to recuse themselves from discussions related to their former jobs.Still, open government groups have given Obama high marks for reducing the number of lobbyists at the White House and for making the process more transparent than other administrations.""I think that by any fair measure ... the reported number is certainly much fewer,"" said Meredith McGehee, policy director for the Campaign Legal Center. ""In fact, I'd say the waivers are good. It allows them to go in and say, 'Here's someone we think has unique skills.' ""One of the first Obama appointees to get a waiver was William J. Lynn to be deputy secretary of defense, the No. 2 position at the Pentagon. Lynn was a Raytheon lobbyist for six years, lobbying extensively on a broad range of defense-related issues.Jocelyn Frye, director of policy and projects in the Office of the First Lady, also got a waiver. Previously, Frye lobbied for the National Partnership for Women and Families from 2001 to 2008. The organization advocates for fairness in the workplace, access to health care and ""policies that help women and men meet the dual demands of work and family.""And Cecilia Muñoz, director of intergovernmental affairs in the Executive Office of the President, manages the White House's relationships with state and local governments and is a principal liaison to the Hispanic community. Formerly, Muñoz formerly lobbied for National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization.The White House has issued seven waivers to its ethics rules, which apply to lobbyists as well as to people who served as officers and directors of a company or organization. And agencies have issued 15. The White House has said these waivers are quite rare -- less than 1 percent of the thousands of appointments that have been made.What about those recusals we mentioned earlier? The administration has not made public how many of these have been issued. We do know that Mark Patterson, the chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, took one -- but that information was only released by the White House after lawmakers and media reports started asking questions. Public records show Patterson worked as a lobbyist for Goldman Sachs in 2008.Obama said that he has ""excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs."" But that's not the case. We know of at least four that have taken on policymaking roles in the Obama administration -- Frye's title even contains the word ""policy.""

Obama credits pay-as-you-go rule with producing 1990s surpluses
","In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama reiterated his praise for ""pay as you go,"" a budget approach that is supposed to force lawmakers to offset new spending with an equal amount of revenue or budget cuts.The president told a joint session of Congress on Jan. 27, 2010, that the ""pay-as-you-go law ... was a big reason why we had record surpluses in the 1990s.""We originally analyzed a similar comment he made on May 7, 2009. Back then, he said, ""One important step is restoring the 'pay as you go' rule — and I've called on Congress to do exactly that. This rule says, very simply, that Congress can only spend a dollar if it saves a dollar elsewhere.  This is the principle that guides responsible families managing a budget. This is the principle that helped transform large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s.""We wondered then, and now, whether he was correct about the role of 'pay as you go' -- or PAYGO -- in balancing the federal budget in the 1990s.We found that Obama is correct that Congress operated under a PAYGO law that was in effect from 1990 until it expired in 2002. When the Democrats took control of Congress after the 2006 elections, they established a PAYGO rule, but it has been waived for some of the most expensive bills, such as the economic stimulus bill. Fiscal hawks are urging Congress to replace that rule with a new law that would have more impact and be more binding.Obama is also right, of course, that the federal budget was balanced by 1998 and ran four years of surpluses before plunging back into deficits. The question is how much to credit PAYGO for those surpluses.To find the answer, we interviewed budget analysts and examined reports on the deficit and the impact of PAYGO. During our round of interviews, we found a general consensus that PAYGO was a factor that reduced the deficit, but most said it was not as important as the two biggest forces that led to a balanced budget: the increase in tax receipts from the booming economy and defense cuts made possible by the end of the Cold War.Still, there was a range of opinion on how much the rule helped.Alice Rivlin, budget chief under President Bill Clinton, characterized PAYGO as a significant factor. She said in a recent interview on PBS's Frontline that PAYGO and other budget rules ""made it easier for the Clinton administration to work on the budget deficit.""She said the PAYGO rule provided discipline so policymakers could resist tempting but expensive programs. The rule ""meant that the president could say no, and the Congress could say no to a lot of good-sounding ideas, including Medicare prescription drugs"" that would have made it difficult to balance the budget.That's backed up by a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that said, ""Between 1991 and 1997, most new revenue and mandatory spending laws that were enacted were consistent with the PAYGO requirement to be deficit neutral; end-of-session balances on the PAYGO scorecard consistently showed zero or net reductions in the deficit.""Josh Gordon, policy director for the Concord Coalition, a group that advocates fiscal responsibility and was founded in the midst of the PAYGO movement in 1992, said PAYGO provided some important discipline for members of Congress even if it was not as big a factor as the booming economy and the defense cuts. ""There always needs to be a check on irresponsibility in Congress and PAYGO provides that,"" he said.But Brian Riedl, a budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation, said PAYGO's importance has been exaggerated. ""There is this grand myth that we passed PAYGO and then we got this balanced budget. But we got the balanced budget because the Cold War ended and a bubble temporarily pushed revenues through the roof.""He said that PAYGO didn't provide as much discipline as some claim because Congress repeatedly used gimmicks or took steps to ignore it.So back to Obama's claim. He said the ""pay-as-you-go law ... was a big reason why we had record surpluses in the 1990s."" He is correct that it is a basic principle behind the effort to balance the budget, but his statement somewhat overstates the policy's importance in achieving that goal.Yes, PAYGO rules provided some discipline that might have restrained Congress from adding more spending or new tax cuts, but the economy and the defense cuts were the biggest factors that led to the balanced budget. So we find his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jan/28/barack-obama/obama-credits-pay-you-go-rule-producing-1990s-surp/

Obama claims 2 million more Americans would be unemployed if not for stimulus
","The number of jobs ""saved or created"" by the massive economic stimulus championed by President Barack Obama has been a matter of intense partisan disagreement all year, and no doubt the president's claims in his State of the Union address will reignite the debate.""Because of the steps we took"" in the stimulus, Obama said, ""there are about 2 million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed.""Obama's numbers come from a Jan. 13, 2010, report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which concluded that through the fourth quarter of 2009, the stimulus raised employment relative to what it otherwise would have been by 1.5 million to 2 million jobs.So right off the bat, the president has chosen to highlight the top end of his own advisers' projection. And it is a projection, as the CEA report acknowledges, subject to a large margin of error. ""As we have emphasized, measuring what a policy action has contributed to growth and employment is inherently difficult because we do not observe what would have occurred without the policy,"" the report states. ""Therefore, it must be understood that our estimates are subject to substantial margins of error. The results, however, are strong enough and clear enough that we are confident that the basic conclusions are solid. That a wide range of private and government analysts concur with our estimates adds a reassuring check on our analysis.""Let's taker a look at some of those other private and government analyses.The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan government agency regularly cited by politicians in both parties, pegged the number of jobs saved or created by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2009 at somewhere between 800,000 and 2.4 million. That's obviously an extremely wide range, which the CBO said was ""intended to reflect the uncertainty of such estimates and to encompass most economists’ views on the effects of fiscal stimulus."" Obama's number is within that range, but well toward the high end.As an aside, the CBO recently revised its projection of the cost of the stimulus, estimating that it will cost $75 billion more than originally anticipated. The new estimate is that the stimulus will increase budget deficits by $862 billion over the next decade.The CEA report notes projections from several other economic forecasters: IHS/Global Impact, which projected the number jobs saved or created by the stimulus in 2009 at 1.25 million; Macroeconomic Advisers, 1 million; and Moody's Economy.com, 1.6 million. Obama's 2 million number is rosier than all of those projections.Many Republicans have attacked the ""saved or created"" numbers cited by the White House as ridiculous in light of an unemployment rate hovering around 10 percent; and the loss of roughly 3 million more jobs since the stimulus was passed.""There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that the stimulus has saved or created any jobs, let alone 2 million,"" said Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation.""It's impossible to know how the economy would have performed without the stimulus,"" Riedl said, and he finds it ""implausible"" that the country would have lost 5 million jobs in 2009 (the 3 million lost plus 2 million ""saved"" by the stimulus) if the stimulus had not passed. ""I don't know how they can back that up.""It's a classic case of single-entry bookkeeping, Riedl said. The government is just shifting jobs from one part of the economy to another, he said. The $250 billion spent by the federal government surely created jobs, he said, but fails to account for pulling $250 billion borrowed by the federal government from other sectors of the economy. ""That's money that would have been spent somewhere else in the economy,"" Riedl said. ""The effect is that you are going to cancel stuff out. That's why unemployment numbers aren't dropping.""For the president's numbers to be true, Riedl said, you'd have to assume those who lent the federal government the money would otherwise have stuffed that $250 billion ""in a mattress or put it in a safe.""However, Gus Faucher, director of macroeconomics at Moody's Economy.com, said while Riedl's argument might hold water in robust economic times, the fact is that when the government passed the stimulus, ""People weren't borrowing; the demand wasn't there.""The last Moody's projection was for the third quarter of last year, he said, and at that point, Moody's estimated that employment was about 1.1 million greater than it would have been without the stimulus. Faucher expects that when fourth quarter numbers are added, that number will be closer to 1.5 million.""I would say that he (Obama) is in the ballpark,"" Faucher said. ""It may be a little high, but not ridiculously high.""But, he warned, these numbers are all just economic projections. ""By definition, this is an art, not a science,"" Faucher said.And that's our biggest issue with Obama's definitive claim that if not for the stimulus, 2 million Americans working right now would otherwise be unemployed. It's a projection. Economists can't say for sure what would have happened if the stimulus had not passed, and whether those who got jobs through the stimulus would otherwise be unemployed. And while the number cited by Obama is backed up by the projections from his Council of Economic Advisers, it's on the high side of the projections from the CBO, and significantly higher than projections from several other economic forecasters. And so we rate Obama's claim Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jan/28/barack-obama/obama-claims-two-million-more-americans-would-be-u/
