Boehner claims city uses stimulus money to hire someone to apply for more stimulus money
","And now, the story of little Washington meets big Washington. In a tongue-in-cheek Web ad from House Republican leader John Boehner, the GOP ""releases the dogs on the money trail"" to find jobs created by the Obama-backed economic stimulus package. Ellie Mae, the GOP's job-sniffing bloodhound, found two things of interest. We dealt with one, the impact of a federally funded bridge on Rusty's Backwater Saloon in Stevens Point, Wis., with  this Truth-O-Meter ruling  . Here we'll address Ellie Mae's discovery that ""in North Carolina, they used stimulus money to hire one new state worker. His job: apply for more stimulus funds from the taxpayers by the way of the federal government."" Which brings us to little Washington ... Washington, N.C., population around 10,000. This small city in the inland coastal region of North Carolina first came under the national microscope with the release of a report from Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., called ""100 Stimulus Projects: A Second Opinion."" At No. 65 on Coburn's list of questionable stimulus projects: ""Washington, North Carolina, is using stimulus funds to pay for 'project-funding manager' whose job it is to secure even more stimulus funds. The city hopes to pay the new 'project funding manager' to identify available stimulus money using a $40,234 grant from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program which, in turn, received funding through the stimulus bill."" We called Washington, N.C., city officials to get to the bottom of this. First off, the city of Washington did hire someone in late February whose job it is to seek out stimulus money for which the city might be eligible. The part-time job was titled ""stimulus coordinator"" and was performed by Bianca Gentile. But Gentile wasn't paid through stimulus money. Her wages have been ""100 percent paid with local fire, police, water utility, sewer utility and electric utility funds,"" according to the City Manager James C. Smith in a letter to the Office of Economic Recovery and Investment in North Carolina. The city's top priority these days is building a new police station. The current building is more than 40 years old. It's ""way too small for the size of our force,"" said Mayor Judy Jennette. And it's also prone to flooding during hurricanes, which is especially troublesome because the city's 911 dispatchers are housed there too. The estimated cost — $12 million. With 24 percent of Washington's citizens categorized as low income, Jennette said, the price tag is just too steep for local taxpayers to bear alone. One of the stimulus opportunities identified by Gentile, the city-paid stimulus coordinator, was a planner who could help the city gets its police station. The city applied for — and got — an Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance grant for $40,234 to fund the one-year cost of a Law Enforcement Economic Assistance Coordinator. The stimulus did provide $2 billion to the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program, so the Boehner ad (and Coburn's report) is correct in saying the position was funded through the stimulus. But the idea that the job can be summarized as simply to ""apply for more stimulus funds,"" is incorrect, Washington, N.C., officials said. Here's how the job description reads: ""Under limited supervision, (the coordinator) facilitates and conducts research and statistical analysis related to police and municipal programming. This includes the preparation of various reports, departmental strategic plans and programmatic/project evaluations and reports. The LEDP initiates, conducts, and implements research studies and surveys in support of multiple grant programs to provide a basis for management control, decision making and an improved quality life. Performs related duties as assigned."" There are then nine bulleted items under ""duties, functions and responsibilities."" We won't bore you with all of them, but among them are compiling data for reports on police performance and community development initiatives and attending conferences, conventions and other educational and professional meetings to keep updated on planning methods and administration. And yes, part of one bullet notes that the coordinator will ""provide narrative material for grant proposals."" In other words, he or she will pursue federal grant money to help offset the cost of the police station. But Gentile and other city officials say they're not aware of any stimulus money the city could get for that purpose. Rather, according to Gentile and the mayor, the coordinator will likely target grant funding and/or low-interest loans from USDA, FEMA, Homeland Security and federal and state sources. The job has nothing to do with getting stimulus money, said Gentile, who plans to apply for the job. ""To the best of my knowledge, there is no stimulus money available that we could use for a police station,"" Gentile said. Any responsible local government would try to find as much outside grant money as it can, said Mayor Jennette: ""We are simply trying to build a new police station as cost effectively as we can for our citizens."" We'll concede that the ad is catchy. It ridicules the stimulus as wasteful and ineffective. And it would be a great zinger if indeed stimulus money had been used to hire someone to get more stimulus money. But that's not supported by the facts. Yes, the city of Washington, N.C., got $40,234 in stimulus money to pay for an employee whose job,  in part,  will be to pursue federal grant money to help offset the cost of a new police station. But there's a difference between federal grants and the stimulus, and city officials say there doesn't appear to be any stimulus money available for this project. So the ad has a catchy line, but it's not true. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC875740>],/factchecks/2009/jul/07/john-boehner/boehner-claims-city-uses-stimulus-money-hire-someo/

Boehner ad says stimulus paid for a Bridge to Rusty's
","In a hokey Web ad from House Republican leader John Boehner last week, the GOP ""releases the dogs on the money trail"" to find jobs created by the Obama-backed economic stimulus package. The stimulus was supposed to be all about jobs, according to the folksy narration by Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., ""but after five months and billions in debt on our kids and grandkids, where are the jobs?"" Here's what the job-sniffing GOP bloodhound Ellie Mae finds: ""In Wisconsin, the stimulus paid for a bridge to a bar called Rusty's Backwater Saloon,"" Westmoreland says. ""They've got great burgers, but no new jobs."" The 85-foot bridge in question spans Rocky Run, a creek off the Wisconsin River in Stevens Point, Wis. The project to replace the bridge got $840,000 in stimulus money. State bridge inspection reports show the bridge carries an average of 260 vehicles a day. According to Dale Peterson, Portage County assistant highway commissioner, most of the traffic using the bridge is people going to and from the Wisconsin River Golf Course (a public course). It's also used by crews for Consolidated Paper driving to the company's waste treatment plant. And there's a small development going in, about 20 homes, whose residents will use the bridge. That's why the 20-year projections show the average daily usage doubling to nearly 600 cars per day. So what about Rusty's Backwater Saloon? A few of its customers  may  use the bridge. But not many, according to Peterson and someone we spoke with at the saloon. The main route to Rusty's is via a more direct highway access nearby. Peterson suspects the Republicans used Rusty's as the example because ""I imagine it made good print."" The ad makes it seem like this is a bridge only to Rusty's. It's not. In fact, Rusty's business would do just fine without it because there are other routes to get to the bar. But we don't want to ignore the ad's bigger point, which is that stimulus money is being spent on a little-used bridge. The  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  did an investigative report of stimulus-funded bridge projects in Wisconsin and found that the vast majority of the bridges awarded money in the first wave of stimulus funding are small, rural bridges that carry less than 1,000 vehicles a day. The Stevens Point bridge is one of 37 little-used bridges that got nearly $16 million in stimulus funding, while many higher-priority, well-traveled bridges were ineligible for the first round of stimulus funding. That's because so-called ""shovel-ready"" projects moved to the front of the line for the first round of stimulus money, state highway officials said. The idea of the stimulus was to get people working on projects that could be started fairly quickly. What does shovel-ready mean? It means the projects have environmental assessment and Army Corps of Engineers permits in hand and engineering and design work is finished. In the case of our little Stevens Point bridge, it has been in the works since 2006. It was designed and ready to go when the stimulus passed in February. In fact, it was originally slated to be replaced in 2009 but got pushed back to 2010 due to lack of available federal funding. ""This wasn't some project we cooked up when the stimulus was passed,"" Peterson said. ""All it needed was funding."" Construction is set to begin in August and is expected to take about three months. Peterson estimates a crew of about a dozen will be used to build the bridge. And the concrete and steel will be purchased locally. So presumably that will create some economic ripple as well. Built in 1937, the bridge is in need of replacement, Peterson said. If it isn't, he said, ultimately they'd have to shut the bridge down, and ""that would affect quite a few people. And more people would be out of work."" ""It does serve a purpose,"" Peterson said. ""I'm happy this is being replaced."" The GOP ad ends with Boehner kneeling behind a hound dog on a manicured lawn. ""I'm John Boehner,"" he says. ""This is Ellie Mae. She hasn't found any stimulus jobs yet. And neither have the American people. It's time to stop runaway spending in Washington and help small businesses get the economy running once again."" Boehner didn't just pluck the Rusty's crack from thin air. On his Web site, he cites a June 16, 2009, story from the  Wall Street Journal  that mentions the bridge. It comes in a story about a report from Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., called ""100 Stimulus Projects: A Second Opinion."" Coburn's report says, ""One small bridge is receiving $840,000, though it only carries 260 vehicles a day on average. It primarily provides access to a golf course and Rusty’s Backwater Saloon, which boasts pontoon rentals and a Steak-A-Rooni for just $5.25."" We realize this Web ad from Boehner was a tongue-in-cheek attack. And let's face it, ""Rusty's Backwater Saloon"" creates a nice visual. But when you single out a project — as Boehner did with the ""Bridge to Rusty's"" — we think he ought to have his facts straight. And the fact is, this Wisconsin bridge is not a bridge solely to Rusty's, as the ad implies. In fact, it's not even the main access point for Rusty's.      And as for the project not creating jobs, we think Ellie Mae's sniffer is a bit off there too. The main point of the stimulus wasn't so much to create burger-flipping jobs on the other end of bridge construction projects, but to to create jobs for people doing the bridge work itself, thereby creating an economic ripple effect. And according to a Wisconsin highway official, at least a dozen construction workers will be used to replace the bridge. But because  some  people may use the bridge to get to Rusty's, and because there's a legitimate argument to be made that many small, rural and barely used bridges got stimulus money while other bigger (arguably more important) projects were ineligible, we'll give Boehner a Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD8A780>],/factchecks/2009/jul/07/john-boehner/boehner-ad-says-stimulus-paid-bridge-rustys/

Obama says that Californians use 40 percent less energy than most
","
President Barack Obama says California is a role model for energy conservation. 


In a June 29, 2009, speech to promote new light bulb efficiency standards, Obama said energy conservation will produce big results in the future, and cited California as an example.

 

""In the late 1970s, the state of California enacted tougher energy-efficiency policies. Over the next three decades, those policies helped create almost 1.5 million jobs. And today, Californians consume 40 percent less energy per person than the national average — which, over time, has prevented the need to build at least 24 new power plants.""

 

That paragraph is chock-full of claims to check, but for now, we're going to focus on the key point of Obama's statement: that because of long-standing energy efficiency standards, ""Californians consume 40 percent less energy per person than the national average.""

 

The White House provided us with a 2008 report written by David Roland-Holst at the University of California-Berkeley to back up Obama's claim. It said that Californians' electricity consumption is 40 percent below the national average. Had Obama specified electricity, he would have been correct. California's low electricity consumption is widely known. More than three decades ago, the state adopted building and appliance efficiency standards, and it required that electricity profits be separate from the amount of energy sold. This prompted utilities to offer incentives to consumers who save energy. 

 

Indeed, since the mid 70s, the amount of electricity used per person has grown by almost 50 percent in the rest of the country while California’s numbers remained relatively flat. For example, in 2006, electricity use in the entire country hovered around 12,000 kilowatt hours per person, while California's was approximately 7,000 kilowatt hours, according to a 2007 report by the the California Energy Commission, a branch of the state government. That's about 40 percent less than the national average.

 

But Obama

said

""energy,"" which includes other sources in addition to electricity, so that is what we are checking.


Our first stop was the Energy Information Agency, where we found that overall energy consumption per person in California is quite low. In 2006, individuals there used about 232 million Btu of energy, which includes natural gas, petroleum and coal.  The state's level was about 30 percent less than the national average of 333 Btu, which ranked the state 47th in the nation.


Statemaster.com, a database that compares states by demographics and economics, shows a similar pattern based on statistics from 2001; then, California ranked 46th in per capita energy consumption.

 

So Obama is correct with his underlying point that California's energy efficiency measures have reduced consumption dramatically, but he is off target with his statistic. It's actually 30 percent lower, not 40 percent as he said. We rate his claim Mostly True.

Mitch McConnell's record distorted by Democratic campaign ad
","
A television ad from the Democratic National Committee gives the impression that Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell hates jobs, unemployment compensation, health care for little children and equal pay for women.
 
Here's the full text of the ad:
 
""When George Bush asked Mitch McConnell to support the policies that brought our economy to its knees, what did he say? Yes, Yes, Yes. But this year, when it came to supporting legislation to create and protect Kentucky jobs, he said no. Help for the unemployed? No. Health care for Kentucky's children? No. Fair pay for women? No.
 
""Call Mitch McConnell. Tell him after eight years of being part of the problem, it's time to be part of the solution.""
 
As the announcer talks, tiny type indicates Senate bill numbers to support the ad's claims. The problem is that the ad takes McConnell's votes and then exaggerates what the votes signify.
 
We'll take the issues in order.
 

McConnell said no to ""legislation to create and protect Kentucky jobs"" and to ""help for the unemployed.""

The Democratic National Committee's documentation on the ad says that the evidence for this statement is that McConnell voted against the economic stimulus bill, also known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. It's true that McConnell voted against the act, as did all but three Republican senators. (The exceptions were Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine and  Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who subsequently switched parties.)
 
But we found evidence that McConnell opposed the bill because of its significant expense, not because he opposed creating jobs or helping the unemployed.
 
The week before the vote, for example, McConnell said he opposed the bill because it ""lacked focus, didn't create enough jobs, had too much permanent government expansion, and was just way too expensive with the national debt already reaching frightening new dimensions.""
 
Republicans in both the Senate and the House supported extensions for unemployment compensation in alternative proposals, but the proposals couldn't pass the Democratic-controlled Senate. McConnell said at the time that Republicans weren't trying to derail the stimulus but make it more efficient.
 
We also found a long list of jobs-oriented projects for which McConnell is requesting money in the next appropriations bill for fiscal year 2010.
 
All this contradicts the impression the ad gives that McConnell said no to creating jobs or helping the unemployed.
 

McConnell said no to ""health care for Kentucky's children.""

The DNC backs up this claim by citing McConnell's vote against an expansion for the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP. The program provides health insurance to children in families with low income. The bill passed anyway with about eight Republicans voting with Democrats, and President Barack Obama signed it into law.
 
McConnell recently sponsored legislation to continue SCHIP under more restrictive eligibility terms than the 2009 legislation. He also voted for the creation of SCHIP in 1997 during the Clinton administration. So again this seems to be a case where McConnell disagreed with the legislative specifics, not the underlying value of health care for children.
 

McConnell said no to ""fair pay for women.""

Here, the DNC pointed to McConnell's vote against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the first law Obama signed after taking office. This bill reversed the effects of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that said workers had to file lawsuits for pay discrimination within 180 days of the first instance of discriminatory pay. The new law says a lawsuit may be filed 180 days from the most recent instance of disciminatory pay.
 
McConnell voted against the bill, but not because he opposes fair pay. ""We have heard a lot of debate over the past few days on fairness,"" McConnell said in a statement. ""Every member of this body supports equal pay for equal work. The Ledbetter bill isn't about fair pay. Pay discrimination has been illegal since 1963. This bill is about effectively eliminating the statute of limitations on pay discrimination.""
 
McConnell supported an amendment proposed by Sen. Kay Baily Hutchison of Texas that said the clock for a lawsuit started ticking when the worker knew or could reasonably have been expected to know about the pay disparity, as well as other restrictions. But the motion failed.
 
All the Democrats voted for the Ledbetter bill, along with five Republicans: Collins, Snowe, Specter, Hutchison and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.
 
To summarize: The ad from the DNC makes sweeping generalizations about what McConnell opposed, to the point of distorting what the votes actually signified. When we dug into the nitty gritty of the Senate votes, we found that McConnell supported alternatives or objected to the legislation for other reasons.
 
The ad says that McConnell opposed legislation to ""create and protect Kentucky jobs,"" ""help for the unemployed,"" ""health care for Kentucky's children,"" and ""fair pay for women."" Actually, McConnell said he supported all of those values, but he didn't agree with Democratic methods for achieving them. It's an important distinction. We rate the ad from the Democratic National Committee as Barely True.

No ACLU lawsuit over cross-shaped headstones
","
We received the following chain e-mail from a reader, who asked us to check it out.
 
""Subject: In Jesus' Name — No! No!
 
""Did you know that the ACLU has filed a suit to have all military cross-shaped headstones removed and another suit to end prayer from the military completely? They're making great progress. The Navy Chaplains can no longer mention Jesus' name in prayer thanks to the wretched ACLU and our new administration.""
 
There's a lot packed into that e-mail, but here, we're checking whether the American Civil Liberties Union has filed suit to have all military cross-shaped headstones removed.
 
We couldn't find any news stories or court cases to support such a claim.
 
We asked the ACLU if they had filed such a suit. No way, said spokesman Will Matthews.
 
""The ACLU has never once advocated for or initiated any litigation in favor of, removing cross-shaped headstones from federal cemeteries,"" he said in an e-mail.
 
For good measure, he added the ACLU has also not filed suit to stop voluntary prayer in the military, either.
 
Not content with the ACLU's denial, we went to the National Cemetery Administration of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. They are responsible for maintaining the national cemeteries and issuing headstones and markers for deceased military veterans.
 
""To begin with, we don't have cross-shaped headstones at VA national cemeteries,"" said spokesman Michael Nacincik. The headstones and markers the government issues are rectangular.
 
He also said there was no lawsuit concerning headstones.
 
Family members of the deceased can select an emblem of religious belief to be inscribed on the headstone or marker. Currently, there are

39 different emblems

from which to choose. The symbols include different types of crosses, the star of David, the Muslim crescent and star, the Buddhist Wheel of Righteousness, and many others, including symbols for atheists and secular humanists.
 
""Many people choose to have a Christian cross inscribed, but people can choose other symbols, or no symbol at all,"" Nacincik said.
 
""We're not going to be removing emblems of belief that people have chosen,"" he added.
 
Those emblems are the closest we could find to the origin of this claim: In 2006, the ACLU helped the families of three deceased veterans sue the National Cemetery Administration to add the Wiccan symbol, a pentagram, to the list of approved emblems. The administration did end up adding the symbol.
 
Believe it or not, we still didn't feel we had exhausted every avenue here, because hadn't we seen photos before of military cemeteries with

rows of crosses

? It turns out these cemeteries are mostly in Europe, the final resting place for some of the American troops killed during World War I and World War II. The cemeteries are maintained by the American Battle Monuments Commission, an agency of the executive branch established in 1923.
 
""I'm not aware of any efforts to remove cross-shaped headstones at our site,"" said Thomas Sole, director of engineering for the commission.
 
Generally speaking, the cemeteries are located at the sites of battles where many troops died. Families had the choice of having the remains repatriated to the United States or being buried overseas.
 
The graves in these cemeteries are marked with crosses or, if the deceased were Jewish, with stars of David, Sole said. The graves of deceased who were neither Christian nor Jewish also are marked by crosses.
 
In the immediate aftermath of a battle, troops would bury their fallen and mark the graves with wooden crosses. ""Our marble crosses are a reflection of those temporary wooden crosses,"" Sole said.
 
Technically, the cemeteries are owned by the foreign country in which they are located, but the land is ""given to the U.S. for use in perpetuity as commemorative cemeteries,"" Sole said. The cemeteries are closed to new interments, even to veterans, except for the remains of any servicemen and women lost during the World Wars that may be found on the battlefields.
 
But just to repeat, Sole said he didn't know about any lawsuits to remove the crosses.
 
So to sum up, the ACLU said it was not suing over that. (""The ACLU believes very deeply in the cherished value of religious freedom, and the right of all Americans to practice the religion of their choosing — or to practice no religion at all — freely and without fear or compulsion,"" Matthews said.) The U.S. Department of Veterans doesn't know about any lawsuit. And the American Battle Monuments Commission said there is no lawsuit. So we rate this statement Pants on Fire!

"['Environment', 'National', 'Climate Change', 'Energy', 'Chuck Grassley']","
Claims that U.S. will only reduce carbon emissions by 1 percent unless others help
","Shortly after the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill, some Republicans made this claim about the plan: Lowering carbon emissions in the United States will do little to slow climate change unless other countries do the same.

The GOP's position is that putting a cap on carbon dioxide emissions will be too costly for businesses and for consumers, and if the United States is going it alone those costs outweigh the environmental benefit.

Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, who has been one of the more vocal skeptics, made this argument on June 28, 2009, on  This Week with George Stephanopoulos. 

""If the United States moves ahead by itself (on cap-and-trade) ... after 30 or 40 years, we're going to reduce CO2 by less than 1 percent,"" he said.

He reiterated his opinion during a conference call with reporters on July 1, 2009, saying, ""If the United States would go ahead — because we're supposed to so-called set an example for the rest of the world — and if the rest of the world doesn't go along, then we're turning out to be suckers because we're — we're going to just reduce total CO2 by a spit in the ocean by ourselves.""

We wondered whether our cap-and-trade plan could be as limited as Grassley maintains — or at least whether Grassley's 1 percent prediction is even close.

Before digging into his claim, here's a little background on this complicated issue, one we've  already   explored  in terms of how much it  might cost  consumers. The bill, authored by Democratic Reps. Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, was approved by the House of Representatives on June 26, and would essentially limit the amount of carbon dioxide companies can emit each year. The cap will become tighter and tighter over time, and ultimately, lawmakers say their plan will reduce carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020, and 83 percent by 2050.

Of course, those big reductions apply only to carbon emissions produced in the United States. Cap-and-trade opponents say it's foolhardy for the United States to move forward without some indication that other countries will adopt similar restrictions. But the European Union already has agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020. And in July, members of the Group of Eight are expected to hammer out a deal on global emissions reductions.

Of greatest concern remains China, a country that has recently become the world's biggest producer of greenhouse gases. According to the Energy Information Administration, a government-run database of energy statistics, the United States contributed about 5,907 million metric tons in 2006 — or about 20 percent of the world's total. In the same year, China surpassed that amount by about 100 million metric tons, becoming the leading contributor to global warming.

New York Times  columnist Paul Krugman pointed out exactly this problem in a May 14 op-ed about China's economic development.

""China cannot continue along its current path because the planet can’t handle the strain,"" he wrote. ""The scientific consensus on prospects for global warming has become much more pessimistic over the last few years. Indeed, the latest projections from reputable climate scientists border on the apocalyptic. Why? Because the rate at which greenhouse gas emissions are rising is matching or exceeding the worst-case scenarios. And the growth of emissions from China — already the world’s largest producer of carbon dioxide — is one main reason for this new pessimism.""

The Pew Center on Global Climate Change, an organization that produces analysis on climate issues, had this to say: ""Climate change is a global problem and will require nations of the world to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is true that the United States has recently been overtaken by China as the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, but the United States still contributes 20 percent of global emissions, so what we do is critically important. It is also true that if the United States acts alone, we cannot solve climate change.""

And Harvard economics professor Martin Feldstein offered some numbers to back up a similar opinion:

""Since the U.S. share of global CO2 production is now less than 25 percent (and is projected to decline as China and other developing nations grow), a 15 percent fall in U.S. CO2 output would lower global CO2 output by less than 4 percent,"" he wrote in a June 1  Washington Post  op-ed. ""Its impact on global warming would be virtually unnoticeable. The U.S. should wait until there is a global agreement on CO2 that includes China and India before committing to costly reductions in the United States.""

Less than 4 percent is close to what Grassley said, but we wanted to see some real data. So, we turned to a memo produced by two professors at Duke University's Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions who concluded that, ""the success of (Waxman-Markey) depends on whether other nations also pursue equivalent reductions.""

To illustrate their point, professors Tim Profeta and Prasad Kasibhatla plotted three possible scenarios using this handy  modeling system  (yes, you can  play along  , too). In the first, most developed countries — including the United States and some European nations — adopt something similar to Waxman-Markey, but developing countries do not; in the second, developing nations reduce emissions as well; and in the third, developing nations delay a reduction in their emissions, but eventually participate.

Their work shows that, under the first scenario, there would actually be a steady increase in carbon emissions, while under the other two scenarios — where developed countries pitch in — carbon emissions would decline over time.

So, Grassley's prediction is right — sort of, said Profeta.

""It's true that if the U.S. acts solo, we will see little impact,"" he said, adding that he's not sure where Grassley got his ""1 percent"" prediction. ""But that's a very unlikely assumption.""

We're more likely to see something along the lines of scenario three, he said, where China will adopt cap-and-trade at a later date, when its per capita carbon emissions equal those from developed countries.

We posed a similar question to Mark Radka with the United Nations Environment Program via e-mail.

""With no one else doing anything other than growing — a lot — and the U.S. singlehandedly reducing emissions along a not so aggressive path you might come up with a number like 1 percent,"" he wrote.  ""This would be one of those absurd baseline scenarios that really doesn’t represent a baseline in any other than a theoretical sense.""

And Alden Meyer with the Union of Concerned Scientists said it's a myth that China's doing nothing, pointing out that the country has embraced renewable technologies and set fuel economy standards that are arguably more stringent than those  announced  by the Obama administration earlier this year. ""You could say it's a drop in the bucket, but that could be said for any country,"" Meyer added. ""The risk of not adopting Waxman-Markey is that we give China the excuse to say, 'Why should we do it if the wealthiest country isn't doing it?'"" So where does that leave us? The experts we spoke with all agree that our impact on climate change will be relatively small without the involvement of other countries, particularly China. On this point, Grassley is correct. But, those same experts say it's highly unlikely that we would be the only nation limiting our carbon emissions in the coming decades. In fact, Grassley's statement is misleading in this regard because Europe already has adopted stricter goals than the targets we're considering, and China is taking other steps to reduce carbon production. As for Grassley's prediction that our cap-and-trade bill alone would only reduce climate change emissions by 1 percent, things are still murky. His office did not return calls or e-mails to back up that claim, our experts had never heard the statistic before, nor could we find any studies or documents to support it. The only number we've got comes from an opinion article written by a Harvard economist, who says 4 percent, which is in the Grassley ballpark.

E-mail claims Free Flow of Information Act would protect Obama from having to produce birth certificate
","
Who knows where some political ideas originate. 
Any anonymous person can post a statement on the Internet. It can be passed around, repeated, added to and commented on in blog after blog. It can be circulated in chain e-mails. And pretty soon it gathers such steam, its very reach seems to add credibility. 
Here, we deal with just such an idea. It's the claim that the Free Flow of Information Act of 2009 passed by the House in March is actually a ""stealth"" law aimed at protecting President Barack Obama from having to produce his ""actual"" birth certificate. That's why some conservative bloggers derisively call it the ""Obama Birth Certificate Protection Act."" 
Readers sent us an e-mail that claimed the bill ""would guarantee Barack Obama will never be held accountable for producing forged birth documents."" Most versions call for readers to contact their local legislator to oppose the bill, which has been introduced in the Senate. 
As for the claim that Obama produced ""forged"" birth documents, that's a matter we have been following for quite some time, and we direct your attention  here  . 
In this item, we wanted to set the record straight about the Free Flow of Information Act. Passed by the House in March, the bill is designed to protect journalists from having to reveal confidential sources in federal court. 
Here's what the bill says: ""A federal entity may not compel a covered person to provide testimony or produce any document related to information obtained or created by such covered person as part of engaging in journalism, unless a court determines by a preponderance of the evidence."" You can read the bill in its entirety  here  . 
Many bloggers insist it would also protect federal employees of the executive branch from being compelled to release documents. 
But the key words are ""covered person."" And this is how it's defined later in the bill: ""The term 'covered person' means a person who regularly gathers, prepares, collects, photographs, records, writes, edits, reports, or publishes news or information that concerns local, national, or international events or other matters of public interest for dissemination to the public for a substantial portion of the person's livelihood or for substantial financial gain and includes a supervisor, employer, parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of such covered person."" 
In other words, ""a covered person is simply a journalist,"" said Sophia Cope, legislative counsel for the Newspaper Association of America, which has lobbied hard for the bill. ""The White House would not fall under that."" 
This bill has been kicking around Congress for four years, long before Obama announced his candidacy for president. The  idea that it is a covert attempt to block Obama from producing his birth certificate is absurd. We also note that the bill has enjoyed widespread bipartisan support. It was so noncontroversial it passed the House on March 31 with a voice vote rather than a roll call. Last Congress, it passed by a vote of 398-21. A Senate version of the bill is under consideration. 
Cope isn't quite sure how the intent of the law has been so grossly distorted. 
""The bill's intent is to protect reporters and their confidential sources from being subpoenaed to testify, or from having to disclose the identity of those sources,"" Cope said. ""I don't see how it would relate to Obama's birth certificate."" 
One could argue that this law has simply been misread by some well-intentioned government watchdogs. But this is just the latest conspiracy theory from the fringe of a conservative group convinced that Obama hasn't provided sufficient documentation to prove he was born in the United States, and therefore cannot serve as president. Even among these folks, the claim about the Free Flow of Information Act is more than a stretch. We give it a Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8DEA00>],/factchecks/2009/jul/01/chain-email/e-mail-claims-free-flow-information-act-would-prot/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Lamar Smith']","
 ABC and broadcast networks steer clear of controversial issue ads
","
Rep. Lamar Smith was outraged that ABC News was dedicating a day of coverage to health care reform, capping it off with an exclusive town hall with President Barack Obama.
 
""It was like a rigged football game,"" Smith told Greta Van Susteren during an interview on Fox News. ""The president had home field advantage. ABC was the only referee. The opposing team wasn't allowed on the field. But ABC didn't even allow ads that opposed the president's health care plan to be aired.""
 
Smith, a Republican from Texas, made his comments even before the special aired on June 24, 2009. We wanted to know if it was true that ABC ""didn't even allow ads that opposed the president's health care plan to be aired.""
 
A call to ABC confirmed that this was true. Though ABC accepts advertising for political candidates, it has a policy of rejecting ads that advocate for general political issues, a spokeswoman told us. We tried to ask more detailed questions about the policy, but she wouldn't talk about specifics.
 
We were able to find several news reports about ABC rejecting other ads over the years, including ads that opposed the oil industry and the Iraq war.
 
Adding another wrinkle, local ABC affiliates set their own standards to sell ads. Naturally, viewers at home have no way of knowing if the ad was sold by the local affiliate or the parent network.
 
Smith complained after the advocacy group Conservatives for Patients' Rights tried and failed to buy ads during the president's town hall. The group is opposed to Democratic plans for  the health care system because they say it would create a socialized medical system similar to Canada's or Britain's. (We examined one of their ads back in April and rated a claim about health effectiveness research as

Barely True

.)
 
Conservatives for Patients' Rights disputed ABC's claim that it did not accept advocacy ads. In a letter to ABC, the group cited a report from TNS Media Intelligence, a respected independent media firm, that showed ad buys by T. Boone Pickens, who argues for energy independence, and the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which promotes fiscal responsibility.
 
We asked Andrew Tyndall, who monitors the major network news programs at his Web site the Tyndall Report, about advocacy ads appearing on the networks. He said it's true that ABC and the other major networks forbid issue advocacy ads, but there is a gray area: The networks will accept public-interest ads from lobbying groups that are generally positive in tone and message. These types of ads usually air during the Sunday morning shows, he said.
 
""You can't address matters of public controversy in those. You can only burnish your image,"" Tyndall said.
 
In theory, if Conservatives for Patients' Rights had designed an ad that talked about how wonderful the private insurance system is, that might have passed muster with ABC. ""You can say the good part, but not the bad part,"" Tyndall concluded.
 
The network's rules are internal standards that are holdovers from the days when broadcast networks were more closely regulated, Tyndall said.
 
In fact, advocacy ads usually air on local affiliates and cable channels, and there are several reasons for this, said Evan Tracey, president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group that is part of TNS Media Intelligence.
 
On cable news channels, advertisers feel like they're reaching a demographic that includes news junkies and policymakers. When Congress is in session, advocacy groups will buy time with affiliates in Washington, D.C. That advertising follows members of Congress home to local affiliates during the breaks, especially if the member is a swing vote or chairs a committee with jurisdiction over a particular issue.
 
The handful of national networks, though, just want to avoid controversy.
 
""By and large, historically, they've stayed away from this stuff as much as possible, though no one is 100 percent pure,"" Tracey said. ""There's probably stuff they've taken in the past where the salespeople said, 'This isn't very controversial,' and so they took it.""
 
In this case, things may have worked out well for both sides, Tracey said. ""ABC is probably happy they didn't take the spot, and Conservatives for Patients' Rights is just as happy because they didn't have to pay for it, and they still get their publicity.""
 
The congressman is right, though. He said, ""ABC didn't even allow ads that opposed the president's health care plan to be aired."" Groups who opposed Obama's plan tried to buy advertising during his town hall meeting and were turned down. Even ABC said that was the case. We rate Smith's statement True.

"['National', 'Consumer Safety', 'George Will']","
Claims that smoking kills more people annually than other dangerous activities combined
","Congress recently gave the Food and Drug Administration the ability to regulate tobacco, and George Will is not impressed.

He said the new law is flawed because it restricts advertising (new rules could ""merit a constitutional challenge""), because it is supported by the tobacco industry (""a crystalline example of Washington business as usual"") and because it it perpetuates what Will calls a government ""addiction to tobacco tax revenue.""

""The February expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program is supposed to be financed by increased tobacco taxes, so this health care depends on an ample and renewable supply of smokers,"" he wrote in a June 18, 2009,  Washington Post  column. Governments will never outlaw smoking because ""governments cannot loot tobacco companies that do not flourish.""

Will thinks the new law is no good, but he's certainly no fan of smoking either, and he made this claim to demonstrate his aversion to the habit:

""Three decades ago, public outrage killed an automobile model (Ford's Pinto) whose design defects allegedly caused 59 deaths,"" he wrote. ""Yet every year tobacco kills more Americans than did World War II — more than AIDS, cocaine, heroin, alcohol, vehicular accidents, homicide and suicide combined.""

More than AIDS? More than car accidents? We were skeptical, so we decided to take a look ourselves.

It seems that Will plucked part of his claim from the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a leading advocate for the new law. According to the organization, about 400,000 people die from their own smoking each year, and about 50,000 die from second-hand smoke annually. And according to the group's Web site, ""Smoking kills more people than alcohol, AIDS, car accidents, illegal drugs, murders and suicides combined.""

Even though that fact is repeated by many antismoking campaigns, and by the American Cancer Society, we decided to crunch the numbers ourselves. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2006, when their database was last updated, 22,073 people died of alcohol, 12,113 died of AIDS, 43,664 died of car accidents, 38,396 died of drug use — legal and illegal — 18,573 died of murder and 33,300 died of suicide.

That brings us to a total of 168,119 deaths, far less than the 450,000 that die from smoking annually.

As for the part about World War II, Will came up with this comparison himself. About 292,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines were killed in battle during World War II, according to a U.S. Census Bureau April 29, 2004, report in commemoration of the new World War II memorial in Washington, D.C. An additional 114,000 members of U.S. forces died of other causes during the war, bringing the total to 406,000 people.

Will's claim — that smoking kills more people annually than in World War II or from other dangerous diseases and habits — holds up with the CDC and the Census Bureau. As a result, we give Will a True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC49AC0>],/factchecks/2009/jun/29/george-will/claims-smoking-kills-more-people-annually-other-da/

Michele Bachmann claims ACORN getting money to work for Census Bureau
","
Rep. Michele Bachmann sparked a new controversy recently when she declared she would provide the bare minimum to Census takers because she was concerned about the Census Bureau's partnership with ACORN, a left-leaning group that has become a popular villain for Republicans.
 
(You remember ACORN: Formally known as the Association of Community Organization for Reform Now, it was lambasted in 2008 by many Republicans because its voter registration efforts included some fraudulent names such as Mickey Mouse. ACORN leaders said they discovered the fake names, notified authorities and fired some workers who cut corners. But Republican leaders still say it was a willful effort to manipulate the election to help the group's liberal agenda.)
 
Here's how Bachmann explained her concerns in a

Washington Times

interview (which you can listen to

here

):
 
""Now ACORN has been named one of the national partners, which will be a recipient again of federal money,"" Bachmann said. ""And they will be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public. This is very concerning because the motherload of all data information will be from the Census. And, of course, we think of the Census as just counting how many people live in your home. Unfortunately, the Census data has become very intricate, very personal (with) a lot of the questions that are asked.
 
""And I know for my family the only question that we will be answering is how many people are in our home. We won't be answering any information beyond that, because the Constitution doesn't require any information beyond that.""
 
Bachmann packs a lot of bad information into a short space there. So in this item we'll deal with her latest claim about ACORN, and we'll deal with her claim about the constitutional requirement with

a different item

.
 
She is wildly wrong with her chraracterization of the Census Bureau's partnership program. Yes, the bureau

does

partner with organizations to help recruit workers. To date, it has 30,000 such partners.
 
ACORN is one.
 
Partners agree ""to promote the 2010 Census among their constituents."" As a partner, ACORN has agreed to spread the word among its people about the availability of temporary Census jobs. The U.S. Census Bureau expects to hire 1.4 million people through the course of the 2010 census, the bulk of them to do the door-to-door questionnaires, so the bureau casts a wide net to get applicants, including through its partners. Partners don't get paid, but they presumably benefit by getting the word out to members about jobs, and also by providing a public service emphasizing the importance of filling out the Census.
 
According to Census Bureau information provided to Congress on June 1, 2009, ""ACORN and other partner organizations simply promote the availability of temporary Census jobs, but have no role in the terms or conditions of employment beyond promotion of the availability of temporary jobs. Applicants that are hired by the Census Bureau to work on the 2010 Census are required to go through a background check that includes an FBI name check and fingerprint check so that felons are not hired to work on the 2010 Census.""
 
Partners are also encouraged to donate testing space for the millions of people who will apply for the temporary Census jobs. No payments are made for that. And lastly, partners are asked to promote full participation in the Census among their members, through newsletters, e-mails, local meetings etc. Again, there's no payment for that.
 
So let's count the ways Bachmann is wrong:
 
ACORN will not be ""in charge"" of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public, as Bachmann said. The U.S. Census will be in charge of that. Some of the 1.4 million people who get Census-taking jobs may learn about the job through ACORN. Workers who apply to the Census through ACORN have no better shot at the job than those who apply through any of the 30,000 other partners. That's it.
 
And despite Bachmann's claim, ACORN gets no money for signing on as a partner.
 
Once again, she is making a scaremongering claim about ACORN with facts that are ridiculously wrong. So we have to set the meter on fire once again. She earns another Pants on Fire.

Michele Bachmann claims Constitution only requires you to answer how many people are in your household
","
U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., is no stranger to the Truth-O-Meter. So far, her comments have decidedly bent the needle to the left and, on one occasion, set the meter on fire. 
We swear we're not trying to pick on her, but we just couldn't let this latest one go. Recently, Bachmann went on record to declare that because of ACORN's involvement in the Census and other privacy concerns, she would only tell 2010 Census takers how many people are in her household — and nothing more. 
Here's how she explained it in a  Washington Times  interview (which you can listen to  here  ): 
""Now ACORN has been named one of the national partners, which will be a recipient again of federal money,"" Bachmann said. ""And they will be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public. This is very concerning because the motherload of all data information will be from the Census. And, of course, we think of the Census as just counting how many people live in your home. Unfortunately, the Census data has become very intricate, very personal (with) a lot of the questions that are asked. 
""And I know for my family the only question that we will be answering is how many people are in our home. We won't be answering any information beyond that, because the Constitution doesn't require any information beyond that."" 
There's a lot wrong in her statement, so we divided it into two Truth-O-Meter items. You can read the one on ACORN's involvement  in a different item  . In this item, we'll address Bachmann's claim that she's only constitutionally obligated to provide the number of people in her household. 
Here's what the Constitution actually says: 
""Representation and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this Union, according to their respective numbers ... the actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct."" 
So the Constitution itself does not contain any requirement, as Bachmann claims. 
We draw your attention to the last clause, ""in such a manner as they shall by law direct."" The ""they"" in that sentence refers to members of Congress. They write laws about the content of the Census and require that people answer the questions. 
Even the very first census in 1790 included more than just the question of how many people lived in the household. According to a Census Bureau spokeswoman, the 1790 Census specifically asked about the number of free white males age 16 and over in order to assess the country’s military and industrial potential. That first Census also asked for the race and gender of household residents, and whether they were free or enslaved. 
Subsequent Census Acts expanded the number of questions exponentially. 
According to Census spokeswoman Stacy Gimbel, these laws came under the authority of the ""Necessary and Proper"" clause of the Constitution:

""The Congress shall have the power . . . To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof."" 
Congress' use of the Census to ask questions well beyond just the number of people has been upheld several times by the Supreme Court, Gimbel said, citing several cases. 
What's more, a law passed by Congress  requires  people to answer ""any of the questions on any schedule submitted to him in connection with any Census"" from the U.S. Census. 
So what if you don't? 
The law says those who refuse to fill out the entirety of their Census questionnaire or answer questions posed by Census takers could face fines of anywhere from $100 to $500. Honestly, Gimbel said, the U.S. Census doesn't often enforce those rules. 
""It is important to note that Census takers are not seeking to prosecute people; our goal is to gather and return to the public quality information that assures equal representation and determines how billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money is spent by their government,"" Gimbel said. 
Bachmann's claims that the Constitution only requires people to say how many people live in their household is ""completely baseless,"" Gimbel said. 
Bachmann stuck to her misguided guns in a Fox interview on June 25, this time backing up her concerns about privacy by noting that in the 1940s the Census Bureau handed over information used to round up Japanese people and put them in internment camps. 
""I'm not saying that that's what the administration is planning to do,"" Bachmann said, ""but I am saying that private personal information that was given to the Census Bureau in the 1940s was used against Americans to round them up, in a violation of their constitutional rights, and put the Japanese in internment camps. I am just not comfortable with the way this census is being handled, with associating with ACORN, with the questions that are being asked, with Americans being compelled to give this information. How will this be cross-checked? Will it be held privately?"" 
Bachmann is right about how the Census was used to identify Japanese-Americans in the 1940s. Since then, however, Congress has passed laws to specifically protect the information it collects. Census employees take those privacy laws very seriously, she said. Employees found to have violated laws to protect people's personal identity face up to five years in jail and fines of up to $250,000. 
Bachmann is not only wrong here, she is engaging in fearmongering that encourages people to break the law. And in doing so, she's falsely telling people that the Constitution would support them. In fact, the  Washington Times  reporter followed her answer by saying, ""Well, I'm going to take your hint then and that'll save me some time."" And so we feel it's necessary to rate this one Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC63B980>],/factchecks/2009/jun/25/michele-bachmann/michelle-bachmann-claims-constitution-only-require/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama says Medicare and Medicaid are largest deficit drivers. Yes, over the long term.
","
During a town hall on health care, an audience member asked President Barack Obama about the cost of health care reform, and whether the government could afford to do it.
 
Obama's answer was a variation on the sales pitch, Can you afford

not

to?
 
""I think it's a very legitimate question,"" Obama began. ""I guess that the first point I'd make is, if we don't do anything, costs are going to go out of control. Nobody disputes this. Medicare and Medicaid are the single biggest drivers of the federal deficit and the federal debt by a huge margin.""
 
If we don't do something soon to rein in health care costs, Obama said, Medicare and Medicaid ""will consume all of the federal budget.""
 
We decided to check his statement that ""Medicare and Medicaid are the single biggest drivers of the federal deficit and the federal debt by a huge margin.""
 
We consulted a number of experts, both left-leaning and right-leaning, and they agreed that over the long term, Medicare and Medicaid, along with Social Security — the programs popularly known as ""entitlements"" — will indeed overwhelm the federal budget and are the main drivers of the deficit. (Of the three programs, Medicare is the largest by a significant margin.)
 
But there's also some explaining to do about Obama's statement.
 
When he talks about Medicare and Medicaid driving the deficit, he's not talking about 2009. The 2009 deficit will be powered primarily by the economic downturn, both spending on stimulus and bailouts, and lost tax revenues from the lack of economic activity. The Bush tax cuts, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the recent Medicare prescription drug benefit have also created gaps between spending and revenues in recent years.
 
But Obama's singling out of Medicare and Medicaid is true over a much longer window of time, say, over the next 50 to 75 years.
 
Now, that may strike you — as it did us — as too far in the future to worry about. But the economists we spoke to are definitely worried about it right now.
 
A coalition of diverse think tanks — the Concord Coalition, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, the Brookings Institution, the Heritage Foundation — teamed up several years ago for a ""Fiscal Wake Up Tour"" to alert people across the political spectrum about the poor outlook for the budget over the long term.
 
""Unless lawmakers promptly reform Social Secu­rity, Medicare, and Medicaid, America faces a future of soaring taxes and government spending that will cause poor economic performance,"" wrote Brian Riedl, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, who participated in the tour.
 
""Americans will pay onerous taxes, and future generations will have lower living standards than Americans enjoy today,"" he said. ""The longer lawmakers wait to enact the necessary reforms, the more painful those reforms will be.""
 
How bad could things get? The nonpartisan Concord Coalition, citing data models from the Government Accountability Office, found that by 2027, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and net interest would consume all revenues collected by the federal government. By 2047, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid alone would consume all revenues. By 2052, the model is untenable, because the economy is in ruins.

Gulp!

 
So if Obama is right that Medicare and Medicaid are driving the deficit, then health care reform can fix the long-term deficit, right?
 
Wrong.
 
""We have to do everything we can on the health care side, and then certainly there's going to be even more that we have to do,"" said James Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. ""Don't assume we can wave the wand on health care reform and that will take care of everything.""
 
Obama has said many times that he wants health care reform to slow the growth of health care spending. But note the words slow the

growth 

— that doesn't mean a reduction in overall health care spending.
 
""Even if we significantly cut back the growth in health spending every year for the next 75 years, we still need more revenues to pay for our current obligations,"" said Ben Harris, a senior research associate at Brookings and the Tax Policy Center. ""There's a need for a dramatic cut in spending or some way to raise more revenue, whether it's a new tax or raising an existing tax.""
 
That's where the economists disagree: Whether to cut spending or raise taxes. But we found little disagreement over the underlying problem.
 
So going back to Obama's statement, Obama said, ""Medicare and Medicaid are the single biggest drivers of the federal deficit and the federal debt by a huge margin."" But we do need to add the caveat that Medicare and Medicaid growth is a long-term problem, not what's driving the deficits of this year or the next few years. We rate his statement Mostly True.

Claims that the CBO predicts cap-and-trade will cost about as much as a stamp a day
","
Responding to Republicans who have said a cap-and-trade bill could cost thousands of dollars a year for the average family, the Democratic sponsors of the bill are citing a new study from the Congressional Budget Office that they say shows their plan will be affordable.

 

""For the cost of about a postage stamp a day, all American families will see a return on their investment as our nation breaks our dependence on foreign oil, cuts dangerous carbon pollution and creates millions of new clean-energy jobs that can't be shipped overseas,"" Rep. Edward Markey said in a June 22, 2009, news release jointly issued with the co-sponsor, Rep. Henry Waxman.


Waxman and Markey, from California and Massachusetts respectively, are the authors of a bill that would set up a market for power companies and other polluters to buy and trade carbon credits. The goal is to force them to cut their harmful emissions and lower carbon pollution 83 percent by 2050. But critics say polluters will inevitably pass the cost of buying credits or cleaner technologies on to the consumer. 


Putting a price tag on such a complex plan is tricky and controversial, as we note in our article

Your Guide to the Cap-and-Trade Estimates

. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, says that cap-and-trade could raise the average family's annual energy bill by $1,241. House Republicans have said that cap-and-trade could cost consumers up to $3,100, a figure they say came from a Massachusetts Institute of Technology report. But the writers of that report admonished the GOP for incorrectly interpreting their work; intially, the authors predicted it would cost consumers about $340 annually, and have since updated that estimate to $800.


Waxman and Markey are relying on a June 19 Congressional Budget Office analysis of their bill. The CBO is a well-respected, independent arm of Congress, but we have found its findings are occasionally mischaracterized by members of Congress. So we wanted to check whether Waxman is correctly summarizing the CBO's findings.


Indeed, the report cited by Markey and Waxman predicts the bill would have a net annual economywide cost of $22 billion — or about $175 per household — in 2020. Divide that number by 365 days, and you get about 48 cents. A first-class stamp costs 44 cents, so Waxman is close.


The CBO's estimate includes several assumptions about important decisions that still must be made by Congress, such as how much energy companies will pay to buy and trade polluting credits. But it's worth reading the fine print on this one, because CBO notes that the actual cost per family will vary depending on income. For example, low-income consumers could expect to save $40 a year, while wealthy people will see a net increase for energy costs of $235 to $340 every year. And the analysis does not include the costs or benefits of other parts of the bill, such as government efforts to quickly develop new technology, wrote CBO director Douglas Elmendorf in a June 20 blog post.


It's also important to note that the costs will vary year to year. As the bill stands, polluting allowances will initially be given away for free. But by 2035, about 70 percent of those allocations will be sold by the government. Supporters of the bill say federal revenue from the program would be used to pay for tax credits and rebates for the middle class. 


CBO chose 2020 as a milestone for its analysis because it's a point at which the program would have been in effect for eight years, giving the economy and polluters time to adjust. But had CBO chosen a later date, the cost per family may have been higher because the government would gradually be charging polluters more.


Waxman and Markey are clear about these variables and omissions in their press statement. They note that the poorest people will gain from the bill, and point out that the study does not include every element that could contribute to cap-and-trade's cost.


But critics are more skeptical of the report. By not including all variables, the CBO report ""grossly underestimates costs of cap-and-trade,"" said a memo from the Heritage Foundation, which has published many articles opposing the proposal. Among other things, Heritage says the study is flawed because it doesn't address economic changes resulting from restricted energy use and potential job losses.


For this Truth-O-Meter item, we are not addressing which study is best, but focusing on whether Markey correctly described the CBO's findings. He was close — off by just 4 cents — and he indicated it was an approximation because he said ""about a postage stamp a day."" So we find the statement True.

Limbaugh: 'Polar vortex' is made up, yet still proof the ice caps aren't melting
","Those images of polar bears stranded atop tiny glaciers, looking very sad about their melting home in the North Pole, are phony, says radio host Rush Limbaugh.

The ""polar vortex"" chilling much of the country with record low temperatures (though not really colder ones than on Mars). The media is playing it up as an extreme, counterintuitive consequence of a warming planet as part of its global warming ""hoax,"" Limbaugh said, when the polar blast really proves just the opposite. ""We are having a record-breaking cold snap in many parts of the country,"" he said during his Jan. 6 show. ""And right on schedule the media have to come up with a way to make it sound like it’s completely unprecedented. Because they’ve got to find a way to attach this to the global warming agenda, and they have. It’s called the ‘polar vortex.’ The dreaded polar vortex."" ""Do you know what the polar vortex is? Have you ever heard of it? Well, they just created it for this week."" Here’s part of how he broke it down for his audience: ""See, normally the polar vortex stays up there in the polar region, but something is causing it to dip down like it's never happened before. We've never had arctic air blasts before. And remember, now, the key to all this is you have to understand one of the fundamental concepts of man-made global warming is ice melting at the poles. ""One of the ways they have always sought to convince you that the world is warming is not the climate where you live, but rather where you aren't, where you can't see what is really happening. So they tell you the ice is melting at the North Pole and the South Pole. And then they publish pictures, which are fraudulent pictures, of poor little polar bears stranded on three square feet of ice that you are told used to be the North Pole. ""... Well, obviously there is no melting of ice going on at the North Pole. If they're gonna tell us the polar vortex is responsible for this cold, that means record cold is also happening in the North Pole, which means there isn't any ice melting."" We’ve heard several political commentators, errantly, call into question the validity of global warming given the week’s record-breaking low temperatures. Limbaugh takes it further, dubious of both global warming and the polar vortex itself. PunditFact wanted to know: Does the unusual blast of cool air, which he says the media ginned up as the ""dreaded polar vortex,"" disprove global warming? ""Polar vortex"" may sound new to Limbaugh, journalists and anyone who is not a weather expert, but it’s not a term the media cooked up to scare you. It’s been part of the conversation in meteorology circles since at least the 1940s and ‘50s, experts told us. The polar vortex is the region in the northern hemisphere that contains the planet’s cold or Arctic air. A warmer atmosphere lies outside of the vortex. The boundary between the regions is a jet stream of strong, fast-moving, frigid winds. Sometimes the jet stream is more symmetrical, encircling the polar region in an oval without many bumps. Other times, especially this week, its rotation breaks off into deep troughs, ushering cold air to the south. A polar outbreak occurs in areas that have big drops in temperature, where the polar vortex has dipped pronouncedly south. This jet stream has become more wavy in the last five years, sending more cold air to the eastern U.S. and eastern Asia, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""It has been with us for eons,"" said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado-Boulder. ""It will be with us for eons to come."" Now, whether this week’s polar outbreak is a result of global warming is a matter of active scientific debate. Rutgers University climate researcher Jennifer Francis co-authored a 2012 research paper arguing the loss of Arctic ice leads to more extremes -- not just more frigid winters for the east coast, but also record warm temperatures in Alaska, record drought in California, storms in the United Kingdom, and a warm winter for Scandinavia. ""This sort of jet stream pattern is what we expect to occur more often as the Arctic continues to warm faster than the rest of the globe in response to increasing greenhouse gases,"" she said. ""We can't say this particular event is caused by climate change, but it is becoming clearer that this sort of pattern should become more likely in the future."" On his show, Limbaugh skewered a Daily Beast article with the headline ""Thank Global Warming for Freezing You Right Now,"" but the article actually couches the connection more than its flashy headline suggests: ""As crazy as it sounds, global warming may be at least partly to blame. This particular aspect of climate change science is not yet definitive, but here's what may be going on."" Serreze says it is too early to tell whether one-time weather events like this polar outbreak are happening as a result of global warming. That said, the polar outbreak definitely does not disprove that Arctic sea ice is not melting, as Limbaugh concludes. Sea ice at the North Pole is obviously not melting right this second. That’s because it’s January, and the pole is in darkness all day and night. But Arctic sea ice is almost at a record low for this time of year, Francis pointed out, even though it is up from 2012, the record low year. Scientists look at long-term trends, not annual shifts, to base their conclusions. Alarm over shrinking sea ice is based on how the region is shedding more and more of it by the end of summer -- as less ice covers the Arctic Ocean, the ocean absorbs more warmth. Historically, ice covering the Arctic sea is twice as big as the continental United States by winter’s end in March, Serreze said. As the ocean warms, ice melts. Around 1980, sea ice by summer’s end in September covered as much area as the contiguous United States, Serreze said. Lately, it’s shrunk to an area smaller than the size of the United States west of the Mississippi River. ""The long-term trend in Arctic sea ice is sharply downwards, and this trend has the capability to cause significant alterations in jet stream behavior that can cause an increase in both warm and cold extreme events in the winter,"" said Jeff Masters, director of meteorology at Weather Underground. Serreze labeled Limbaugh’s connection between the cold snap and sea ice as ""absurd."" Our ruling Limbaugh claimed the media made up the ""polar vortex"" to bolster global warming. What the cold snap does prove, he says, is Arctic sea ice is not melting -- that global warming is a hoax. Climate scientists told us his rant is wildly misinformed. The polar vortex has been a part of science for decades, and it certainly does not prove that sea ice is not melting.

"['Financial Regulation', 'Texas', 'Wendy Davis']","
Certain payday loans had effective interest rates of more than 1,000 percent for part of 2012
","Wendy Davis called for a Republican appointee’s head while maintaining that payday lenders sock consumers with extremely high charges. In a Dec. 30, 2013, press release, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate said William White, a Cash America International Inc. vice president, ""can’t protect Texas consumers while he represents a predatory lending company on the side."" White, an appointee of Gov. Rick Perry, has chaired the Texas Finance Commission, which oversees the state credit commissioner, since 2009. Davis piped up in reaction to White’s comments as quoted in a Dec. 29, 2013, El Paso Times news article stating. According to the story, White said that individuals who take payday loans are responsible for their decisions, not lenders. ""There's nobody out there that forces anybody to take any kind of loan,"" White said. Davis’ campaign press release noted that in 2011, Davis said: ""It’s really disgusting that an industry that profits from the poor by charging 1,000-plus interest is put at the head of the state’s financial regulatory agency. It’s saying, ‘It’s not only OK, but we’re going to put them in charge.’ "" It’s no secret that payday loans—the idea being that such loans are often being repaid from a future pay check—are costly. But 1,000-plus percent costly? Davis campaign back-up The same Jan. 20, 2011, story that initially quoted Davis making this claim, published in the liberal Texas Observer, preceded her comment by saying: ""Cash America and other payday lending companies advertise heavily on street corners in low-income neighborhoods and offer easy cash on the Internet to borrowers in financial crisis. These ‘easy’ loans carry jacked-up fees and exorbitant interest rates. In Texas, an eight-day payday loan carries a 1,153 percent annual rate—one of the highest in the nation,"" the story said. That story did not list a source for that declared rate. To our inquiry, a Davis campaign spokeswoman, Rebecca Acuña, emailed us published commentaries and research articles in support of the senator’s claim. One of the advocacy pieces led us to a March 18, 2013, report by Texans for Public Justice on lobbyists for the state’s ""runaway predatory lenders."" The report said: ""Although Texas prohibits usurious interest rates, companies dodge these protections by organizing as unregulated middlemen. So-called ‘credit service organizations’ link borrowers to lenders, who comply with state interest-rate caps. After the middlemen tag on exorbitant fees and arrange repeated rollovers, however, loans secured by paychecks or car titles can carry annual effective interest rates exceeding 1,000 percent."" National perspective We sought broader analyses. Nationally, according to ""fast facts"" about payday lenders as posted online by the Center for Responsible Lending, a North Carolina-based nonprofit that says it ""works to protect homeownership and family wealth by fighting predatory lending practices,"" the typical two-week payday loan has an effective annual interest rate ranging from 391 to 521 percent. Also, the center says, the typical payday borrower remains in loan debt for 212 days. ""Payday loans are small loans marketed as a quick, easy way to tide borrowers over until the next payday,"" the center says. ""However, the typical payday loan borrower is indebted for more than half of the year with an average of nine payday loan transactions at annual interest rates over 400%."" The center notes separately that Congress in 1968 came up with a way of gauging the full impact of such loans by imposing the APR, or Annual Percentage Rate of interest, ""as a standard measure that calculates the simple interest rate on an annual basis (including most fees), accounts for the amount of time the borrower has to repay the loan, and factors in the reduction in principal as payments are made over time. … The intent was to give consumers an accurate measure of the cost of the various credit options they might be considering, so that they need not pay unnecessarily high rates of interest or be caught in loans with hidden fees or arduous terms that make it more difficult to pay off the loan."" The Texas experience And what’s the deal in Texas? In telephone interviews, experts including a state administrator told us Texas state law restricts interest rates on consumer loans. However, payday loan fees are uncapped, which has enabled so-called middleman groups to charge the equivalent of hundreds of points of interest. And in 2012, some Texas payday loan rates exceeded 1,000 percent, according to a Feb. 18, 2013, presentation to the Texas House Pensions, Investments & Financial Services Committee by the Office of the Consumer Credit Commissioner. In each quarter of 2012, according to the presentation, there were more than 700,000 payday loans in the state—more than 80 percent of them for single-installment paybacks on which the effective annual rate rose from 446 percent in the first quarter of the year to 465 percent in the fourth quarter. More dramatically, the effective annual rate for multiple-installment loans spiked from 699 percent in the first quarter to 1,018 percent in the second quarter, falling to 900 percent in the third quarter and 513 percent in the fourth quarter, according to the presentation, though the related chart included a footnote warning of a ""low level of confidence in these figures due to suspected inaccurate, and unverifiable, reporting of average loan fees per $100 borrowed."" The presentation also included an agency leaflet, revised in December 2012, depicting payday loans as the most expensive way to borrow money while indicating related interest costs of 450 percent to 700 percent. By email, Rudy Aguilar, director of consumer protection for the Texas consumer credit commissioner, pointed out that one company, CashNetUSA, has declared online that its payday loans can result in borrowers facing an APR of 664 percent, while Fort Worth-based Cash America, Inc., has aired a 14-day APR on Texas payday loans of 533 percent. Aguilar also noted a declaration by Utah-based Check City that lists effective APRs of 271 percent to 1,124 percent and 1,151 percent depending on how long loans are taken out (35 days to as few as nine or eight days). By telephone, Aguilar said it’s his anecdotal impression that there are few instances of borrowers facing annual rates adding up to more than 1,000 percent. ""I have not seen a lot of loans with that type of APR. I’ve certainly seen (them) in the 500 to 700 percent range,"" Aguilar said. ""If you do run into a 1,000 or better APR, it’s going to be in the realm of the exception rather than the rule."" 'We know they exist' Proponents of restrictions on payday loan costs said there isn’t sufficient data to tell how many Texans have paid effective rates exceeding 1,000 percent. ""But we know they exist,"" analyst Ann Baddour of Texas Appleseed said by email. Also, she pointed out an online post by Ace Cash Express indicating it levies an effective rate of 918 percent (close to 1,000 percent) to repay a payday loan of $600 over five weeks. By email, Don Baylor of the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities pointed out its Sept. 18, 2013, report indicating that on average, Texans taking out single-installment payday loans in 2012 borrowed $468 over 19 days at an effective rate of 439 percent. Baylor said the center’s calculation is that some payday loans exceed 1,000 percent APR, while nearly half of single-payment payday loans exceed 500 percent APR. Our ruling Davis said payday lenders charge 1,000-plus percent interest. The effective annual rate of such loans in Texas, taking into account uncapped fees, can exceed 1,000 percent, but that’s not been common. For three months in 2012, the average effective annual rate for payday loans repaid in multiple installments exceeded 1,000 percent. Yet average effective rates for such loans were otherwise lower, while such rates for considerably more prevalent single-installment loans topped out at an average of 465 percent.

There are 3 unemployed people for every job opening, Obama adviser says
","About 1.3 million Americans rang in 2014 with a loss of long-term unemployment benefits, due to Congress’ failure to renew the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program before its Dec. 28 expiration. Gene Sperling, a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama and director of the National Economic Council, is pushing Congress to extend the benefits. The Senate passed a key procedural hurdle Tuesday, but the House is not considered likely to follow suit. To receive the benefits, the law requires that people actively look for jobs. On CNN’s State of the Union, Candy Crowley suggested that some people may be able to game the system. Sperling pushed back against that idea, emphasizing that a large majority of the unemployed are honestly trying to find jobs in a tough economy. ""Most of the people are desperately looking for jobs,"" he said. ""You know, our economy still has three people looking for every job (opening)."" We thought we’d check whether Sperling’s ratio of people to job openings is on target. To check the 3-to-1 ratio, we needed to know two things: the number of available jobs and the number of unemployed Americans. A White House spokesman referred us to a couple of Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. There were 3.925 million job openings in October, according to the BLS Job Openings and Labor Turnover report from Dec. 10. For an apples-to-apples comparison, we’ll use October unemployment numbers the BLS released in their Nov. 8 report, even though they’ve since published November data. They said 11.3 million people were unemployed. That just counts people who are actively looking for work, not those who have stopped looking due to discouragement or retirement. That’s a ratio of 2.88-to-1 or, once you round off, roughly 3-to-1, just as Sperling said. We should note a few caveats, though. Tara Sinclair, George Washington University economics professor, pointed out that Sperling’s ratio isn’t perfect. ""The numbers that Sperling reported are about correct, but there is actually a lot more competition for jobs than that because many employed people are also applying for the same jobs that the unemployed are applying for,"" she said. On the other hand, it’s worth noting that Sperling’s claim implies that for each job opening, there are three qualified applicants employers can choose from, but that’s a generous assumption. ""So it is possible for there to be a relatively high number of applicants for a job but employers may still feel like it is hard to hire because the people applying don't have the skills they are looking for,"" Sinclair said. ""Or people may not apply to the jobs that are out there because they are not a good fit for any number of reasons."" James Sherk, a senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said Sperling’s statistic is good for comparing change over time. For example, Sherk said, the economy is worse now than it was in 2006, though the ratio has been improving steadily as of late. Also worth noting is that many employers fill vacancies without publicizing them. According to one report, employers with no recorded vacancies at the end of a month account for 42 percent of hires in the next month. That means the number of job openings the BLS survey records will always understate the actual number of openings. Our ruling Sperling said that in today’s economy, there are three people looking for work per job available. We crunched BLS numbers and got the same ratio, as did economists. The BLS data has shortcomings, some that would make the ratio higher and some that would make it lower. It also might not accurately reflect what the climate looks like from the perspective of employers or job seekers. Still, these are minor quibbles. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7AFF80>],/factchecks/2014/jan/07/gene-sperling/there-are-3-unemployed-people-every-job-opening-ob/

Surveys find McAllen region most obese among large Texas metro areas
","Longtime state Sen. Eddie Lucio, D-Brownsville, highlighted two problems that come together in his district at the Southern Obesity Summit in Nashville, Tenn. Noting that Brownsville and McAllen are among the poorest cities in the U.S., Lucio said, ""Because higher rates of poverty are associated with poorer health care outcomes, it should come as no surprise that McAllen is also one of the most obese areas of the country,"" according to his prepared remarks for the opening session Nov. 17, 2013. ""Nearly 40 percent of my constituents there suffer,"" he said. Lucio cited via email an April 12, 2013, McAllen Monitor news story which said the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission region was ""the fattest metro area in the United States"" in 2012 based on a Gallup poll. He emailed us a link to the Gallup report released April 11, 2013, which drew on the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, an annual effort to analyze factors including social, financial and physical conditions of U.S. adults. Gallup used Hidalgo County as the boundary for the McAllen metropolitan statistical area. Only the southeastern part of Hidalgo County is in Lucio’s District 27, according to the Texas Legislative Council’s map, but we did not find a more precise breakdown of obesity statistics. By phone, Gallup-Healthways research director Dan Witters told us that the index uses information gathered nationwide in English and Spanish phone interviews. The survey reached about 350,000 U.S. adults throughout 2012 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 0.2 percentage points. Witters emailed us results for the nine largest Texas metropolitan statistical areas, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, where Gallup-Healthways was able to field 300 or more responses in 2012. Insufficient responses excluded Brownsville-Harlingen, which would have been ninth-largest out of the ten top MSAs. Of the nine regions, the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission metro area had the highest share of obese residents: 38.5 percent. Austin-Round Rock was the skinniest, at 22.7 percent.     Percentage of obese residents in nine of the 10 largest Texas MSAs for 2012, Gallup-Healthways: McAllen-Edinburg-Mission -- 38.5% Beaumont-Port Arthur -- 32.5% San Antonio -- 31.4% Corpus Christi -- 31.2% Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington -- 26.7% El Paso -- 26.7% Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown -- 26.6% Killeen-Temple-Fort Hood --  25.3% Austin-Round Rock -- 22.7% Nationally, Boulder, Colo., was Gallup-Healthways’ skinniest metropolitan statistical area with 12.5 percent obesity. The nationwide average was 26.2 percent. To calculate obesity, Witters said, Gallup-Healthways asked respondents for their height and weight, then calculated body-mass index, with a BMI of 30 or above considered obese. (To find yours, the National Institutes of Health say, ""Multiply your weight in pounds by 703. Divide that answer by your height in inches. Divide that answer by your height in inches again."" Or use an online calculator like these.) Witters said that In phone interviews, ""men tend to say they’re taller, women say they’re a bit lighter"" than they are. Gallup-Healthways did not modify its results to account for this, he said, but as a general rule of thumb adding 20 percent to 25 percent to BMI corrects for such self-reporting. Seeking another indicator of obesity in the McAllen region and elsewhere in Texas, we turned to the Texas Department of State Health Services. That agency defines the state’s metropolitan statistical areas differently than the federal government -- for example, splitting Dallas/Plano/Irving from Fort Worth/Arlington -- but like Gallup used Hidalgo County as the McAllen region. The McAllen area topped a 2012 list of large metro areas that spokeswoman Christine Mann gave us by phone. Percentage of obese residents in seven of the largest Texas MSAs for 2012, Department of State Health Services: McAllen-Edinburg-Pharr -- 44.7% El Paso MSA -- 34.1% Fort Worth-Arlington -- 31.8% San Antonio MSA -- 28.9% Houston-Baytown-Sugar Land -- 27% Dallas-Plano-Irving -- 26.5% Mann said the average for Texas in 2012 was 29.2 percent. Texas’ health services department collects its data in the annual Texas Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System telephone survey, and like Witters noted that people tend to underreport their health risk factors in phone interviews. The 2012 BRFSS was conducted throughout the year; the BMI portion had 8,530 respondents and a 95 percent confidence interval, Mann said. Our ruling Lucio said nearly 40 percent of his McAllen-area constituents suffer from obesity. McAllen’s metropolitan statistical area in 2012 had 38.5 percent obesity among adults, according to the Gallup-Healthways study. A state survey that year suggested that nearly 45 percent of the region’s residents were obese. We rate Lucio’s statement as True.

It's colder in the U.S. than on Mars, Twitterverse says
","The polar vortex takes no prisoners. At the start of 2014, the Midwest, East Coast and parts of Canada experienced brutally cold temperatures, some of them record-breaking. We’ve seen pitiable tweets from #ChiBeria and tales of people burning themselves in the name of cold-weather science. But what really caught our eye was the number of people comparing the climates of Earth and Mars. There’s no shortage of claims on Twitter about different cities being colder than Mars: Minneapolis, Toronto, Chicago, you name it. Outlets like Yahoo and Smithsonian magazine also spread the information around with more nuanced reports. PolitiFact is owned by the Tampa Bay Times, which is based in sunny St. Petersburg, Fla., so not everyone on staff is a cold-weather expert. So we touched base with scientists to see whether the United States and Canada really have been colder than Mars. The answer is not cut and dried. ""While technically true, it’s a goofy comparison,"" said Ben Longmier, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. ""The temperatures on Mars fluctuate like they do on Earth."" We know that stepping outside in Chicago doesn’t feel the same as in Rio de Janeiro or Stockholm. Mars is no different. The assertion that Earth is colder than Mars is based on temperatures from NASA’s robotic rover, Curiosity, which measured a maximum ground temperature of minus 33 degrees Fahrenheit at the time we wrote this story. That’s roughly on par with one of the coldest U.S. cities. Minneapolis saw minus 23 F, with a wind chill that made it feel like minus 48 F. Winnipeg, Canada, the reference point for Yahoo’s Geekquinox post, which other news sources and tweets referenced, experienced similar temperatures. So the ""real feel"" is colder in those cities than on Mars -- at least in one sense. But not so fast. The air on Mars is much colder than its surface. Curiosity reports that the air temperature from its location is between minus 193 and minus 76. And again, that’s just at one location on the planet. Samuel Kounaves, a chemistry professor at Tufts University who specializes in planetary sciences, said the average air temperature on Mars is about minus 50. So the coldest places in the United States and Canada can edge out the warmest places on Mars, especially if we look at Mars ground temperature, not air temperature. But on average, there’s no question that Mars is colder. After all, Mars is tens of millions of miles further from the sun than Earth is. That said, let’s not get too carried away in technicalities and lose sight of what really matters here. ""Either way, it's darn cold in Michigan right now!"" Longmier said. Our ruling We’ve seen a lot of tweets about how it’s colder in the United States and Canada than it is on Mars, due to the frigid weather system known as the polar vortex. But that’s only correct if we cherry-pick the highest Mars temperatures. On average, our hypothetical Martian brethren are still way colder.

Ian Bremmer compares big gains for top 1 percent to stagnation for bottom 99 percent
","President Barack Obama and his allies have increasingly focused on income inequality as a top policy challenge for 2014. A recent tweet by Ian Bremmer, a leading expert on the intersection between international relations and finance, seemed to provide some fuel for Obama’s concern. Bremmer is the president and founder of the Eurasia Group, an international research and consulting firm, as well as a global research professor at New York University. On Jan. 4, 2014, he tweeted, ""US: Change in Income, 2009-13. Top 1%: +31.4%. Bottom 99%: +0.4%."" We thought we’d take a closer look at Bremmer’s numbers. We struck paydirt when we looked at the most recent data compiled by Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California who has spent years studying inequality, most often with Thomas Piketty, a French economist. In his paper, Saez found that between 2009 and 2012, the top 1 percent’s incomes grew by 31.4 percent while the bottom 99 percent’s incomes grew by 0.4 percent -- the same numbers Bremer had tweeted. This means, according to Saez’s paper, that the top 1 percent ""captured 95 percent of the income gains in the first three years of the recovery."" So Bremmer can point to solid sourcing for his claim. However, not everyone is enamored of the Piketty-Saez approach. Alan Reynolds, a scholar with the libertarian Cato Institute, has written that the Piketty-Saez methodology tends to exaggerate the earnings of the top 1 percent and underestimate the earnings of the bottom 99 percent. The Piketty-Saez method uses pre-tax income and includes realized capital gains. This effectively boosts the measured income of the richest Americans, since they earn a lot of capital gains and they pay a lot of taxes. Meanwhile, for the 99 percent, the Piketty-Saez method excludes transfer income -- that is, payments from the government to individuals, including such items as Social Security, unemployment insurance, Medicaid and food stamps. Reynolds estimated that such transfer payments accounted for more than 16 percent of personal income in 2009. Transfer payments, he wrote, totaled $2.3 trillion in 2012. Also, Reynolds argues that way the Piketty-Saez numbers are calculated makes them subject to short-term fluctuations based on taxes. He suggests that the prospect of higher taxes in 2013 may have led to a surge of bonuses and cashing out of investments that would be subject to capital gains taxes -- something that also happened in 1992 and 1986. If true, this tendency would magnify an otherwise minor error in how Bremmer phrased his tweet. Bremmer tweeted that the figures covered the period 2009 to 2013; in fact, the Saez data, covers 2009 to 2012. The 2013 data are not available yet -- but they could look different due to the timing issue. (Bremmer told PolitiFact that he'd meant to communicate that the data went from 2009 to the start of 2013, ""but that could have been expressed more clearly."") In the meantime, one could easily produce a more nuanced narrative than the familiar rich-get-richer story. Consider this table published in the most recent Saez paper:   Time period Average real growth in income Real income growth for top 1 percent Real income growth for bottom 99 percent Fraction of total growth (or loss) captured by top 1 percent Full period, 1993-2012 17.9 percent 86.1 percent 6.6 percent 68 percent Clinton Expansion, 1993-2000 31.5 percent 98.7 percent 20.3 percent 45 percent 2001 Recession, 2000-2002 -11.7 percent -30.8 percent -6.5 percent 57 percent (of losses) Bush Expansion, 2002-2007 16.1 percent 61.8 percent 6.8 percent 65 percent Great Recession 2007-2009 -17.4 percent -36.3 percent -11.6 percent 49 percent (of losses) Recovery, 2009-2012 6.0 percent 31.4 percent 0.4 percent 95 percent   This table -- Saez’s own data -- shows that the top 1 percent saw its inflation-adjusted income drop by 36.3 percent during the great recession, then recover by only 31.4 percent. In other words, the top 1 percent actually had a net loss between 2007 and 2012 -- a more modest net loss than the one suffered by the bottom 99 percent, to be sure, but a decline that muddies the easy story line. Even a scholar who’s sympathetic to the Piketty-Saez approach acknowledges that it’s not the only way to look at the numbers. ""If you want the distribution of market income produced by the economy and as reported for income taxes, the Piketty-Saez numbers are the right numbers,"" said Timothy M. Smeeding, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin. ""But if you want to gauge the effect of government programs on the income distribution, especially for the poor or middle classes, the outcome is different and cannot be measured by Piketty-Saez number."" Smeeding says that the degree of inequality is eased ""a bit"" once you take into account taxes and benefits. Still, he said, the top 1 percent still ""gets a bigger share, just not as big"" as the Piketty-Saez numbers show.

Taking into account taxes and transfer payments would reduce -- though likely not eliminate -- the difference in income gains between the 1 percent and the 99 percent. In addition, Bremmer acknowledged that his phrasing about the time frame for the data could have been clearer.

Greenwald: NSA leaker Snowden has no whistleblower protection
","Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who revealed the reach of American intelligence into the private lives of its citizens, is approaching a legal turning point. He is at the midpoint in his one-year asylum granted by Russia. What lies beyond is uncharted territory. The New York Times editorial board said the government should grant Snowden clemency and a plea arrangement that contains a limited punishment. Others, including White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice, have said Snowden should return without conditions and ""have his day in court."" In the view of Glenn Greenwald, the investigative journalist who was one of the first to gain access to Snowden’s stolen documents, a fair trial is the last thing that awaits the whistleblower if he comes back without a deal. ""Under the Espionage Act, you're not allowed to come into court and say ‘I was justified in disclosing this information’,"" Greenwald said on CNN’s The Lead. ""There is no whistleblower exception in the Espionage Act."" Greenwald’s debate with Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post made for good television. But we wanted to dig deeper into Greenwald’s point about Snowden. There are two pieces to this puzzle. What does the law say and could Snowden reasonably expect to tell his side of the story in a trial? Limited protections for the intelligence community The Espionage Act of 1917 makes it a crime punishable by death or imprisonment to share ""information relating to the national defense"" with anyone who might want to do harm to the United States. Snowden faces two counts of unauthorized communication under that law. The Espionage Act contains no explicit whistleblower protection, said Bob Turner, a national security expert at the University of Virginia who has been critical of Greenwald and thinks Snowden should face the death penalty. However, Turned noted that while the 1917 law is silent, a law passed in 1998, the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, does provide government workers with options. Under that law, Snowden could have raised his concerns with the Inspector General’s Office at the NSA or spoken to congressional intelligence committees. A separate federal law protects whistleblowers more generally but that only applies to sharing unclassified information, not the secret materials that Snowden had in hand. ""Had Mr. Snowden taken his information to the House or Senate intelligence committees, that would clearly not have violated the Espionage Act,"" Turner said. ""And if it did, his conduct would have been protected by the more recent 1998 whistleblower statute."" But others familiar with this legal landscape told us that no matter what, Snowden was still vulnerable. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, for instance, does not prohibit agencies from retaliating against employees, said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program at New York University School of Law. Goitein said President Barack Obama helped matters slightly when he issued a presidential order preventing retaliation against federal employees. But that order did not explicitly address the rights of contractors such as Snowden. And Goitein added, neither that directive nor the whistleblower law ""bars the government from criminally prosecuting whistleblowers."" In 2010, NSA staffer Thomas Drake tried to use proper channels to report allegations of improper contracting but wound up the target of an investigation, said Kathleen McClellan, the national security and human rights counsel for the Government Accountability Project, a whistleblower advocacy group. ""Drake followed the Intelligence Community Whistleblower law to a ‘T’,"" McClellan said. ""He went to the Department of Defense inspector general and both congressional intelligence committees and it did not protect him from retaliation. In fact, it made him the target of an investigation."" Federal agents wrongly went after Drake in pursuit of a separate matter and charged him with multiple felonies, according to a report from the Committee to Protect Journalists. When it became clear that whatever Drake had shared with the press was either not classified or already in the public domain, the government’s felony case collapsed. A federal judge said it was ""unconscionable"" that Drake and his family had endured ""four years of hell."" Restrictions within the courtroom Greenwald said Snowden would not be allowed to justify his actions in court. On this front, we can’t offer a definitive assessment. We don’t know what matters government prosecutors would permit into the courtroom, and we don’t know how a judge would rule on the government’s motions. However, recent trials under the Espionage Act make it clear that Snowden could expect no guarantee that he would be able to tell a jury why his violations might serve the country’s national interests. What he and his lawyers could present might be tightly constrained. ""The executive branch has asserted the sole authority to determine what remains a secret,"" McClellan said. ""The way these Espionage Act prosecutions have gone, it has not been fair to the defendants. It has not followed what you would expect in a traditional trial."" Turner of the University of Virginia said he thinks public sympathy for Snowden is so broad, he might do fine with a jury. ""All he needs to walk free is a single juror who views him as a ‘hero’,"" Turner said. But whether any juror would hear a single reference to Snowden’s claims to a higher purpose is also unclear. In 2012, a federal judge ruled that former CIA worker John Kiriakou could not present evidence about his reasons for going public with accounts of U.S. waterboarding during interrogations. Kiriakou was charged with disclosing classified information under the Espionage Act. ""Any claim that he acted with a salutary motive, or that he acted without a subversive motive, when he allegedly communicated NDI (national defense information) to journalists is not relevant to this case,"" the judge wrote. The trial of leaker Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning -- who gave troves of classified information to WikiLeaks -- followed similar lines, with the important difference that those proceedings took place in a military courtroom. Our ruling Greenwald said that if Snowden returned to the United States, he would have no protections under the Espionage Act and would not be allowed to justify his actions in court. In terms of the law, Greenwald is literally correct. Two other legal documents, however, could have provided Snowden some potential protections before he shared classified information with the press. But once he did, no law offers Snowden any shelter. Greenwald’s further claim on what Snowden could say in his defense is less clear because it depends on what government prosecutors would do. We can’t assess the accuracy of any statement about future outcomes. However, it is clear that there is ample precedent to show that Snowden would have no guaranteed opportunity to explain his motivations. Folding in that ambiguity, we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8A44C0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/07/glenn-greenwald/greenwald-nsa-leaker-snowden-has-no-whistleblower-/
"['Housing', 'Florida', 'Gus Bilirakis']","
Gus Bilirakis says his flood insurance bill would make the premium on a $100K home 'maybe $200 or $300 annually'
","While millions of indebted Florida homeowners are already trying to keep their heads above water, recently enacted flood insurance regulations are threatening to swamp the housing market with even more problems. With the end of subsidized flood coverage, Florida legislators have been looking for ways to keep their constituents from drowning in sky-high premiums. One such solution is a bill co-sponsored by Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Palm Harbor, who recently discussed the measure with Bay News 9 anchor Al Ruechel. After listening to Bilirakis explain his bill, Ruechel asked the congressman what it might cost to cover a home worth $100,000. Bilirakis’ answer was eye-popping, according to a reader who brought it to our attention: ""Well, we’re saying maybe, I’m approximating, but maybe $200 to $300 annually. Approximate. Because I’ve done these figures in the past."" The reader told us he couldn’t believe his ears, and frankly, neither could we. Would a $100,000 home really only cost as little as $200 a year to cover under the Bilirakis bill? We dove into this claim with both feet. A deluge of problems First and foremost, the 12th District representative’s figure sounded so low that it led us to wonder if Bilirakis had simply misspoken. We asked his office if that was the case. They assured us he had, meaning to say ""monthly"" instead of ""annually."" So if you were watching and thought your flood insurance bill could end up being only a few hundred dollars a year, sorry to disappoint you, but his office did correct the statement. But let’s go through the math, anyway. Bilirakis was referring to his proposed H.R. 3312, the Homeowners Flood Insurance Relief Act of 2013, which was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on Oct. 23. The bipartisan bill is co-sponsored in part by Florida’s Thomas Rooney and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, both Republicans, and Democrat Kathy Castor. It’s a response to the Biggert Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, which Bilirakis supported. The law took effect on Oct. 1, 2013, and Bilirakis and other lawmakers have since been focusing on how to handle the law’s consequences. (Lawmakers said they didn’t realize such dramatic rate increases would happen.) Biggert-Waters ended subsidized premiums for the troubled National Flood Insurance Program, which is some $24 billion in debt, leading to astronomical increases for some homeowners. Homes with severe or repetitive losses, along with second homes and businesses, face rates that are allowed to rise 25 percent per year until they mirror their true risk of flooding. That applies to some 50,000 policyholders in Florida. Other homeowners in flood-prone areas will be grandfathered in at current rates unless they sell their homes or let their policies lapse. About 115,000 subsidized condos or multifamily homes won’t be affected, nor will about 1.8 million Florida policies currently not being subsidized. Some horror stories about changes in premiums involve homes being hit with insurance bills quintupling or worse, climbing well into five figures for a year of coverage. Many neighborhoods in flood-prone areas are already reporting dismal sales figures, with sellers frightened off by sky-high insurance quotes. The problem is especially troublesome for Florida, which Gov. Rick Scott claimed has paid out four times what it has received in flood claims over the last 35 years. We found that Mostly True. H.R. 3312 isn’t the only attempt to deal with this problem. The Senate has been struggling with its own measures, and Florida legislators are proposing a competing market set up by private insurers. The Bilirakis bill does a couple things: First, it caps the maximum flood insurance premium levied on a structure at 1/30th of the property’s appraised value at the time of sale. This is based on the concept of a 30-year mortgage and is meant to establish a baseline of coverage. Second, it would spread any increase over current premiums across a 10-year phase-in period, during which time the premium would get incrementally higher until it reached the maximum. FEMA, which evaluates the amount of risk faced by each property, would have the flexibility to determine that rate of increase. The bill would allow homeowners to pay for flood coverage in monthly installments, instead of an annual lump sum payment. So, using the example of a $100,000 home, the annual premium would be limited to 1/30th of $100,000, or $3,333.33 per year (we’ll round down, but actuaries probably won’t be as generous). Spread out over 12 months, that would be a monthly payment of $277.77. A $250,000 home would have a maximum premium of $8,333.33, with a $694.44 monthly payment, and so on. Only in Florida would an insurance bill that high be considered reasonable, but it still provides a cap to the exorbitant rates possible under Biggert-Waters. It’s also quite a bit higher than a couple of hundred dollars a year. Our ruling Bilirakis told Bay News 9 his bill would limit a $100,000 home’s flood insurance bill to ""$200 to $300 annually."" That didn’t add up to us, and when we asked his office about it, they told us he meant to say ""monthly"", not ""annually.""   We do appreciate it when elected leaders admit they’re wrong. Unfortunately for homeowners paying for flood insurance, Bilirakis used the wrong word in the interview, and we have to rate the wording of this particular statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA67540>],/factchecks/2014/jan/07/gus-bilirakis/gus-bilirakis-says-his-flood-insurance-bill-would-/
"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Johnny Isakson']","
Isakson doesn't make the grade on his claim about college degrees and unemployment
","Parents who scrimp, save and borrow to put their children through college don’t like hearing that a four-year degree may not be the door-opener they hoped. But that’s what U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, among others, is out there saying. And Isakson is pointing fingers at a specific type of school -- liberal arts colleges. ""Career academies are the future,"" Isakson said at a Dec. 4 town hall meeting in Coweta County. ""Fifty-three percent of graduates from liberal arts academies couldn’t find employment, but almost 89 percent who graduated from technical schools did so."" Isakson repeated the claim about liberal arts school students in a visit to The Newnan Times-Herald on the same day. Those are steep unemployment statistics for college graduates of any stripe. PolitiFact Georgia decided to do some homework on the senator’s numbers. Isakson based his statement on data developed by The Associated Press in 2012 with help from researchers. Those numbers show 1.5 million adults, or 53.6 percent of bachelor’s degree-holders under age 25, were either jobless or underemployed in 2011. In both Georgia appearances, Isakson applied the worrisome AP statistics to liberal arts school graduates. But the AP report was about all graduates, not any specific degree holders. ""I am certain that Sen. Isakson’s intent was to convey the general message of the AP study,"" said Lauren Culbertson, the senator’s deputy communications director. Isakson is hardly the first to cite the AP report, which some education researchers say overstated the difficulties that graduates were having finding employment or landing jobs that matched their skills. Just a day before he visited Coweta County, Isakson attended the Cobb County Economic Forecast breakfast, where Albert Niemi Jr., nationally acclaimed dean of the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University, gave a speech that referenced a 2012 article in The Atlantic on the AP findings. Niemi said about half of the college graduates between 2007 and 2012 were unemployed or underemployed. He used the findings to make the case that a college diploma isn’t worth what it once was and that today’s graduates need teachable ""hard skills,"" if they hope to get hired. Isakson left the Cobb breakfast with a hard copy of Niemi’s PowerPoint presentation, Culbertson said. Anthony P. Carnevale, director and research professor at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, said the 2012 report ""grossly misrepresents the truth"" about college grads in general. The unemployment rate for college graduates is under 5 percent now, Carnevale said. In 2011, it was about 7 percent for new college graduates, substantially less than the unemployment rate for high school graduates, he said. It was that way throughout the Great Recession, Carnevale said. ""College unemployment went up, but much less than the unemployment rates of non-college graduates,"" he said. ""The value of college is still high."" Other educators and researchers say they see nothing to reflect major struggles for liberal arts school graduates as opposed to other degree holders. The Association of American Colleges and Universities is about to release a report that suggests the unemployment rate for liberal arts graduates is quite low and not much higher than other graduates, said Debra Humphreys, the association's vice president for policy and public engagement. Enrollment has been ""strong"" at the public liberal arts colleges and universities that are part of the North Carolina-based Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges, said Bill Spellman, the consortium’s director. ""Students and parents are feeling that that well-rounded education is going to be an advantage, if not initially, then midway in their careers,"" Spellman said. They see the importance of having ""those transferable skills of critical thinking, writing and speaking and of being able to be nimble for jobs that haven’t even been created,"" he said. Colleges throughout Georgia offer bachelor of arts degrees. And at Georgia College in Milledgeville, the state’s only recognized public liberal arts college, 78 percent of students in the Class of 2012 reported having jobs within three months of graduation, said Brittiny Barber Johnson, the college’s manager of media relations. The results were based on responses from 241 of the 1,136 undergraduates who received their degrees in May 2012, Johnson said. Of the students who responded, 43 percent said they were working in a job ""highly related"" to their major, she said. But to people who listened to Isakson at a town hall meeting at the Coweta campus of West Georgia Technical College, a much different picture emerged. Isakson told the audience 53 percent of graduates from liberal arts academies weren’t finding jobs. By contrast, he said nearly 89 percent of tech school graduates had landed jobs. Mike Light, longtime spokesman for the Technical College System of Georgia, said Isakson's numbers for the state’s technical schools appear spot-on. Officials at individual technical schools are seeing about 90 percent of their graduates finding jobs and, systemwide, that number is about 85 percent, Light said. ""They’ve got the in-demand careers,"" he said. So where does that leave us? Isakson said that 53 percent of graduates from liberal arts colleges can’t find a job. On the face of it, he incorrectly quoted an AP report, which makes no attempt to single out liberal arts graduates and their ability to find work. He also failed to mention that the 53 percent figure included not only jobless grads, but also many people who were finding jobs, albeit in lower-paying positions than one might expect. And even that report is viewed with suspicion in some quarters. Some college graduates are having trouble finding work. Isakson is correct about that. But his statement misquotes numbers in a study that itself has been questioned. We rate Isakson’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7DDB00>],/factchecks/2014/jan/07/johnny-isakson/isakson-doesnt-make-grade-his-claim-about-college-/

R.I. Sierra Club official says despite its “astronomical” taxes, Norway is not losing population
","Depending on your political point of view, taxes are either an enormous drag on the economy or a shared burden to support necessary infrastructure and services. Count Jonathan L. Harris, chairman of the Rhode Island Sierra Club’s transportation committee, in the latter group. In a Dec. 24, 2013,  commentary in The Providence Journal, he made an energetic counterargument to the notion that tax increases drive productive residents to lower-taxing jurisdictions. ""Heck, you don’t see Norway losing population, and its taxes are astronomical,"" Harris wrote. With its long winter nights, Norway is a prime place for astronomical observations, such as watching the aurora borealis. Are its taxes sky-high? And do Norwegians tend to stay put, regardless? We decided to check. First, Harris is right about the population. According to Eurostat, the census bureau of the European Union, Norway’s population grew 11 percent between 2003 and 2013, to a record high of 5.05 million people, about the same population as the State of Colorado. So how about those ""astronomical"" taxes? Just as different countries speak different languages, different nations’ tax systems are often set up in ways that make direct comparisons difficult. For example, both the United States and Norway tax income. But Norway, like much of Europe,also imposes a ""value added tax"" on items sold at retail that assesses a tax at each step of production, rather than at the point of sale. The United States has no comparable tax. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based association of 34 developed nations that share information and study economic policy, tracks an array of economic statistics from its member nations. One those statistics is taxation. To make apples-to-apples comparisons of tax burdens between nations, the OECD looks at how much a nation collects in tax revenue each year and  calculates what percentage that represents of the country’s gross domestic product, the monetary value of everything the country produced in that year In 2011, the most recent year for which the OECD had complete figures, the United States federal tax bite was 24 percent of its gross domestic product. That was 32nd of the 34 OECD nations. The lowest was Mexico at 19.7 percent and Chile at 21.2 percent. Norway? It placed seventh on the list, with a national tax obligation equal to 42.5 percent of its gross domestic product, a little short of twice the United State’s share. Of the top ten, eight countries were over 40 percent of their GDP, with Denmark topping the list at 47.7 percent. Half of the  OECD countries had levels over 34.1 percent.    Our ruling Jonathan Harris of the Rhode Island chapter of the Sierra Club said, ""You don’t see Norway losing population, and its taxes are astronomical."" Census data shows he’s correct on the first point. On the second point, by the OECD measure, Norway’s relative tax burden is among the highest in the world. Federal taxes would need to be hiked 77 percent in the United States to reach Norway’s level. Is Norway’s ranking, seventh out of 34, ""astronomical""? We believe it’s close enough for a Mostly True.

Marco Rubio says nearly one in five Floridians live in poverty
","Fifty years ago, President Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty. Since then, says Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., taxpayers have spent $20 trillion on welfare and other government programs intended to lift them out of poverty -- yet tens of millions of Americans are still impoverished. ""In my home state, nearly one in five Floridians live in poverty,"" Rubio said in a Jan. 5 video message. ""After 50 years, isn’t it time to declare big government’s war on poverty a failure?"" Rubio called for a new agenda to help people lift themselves out of poverty and create a new ""opportunity society"" to enable people to live the American dream. Rubio is expected to release additional details Wednesday during a speech at the U.S. Capitol hosted by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Rubio released his video as the Senate returns to take up the issue of renewing emergency unemployment benefits that lapsed in December. Also, Democrats have announced that they will target income equality as a top issue this election year, including a push to raise the federal minimum wage. Here we will fact-check Rubio’s claim that nearly one in five Floridians live in poverty. Census data on poverty and Florida First, some background. The Census Bureau, the official federal record-keeper for poverty rates, determines poverty status by comparing annual income to a set of dollar values called poverty thresholds that vary by family size, the number of related children and the age of the householder. For example in 2012, that would mean a single person earning $11,720 or a family of four earning $23,492 would be considered poor. A Rubio spokesman told PolitiFact Florida that he arrived at his figure of nearly one in five Floridians based on a story in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune that said Florida’s poverty rate was 17.1 percent in 2012, according to the census. In 2012, Florida had a higher percentage living in poverty than the national average of 15.9 percent. Using the 2012 figure of 17.1 percent would place the number of Floridians in poverty closer to one in six than one in five. ""You’re correct that 17.1 is between one-in-six and one-in-five,"" Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told PolitiFact in an email. ""He said 'nearly' 1 in 5, but he could have said ""more than"" 1 in 6. Either way, I think we can all agree that 17.1 percent is too high a number."" (The numbers are even worse if we zero in on Rubio’s home county of Miami-Dade where about one in four residents lived in poverty in 2012.) Another way to look at the percentage of Floridians in poverty is by using the census’ three year average between 2010-12. That average showed that 15.4 percent of Floridians lived in poverty -- or about one in six Floridians. One footnote: While we’re not rating Rubio’s claim that the war on poverty is a failure, we will note that in 1964 the official poverty rate was even higher nationally than it is now -- 19 percent. Our ruling Rubio said that ""nearly one in five Floridians live in poverty."" He points to 2012 census data which showed that 17.1 percent of Floridians lived in poverty,  which would mean about one in six Floridians live in poverty. The percentage is slightly lower if we look at the three year average which showed 15.4 percent living in poverty -- still about one in six. Rubio’s numbers are close. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7B1100>],/factchecks/2014/jan/06/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-nearly-one-five-floridians-live-p/

Facebook group: The No. 2 owner of Fox News is Prince Alwaleed bin Talal who said 'a strong American government is not good for us'
","The Facebook post with the man in traditional Arab dress and a herd of camels purports to be a public service announcement. The meme identifies the man as ""Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal"" and quotes him as saying, ""A strong American Government is not good for us."" The twist: ""#2 Owner of Fox News. Just thought you should know."" The post by Americans Against the Republican Party was shared and liked thousands of times, generating a ton of discussion. A reader asked us to weigh in. The royal billionaire We reached out to the group, linked to liberal site Addicting Info, but did not hear back. We also had no luck reaching spokespeople for Fox News or the prince. A trail of public records and flashy news stories helped fill in some of the blanks. Not all. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz Alsaud, 58, whose grandfather was the founding king of modern Saudi Arabia, is no stranger to the United States or Western media. He considers himself a ""great friend"" of America and the ""world’s foremost value investor."" He’s really rich: The American-educated multibillionaire has made investments around the world, including many in Western entities such as CitiGroup, the George V hotel in Paris, the Plaza hotel in New York, Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, Apple, TimeWarner, Saks, Twitter (here’s his account) and yes, News Corp. In July 2013, Bloomberg rated him the 16th richest man in the world, with a net worth of $26.6 billion. Forbes ranked him No. 26 earlier at $20 billion and followed up with a story about his wealth that infuriated Alwaleed, who threatened to sue for libel and said the magazine undervalued his net worth. Forbes defended its work. Best we can tell, the picture is of Prince Alwaleed. Fox financials Alwaleed’s interest in News Corp., the media conglomerate of Rupert Murdoch and once-parent company to Fox News, started in 1997 with a $400 million investment, according to a description of the investment on Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding Co.’s website. That was 3 percent of News Corp.’s worth. In 2005, he increased his holding to 5.5 percent, the site states. The picture is a little different now because News Corp. split into two companies in June 2013 amid fallout from the company’s phone-hacking controversy with its British newspapers. The move spawned a new News Corp., housing publications such as the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Vogue. A second company, 21st Century Fox, oversees movies and TV programming, including the Fox News Channel. Murdoch is chairman of both companies and controls just under 80 percent of the voting stock in each (between himself and his family trust). Who’s next in line? According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, it’s Alwaleed. Alwaleed owns 7 percent of Class B voting stock with 21st Century Fox, second only to Murdoch, as of Aug. 19. The filing notes, in compliance with federal securities law, 40 percent of Alwaleed’s voting rights are suspended because he is not an American citizen. He is the third largest stockholder in the new News Corp., trailing Murdoch and an investment firm, with a 6.6 percent stake. The relationship with Murdoch is reciprocal. News Corp. has a sizable stake in Rotana, a broadcasting company that airs Arabic and English programming in the Middle East. Alwaleed owns an 80 percent stake of Rotana, according to Bloomberg. So Alwaleed has a sizable interest in Fox News, second in one aspect only to Murdoch. Experts told us that translates to being the No. 2 owner of Fox News. It’s accurate to say he’s the No. 2 owner, but he’s more of a passive major shareholder, said Jay Ritter, University of Florida finance professor, pointing out Alwaleed does not have a seat on the company’s board of directors. His investment resembles other stocks held in major companies by mutual funds and investment firms, who invest big in public companies but do not intend to take over. What about the quote? In many ways, the crux of this fact-check is whether Alwaleed said, ""A strong American Government is not good for us."" Who the ""us"" is in the meme is not clear -- it could mean Fox News. Or it could mean Saudis or Muslims. We searched for the quote in the meme in full and in part using Lexis Nexis and Google, with the assistance of a news researcher. It did not come up. A Google search of the full quote reveals few results, mainly linking to message boards or Facebook comments about the meme. The closest thing to the supposed quote we found came from a June 2013 Wall Street Journal article about U.S. shale-oil production. Alwaleed was quoted in a letter saying the rise in U.S. oil production would be a threat to Saudi Arabia. ""We see that rising North American shale gas production is an inevitable threat,"" he wrote. It’s possible the meme wildly conflated those comments. But even if so, the context is wildly misleading. Our ruling Internet memes sometimes make us laugh. This one is frustrating. The post is correct that Prince Alwaleed is the No. 2 owner of Fox News (technically, 21st Century Fox, the giant movie and TV corporation that owns the network). It’s one of his many Western investments. But we found no evidence the frequent guest of American media actually said, ""A strong American government is bad for us."" We especially could not find it uttered under the context in which the meme may intend for you to understand it: that a strong American government is bad for Fox News. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7DD700>],/factchecks/2014/jan/06/facebook-posts/facebook-group-no-2-owner-fox-news-prince-alwaleed/

Kathleen Peters called a press conference on Dec. 19 to accuse rival David Jolly of promoting the health insurance law during his days as a lobbyist, even though he has said he opposes it. ""David Jolly claims that he opposes Obamacare, but that didn't stop him from lobbying for government-run health care just last year, when he made over $80,000 from special interests,"" Peters said. ""In 2012, David Jolly lobbied only one client in Florida, Faneuil Inc., which is a company that runs call centers for Obamacare. Even for a Washington insider, it takes a special kind of dishonesty to publicly oppose Obamacare while personally profiting from it."" Given Jolly’s stance to repeal the Affordable Care Act, it would indeed be awkward if he made $80,000 lobbying for the law. We decided to check the paperwork on this one. Peters makes a call on call center Jolly worked as an aide and general counsel for the late U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young for more than a decade before becoming a lobbyist in 2007 for Washington firm Van Scoyoc Associates. He then lobbied through his own firm, Three Bridges Advisors, from 2011 until earlier this year, when he de-registered as a lobbyist to run for Young’s vacant House seat. Lobbyists are required by law to disclose their clients, and Jolly listed work as a consultant for Faneuil in statements filed Dec. 2. The form requires candidates to list all positions both paid and unpaid in the current calendar year and the two years prior. Faneuil is a Virginia company that specializes in ""business processing solutions,"" such as running call centers, managing data entry or billing and providing customer service by phone or email. Peters couldn’t provide specifics to link Jolly to lobbying in connection with the health care law, while Jolly’s team said he worked for the company to advocate for ""transportation interests in Florida."" Faneuil provides toll collectors and other employees under a staffing contract with the Florida Department of Transportation. Faneuil general counsel Alden J. Eldredge also said Jolly didn’t work on matters dealing with the health care law. Faneuil employed Jolly’s Three Bridges Advisors firm in the Sunshine State from May to December 2012.  In March 2013, Faneuil announced it had been selected to operate a Spokane, Wash., call center for the state’s health insurance exchange, Washington Healthplanfinder. The center began taking calls for enrollment assistance on Oct. 1. Neither Jolly nor Faneuil would further specify Jolly’s role with the company, although Jolly’s campaign emphasized that the Washington call center contract wasn’t awarded to Faneuil until March 2013, when Jolly was no longer being paid. Peters didn’t connect her own dots in the ensuing days. The following week, a flier appeared throughout Pinellas County mailboxes with slightly different wording: ""Last year, Washington lobbyist Jolly was paid at least $80,000 to represent a D.C.-area company that signs up people for Obamacare,"" it reads. ""Yet, as a candidate, he continues to claim he’s opposed to Obamacare … and makes false attacks against Kathleen Peters for her position."" That last part is aimed at Jolly’s previous assertion that Peters was not clearly in favor of repealing the Affordable Care Act. PolitiFact Florida checked a previous mailer from Jolly’s campaign that alleged Peters ""refuses to ‘take a stand’ to repeal Obamacare."" We found that claim Mostly False. Otherwise, the mailer avoids saying specifically that Jolly had been ""lobbying for government-run health care,"" as she said in the press conference. Our ruling Peters said at a press conference that Jolly was guilty of ""lobbying for government-run health care just last year."" She was attempting to link her opponent with Faneuil, a company that has worked with Washington state to operate a health care exchange. Both Jolly and Faneuil say Jolly wasn’t lobbying on health care, and we didn’t find specific evidence to show that he worked on that project. Peters later backed off the accusation, changing the wording in a mailer to point out Jolly was being paid by a company that also is paid for operating an Obamacare health exchange. Peters didn’t find any specific evidence linking Jolly to the Washington call center project, and we didn’t find anything more in our own review of the public records. Meanwhile, the Jolly campaign offers a plausible explanation for what kind of work he did for the company. Due to a lack of evidence, we rate Peters’ statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB9F70C0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/06/kathleen-peters/kathleen-peters-says-david-jolly-was-lobbying-gove/
"['Health Care', 'PunditFact', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney: Obamacare tells people 'precisely what type of coverage they have to have'
","Mitt Romney may no longer be a presidential candidate, but he remains a vocal critic of President Barack Obama, particularly Obama’s health care law. During an appearance Jan. 5 on Fox News Sunday, the Republican and former Massachusetts governor weighed in on the Affordable Care Act as it enters an important year of the rollout. ""It's not just that the president tells people that they have to buy health insurance; it's that he tells them what health insurance they have to buy,"" Romney said. ""The idea that the government knows better than the American people what kind of insurance they have to have makes no sense, and it's something ... I think the American people are rejecting in large numbers."" Romney put it more succinctly later in the program when he said that the federal health care law tells ""the American people precisely what type of coverage they have to have."" This issue came up quite a bit toward the end of 2013, when millions of Americans discovered their current health insurance policies did not meet minimum standards for coverage required by the law. But is it fair to say the federal government is telling Americans what insurance they have to buy and dictating the type of coverage they must own? For insurance sold on the individual market — i.e. plans purchased individually and not through an employer — there are requirements of what’s included in a policy. The administration calls them the 10 ""essential health benefits."" They are: Ambulatory patient services Emergency services Hospitalization Maternity and newborn care Mental health and substance use disorder services Prescription drugs Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices Laboratory services Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management Pediatric services Plans sold in the individual markets must meet those requirements. That means some people who aren’t thinking about having children — or can’t have children — will still need to purchase coverage for maternity care and pediatric services. Others who don’t regularly rely on prescription drugs will still pay for a plan that includes it. Critics, such as Romney, say this requires people to pay for coverage they don’t need or want. Proponents say the alternative (a.k.a. pre-Obamacare) was an individual market where people were often paying for plans that actually provided very little coverage and the new law sets minimum standards. And, like plans purchased through your employer, requiring everyone to pay for certain coverage, even if they don’t need it, will spread the risk around and keep the cost lower for everyone. In practice, it means fox example that men and women will pay the same rates for equivalent coverage, and women won't be charged more because they can have children. The 10 essential health benefits apply to any plan that has not been grandfathered into the law. In practice, that includes all of the plans purchased in the individual markets offered by the federal government or states. It also includes any businesses with 50 or more full-time employees who previously did not offer insurance to their workers (Obama delayed the employer mandate until 2015). To be clear, there’s still choice in the individual market. While there are minimum coverage requirements regardless of the policy, 95 percent of consumers who buy insurance on the federal marketplace will have a choice between options offered by two or more insurance providers. In the 36 states where the federal government is running or assisting the marketplace, the average consumer has a choice between 53 health insurance options. Those choices range from less costly catastrophic insurance for younger adults to the higher-tiered bronze, silver and gold plans. Consumers can choose to pay more for more coverage and benefits. So Romney is right that the health insurance law is mandating some type of coverage, but he’s exaggerating as to the extent. That’s even more true for Americans who already receive their health insurance through an employer. Their plans are not required to offer the 10 essential benefits if they were in place before March 2010, though they are required to make some more minor changes. One of them requires insurers to spend at least 80 percent of someone’s premium on patient care. Employers also cannot significantly decrease the benefits, or risk losing grandfathered status, but they can make changes. (For the record, individual plans also can avoid the 10 essential benefits if they are considered grandfathered under the law. That’s easier said than done, however, and prompted the cancellations letters that came out last year. Obama has asked that some old, expiring plans remain on the books one more year before transitioning out.) Our ruling Romney said the administration is telling ""the American people precisely what type of coverage they have to have.""  We were unable to reach Romney. The health care law does mandate some types of coverage, and for some people, requires 10 essential health benefits. But it’s not nearly as sweeping as Romney makes it sound. The biggest changes are on the individual market, while people who get their insurance through an employer will see far fewer major changes, if any. We rate his statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9CC540>],/factchecks/2014/jan/05/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-obamacare-tells-people-precisely-what-/

Obama adviser Gene Sperling says administration offered 'no magic number' for health marketplace sign-ups
","What botched rollout? That was so 2013. Talking points from President Barack Obama’s advisers are pointing to something new about Obamacare, something that sounds good: About 2.1 million people signed up for health insurance plans through the federal and state marketplaces. NBC’s Meet the Press host David Gregory posed a key follow-up question to Obama economic adviser Gene Sperling during the Jan. 5 show: Is the progress good enough for the administration to meet its original goal? ""2.1 million have signed up. The goal is 7 million by March. How do you think you realistically get there?"" Gregory said. ""Well, first of all, there’s no magic number,"" Sperling said. ""The key is to enroll as many people, have an exchange that’s working, have a stable exchange ..."" ""The secretary of Health and Human Services said that was success, 7 million by March,"" Gregory said. ""I think success is having an ongoing, strong market,"" Sperling said. PolitiFact wanted to know: Is Sperling trying to rewrite the past by saying Obama had ""no magic number"" for the number of people that need to sign up for coverage by the end of open enrollment in March? (We offer a hat-tip to our friend The Fact Checker of the Washington Post, which recently visited this topic after White House health care adviser Phil Schiliro made a similar denial on MSNBC.) The 7 million mark There were at least two times Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, the official Obama appointed to oversee the agency in charge of implementing Obamacare, referred to 7 million as the mark. The number, though, didn’t come from her. The figure originated with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes the impact of legislation. In February 2013, CBO estimated 7 million people would sign up for health insurance through the federal and state marketplaces starting in October through the end of March, the deadline to enroll and avoid a tax penalty. By 2024, enrollment in the marketplaces would be 24 million, CBO said. Sebelius offered cautious optimism about the target for enrollment in a June press briefing and pointed out the sheer size of the risk pool is not the only concern. ""We're hopeful that 7 million is a realistic target and that we're going to be driving our efforts toward that kind of enrollment effort,"" she said. ""And it's both about numbers and also hopefully getting a balanced risk pool."" A Politico story covering her appearance opened with, ""For Obamacare the magic number is 7 million."" A leaked Sept. 5 memo from another high-ranking HHS official, Marilyn Tavenner, to Sebelius outlined the department’s month-by-month projections for enrollment. Drawing on the estimates from CBO, as well as ""the experience of Commonwealth Care in Massachusetts, Medicare Part D, and conversations with employers, issuers and states,"" Tavenner wrote that she expected marketplace enrollment to start at a slow pace but ramp-up in December and March, the months with deadlines. Tavenner’s memo anticipated 3.3 million people to have enrolled by Dec. 31, rising to 7.066 million by March 31. Remember, the estimates and targets from CBO and Tavenner happened before healthcare.gov made its dysfunctional debut. That was not part of the equation. On Sept. 30, the night before the exchanges opened, NBC Nightly News aired an interview with Sebelius in which a reporter asked her, ""What does success look like?"" ""I think success looks like at least 7 million people having signed up by the end of March 2014,"" Sebelius said. The next few weeks were not pretty, to say the least. The online federal marketplace wasn’t ready, with big kinks preventing lots of people from buying plans. Some people, like Wonkblog’s Ezra Klein, argued CBO’s estimates should be tossed because October and November were lost months. The Obama administration considers someone to be ""enrolled"" if they select a plan, not necessarily if they paid for it. Data is not yet available for people who paid a first month’s premium to their insurers. Couching it HHS and White House spokespeople directed us to recent statements by administration officials whose answers about the 7 million goal mirror Sperling’s. For example, senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said on ABC’s This Week on Nov. 3, ""Well, that’s a goal that the CBO said is what they thought would happen. Our goal is to get as many people done as possible."" The position, said HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters, has been the mix of people is more important than the number. She pointed to Sebelius’ June comments and a late November post by Klein, who said White House officials told him as he reported a July story they defined success as ""a function of the mix of people in the exchanges -- the ‘ratio’ -- rather than the number of people in the exchanges."" The administration made plans for a marketing campaign aimed at signing up young adults who tend to be healthier and uninsured. A good health mix in each risk pool is crucial to control costs, and sick people who require more care ""are most likely to sign up and do so early,"" said Gail Wilensky, an expert on the health care law who was the director of Medicaid and Medicare under President George H.W. Bush. At this point, we don’t know much background about the enrollees, such as health and payment status. Obama’s officials are not backtracking so much as they are ""realizing that factors are coming into play that weren’t expected,"" said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University law professor who is an expert on the law. ""I really think it’s still possible by March to get 7 million,"" Jost said, adding that it’s ""meaningless"" that there are not as many people signed up by the end of the year as once projected. Other experts, such as Stan Dorn, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, have been quoted as saying the federal marketplace will function properly even with as low as 2 million enrollees. ""Everyone's been trumpeting this 7 million target,"" Dorn told USA Today. ""I think they can fall well short of it and still be on their way to a very successful program."" Our ruling Sperling denied the administration had a ""magic number"" for how many people it wanted to see enrolled through the exchanges for health insurance coverage. No one knows how many people need to sign up to make the health care law  work. And Sperling has a point that the mix of individuals signing up is likely more important than the raw number. But the Obama administration has used a number -- 7 million by March -- in the past. There’s no denying that. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBEFF00>],/factchecks/2014/jan/05/gene-sperling/obama-economic-adviser-gene-sperling-says-theres-n/
"['LGBTQ', 'Marriage', 'PunditFact', 'Neera Tanden']","
Head of a liberal think tank says 4 in 10 Americans live in states where gay marriage or civil unions are allowed
","There’s no denying 2013 saw a sea change for same-sex couples who sought government recognition of their relationships. Both court decisions and legislative action meant that 10 additional states recognized gay marriage. Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, speculated Dec. 29 on CNN’s State of the Union that changing views toward the gay community will continue in 2014. ""This will be a wedge issue on the Republican side. I mean 10 years ago, we had Republicans pushing a federal marriage amendment in the Senate to ban gay marriage,"" she said. ""Forty percent of the country is going to be in states that are tolerant of gay marriage or at least civil unions. And that number is only going to grow."" We wanted to see if Tanden’s number — that four in 10 Americans now live in states that recognize same-sex marriage or civil unions — is accurate. We contacted the Center for American Progress to see how Tanden reached her number. They pointed us to a year-end round up from the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals. According to the organization, 38.37 percent of the population lives in states that allow same-sex marriage. (Note that this does not include civil unions, which we will address in just a bit.) That figure was released before a federal judge in December overturned a Utah ban on same-sex marriages. In the days since that decision, hundreds of gay and lesbian couples were married in Utah, though the state has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to halt further ceremonies while the ruling is appealed. Adding Utah to the mix, the Human Rights Campaign told PunditFact, would bring the total population living in states that allow gay marriage to 39.27. That was calculated by taking U.S. Census data from 2010 and comparing it with a list of states where same-sex marriage has been legalized, either through the courts or by legislative action. We wanted to double check the math ourselves. Gay marriage is now legal in 18 states — California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont and Washington — plus the District of Columbia, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan advocate for state legislative bodies. Civil unions or domestic partnerships between gay couples are allowed in Colorado, Nevada and Oregon. Using the most recent U.S. Census data estimates from 2013, here’s how the population breaks down in states that allow same-sex marriage or civil unions:  The total is about 43 percent. If you exclude the states that allow civil unions or domestic partnerships but not same-sex marriage, it comes out to about 39.15 percent of the population. By either measure, Tanden appears to be right. We should note that the Illinois General Assembly and the governor last year moved to legalize gay marriage in the state, but licenses won’t be available until June 2014. We also ran these numbers by opponents of same-sex marriage. Tanden’s figure was not disputed by Peter Sprigg, a senior fellow at the Family Research Council. But he said a better measure might be to compare the number of states where voters have approved ballot initiatives in opposition to same-sex marriage against states where residents voted in favor of it. Thirty states have approved constitutional amendments defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Those states make up two-thirds of the population and include California and Utah, where courts overturned voter referendums, and Colorado, Nevada and Oregon, where civil unions are legal. Only Maine, Maryland and Washington have held referendums that approved same-sex marriage laws. (We should point out that most states pass laws through the legislative branch, not via referendum.) Courts also played a heavy role in allowing gay marriage in California, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New Jersey and Utah. During her remarks, Tanden suggested that the number of individuals living in states that allow same sex marriage is ""only going to grow."" As recently as 2010, only seven states recognized gay marriage, comprising just 17 percent of the country. But of the 29 states that don’t allow for same-sex marriages or civil unions, 25 have constitutional amendments that define marriage as between man and a woman. Many of those amendments ""require popular votes, usually alongside legislative action,"" to change them, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. ""Efforts to overturn constitutional prohibitions have begun in several states and litigation has also been initiated in several states"" but the NCSL also notes ""the scope for continued legislative change is limited."" Our ruling Tanden said, ""Forty percent of the country is going to be in states that are tolerant of gay marriage or at least civil unions."" Both expert sources and independently verified statistics back up those numbers if we define ""tolerant"" as states where same-sex marriage or civil unions are legal. Subsequent court decisions could raise or lower that number, and opponents note many of those states allowed same-sex marriage only after court intervention. But at the time she spoke, her statement was accurate, and we rate it True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE25080>],/factchecks/2014/jan/05/neera-tanden/head-liberal-think-tank-says-four-10-americans-liv/
"['New Jersey', 'Jobs', 'Marie Corfield']","
Marie Corfield says New Jersey has highest unemployment rate in region, sluggish job growth
","Marie Corfield may no longer be a candidate for state office, but that doesn’t mean the Democrat is shying away from important Jersey topics.

Take jobs, for example. Corfield, a public school teacher who ran unsuccessfully in November for the District 16 Assembly seat against incumbent Republican Donna Simon, criticized the state of jobs in New Jersey in a Dec. 30 column on the Democratic blog BlueJersey.com. Corfield framed her comments around the departure of the state's comptroller, whom Gov. Chris Christie said was leaving to better support his family. The comptroller's salary was $140,000. Corfield commended the comptroller's accomplishments, adding that the position's salary is a ""comfortable"" one for a family of four in the Garden State. Corfield then called out Christie -- ""the governor of the state with the highest unemployment rate in the region, stagnant job growth"" and a low minimum wage – as pompous, for suggesting that Boxer may have been struggling on such a salary. For this fact check, though, we’re looking only at the claims about New Jersey’s unemployment rate and job growth. First, unemployment rates. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics lists unemployment rates for the nation, each state, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico on its website. We looked at unemployment rates from November – the most recent data available – to see how New Jersey ranked against Connecticut, Delaware, New York and Pennsylvania. New Jersey’s rate was the highest among that group, at 7.8 percent. Here are the others: Connecticut, 7.6 percent; Delaware, 6.5 percent; New York, 7.4 percent; and Pennsylvania, 7.3 percent.
The nation’s unemployment rate for November was 7 percent. So Corfield is correct that New Jersey’s unemployment rate is the highest in the region. It’s worth noting that eight states had unemployment rates higher than New Jersey: California, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, Rhode Island and Tennessee. Arizona’s rate was the same as New Jersey’s. Also, the states are evenly split between Democratic and Republican leadership. Now let’s turn to the claim about ""stagnant"" job growth. Here, Corfield is off base. New Jersey’s unemployment rate barely moved downward for the first half of Christie’s first term in office, but experts have told us that the governor doesn’t bare all the blame. The after-effects of the recession had a lot to do with it, too. The National Bureau of Economic Research has defined the recession as lasting from December 2007 to June 2009. Christie took office in January 2010. 
Although New Jersey’s job growth hasn’t been a race to the top of the economic growth heap, the state has gained new private-sector jobs, particularly in the past year, putting it ""in the middle of the pack"" among other states in terms of job growth, Rutgers University economist Joseph Seneca told us in November. Seneca’s analysis found that the state gained 60,300 private-sector jobs from August 2012 to August 2013. In addition, New Jersey’s job growth rate of 1.8 percent for that time period exceeded that of New York and Connecticut, both with 1.3 percent growth, and Pennsylvania, which had job growth rates of 0.9 percent, Seneca said. Seneca told us that much of the state’s job growth during the period he analyzed was in education, health services, leisure and hospitality, trade, transportation and utilities. It’s important to note that Seneca and the BLS have told us it’s best to measure year-over-year job data that has been seasonally adjusted in order to get the most accurate picture of job growth within a 12-month span.
Using that methodology, New Jersey has increased its number of private-sector jobs by 130,700 from November 2012 to November 2013. There have been some job losses in recent months, but on the whole, the state is gaining private-sector jobs. Corfield said she used the same BLS data as us to determine New Jersey’s unemployment rate, and looked at an analysis on www.governing.com that showed the Garden State excels in giving tax incentives but lags in job growth. She also pointed us to a Wall Street Journal article that address New Jersey’s slow job growth.
Further, Corfield said that while she was out campaigning for an Assembly seat, she spoke with many unhappy and unemployed constituents who ""are having a tough time finding a job."" Our ruling Corfield claimed in a recent column that Christie is ""the governor of the state with the highest unemployment rate in the region, (and) stagnant job growth."" She’s right that the unemployment rate is the highest in this region, but wrong on whether New Jersey’s job growth has been sluggish. BLS data shows clearly that while the Garden State’s unemployment rate is the highest among its neighboring states, it’s not the worst in the country. And it’s also clear from BLS data that private-sector jobs are growing in New Jersey. We rate Corfield’s claim Half True.
