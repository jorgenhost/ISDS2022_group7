Thompson says Baldwin voted to ‘gut’ Medicare
","
As mid-October neared, Republican Tommy Thompson countered charges that he would harm Medicare, and began airing a TV ad alleging that Tammy Baldwin had ""voted to cut Medicare"" for seniors.

Then Thompson’s campaign began trumpeting an amped-up version of that ad, again taking aim at his Democratic rival in the neck-and-neck race for Wisconsin’s open U.S. Senate seat.

""Tammy Baldwin is lying about Tommy Thompson,"" a female narrator says in the tougher ad. ""The truth is, Baldwin voted to gut Medicare for seniors.""

That’s ""gut"" -- as in removing the essential parts -- not ""cut.""

The ad continues with an older woman on screen, saying, ""Tammy Baldwin has no business taking $716 billion out of Medicare."" The narrator adds: ""Baldwin even voted against providing prescription drug benefits to seniors. That plan's architect? Tommy Thompson.""

It’s true Baldwin voted against the Medicare Part D drug program in 2003. And, while we haven’t fact-checked the ""architect"" claim, it’s well-established that Thompson played a key role in winning passage of the drug legislation as Health and Human Services chief for President George W. Bush.

But what about Thompson’s new claim that Baldwin voted to ""gut"" the Medicare program?

The vote cited in the ad is Obama’s signature health care law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Baldwin, a congresswoman since 1999, did join with a strong majority of House Democrats in approving the measure, 219-212, with Republicans unanimously in opposition.

Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicare spending would be slowed, and money saved would help pay for coverage of the uninsured and other initiatives. Originally, it was estimated that the savings would be more than $500 billion; more recently, that has been revised to $716 billion.

PolitiFact has examined multiple claims across the country that Democrats, through their vote for the ""Obamacare"" law, cut money from Medicare.

The ""cut Medicare"" Thompson ad closely mirrors a statement by Mitt Romney, who said on Aug. 15: ""Under the president's plan, he cuts Medicare by $716 billion, takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for ‘Obamacare.’ ""

PolitiFact Florida rated that Half True, because Romney gave the impression ""Obamacare"" takes money already allocated to Medicare. The savings come from spending reductions over the next 10 years that would slow the rate of growth in Medicare’s budget.

But here we are rating Thompson’s other Baldwin ad, which uses a word -- ""gut"" -- that ramps up the claim considerably.

As a frame of reference, in the 2010 Senate race in Wisconsin we reviewed Republican candidate (and now Senator) Ron Johnson’s claim that then-Sen. Russ Feingold, a Democrat, ""cut Medicare by $523 billion."" (Again, that was the earlier estimate of Obamacare’s spending-reduction plan.)

We rated that Mostly False, noting that Medicare spending would still increase, and that Johnson’s additional claim that Feingold was the deciding vote could be made against every incumbent senator who voted for the health care law.

Thompson’s claim, by contrast, is ""gut.""

We approached the Thompson campaign to back up the ad’s claim.

They pointed us to Congressional Budget Office memos, and a report by Medicare’s actuary, to refute claims by the Obama campaign that his health care law strengthened the delicate financial position of Medicare. The documentation does confirm that if Obamacare was repealed, more money would be available to spend on Medicare.

But we also asked two federal budget experts from nonpartisan groups to assess the ad’s use of ""gut."" Both said it was solidly off the mark.

""Medicare will continue to grow in nominal dollars and faster than the overall economy,"" said Jason Peuquet, research director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The cost savings in the health law, in Peuquet’s view, actually don’t go far enough to tackle Medicare’s long-term fiscal stability.

One way to look at it, he said, is that over 10 years, Medicare under Obamacare is projected to grow about 10 percent less than it would have. Even with the slower growth, net Medicare spending is still projected to rise from $504 billion to $877 billion over that period, CBO estimates show. Total projected Medicare spending goes from $598 billion to $1.04 trillion.

Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, told us that ""regardless of whether you think these are good or bad reforms, ‘gutting’ a program would require far deeper cuts than Obamacare/ACA included.""

We’ve tackled a claim of ""gutting"" a government program before.

Democratic U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin accused Gov. Scott Walker of ""gutting"" two tax credits for the poor or elderly. In rating that False in May 2012, we said that while the percentage cut was deep in one of the credits, Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature left them largely intact. Even advocates for the credits said ""gutting"" went too far.

Impact on Medicare

To be sure, serious health-care experts have raised concerns that health-care access for seniors could be reduced if Obamacare’s cut in the growth of Medicare payments to providers discourages them from accepting Medicare patients. Prediction is difficult, as the Office of the Actuary for Medicare and Medicaid Services said while raising the concern in April 2010.

In addition, the law tries to save costs on Medicare Advantage, an optional Medicare program run by private insurers. As federal subsidies to Advantage are reduced, recipients could see higher premiums, or lose of some extras like free eyeglasses and gym memberships, we have noted in the past.

So it’s likely that some reduction in services will result from the health care law.

On the other hand, the Thompson campaign did not mention that the health care law actually adds new services: It gradually closes the gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage known as the ""doughnut hole,"" funds illness prevention benefits, and seeks to boost access to primary care doctors and other providers.

Finally, we should also note an important bit of context left out of the ad.

Vice presidential nominee Ryan’s budget plan -- backed by Thompson -- included the same amount of reductions in future Medicare spending that were part of  ""Obamacare, ""PolitiFact National has noted. Ryan said he would keep the savings for future Medicare expenses, not to support the new federal health-care law.

Our ruling

Thompson’s new ad says the truth is that ""Baldwin voted to gut Medicare for seniors"" when she backed the health reform law’s cost-containment measures in the Medicare program.

This is off base or misleading on several fronts.

The health care law slows Medicare’s growth but spending would still rise significantly, and some new services are added.

The changes do not promise to hold seniors harmless, but Medicare is not being gutted.

We rate the claim False.

Providence crime rates during the David Cicilline administration - revisited
","With U.S. Rep. David Cicilline coming under fire for his work as a defense attorney, the Democrat has been fighting back by saying that, during his tenure as mayor of Providence, the city logged the lowest crime rate in three decades.

""I'm very proud that while I was mayor of the city of Providence we had the lowest crime rate in 30 years,"" Cicilline said during his Oct. 16 debate against Republican Brendan Doherty, the former superintendent of the Rhode Island State Police.

Cicilline talked about the crime statistics at least three times during the WPRI - Providence Journal faceoff.

At the time PolitiFact Rhode Island first looked at the issue -- in 2010 when Cicilline first ran for Congress -- data were only available through 2009. We rated his statement as True because it was factually correct.

Since then, PolitiFact national and its affiliates have begun looking at such statements with a focus on whether the implied cause and effect is fair and accurate. With that perspective, we decided to reexamine Cicilline’s claim and to include the statistics for 2010, Cicilline's last year as mayor.

To recap, in 2010 we looked at data collected by the Providence Police Department on various crimes going back to 1960 and focused on the sum of all reports of murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft, which the police call the ""crime index.""

For 2009, the last year available at the time, there were 9,252 such crimes reported in Providence, according to police. That was the lowest number since 1965, 44 years earlier.

Last week, we asked the Police Department for more recent figures.

Meanwhile, we got Providence data from the FBI website. So we'll use that for now.

There's one big caveat to this. The FBI and the city classify crimes a bit differently. As a result, in recent years Providence has invariably reported more crime incidents than the FBI lists on its website, even though Providence is the source of both numbers. In other words, the FBI numbers make Providence look better than the city's own numbers do. However, the trends are similar.

The FBI numbers say the Providence crime index in 2009 was 9,173, or 79 fewer than the city reported.

Going forward to 2010, the FBI says the number rose to 9,472, an increase of 299 incidents or 3.3 percent.

However, Cicilline talked about ""crime rate,"" which is the number of reported crimes for the population. Because Providence's population went up in 2010, the crime rate in 2010 was 53.2 incidents per 1,000 people, which is lower than the year before and the lowest of any year during the Cicilline administration.

(We've put the FBI statistics on a spreadsheet that can be downloaded from www.scribd.com/politifactri.) When we received Providence police's updated data, we found that the statistics for the Cicilline administration had shifted, which can happen from year to year because categories can shift, such as when an assault becomes a murder.

(In two of the years, the shifts were dramatic. The new numbers were 7.7 percent lower for 2005 and 4.2 percent lower for 2007. We asked for an explanation for the discrepancies, but haven’t received a response from the department.)

But even with those numbers, the trend remains the same, with the crime index reaching a nadir in 2009 and the number of crimes rising a bit in 2010.

Looking at the broader picture, Cicilline's comments at the Oct. 16 debate suggest that he and his administration were responsible for the decline, and it was clear from when we first did the story that officials think initiatives such as community policing played a role.

However, the drop in overall Providence crime came at a time that crime was dropping nationally for a variety of reasons, including the aging of the population. Thus, the evidence is muddled.

One thing that argues in Cicilline's favor is the fact that the decline in the Providence crime rate was steeper than the national decline during the early years of his administration. However, that decline seemed to have leveled off during his final three years in office.

Our Ruling

David Cicilline said that, ""While I was mayor of the city of Providence we had the lowest crime rate in 30 years.""

That's actually an understatement. The 2009 rate was the lowest in Providence in four decades. The rate went down just a bit more in 2010 because a population increase in Providence washed out an increase in the actual number of reported crimes.

The downward trend in Providence coincides with a national decline in the rate of serious crimes, but the decline in the early years of his administration was steeper than the national average.

Cicilline and the Providence Police Department may have played a significant role in bringing the numbers down as well, but the scope of that effect is impossible to quantify with any certainty.

Nonetheless, the evidence is strong enough for the judges to rate Cicilline's statement True.

"['Oregon', 'Taxes', 'Creative Advocacy Network']","
Would a Portland arts tax put an art or music teacher in every elementary school?
","
The proposed Portland tax for the arts is nothing if not divisive. Supporters say the tax will mean having arts educators in every city elementary school, as well as better access to the arts throughout Portland. Detractors have called the tax poorly structured and say it uses children as a front for a plan to move money into already well-established institutions.

The $35-a-person tax, which would collect some $12 million, actually goes to two different areas. About 70 percent of the money would be distributed to Portland-area school districts to help hire art and music teachers and to K-12 arts programs. The remaining funds would go to the Regional Arts and Culture Council for distribution among Portland arts organizations, such as the Oregon Symphony and the Portland Art Museum, which would use the money to offer publicly accessible art programming.

To be sure, the money for schools seems to be the political campaign's primary selling point.

On its website, the pro-tax Schools and Arts Together says the tax would ""restore arts and music education in Portland's six school districts by providing stable, long-term funding for certified arts and music teachers for every elementary school serving Portland residents.""

And Jessica Jarrat Miller, executive director of the Creative Advocacy Network, which proposed the tax, asserted something similar during a September radio interview: ""If we pass this measure, we will be able to fund teachers to make sure that every elementary school in our city has certified art instruction.""

And yet, a recent article in Willamette Week partly challenged that assertion. The weekly quoted former Emily Nazarov, the Portland organizer of Stand for Children, as saying the organization had ""some serious concerns whether the measure will deliver on its promise of music and art teachers in every school.""

PolitiFact Oregon decided to check.

Under the measure and an associated inter-governmental agreement, each district would get funding for one art or music teacher for every 500 elementary students. In return, the district agrees to have one full-time art or music teacher in each elementary school.

That works fine for the David Douglas School District.

Dan McCue, the spokesman for the district, told us that David Douglas has nine eligible elementary schools -- and would get enough money for nine art or music teachers. As it stands now, each of the elementary schools already has a full-time music teacher, so the art tax money ""would be used to preserve those positions.""

But the formula falls apart if a district has some schools that are smaller than 500 students.

Consider Portland Public Schools, the largest of the Portland districts. The district has 58 elementary schools -- but according to the 500-student formula, would receive funding for only 44 or 45 full-time positions.

That means, should the tax pass, the district would have to find the money for the additional 13 or 14 teachers.

We spoke with David Wynde, the district's deputy chief financial officer, to see if we understood the situation correctly. He confirmed we did. That would still represent some relief for the budget, he said. This year, PPS is funding 32 full-time arts or music positions.

We called Jarrat Miller to see if she could explain how the tax would restore ""arts for every Portland elementary school,"" as one mailer put it, if some districts were actually pitching in supplemental cash?

""It's been widely misrepresented and confused,"" Jarrat Miller said. For Portland Public, she said, it's true that the tax would only provide 44 or 45 full-time teaching positions. It's equally true that, at least for the first year, PPS has agreed to pay for 13 additional full-time art or music teachers to make sure that every school has at least one.

However, she said, the inter-governmental agreement – though not finalized – has been revised to say that if the district faces a financial hardship, the city of Portland would figure out a way to avoid cutting off the money.

The bottom line, Jarrat Miller said, is that ""nobody is forcing the district to do anything they can't do."" In the event that Portland Public Schools had no money to commit to art instruction, the 45 teachers would still be more than the district is currently providing, she said. Those teachers would likely split their time among all 58 elementary schools. While 58 teachers is better, 45 would be enough to give all students art or music education once a week. The 500-to-one ratio, for what it's worth, was selected based on national student-teacher-ratio averages.

""It's not a whole body that matters; it's how much education the kids are getting... that's what the ballot measure insists on,"" Jarrat Miller said.

Wynde, the Portland Public financial officer, said he believed the additional language provided the district with the flexibility to renegotiate if funding becomes unstable.

Nazarov, the local organizer for Stand for Children, seemed slightly less convinced. She said the organization was pleased that the inter-governmental agreement had been amended but thought the languageshould be more explicit in protecting the money.

School and Arts Together has said that the arts tax would provide ""funding for certified arts and music teachers for every elementary school serving Portland residents."" It does accomplish this goal; however there are some important details that are missing –perhaps most glaringly, this idea that some districts would have to kick in money to ensure that each school has a full-time art or music teacher.

Now, it's true that, in the case of financial hardship, this part of the measure could be renegotiated. But it's not clear what defines financial hardship or how those negotiations would take place -- and the inter-governmental agreement is still being drafted. Even if we assume that the funding would continue, it wouldn't be a full-time teacher in each school. We agree that it's not the body that matters so much as the amount of instructional time. But we also feel that most people voting on this tax imagine that, with it, districts would be getting enough cash to put a full-time art or music teacher in each elementary school – and that's not necessarily the case.

We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967F0980>],/factchecks/2012/oct/19/creative-advocacy-network/would-portland-arts-tax-put-art-or-music-teacher-e/

Nelson ties Mack to 'forcible rape' measure
","
The allegiance of female voters was in play during Wednesday’s U.S. Senate debate. Sen. Bill Nelson attacked U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers, for his views on violence against women.

""Mack voted to redefine rape as forcible rape,"" Nelson said. ""So I think it's pretty clear where he is standing on women's issues.""

Mack shot back: ""What he just said is not true, and we cannot let it stand. Senator, you need to do a better job of explaining your own record, because you're really messing up my record.""

We are checking whether Nelson got it right. Did Mack vote to define rape as forcible rape?

Federal funding for abortion

Nelson based his claim on the role Mack played in co-sponsoring a House bill that aimed to block any possible way that federal dollars might underwrite the cost of an abortion. For many years, lawmakers have barred the use of money for abortion through the Medicaid program and at military hospitals and in other programs. There are long-standing exceptions, though, for rape, incest or the life of the mother.

This bill Mack co-sponsored, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, sought to restrict abortion even further. It said medical bills related to an abortion would not qualify as a health expense when people file their income taxes. It blocked any federal subsidy for insurance policies that include abortion services.

The bill’s most controversial clause, though, focused on rape. It added an important qualification to the traditional exception: The new language said federal funds could only be used in cases of  ""forcible rape.""

The bill never defined the term ""forcible,"" and it drew a wave of criticism. Women’s organizations accused the bill’s sponsors of trying to redefine rape. They said rape by its very nature is an act of force. They questioned whether the new term would exclude cases when the victim is unconscious due to alcohol or drugs, or cases of statutory rape. (Statutory rape includes consensual sexual relations when an individual is not old enough to legally consent.)

The controversy led Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee to drop the word ""forcible."" The bill then passed in the House but was never taken up by the Senate.

So the main purpose of the legislation was not redefining rape, but limiting the use of federal funds to pay for abortion.

Vote vs. co-sponsoring

The version of the bill that Mack voted on did not have the clause on forcible rape. When Nelson claimed that Mack had voted for that measure, he was wrong.

""The senator misspoke,"" said Dan McLaughlin, Nelson’s communications director. ""He knew that Mack was a co-sponsor, but it came out wrong.""

Indeed, Mack co-sponsored the bill on January 24, 2011, four days after it was introduced. Mack put his name behind the bill long before the forcible rape language was removed.

Still, the forcible rape language has become an issue in this year’s campaign. Paul Ryan, the vice presidential nominee who also was a co-sponsor of the bill, answered questions from Fox News about the matter on Aug. 27, 2012.

""Well, look, all these bills were bills to stop taxpayer financing of abortion,"" Ryan said. ""Most Americans agree with us, including pro-choice Americans that we shouldn't use hard-working taxpayer dollars to finance abortion. Rape is rape period.

""This is language, stock language used for lots of different bills, bills I didn't author. And that language was removed to be very clear, and I agree with that, removing that language, so we are very clear. Rape is rape. Period. End of story.""

So that’s how Ryan felt about the matter, but what about Mack?

We asked the Mack campaign several times how he felt about the ""forcible rape"" language but did not receive a response. So we don’t know whether Mack supported removing the wording or not. (Editor's note: After we published this report, we received a comment from the Mack campaign. We have included it below our ruling.)

Our ruling

Nelson said that Mack voted to redefine rape as forcible rape.

The bill in question was intended to limit federal funding for abortion. As part of that, the bill did originally aim to limit that funding from ""rape"" to cases of ""forcible rape."" Redefining rape, though, was not its primary purpose. And, this part of the bill was so controversial it was struck from the bill before it came to a vote. So Nelson was wrong to say Mack voted on the language.

Still, Mack was an early co-sponsor when the bill did include language on forcible rape. We asked the Mack campaign multiple times if Mack supported or opposed the removal of that language. We did not receive a response. So we don’t know if Mack supported or opposed removal of the language that was in the bill when he co-sponsored it.

We rate the statement Half True. 
Editor's note: After we published this report, the Mack campaign provided us with this response: ""Congressman Mack strongly supported the removal of the term 'forcible' rape from the bill before it came up for consideration. Congressman Mack was one of 227 house co-sponsors on the bill which had the primary intent of providing greater protections against the use of federal taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions.""",[<zip object at 0x000002809A45B1C0>],/factchecks/2012/oct/19/bill-nelson/nelson-ties-mack-forcible-rape-measure/

Planned Parenthood says Mitt Romney and George Allen 'would overturn Roe v. Wade and allow states to end safe, legal abortion'
","
Abortion rights are at risk state by state with Republicans in charge, according to a new mailing from a super PAC affiliated with Planned Parenthood.

The mailer, which targets female voters in Richmond and Northern Virginia, says presidential candidate Mitt Romney and U.S. Senate candidate George Allen would ""overturn Roe v. Wade.""

That would ""allow states to end safe, legal abortion even in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is at risk,"" the ad says.

Romney and Allen have both gone on record as opposed to abortion except in cases of rape, incest and when necessary to save the mother’s life.

But this mailer didn’t claim they opposed abortion in all cases. Instead, it said the end of Roe vs. Wade would allow states to pass such blanket bans. Justices ruled in the 1973 case that a woman has a qualified constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy. Nearly 40 years later, that means states can’t enforce laws that represent an ""undue burden"" on women seeking an abortion.

We wondered, would Romney and Allen overturn Roe vs. Wade? And would that allow states to end abortion?

 Romney and Allen on ‘Roe’

First we’ve got to state the obvious: neither a president nor a senator can overturn a Supreme Court decision.

But a president could appoint a justice interested in revisiting the issues raised in Roe, and a senator could vote to confirm such an nominee. (The New York Times and Atlantic, among others, have written about the 2012 election’s possible effect on the makeup of the court.)

If a spot opened on the aging court, does that reflect what Romney and Allen have said they would do? Essentially, yes.

Romney’s ever-shifting stances on abortion can be tough to pin down — the same week this mailer emerged, he said there wasn’t any antiabortion legislation on his agenda, then his spokeswoman said that of course he would support such legislation.

(And when he ran for office in liberal Massachusetts, he said he supported a ""woman's right to choose."")

But on the question of Roe vs. Wade, his campaign website is clear. He wants it overturned: 
He also said on Meet the Press on Sept. 9, 2012, that he would ""appoint justices for the Supreme Court that will follow the law and the constitution. And it would be my preference that they reverse Roe v. Wade and therefore they return to the people and their elected representatives the decisions with regards to this important issue.""
 
Now, Allen.

His website says his ""commitment to protecting innocent human life is firm"" and that he opposes abortion ""except in the rare cases where the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest, and when necessary to save the life of the mother."" It doesn’t mention Roe vs. Wade.

Planned Parenthood pointed us to his 2003 vote against the Harkin Amendment, which asked U.S. senators to affirm that the decision ""should not be overturned.""

Meanwhile, his website argues that ""his record on life issues is strong,"" noting that it earned him a 100 percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee when he was in the Senate, among other accomplishments.

Allen’s campaign didn’t respond to our request to confirm whether he’s interested in an overturn of Roe, but the evidence is strong he would vote to confirm an anti-Roe nominee for the court if given the opportunity.

 A new Supreme Court justice

Still, there’s no guarantee Romney would have a chance to replace a justice who supports Roe.

Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg are in their 70s, but wouldn’t voluntarily step aside under a Republican president, say court-watchers such as ScotusBlog publisher Tom Goldstein and CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.

There’s no guarantee that Allen would be part of a Senate majority that would vote to confirm an anti-Roe justice. The chamber is up for grabs in the election, with more than 50 seats needed for a majority. We can say a win for Allen would put Republicans closer to overtaking the Senate:  Virginia, a tossup state, is voting to replace retiring Democrat Jim Webb.

There’s also no guarantee a newly reshuffled court would push to fully overturn Roe, returning the issue to states — though there’s no shortage of predictions it would, including from Toobin. But even the current court’s take on Roe vs. Wade hasn’t been well tested.

""We don't know enough, because we haven't had much in the way of abortion cases since (Chief Justice John) Roberts and (Samuel) Alito joined the court,"" said Goldstein, who has argued 25 cases before the court. ""... We don't know if the court is currently ready or would be ready with one more vote to overturn it.""

More likely, perhaps, would be a reinterpretation of ""undue burden"" that was far more narrow, allowing a wider range of state restrictions on abortion.

 States after ‘Roe’

But let’s assume, for the sake of argument, Romney gets to nominate an anti-Roe justice, Allen votes along with a majority of fellow senators to confirm that nomination, and a more conservative court picks a case that allows it to completely overturn Roe vs. Wade.

Would that ""allow states to end safe, legal abortion even in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is at risk""?

Well, yes, but that’s unlikely to be the most common result.

New limits on abortion, however, would be likely.

The Center for Reproductive Rights found in 2004 that 30 states ""were poised to criminalize abortion soon after a Roe reversal.""

The Guttmacher Institute, which works to  ""advance sexual and reproductive health and rights,"" keeps an updated fact-sheet called, ""Abortion Policy in the Absence of Roe.""

This month, it showed that 20 states already have laws that could be used to restrict the legal status of abortion, from those that automatically ban abortion if Roe were overturned to laws that express intent to restrict the right to legal abortion ""to the maximum extent permitted"" by the court.

But seven states have laws that protect the right to choose abortion ""prior to viability or when necessary to protect the life or health of the woman.""

""A categorical ban, I think, would be quite rare,"" Goldstein said.

Still, an overturned Roe would theoretically ""allow"" states to ban abortion without exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother, as the Planned Parenthood ad claims — whether they actually implemented such laws or not.

So, let’s reprise the ""ifs"":

• If Romney and Allen win and

• If Romney gets the chance to replace a liberal justice and

• If Allen and other senators confirm a justice who supports overturning Roe and

• If that new justice creates a majority on the court willing to revisit Roe and

• If there’s an appropriate case for the Supreme Court to review and

• If the court decides to fully overturn Roe, returning abortion regulations to the states

Then a state legislature could vote to ""end safe, legal abortion even in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is at risk.""

 Our ruling

A Planned Parenthood mailer in Virginia claims that ""(Mitt) Romney and (George) Allen would overturn Roe v. Wade and allow states to end safe, legal abortion even in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is at risk."" A president and a senator don’t have the power to directly overturn a Supreme Court decision, but they could nominate and vote for an anti-Roe justice if a spot opened.

Meanwhile, there’s no guarantee that a reshuffled court would fully overturn the decision, as opposed to further limiting a woman’s right to choose, but preserving protection in cases of rape, incest or risk to a woman's life. The ad says Romney and Allen ""would."" We suppose they would if they could — but whether they could is substantially more speculative than the ad suggests.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Voting Record', 'Florida', 'Connie Mack']","
Connie Mack says his career voting participation is on par with that of Bill Nelson
","
U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers, has been the target of attacks for missing votes while campaigning for Senate this year.

In a debate against his Democratic opponent Sen. Bill Nelson on Oct. 17, 2012, Mack defended himself by saying that his career voting record was on par with Nelson’s.  Mack started in Congress in 2005, while Nelson served in the House between 1979 and 1990 and then joined the Senate in 2001.

Here’s what they said at the debate:

Nelson: ""Speaking of votes why don’t you explain how you don’t show up to work? Why don’t you explain how this year you have one of the worst voting records. I have missed one vote this year. You have missed 178....""

Mack: ""As far as my voting record, Senator, you should be straight with people. I’ve got a 94 percent voting record.  You’ve got a 92 percent voting record.""

We will fact-check Mack’s claim that he’s got ""a 94 percent voting record"" for his career in Congress, while Bill Nelson has ""a 92 percent voting record.""

Missed votes in 2012

This fight over voting records started earlier in the debate when Nelson claimed that he only missed one vote while Mack missed 178, which meant he has ""one of the worst voting records."" We ruled that claim Mostly True; we’ll briefly recap our findings.

GovTrack.us tracks missed votes for members of Congress using voting information from the official websites of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. It shows that for the first three quarters of this year, Mack missed 178 votes. Nelson’s one missed vote this year was to confirm the nomination of a federal judge in Illinois, which passed 86-1 on May 14.

Mack’s missed votes for this year put him in 13th place for members of Congress who have missed the most votes during the past two years, according to the New York Times’ Inside Congress database.

But it’s no surprise that Mack missed more votes than Nelson this year. While Nelson had token primary opposition, Mack faced serious primary challengers.

In July, Mack campaign spokesman David James said that Mack missed votes ""to make sure Mitt Romney won the Florida presidential primary in January, something Connie's constituents felt very strongly about when it comes to invoking the change we need in Washington.""

Missed votes throughout career

Looking at sheer vote numbers isn’t an apples-to-apples comparison because the House takes more votes than the Senate.

So we also looked at the percentage of missed votes for Mack’s tenure and Nelson’s Senate tenure.

From the start of Mack’s tenure in January 2005, he missed 6 percent of roll call votes -- that’s how Mack can claim that he has a 94 percent voting record. During Nelson’s Senate tenure starting in January 2001, he missed 1 percent. The median missed votes for all members was 2.5 percent.

But Mack’s claim that Nelson had a 92 percent voting record -- or missed 8 percent of votes  -- refers to his term in the House (1979-1990) plus his term in the Senate starting in 2001.

Here’s why Mack likes to throw in those earlier years for Nelson: When Nelson campaigned for governor in 1990, he missed 56 percent of his votes.

Mack campaign consultant Gary Maloney sent us a spreadsheet showing Nelson’s missed votes and his voting participation rate each year based on Congressional Quarterly data. According to that data, Nelson participated about 92 percent of the time.

We contacted CQ directly, and they could not immediately verify the raw number of votes but did provide the percentage of missed votes each year, and that averaged out to about 92 percent, too. (Note that averaging the percentage each year isn’t a true average, because the total number of votes changed each year, but it likely provides a close approximation.)

We sent our findings to the Nelson campaign and they did not dispute the numbers. 
Our ruling

Mack said that his own career voting participation rate is 94 percent, while Nelson’s is 92 percent. The available data supports those numbers.

Both candidates have political reasons for times when they missed votes: Nelson missed more than half of his votes in 1990 when he ran for governor. Mack missed about 30 percent so far this year running for Senate.

So while Nelson criticized Mack for missed votes this year, Nelson has also missed votes in the past, and their career voting rates are roughly equivalent. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097885D80>],/factchecks/2012/oct/19/connie-mack/connie-mack-says-his-career-voting-participation-p/

Barack Obama says George W. Bush never sought to defund Planned Parenthood
","
During a town hall presidential debate in which audience members got to ask the questions, one woman asked Mitt Romney how he would differ from the last Republican to occupy the White House: George W. Bush.

""Since both you and President Bush are Republicans, I fear a return to the policies of those years should you win this election,"" said undecided voter Susan Katz. ""What is the biggest difference between you and George W. Bush, and how do you differentiate yourself from George W. Bush?""

Romney detailed several ways he would depart from Bush’s policies, then President Barack Obama chimed in, saying Romney was actually further to the right than Bush.

""George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Gov. Romney and George Bush,"" Obama said, as one example.

Planned Parenthood provides low-cost reproductive health services but is also the nation’s leading provider of abortions. Romney and other Republicans have vowed to eliminate its federal funding, a move Obama opposes.

But where did the 43rd president stand on the subject? We decided to check it out.

Planned Parenthood and federal funding

The organization, founded in 1921, has received federal funds since 1970, when President Richard Nixon signed a law amending the Public Health Service Act. Title X of that law provides funding for family planning services, including contraception and family planning information.

Planned Parenthood now operates more than 800 clinics in all 50 states. The bulk of their work is women’s health care: cancer screenings, STD treatment, sex education, contraceptives, pregnancy care and breast exams. In many states, they also perform abortions -- more than 330,000 a year. The group receives millions in federal money every year, in the form of grants and reimbursements for the health services its provides. In 2009, its federal funding totalled $360 million. Planned Parenthood says abortions account for 3 percent of its services, which are prohibited from being paid for with public money. The group says it is careful to keep the money separate.

Still, it’s that 3 percent that makes it a target in the national abortion battle.

What Bush did

In one of his first acts as president, Bush reinstated what is known as the Mexico City policy, or (as abortion rights advocates called it) the global gag rule, in January 2001. The rule denies money to overseas family planning clinics (such as Planned Parenthood’s international arm) that provide abortion counseling in foreign countries. 

At the end of Bush’s term, International Planned Parenthood Federation said that during those eight years, they lost more than $100 million for family planning and health programs. The consequence of losing those funds, the group said: 36 million unplanned pregnancies and 15 million induced abortions.

When Obama took office, he revoked the Mexico City policy.

What Bush didn’t do

As president, Bush called himself a ""compassionate conservative"" and spoke of supporting ""a culture of life."" He steered money to faith-based groups, and he signed a federal ban on late-term abortions in 2003. When he ran for re-election in 2004, Planned Parenthood endorsed Democrat John Kerry, the first time the group formally backed a presidential candidate.

That said, we searched media reports from Bush’s eight years in office and found no instances of the president pushing to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood’s work in the United States. We contacted Planned Parenthood itself, which also couldn’t cite evidence of Bush targeting their federal money.

On the contrary, we found ample evidence that Bush was satisfied with the status quo. In 1999, when he was first running for president, he declined to sign a pledge to defund Planned Parenthood, saying he supported ""incremental changes helpful to America's pro-life movement.""

The Obama campaign also pointed us to information on Title X funding (which pays for the health services Planned Parenthood provides) during the Bush years.

His 2002 budget proposal eliminated contraceptive coverage for federal employees but maintained funding for Title X, including $66 million for Planned Parenthood. A budget bill he signed in 2007 provided ""the largest increase in Title X family planning funding since 2000, a $16.8 million increase from the previous year,"" according to a Planned Parenthood press release.

Romney’s stance

Eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood has gotten more attention since a Republican majority, backed by the new tea party wave of conservatism, took control of the House of Representatives in 2011.

""This is when we're going to defund Planned Parenthood. Now is the season for us to do this,"" Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., said in February 2011. (Stearns later lost his primary battle to a more ardent tea party candidate.)

The House voted in February 2011 to block Planned Parenthood funding, and all money for family planning. (The Democrat-controlled Senate rejected the package.) The message also caught on in the Republican presidential primary contest. Newt Gingrich, at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition dinner that same month, said, ""I would immediately move to defund Planned Parenthood and take that money and devote it to adoption services to create an alternative to abortion.""

Romney, for his part, has repeatedly pledged to revoke Planned Parenthood’s funding. His website says he would ""eliminate Title X Family Planning Funding — Savings: $300 Million. Title X subsidizes family planning programs that benefit abortion groups like Planned Parenthood.""

And after he told the Des Moines Register on Oct. 9, 2012, that there’s no abortion legislation on his agenda, he was forced to re-state his anti-abortion stance: ""The actions I’ll take immediately is to remove funding for Planned Parenthood. It will not be part of my budget. And also I’ve indicated that I will reverse the Mexico City position of the president.""

With the spotlight on the organization, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards told the Washington Post in August, ""I’ve never seen anything like this. I’ve never seen a presidential election where women’s basic access to birth control is practically on the ballot. Defunding Planned Parenthood is practically on the ballot. It’s been incredible to witness the last year and a half and this debate we’ve had over access to care. ... This is not something that John McCain was campaigning to do. George Bush wasn’t either. I’ve never seen anything quite like it.""

Our ruling

Obama said in the debate that, ""George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood.""

In fact, one of Bush’s first acts as president was to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood and other groups working overseas that counsel women about abortion. But as for eliminating Title X funding for health services that Planned Parenthood provides in the United States -- which is what Romney and other Republicans of today favor -- Obama is right. We found no evidence that Bush sought such a change, and Title X funding actually increased during his presidency.

We rate Obama’s statement Mostly True.

Linda McMahon says opponent Chris Murphy 'was raking in $1 million in salary' in Congress
","
In an ad in the hard-fought U.S. Senate race in Connecticut, Republican Linda McMahon charges that her Democratic opponent, Rep. Chris Murphy, has been getting rich in Congress.

The ad focuses on Social Security and Medicare, but it includes a momentary detour into how much Murphy got paid for his labors in the Capitol.

The narrator asks, ""Why is Congressman Chris Murphy lying to you about Linda McMahon and Social Security? Because while Murphy was raking in $1 million in salary, he voted to cut Medicare for current recipients by $716 billion.""

An on-screen visual reads: ""Congressman Chris Murphy: $1 million in taxpayer-funded salary.""

A reader asked us: Are members of Congress really paid $1 million salaries?

Actually, no. Not even close.

Since Jan. 1, 2009, lawmakers have been paid $174,000 a year. The key to understanding the ad’s claim comes from the fine print on the screen. It says, ""Congressional salaries 2007 through 2012.""

So the ad is referring to Murphy’s cumulative earnings over a six-year period and calling it his ""salary.""

We checked a Congressional Research Service paper on lawmakers’ salaries and found that if you add up the salary earned by Murphy over the six-year period since he was elected to Congress, it does come to more than $1.03 million.

""He’s been in Congress six years, and he’s cumulatively been paid $1 million dollars,"" said Todd Abrajano, communications director for the McMahon campaign.  ""It’s pretty clear and straightforward.""

But in our view, that’s a ridiculous way of calculating ""salary,"" which is defined as ""a fixed regular payment, typically paid on a monthly or biweekly basis but often expressed as an annual sum.""

The tremendous distortion of this claim is that it adds up multiple years and uses a terminology that suggests it is for one year.

Using their logic, we would say the median household income in the United States is more than $300,000. (The median household earned just over $50,000 in 2011, according to the Census Bureau.)

Our ruling

The method for calculating Murphy’s salary was disclosed on the screen, but it is in such small type -- and it was calculated in such an unorthodox way -- that the explanation is greatly outweighed by the narration and the visuals.

We’ve never heard of anyone refer to their ""salary"" as six cumulative years of earnings. By phrasing it this way, the ad is pulling a fast one. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DB6DC0>],/factchecks/2012/oct/19/linda-mcmahon/linda-mcmahon-says-opponent-chris-murphy-was-rakin/
"['Education', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says less than 30 percent of Texas college students graduate in four years, only 58 percent in six years
","
Rick Perry, who has said he wants the 2013 Legislature to impose a four-year tuition freeze for incoming freshmen, said at a Dallas press conference that such a move would give students an economic incentive to graduate on time.

""Less than 30 percent of our students graduate in four years; only 58 percent of our students have their degrees in six years,"" Perry said, according to an Oct. 2, 2012, Dallas Morning News news story. ""That is a system that can and must be improved.""

He aired a similar claim in a CBS News interview Oct. 10, 2012, saying: ""One of the problems we’ve got is that only 30 percent of our college students are graduating in a four-year period of time.""

We previously explored a similar claim by state Rep. Scott Hochberg, D-Houston, who said in June 2010 that about a third of Texas high school graduates who go to college end up ""getting through"" college. His statement rated True; our look also quoted an official from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board pointing out that 57 percent of Texas students were graduating within six years.

Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said the Republican governor drew his figures from the board, and a board spokesman, Dominic Chavez, guided us to the agency’s 2012 ""Higher Education Almanac.""

A chart in the report says 29.9 percent of Texas students who initially enrolled as full-time students in the state’s four-year public colleges and universities graduated within four years. It says 58.4 percent of full-time students graduated within six years, with 65.6 percent doing so within 10 years. Fewer part-time students graduated within the time periods.

Chavez said by email that the four-year graduation rate of nearly 30 percent reflects 18,396 graduates out of 61,485 full-time students in the fiscal year running through August 2011 who had enrolled as first-time students four years earlier. Notably, he said, the state can track students who switch schools by tracking them using Social Security numbers or another identifier.

And the 30 percent rate reflects improvement from the previous decade, Chavez said. By the same measure, nearly 20 percent of fourth-year undergraduates had graduated by August 2000, a rate based on 8,352 graduates among 41,925 fourth-year students.

""Not only did rate go up,"" he said, ""but the number of students increased as well.""

As noted in our check of Hochberg’s statement, two caveats apply. First, the data don’t account for students who enrolled in a Texas institution and then transferred out of state. Second, while the enrollment data include students who attended school out of state, the data don’t track whether they graduated.

Separately, the U.S. Department of Education also gauges college graduation rates by state. In 2009, its latest figures indicate, 48.5 percent of Texas students who had enrolled six years earlier had earned bachelor’s degrees, compared with 55.5 percent nationally.

The same year, 25.4 percent of Texas students who had enrolled three years earlier seeking community college associate’s degrees had succeeded, compared with 29.2 percent nationally. Based on the raw numbers behind each rate, we reached a combined graduation rate of 38 percent.

In contrast to the Texas board’s calculation, the federal figures do not account for students who transferred from one institution to another.

We asked Patrick Kelly, who works for the agency that oversees the federal graduation figures, to appraise the Texas board’s method of calculating graduation rates. ""This makes sense,"" he said, calling the approach a straightforward, standard way of tracking students including those who change schools.

Our ruling

Perry said fewer than 30 percent of Texas college students graduate in four years and only 58 percent graduate within six years. That information is drawn from the state’s higher education oversight agency.

Austin resident says University of Texas has $7 billion endowment and football team had a $50 million profit, so it can afford to pay for local medical school
","
Rob Moshein of Austin says he favors a local University of Texas medical school but will vote against a proposed tax increase pitched as vital to fulfilling such plans.

""Why?"" Moshein said in a letter to the editor in the Oct. 14, 2012, Austin American-Statesman. ""Because the University of Texas has a $7 billion endowment, and the football program brought in $50 (million) in profit last year alone.""

""UT can well afford this medical school,"" his letter says. ""...Find the funding elsewhere. If it’s really that important, I suspect they will. They have the cash.""

To date, the UT System Board of Regents has committed at least $25 million a year toward the envisioned medical school, plus $5 million annually for eight years to buy equipment. This commitment is contingent on $35 million in annual community funding, which would come from the tax hike proposed by Travis County’s Central Health, along with continued financial support from the Seton Healthcare Family.

So, UT does stand to pony up.

Still, we wondered if  UT could pay for the sought school thanks to its $7 billion endowment and football team profits of $50 million, as Moshein's letter puts it.

By email, Moshein told us his endowment figure came from a Wikipedia entry for UT-Austin.

We ran the figure past Randy Wallace, the UT System’s chief budget officer, who emailed that one could arrive at such an estimate for the Austin campus’s overall ""endowment"" by imputing how much revenue it receives thanks to its stake in the Permanent University Fund plus the value of many individual campus endowments built on individual donations.

The permanent fund, established in 1876, helps support eligible institutions of the UT and Texas A&M University systems. Its value is rooted in 2.1 million acres of West Texas lands that produces two streams of income -- oil and gas royalties and surface interests such as grazing leases. Annual distributions from the total return on all investment assets is transferred to the Available University Fund, with two thirds going to the UT System and one third to the A&M system.

Moshein also noted a story posted on July 2, 2012, by Alcalde, the magazine of UT’s Ex-Students’ Association, which says that the annual distributions depend ""on the overall health of the global financial markets, because the return on investment depends on market performance.""

Wallace pointed out to us the annual distributions cannot exceed 7 percent of the average market value of the permanent fund investments. He said the fund was valued at $14.4 billion in the year that ended Aug. 31, 2011, and will be valued at more than that for the 2012 fiscal year once accounting is complete.

In 2011, Wallace said, some $506 million was distributed, with the UT System landing about $350 million. The Austin campus ultimately received nearly $158 million, he said, about 45 percent of what was available. That fits with a regents’ policy that 45 percent of the UT System’s money fielded from the available fund each year must  be spent supporting UT-Austin.

Wallace said the regents also are permitted to spend such money on system administration; debt service on certain bonds backed by the permanent fund; and initiatives that benefit the system as a whole.

For the year that ran through August 2010, the regents forwarded nearly $246 million in fund proceeds to the Austin campus, counting $20 million designated to support faculty recruitment and $5 million for the Center for Technology Commercialization. Wallace said the added dollops were to be spent over several years.

The regents budgeted $178.5 million in fund proceeds for the Austin campus for the year that ran through August 2012, according to a December 2011 UT System report to the governor and lawmakers. The report projects the Austin campus to field $166 million in this way in 2013 and $182 million in 2014.

So, it looks like the Austin campus can lately count on annual infusions of $158 million or more, thanks to the permanent fund.

Next, we turned to Moshein’s claim that the football team reaped $50 million in profits last year, which he attributed to 2009-10 totals described on the BusinessofCollegeSports.com sports business news website.

Most recently, UT football has netted some 56 percent more than that. To our inquiry, Nick Voinis, a UT athletics department spokesman, passed along the university’s latest summary of program revenues and expenses as submitted to the U.S. Department of Education. It says that in 2011-12, football program revenues were $103.8 million while expenses were $25.9 million, leaving a football profit of nearly $78 million.

And was the $78 million equivalent to loose cash? Negative, UT officials said.

By phone, Voinis told us the bulk of football’s profit helped cover the athletic department’s administrative costs and supported other sports programs.

On a UT web page, the athletic department says athletic-related income covers its salaries, fringe benefits, utilities and construction plus an administrative fee paid to the university for accounting and payroll costs, among others. The department also  pays approximately $15 million a year for other goods and services such as utilities, student-athlete housing, student-athlete tuition, event parking and transportation, the web entry says. Finally, from 2005-06 to 2010-11, the department says, it transferred $14.4 million to various academic programs.

A senior associate athletic director, Dave Marmion, said by phone that of the university’s 19 other men’s and women’s intercollegiate sports in 2011-12, 17 drew on football’s gains to cover expenses.

During the year, the baseball and men’s basketball teams had more revenue than expenses, UT’s submission to the education department indicates. UT’s unprofitable sports teams ran a little more than $17 million in the red, the report indicates. But this tally does not count $67 million in expenses marked as not attributable to a particular sport or sports.

Broadly, Voinis said, ""football drives our budget. It pays for a lot of things around here.""

We asked how UT would fund the unprofitable sports if the football proceeds were applied, say, to launch a medical school. Voinis suggested we ask higher-ups and campus spokesman Gary Susswein put us in touch with Kevin Hegarty, the institution’s chief financial officer, who said that if football profits were redirected to a medical school, programs that currently benefit from the profits would be out of luck.

Hegarty agreed the university enjoys around $400 million in combined annual proceeds from the available fund and many endowments established to support specific scholarships, professorships or other projects. But almost all the project-specific endowment funds could not be redirected to a medical school, he said, while shifting revenue tied to the permanent fund would short existing commitments to basic operating costs such as faculty and staff salaries and utilities.

""It’s committed,"" Hegarty said. ""I can’t just take it without saying, ‘Don’t teach whatever you’re teaching.’ ...I don’t have any endowments there to fund a medical school.""

We also asked Wallace of the UT System if UT-Austin could apply its permanent fund-related receipts to a project like a medical school. Legally yes, but practically no, he replied. ""The consequences of doing it would decimate the institution,"" he said.

Moshein, asked for further thoughts, did not quibble with UT having existing priorities. He said by email he still intends to vote against the tax increase.

Our ruling

Moshein said the University of Texas has a $7 billion endowment and its football program had a $50 million profit last year, indications it can afford to fund a medical school.

His endowment tally seems about right and he undershoots football’s 2011-12 profits. However, such funds couldn't be siphoned off for a medical school--year after year at that--without socking existing commitments.

Ohio Republican Party says Obama cut Medicare by $700 billion
","
Claims about the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, were staples of congressional campaigns in 2010. Many have resurfaced, or simply continued, in the 2012 federal elections.

Several appear in a brochure sent to voters by the Ohio Republican Party in support of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign.

Aimed specifically at seniors, the brochure says they can count on Romney, but not on President Obama, ""the first president in history to cut Medicare by $700 billion.""

If the claim has a familiar ring to it, it’s because it similar to others that PolitiFact has reviewed. But its continued use, including in the presidential and vice-presidential debates, makes it worth another look.

The ""cut"" refers to an aspect of the Affordable Care Act, the health care reform known as Obamacare.

There are cuts and then there are CUTS. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally ""cut"" a dollar from the budget of Medicare, which operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65.

Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years. Time’s passage has only boosted that number.

What kind of spending reductions?

They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.

Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.

Still, the overall Medicare budget is projected to continue to increase. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law. But it doesn’t reduce its overall budget.

That’s why claims that Obama would ""cut"" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. And in the past, PolitiFact has rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context.

Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law’s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion.

The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency with expert staff that generates projections about how laws affect the federal budget and economy, determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion.

That CBO estimate is cited as the supporting source for the claim in the brochure, that Obama is ""the first president in history to cut Medicare by $700 billion.""

That claim is partially accurate.

That amount refers to the savings expected from Obamacare’s reductions in growth of Medicare spending over 10 years, primarily paid to insurers and hospitals. Those savings were credited to the health care law to keep it from adding to the deficit.

What the law does not do, as the claim implies, is chop $700 billion that was already allocated to Medicare for its programs..

One other point worth noting: The changes that lead to the projected savings are a result of legislation that was approved by both houses of Congress and signed into law by Obama -- not as a result of an executive order or decision Obama made individually in his administration.

Those are important details that give context to the statement.

Gerald Daugherty says he is the reason MoPac drivers don’t pay a toll when crossing over William Cannon
","
For many South Austinites in 2004, a proposal to charge a toll on MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) at William Cannon Drive was a bridge too far.

Gerald Daugherty, then commissioner for Travis County’s Precinct 3, heard from quite a lot of those folks. And in his bid to retake that job Nov. 6, 2012, he has said he served them well: Daugherty ""is the reason we do not pay a toll every time we pass over the bridge at MoPac and William Cannon,"" according to a campaign flier.

That bridge was at the center of debate over the region’s 2004 toll road plan -- a debate so heated it launched an effort to recall two Austin City Council members and the mayor.

Road wrangling in Precinct 3 hasn’t calmed down much since then; the fight over Texas 45 Southwest underpinned a fact-check we recently wrote about Daugherty’s Democratic opponent, incumbent Karen Huber.

In fact, Daugherty bumper stickers in his 2012 race read, ""Want SH 45 SW built? Vote for Gerald Daugherty.""

So we wondered: Was he the reason the toll at William Cannon didn’t happen?

It’s a ""bold"" claim, Daugherty said when we called him. ""We probably shouldn’t have used that definitive a position versus saying, ‘I was one of the people that led the charge against’ "" the toll, he said.

Campaign manager Kathy Pillmore told us by email that the flier was mailed out May 10, 2012, in advance of the May 29 primary vote. Daugherty bested two fellow Republicans in the primary and now faces Huber, who defeated him for the seat in 2008, and Libertarian nominee Pat Dixon.

Pillmore said the campaign stands by the statement. Daugherty’s website features a slightly different version: ""William Cannon Toll Bridge - working with State Representative Terry Keel we were instrumental in stopping TxDOT from tolling the overpass at Loop 1 South and William Cannon Road.""

The Texas Department of Transportation was in a fix at the time, Daugherty said, lacking sufficient money to build new roads while maintaining existing roads. Tollways were one option.

A Dec. 27, 2004, Austin American-Statesman transportation column recapped the opening salvos of ""The Great Turnpike War of 2004"":
  
(I)n April, the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority and Bob Daigh, the Austin district engineer for the Texas Department of Transportation, unveiled a toll road plan of eye-popping scope: ... a $1.8 billion, seven-road plan. 
… The reaction locally was subdued at first, and even a well-attended public hearing in May was relatively low-key. 
But then state Rep. Terry Keel of Austin and Travis County Commissioner Gerald Daugherty, Republicans with a history of supporting roads, unexpectedly came out against parts of the plan, especially levying tolls on a short stretch of MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) at William Cannon Drive. 
""Double taxation,"" they called it, because the project, already under construction, was being built with (state) gasoline tax dollars. 
… (Circle C neighborhood resident Sal) Costello began a recall petition campaign against Austin Mayor Will Wynn and two other council members who voted for the plan … (B)ehind the scenes, talks continued about how to change the plan and quell the uproar. 
  
A Sept. 20, 2004, Statesman news story referring to the uproar said, ""The spark that lighted that still out-of-control blaze was the state's plan to charge people a half-buck to stay on MoPac and avoid the light at William Cannon Drive.""

Daugherty said, according to a Statesman news story from May 4, 2004, and transportation column from May 31, 2004, that he got 600 phone calls in three days objecting to the toll plan and more than 200 messages in the first week and a half after it was announced.

What got Austin drivers hopping mad was the fact that a toll was going to be charged on a road that had already been paid for.

Drawing on state gas tax revenues, work had started on the 1.45-mile overpass earlier in 2004. Until MoPac traffic could sail above William Cannon, drivers were funneled through the stoplights there.

Daugherty recalled: ""They were just about ready to lay the columns across those pillars that had been there forever, and we all knew that, ‘Wow, we’re just about to get this road, this bridge put across. And man, won’t that be great, because everyone’s not going to have to get off.’""

The plan unveiled April 24, 2004, included a toll there precisely because the overpass was incomplete.

Daigh, the TxDOT engineer who drafted the plan with the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority, told us in a recent telephone interview that few Austin roads were eligible for tolls because tolls could not be charged on an existing road or a road that had no alternative route. The 2004 plan, he said, included every option in the area.

When the plan was announced, Daugherty recalled, ""You talk about people coming unhinged."" He said he heard opposition from both residents and businesspeople in his precinct, which covers southwestern Travis County and contains the overpass site.

A Nov. 28, 2004, Statesman transportation column said Keel and Daugherty had held a press conference in May of that year condemning the toll road plan. The column said residents’ opposition and elected officials’ work got the William Cannon toll dropped.

Daugherty told us, ""I think I probably was the lead person on it. But Terry and I did the press conference together and said, ‘OK, well, hey, we’re just not going to be supportive of this.’ "" He said he believes his opposition was influential in part because ""I was so well-known for being supportive of roadways.""

But yes, he said, it was not a one-man show: ""I guess if someone wants to say technically, you weren’t the only guy... Anybody that knew anything about it knew that I was the energy behind fighting this like the dickens.""

The toll plan was added to the region’s long-range transportation plan by a July 12, 2004, vote of the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization board.

At that meeting, we learned via email from CAMPO assistant director Bubba Needham, Daugherty moved to delete the toll from the MoPac overpass after he and other members of the board (which is composed mostly of local elected officials) spoke against the plan. His motion failed 17-6, according to the minutes. Voting with him to delete the toll were Keel and fellow Republican state Reps. Todd Baxter and Jack Stick; Democratic state Rep. Elliott Naishtat; and Austin City Council Member Daryl Slusher.

Afterward, according to the minutes, the board voted 16-7 to add the toll proposals to the long-range plan; the seven opposed were those who voted for Daugherty’s motion plus Democratic state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez.

Six months later, the board reversed course by adopting a resolution to remove the overpass from toll consideration. According to the minutes of the board’s Jan. 24, 2005, meeting, board chair Gonzalo Barrientos told the board that although that toll had been seen as an essential source of money to improve MoPac, he, Mayor Will Wynn and Precinct 2 commissioner Karen Sonleitner had gotten financial backing from the Texas Transportation Commission to go ahead with the MoPac work without those toll revenues.

Barrientos said, according to the minutes, that an engineering concern with the overpass had come up. Asked to explain that issue, Daigh said that the mobility authority had decided drivers would end up in a traffic jam.

According to the minutes, Barrientos moved to ""de-toll"" the overpass, citing the traffic jam concern and noting the toll revenue was no longer an issue. The motion passed.

We called Barrientos to get his take on who was most responsible for getting the overpass toll dropped. No single person makes such a decision happen, he told us, but Daugherty was key.

The commissioner’s consistent opposition to the overpass toll, ""speaking up every time the issue came up,"" surely helped, he said.

Barrientos characterized the discussion that he, Wynn and Sonleitner had with the Transportation Commission as the type of negotiations needed to reach any agreement and said ""there might have been others"" helping to reach the agreement.

""I think probably everybody"" gets credit, he said, ""but Daugherty was in the forefront.""

Daigh, who is now senior director of infrastructure for Williamson County, told us he believes there would be a toll on that road if not for Daugherty. ""He was the leader of the effort not to have MoPac tolled,"" Daigh said.

Our ruling

Daugherty told us he overstated in claiming that he ""is the reason we do not pay a toll every time we pass over the bridge at MoPac and William Cannon.""

He was an early and prominent opponent. But his claim leaves out the many residents and public officials who spoke, lobbied and voted against the overpass toll and worked to find an alternative. No one person was the reason there’s no toll at the bridge. We rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978AFE80>],/factchecks/2012/oct/19/gerald-daugherty/gerald-daugherty-says-he-reason-mopac-drivers-dont/
"['Oregon', 'Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'Voting Record', 'Oregon Senate Republicans (The Leadership Fund) ']","
Did Laurie Monnes Anderson vote to let violent criminals out of jail early?
","
Some legislative bills are so controversial that two, three years later they still serve as meaty fodder for political campaigns. House Bill 3508 from 2009 is just that bill and it’s playing a role in the race between state Sen. Laurie Monnes Anderson, D-Gresham, and her Republican opponent, Gresham dentist Scott Hansen.

The Leadership Fund, known as Senate Republicans, recently sent a mailer to voters in east Multnomah County, describing Monnes Anderson as friendly to violent criminals.

""Would you have voted to let violent criminals out of jail early? Senator Laurie Monnes Anderson did …"" reads one side of the mailer, which features corrections bars. The flip side explains in some detail how she voted to give ""criminals, some of them violent, a chance to get out of jail before they served their full sentences.""

Did Monnes Anderson -- and other Democrats -- vote for legislation that let ""violent criminals"" out of prison early? Before they finished their prison time? And is giving ""violent criminals"" a chance to get out of prison earlier the same as voting to let them out earlier? PolitiFact Oregon set off sleuthing.

To do that, we need to explain House Bill 3508. The legislation temporarily suspended most provisions of Measure 57, a drug and property offense sentencing measure approved by voters in 2008. The bill was expected to save the state $50 million over the two-year budget period at a time when lawmakers were trying to save the public safety budget from more reductions.

We should note that House Bill 3508 cleared the Legislature with a few Republican votes -- but most Republicans strenuously opposed it, along with district attorneys and other victims’ advocates. Democrats and their allies, on the other side, called the changes a smarter, more efficient way to address crime.

The part that matters for this fact check is that the legislation ""also increased earned, good-time credit for some nonviolent offenders, saving about $6.5 million,"" according to a news report from The Oregonian at the time. In other words, inmates eligible for a 20 percent reduction in prison time could be eligible for a 30 percent reduction should a judge agree, saving bed space and incarceration costs.

We reported that only nonviolent offenders would be eligible because that’s how it was billed. (See press statement from Rep. Chip Shields, D-Portland.) But a few months later, The Oregonian published another news report showing that criminals with violent backgrounds had been granted early releaseas allowed by the law. From the news report:

""They include Troy Lee Hischar, who fired a bullet so close to his ex-girlfriend's skull that it clipped off a tuft of hair; Raul Peña-Jimenez, who gave a 16-year-old girl drugs and alcohol before sexually assaulting her; and Joseph Duane Betts, a convicted child molester who exposed himself to two boys.""

Awful, right? But here’s something worth emphasizing: House Bill 3508 didn’t create a new category of inmates eligible to get ""out of jail early."" These inmates were eligible for a 20 percent reduction on some aspect of their sentence anyway, regardless of the violent or abusive nature of the crimes on their record.

Peña-Jimenez, for example, ""plied a 16-year-old Aloha girl with alcohol and marijuana and sexually assaulted her several times, court records show. He later pleaded guilty to giving drugs to a minor and second-degree sex abuse in exchange for a 2-year, 7-month prison term."" Despite objections by prosecutors, according to The Oregonian, Peña-Jimenez, who was already approved for early release, was approved for extra time off -- 18 days -- under the new law.

Democrats admit they made a mistake in that they listed some offenses that would be ineligible for the extra 10 percent time off, but not others. When lawmakers convened in February 2010, they approved Senate Bill 1007, which made more offenders ineligible for a further 10 percent reduction.

Monnes Anderson and Senate Democrats referred us to state Sen. Floyd Prozanski, D-Eugene, chairman of Senate Judiciary. He called the oversight inadvertent and emphasized that the bill set up the possibility of early release, but did not guarantee it. He said that they fixed the problem.

Not surprisingly, Republicans find his remarks irrelevant.

""Legislators are responsible for the outcomes of the bills they vote on, whether something is inadvertent or not,"" said Michael Gay, spokesman for The Leadership Fund. ""Criminals were released early because of a bill passed by the Legislature. If my family had been hurt directly because of that bill, I'd want to hold someone accountable, whether it was inadvertent or not.""

The Oregon Anti-Crime Alliance opposed the legislation. Doug Harcleroad, a senior policy adviser with the group, said it’s OK to target Monnes Anderson with the language we’re checking. ""They should take responsibility for their votes,"" he said. ""You don’t get to walk away from your vote like that, and it’s fair to say in the political realm that this is what they voted for.""

But Shannon Wight, associate director of the Partnership for Safety and Justice, an advocacy group that stresses prevention, takes the opposite view. ""They didn’t vote for the early release of prisoners,"" she said. The legislation ""allowed for the possibility of some prisoners to become eligible -- only eligible -- for an earned time increase … but this was not automatic.""

Obviously, legislators voted for the bill hoping some offenders would get out early and save the state money. To date, more than 5,300 inmates have earned a 30 percent reduction in their sentence time and been released, including people sentenced for the first time after the law went into effect. Nearly 900 inmates were denied extra time off. The average number of days ""saved"" is around 50.  

PolitiFact Oregon generally finds that scare tactics -- for example, accusing a candidate of voting to ""cut"" Medicare -- are misleading. But we’re also guided in our ruling by the principle that legislators are responsible for the votes they take, unintended consequences and all. Monnes Anderson and other Democrats voted for legislation that offered early release to inmates, some of whom had committed ""violent"" crimes against another person.

Senate Republicans’ statement about Monnes Anderson is accurate, but it needs additional information and clarification. In this case, the legislators realized the error and fixed it. The law also applied to inmates already eligible to get out early.

We rule the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3C6AC0>],/factchecks/2012/oct/19/oregon-senate-republicans/did-laurie-monnes-anderson-vote-let-violent-crimin/

No ‘jobs tax’ in Pritzker’s tax plan, despite what attack ad claims
","Two months after taking office, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker took the first step toward making good on a major campaign promise by outlining a plan to replace Illinois’ flat-rate income tax with a system that would tax higher levels of income at higher rates. Pritzker wants lawmakers to put a measure on the 2020 ballot asking voters to approve a constitutional amendment giving them authority to replace Illinois’ flat-rate income tax, currently set at 4.95 percent for all taxpayers regardless of their wealth, with a series of graduated rates. He says the rate structure he’s proposing would generate billions in new revenue by raising taxes on the state’s wealthiest 3 percent, while providing modest cuts to — or holding the line for — those who make less. But a business-linked group run by former Illinois Manufacturers’ Association President Greg Baise is out with an ad warning middle-class Illinoisans to watch their wallets. ""Pritzker and [Democratic House Speaker Michael] Madigan want to change the constitution to allow a permanent jobs tax on middle class families,"" a narrator says before going on to argue Springfield politicians can’t be trusted after hiking taxes in previous years. ""They’re putting a constitutional amendment on your 2020 ballot, paving the way for their jobs tax on the middle class."" Baise’s new group, Ideas Illinois, is clearly referring to Pritzker’s plan for a graduated income tax. But just about everything else about the ad couldn’t be fuzzier, so we decided to take a closer look. While there’s no official definition for a ""jobs tax,"" it’s pretty clear Pritzker’s plan doesn’t contain one. Experts we spoke with noted the term is sometimes used colloquially to describe so-called head taxes like the $4-per-worker monthly charge Chicago once levied on larger employers. But that in no way resembles what Pritzker is proposing. Richard Auxier, a research associate with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said it is ""completely incorrect"" to use the term ""jobs tax"" to refer to a graduated income tax proposal. ""The income tax is not on people, it is on your income,"" he said. Auxier also dismissed the ad’s contention that amending the constitution to allow for graduated rates would make permanent whatever rates Pritzker and state lawmakers eventually decide to enact. ""There is no such thing as a permanent tax increase,"" he said. ""All you’ve got to do is come back and change the law."" Indeed, the ad itself underscores that fact when it references past tax hikes. Since its inception in 1969, Illinois’ individual income tax rate has changed eight times, rising and falling and rising again before hitting 3 percent in 1990, then ping ponging up to 5 percent in 2011, down to 3.75 percent in 2015 and back up to 4.95 percent in 2017. There are two parts to Pritzker’s tax plan, and neither of them would appear to raise taxes on the middle class. Step one involves that constitutional amendment, which, if approved, would then allow Pritzker to ask lawmakers to set a new schedule of graduated tax rates that charge more to the wealthy. Pritzker has floated a plan for that new rate menu, which he says would cut taxes for the vast majority of Illinois taxpayers. Only those with incomes over $250,000-a-year would pay more, the governor says. It’s entirely possible Pritzker's plan for rates could change if the amendment passes. It’s also possible lawmakers could approve it as is and then raise rates somewhere down the line. That’s what the ad hints at. But it’s important to note that lawmakers can hike the flat income tax rate now, a power Ideas Illinois even stresses. That renders nonsensical the ominous warnings sounded by the ad. We reached out to Baise for clarification through several email and phone contacts, but he did not respond. Also unanswered were questions we posed to Ideas Illinois, a project of a non-profit advocacy group called the Illinois Coalition of Jobs, Growth and Prosperity long linked to Republican powerbroker Ron Gidwitz, President Donald Trump’s ambassador to Belgium. So we asked tax experts to take a stab at deciphering the group’s underlying message. ""I think what they’re trying to say is that this increased income tax will decrease the number of jobs in the state,"" said Carol Portman, president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers’ Federation of Illinois. Indeed, Baise made that case in a commentary piece in The Chicago Tribune published before Pritzker unveiled the specifics of his tax plan, arguing that raising taxes on income above a certain level ""will accelerate the push of already-struggling job creators out of Illinois."" But Portman said studies on the effects of different tax rates on job growth at the state level are incredibly mixed. ""You can find numbers that are real and true to support just about any argument you want to make,"" she explained. ""It’s so hard to isolate."" A 2015 Tax Policy Center report wryly noted that recent studies have variously found that tax cuts ""raise, reduce, do not affect, or have no clear effect on growth."" The results of the center’s own research indicated that neither the amount of revenue a state levies under a tax nor how high it set its top marginal rates ""bore any stable relation"" to economic growth across states and over time. What’s more, the potential impact on job creators is not an argument the ad itself bothered to tease out. Chris Mooney, a state politics expert at the University of Illinois’ Institute of Government & Public Affairs, said that’s likely because asking working- and middle-class voters to spare the wealthy from higher taxes is a tough sell. Instead of getting into details, he explained, it can be more effective politically to rely on ""classic fear-mongering"" techniques. ""It spooks people and it allows them to think the worst,"" Mooney said. ""When you’re not specific and you give them vague frames of negativity, they can rush to their own negative place."" An ad from the anti-tax organization Ideas Illinois claims Pritzker’s tax plan calls for changing the constitution ""to allow a permanent jobs tax on middle class families."" But Pritzker is proposing an income tax, which is exactly what its name implies: a tax on income, not on jobs. As for permanence, any initial rates set under a graduated tax can be revised up or down, just like the current flat rate has been changed in both directions over the last decade. The only difference is that a rate hike under the flat tax hits all taxpayers, while under a graduated tax it could be engineered to impact only the wealthy. We rate this claim False. FALSE — The statement is not accurate.

About 1 in 4 Texas women of reproductive age don't have health insurance
","Texas lawmakers debated the finer points of their biennial budget proposal well into the night on Wednesday, proposing amendments, amendments to those amendments and ultimately passing the massive $251 billion bill. One amendment (which was shot down in a party-line vote, with Republicans in opposition) would have required the state to accept federal Medicaid expansion dollars to cover low-income Texans. Texas is one of 14 states that has not opted to expand Medicaid. State Rep. John Bucy III introduced the amendment and said Texans are losing out on quality health care by not expanding the insurance program. ""Right now, 1 in 4 Texas women of reproductive age are uninsured, totaling 1.5 million Texas women,"" said Bucy, a Democrat who represents a portion of Williamson County. ""While many of these women qualify for health care coverage during pregnancy, they lose that care shortly thereafter. It is critical that we increase access to health care for women before, after and between pregnancies by expanding Medicaid."" Bucy shared the same claim about uninsured women in a post on Twitter during the debate. So we had to ask, are there really that many Texas women without health insurance? State agencies don’t track this number Allison Heinrich, Bucy’s legislative director, said the statistic came from a letter an advocacy group sent to the Texas Senate’s Health and Human Services Committee in September. The letter states that 1 in 4 Texas women between the ages of 15 and 44 are uninsured. The letter — sent by a coalition of organizations advocating for better health care called Cover Texas Now — attributed the statistic to a series of reports from the Texas Department of State Health Services. Laura Guerra-Cardus of the Cover Texas Now coalition and the Children’s Defense Fund said the citation in the letter was incorrect and that the group actually got this information from a 2016 report published by the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities. The report states that about 27 percent of women of childbearing age in Texas are uninsured. Officials with the Texas Department of State Health Services, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission and the Texas Department of Insurance said their respective agencies do not track the uninsured population in Texas. Census data backs up the claim The report cited the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey and person-level data sets used by researchers. This information lets users examine a sample of individual responses to the survey and extrapolate about things like the number of uninsured women in a particular age bracket. Oliver Bernstein, spokesman for the Center for Public Policy Priorities, said researchers at the center plugged the data into statistical software to come to the conclusion that 1 in 4 women between the ages of 15 and 44 are uninsured in Texas, as of their 2016 report. The 2018 edition of the report came to the same conclusion. This type of data analysis is common. The Urban Institute conducted a similar study of the uninsured population in Texas in December and they used this person-level data to identify the percentage of different population groups in Texas that are uninsured. They didn’t look specifically at uninsured women of reproductive age, but found that about 18 percent of all women in Texas are uninsured. The Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that is pro-abortion rights, published a study in December that looked at the uninsured rate of women of reproducitve age using the same data. The group's analysis found that, of the 5.9 million Texas women between 15 and 44, about 1.4 million (or 24 percent) are uninsured. This means about 1 in 4 women in this age bracket are without health insurance. Published data from the Census Bureau (which has already been crunched) also supports Bucy’s claim, although it doesn't consider the entire age bracket in question . Age groupings for total population count and for uninsured women don’t line up, so the most accurate group to analyze here would be women between 19 and 44, which doesn’t include all women of reproductive age. There are about 5.2 million Texas women between the ages of 19 and 44, the data shows. Of those women, more than 1.2 million do not have health insurance. This means that about 1 in 4 Texas women between the ages of 19 and 44 do not have health insurance. Our ruling Bucy said, ""one in four Texas women of reproductive age are uninsured, totaling 1.5 million Texas women."" His source was a report from an Austin-based group that conducted an analysis of Census numbers. The research method is one that has been used by other organizations and a study from the Guttmacher Institute had similar findings. An analysis of publicly available Census numbers offers an estimate that also supports Bucy’s claim. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.  Correction:  This fact-check has been updated to address a mischaracterization​ of the number of women who are uninsured. About 1 in 4 women between 15 and 44 do not have health insurance. The rating is unchanged.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FA2940>],/factchecks/2019/mar/29/john-bucy-iii/about-1-4-texas-women-reproductive-age-dont-have-h/

Did Vermont’s House just pass a carbon tax?
","Before this year’s legislative session even started, activists were protesting against a carbon tax. But despite wielding a bolstered majority in both the House and Senate, Democratic leaders in the Legislature said carbon pricing was not on their agenda in 2019. When Progressives finally introduced carbon tax bills in February, Speaker of the House Mitzi Johnson, D-South Hero, said it was too late. Then the House Ways and Means Committee decided last week to increase the tax on home heating fuels to raise money for low-income Vermonters to weatherize their homes, making the buildings healthier and less costly to live in, as well as more environmentally friendly. And so began a debate in Vermont’s Statehouse over whether the home weatherization bill, H.439, is a carbon tax by another name. Rep. Christopher Mattos, R-Milton, proposed an amendment changing language in the bill to call it a ""fuel carbon tax"" to make it explicit. During debate on the House floor, Rep. Scott Beck, R-St. Johnsbury, spoke in support of the Mattos amendment. ""Madam Speaker: Vermonters deserve transparency,"" he said. ""The fuel tax is a tax on carbon heating fuels, with the revenue used to reduce carbon usage. It is a carbon tax whether it is convenient to say it or not."" Rep. George Till, D-Jericho, said Beck was mistaken. ""This is not a carbon tax. A carbon tax is based on the amount of carbon released when a fuel is burned. Here we have tax based on gallons purchased,"" he said. ""The purpose of a carbon tax is to alter behavior,"" he added. ""The purpose of this bill is to alter buildings to reduce money spent on heating and cooling and to improve people’s health."" So is the fuel levy a carbon tax or not? We decided to try to cut through the noise and come up with an answer. A carbon tax is most often defined as a tax on the burning of carbon, calculated based on the weight of carbon being emitted. The tax is explicitly designed to be an economic lever to reduce carbon emissions. The Oxford Dictionary of Environment and Conservation defines a carbon tax as: ""A tax or surcharge on the sale of fossil fuels (oil, coal, and gas) that varies according to the carbon content of each fuel, and is designed to discourage the use of fossil fuels and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide."" The weatherization bill in Vermont’s Statehouse increases the tax on propane, kerosene and home heating oil from 2 cents to 4 cents per gallon. While it is applied only to fossil fuels containing carbon, the tax rate is not based on the carbon content. If it were, the tax rate for each of the fuels would be different. Propane emits 139.05 pounds of CO2 per million British thermal units (Btu), a commonly used calculation. Kerosene emits 159.40 pounds of CO2 per million Btu, and heating oil emits 161.30 lb CO2/million Btu. Beck’s logic was that 1) the fuel tax applies to carbon heating fuels and 2) the revenue is used to reduce carbon usage, and therefore 3) it’s a carbon tax. The first two points are true, but the tax is still on the fuel, not on the carbon. It’s certainly worth noting that the tax only applies to carbon-based heating methods, as opposed to wood heat or electricity, which could come from wind, hydro or solar power. In that way, the bill could act as a slight deterrent against use of traditional carbon-emitting fuels. Till and other supporters note, however, that the bill is not designed to discourage the use of fossil fuels and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The two explicit carbon tax bills introduced this year both charge $5 per ton of carbon content in fiscal year 2021, and then scale up the tax incrementally -- one to $40 by fiscal 2028 and the other to $50 by fiscal 2030. That works out to about 14 to 17 cents per gallon when the tax reaches its peak. However, a study commissioned by Vermont and conducted by Resources for the Future found that even at those levels, carbon pricing won’t cause major changes to consumer behavior. ""Transportation and heating fuel uses are relatively insensitive (or inelastic) to moderate changes in fuel prices; emissions in these sectors are not projected to fall substantially in response to the carbon pricing levels considered here,"" it said. The weatherization bill, taken as a whole, is also similar to a carbon tax schemes in that it is designed to reduce carbon emissions by putting the tax revenue toward home projects that reduce the amount of energy needed to keep residents warm. (The Resources for the Future report notes that a carbon tax will only be effective in reducing emissions if the revenue is put back into carbon reducing initiatives.) It’s also worth noting that there are other, less common, definitions of a carbon tax. The Carbon Tax Center, which advocates for carbon pricing, says ""A carbon tax is a fee imposed on the burning of carbon-based fuels (coal, oil, gas)."" The Cambridge Dictionary defines it as ""a tax on the use of fuels that produce gases that harm the atmosphere."" It’s easier to fit the proposed heating fuel tax into those definitions, but it’s still a stretch. Rep. Scott Beck, R-Johnsbury, said: ""It is a carbon tax whether it is convenient to say it or not."" The heating fuel tax achieves some of the same objectives of a carbon tax, such as raising the cost of fossil fuel to reduce carbon emissions. But the tax is not high enough to act as a significant deterrent. While the bill may look like a carbon tax, it is not literally a tax on carbon, most clearly illustrated by the fact that fuels with different carbon emission levels are taxed at the same rate. And therefore it is not a carbon tax. We rate Beck’s claim mostly false.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097561A00>],/factchecks/2019/mar/29/scott-beck/did-vermonts-house-just-pass-carbon-tax/

Gillibrand claims most votes against Trump Cabinet nominees
","Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is trying to draw distinctions between herself and her many opponents for the Democratic nomination for president. She told a crowd in Michigan that she has the best record of voting against President Donald Trump’s Cabinet nominees. ""I voted against Betsy DeVos,"" Gillibrand said, referring to the secretary of education. ""I voted against most of President Trump’s nominees for his Cabinet, because they were either unqualified or they did not have the experience necessary. I have the best voting record against Trump nominees of anyone else running for president."" Trump has put forth thousands of nominees for Senate confirmation, from seats on the U.S. Supreme Court to appointments to various government boards. From the context of Gillibrand’s statements, we decided to investigate the New York senator’s record on votes for Cabinet-level positions. Trump’s cabinet includes the 15 heads of executive departments, such as the secretary of health and human services and the secretary of defense, and other appointments, such as the U.S. trade representative, director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the director of national intelligence. Most require Senate confirmation. We looked at the roll call votes for each of these, and took note of votes cast by the six senators running for the Democratic nomination for president: Gillibrand, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.   There have been 29 votes for Cabinet-level positions in the Trump administration, including 19 current appointees and 10 people who were appointed and have left their posts. Some of these positions have been filled more than once because of resignations, as in the case of the attorney general, where William Barr succeeded Jeff Sessions. A president has discretion on whether certain positions will be part of the Cabinet. For example, the post of United Nations ambassador was a Cabinet-level position when Nikki Haley was appointed to it in 2017. Since Haley’s resignation was announced in 2018, a Trump official said the position will no longer be a Cabinet-level post. For senators seeking to be president, opposition to Trump was a strong theme in their voting records. All six voted against many of Trump’s nominees, including Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and both secretaries of Health and Human Services, Tom Price and Alex Azar.   On other nominees, the group was split. Elaine Chao’s nomination as transportation secretary drew a 93-6 vote in the Senate, with yes votes from Harris and Klobuchar but no votes from Gillibrand, Booker, Sanders and Warren.   Gillibrand voted only twice in favor of Trump’s Cabinet appointees, for Haley as U.N. ambassador and for David Shulkin for Department of Veterans Affairs. She voted 27 times against Trump Cabinet nominees. Warren and Sanders each had 26 votes against these Cabinet nominees, and three votes in favor of them. Booker and Harris had 25 votes against, and four votes in favor. Klobuchar voted to confirm 12 of Trump’s nominees, tops among the senators seeking to be president, while she voted against 17 other Cabinet nominees. We also looked at roll call votes for Trump’s many other nominees to get a sense of the rest of Gillibrand’s record, though this tally did not affect our ruling. With very few exceptions, Gillibrand voted against these nominees as well, people such as Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (she was one of six to vote no, along with Booker, Harris and Warren) and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whose appointment passed 50-48. She voted yes on R.D. James to be assistant secretary of the Army, which drew a 89-1 vote, with Sanders opposed. She also voted yes on two judicial appointments, Claria Horn Boom, opposed only by Sanders, and Ralph Erickson, opposed only by Warren. Many appointments were approved by the Senate by voice vote.    In its analysis of voting records on all matters (not limited to Trump’s appointments), the website FiveThirtyEight found that among senators, Gillibrand has the record least in line with Trump’s positions. Gillibrand has sought to distinguish herself from the field of Democratic candidates for president by stating her voting record against Trump’s Cabinet nominees is stronger. She has voted against 27 of his nominees, while Warren and Sanders have opposed 26. Booker and Harris voted against Trump Cabinet nominees 25 times, and Klobuchar voted against them 17 times. We rate Gillibrand’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AE03C0>],/factchecks/2019/mar/29/kirsten-gillibrand/gillibrand-claims-most-votes-against-trump-cabinet/

No, famed professor of Islam didn’t say Muslims will turn to ‘violent Jihad’ to colonize US, Canada
","Tariq Ramadan, a professor of Islamic studies at Oxford University, is known to be controversial. He is the grandson of Hassan Al-Banna, founder of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood, and is currently on conditional release after being jailed for 10 months on charges of sexual assault. The Swiss-born scholar has also made waves over his views on Islam. Recently, an online quote attributed to the academic claims he said the goal of Muslims is to invoke Sharia law in the U.S. and Canada. The Facebook post from March 20 displays a picture of Ramadan with his name and title and attributes the following quote to the professor: ""We are not here to adopt Western values, we are here to colonize the US and Canada, and spread Islamic Sharia law. Canada has one of the easiest legal systems to penetrate and advance Sharia from within – but if that doesn’t work, we won’t hesitate to use violent Jihad."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While Ramadan may be controversial, we were not able to pinpoint a single statement in his speeches, writings or interviews that is anything close to this quote. The statement seems to have originated, in part, by Marc Lebuis, founder of the Canadian-French website Point de Bascule. The site says it aims to ""explore and expose Islamist activities in our midst."" In commentary on a 2015 YouTube video, Lebuis first discussed a statement Ramadan made in a 2004 interview with Egypt Today magazine. In the video, Lebuis claims that Ramadan said in that interview that he ""specifically targeted Muslims not to use Sharia law, the term Sharia, but rather targeted Canada as being one of the easiest legal systems to penetrate in order to advance Sharia principles."" But in the 2004 story, Ramadan actually says: ""Within the normative law in Canada, they have huge latitude for Muslims to propose an Islamic contract. These courts are not necessary; all they do is stress the fact that Muslims have specific laws and for the time being this is not how we want to be perceived. We need to show that our way of thinking is universal, that we can live with the law and there is no contradiction. It’s more useful for Muslims to examine the legal framework they have in Canada, which is one of the most open in the world and come up with something Islamic that at the same time fits the Canadian reality."" Lebuis later claims in the video: ""Recently Tariq Ramadan, about two years ago in a conference, says ‘We are not here to adopt American values,’ because he was in the United States when he said that, ‘but we are rather here to colonize the United States with our values, with our understanding of Islam.’"" It appears from the sources listed on Lebuis’ website that Lebuis was most likely referring to comments Ramadan made during an Islamic Circle of North America fundraiser in Dallas on July 27, 2011. While Ramadane did mention colonizing, his message differs from Lebuis’ account. Toward the beginning of the speech, Ramadan says: ""It should be us, with our understanding of Islam, our principles, colonizing positively the United States of America by making it a centrality of our love, our family, our kids, our children, the essence of our religion."" Perhaps the most problematic portion of this Facebook post, however, is the last part of the quote attributed to Ramadan: ""we won’t hesitate to use violent Jihad."" This appears to be entirely fabricated as, rape charges aside, he has called out violence within religion. It is important to note that Ramadan has spoken positively about ""Jihad,"" but his views usually follow a mainstream understanding of the term: ""Jihad is the expression of a rejection of all injustice, as also the necessary assertion of balance and harmony in equity. One hopes for a nonviolent struggle, far removed from the horrors of armed conflict."" Pointe De Bascule’s breakdown of Ramadan’s 2011 speech was republished by several anti-Islam websites, and the quote shared on social media appears to have turned into a mashup and exaggeration of Lebuis’ paraphrasing of Ramadan’s words.

No, Donna Brazile is not a criminal
","Fox News recently announced that Donna Brazile, the former interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, is joining the network as a commentator, and some viewers were chagrined. ""So Fox removes the judge for speaking the truth about a traitor in Congress, then hires this DNC criminal, who was caught giving debate questions to Killery,"" reads the text over a photo of Donna Brazile that was posted to Facebook on March 18. ""Fox has betrayed the people."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s look at it. First, the judge reference. In March, Fox News suspended host Jeanine Pirro from her show ""Justice with Judge Jeanine"" after she read a scripted commentary about U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., that was ""widely criticized as Islamophobic,"" according to CNN. Fox revealed that same month that Brazile was joining the network. Brazile is a former interim chair of the DNC, and a former CNN commentator. CNN forced Brazile to resign in October 2016 after emails released by WikiLeaks revealed that she shared with Hillary Clinton’s aides some of the questions that CNN moderators would likely ask the then-presidential candidate during network-sponsored debates and town hall meetings. ""We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor,"" network spokeswoman Lauren Pratapas said at the time. ""CNN never gave Brazile access to any questions, prep material, attendee list, background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debate."" Brazile was a Clinton supporter and, The New York Times reported, the fact that she shared questions with a candidate ""would seem to undercut the impartiality of the event and, as a CNN contributor, potentially reflect poorly on the network."" In a March 2017 essay for Time magazine, Brazile called emailing the Clinton campaign ""a mistake I will forever regret."" Brazile did not immediately respond to PolitiFact’s email asking about the post’s accuracy. A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee also did not respond to an email from PolitiFact. But we found no evidence that Brazile faced criminal charges in connection with the leak, though some people wished otherwise. Searching for news coverage of any arrests or crimes in connection with Brazile, we found this Change.org petition called: ""Arrest donna brazile."" In November 2017, Politico published an excerpt from Brazile’s then-forthcoming book, ""Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House."" In it, she describes trying to find evidence of internal corruption that would show the DNC was rigging the system to throw the primary to Hillary. She discovered a ""victory fund agreement"" between the campaign and the DNC signed before Clinton secured the Democratic nomination. ""If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead,"" she wrote. ""This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the party’s integrity."" The conservative-leaning Weekly Standard did its own fact-check of a claim that the DNC illegally stole the 2016 primary from Bernie Sanders. In it, the publication pointed to a class-action lawsuit against the DNC that alleged the organization violated its own charter ""by working with a single campaign to effectively choose who would win the Democratic ballot."" The DNC responded that it had no legal obligations ""to remain impartial throughout the process."" The lawsuit was dismissed.

Will Trump's border wall cost less than Obamacare website?
","As President Donald Trump attempts to go around Congress for border wall funding, a recent Facebook post claimed that the border wall will be cheaper than healthcare.gov, the Obamacare marketplace where Americans can compare and purchase health plans. ""President Trump’s wall costs less than the ObamaCare website — Let that sink in!"" reads the text of the post published by a group called Deplorables on March 20. We decided to do the math and arrived at the opposite conclusion. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) To compare the price tags, we broke down the costs for the border wall and healthcare.gov. During his campaign, Trump priced the border wall at $6-$7 billion. Then he said that it would cost $10-$12 billion. But recent estimates indicate that it will cost more — how much more depends on the design, materials, and distance it will cover. An internal report from the Department of Homeland Security described the barrier as a series of walls and fences that would cost $21.6 billion. Republican leadership estimated that the border wall would require $12-$15 billion. Senate Democrats predicted a $70 billion price tag for a border wall and patrolling technology. In his latest budget, Trump requested $8.6 billion in funding for the border wall in addition to the $12.9 billion that he could collect after declaring a national emergency. However, it’s important to know that these funds aren’t guaranteed. PolitiFact previously looked into the costs of healthcare.gov, the website set up by the Affordable Care Act. During a Senate hearing in May 2014, then-Department of Health and Human Services Secretary-designate Sylvia Mathews Burwell said the expenses totaled $834 million. Our reporting found that the most liberal estimate is $2.1 billion, which came from a Bloomberg Government study that captured expenses beyond the scope of Burwell’s estimate, including $387 million in other agencies’ spending and a $300 million contract to process paper applications. We tried to find out more about the origins of this comparison. Breitbart published a related, but not identical, article that said annual spending on Obamacare exceeds the highest estimates for the border wall costs. However, the article used the costs for the entire program, not just its website. It also mentions that the ""website alone cost over $2 billion"" and links to another Breitbart article on the Bloomberg Government study. Whatever cost of the border wall that you use — and it is vast, ranging from $12 billion to $70 billion — it far exceeds the cost of setting up the Obamacare website. The highest number we found for healthcare.gov was $2.1 billion.

NC sheriff right: ICE detainers are not valid warrants
","Those who recently watched Fox News’ ""The Ingraham Angle"" may have gotten the wrong idea about whether some North Carolina sheriffs are breaking the law by ignoring detainers issued by immigration authorities. Host Laura Ingraham on March 20 invited NC House Speaker Tim Moore, a Republican, to talk about a bill proposed by state lawmakers. Some North Carolina sheriffs are refusing to cooperatewith U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but the bill supported by Moore would require cooperation. Before Ingraham asks Moore a question (around the 21-minute mark of this video), she plays a video clip of a speech by Buncombe County Sheriff Quentin Miller. ""We do not make or enforce immigration laws,"" Miller says in the video. ""That is not part of our law enforcement duties. I will be attacked for this policy directive, maybe even by ICE. However, a detainer request is not a valid warrant."" Ingraham then asks Moore what he wants to say to the sheriff. Moore responds: ""Respectfully, I say that sheriff is wrong."" Viewers could get the impression from Moore’s response that Miller’s statement about ICE detainer requests is inaccurate. Joseph Kyzer, a spokesman for Moore, told PolitiFact that Moore was referring to Miller’s decision to not comply with ICE – not Miller’s statement about ICE detainers. ""The Speaker responded with his opinion of the sheriff’s stance on not cooperating with ICE, that he believes the sheriff is wrong to refuse such cooperation,"" Kyzer said in an email. ""The Speaker knows all too well that compliance with ICE is not currently required of sanctuary sheriffs under North Carolina law – that’s why he went on national television supporting legislation to do just that. "" To cut the confusion, we wanted to clarify the legal clout of ICE detainers. As it turns out, the Buncombe County sheriff’s claim is right. An ICE detainer request is a form or notice sent to law enforcement agencies alerting them that ICE wants custody of the person the local agency has jailed. A section of Homeland Security regulation empowers ""an authorized immigration officer"" to issue detainers to any law enforcement agency. The detainers ask the local agency to alert ICE that the person of interest will be released at least 48 hours before it happens. But, as a writer for the Lawfare blog pointed out in 2017, most courts have ruled that detainer compliance is voluntary. A list of related court decisions can be found on the website for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, an immigrant advocacy group. An ICE detainer request ""carries no legal force and does not authorize state and local officials to hold anyone in custody — it is not an arrest warrant and does not provide probable cause for arrest,"" Anil Kalhan, a law professor at the Thomas R. Kline School of Law at Drexel University, told PolitiFact in November. Kalhan’s statement echoes several federal court rulings. Apart from not being required to comply with a detainer request, sheriffs have other reasons for not wanting to – and they go beyond pure politics. First, some background. HOW IT WORKS When someone is arrested, their personal information usually goes into an FBI database at the National Crime Information Center. The database is accessible to many law enforcement agencies. But sometimes the information is inaccurate, said Bryan Cox, a spokesman for ICE’s southern region. ""Persons can – and do – give fraudulent identity information as well as fraudulent immigration information,"" Cox said in an email. ""Having access to a fingerprint is of little value unless the data it’s associated with is accurate."" So ICE prefers direct communication with local law enforcement agencies. Some agencies partner with ICE through its 287(g) program, which authorizes local law enforcement officers to perform immigration enforcement duties. And often, after an immigrant is arrested, ICE will issue a detainer and contact the agency that has jailed him or her. But some agencies ignore the detainers. Republicans have cited U.S. Code Section 1373 in trying to argue that local law enforcement agencies are breaking federal law by not complying with ICE. (It was mentioned in these PolitiFact fact checks of Sen. Steve Daines of Montana and former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions.) Section 1373 says federal, state or local government entities or officials may not prohibit or restrict the exchange of information with federal immigration officers regarding the citizenship or immigration status of any individual. But, as PolitiFact previously reported, at least three federal judges have found Section 1373 itself to be unconstitutional. (Those rulings applied to the jurisdictions specifically involved in litigation, not nationwide.) RISKS FOR SHERIFFS In some liberal counties, elected sheriffs are likely to face political pushback from voters for working with ICE. But there are legal and financial considerations too. Several courts have ruled that when a sheriff holds a person beyond the terms of their jail sentence to fulfill an ICE detainer request, it violates their civil rights. In a 2017 ruling on Ochoa v. Campbell, a U.S. District Court judge in Washington state noted that ""courts around the country have held that local law enforcement officials violate the Fourth Amendment when they temporarily detain individuals for immigration violations without probable cause."" Warrants and ICE detainers have ""wildly different"" procedural requirements, Kristie De Peña, director of immigration & senior counsel for the Niskanen Center, a nonprofit think tank with libertarian roots, wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Examiner. ""Whereas a warrant requires review by a judge, a valid ICE detainer is issued by any ICE officer who determines there is reason to believe an individual is an alien subject to removal,"" she wrote. ""This standard extends significant deference to immigration officials, whereas the Fourth Amendment warrant requirements extend protections to the individual."" Furthermore, local law enforcement agencies face significant financial liability when they honor ICE detainer requests. A recent ACLU fact-sheet listed 15 cases in which localities settled with defendants for tens and even hundreds of thousands of dollars. So, in North Carolina, ""it looks like our legislature, if [this bill] passes, may subject all of our county sheriffs and many police departments to the possibility of civil rights lawsuits,"" says Hans Linnartz, immigration attorney and former immigration law professor at Duke University Law School. OUR RULING Ingraham played a clip of Miller, who said an ICE detainer request ""is not a valid warrant."" Immediately after Miller’s statement, Ingraham asked Moore to respond and Moore said Miller was wrong. But the court system has mostly ruled that Miller is right. We rate this claim True.

No, the FBI did not say Michael Flynn did not lie, as Donald Trump said
","In his first interview since being cleared of criminally conspiring in Russia’s 2016 election interference, President Donald Trump did not rule out pardoning members of his campaign who were convicted as a result of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe.   Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, for example, pled guilty to intentionally making false statements to the FBI. But Trump claimed that the FBI actually found his campaign aide had not lied to agents. ""General Flynn, he was a man who had an incredible record in the military, you see what happened to him,"" Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity. ""The FBI said he wasn't lying, as I understand it, and if the Mueller group said he was lying, and you know what he has gone through, and what so many others have gone through."" In the waning days of his presidency, Barack Obama on Dec. 29, 2016, responded to Russia’s interference in the election by expelling 35 Russian diplomats and issuing new sanctions. Following Obama’s move against Russia, Flynn spoke to Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The special counsel established that Flynn asked Kislyak to ""refrain from escalating the situation."" Kislyak later said that Russia ""had chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of his request."" The next day, Putin announced that he would not retaliate against the Obama administration’s sanctions — a move that Trump praised later that day on Twitter: ""Great move on delay (by V. Putin),"" Trump tweeted. ""I always knew he was very smart!"" The following month, Flynn, who was at this point Trump’s national security adviser, spoke to the FBI agents. That’s when, according to the special counsel, Flynn falsely said he never discussed the Obama administration’s Russia sanctions with Kislyak. But apparently Flynn didn’t appear flustered or nervous when he lied to the FBI. A partially redacted FBI memo — known as a 302 — states that the FBI agents said Flynn ""did not give any indicators of deception."" During Michael Flynn’s sentencing phase, the special counsel reiterated the agents’ impression. This seems to be the basis for Trump’s claim. But Trump’s selective reading gives a false impression itself. Lawyers for the special counsel’s office said Flynn’s seemingly guileless demeanor did not change the fact that he was lying — which Flynn himself admitted. ""Those misimpressions do not change the fact — as the defendant has admitted in sworn testimony to this District Court — that he was indeed lying, and knowingly made false statements to FBI agents in a national security investigation,"" they wrote. In addition to lying about discussions he had with Kislyak about the Obama sanctions, Flynn also admitted to lying to FBI agents when he falsely told them he had not discussed having Russia help delay or defeat a vote on a United Nations Security Council resolution.   Trump said of his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, ""The FBI said he wasn't lying."" Trump is taking FBI agents’ impressions completely out of context. The agents who interviewed Flynn about his contacts with the Russian ambassador before Trump became president said he did not appear to be lying — meaning, he didn’t seem nervous or exhibit the usual traits of deception. That’s quite different from their factual conclusion: Flynn lied to them. Flynn pled guilty to intentionally making false statements and is awaiting sentencing.

Baldwin hits target with claim about states and comprehensive protections for LGBTQ people
","Congressional Democrats recently introduced the Equality Act, a bill aimed at expanding existing civil rights legislation to ban discrimination against LGBTQ people in employment, housing, education, credit and other aspects of life. In arguing for the measure, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin noted that in much of the country there is little legal protection for such individuals. Baldwin was the first openly gay member of the Senate. In 2018, U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona became the first bisexual member. The two are the body’s only LGBTQ members. ""The Equality Act recognizes the fact that more than half of the states in the United States do not have legal protections for people preventing or giving them the tools to fight back against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity,"" Baldwin told Jonathan Van Ness on the March 12, 2019 episode of his ""Getting Curious"" podcast. Specifically, Baldwin claimed that 29 states lack ""comprehensive protections"" for LGBTQ individuals. In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that bans on gay marriage were unconstitutional. And Wisconsin has included protections from discrimination against sex and sexual orientation since 1982, becoming the first state to enact these laws. (Wisconsin did not go as far to fully protect transgender people, as PolitiFact Wisconsin found in 2015.) Is Baldwin right about other states?
  The Equality Act proposal The Equality Act was first introduced in the House in 2015 and is an updated version of one introduced in 1974, which aimed to extend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit discrimination on the account of ""sex, marital status, or sexual orientation in places of public accommodation."" The new version extends the 1974 law to add gender identity, defining it ""as gender-related identity, appearance, mannerisms, or characteristics, regardless of the individual’s designated sex at birth,"" which would include transgender individuals. The places where discrimination is specifically prohibited are also extended, adding in gyms, stores, banks, travel agencies and more. Supporters of the measure say it’s a step toward full equality for the LGBTQ community, while some conservative opponents say the bill is a threat to religious liberty and free speech -- particularly for those who choose to run businesses in accordance with their religious beliefs. The state of the states As of today, 21 states and Washington D.C. have laws that prohibit discrimination against sexual orientation and gender identity, according to Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit advocacy group for equal rights. The group compiled its data from existing state statutes. Wisconsin prohibits sexual orientation discrimination but doesn’t go as far to address gender identity. Thus, it is not counted among the 21. Of course, if 21 states have such protections, then 29 would not. ""Currently, federal anti-discrimination statutes such as Title VII (Civil Rights Act of 1964) which prohibits discrimination in the employment context do not on their face prohibit sexual orientation or gender identity discrimination,"" said Adam Romero, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law. ""The statutes don't say the words sexual orientation or gender identity."" Thus, as it stands, LGBTQ individuals living in states that have anti-discrimination laws have stronger civil rights protections than those who don’t. Some may also be covered by city or county ordinances that prohibit discrimination. Indeed, those living in states without such provisions face even less protection. ""If you live in California, you have protections from employment discrimination or Nevada or New Mexico and these other states,"" Romero said. ""But, if you live in Texas or Oklahoma or Florida, or the many other states without these state statutes, you are not protected under state law from discrimination (based on) sexual orientation or gender identity under these state statutes. ""The Equality Act would benefit all LGBTQ people across the country but it would be especially beneficial to those living in states without state level protections.""
  Our rating Baldwin claimed 29 states don’t have comprehensive protections for LGBTQ people. The number is on the money, based on our conversation with Romero and other researched data on state statutes.

Here's what's known about Fred Trump's arrest after a KKK clash
","Side-by-side photographs on Facebook of President Donald Trump and his father Fred Trump attempt to show a family pattern of white supremacy. ""Donald Trump: A white supremacist...just like dad,"" reads large text in a post shared by the group Anti-Trump USA on Feb. 25. On Donald Trump's side, the post highlights his partial quote from a news conference that there were ""fine people on both sides"" after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Beneath a photo of Fred Trump, the text states he was ""arrested participating in KKK riot"" in 1927. The post contains some elements of truth about Fred Trump: He was arrested that year in connection with a clash between the KKK and police amid a parade in Queens. But the post goes beyond what is known about his actions to say he was ""participating."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A spokesman for the White House did not comment for the story. The story of Fred Trump’s arrest at a KKK rally has challenged reporters even before his son entered the 2016 presidential race. The KKK riot broke out during the May 30, 1927, Memorial Day parade in Jamaica, Queens, N.Y., according to archives from The Brooklyn Daily Eagle. A week prior, police commissioner Joseph Warren was warned that the Klan intended to parade in hoods and gowns. Warren said they were not issued a permit to have a parade, but a report later said the KKK had permission from the Grand Army of the Republic, a veterans’ organization that had charge of the parade arrangements. However, on the day of the parade, police were unable to keep at least 1,000 Klansmen from participating. The New York Times stated that ""1,000 Klansmen and 100 policemen staged a free-for-all battle in Jamaica."" Fred Trump, then 21, was arrested at the parade along with six others, according to the New York Times. (His address was listed as 175-25 Devonshire Road, Jamaica, which matched the 1930 Census.) However, unlike the other men arrested who faced various charges of assault and disorderly conduct, the Times reported that Trump ""was discharged."" We checked other reports of the riot to find more information — and found some discrepancies. A May 31, 1927, Brooklyn Daily Eagle article named six prisoners and all but one, bystander Ralph Losee, were called ""avowed Klansmen"" by the police. But this article did not mention Trump's name.  According to the Daily Star, Trump was ""dismissed on a charge of refusing to disperse from a parade when ordered to do so."" A June 2, 1927, Long Island Daily Press article said ""seven of the berobed marchers"" were arrested. So Fred Trump might have been wearing a Klansman robe. Alberto Martinez, a history professor at University of Texas, Austin, wrote his own in-depth report on Fred’s arrest. ""Even if Fred Trump was involved in the riot, it doesn’t necessarily mean that he was a KKK member or marcher, because news reports and court records both specify that local spectators (men and women) got involved in disrupting the parade,"" Martinez wrote in an email. Additionally, he said, Fred Trump was the only one arrested who was promptly released without any charges. Martinez said the disposition of the police officers also made him question whether Fred Trump was involved. ""The Queens County Grand Jury accused the police ‘for the disgraceful assault not only upon the (KKK) marchers but innocent civilians along the line of the march’ in the parade,"" Martinez wrote. A police car hit and seriously injured Losee, the innocent bystander who was arrested, and several minors were injured by the police. The president of the Grand Jurors’ Association of Queens said, ""Atrocities were committed by the police which were unwarranted and which should be condemned."" ""These points show that the police clashed not only with Klansmen but with innocent spectators, which again calls into question whether Fred Trump was necessarily a KKK marcher or a local spectator,"" Martinez wrote. A picture on Facebook claims Fred Trump was arrested for ""participating"" a KKK riot. Yes, Trump's father was arrested in connection with the KKK's appearance at a Memorial Day parade. The group's march led to a violent confrontation with police. However, there is not enough documentation to show Trump was participating. Unlike other men who were arrested that day, his charge was quickly dropped.  The post stretches what is known about the events that day to leave a misleading impression.

Kamala Harris is wrong, Trump isn’t ‘raiding money’ from military pensions
","California Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has sharply criticized President Trump for his plans to divert military funds to pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump in February declared a national emergency on the border to access billions of dollars that Congress refused to give him to build the wall. One of Harris’ recent attacks caught our attention: She claimed the Trump administration was ""raiding money"" from the military pensions of service members to pay for the barrier. ""Members of our military have already given so much. Raiding money from their pensions to fund the President’s wasteful vanity project is outrageous. Our servicemembers deserve better,"" Harris said on March 8 on Twitter and Facebook. Is the Trump administration really planning to raid military pensions? FactCheck.org, along with some social media users who commented on Harris’ posts, described her claim as misleading or wrong. We decided to fact-check her provocative statement ourselves. Background on Trump’s national emergency declaration  Democratic leaders have called Trump’s emergency declaration a power grab, and some Republicans also said it sets a dangerous precedent. The move allows the president to transfer $3.6 billion from military construction projects to the wall, according to the White House. It also gives him the ability to tap $2.5 billion from drug interdiction programs and $600 million from a Treasury Department asset forfeiture fund. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement in February: ""The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available."" The House and Senate voted this month to block the declaration. Trump vetoed the joint resolution shortly after. A bid to override the veto failed this week in the House. Sixteen states, including California, have filed a federal lawsuit challenging Trump’s authority to divert funds for the border wall. Examining Harris’ claim To support her statement, Harris linked in her social media posts to a March 7 Associated Press article. Reading just the headline -- ""Pentagon may tap military pay, pensions for border wall"" -- Harris’ claim seems mostly accurate. But the first paragraph describes the money as ""leftover funds,"" casts a different light. The Pentagon is planning to tap $1 billion in leftover funds from military pay and pension accounts to help President Donald Trump pay for his long-sought border wall, a top Senate Democrat said Thursday. The money is available because the Army missed a recruitment goal by 6,500 enlistees. Additionally, fewer soldiers opted to take financial incentives for voluntary early retirement, according to the article. The Pentagon plans to move the extra money to its drug interdiction account, freeing it up to spend on border barriers, the AP reported. Experts say claim misses the mark To further assess Harris’ claim of raiding pensions, we spoke with three experts on federal defense budgets. Each said the senator’s statement was inaccurate. ""It’s off-base,"" said Todd Harrison, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan, nonprofit policy research organization. He said the money is leftover in certain Army personnel accounts. ""It’s a separate issue worth debating whether that money should be used for the border wall or should be used for other purposes within the military. But the fact that they’re moving money out of these accounts is not an indication that anyone is cutting military pay or cutting benefits or pension payments. That’s not the case."" No military service member’s pension would be reduced, he said. Mark Cancian, who worked for the White House Office of Management and Budget on defense budget strategy during the Obama administration, agreed that Harris’ statement is wrong. ""The answer is, ‘No.’ They are not raiding military pensions,"" Cancian said. ""I’m sure the Army had some places they would have preferred to send that money. But they are not taking any money from pensions."" Cancian is now a senior advisor with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Travis Sharp directs the budget program at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, which provides independent defense budget analysis. He also said Harris’ statement is flawed. ""This is another example of there being a lot of confusion about what it means to cut something in the budget,"" Sharp said. Transferring money after an agency overestimated how much something would cost is not the same as a cut, he said. ""The Department of Defense has to budget in advance for things that are unpredictable,"" Sharp said. ""The money that’s leftover is what the Trump administration is trying to reallocate. Does that constitute a cut? In my opinion, no. That’s not a cut."" When the Pentagon has funds remaining in one account, it can ""reprogram"" the money to others, such as a health care or fuel accounts that have a budget shortfall, Cancian said. If that doesn’t happen, Congress ""will rescind that money and use it for other purposes,"" Harrison, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said. The Department of Defense did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Harris campaign provided a written statement: ""The AP reported that money is being transferred from a fund dedicated to pensions of armed service members. The President is trying to circumvent Congress who refused to give him funding for this wall by diverting resources from other military funds."" The spokesperson would not say whether the senator stood by the original claim. Our rating Sen. Kamala Harris claimed the Trump administration was ""raiding money"" from the military pensions of service members to pay for the wall. In reality, the Pentagon plans to move leftover pay and retirement funds that are available because fewer soldiers opted for an early retirement program and because the Army missed a recruitment goal by 6,500 enlistees. No service members would lose pay or retirement benefits as a result of the move, according to experts on federal defense budgets. The headline in the article Harris relied on did not make this clear. But it’s important for anyone, especially a public official, to read beyond a headline before making such a claim. The debate over whether the Trump administration should tap this money is a separate issue. Harris’ claim was off-the-mark. We rate it False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Yes, more people are uninsured since Donald Trump took office, but be leery of specific numbers
","The Trump administration’s decision to ask a federal court to declare the entire Affordable Care Act unconstitutional has fired up Democrats. By one estimate, about 20 million people rely on the law for their health care. Presidential candidate Julian Castro, who served as Housing and Urban Development secretary in the Obama administration, said President Donald Trump’s latest move comes on top of his broader policy to undermine the signature health care program of President Barack Obama. ""Donald Trump is doubling down on a health care agenda that has left millions more Americans uninsured since he took office,"" Castro tweeted March 26. ""As President, I will expand access to quality health care, and make universal coverage my first legislative priority."" In this fact-check, we focused on whether millions more people are uninsured since Trump took office. Castro’s staff pointed to the results in the January 2019 Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index. It said 13.7 percent of Americans were uninsured in the last quarter of 2018. ""Today's level is the highest in more than four years, and well above the low point of 10.9 percent reached in 2016,"" the report said. ""The 2.8-percentage-point increase since that low represents a net increase of about seven million adults without health insurance."" So that squares with Castro’s ""millions,"" but we’ve found before that Gallup is an outlier, largely because its estimate for the uninsured was lower than anyone’s in 2016. From that low point, any increase appears larger. So we kept looking for more sources. According to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2016 and the first nine months of 2018, the number of uninsured rose 1.3 million. That number comes from the National Health Interview Survey, a long-standing research program that drew responses from a pool of more than 61,000 people. ""The National Health Interview Survey is the gold standard in terms of measuring health insurance enrollment at the national level,"" RAND health policy analyst Christine Eibner said. ""My only caveat is that the most recent data do not incorporate the elimination of the individual mandate penalty, which took effect on Jan. 1, 2019. So, it’s possible that we will see further erosion."" Republicans lifted the requirement for everyone to have insurance as part of the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act. Chris Condeluci, a former Republican Senate committee staffer on health care benefits, also trusts the CDC data. ""There’s a slight uptick in the number of uninsured,"" Condeluci said. ""A slight uptick isn’t millions, but you can't shy away from the fact that there are now some people who are uninsured who had insurance in 2016."" The government’s survey found that the uninsured rate rose from 12.4 percent in 2016 to 13 percent in September 2018. The CDC analysts have not said the increase is statistically significant. On the other hand, the latest results are preliminary, and the CDC authors noted that ""preliminary estimates of persons without health insurance coverage are generally 0.1 to 0.3 percentage points lower than the final estimates."" In short, the best available survey shows a rise in the number of uninsured, and it’s possible the uninsurance rate will be higher when the final numbers come out. The New York-based Commonwealth Fund, a private health policy group, also measures insurance coverage. Based on its work, about 2 million people lost health coverage under Trump. A large research effort by the Urban Institute has found small but statistically significant signs that progress toward wider coverage has stalled and might be reversing. The Census Bureau’s ""Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2017"" analysis showed an increase of the uninsured of 492,000 people between 2017 and 2016. That’s only for one year, but the trend is upward. Whatever the rise in the number of uninsured, Castro broadly ties the trend to Republican policies. There’s no question that Trump and congressional Republicans worked hard and nearly repealed Obamacare. Trump canceled about $10 billion in reimbursements to insurance companies, a move that drove up premiums, although since then, they’ve moderated. The administration tightened the screws on enrollment, by shortening the sign-up period and cutting the marketing budget by 90 percent. However, enrollment for Obamacare plans fell only 2.6 percent between 2018 and 2019. Total sign-ups were over 11.4 million. ""Trump and Congress took many actions that could have an upward effect on the uninsured rate,"" said Cynthia Cox with the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""But the actual effect of Trump Administration policies on the uninsured rate is still an open question."" Castro said that millions more people are uninsured as a result of Trump’s policies. One poll did estimate a jump of 7 million people without health insurance. But the most trusted government survey found a smaller increase of 1.3 million. Whatever the role of Republican policies, there’s broad agreement that the number has gone up. Castro said it was millions. The best data says it’s closer to 1.3 million. Castro has the trend right, but the numbers don’t quite back him up on the specifics. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A300180>],/factchecks/2019/mar/28/julian-castro/rise-uninsured-under-trump-tops-1-million-beware-e/

No, Adam Schiff did not use taxpayer funds for a sexual harassment settlement
","Politicians are known to be frequent targets for conspiracy rumors and scandals. Lately, conspiracy theory peddlers have set their sights on U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat who represents California’s 28th Congressional District and recently took over as chair of the House Intelligence Committee. A March 21 Facebook post displays a picture of Schiff with wide eyes and says: ""Adam Schiff used taxpayer money to reach sexual harassment settlement with a 19 year old male. Retweet if you are sick of this disgraceful hypocrite trashing our president."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence that Schiff paid off anyone over sexual harassment allegations, let alone used taxpayer funds to do it. We found the rumor posted all over Twitter, and one December 9, 2018 tweet in particular from a QAnon conspiracy theory account, which simply claimed the information came from ""congressional sources,"" was picked up and retweeted tens of thousands of times. The rumor seems have emerged as Congress worked toward the bipartisan passage of a bill that requires members to pay their own sex misconduct settlements. The rumor stretched so far that it was found in a Letter to the Editor in the Washington Times on Dec. 13, 2018. That account also failed to list any sources to back up the allegation. A spokesperson for Schiff told PolitiFact the conspiracy theory is completely false: ""This false smear originated four months ago on a QAnon conspiracy account. It is obviously and categorically untrue."" Going back a bit further, we discovered a story about a supposed ""gay lover"" of Schiff’s on the junk news website TheNetSpies from February 2018. The site is filled with questionable content, and its ""About Us"" page states its content comes in ""the form of sizzling OP-ED, hard nosed investigative journalism, and a bit of satire for laughs."" The story claimed to have had an exclusive interview with former Los Angeles Times assistant managing editor Christina Bellantoni (which they misspelled as ""Kristina Bellatori""). In a supposed Skype interview, Bellantoni allegedly told the site a man named ""Will Bottom"" claimed to be in an abusive relationship with Schiff. The NetSpies posted a picture of the abused man, but the photo is actually of Taj Patterson, a Brooklyn man who was beaten in 2013. Bellantoni got wind of the story months later (around the time the rumor was spreading across Twitter) and called it out as fake in a tweet. ""Thanks for flagging. This is some very seriously fake news,"" Bellantoni wrote. ""Clue No. 1: A website you’ve never heard of citing an LAT story that doesn’t exist."" Thanks for flagging. This is some very seriously fake news. Clue No. 1: A website you’ve never heard of citing an LAT story that doesn’t exist. https://t.co/FMUsft3ilx Viral social media posts claim that Schiff used taxpayer money to settle a sexual harassment allegation with a ""a 19-year-old male."" Despite the rapid spreading of the rumor, not a single credible news source picked up the story.

No, Trump didn't sign a bill this month to clean up oceans
","Between the Mueller report and efforts to undo the Affordable Care Act, is President Donald Trump taking on marine trash? ""President Trump signed legislation to clean up millions of tons of trash from our oceans and lakes last week,"" reads the text of a Facebook post published on March 21, 2019. ""But the media won’t report on that… ever."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We’ve checked a similar claim before. In late January, an article posted to Facebook claimed that Trump had signed a bill ""to clean millions of tons of garbage from the world’s oceans."" The story was referring to the Save Our Seas Act of 2018, which Trump signed on Oct. 11. He then said that more than 8 million tons of garbage is dumped into oceans every year and that the law ""will help address this problem."" But Jordana Merran, communications manager for Ocean Conservancy, a nonprofit that supported the Save Our Seas Act and celebrated its passage, said it’s not accurate to summarize the legislation as a bill to ""clean millions of tons of garbage from the world’s oceans."" Rather, the law Trump signed reauthorizes ""the longstanding amount of $10 million annually"" for NOAA’s Marine Debris Program, she said. ""The program does support, among other efforts, Ocean Conservancy’s International Coastal Cleanup, in which volunteers collect millions of pounds of garbage off beaches and waterways annually across the globe. However, many entities provide financial support for the ICC."" The legislation, which was sponsored by U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and cosponsored by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, had bipartisan support. It doesn’t direct the country to clean millions of tons of garbage from marine environments. The bill reauthorizes and amends the Marine Debris Act ""to promote international action to reduce marine debris, and for other purposes,"" according to the law. But it’s not specific about how much debris, or how it should be cleaned up. Did Trump sign another bill earlier in March? ""No,"" said Madeline Black, a communications assistant for Ocean Conservancy. ""This likely is the same claim as in February being shared belatedly."" When we reviewed the original claim about this legislation, we rated it Half True. That’s because Trump signed a bill that reauthorized a program aimed in part at removing marine water debris. This more recent Facebook post makes a similar claim but it goes on step further, wrongly stating that Trump signed the legislation this month.
