Krugman calls Senate health care bill similar to law in Massachusetts
","The recent Massachusetts Senate election captivated Americans far beyond the Bay State. In that contest, Republican Scott Brown picked up a seat formerly held by the late Democratic giant Edward Kennedy. Brown's upset victory was aided by a wave of frustration over how Congress and President Barack Obama have been handling health care reform legislation.During the campaign, Brown said that if he was elected, he would become the 41st Republican senator, enabling the GOP to block the Democratic majority from reaching the 60-vote threshold required to pass key legislation, including a health care bill. The Senate has already passed a version of health care, but it needs to be reconciled with a different bill passed by the House and then signed by the president before it becomes law.As it happened, Massachusetts passed its own health care reform plan in 2006, with the help of both Republican Gov. Mitt Romney and a heavily Democratic legislature. Brown, then serving in the state Senate, voted for the plan.On the Jan. 31, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, host Barbara Walters asked Brown about his vote on the Massachusetts plan. ""Why isn't what's good for Massachusetts good for the whole country?"" she asked.Brown responded, ""In Massachusetts, the free market, the free enterprise has taken control, and they're offering a wide range of plans. I've never ever said that people should not get health insurance. It's just a question of if we're going to take a one-size-fits-all government plan or we're going to do something where the individual states can tailor their plans as we've done.""When Walters asked him, ""Do you think the whole plan should be scrapped?"" Brown said, ""Yes.""""The whole plan?"" Walters continued.""Yes,"" Brown said.Later, during the show's round-table segment, liberal New York Times columnist Paul Krugman expressed disbelief at Brown's response.""That was the most evasive answer,"" Krugman said. ""If you think this is a straightforward guy, that was an incredibly evasive answer on health care, because the Senate bill, which has now stalled, is identical to the Massachusetts health care plan -- the same thing. Only in the finest of fine print is there any difference. He voted for the Massachusetts plan. A majority of voters in Massachusetts who voted for him approve of the Massachusetts health care plan. Nonetheless, their plan is dead.""We wanted to see whether the Massachusetts plan was indeed ""the same thing"" as the bill passed by the U.S. Senate. So we looked at the details of both plans and consulted with an ideologically diverse group of health policy experts.The consensus among our experts was that Krugman is basically right on the overall structure, although some of the details differ. As Elizabeth A. McGlynn, associate director of RAND Health, put it, ""Same recipe, different amounts on the ingredients.""Here are elements of the two plans that are broadly the same, along with some of the differences in details:• Individual mandate to buy health insurance. Everyone in Massachusetts must purchase health insurance or else pay a penalty; the same goes for the Senate plan, though the penalty structures vary between the two.• Employer responsibilities for offering health insurance. Companies with more than 10 employees in Massachusetts need to offer health insurance or else pay a penalty. The Senate bill sets the bar for companies at 50 employees, though technically the bill falls short of a mandate.• Health insurance exchanges. Both the Massachusetts and U.S. Senate plans involve the use of voluntary ""exchanges"" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. These exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels.• Affordability subsidies. Under both plans, lower-income individuals and families can receive government subsidies to help them pay their health insurance premiums. In the Massachusetts plan, subsidies are allotted on a sliding scale up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Under the U.S. Senate plan, the sliding-scale subsidies go up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level.• Expansion of Medicaid. The Massachusetts plan expands Medicaid to all children up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. The U.S. Senate plan also expands Medicaid, but in a different fashion, offering it to all individuals (not just children) up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level.• Insurance market regulation. Both plans restructure the insurance market, in similar but slightly different ways. In Massachusetts, the reform bill merged the individual and small-group markets (that is, it merged the market serving individuals not covered by their employer's plan with the market serving smaller employers). The U.S. Senate bill placed new regulations on those two markets but kept them separate. In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 can be covered on their parents' plan, while the U.S. Senate bill allows such dependent coverage up to age 26. And young adults in Massachusetts from age 19 to 26 can purchase a special lower-cost, lower-benefit plan through the exchange; the U.S. Senate bill creates a category of lower-cost, lower-benefit plan in the exchange for those up to age 30 who cannot find affordable coverage.• Limits on the ratio between the highest and lowest premiums. In Massachusetts, the highest premiums can generally only be twice as high as the lowest premiums. The only factors that can be used to vary premiums are age, tobacco use, geographic area, the nature of the employee's industry, an unusually low participation rate (for group plans) and participation in a wellness plan. The U.S. Senate bill allows premiums in the individual and small-group market and on the exchange to vary based only on age (limited to a 3-to-1 ratio), geographic area, family composition and tobacco use (limited to 1.5 -to-1 ratio). Wellness programs do not factor into ratings variations under the Senate bill, but the bill does provide other incentives for such plans.The bills differ more noticeably in several other areas.• Cost containment. Critics of the Massachusetts plan have taken it to task for its lack of cost-containment provisions. The U.S. Senate bill makes changes to Medicare that are intended to lower program costs, such as restructuring how payments are made to Medicare Advantage plans -- the HMO option under Medicare. Since Medicare is a federal program, the Massachusetts plan does not address this issue. The U.S. Senate bill also authorizes the Food and Drug Administration to approve generic versions of certain drugs. This, too, is a federal rather than a state responsibility.• Financing. Both the Massachusetts plan and the Senate bill are financed in part by revenue generated from the individual and employer mandates. But the Massachusetts plan's financing is heavily dependent on leveraging federal matching funds, while the Senate bill, in addition to cost savings from Medicare, imposes taxes on drugmakers, device manufacturers, health insurers and indoor tanning services. It also taxes high-cost (""Cadillac"") health care plans. The Massachusetts plan does not do any of these things.""The Senate probably has more cost containment,"" said John Holahan, a health expert at the Urban Institute who has studied the Massachusetts plan extensively. ""And the financing is different. But the structure is the same.""So it seems that there's broad agreement that, despite some operational differences, the broad structure of the Massachusetts health care plan is quite similar to that in the U.S. Senate bill -- certainly more similar than either one is to, say, a single-payer health care plan or even to the current system. Krugman's comparison of the two plans is Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/feb/04/paul-krugman/krugman-calls-senate-health-care-bill-similar-law-/

Kay Bailey Hutchison ad pours out headlines casting Gov. Rick Perry as beholden to special interests
","
U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, seeking the Republican nomination for governor, unleashed a TV commercial Feb. 4 casting Gov. Rick Perry as beholden to special interests and lobbyists, including two who served as his top gubernatorial assistants. 
The ad flashes what look like seven ominous newspaper headlines about Perry before a narrator says: ""There are two ways to get things done in Austin. Hire a lobbyist and donate to this governor. Or elect a new one."" 
We wondered if Hutchison’s ""New One"" ad accurately reflected original headlines and news stories. (For this Truth-O-Meter item, we are focusing on Hutchison's use of the headlines — a common campaign technique. We are not assessing the accuracy of those articles or her overall Perry critique.)

Hutchison spokesman Joe Pounder initially said every headline in the ad matched original published headlines. He later said the ad presents ""pull quotes,"" meaning excerpts from articles and not necessarily the original headlines.

Using Nexis, an electronic news retrieval service, we found that four of the quotations presented in Hutchison’s ad were identical to published headlines on news stories. Hutchison’s campaign showed that a fifth also was correct. The correctly quoted headlines are: ""Perry to Name Lobbyist As New Chief of Staff;"" ""Lobbyists Revolving In, Out of Perry Staff Positions;"" ""Perry Shakes Down Special Interests, Lobbyists;"" ""Companies That Gave to Perry Got Road Contract;"" and ""Perry’s Top Donors Get Business.""

We noticed, though, that the headline about Perry shaking down special interests topped an editorial—not a news story—published in The Houston Chronicle about Perry in July 2000. At the time, Perry was lieutenant governor. He succeeded George W. Bush as governor in late 2000.

The Chronicle editorial questioned a Perry letter asking lobbyists to buy $1,000 tickets to an upcoming political fund-raiser. Perry, the newspaper opined, ""has just made it abundantly clear that he knows no bounds when it comes to shaking down special interests with business before the Texas Legislature.""

According to the editorial, Perry's letter asked lobbyists to specify how much money each of their corporate and group clients would be sending the lieutenant governor's way—potentially fostering illegal corporate donations or encouraging lobbyists to see links between donations and state business, the newspaper said. ""With his latest fund-raising letter holding legislative lobbyists responsible for money contributed by their clients, Perry explicitly links campaign money to business before the Legislature,"" the editorial states.

Two of the headline-like quotations in Hutchison’s ad were not previously published headlines on news articles: ""Perry’s Former Chief of Staff is A Lobbyist for Merck"" and ""A Shroud of Secrecy Has Descended on the Governor’s Office."" (The published headlines for those articles: ""Reluctant governor yields on HPV shots; Calling a veto useless, Perry chides legislators for reversing his vaccination order"" and ""Perry refusal to release memo nothing new, He cites attorney-client privilege, this time in the execution controversy."")

We confirmed, though, that the two quotations presented to look like headlines accurately reflected portions of the related news articles.

It’s not unusual for campaign ads to present excerpts from newspaper stories as a stream of headlines. It’s also not rare for a candidate to quote an editorial as news reportage, even though editorials are opinion pieces.

Still, a voter could conclude that Hutchison’s ad consists entirely of genuine clear-cut news headlines. That’s not so.

We give her use of the headlines a rating of Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/feb/04/kay-bailey-hutchison/kay-bailey-hutchison-ad-pours-out-headlnes-casting/

Farouk Shami says Bill White is discriminating, taking jobs from blacks to give to friends
","
Farouk Shami of Houston, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, recently made a pointed charge about his key Democratic opponent, according to an online post by the Dallas Morning News. Referring to former Houston Mayor Bill White, Shami said Jan. 26: ""He is discriminating. He’s taking jobs from African-Americans and giving them to his friends.""

Such an assertion could pack a wallop in the Democratic primary, where African Americans are traditionally a vital voting bloc.

We tried to get the goods on Shami's provocative claim — starting with our confusion over Shami's speaking as if White, who is no longer Houston's mayor, could currently be handing out city jobs while stumping for governor.

Shami spokeswoman Kelly Johnson told us that Shami spoke in the present tense because that’s his typical speech pattern.

She also pointed us to a nearly year-old Houston Chronicle article that quoted critics of the Houston city department that's responsible for ensuring that companies doing business with the city do all they can to subcontract with businesses helmed by women, minorities and the disadvantaged. In the Feb. 12 article, Houston City Councilman Jarvis Johnson said the 25-year-old the Minority Women Disadvantaged Business Enterprise, or MWDBE, program should improve or be scrapped. More criticism came from City Councilman Ron Green, who said the program to certify businesses as MWDBEs employed a process ""to keep individuals from getting certified.""

The article also noted it is common practice among local governments to assist and promote the use of businesses owned by women, minorities and people with disabilities in city contracting efforts. 
White, whose tenure as mayor ran from 2004 through December, is quoted saying the certification process ""can always be improved."" He suggested the city create a simple system making it easier to determine if paperwork has sat too long on someone’s desk or whether a complaint is legitimate, the Chronicle reported. 
Velma Laws, director of the city’s Affirmative Action and Contract Compliance Department, recently told us it takes the department an average of 30 days to process an application for certification, compared to the 90 days required by federal authorities. 
Nothing in the article speaks directly to Shami’s claim that White discriminated, taking jobs from black residents to give to friends.

We sought outside insights into how black-led firms fared on White's watch.

Thomas Jones, an African American Houston CPA and member of the Across the Track political action committee, told us the city affirmative action contracting program is sometimes perceived as not pushing hard enough for the hiring of historically disadvantaged firms. ""We’ve had a number of members complain about the lack of advocacy on the part of the department as opposed to being there to make sure you dot all your I’s and cross your T’s,"" Jones said. ""It probably could be some(thing) more advocacy minded.""

Jones said, however, he didn't notice any dropoff in minority opportunities while White was mayor. Nor did Jones sense racial discrimination coming from White, whose top aides included black and Hispanic residents. ""I’ve always found White to be pretty fair,"" Jones said. ""I would never ever say that Bill White is even remotely a racist ... That's just not true.""

The chairman of a Houston group representing black-owned businesses told us that some African American professionals believe they did not have the contracting opportunities under White that they enjoyed under his predecessor as mayor, Lee Brown. Carroll Robinson, chairman of the Houston Citizens Chamber of Commerce, said that his group is going to study whether there's a legitimate basis for that concern.

We took our own look at contracts under the affirmative action program when White was mayor compared to contracts under his immediate predecessors as mayor, Brown and Bob Lanier.

Through the program, the dollar amount of contracts awarded to businesses helmed by minorities, women or the disadvantaged increased from $809,000 under Lanier to nearly $1.3 million under Brown to $1.45 million under White. But the share of contracts in city projects credited to black-owned businesses dropped on White's watch to 15.3 percent. Under Brown, 20.1 percent of contracts monitored by the program went to black-owned businesses; under Lanier, it was 21 percent. The share of contracts awarded to Hispanic-owned businesses rose from 33 percent under Lanier and Brown to 34.5 percent under White, while the share of contracts awarded to Asian-owned businesses went from 14 percent under Lanier to 18 percent under Brown to 15 percent under White.

White campaign spokeswoman Katy Bacon pointed out that 10 percent of contracts monitored by the program hadn't been finalized by the time White left office. As each one is executed, she suggested, the share of contracts awarded within each racial category could change.

White stressed that the affirmative action program statistics do not capture all contracts awarded to minority-owned firms, including some awarded in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. ""We are very proud of our record,"" White said.

Johnson of Shami's campaign told us that Shami’s statement in Dallas reflected ""the way many African Americans, Hispanics, and other minorities in the city of Houston feel about Bill White's tenure as mayor. He hired as his top staffers Republicans close to indicted former U.S. House Majority leader Tom DeLay (R-Sugar Land) and helped alter city policy in such a way that promoted contracts being let in larger blocks, thus resulting in less minority contractors being hired directly by the city.""

Johnson singled out White’s February 2004 hiring of Ann Travis as the Mayor’s Director for Government Affairs. A city press release stated that Travis had worked for seven years as district director for Rep. DeLay. White also supplemented her city pay with money from his campaign kitty, the Chronicle has reported.

Johnson said the Chronicle had printed multiple articles in 2004 and 2005 about White, his DeLay connection and hires beyond Travis. Our search of the Chronicle for 2004-05 came up empty.

Under White, a smaller share of black-owned businesses got contracts through the city program devoted to fostering affirmative action. It may also be that White fed perceptions that he was trimming opportunities for black-owned businesses.

But Shami's claim is an overreach, unsupported by even his own campaign's back-up evidence.

We rate Shami's statement as Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/feb/04/farouk-shami/farouk-shami-says-bill-white-discriminating-taking/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Scott Brown']","
In PolitiFact debut, Brown says federal jobs pay twice as much as private sector jobs
","Only 12 days after his upset victory in Massachusetts, Republican Sen.-elect Scott Brown made his debut on the Sunday morning talk circuit.He talked about health care, the war in Afghanistan and deficit reduction in an interview with Barbara Walters on the Jan. 31, 2010 episode of This Week. Brown encouraged President Barack Obama to put a freeze on federal position hires and raises because, ""as you know, federal employees are making twice as much as their private counterparts.""Federal jobs don't exactly have a reputation for bringing in big bucks, so we were curious about Brown's claim. Before we get into his statement, it's useful to understand how the government sets salaries. Trade, craft and laboring workers are paid according to the Federal Wage System, which pegs pay to local prevailing rates. Salaries for white-collar employees are set under a separate pay system that determines salaries by comparing government positions to similar jobs in the private sector. Increasingly, some agencies and departments are using pay schemes that are more closely tied to performance rather than tenure, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and these workers are generally paid more.It turns out that Brown has talked about federal employee pay before. On Jan. 4, before he was elected, Brown called for a temporary pay freeze for federal workers. ""I recognize that our federal workers do important work, but it’s not right that lesser-paid private sector workers suffering through a recession have to pay for expensive government salaries,” he said, citing numbers from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank. In August 2009, Cato published an analysis of wage statistics from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a branch of the U.S. Commerce Department. According to those numbers, the average wage for 1.9 million federal civilian workers was $79,197, compared to $50,028 for the nation’s 108 million private-sector workers. (The analysis leaves out combat military personnel on the theory that there aren't equivalent jobs in the private sector.)Chris Edwards, the director of tax policy studies at Cato who wrote the analysis, later said it generated some controversy. Some critics said that the federal work force is generally more skilled than, say, people who work in the service industry. So naturally, the average would be higher. (Edwards acknowledged that was ""an important factor to consider,"" but said the increase in federal wages has much steeper than the private sector. ""Has the composition of the federal work force really changed that much in just eight years to justify such a big relative gain? I doubt it."")Secondly, some critics argued that an average is not especially useful when comparing private and public-sector salaries.John Palguta, vice president of public policy for the Partnership for Public Service, a group that urges people to work in government, told us that a more useful comparison is to look at specific jobs in the public and private sectors and see how they compare. For example, he said, federal doctors and nurses typically do not make as much as they could in private jobs. We checked a variety of sources for apples-to-apples comparisons and found a variety of results. One study came from the Federal Salary Council, an advisory group of labor relations experts and representatives of federal employee unions that helps the U.S. Office of Personnel Management set wage rates. It found that for comparable private and public jobs such as lawyers, public sector employees are paid on average 26 percent less than private sector counterparts. When we checked individual jobs using the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics employment data (from 2008), we found many federal salaries were indeed higher, but some were lower. Higher: A government-employed nurse makes about $74,460 on average, while someone in the same position working for the private sector makes about $65,130. A cashier working for the government makes on average $34,470 while a cashier working in a store only makes a mean of $18,880 annually. And a public-relations manager working for the government makes about $132,410 a year compared to $101,220 in the private sector.Lower: Petroleum engineers working for the government earn an average of $93,140; in the private sector, they make an average of $119,140. An editor working for the government only makes $42,210, compared to an average of $57,180 in the private sector.It's worth noting that the BLS's overall average for federal jobs is $68,740 compared to the private sector average of $42,270, so it reflects the Cato Institute findings. That brings us back to Brown's original statement, that federal employees make twice as much ""as their private counterparts."" First, even if you look at the average overall, he's exaggerating the difference. The numbers he cites from the Cato study are not twice as high. Secondly, it's important to understand that a big reason for the disparity is the different mix of jobs in the federal work force. It has more higher-paying white-collar jobs, experts told us, while there are more lower-paying, blue-collar jobs in the private sector that bring the average down. So it is not an apples-to-apples comparison. Finally, we found it's a mixed bag when comparing individual private and public sector occupations -- the ""private counterparts"" he spoke of. Some public jobs pay more, some pay less. And the public ones that pay more are not consistently double as he claimed. So he's wrong to say it's double and wrong to suggest that it's always the case when comparing specific jobs. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2010/feb/03/scott-brown/politifact-debut-brown-says-federal-jobs-pay-twice/

Beck claims Marines were created by Thomas Jefferson to combat Islamic pirates
","On his Fox News program on Jan. 29, 2010, Glenn Beck was providing a history lesson on progressives in U.S. politics when he made the point that the difference between progressives and the Founding Fathers is that the founders thought the United States ""should be Switzerland. We should stay out of everybody's business, be friends with everybody.""

""I mean, if you're going to mess with us, we're going to pound you,"" Beck said. ""Thomas Jefferson created the Marines for the Islamic pirates that were happening, right?"" One of the panelists on the show agreed with him, and Beck continued: ""And so they didn't take any guff. But they weren't spreading democracy. Progressives spread democracy and gooey goodness.""

We wondered, was the U.S. Marines Corps really created by Jefferson to combat the Islamic terrorists of yesteryear?

Our first call was to Charles P. Neimeyer, director of the History Division, U.S. Marine Corps in Quantico, Va.

The Marine Corps annually marks its birthday on Nov. 10, to commemorate the day in 1775 that the Continental Congress formally adopted a resolution founding the Continental Marines, Neimeyer said. During the Revolutionary War, Marines fought with distinction. On March 3, 1776, 200 Marines spearheaded the first American landing on foreign soil, an assault in the Bahamas.

So that's why, if you go the Marine Corps' History Web site, you'll see the banner, ""Since 1775, the Marine Corps has been winning battles and defending our nation.""

Obviously, that predates Thomas Jefferson's presidency.

It also happens to predate the United States of America. After the Revolutionary War, the Navy and Marines disbanded. The country essentially did without a Navy (and Marines) until the Naval Act of 1794, which called for the construction of six frigates, which were to include a force of Marines.

Why was the Navy re-established? A couple reasons.

According to Marine Corps scholars, one of the principal reasons was that Barbary ""corsairs"" were harassing and attacking American ships doing trade at Mediterranean ports. The corsairs were essentially North African pirates, and they were Muslims. The Washington Post wrote an interesting story about some of the historical parallels between then and now. So Beck is correct about that.

But Beck is wrong on one important detail. The Marines weren't created by Jefferson. And as it turned out, the conflict with Barbary pirates wasn't the impetus behind finally getting the Marine Corps established.

A temporary lull in the Barbary conflict delayed implementation of the Naval Act. But in 1797, a new conflict arose on the high seas -- with France. Tensions with France rose during the naval war between France and Britain, with France interfering with a number of American merchant ships. And on July 11, 1798, President John Adams (not Jefferson) signed legislation formally creating the U.S. Marine Corps to help deal with the French. And, in fact, the Marine Corps did participate prominently in the short-lived undeclared ""Quasi-War"" with France. After the fighting with France, the conflict with Barbary pirates flared up again. Under Jefferson, the Marine Corps was employed in numerous operations against the pirates and the north African countries that sponsored them. Famously, Marines led an overland assault and captured the city of Derna in Tripoli in 1805 (hence the line in the Marines' Hymn, ""the shores of Tripoli"").

We think the spirit of Beck's claim is largely accurate, that the threat of Barbary corsairs -- or as Beck accurately calls them, Islamic pirates -- inspired Congress to move toward re-establishing a Marine Corps. It turned out that a conflict with France actually kicked that proposal into gear, and Beck named the wrong president (though he was only off by one administration). And so we give his statement a Half True.",/factchecks/2010/feb/03/glenn-beck/beck-claims-marines-were-created-thomas-jefferson-/

Perry says he cut property taxes by one-third
","Talking about tax cuts can score a candidate big points, and Gov. Rick Perry didn’t let that opportunity sail by during the Jan. 14 GOP gubernatorial debate.When his record on jobs was attacked by both of his challengers, U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and Wharton businesswoman Debra Medina, Perry struck back. ""We cut property taxes by one-third,"" he said.That sounds like a lot. We decided to check the numbers.First, some history. In 2006, the Legislature passed and Perry signed a tax overhaul that was intended to reduce property taxes paid to school districts. To help offset the revenue lost by the districts, lawmakers restructured the state’s business tax and raised the cigarette tax.During the debate, Perry's reference to cutting property taxes left out some key facts.For one, the cut applied only to school taxes, which means that all the other property taxes paid by Texans — including those going to cities and counties — were unaffected. Secondly, the Legislature reduced the tax rate, not Texans' total tax bills, by 33 percent. And thirdly, only one portion of the school property tax rate was affected — the part used for maintenance and operations.True, most of every dollar in school taxes goes for maintenance and operations. According to a 2008 report from the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, a nonprofit business group, that accounted for about half of all property taxes levied in Texas in 2005, the year before the cuts began.But Perry’s shorthand statement that property taxes were cut by a third, which has been repeated by other politicians, is an oversimplification.Overall, school tax collections did decline 6.4 percent between 2005 and 2007, the year the cuts were fully implemented. And the portion collected for school maintenance and operations dropped $2.2 billion, a 12.5 percent decrease, according to the Texas Education Agency. However, most taxpayers focus on the bottom line of their tax bill. That's where we looked, too.We found that the total amount of local property taxes paid by Texans — to all the different taxing entities — actually rose nearly 5 percent from 2005. When all was said and done, taxpayers paid $1.6 billion more in 2007.  We did find some support for Perry's claim in the 2008 report from the TTARA, titled ""Property Tax Relief: The $7 Billion Reality."" The report compared those 2007 property taxes with what it calculated Texans would have paid without a rate cut. The savings amounted to about $7 billion, it said.""The average Texan's total property tax bill in 2007 was 20 percent lower than what it likely would have been had there been no tax relief initiative,"" the report concludes.That still didn't get us to Perry's 33 percent (one-third) claim.Next, we went to the Texas Education Agency. It offered data showing that collections for school maintenance and operations taxes were indeed 30.2 percent lower in 2007 than the state projected they would have been without the tax cut.The problem is, taxpayers don't compare their tax bills to what they might have paid but to what they actually paid last time.Why didn't school taxes fall more between 2005 and 2007? Dale Craymer, president of the TTARA, said there are two major reasons. The first was a provision in the 2006 tax overhaul that gave school boards the option of voting to raise the maintenance and operations rate by a few cents for enrichment purposes. By 2007, more than 1,000 Texas school districts had done so, according to the TTARA report. That lessened the impact of the mandatory 33 percent rate reduction in those districts.Craymer said the second  — and the most powerful — factor was rising property values. If values rise proportionately more than tax rates are cut, savings are negated and tax bills go up. In both 2006 and 2007, the total taxable value of property in Texas rose more than 10 percent each year.The association's report identified other reasons that the overall reduction in property taxes did not meet expectations: increases in the portion of school taxes dedicated to bond debt, as well as increases in taxes paid to cities, counties and other taxing districts.Summing up: In the debate, Perry failed to accurately characterize the tax cut passed in 2006 and its impact on Texans. Total property tax collections rose, not fell. And though it's estimated that Texans did receive significant tax savings compared with what they would have paid without the cuts, those savings were probably closer to 20 percent than 33 percent. We rate Perry's claim as Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/feb/03/rick-perry/perry-says-he-cut-property-taxes-one-third/

Axelrod claims Democrats passed 25 tax cuts last year without the help of Republicans
","With the recent Massachusetts Senate election redefining the political landscape in Washington, NBC's Meet the Press host David Gregory asked David Axelrod, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama, whether the president now needs to start moving more toward the middle.Axelrod responded that Republicans and Democrats ought to be working together on ways to stimulate job growth, but he said Republicans have not gotten on board even when it comes to tax cuts that Republicans have traditionally supported.""We passed without, frankly, the help of the Republican caucus, we passed 25 tax cuts last year, mostly aimed at the middle class and small businesses,"" Axelrod said.We were intrigued by the claim that Democrats passed 25 tax cuts last year, so we contacted the White House press office and asked for a list. And they gave us one, all from the economic stimulus package championed by Obama and signed on Feb. 17, 2009.We checked them out, provided sections and page numbers in the stimulus for reference, and added a brief explainer for some. If your eyes glaze over midway through, feel free to skip ahead to the bottom of the list where we'll pick up our analysis.Individual Tax Cuts:1. ""Making Work Pay"" Tax Credit (Sec. 1001, Page 195). In tax years 2009 and 2010, the Making Work Pay provision will provide a refundable tax credit of 6.2 percent of earned income up to $400 for individuals and up to $800 for married taxpayers filing joint returns. 2. Increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit (Sec. 1002, Page 198). Go to the stimulus bill for all the details, but it essentially expands this benefit for the working poor. 3. Increased Eligibility for the Refundable Portion of Child Credit (Sec. 1003, Page 199). In 2009 and 2010, families who don’t earn enough to pay income tax would be eligible to claim the $1,000 child credit.4. ""American Opportunity"" Education Tax Credit (Sec. 1004, Page 199).

The biggest ticket tax cut was the first one on the list, the Making Work Pay tax cut that is expected to cost the government about $116 billion over two years. Interestingly, the White House did not include the Alternative Minimum Tax patch, which has been extended annually for years. But that accounted for another $70 billion for one year. Together, those two items account for the lion's share of the tax cuts in the stimulus. Which leads us to the question of whether all of these 25 qualify as tax cuts? ""In a way this reminds me of Clinton's 'It depends on what your meaning of is is' comments,"" said Rosanne Altshuler, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ""It depends on what you mean by tax cuts.""""These are all provisions that cut your taxes,"" she said, ""but most of them are temporary,"" designed to stimulate a floundering economy.Each of the tax provisions in the stimulus could have been broken into separate bills, said Bob Williams, also of the Tax Policy Center, and on their own could have rightly been billed as separate tax cuts.""They packed an awful lot into that bill,"" Williams said. ""I think it's fair to say that various tax provisions in the stimulus could be considered tax cuts. I don't think that's being deceptive.""We agree. But there's one other element of Axelrod's claim, that the tax cuts were passed without the help of Republicans.The stimulus passed the House with nary a Republican vote. And it passed the Senate with just three (though we note that one of them, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, is now a Democrat).So it's certainly fair to say the stimulus passed without the help of the Republican caucus.

Medina says 400 children were taken from their parents because of a hoax
","
Republican Debra Medina recently issued a call to action asking fellow Texans to join her in ""the fight for freedom"" that she's dubbed the cornerstone of her campaign for governor.

""Why have we Texans allowed 400 children to be taken from their parents, from a prank call, without warrant?"" her Jan. 27 e-mail states. ""This is NOT FREEDOM.""

Medina didn't respond to several phone calls to elaborate on what she meant.

But it’s all but certain she was referring to the Yearning for Zion Ranch raided by state officials in April 2008, leading to 439 children being placed into foster care for about two months while authorities investigated child abuse suspicions about men living on the ranch outside Eldorado, where a polygamist sect of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints had settled.

By all accounts, a March 30, 2008, telephone call to a West Texas family violence shelter led the shelter to contact state officials who then got a judge’s permission to raid the ranch. The judge also authorized the removal of children from the ranch.

Authorities said then that the crucial initial call came from a 16-year-old girl who told the shelter she’d suffered sexual and physical abuse at the hands of her husband on the ranch.

Texans watching the saga—including the separation of many children from their mothers and siblings—grew uncertain over whether state officials had overstepped their lawful duty to intervene in response to reports of child abuse or neglect.

In May 2008, the Texas Supreme Court ordered all but a handful of the children to be returned to the ranch. The court further ruled that the state went too far by removing every child. It also said the state failed to show that any more than five teenage girls were being sexually abused or that prepubescent children were in danger.

In the following months, however, officials filed criminal charges ranging from bigamy to sexual assault of a child against 12 men connected with the ranch, including sect leader Warren Jeffs, 54.

Last November, Raymond Jessop, 38, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually assaulting an underage girl with whom he had a ""spiritual marriage."" His young wife had become pregnant at age 16.

But the state has ended its day-to-day oversight of the ranch residents; the last girl returned from foster care in August 2009.

And officials never found anyone who admitted to being the girl authorities say called the crisis center. They did determine, however, that the call was made from a phone in an apartment in Colorado Springs, Colo., then home to Rozita Swinton, a woman who has been convicted making another hoax call.

Spokesman Patrick Crimmins of the Texas Department of Family Protective Services, which oversees Child Protective Services, the agency responsible for investigating suspicions of abuse and neglect, conceded that the call from Colorado prompted investigators to seek judicial approval to visit the ranch.

But Crimmins disputed the notion that the call—hoax or not—prompted the removal of children.

""Once caseworkers arrived at the YFZ Ranch,"" Crimmins said, ""the investigation that occurred and the subsequent removal was based on what investigators found — evidence of abuse.""

A December 2008 DFPS report concluded that 12 girls who’d been living on the ranch were victims of sexual abuse. The report said more than 260 children suffered neglect because they were exposed to sexual abuse in their households.

Medina correctly said more than 400 children were taken from their parents. And the detention of the children happened after state authorities were called by the shelter that fielded a call from Colorado that may have been a hoax — though no authority has proved the call was a prank.

Significantly, the removal of children didn’t solely occur because of the call, as Crimmins said.

The children were taken temporarily based on what investigators saw upon the raid. Therefore, Medina's additional claim that the children were removed ""without warrant"" isn't supported.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Mitch McConnell']","
McConnell reverses position on Conrad-Gregg budget commission
","Earlier this year, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was gung-ho behind an amendment intended to improve federal fiscal health. The proposal -- a  ""Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action"" -- was co-sponsored by the top Democrat and the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, Kent Conrad, D-N.D., and Judd Gregg, R-N.H. It would establish an 18-member bipartisan commission to study the current and future fiscal condition of the federal government and make recommendations about how revenues and expenses can be brought into line. Those recommendations would be fast-tracked to the House and Senate floors under a special procedure. In a May 12, 2009, Senate floor session to discuss the Medicare Trustees' Report, McConnell said, ""We must address the issue of entitlement spending now before it is too late. As I have said many times before, the best way to address the crisis is the Conrad-Gregg proposal, which would provide an expedited pathway for fixing these profound long-term challenges. This plan would force us to get debt and spending under control. It deserves support from both sides of the aisle. The administration has expressed a desire to take up entitlement reform, and given the debt that its budget would run up, the need for reform has never been greater. So I urge the administration, once again, to support the Conrad-Gregg proposal. This proposal is our best hope for addressing the out-of-control spending and debt levels that are threatening our nation’s fiscal future."" That's a pretty clear endorsement of a bill, even though McConnell was not a co-sponsor. We tracked down one other occasion when McConnell spoke favorably about the bill. According to an Associated Press account at the time, McConnell also advocated the Conrad-Gregg approach in comments at a Feb. 23, 2009, White House summit on fiscal responsibility. But then, on Jan. 26, 2010, when the Conrad-Gregg bill, originally introduced as S. 2853, came for a vote in the Senate, it fell seven votes shy of the Senate's 60-vote threshold for passage, garnering 53 yeas and 46 nays, with one senator not voting.  The measure would have passed with 60 votes if only seven additional Republicans who had co-sponsored S. 2853 had voted for it. Instead, those seven -- Robert Bennett of Utah, Sam Brownback of Kansas, Mike Crapo of Idaho, John Ensign of Nevada, Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, James Inhofe of Oklahoma and John McCain of Arizona -- withdrew their co-sponsorship in the days before the vote and then voted against it on the floor. But the Senate Republican leader from Kentucky has probably taken the most flak on the issue for voting ""no.""  In a scathing Washington Post op-ed column on Feb. 1, 2010, Fred Hiatt, referring to McConnell's ""no"" vote on the commission, wrote that ""no single vote by any single senator could possibly illustrate everything that is wrong with Washington today. No single vote could embody the full cynicism and cowardice of our political elite at its worst, or explain by itself why problems do not get solved. But here's one that comes close."" Hiatt continued that ""it's impossible to avoid the conclusion that the only thing that changed since May is the political usefulness of the proposal to McConnell's partisan goals. He was happy to claim fiscal responsibility while beating up Obama for fiscal recklessness. But when Obama endorsed the idea, as he did on the Saturday before the vote -- and when the commission actually, against all odds, had the wisp of a chance of winning the needed 60 Senate votes -- McConnell bailed."" Meanwhile, on the same day Hiatt's column was published, the president himself urged McConnell by name to change his mind about the commission, during remarks on his administration's proposed 2011 budget. ""I hope that, despite the fact that it got voted down in the Senate, that both the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, and the Republican leader in the House, John Boehner, go ahead and fully embrace what has been a bipartisan idea to get our arms around this budget."" So did McConnell flip-flop on his position? At the time of the vote, many Republicans were coming under pressure from antitax activists to oppose such a commission. These activists argued that it would have opened the door to tax increases. (Bennett, Hutchison and McCain are under special pressure because they face difficult primaries this fall from challengers on their right.) For their part, many Democrats voted against establishing a commission amid pressure by liberal interest groups that worried that the commission could recommend deep cuts to spending programs. When we asked McConnell's staffers whether they had any explanation for the senator's switch, a spokesman referred us to what McConnell had said in a Jan. 31, 2010, interview with John King, the host of CNN's Sunday-morning show, State of the Union. In that interview, King said to McConnell, ""If this was such a good idea that they would co-sponsor it -- this is what comes up, Sen. McConnell, in my travels all the time. People say, why do they always just play politics in Washington? Is this just politics, as the president says, or if it was the same proposal six months ago when they co-sponsored it, what was wrong with it last week when a Democratic president wanted it?"" McConnell responded by throwing the blame back on the president, who he said was, at best, uninterested in the idea until Senate Democrats -- under pressure to pass a politically unpopular increase to the federal debt limit -- urged him to back the bill as cover. ""Well, what was wrong with it last year?"" McConnell said to King. ""I mean, I discussed this very issue with the president right after he came to office, and with his chief of staff. Never could get a commitment out of him. In the meantime, we've seen a year now in which we've been on a spending binge. They passed a budget that doubled the national debt in five years and tripled it in 10. There's a lot of skepticism now about whether -- and the president endorses this commission a couple of days before the vote [on the debt-limit bill]. Where was he a year ago when we were talking to him about it?"" (We recently fact-checked the point McConnell made about the debt tripling in 10 years and found some caveats.) McConnell also told King that he still favors the commission model, and in fact voted for an alternative amendment that would have established a commission to propose spending cuts. But unlike the Conrad-Gregg commission, the one that McConnell -- as well as the seven former co-sponsors of the Conrad-Gregg commission -- backed would not entertain the possibility of tax increases, something that Conrad and Gregg maintained had to remain on the table. When King asserted that a commission that didn't address tax increases would suit Republicans' political purposes, McConnell responded, ""Look, nobody thinks raising taxes in the middle of a recession is a good idea. Have you ever heard anybody say that? I don't think so. We're in the middle of a recession. We've got 10 percent unemployment. ... Look, I don't think anybody in the country thinks we have a problem because we tax too little. I think the problem is we spend too much. So I like the commission idea, just as I said a few months ago. I think a better way to do it is to target spending, a spending reduction commission."" Independent sources agree that McConnell has a point that Obama was also inconsistent about the merits of Conrad-Gregg commission. Gregg, according to the New York Times, said the president ""may be a little too late to the party"" given the intensity of opposition ""from people who don't want any scent of tax increases."" Still, Obama had never come out as forcefully against the proposal as McConnell had in favor of it prior to switching sides. As we indicated earlier, McConnell was not a co-sponsor of S. 2853. However, he is not only on record praising the measure just eight months earlier but is also on record saying that he had praised it on numerous occasions.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'Barack Obama']","
Health care reform estimates for deficit reduction are not that exact
","President Barack Obama continued to promote Democratic proposals to reform health care during his State of the Union address. He rebutted charges that it costs too much and pointed out that budget experts believe it could reduce the deficit.""It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses,"" Obama said. ""And according to the Congressional Budget Office -– the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress –- our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades.""Obama is correct that the Congressional Budget Office, with its teams of economists and legislative analysts, has found that the Senate Democratic health care plan not only pays for itself but brings down the deficit. That's because the plan includes new tax provisions and cost-savings measures to pay for its spending.The CBO found the Senate Democrats' version of health care reform would reduce the deficit by $132 billion over 10 years. The deficit is expected to go down because tax increases and cost savings in the bill are expected to exceed the cost of the new programs and tax credits. So how does Obama get to $1 trillion over 20 years?The CBO usually only calculates the impact of legislation's cost over 10 years. But it will create calculations for a longer period if Congress requests it.The CBO doesn't like to calculate longer than 10 years because many variables are difficult to predict. Here's what the CBO had to say about calculating health reform's effect on the deficit between 2020 and 2030:""Although CBO does not generally provide cost estimates beyond the 10-year budget projection period (2010 through 2019 currently), Senate rules require some information about the budgetary impact of legislation in subsequent decades, and many Members have requested CBO analyses of the long-term budgetary impact of broad changes in the nation’s health care and health insurance systems. A detailed year-by-year projection for years beyond 2019, like those that CBO prepares for the 10-year budget window, would not be meaningful because the uncertainties involved are simply too great. Among other factors, a wide range of changes could occur — in people’s health, in the sources and extent of their insurance coverage, and in the delivery of medical care (such as advances in medical research, technological developments, and changes in physicians’ practice patterns) — that are likely to be significant but are very difficult to predict, both under current law and under any proposal.""In fact, the CBO won't even present its findings as a straightforward dollar number, but instead as a percentage of the gross domestic product, or GDP, which is a number that measures a nation's economic output. The CBO said that over the second 10 years, the Senate proposal should reduce the deficit by about one-quarter to one-half percent of GDP.Obama's $1 trillion figure is an extrapolation of what one-fourth to one-half of 1 percent of GDP might be. (The White House press office confirmed that this was how he arrived at that number.)According to the CBO's latest numbers, GDP will be $22.5 trillion in 2020. You can do a rough estimate and find that you could get to roughly $1 trillion over 20 years, especially if you lean closer to one-half of 1 percent rather than a quarter.We ran all this by Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Institution. He said that the numbers aren't phony, but that Obama tries to put a hard number on something that is inherently unpredictable.""You really can't model GDP 15 years from now,"" he said. Riedl also said he thought Congress would not be able to stick to some of the spending reductions contained in the Democratic proposals, especially in regards to Medicare. We also asked Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, what he thought of the formulation. Horney said the CBO officials don't give a precise number because they don't have official estimates for the overall economy, called a baseline, for the second 10 years. ""They correctly hesitate to put in precise numbers that might make people think they do have a 20-year baseline,"" he said.As for Obama's $1 trillion number, Horney said, ""It's a little speculative, but if you say in your speech it will reduce the deficit one-quarter to one-half percent of GDP, no one listening to the State of the Union would have a clue as to what you meant, and it would make it sound like a tiny amount when it's not.""So Obama is relying on some very shaky estimates here. He would have been on firmer ground if he had simply said that during the second 20 years, the CBO found that health care would continue to improve the deficit. He gave himself some leeway was by saying it could be ""as much as"" $1 trillion, but that's an estimate that the CBO itself didn't produce. In fact, the CBO said the uncertainties involved are too great to create detailed projections. For putting a firm number on the CBO's carefully hedged projection, we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/feb/01/barack-obama/health-care-reform-estimates-deficit-reduction-are/

Hutchison says Texas state doesn't use E-Verify to weed out undocumented workers applying for jobs
","
U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican candidate for governor, is one of nearly 183,500 employers nationwide who have registered to use E-Verify. The federal electronic system is designed to prevent the hiring of illegal workers by letting employers run a prospective employee's name, date and Social Security number through government records.

During the Jan. 14 GOP gubernatorial debate, she criticized the state for not using the online system to check its job applicants.

""The State of Texas does not even use the E-Verify system to determine if someone is legally in our country when they apply for a job,"" she said. ""If I'm governor of Texas, we will."" 
During the second debate Friday, Hutchison called E-Verify the best system for employers to identify undocumented workers. 
Is Texas state government really not using the verification service singled out by Hutchison? If not, does that mean it isn't checking whether job applicants are legally living here? 
During Friday's debate, Gov. Rick Perry said: ""E-Verify would not make a hill of beans' difference when it comes to what's happening in America today. You secure the border first, then you can talk about how to identify individuals in an immigration situation."" 
Still, the state does screen prospective employees.

Allison Castle, Perry's press secretary, said: ""We use I-9 forms in compliance with federal law."" 
She was referring to the Employment Eligibilty I-9 form from the Department of Homeland Security which must be filled out by the employer and new employees to document that each employee — citizen and non-citizen alike — is authorized to work in the United States. Employers, who are required to keep filled-out forms on file for three years, are subject to penalties if they can't produce them upon request from federal agencies.

Tyler Moran, policy director for the National Immigration Law center, which advocates for low-income immigrants, said the I-9 form, if completed in good faith, is an effective means of weeding out undocumented workers.

Authorities say that by completing the form, employers demonstrate that they have examined relevant documents (such as a Social Security card) to check their workers' identities. That's how the State of Texas has certified new hires' legal residency since 1986, when a federal law prohibited employers from knowingly hiring residents who are not legally living in the United States.

In 2007, Texas enacted legislation that further requires businesses that are applying for a grant or tax cut from a public agency to submit a statement certifying that they don't knowingly employ undocumented residents.

But no law requires employers to verify the authenticity of their workers' documents. Undoubtedly, some undocumented immigrants use fake or stolen Social Security numbers to apply for jobs.

The E-Verify system, which uses information from the I-9 form, was developed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to prevent such fraud. About 183,500 entities use the program, including 9,700 of the roughly 380,600 private Texas employers including AT&T and the Houston Ballet. Except for an estimated 170,000 federal contractors, E-verify is still voluntary for an estimated 6 million employers.

Since its inception in 2006, E-Verify has been used by Hutchison's office to screen 363 job applicants to her Washington and Texas offices, according to DHS spokeswoman Maria Elena Garcia Upson.

But E-Verify isn't foolproof. It has incorrectly identified legal residents as undocumented workers and vice versa.

According to the the Department of Homeland Security, which operates E-Verify with the Social Security Administration, 0.3 percent of workers — from the millions of queries employers have filed — have successfully contested instances when their documents didn't match E-Verify records.

In 2002, Westat, a Washington research organization, evaluated E-Verify's pilot program at the request of the federal government. The group found that there were ""serious problems with the timeliness and accuracy of the INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) database.""

In March 2009, the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan agency that provides analysis to Congress, found that while the program had improved, it was still flawed: ""While... E-Verify can detect certain types of document fraud, it has limited ability to detect such fraud when the 'counterfeit documents are of reasonable quality and contain information about actual work-authorized persons.' Valid documents obtained by using fraudulent birth certificates or other so-called breeder documents may be even more difficult for E-Verify to detect.""

About a month later, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano (who'd earlier signed legislation making E-Verify mandatory in Arizona, where she was governor) touted the program as the best way to verify the legal residency of state government workers, ""adjunct to enforcement of our immigration laws.""

Ten states require their state agencies to participate in E-Verify; three more — South Carolina, Arizona and Mississippi — require all employers to use it, too. In 2008, though, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour aired these misgivings: ""I am concerned about mandating the E-Verify system as the sole source from which an employer in Mississippi can verify a potential employee’s eligibility, especially since the federal government itself has said E-Verify is not a reliable system.""

The bottom line: Texas uses the same method of checking legal residency that most states use. But Hutchison correctly said the state doesn't use E-Verify. We find her statement True.",/factchecks/2010/feb/01/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-texas-state-doesnt-use-e-verify-wee/
"['Abortion', 'Texas', 'Republican Party of Texas']","
The GOP says Bill White allowed a ""gigantic abortion mill"" to be built
","
Jan. 22 marked the 37th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision, which protects a woman's qualified right to terminate her pregnancy.

In honor of the occasion, the Republican Party of Texas linked Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Bill White to what it called a ""gigantic abortion mill"" in Houston.

We saw the claim in an e-mail the party distributed last week: ""In Houston, former mayor and now Democratic contender for governor Bill White has presided over the construction of what may be the world's largest abortion clinic. White bills himself as a moderate Democrat, but his administration allowed this 6-floor, 78,000 square foot facility to be built.""

In its e-mail, the GOP added a dramatic kicker: ""And there's more to this awful story: White's director of Health Policy was one Elena Marks. Ms. Marks is (or was) also the Texas head of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Bill White's connection to this gigantic abortion mill is undeniable; he holds no claim to being a moderate Democrat.""

That's quite an indictment. Is it true?

Katy Bacon, White's campaign spokeswoman, said: ""Bill White had nothing to do with a Planned Parenthood facility.""

Bryan Preston, communications director for the state party, said: ""It happened under his watch, and he had someone working with him in his administration that he appointed that is closely connected to Planned Parenthood.""

What we found: This March, Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas, which opened more than 75 years ago, plans to move from its current location to a building it began refurbishing in 2008 with $17 million in private donations. The seven-story, 78,000-square-foot former Sterling Bank building on Houston's Gulf Freeway will be the biggest Planned Parenthood facility in the United States, according to Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Rochelle Tafolla.

The new facility includes a surgical suite that will provide the same services that the current location has offered since 1973. Currently, the clinic performs about 20 abortions per day. Tafolla said more than 90 percent of the clinic's services relate to preventative care, such as breast exams and cervical cancer screening.

The city issued Planned Parenthood a demolition permit to begin the project in 2008, and several building permits since for various aspects of the construction, Tafolla said.

However, the mayor has no role in approving such permits, said Janice Evans, director of communications for Houston Mayor Annise Parker, White's successor.

Evans said: ""We have thousands of building permits, they do not come to (the) city council.""

Andy Icken, Houston's deputy director of public works, said his department reviewed Planned Parenthood's application for building permits to make sure they complied with the city's building code. Icken also said that nobody from the mayor's office interfered with the application process.

According to the Houston Department of Health and Human Services, facilities seeking to perform abortions apply to the state Department of State Health Services to be licensed in Texas. City officials do not sign off on whether facilities can perform abortions.

What about Elena Marks, White's then-director of health and environmental policy? Did she play a role in getting city approval for the facility?

Marks didn't return our phone calls, though we confirmed separately that Marks served on the board of directors for Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas from 1993-2004.

In 2007, Marks joined the national board of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which doesn't supervise local affiliates but sets general policy for the entire organization, according to Tait Sye, a federation spokesman. Marks previously was the board chair of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the PAC for the national organization.

Contrary to the GOP's claim, Marks was never the Texas head of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America; the position doesn't exist.

Since 2001, Marks has personally donated about $3,500 to Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas. Her latest donation was in March 2007, according to a search of campaign finance records kept by the Texas Ethics Commission.

We found no evidence that Marks used her official position to ensure approval of the building permits.

This much is true: White was mayor when Planned Parenthood started renovating a building to become its new facility.

Using the GOP's logic, White also ""presided"" over Hurricane Katrina and the Houston Astros going to the World Series and countless other coincidental events. But as far as we could tell, White was no more responsible for the Planned Parenthood construction than he controlled the weather, baseball playoffs or other non-mayoral events.

We rate the Texas GOP's claim ridiculously Pants on Fire.

It was like the president was speaking directly to us here at PolitiFact. In this item, we'll examine Hensarling's side of the exchange. Hensarling began by saying that an alternative 2010 budget offered by House Republicans in April would have grown government spending far slower than the Democrats' plan. ""And since that budget was ignored,"" he said, ""what were the old annual deficits under Republicans have now become the monthly deficits under Democrats. The national debt has increased 30 percent."" Hensarling asked if Obama's 2011 budget would ""continue to take us down the path of increasing the cost of government to almost 25 percent of our economy."" Obama said the question sounded more like a talking point from someone running a campaign and was an example of why it's so hard to achieve bipartisan legislation. But was Hensarling right that the old annual deficits under Republicans are now the monthly ones under the Democrats? Only if you do some serious cherry-picking. In a press release issued by Hensarling after the meeting, he noted that the monthly deficit in October 2009 was $176 billion. That's really the first month you can attribute wholly to Democrats -- Obama and the Democrat-controlled Congress. And it's also a high-water mark. The CBO estimates a total 2010 deficit of $1.35 trillion, which works out to an average of about $112 billion per month. So while the deficits fluctuate month-to-month, we think the average is the fairest number when you refer to ""monthly deficits under Democrats."" So to begin with, Hensarling is choosing the highest number.Hensarling compares the October 2009 number to fiscal year 2007 -- the last year in which the nation had a Republican president, George W. Bush, and a Republican-controlled Congress handling the budget -- when the total deficit that year was $162 billion. But that was one of the smaller deficits under Bush. Over his full, eight-year term (including much of the 2009 deficit that rightly falls to him), the country ran up $3.3 trillion in total deficits. That works out to an average of about $412 billion per year -- more than double the number Hensarling is using. If you want to just look at the six years Bush had a Republican Congress, the average drops to about $260 billion a year. Some would argue that to cut out the recession years -- when the deficit exploded -- is unfair (and we agree), but even under that scenario, Hensarling's statistic doesn't hold up if you consider the average monthly deficit under Democrats' full control rather than cherry-picking one particularly high month. ""If he were to say the highest monthly deficit months under Obama versus the lower deficit years under Bush and the Republican Congress, then his numbers are right,"" said Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation. With those kinds of qualifiers, you could argue that the deficit in October 2009 under Obama ($176 billion) was more than the entire 2007 fiscal year under Bush and a Republican Congress ($162 billion). But that's not what Hensarling said. For the sake of argument, let's do some cherry-picking of our own. In October 2008, the month before Obama was even elected, the monthly deficit was $232 billion. That's higher than any of the monthly deficits under Obama. In fact, many of the monthly deficits since the recession began -- and which fall under the watch of Bush and a Democrat-controlled Congress -- have routinely rivaled the monthly deficits under Obama. So using Hensarling's technique, we could also claim that Bush's deficit was higher than Obama's. Hensarling's director of communications, George Rasley, said it was a mistake to look at the numbers as Obama versus Bush. Rather, he said, Hensarling was comparing Democrats to Republicans, not presidents. For the last two years of the Bush administration, he said, Democrats in Congress were ""controlling the purse strings."" But we think dialing back the clock to full Republican control not only leaves Bush entirely off the hook for his role in running up the deficit, it conveniently predates the recession, which has contributed greatly to the deficits. As for Hensarling's claim that the national debt has increased 30 percent, that figure also is misleading. The public debt did increase 30 percent over the fiscal 2009 year. The fiscal year runs from the beginning of October until the end of September. In other words, Obama was inaugurated four months into the fiscal year. The Obama administration's first budget proposal was for the 2010 fiscal year. And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget office estimated the 2009 deficit at nearly $1.2 trillion on the day Obama was sworn in.Obama increased it by about $250 billion, but we think the bulk of the deficit that contributed to the sharp increase in the public debt in 2009 falls to President Bush and the Democratic majority in Congress at the time. We note that under Obama and the Democratic Congress, the debt held by the public is expected to increase another 16.6 percent in the 2010 fiscal year.Hensarling's comparison also ignores the hand Obama was dealt, said Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. While the stimulus has certainly contributed to the deficits in Obama's budgets, he said, they are also largely due to realities in place before Obama took office -- a recession, two wars, unfunded Bush tax cuts and Medicare prescription drug coverage. ""Any year,"" Horney said, ""the deficit is largely the result of everything that goes before it.""In summary, Hensarling's numbers only work if you cherry-pick the highest month under full Democratic control and compare it to one of the lowest years under full Republican control. If you compare average months (about $112 billion a month for Obama and the Democratic Congress) to average years under Bush (about $412 billion a year if you include his full 8-year term, or about $260 billion a year if you only include the first six years with a Republican Congress), Hensarling's numbers are wrong. There are so many bookkeeping tricks in this one that he's far from the truth. We rule his claim False.",/factchecks/2010/jan/30/jeb-hensarling/rep-hensarling-says-annual-deficits-under-republic/

Zaccaria says Langevin voted to spend ""$3 billion for a jet engine no one wants""
","
In a news release arguing that Democratic U.S. Rep. James Langevin is wasting taxpayer money, his Republican challenger, Mark Zaccaria, cites the case of a ""blatantly bogus project"" involving a jet engine proposed for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.

""While countless Rhode Islanders are struggling to put food on their tables and find employment, Representative Jim Langevin has voted for billions in wasteful spending. One particularly appalling boondoggle is $3 billion for a jet engine no one wants. Even Secretary of Defense [Robert] Gates and President Obama oppose this expenditure,"" Zaccaria said in the news release, which carried the headline ""Zaccaria Criticizes Langevin on Billions in Pork-Barrel Spending.""

The engine that Langevin voted for is called the F136. General Electric and Rolls-Royce want to jointly build it for the Pentagon's new multi-purpose jet fighter, which is still being flight-tested by Lockheed. The stealth aircraft is designed to be used by the Air Force, Navy and Marines because it can hover, land on aircraft carriers and take off from conventional airfields.

The problem is, the F-35 already has an engine, called the F135. It's manufactured by Pratt & Whitney, which assembles the engines in Middletown, Conn. Ten engines have already been produced.

General Electric and Rolls-Royce want the government to buy their engine -- which is still in the developmental stage -- as a backup. Gates, who has been trying to trim defense spending, has said the F136 is not necessary and a waste of money.

Supporters of the F136 argue that having a second manufacturer forces defense contractors to compete. In addition, Langevin ""felt strongly that having 95 percent of our fleet rely on one engine was too costly and too risky,"" said the congressman's spokeswoman, Joy Fox, referring to Langevin's support for a second engine.

Zaccaria, a former military aviator, said it's ridiculous to have two different engines for the same jet fighter, with two different specifications, two sets of parts and two repair manuals.

We're not going to assess the wisdom of having an alternative manufacturer for the F-35's engine. That's too subjective.

We decided to focus instead on Zaccaria's assertion that Langevin voted to spend $3 billion for the engine when ""no one"" wants it.

The issue came to a key vote in the House in May as part of a $568-billion defense bill. It called for appropriating $485 million for the controversial engine to continue development. So Zaccaria's $3-billion figure is six times too high.

(The Pentagon has estimated it would cost $2.9 billion to finish developing the engine, a figure GE and Rolls-Royce dispute. The highest figure we could find regarding how much Congress has already earmarked for the program is $1.2 billion.)

Langevin, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, backed the F136 in the May vote, opposing an amendment that would have cut the engine from the defense bill.

But Langevin wasn't alone; 230 other congressmen joined him, including 116 Republicans and 114 Democrats.

One other point. Pork barrel spending, by definition, refers to projects designed to bring money or jobs into a politician's home turf. As far as we could tell, nothing about manufacturing the F136 engine would directly benefit Rhode Island, a point on which Zaccaria and Langevin agree.

We asked Zaccaria why he used that term. ""This is pork barrel in that it has no real redeeming value to the budget of the United States of America,"" he said. ""It's probably pork barrel for somebody.""

It's true that many oppose the F136 engine, including Gates and President Obama. And it's true that Langevin voted to support it.

But Zaccaria went further, inflating the price tag associated with the vote and asserting that ""no one"" wants it, when a majority of House members were in favor of keeping it.

His statement is Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/10/mark-zaccaria/zaccaria-says-langevin-voted-spend-3-billion-jet-e/

Scott Bruun sponsored cap-and-trade legislation two years ago; now he calls it a job killer
","  Three years ago, Rep. Scott Bruun, R-West Linn, was the co-sponsor of a bill that would have installed a statewide cap-and-trade system for Oregon electric utilities. The bill had the two major hallmarks of most cap-and-trade legislation, according to Jon Isaacs, the executive director of the Oregon League of Conservation Voters: It set a limit on emissions and then established a system by which companies could trade credits.

The bill didn’t go anywhere, but a year later, in an ultimately successful effort to pick up the endorsement of the league, Bruun was happy to highlight his effort and pledged to give cap-and-trade another ago in the 2009 session. In fact, on the league’s endorsement questionnaire he listed it as the first of nine environmental issues he planned to highlight if re-elected to the Oregon House.

""Rep. (Ben) Cannon and I were co-sponsors of cap and trade legislation in 2007,"" he wrote. ""I look forward to working hard for this in 2009. I have been studying the issue intensely and am even more convinced of its appropriateness."" That answer alone, Isaacs said, was one of the primary reasons why the league ended up supporting Bruun’s reelection to the Oregon House.

Two years have passed since then, so what is Bruun saying these days -- you know, now that he’s campaigning for national office?

""Cap and trade will cause a major tax increase for everybody in American, and will export millions of United States jobs, and will do nothing to solve the"" problem of global warming, he said in February 2010 at a forum in Salem hosted by The 9/12 Project Salem.

Alee Lockman, Bruun’s spokeswoman, says the congressional candidate wasn’t happy with the national legislation, which was crafted on a largely partisan basis unlike the Oregon legislation. She also noted in an e-mail that Bruun has had a change of heart in terms of the effectiveness of cap and trade. ""Scott has found that the policy is flawed, and ultimately believes that the federal cap-and-trade policy is not effective.""

State Rep. Patrick Rose says GOP challenger Jason Isaac favors sales tax growing to 14.5 percent
","
Democratic state Rep. Patrick Rose of San Marcos, seeking re-election in a district whose voters preferred Republican John McCain for president in 2008, depicted the GOP nominee as a high-tax advocate in a recent TV ad that debuted online Sept. 24.

To creepy music in the background and grainy video of the challenger, Jason Isaac, the ad's narrator says Isaac ""supports higher sales taxes. The tax plan he's peddling means Texans would pay the highest sales taxes in America, up to 14.5 percent. So if Isaac gets his way, you'll pay more for every loaf of bread, every prescription, everything you buy in Texas.""

Another Rose ad revisits the tax-hike warning about Isaac with: ""Hey Jason, you can't be serious.""

Gutsy or whack, is Isaac selling a tax surge?

Rose's campaign consultant, Randy Thompson, shared a transcript of an Aug. 17 interview of Isaac on an Internet radio program titled ""Texas Sons of Liberty Riders."" We verified the transcript after Isaac's campaign consultant, Corbin Casteel, provided a web link to the archived audio.

On the show, Isaac said he favors lowering the 10 percent state cap on annual increases in home appraisals to 3 percent and eventually wiping out property taxes altogether.

Isaac also told the hosts that lost revenue from eliminating property taxes could be recovered from higher sales taxes, saying: ""A lot of people like the consumption-based model and there's a group out there, the Texas Public Policy Foundation, they released a study earlier this year that said if you just eliminated property taxes and you wanted to make a pure consumption (tax) base... sales tax is an easier way to put it.""

Isaac then said: ""You increase the sales tax to 14 and a half percent and you've got a wash. It balances out. You could eliminate all your property taxes but everything you buy, you pay a 14 and a half percent tax.""

We confirmed that in April 2009, the conservative-leaning Austin-based public policy foundation issued a report on wiping out property taxes and replacing that revenue with sales taxes. The study says that if the sales tax is limited to items it now covers, it would need to be raised to about 14.5 percent. If it were expanded to all property sales, the state rate could be 12.5 percent, the study says, and if expanded to cover ""all services taxed by at least one other state,"" the rate could be 9 percent.

A sales tax rate of 14.5 percent would--take a breath-- more than double the current Texas rate of 6.25 percent, on which local jurisdictions may tack on up to 2 percent more. As of January, California's 8.25 percent statewide sales tax was the highest in the country, according to the Washington-based Federation of Tax Administrators.

But there was more to Isaac's interview than talking up a sales tax hike, which he noted could also be counterproductive: ""My thought process is you get above 9 and a half (percent sales tax) and you're gonna start driving people to the black market... they're gonna order everything off of Amazon.com... But I like the consumption-based model.""

In a follow-up e-mail, Rose's consultant, Thompson, said Isaac has failed to tell voters precisely how he'd replace the lost property tax revenue. Thompson shared a transcript from a Sept. 12 forum in which Isaac concedes he doesn't have the answer, aside from using money from the state's so-called rainy day fund. ""But,"" Isaac said, according to the transcript, ""I believe if you start to cut property taxes, your tax base is going to grow"" because more people will be able to afford homes and more people will buy more goods and services, resulting in greater sales-tax revenue."" Isaac reaffirmed that position in an interview with us. He also said that while he favors wiping out property taxes, ""I don't have the answers"" on how to replace the revenue.

Isaac's campaign, responding to Rose's ad, distributed a statement saying Isaac does not support raising the state sales tax rate to 14.5 percent, but believes ""Texans deserve options to create a more sustainable tax model and that we need creative new solutions in this tough economy."" On his campaign website, Isaac states he ""believes that a consumption-based model is one possible solution, but there are limitations.""

So, Isaac wants Texas property taxes to go to zero sometime. He says he's uncertain how to get there, yet he supports the ""consumption"" model, meaning a reliance on sales taxes. And he approvingly referred to a study by a conservative group showing that one way to eliminate property taxes in Texas is to raise the state sales tax to 14.5 percent.

Contrary to Rose's statement, though, there's no sign Isaac is peddling a plan to bump the state sales tax to 14.5 percent--indeed, there's flat-out no plan to peddle. Still, there's a shred of truth to Rose's statement because Isaac has saluted the idea of swapping higher sales taxes for cuts in property taxes.

Sharron Angle attacks Harry Reid over giving sex offenders taxpayer-subsidized Viagra
","
Judging by her newest television ad, Sharron Angle, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate from Nevada, is banking on the idea that even Sin City voters have limits on acceptable behavior. 
In an ad released Oct. 7, 2010, Angle accuses Harry Reid of voting to use taxpayer dollars to pay for Viagra for convicted child molesters and sex offenders. 
The ad begins by attacking Reid on immigration, repeating a charge from one of Angle's earlier ads that Reid voted ""to give illegal aliens special tax breaks and Social Security benefits."" When the initial ad came out, we rated those claims False and Barely True, respectively. 
In this article, we'll focus on the Viagra claim. The narrator says, ""Here's the kicker: Reid actually voted to use taxpayer dollars to pay for Viagra for convicted child molesters and sex offenders. What else could you ever need to know about Harry Reid?"" 
Our friends at PolitiFact Texas analyzed a similar -- but not identical -- claim in June, so we'll rely in part on their reporting. 
The charge stems from the health care law passed by Congress earlier this year. By 2014, states must create exchanges in which individuals can buy insurance from a choice of four plans that must meet minimum standards, although premiums, out-of-pocket costs and benefits may differ. To limit costs for indigent residents, premiums and costs such as deductibles and co-payments will be subsidized for people with incomes between 133 to 400 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2009 ranged from $29,327 to $88,200 for a family of four. For instance, people with incomes at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty level will only be responsible for one-third of their out-of-pocket costs; the federal government will pay the rest. 
Last spring, Sen. Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican opposed to the Democratic-sponsored health care plan, requested a report by the Congressional Research Service -- the nonpartisan research arm of Congress -- that examined the Viagra question. CRS concluded that the law does ""not appear to prohibit... coverage for drugs prescribed to treat [erectile dysfunction] for a non-incarcerated beneficiary who was previously convicted of rape, child molestation or another sex offense."" Nor, the memo states, would those individuals ""appear to be excluded from enrolling in a qualified health plan offered through an American Health Benefit Exchange in their state solely because of that conviction."" 
The number of people potentially affected isn't trivial. According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, about 704,700 sex offenders are registered in the United States, including the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. 
Coburn offered an amendment to the health care bill that would ""reduce the cost of providing federally funded prescription drugs by eliminating fraudulent payments and prohibiting coverage of Viagra for child molesters and rapists and for drugs intended to induce abortion."" 
By the time the Senate took up the amendment on March 24, 2010, the margin for passing the bill was extremely narrow, and the bill's sponsors knew that any changes, no matter how small, could effectively kill the bill. So they fought Coburn's amendment for procedural reasons, hoping to save the bill as a whole and knowing that they would almost certainly be called to account for their ""no"" vote during the 2010 campaign. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., encouraged his colleagues to reject the amendment, arguing, ""This is a serious bill. This is a serious debate. The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of the Senate, the debate and the American people... It is a crass political stunt aimed at making 30-second commercials, not public policy."" 
Ultimately, the amendment failed, 57-42, with Reid among those voting against it. The health care law eventually was signed into law, and Baucus was quite right that it would show up in 30-second commercials. 
So how accurate is Angle's charge? The ad implies that Reid actively wanted to give subsidized Viagra to sex offenders, but that isn't the case. First, what Reid actually did was vote against an amendment that would have stopped using taxpayer dollars for that purpose. Second, Senate Democrats made it clear at the time that they were not voting on the merits of the amendment, but rather to salvage their bigger legislative priority, the health care bill itself. Finally, Reid didn't actively bring up this issue; it was proposed by a senator opposed to the broader health care bill. 
We should also mention that the use of taxpayer dollars for sex-offender Viagra was -- and is -- a hypothetical. While CRS concluded that there was nothing in the current law to stop it from happening, the earliest it could start is in 2014 -- so there's ample time for lawmakers or federal officials to write laws or regulations to stop it before then. 
Finally, whatever taxpayer subsidies for sex offenders may materialize after 2014 would not go to all sex offenders; it would go to the subset of sex offenders who get their health care through the exchanges and who also qualify for subsidies. 
The ad is correct that Reid voted against a prohibition on taxpayer-subsidized Viagra for sex offenders. But the ad leaves out a lot of important context that, if it had been included, would have given a different impression. We rate the ad Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/08/sharron-angle/sharron-angle-attacks-harry-reid-over-giving-sex-o/
"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio counters earmark attacks, says he proposed budgets smaller than Charlie Crist's
","
Yep, Gov. Charlie Crist is still talking about those budget ""earmarks"" Marco Rubio tried to stick in the state budget.

Back when Crist was running for the U.S. Senate as a Republican, he claimed that Rubio, as House speaker, tried to direct $800,000 to a South Florida sports group to place artificial turf on a flag football field where Rubio played. PolitiFact Florida ruled the claim Half True, noting that Rubio didn't sponsor the specific appropriation, but supported it by voting for the budget.

Then on Sept. 20, 2010, the new no-party Crist began airing a TV ad criticizing Rubio for inserting $800,000 for a turf field and $1.5 million for a rowing institute. We found even less evidence -- in fact we found none -- that Rubio had anything to do with the rowing institute appropriation and ruled the claim Pants on Fire!

On Oct. 6, 2010, during the first prime-time debate between Crist, Rubio and Democrat Kendrick Meek, Crist again brought up the earmark issue. Midway through the debate, which was moderated by George Stephanopoulos and broadcast on ABC stations across the state, a panelist asked Crist whether he thought his opponents deserved to be on a national corrupt candidates list.

Crist said that he wouldn't say whether Rubio was corrupt (""That's for other people to decide."") But Crist said Rubio put questionable things in the budget, like ""$800,000 for an AstroTurf field on -- for a flag football field that he plays on-- in Miami.""

""Is that corrupt? Is it wrong? It's clearly wrong, in my view. That's why I had to veto some things,"" Crist said.

Rubio was prepared for the attack.

""First of all, let's set the record straight. The things he's absolutely said are just not true,"" Rubio said. ""I had nothing to do with the flag football field.

""The second thing is that he says I steered money -- all these things are false allegations. The fact is that the years that I was speaker, the Florida House consistently offered leaner budgets than the governor offered. Leaner budgets than the Senate offered. If you-- if you wanted a leaner budget, you should have lined up behind our budget. Our budget was even leaner than yours.""

Crist never responded to Rubio's claim about the budget, but the claim had us wondering: Despite all this tough talk by Crist about earmarks and vetoing pet projects, did Rubio actually propose smaller state budgets than the governor?

A quick bit of background. The governor each year proposes a budget to legislators prior to the spring legislative session. But it's the House and Senate that actually craft the state budget plan. Usually, the House and Senate pass different versions of the budget, then work together to reconcile those differences. After a final budget is approved by the Legislature, it is sent on to the governor, who has the power of a line-item veto -- meaning the governor can veto specific appropriations and programs from the budget without having to veto the budget in its entirety.

The state Constitution requires that the state budget be balanced.

Crist was elected governor in 2006, and has presented budgets in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. Rubio served as House speaker during Crist's first two budget years, in 2007 and 2008, so those are the two years we will be comparing.

2007 -- Crist's first budget as governor, Rubio's first as speaker

On Feb. 5, 2007, Crist proposed a $71.2 billion state budget that included $20 million for stem cell research, $32.5 million to establish a voter paper trail and $50 million for ethanol research and manufacturing. But the proposal was short-lived. Souring economic and tax collection data forced Crist to amend his budget recommendations a little more than a month later. Crist revised his budget request on March 15, cutting approximately $473 million in spending. The new proposed spending plan totaled $70.8 billion. (For consistency, we have rounded the overall budget numbers to one decimal place).

The House leadership, led by Rubio as speaker and Ray Sansom as budget council chair, released a $70.2 billion budget program less than two weeks later. The budget that actually passed on April 11 was a little bigger, totaling $70.3 billion. That's about $500 million or .7 percent less than what Crist proposed.

In negotiations with the Senate, the state budget grew. On April 30, Senate and House leaders settled on a $71.9 billion spending plan. Crist wound up vetoing more than $400 million in projects from the Legislature's budget, including $800,000 for artificial turf for a South Florida football field. (The budget ended up being cut by nearly $1.2 billion during a special session because of declining tax revenues, and another $500 million during the 2008 regular session).

To us, the key to the 2007 comparison of the Crist and Rubio-led budget proposals is looking at the revised recommendation of Crist (about $70.8 billion) and the version that Rubio ultimately shepherded through the House (about $70.3 billion). We think it's fair to use the $70.3 billion figure because Rubio controlled a Republican-dominated House and could easily have decided to stick with the lower $70.2 billion original proposal if he wanted.

Conversely, we don't think it's fair to saddle Rubio with the budget that came out of negotiations with the Senate. Nor do we think it's appropriate to consider Crist's original proposal, which came when economic conditions were different and a month and a half before Rubio unveiled his spending plan. Using those two numbers then, $70.3 billion for Rubio and $70.8 billion for Crist, Rubio indeed proposed spending less than Crist. But not by much.

2008 -- Crist's second budget as governor, Rubio's last as speaker

On Jan. 31, 2008, Crist proposed a $70 billion budget, a small decrease from the budget approved in 2007.

""As a nation, we are facing extraordinary economic times,"" Crist said in announcing his budget recommendations. ""However, we can be certain that Florida's brightest days are ahead of us. It is especially important — now more than ever — for government to spend the people's money wisely and live within our means, just as Florida's families do every day.""

Crist's proposed budget added about $1 billion for education, and dipped into trust funds and reserves for about $1.1 billion in order to balance the budget. Crist's budget included a 2 percent pay raise for state workers, allocated $300 million to an environmental land buying program called Florida Forever and sent $46.9 million to expand public health centers.

His ideas got an icy reception from leaders in the House, particularly Rubio, who argued against using reserves to plug budget holes and instead advocated eliminating and merging functions of some state agencies.

""We must balance our budget by living within our means,"" he said. ""We should not spend money that we do not have. And we should not rely on gimmicks.""

As the calendar turned from January to February and then to March, Crist's budget became less and less realistic, as state revenue projections continued to plummet. By March 12, 2008, the Orlando Sentinel reported that the state would receive $3 billion less in revenue than was anticipated when Crist proposed his budget.

Crist said the grim numbers helped advance his position to use one-time reserves to balance the budget without raising taxes.

And Rubio persisted that the government needed to cut spending.

That takes us to March 31, the day the House unveiled its budget proposal. The House advocated for a $65.1 billion budget, which would cut 7.5 percent from the current budget.

The House proposal cut per-student funding $86, eliminated about 1,000 state jobs, and stripped money out of the Florida Forever program. A $65 billion budget plan eventually passed the House along party lines on April 10.

The House and Senate eventually agreed to send a $66.2 billion budget to Crist. Crist ultimately vetoed only $1 million in projects -- $300,000 for a lake restoration program in Central Florida and $840,000 for a Miami festival promoting ties with Miami's sizable Nicaraguan community.

The differences between the House and Crist's proposed budgets in 2008 are more stark than they were in 2007. Crist proposed a larger budget of around $70 billion by tapping trust funds. The House budget was leaner by $5 billion (or more than 7 percent), and relied less on trust funds and more on spending cuts. We should note that Rubio and the House did have the advantage of being able to wait two months after Crist to release their budget proposal. In those two months, revenue projections plummeted, necessitating smaller budgets.

Our ruling

All this budget talk started with an argument over earmarks in the budget, and more generally, who can stake a claim to being the better fiscal conservative -- Charlie Crist or Marco Rubio.

Rubio says the House budgets he proposed in 2007 and 2008 were ""leaner budgets than the governor offered.""

Rubio is largely right, though his claim could use a little additional information. In 2007, the budgets offered by Rubio and Crist ultimately were pretty similar, with the difference being just about $500 million in a budget totaling more than $70 billion. The budgets in 2008 were significantly different, however, primarily because Crist wanted to use trust funds to help balance a bigger budget. Rubio advocated cutting state spending to make the budget smaller. It's also worth noting that state revenue projects took a turn for the worse in between when Crist proposed his budget in 2008, and when Rubio and the House proposed theirs.

Now, in a television ad in the Kentucky Senate race, Democrat Jack Conway is turning the tables, attacking Republican Rand Paul over Medicare deductibles.

Here's the transcript of the ad, released Sept. 28, 2010:

Narrator: ""More from Rand Paul.""

Footage of Rand Paul: ""The real answer to Medicare would be a $2,000 deductible.""

Man: ""A $2,000 deductible?""

Man: ""Rand Paul wants us to pay $2,000 just to get Medicare?""

Woman: ""That's crazy.""

Woman: ""I can't afford that.""

Footage of Rand Paul: ""The real answer to Medicare would be a $2,000 deductible.""

Man: ""I don't know what planet he's from.""

Woman: ""Rand Paul is off the wall with the $2,000 deductible.""

Man: ""He knows we can't afford that.""

Woman: ""The more we hear about Rand Paul, the worse it gets.""

Conway: ""I'm Jack Conway, and I approved this message.""

The grainy footage of Paul is real. It comes from a talk that Paul, an ophthalmologist and longtime libertarian, gave to the Center-Right Coalition, a conservative group, in Lexington, Ky., on June 19, 2009. A longer excerpt from Paul's talk has been posted on YouTube.

To see whether Conway's ad takes Paul's remarks out of context, we transcribed the portion of his speech in which he talks about Medicare.

""What's the problem in medicine?"" Paul began. ""No price fluctuation. If you're over 65 and go to a doctor in this country, you pay the exact same price with every doctor in the whole country. So when they want to blame ... that on capitalism, we have to be smart enough and say, 'We don't have capitalism. We already have socialism.'""

He continued, ""Medicare is socialized medicine. People are afraid of that because, 'Oh, you'll say you're against Medicare.' No, I say we have to do something different. We can't just eliminate Medicare. But we have to figure out how to get more to a market-based system. It's counter-intuitive to a lot of people, but you have to pay for things if you want prices to come down. So you really need higher deductibles. And the real answer to Medicare would be a $2,000 deductible, but try selling that one in an election. But that's the real answer is, you have to pay for things. And when you do, but you also get rid of price controls. So you raise the deductible, you get rid of price controls, and you allow more competition. And you may have to allow more competition from other parties. Nurse practitioners, we already have some. Pharmacists. There have to be ways to allow medicine to come down.""

His comment was no one-time slip of the tongue. The Conway campaign released another ad with footage of at least five other occasions in which Paul spoke publicly about his preference for high deductibles for Medicare, sometimes even invoking the same $2,000 figure.

Indeed, Paul has been caught on camera being open about the political hazards of making such a proposal. In the Lexington talk featured in the first ad, Paul immediately followed his mention of the $2,000 figure with the addendum, ""but try selling that one in an election."" And in the follow-up ad, a clip shows him acknowledging the political risk with striking frankness. ""The hard part,"" he said, ""is how do you present this on national TV? I mean, what's going to happen to me in a statewide race if I tell people I think the Medicare deductible is going to be higher? Am I going to be booted out of the room? I don't know. I'm willing to take a risk because I think it's the right thing to do, and because the other answer is to become just like Canada.""

We did not receive a response from the Paul campaign for this article, but the campaign has responded through TV ads. On Oct. 7, the liberal website Talking Points Memo published a side-by-side comparison of the Paul campaign's two response ads and found subtle but noteworthy differences. In the first, the Paul campaign says that Paul ""never supported higher Medicare deductibles."" In the second, the ad was changed to say that Paul ""doesn't support higher Medicare deductibles."" Had they stuck with the first ad, it would have been undermined by a half-dozen film clips.

Paul refined his policy toward Medicare during an appearance on Fox News on Oct. 6. Paul said that he did not want to impose deductibles on current Medicare beneficiaries but rather on future beneficiaries, possibly starting with those who are currently 55 or younger.

So even Paul now acknowledges that he thinks Medicare deductibles are worth considering. But does Conway's ad fairly portray the views Paul had espoused at the time? They come close, but we do offer one caveat.

We think that the general impression Conway's ad gives -- and in particular the line where the man says, ""Rand Paul wants us to pay $2,000 just to get Medicare?"" -- is that what Paul wants to do is slap seniors with a $2,000 deductible, even though his plan is much more comprehensive. Paul's ideas for Medicare may be good or bad, but the ad is somewhat misleading when it reduces them to a simple $2,000 deductible. That said, we see it as a relatively minor exaggeration. Paul has advocated for a $2,000 deductible in multiple settings, and on balance we rate the ad Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/08/jack-conway/jack-conway-says-rand-paul-backs-2000-deductible-m/

Spanish language ad claims Sen. Barbara Boxer voted against immigration reform
","
A new Spanish language ad from the Susan B. Anthony List, a Republican group that opposes abortion, and the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes gay marriage, attacks Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., on its core issues, saying that Boxer ""doesn’t share our values"" because she ""supports abortion and homosexual marriage.""

The ad, running on Spanish language TV in several large California markets, also attacks Boxer on immigration, saying she ""voted against immigration reform to permit our people to come here legally to work.""

It's a surprising attack, given that Boxer is a well-known advocate for comprehensive immigration reform. Boxer has long favored tougher border security, but she has also advocated a path to citizenship for the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants currently in the United States.

Asked for backup for the ad's claim about Boxer, a spokesman for SBA List pointed us toward a May 23, 2007, story in the New York Times that notes Boxer's opposition to a ""guest worker"" provision proposed for the comprehensive immigration reform initiative that year.

According to the story, ""Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, denounced the guest worker program, saying it would create a pool of 'desperate low-wage workers' whom employers could easily exploit.""

The guest worker program proposed in the 2007 immigration bill was part of the negotiated ""grand bargain"" that sought to get bipartisan support for the bill. The program would have allowed temporary visas for several hundred thousand immigrants to fill unskilled jobs. The visas could be renewed twice, so long as the guest worker returned to his home country for at least a year between visits. And to return, the worker would need sponsorship from an employer.

Many immigration advocates feared it would create an environment where employers could abuse guest workers, because they could control whether that guest worker could return. And Boxer voted to eliminate it. 

A May 29, 2007, editorial in the New York Times described the guest worker provision in the bill as ""an absurd employment hokey-pokey — you put your two years in, then one year out, then repeat that twice and go home forever. It would be massive indentured servitude — colonial times all over again, but without any hope of citizenship for those taking our most difficult and despised jobs.""

The ad doesn't explain any of this background. It merely says Boxer ""voted against immigration reform to permit our people to come here legally to work.""

In fact, Boxer has long been a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform. In 2006, she voted for an immigration reform package that included a more immigrant-friendly temporary guest worker provision. In addition, while she voted against the version of the guest worker provision included in the 2007 immigration reform bill, she ultimately voted to continue debating the bill, although it subsequently died.

Boxer's campaign also notes that she co-sponsored the AgJobs Act of 2009, to allow illegal immigrants who work in the fields to get temporary visas, and eventually a path to permanent residency. And in April 2010, Boxer and 15 other senators sent a letter to President Barack Obama expressing support for a bipartisan immigration reform bill this year.

Marc Rosenblum, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said, ""The ad suggests she has been an anti-immigration vote in Congress and that's not accurate. She voted against that piece of it.""

Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonpartisan research group that supports lower levels of immigration, said the ad ""is clearly intended to convey that she’s against what advocates call 'comprehensive immigration reform' when, in fact, she’s all for the left-wing version of it ... What she voted against was the third leg of 'comprehensive immigration reform,' which is insisted on by the business and libertarian right, which is the increased importation of captive labor via guestworker programs.""

The immigration attack on Boxer doesn't come completely from left field. Trailing badly in polls among California's Latino voters, Republican Carly Fiorina -- who has backed Arizona's controversial immigration law -- has used similar criticisms of Boxer in an attempt to weaken the Democrat with Latino voters.

According to an Oct. 6, 2010, story in the Los Angeles Times, ""though Fiorina has revealed little about how she would approach immigration issues, she has sharply criticized Boxer for seeking to strip a proposed temporary worker program from federal immigration legislation in 2007 that ultimately collapsed in the Senate.""

We think the ad's claim about Boxer's record on immigration is highly misleading. It states simply that Boxer ""voted against immigration reform to permit our people to come here legally to work."" Boxer did not vote against the immigration reform bill in 2007. She voted against a provision in it that she felt would lead to the exploitation of immigrant workers. Moreover, the ad ignores Boxer's history of support for comprehensive immigration reform, including a program to allow immigrants to come to the United States to work legally. We rate the ad's claim about Boxer's immigration record False.",/factchecks/2010/oct/08/susan-b-anthony-list/spanish-language-ad-claims-sen-barbara-boxer-voted/

Ron Johnson says Sen. Russ Feingold cut Medicare by $523 billion
","
In his campaign against U.S. Sen Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin, Republican Ron Johnson has made health reform the centerpiece of his campaign -- slamming Feingold’s support for ""ObamaCare"" in speeches, news releases and TV and radio ads.

Johnson says he wants the whole law repealed.

In a direct mail piece to voters, Johnson criticizes Feingold as being the decisive vote for cuts to Medicare, an especially hot-button topic for senior citizens. Republicans have been using the approach across the country against Democratic incumbents -- just as Democrats have tried to tag Republican candidates as out to gut Social Security.

The eye-catching cover of Johnson’s mailer pictures three whispering women, all seniors, with the tagline: ""Do you know Russ Feingold’s dirty little secret..."" On the flip side, one headline reads ""Ron Johnson will fight to preserve your benefits.""

The other, in a tarnished brown: ""Russ Feingold cut Medicare by $523 billion.""

It goes on to say: ""Feingold cast the deciding vote on ObamaCare, which made cuts to Medicare that will impact 100,000 Wisconsin seniors utilizing the Medicare Advantage program.""

It cites the Christmas Eve 2009 vote in which Feingold joined the 60-vote majority, all Democrats, to move along the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The final vote, in March of 2010, was 56-43. Feingold voted also yes on the final bill.

So does the law ""cut"" more than $500 billion from Medicare?

The national PolitiFact site, and various state sites, have ruled repeatedly on the Medicare question. They have found the health care law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget, but rather is an attempt over 10 years to slow the program’s future growth by curtailing spending by that amount.

Medicare spending will still increase -- the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009.

There are no cuts to guaranteed Medicare benefits.

In fact, there is an expansion of some benefits, such as the gradual closure of the ""doughnut hole"" in the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program. The law also tries to improve the program for beneficiaries by paying more for preventive care.

How do other groups view this question?

The leading senior advocacy group, AARP, took the position that the health care measure was on balance a good thing.

""The health care law strengthens Medicare by protecting and improving your guaranteed benefits and cracking down on waste, fraud and inefficiency,"" a statement on the organization’s website says. ""It also identifies savings that will keep Medicare financially stable for 12 years longer than if the law hadn't been passed.""

But America’s Health Insurance Plans, an insurance industry trade group, has raised concerns about the impact of the changes on benefits, which will vary by insurer.

Under the measure, the second-biggest savings category is Medicare Advantage ($136 billion), making up about one-quarter of the $523 million in ""cuts"" referred to in the mailer. About 25 percent of people covered by Medicare have chosen Medicare Advantage.

Medicare Advantage, often called Medicare's HMO, is an optional program in which the federal government pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare recipients. As PolitiFact National has noted, the Advantage program was conceived as a cost-containment measure on the theory that competition among private plans would drive down costs. That has not happened, and Medicare Advantage actually costs the government more.

President Barack Obama and groups such as AARP have said it's time to bring the costs of Medicare Advantage in line with the cost of regular Medicare.

Advantage beneficiaries would see fewer benefits -- not in the basic package of guaranteed benefits, but in extras that Medicare Advantage offers its patients, such as gym memberships. Some plans pay the patient’s monthly Medicare premium, which can amount to about $100.

Aside from the Advantage reductions, other savings as part of the $500 billion will come from higher insurance premiums for seniors making $85,000 or $170,000 per couple, a new panel to oversee reimbursement rates, and smaller-than-expected increases in payment rates to hospitals and other service providers each year.

Johnson cites two media accounts to back his claim on the $500 billion.

One, a March 2010  Washington Post story, noted a ""total reduction in projected spending on the (Medicare) program to more than $500 billion over the next decade."" That story is highlighted prominently in a related Johnson TV ad. Johnson campaign spokeswoman Sara Sendek also pointed to a CBS News web report, also in March 2010, that references ""$500 billion in Medicare cuts over the next decade.""

Both clearly note the amount is spread over 10 years, with the Post story labeling it ""a reduction in projected spending"" -- elements Johnson did not include in his flier or the TV ad, where the same cut is mentioned.

A final issue is whether Feingold ""cast the deciding vote"" on the new law.

In December 2009, the bill needed 60 votes to prevent Republicans from thwarting passage. But any of the 59 others who voted yes could also be labeled the decisive vote. In any case, Feingold was not a last-minute convert to the bill. His support was not in question.

So, let’s review the Johnson claim.

In a campaign mailer and other venues, Ron Johnson says Feingold supported a measure that cut more than $500 billion from Medicare. That makes it sound like money out of the Medicare budget today, when Medicare spending will actually increase over the next 10 years. What Johnson labels a cut is an attempt to slow the projected increase in spending by $500 billion. Under the plan, guaranteed benefits are not cut. In fact, some benefits are increased. Johnson can say Feingold was the deciding vote -- but so could 59 other people running against incumbents now or in the future.

"['Georgia', 'Campaign Finance', 'Jill Chambers']","
Candidate for state House said her rival took money intended for schoolchildren
","
Even among this election season's accusations of corruption and dastardly deeds, an attack in a local state House race stands out.

A recorded telephone message recently told voters that Democrat Elena Parent is taking money intended for schoolchildren to finance her campaign. 

Taking money from schoolchildren? We had to check this one out.

The race for state House District 81 is one of the most heated and closely contested legislative contests in Georgia this year.

Republican Jill Chambers, a feisty iconoclast, is trying to keep her seat against Parent, a former litigator who worked for a Democratic state senator who became the ambassador to Singapore.

Chambers has served in the House since 2003 and is best known for her work on MARTA's oversight committee, known as MARTOC.

Neither party dominates the district, which runs along Buford Highway in DeKalb County northeast of Atlanta. Democrats think the seat is up for grabs. The outspoken Chambers thinks she is on her way to re-election. 

The campaign is ugly. Parent lobbed attacks accusing Chambers of wastefully spending taxpayer money. Parent's campaign has also launched websites dedicated to attacking the incumbent.

Last week, Chambers blitzed voters with three automated telephone messages, or robocalls, and a mailer accusing Parent of taking money intended for schoolchildren:

""This is an important voter alert for PTA members in DeKalb County,"" a voice on one of the robocalls said. ""Candidate Elena Parent has taken over $22,000 intended for our schoolchildren in campaign contributions from a law firm representing the corrupt DeKalb school board.

""DeKalb County can no longer afford to have politicians like Crawford Lewis, the indicted former school superintendent, and Elena Parent jeopardize our school system’s future. Since these contributions became public last week, Elena Parent has repeatedly refused to return the money. Please call Elena Parent today and tell her to return these contributions.""

The mailer asks, ""Hey, Elena Parent, what did you promise in return for $22,585.09 in contributions from the law firm for the corrupt DeKalb County Board?"" 

It is true that corruption accusations are rocking DeKalb schools. In May, Lewis, former chief operating officer Patricia Reid, Reid's former husband and Reid's secretary were indicted on accusations that Reid ran a criminal enterprise that steered millions of dollars in contracts to the ex-husband, an architect.

The attack's logic is that the school system's legal fees skyrocketed from its budget of roughly $900,000 to $5 million, Chambers said. That means money that should be going to student education is filling the coffers of Sutherland Asbill & Brennan, the law firm to which the attack ads refer.

Sutherland's employees are therefore giving political donations with money intended for children, the line of reasoning goes.

Is this accurate?

We looked at Parent's campaign contribution disclosure reports, which she filed with the State Ethics Commission of Georgia.

The campaign donation figures are correct. From mid-2009 through July, Parent received exactly $22,585.09 in cash and in-kind donations from people who listed their employer as Sutherland, where Parent used to work.

Chambers' attack mailer has other correct information. 

Sutherland does have a contract to provide legal services for DeKalb County schools, including in the Reid matter. The school system does not have its own in-house legal department.

Records show DeKalb arranged to pay Sutherland $120,555 a month for its services, as Chambers' mailer said. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that DeKalb schools spent $5.79 million on lawyers from July 1, 2009, to June 30, 2010, when the district had budgeted $934,816 for legal expenses.

But those contributions to Parent's campaign don't come directly from Sutherland, as the robocall suggests. Its employees made individual donations with their own money.

Chambers acknowledges this, and two of her other ads say the donations are from lawyers, not the firm.  

There are other problems with Chambers' claims.

None of the school system's board members was named in the indictment. A schools spokesman said it is therefore inaccurate to call the board ""corrupt.""

And saying campaign contributions to Parent came from money intended for schoolchildren tests the bounds of logic.

Using Chambers' reasoning, if a Sutherland lawyer bought a candy bar at a Wal-Mart, you could accuse the retailer of taking money intended for schoolchildren.

So while Chambers' attack mailer contains some correct information, the robocall accusation against Parent is incorrect and borders on the ridiculous.

It's unfair to call the DeKalb school board corrupt. School employees, not board members, were indicted. And no one has been convicted.

The contributions were not directly from Sutherland, as the call implied, and were not intended for children. They were from individual contributors who used their personal funds.

This House race is smoking. We give Chambers a Pants On Fire for this one.  ",/factchecks/2010/oct/08/jill-chambers/candidate-state-house-said-her-rival-took-money-in/

NRCC ad bills Rep. John Boccieri's voting record as proof he's Nancy Pelosi's puppet
","
Turning House Speaker Nancy Pelosi into an electoral boogeyman is all the rage this year among Republicans trying to gain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Republicans have spent much of 2010 portraying Rep. John Boccieri as Pelosi’s clone. The GOP candidate for Boccieri’s seat, Jim Renacci, has repeatedy stated that Boccieri votes with Pelosi  94 percent of the time.

The National Republican Congressional Committee label’s Boccieri as one of ""Pelosi’s Puppets"" on its website. It attacks his voting record in a television ad it began airing this week.

""In fact, 93 percent of the time, Boccieri voted with Nancy Pelosi,"" the ad claims. ""Nancy Pelosi can count on John Boccieri,"" concludes the ad, which pictures of both legislators. ""What about us?""

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look.

The NRCC cites a Washington Post voting database to back up its contention.

But Boccieri dismisses claims that he frequently votes with Pelosi as dishonest because House speakers seldom vote. The Washington Post voting database shows Pelosi has voted a mere 94 times in the past two years, while Boccieri has cast 1,550 votes.

""That is just a tradition for Speakers -- they often don't vote,"" says Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly. "" She votes on some bills, not all.""

The Washington Post says its database represents ""the percentage of votes on which a lawmaker agrees with the position taken by a majority of his or her party members,"" rather than the frequency with which they vote with a particular party leader. It says Boccieri voted with his party 94 percent of the time over the past two years. The average party loyalty for all members is listed at 90.6 percent.

Why does the NRCC claim the the Washington Post database represents how often Boccieri votes with Pelosi rather than how often he backs the Democratic majority?  NRCC spokesman Tory Mazzola thinks there’s no difference because Pelosi is the party leader.

""Speaker Pelosi is the leader of John Boccieri’s party, and this non-partisan, independent database confirms that he votes with Speaker Pelosi and her Democratic party at almost every turn."" said an email from Mazzola.

The difference between the 94 percent statistic in the database and the 93 percent number in the ad may be because the Washington Post regularly updates  the database, and extra votes were cast since the NRCC extracted its information. We don’t think it’s worth arguing over such a small difference.

But how much would the statistic change if Boccieri’s votes were measured against the 94 votes that Pelosi actually cast? Did he vote with her 93 percent of the time? We decided to do the math.

We exclude three quorum calls from our calculations because they’re noncontroversial votes where everyone says they’re ""present."" With those out of the picture, Boccieri voted with Pelosi in 77 out of 91 votes, an agreement ratio of 84.6 percent, which makes the Democrat from Alliance look somewhat more independent than Republicans maintain.

And Boccieri differed from Pelosi on some key votes:
  
  
  
  

There still is a kernel of truth here. The NRCC’s underlying point is that Boccieri votes with the majority a lot. But the NRCC’s accuracy suffers because it chose to try to tie Boccieri to a politican it deems unpopular, rather than say what the Washington Post’s database shows.

And when you look at how the House speaker’s votes match up with Boccieri’s, his support hasn’t been as lockstep as the Republicans claim. We rate the NRCC’s claim as Barely True.

Liberal website says Rep. Jim Weidner tried to take health care away from 80,000 Oregon children
","
Forget taking candy away from children. Blue Oregon, a liberal political website, is accusing one Republican candidate of trying to take health care away from 80,000 of Oregon’s youth.

In a postlooking for political contributions, Kari Chisholm of Blue Oregon describes the race in House District 24 as follows: ""Susan Sokol Blosser (the Democrat) is one of the founders of Oregon's world-renowned wine industry where she’s a leader on environmental sustainability. Her opponent, Rep. Jim Weidnerproposed a bill taking away health care for 80,000 of Oregon's children.""

Ouch. Not exactly the sort of thing that wins you votes.

Naturally, PolitiFact Oregon wondered if Weidner, who has four kids himself, really has it out for Oregon’s children.

The claim on Blue Oregon was in reference to House Bill 3603, a bill that Weidner sponsored during the February 2010 special session. The bill, according to the summary, ""repeals (the) health insurance premium assessment.""

That was nice and vague, so we did some more sleuthing and ended up with the staff measure summary for House Bill 2116. Why House Bill 2116? Well, that was the bill that, in part, instituted the ""health insurance premium assessment"" or, to put it comprehensible English, a 1 percent tax on health insurance premiums paid by the insurance companies but passed on to the customers.

According to the staff measure summary, that 1 percent tax would be used to provide funding for health care for 80,000 children during the 2009-2011 biennium through Oregon Healthy Kids. Those 80,000 were in addition to the the children already covered by the state-run plan.

So, it seems, Weidner does want to eliminate a tax that is being used to provide health care to children. We checked in with Weidner to see if he could explain his position. As it turns out, he’s not so much against health care for children as he is against the 1 percent tax. He says the tax disproportionately hurts small businesses. Weidner sponsored the bill, he says, because he wanted to bring attention to this and other issues. ""I knew the bill wasn’t going to go anywhere.""

Before we settled on a ruling we wanted to check one other thing: Even if Weidner’s bill had gone through, are there really 80,000 children who would lose health insurance? We called Oregon Healthy Kids to find out.

As it happens, since the bill passed, about 57,000 children have been enrolled in the program, according to Cathy Kaufmann, manager of the Healthy Kids Office. That’s as of August. Kaufmann expects that the full 80,000 will be enrolled before the end of the 2009-2011 biennium.

So where does that leave us? Well, while we’re feeling pretty confident that Weidner isn’t anti-health care for kids, he did, as the website alleges, propose a bill that would have eliminated the funding for health care for 80,000 children. Whether he thought it would pass or not doesn’t much change things. And some context about how he was really targeting a tax would have been nice.  Still, we rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/08/blue-oregon/liberal-website-says-rep-jim-weidner-tried-take-he/

U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett says he voted against the bank bailout
","
In a TV ad that started airing Oct. 4, small-business owners applaud U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, who boasts about his vote against the bank bailout package that has haunted some incumbents seeking re-election. When the U.S. House passed the legislation Oct. 3, 2008, most Democrats voted for it while a majority of Republicans said no. 
In the ad, Doggett says: ""I said no to these big bank bailouts. We need to focus our resources on helping Central Texas, not Wall Street."" 
We ran his claim through the Truth-O-Meter after a reader urged us to check it out. 
First, the big picture: In 2008, after a housing boom, the bubble burst when securities backed by risky mortgages contaminated the greater financial system. The markets tanked and the government scrambled to pick up the pieces. 
In September of that year, the government seized control of mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which had funded more than two-thirds of recent home loans, investment bank Lehman Brothers went under, and the government swooped in to rescue insurance company American International Group. 
Amid uncertainty, and with the stock markets nosediving, U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke proposed a sweeping $700 billion plan to bailout financial institutions. President George W. Bush and presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain supported Paulson's proposal, which called for the launch of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, described as an effort to stabilize the economy by authorizing the treasury secretary to buy toxic assets, largely comprised of shaky mortgage-backed securities — essentially bad debts. 
Over the next three months, Paulson bolstered banks with $350 billion, according to an evolving summary of the credit crisis by The New York Times. 
Last month, the Times reported that the TARP bailout ""could conceivably earn taxpayers a profit."" However, ""a final accounting of the government's full range of interventions in the economy, including the bailouts of the mortgage financial giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is years off and will most likely remain controversial and potentially costly."" 
At the time, constituents weren't keen on bailing out big banks and other financial institutions. ""For most voters, TARP remains a four-letter word,"" according to the Times. 
Distrust was also simmering in Congress. On Sept. 30, 2008, the Austin American-Statesman reported that the day before, ""three of the four U.S. House members from the Austin area broke with their party leaders Monday and voted against the rescue plan for the financial markets."" Doggett joined Reps. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, and John Carter, R-Round Rock, in voting to defeat the rescue plan. San Antonio Rep. Lamar Smith, a Republican who represents part of Travis County, voted for the legislation. 
""In a sign of just how little weight President Bush carries in even his home state these days, just four of the 19 Texas Republicans in the House voted for his bailout plan,"" the Statesman reported. ""Five of the 13 Texas Democrats voted for it. The local lawmakers voting no all said they wanted Congress to spend more time looking at different solutions to the financial crisis."" 
Doggett had been meeting with William Isaac, who was chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. under President Ronald Reagan, according to the Statesman. Isaac had suggested that the administration could mollify the markets by raising the limit on the amount of deposits insured by the FDIC, among other measures. 
Doggett said: ""It strikes me that these are sensible steps that would address market concerns without such a huge cost to the taxpayer."" 
A Statesman editorial published the same day observed that ""you know a bill is in trouble when conservative Republican John Carter of Round Rock and liberal Democrat Lloyd Doggett of Austin both vote against it."" 
The House killed that measure, 228-205, and the stock market further spiraled. Then, two days later, the Senate voted 74-25 in favor of a modified $700 billion bailout plan. The crux of the legislation was intended to stabilize the economy and prevent further disruption to the economic system by giving the government authority to purchase and insure certain types of troubled assets. 
At the time, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said on Fox News that the Senate bill had a ""much better chance"" of making it through the House, according to an Oct. 2, 2008, Los Angeles Times news story. ""I do think that the big (stock market) drop on Monday really had a chilling effect on a lot of our members and a lot of our constituents,"" he said. The Dow had plunged 800 points, according to a timeline of the crisis by The Washington Post. 
Doggett wasn't won over. ""The Senate measure has changed my position from 'no' to 'heck no,'"" he said, according to the Times. 
On the floor of the House Oct. 3, Doggett suggested the bailout was a rash, irresponsible use of taxpayer dollars. ""What Bush demands on this subrprime lending debacle is for taxpayers to reward Wall Street with what is essentially the biggest subprime loan in American history,"" he said. ""We cannot afford to give almost unlimited discretion to one man to determine what toxic securities to buy and on what terms. We should not bail out the entire world."" 
The Senate approach cleared the House Oct. 3, 2008 by 263-171. 
In the Texas delegation, nine Democrats and six Republicans voted yes, while four Democrats and 13 Republicans voted no. The Texas delegates who switched votes between versions of the bailout — going from ""no"" to ""yes"" — were Al Green, D-Houston, Mike Conaway, R-Midland, Mac Thornberry, R-Clarendon, Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, Solomon Ortiz, D-Corpus Christi, and Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo. 
Doggett was quoted in the Oct. 3 American-Statesman saying: ""When markets are poisoned, you demand the best antidote to that poison ... not yield to President Bush's take-it-or-leave-it demand."" 
So, Doggett twice voted against the TARP measure, the plan since widely called a ""bailout.""

Alan Grayson says Dan Webster would ""force"" rape and incest victims ""to bear their attacker's child""
","
In his new toned-down version of the ""Taliban Dan"" attack ad, Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., one of the most outspoken Democrats in the House, narrows his focus to three points. 
The first ad, released Sept. 25, 2010, garnered mostly negative attention for labeling his Republican challenger, former state House Speaker Daniel Webster, ""Taliban Dan."" PolitiFact Florida looked at Webster's longstanding connection to a conservative Christian group and ruled one part of that ad False and another part Half True.

On Oct. 6, 2010, the Grayson camp released a new ad that covers much of the same territory, but which eliminates some of the more provocative language and claims from the first ad. As soon as we heard about the new ad, we knew we had to fact-check all the claims.

Here's a full transcript of the new ad:

Daniel Webster's Washington backers are attacking Alan Grayson on women's issues. The facts on Webster's record:

Fact: Webster sponsored a bill to create a form of marriage that would trap women in abusive relationships.

Fact: Webster is an advocate for a group that teaches that mothers should not work outside the home.

Fact: Webster would force victims of rape and incest to bear their attacker's child.

Those are the facts. Don't let Daniel Webster make the laws we will have to live with. 
Here are our fact-checks for the first of those claims (True) and for the second (Barely True). The one we'll check now is the claim that Webster ""would force victims of rape and incest to bear their attacker's child.""

First, we tried to confirm Webster's position on abortion.

His campaign website has a section titled ""Sanctity of Life"" that says, ""Daniel Webster would support legislation that the Constitutional protections of life and liberty extend to the unborn."" He also earned the most stringent anti-abortion rating (and an endorsement) from the Republican National Coalition for Life -- ""pro-life without discrimination."" And we saw a 1996 St. Petersburg Times profile that reported that Webster ""opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest.""

We checked with his campaign to confirm whether he is opposed to abortion even in cases of rape and incest, and a spokeswoman confirmed it.

So Grayson's ad is correct on Webster's philosophical beliefs about abortion. But does that mean that Webster ""would force victims of rape and incest to bear their attacker's child""?

We don't think that's so clear-cut, since Webster's legislative efforts on abortion, while extensive, have stopped well short of what Grayson's ad suggests.

Webster's legislative record is extensive, having served 28 consecutive years representing the Orlando area. He was elected to the state House in 1980 and was re-elected until 1998. He then served in the state Senate from 1998-2008. From 1997-1998 he served as House speaker, the first Republican to hold that position since 1875.

There is no question that Webster was a consistent opponent of abortion throughout his career in Tallahassee. Webster earned a 100 percent ""A"" rating from the Christian Coalition of Florida his last four years in the state Senate -- one of only two to receive a perfect rating each year.

In 1988, Webster sponsored a law requiring parental consent for some abortions by minors. The law passed, but ultimately was ruled unconstitutional.

As speaker in 1997, he helped pass two bills seeking to limit abortions. The first, the Woman's Right to Know Act, required doctors to give women seeking abortions special pamphlets explaining the procedure and listing alternatives. The second bill banned a controversial and rare type of late-term abortion.

In 1998, he voted in favor of a parental notification bill. This bill was passed, but then vetoed.

Meanwhile, in 2004, while serving in the state Senate, Webster proposed a bill that would create guardians for unborn children. The bill did not pass.

In 2005, he helped author legislation that required parents be notified if their minor child was intending to get an abortion. This bill passed and was signed into law.

And in 2008, his final year in elected office, Webster proposed a bill that would require women getting an abortion to first have an ultrasound of the fetus performed. That bill failed on a 20-20 vote in the Senate. (A similar bill passed this year, before being vetoed by Gov. Charlie Crist.)

Two of these bills did not have exceptions for rape or incest victims, but we don't think they provide sufficient support for the ad's sweeping statement about Webster's intentions about rape and incest victims. The 1997 late-term abortion bill addressed a rare sub-segment of all abortions, while the 1998 parental notification bill affected minors only and provided them with the right to notify a judge instead of their parents.

All told, this represents a lot of legislative activity on abortion. However, our review of Webster's time in the Legislature also uncovered a pattern of pragmatism.

Most strikingly, in 2006, after South Dakota passed a sweeping abortion ban, Webster decided against attempting to enact a similar law in Florida. South Dakota's anti-abortion law banned abortion in all cases -- including rape or incest -- only allowing it in order to save the life of the mother. Webster said that the climate in Florida wasn't right for such a bill, particularly after the heated debate over whether the government should intervene in the case of Terri Schiavo, a brain-damaged woman who died after a feeding tube was removed at her husband's request. The Schiavo case became a cause celebre for opponents of abortion.

""Based on the vote last year on the Terri Schiavo issue, it appears the the climate in the Florida Senate is not right for pro-life legislation,"" Webster said.

Two years later, when he proposed the ultrasound legislation, Webster included exemptions for victims of rape, incest, domestic violence or human trafficking.

""I'm pro-life, so I want to see as many people at least think as long as they can about it,"" Webster said during the 2008 ultrasound bill debate. ""There's nothing I can do about changing the law. Abortions are going to be offered. But I'd like to at least give (women) the very best information.""

So where does this leave us? There is no question that Webster believes that abortion should be banned except to save the life of the mother, and that gives the Grayson campaign a lot of cover for its charge. But this fact doesn't support the ad's claim completely. By charging that Webster ""would force victims of rape and incest to bear their attacker's child,"" the ad steps beyond the realm of a candidate's personal belief and into the realm of what they would actually do if elected to office. 
It's impossible to know precisely what abortion bills Webster would propose or support if he were to be elected to the U.S. House. We asked Webster's campaign how he would vote if a bill were to come up in Congress restricting abortion in cases of rape and incest, but he declined to answer the question because it is a ""hypothetical."" They added that of his thousands of votes in the legislature, Webster did not sponsor or vote for such a measure. 
A close examination of his legislative career suggests that his hard-line philosophy has been tempered by a more pragmatic streak at times. Most strikingly, when Webster was faced with a 2006 South Dakota model that would do pretty much what Grayson said Webster would support, Webster declined to forge ahead, even as some abortion opponents urged such an effort.

The Grayson camp discounts this example, saying it's only natural for a politician to advance his philosophy when the time is right and hold back when it's not expedient. They have a point. Still, Grayson's charge has a substantial grounding in the truth, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/07/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-says-dan-webster-would-force-rape-and/

Ohio Secretary of State candidate Jon Husted raps opponent Maryellen O’Shaughnessy for 'her own stimulus package'
","
Republican Ohio Secretary of State candidate Jon Husted slammed opponent Maryellen O’Shaughnessy in a recent television advertisement as a career politician who once passed legislation to increase her own pay.

O’Shaughnessy, of Columbus, has heard the criticisms before. But that didn’t stop Husted from recycling them within a more current anti-Democrat framework.

""O’Shaughnessy even voted for her own personal stimulus package – a taxpayer-funded pay raise for herself,"" the commercial’s narrator says.

It’s an accusation O’Shaughnessy has heard before. Her opponent in a 2002 race for Franklin County Commissioner, Dewey Stokes, also produced a TV commercial that ripped O’Shaughnessy for raising her own pay, according to the Columbus Dispatch.

O’Shaughnessy’s campaign said she couldn’t be blamed for boosting her pay because she was ineligible for the raise after she and the rest of Columbus City Council approved it.

So what’s the truth here. PolitiFact Ohio asked Husted’s camp to back up its statement.

It pointed to an ordinance Columbus City Council passed in December 1998 to increase the salaries of council members, the council president and the mayor. The ordinance, which passed unanimously 7 to 0, increased the pay of council members and the council president 34 percent in 2000, with annual bumps of 3 percent in the next three years. That meant pay for City Council members jumped from $25,000 in 1999 to $36,607 in 2003. The pay for council president jumped from $30,000 to $44,037 over the same time. All seven members of council, including O’Shaughnessy, declined the pay raise in 2003.

The Columbus city charter discourages officeholders from voting to increase their own pay with language that says a member of council must first be elected before collecting the higher pay. ""The salary of any officer, employee, or member of a board or commission in the unclassified service of the city who was elected or appointed for a definite term shall not be increased or diminished during the term for which the individual was elected or appointed…"" the charter reads.

So while the pay increases council approved at the end of 1998 kicked in beginning in 2000, O’Shaughnessy was ineligible for the pay hikes in 2000 and 2001, the last two years of her first term. She didn’t qualify for a higher salary until after re-elected in 2001. She qualified for a higher salary of $35,541 when she started her new term in the beginning of 2002.

What all this means is that when O’Shaughnessy voted in favor of the 1998 ordinance to increase pay, there was no guarantee she would ever get the higher pay. She had to win re-election first.

That’s an important caveat that Husted’s ad doesn’t mention, and the point where Hustad’s attack comes unraveled.  

She didn’t approve a pay raise for herself. She voted to increase pay for whomever was elected to take that council seat. The voters decided she should get the pay raise by re-electing her in 2001.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Message Machine 2010', 'Adam Kinzinger']","
Adam Kinzinger says ""hundreds of thousands"" of Illinois jobs lost during Debbie Halvorson's career
","With unemployment rates near their post-World War II highs, it's no surprise that challengers have been attacking incumbents for the nation's weak employment numbers. One who's taken that tack is Adam Kinzinger, the Republican nominee running against Rep. Debbie Halvorson, D-Ill., in a sprawling district south of Chicago.

In a recent television ad, Kinzinger said, in part, ""Since Debbie Halvorson has been in politics, Illinois has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs."" We thought it would be worth checking Kinzinger's numbers.

Checking the claim seemed like it would be straightforward. But we hit some unexpected twists that first had us thinking the claim would be False, then True, then somewhere in the middle.

The first thing we did was to turn to Halvorson's official biography to determine when she first entered politics. From 1993 to 1996, she served a term as clerk of Crete Township, Illinois. In 1996, she ran for state Senate and won, serving until 2008, including three years as the chamber's majority leader. Then, in 2008, Halvorson was elected to her first, and current, term in the U.S. House.

While some may balk at describing the job of Crete Township clerk as being ""in politics"" -- a Kinzinger spokesman noted that the position has little or no influence on the statewide economy -- it is an elected position serving a geographical entity with 26,650 residents. So by our book, that counts as being ""in politics.""

Next, we went to our trusted source for employment and unemployment statistics -- the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The BLS calculates a wide variety of employment indicators, both nationally and within each state.

We looked up the non-farm, seasonally adjusted employment figures for Illinois, which is the broadest, most widely used job statistic. Economists typically count ""lost jobs"" by comparing the total employment on one date to the total employment on another date.

If you count from 1993 until today, the state of Illinois gained a net 310,500 jobs. Repeat: Gained, not lost.

Now, to be fair, we also noticed that if you were to start counting from Halvorson's swearing-in as a state senator in 1997, the state had lost 135,000 jobs. And if you were to start at the beginning of her term in Congress, the state had lost 208,000 jobs.

But counting from the start of Halvorson's political career in 1993, which we determined was the most accurate approach, the claim appeared to be False.

That is, until the Kinzinger camp provided some alternative numbers.

A Kinzinger spokesman sent us to a web page posted by the Illinois Department of Employment Security. This page provided a new statistic -- the actual number of unemployed Illinois residents, measured every month from January 1976 until the present.

According to these statistics, there were 449,300 unemployed people in Illinois in January 1993, and that number had grown to 671,400 by August 2010. That's 222,100 more unemployed people today than when Halvorson started. So using that measurement, it appeared Kinzinger was correct.

Why the difference? The expanding labor force. Since January 1993, the Illinois labor force has grown by 598,800 people, as people have moved into the state and as Illinois children have grown old enough to begin working. So that makes it possible for there to be more unemployed people even as the state has experienced a net gain of jobs.

So does this mean the statement should be rated True? Not necessarily.

The numbers cited by the Kinzinger camp refer to the increasing number of unemployed people in Illinois. But that doesn't exactly mean that hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost. Instead, it could mean that the state has failed to create hundreds of thousands of jobs to keep pace with population growth and new entrants into the work force. That's a similar point, but it's not exactly the same thing.

The ad compounds the confusion by using an on-screen visual to back up Kinzinger's jobs claim. It says, ""683,682 out of work,"" which is the number of unemployed Illinois residents in July 2010, according to the Illinois Department of Employment Security. Here's the problem: Not only is that not a jobs-lost figure, it's also a snapshot of one month's unemployment, even though the ad is talking about the jobs lost over a nearly 18-year period.

Kinzinger would have been entirely justified making an ad that said the state had lost 135,000 jobs since Halvorson had been elected to the legislature, or 208,000 jobs since she was elected to Congress. Certainly it would have made for an easier fact-check. But he didn't. Instead, we're left with one valid statistic that the state gained 310,500 jobs during Halvorson's political career, and another statistic that shows that the state's economy fell far behind in creating enough jobs to keep up with population growth. The math can be complicated, but this one adds up to Half True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/07/adam-kinzinger/adam-kinzinger-says-hundreds-thousands-illinois-jo/
"['Federal Budget', 'Infrastructure', 'Transportation', 'Wisconsin', 'Raymond LaHood']","
Transportation Secretary Raymond LaHood says nothing can stop high-speed rail project in Wisconsin
","
When it comes to the proposed $810 million high-speed rail link between Milwaukee and Madison, Wisconsin’s gubernatorial candidates are on opposite sides of the tracks.

Democrat Tom Barrett strongly favors the link, one of 13 rail projects nationwide that are part of an $8 billion federal stimulus allocation. President Barack Obama has made the projects a cornerstone of his transportation agenda. And outgoing Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle is hustling to get the Milwaukee-to-Madison train rolling.

Meanwhile, Republican gubernatorial hopeful Scott Walker has vowed repeatedly to stop the project  ""dead in its tracks.""

That’s a strong statement.

So is this one from U.S. Transportation Secretary Raymond LaHood, who on two separate visits to Wisconsin flatly declared the train could not be stopped.

""It’s coming,"" he said at a Labor Day rally in Milwaukee. ""Nobody can stop this train.""

LaHood’s statement was not one of opinion, a promise for the future or a prediction on what is likely to happen. It was stated as fact.

So we wondered: Is it true none can stop the project?

We tried to talk to LaHood, a former Republican U.S. House member from Illinois, minutes after his Labor Day speech, but he declined to be interviewed. His office refused follow up interview requests.

Like Walker, Republicans running for governor in several other states have declared their opposition to proposed high-speed rail lines.

In Ohio, John Kasich has vowed to block the ""3C"" train that would link Columbus, Cleveland and Cincinnati; In Florida, Rick Scott opposes service between Tampa and Orlando; and in California, Meg Whitman is against a San Francisco-Los Angeles line.

For his part, LaHood has called the rail projects an important economic development tool and is baffled by the opposition.

""We're talking about nothing short of transforming transportation much the same way the interstate highway system did under President Eisenhower,"" LaHood wrote on his blog Oct. 5, 2010, a day after a New York Times article looked at opposition to the projects. ""Can you imagine if Ohio or Wisconsin or any other state had said, ""No, thanks -- we don't think that highway thing is going anywhere?""

Let’s start with a little background on the Wisconsin project.

In January, the state’s application for an extension of Amtrak’s Milwaukee-Chicago Hiawatha line won $810 million in federal funds. Plans call for service to reach 79 mph in 2013 and 110 mph by 2015 -- actually not a high speed train compared with ""bullet train"" service of up to 220 mph planned in other parts of the country.

The federal government agreed to pay the full cost of building the line, but the state would be required to spend an estimated $8 million a year to run it. The state agreed to buy two 14 car train sets from the Spanish company Talgo for $47 million. Those trains would be built at the former Tower Automotive site on Milwaukee’s north side, creating an initial 125 jobs.

Despite the opposition, and the uncertainty of who will win the Nov. 2 election, the Doyle administration in August announced plans to dramatically escalate spending on the train -- from about $50 million to $300 million in 2010 alone.

By the end of the year, the state will have spent or entered into contracts for nearly $300 million but won't necessarily have spent that much, according to Cari Ann Renlund, and aide to state Transportation Secretary Frank Busalacchi.

The breakdown: $52.4 million for design work on stations and the overall rail corridor, $140 million in contracts for work on building raised land bridges, and up to $100 million in contracts for steel and railroad ties.

Of course, a new governor -- and new Legislature -- will take office in January. What could happen then?

DOT’s Renlund scheduled and canceled two interviews on the topic. Meanwhile, LaHood’s press secretary Olivia Alair refused to discuss what could happen: ""We’re not going to get into speculation about hypothetical scenarios.""

So we turned to Walker and asked him how he plans to stop a speeding train.

He laid out several scenarios:

Tie the purse strings. Walker said he would refuse to authorize the annual state operational funding. ""If we don’t appropriate that, they can’t operate the train,"" he said, calling it ""the easiest, most direct approach.""

Cancel the contracts already approved. This could prompt its own legal fight, including from companies who have signed contracts to build trains and supply materials. Walker downplayed that likelihood, arguing ""they’re not going to completely alienate themselves"" from getting other state work by fighting too hard over the train.

Go to court. Walker hinted he might seek an injunction against the train -- even before the election arguing the state shouldn’t have sped up the work.

Walker noted the Marquette Interchange was just rebuilt, in part, with federal money that had been set aside years ago for a light-rail system. A similar nothing-can-stop-this declaration back then would not have held much water.

Outside experts agreed the train could be stopped, focusing on control by a Gov. Walker of the state Transportation Department. He would probably succeed in canceling the contract with the federal government, they said.

""I think he’s got the power to say no,"" said Erich Zimmermann, senior policy analyst with Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan Washington D.C. watchdog group.

Steven Polzin, director of mobility policy research at the Center for Urban Transportation Research, University of South Florida, Tampa, said that control of the state Transportation Department is probably the most powerful tool Walker would have.

""They could choose not to pursue that project,"" said Polzin.

Zimmermann noted there could be significant economic and political costs to the state if the contracts were cancelled. And Polzin, whose group has been criticized by some for favoring cars over rail, argues the projects have not been adequately studied before they were approved.

As for the $810 million, Walker said he would urge Congress to allow the state to use the money for other transportation purposes, such as roads. He noted if Republicans win the House, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, would likely become chairman of the Budget Committee, and may look favorably on that. Of course, Obama would still be around with his veto pen.

Zimmermann and Polzin say the cash is likely to just go to rail projects in other states.

Of course, all of this gets us well past election day and campaign pledges. By then, whoever is governor may face heavy pressure from business leaders with train-related contracts, labor unions and community leaders to keep the project -- and related jobs -- moving ahead.

So, let’s bring this all back to the starting point.

In his enthusiastic support for the Milwaukee-to-Madison train, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has proclaimed -- twice -- that the train could not be stopped. That statement overlooks an obvious obstacle: the voters. If Walker wins, experts say he will have numerous avenues open to him to stop the project, even though those steps may carry repercussions. And if Congress turns red, he would have a major ally in the effort.

"['Oregon', 'Education', 'Chris Dudley']","
In first debate with John Kitzhaber, Chris Dudley says Oregon’s school system ranks 43rd nationally
","
During the first, and possibly only, gubernatorial debate, Republican candidate Chris Dudley addressed the need for statewide educational reform. To underscore the necessity, he mentioned -- twice -- that Oregon’s school system ranked 43rd nationally.

""I was disappointed that when, in the Race to the Top, Oregon's application, we were graded an F, and then when it was time to reapply we decided not to even do it,"" Dudley said, referring to a national grant competition funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (better known as the stimulus). ""And this is when our school system has been ranked 43rd in the nation. Instead of racing to the top, Oregon has decided to run for the hills.

""We have to look at reform. We absolutely have to. When you're at 43rd, you have to look at how do you change it, how do you make it better.""

Everything Dudley said seemed to track with previous reports in The Oregonian about Race to the Top: Oregon didn’t do too well in the first call for applications and then passed on applying for the second round.

But his claim that Oregon ranked 43rd nationally stuck with us -- especially because he kept repeating the claim (we counted five mentions in total). We wondered whether it would hold up to scrutiny.

Dudley’s campaign pointed us to Education Week’s most recent Quality Counts, an annual report of the state of education in the United States. A look at the press releasethat accompanied the most recent report bore out Dudley’s claim. Oregon did show up 43rd overall.

But, as with most complicated rankings, not everybody thinks Quality Counts offers the best picture of how Oregon stacks up against other states. For instance, Oregon earned its lowest score -- and, in fact, the lowest in the nation -- on ""teacher preparation and support.""

The Oregon Coalition for Quality Teaching and Learning, made up of the leading education policy organizations in Oregon, released a statementafter the most recent Quality Counts report.

The coalition said Oregon’s score on teacher preparation was skewed because of the way some of the questions were asked. One example: Quality Counts asks whether Oregon requires all ""prospective teachers from traditional preparation programs to pass written tests in subject specific knowledge.""

For the most part, Oregon does. But, the coalition notes, the state provides for some leeway. The state does allow alternative assessments in specific cases. But the number is low. In the 2006-07 school year (the year the state used when filling out the survey), only 0.5 percent of the state’s prospective teachers took this alternative assessment. That’s just 21 teachers statewide.

Because of the 21, however, Oregon was given no credit for that question.

More broadly, the coalition says the report is biased in its preference for statewide education measures, something that penalizes Oregon, where local control in setting policies is generally preferred.

Christopher Swanson, the vice president of Editorial Projects in Education (the publisher of Education Week), said that some of those concerns are valid, particularly the bit about local control. ""This is kind of a report and report card looking at state policies and education trends and to the extent that the state is an actor,"" Swanson said. ""States with more local control will tend not to score as high.""

As for the teacher prep question, he doubts Oregon’s ranking would have changed all that much even if the score on that section had improved some.

Either way, it didn’t seem right to let this study be the final word on Oregon’s school system, partly because it doesn’t focus on student achievement -- which is how many parents judge school quality.  PolitiFact Oregon dug around for some other possible measurements.

Susanne Smith, a spokeswoman for Oregon's superintendent for public instruction, pointed us toward the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a standardized test. The test, she said, offers ""an apples-to-apples measure"" of student performance nationally.

Oregon did better than 43rd on all counts on scores for 2009. Fourth-grade students ranked 35th and 36th in math and reading, respectively. Eighth-graders ranked 25th and 26th.

Of course, those national test scores are pretty narrow in what they reveal. They speak only to student performance and not to the system as a whole. To get a good idea of where Oregon -- or any other state -- ranks overall is difficult, Smith said. ""Every state creates their own content standards, what students should know and learn. Then, based on those standards, they have their own accountability system.""

For the final word, we turned to Oregon Stand for Children, a student advocacy group made up largely of parents. Sue Levin, the executive director, said that Dudley used the same 43 number in his endorsement interview with the organization. (The organization has so far endorsed neither Dudley nor John Kitzhaber, his Democratic opponent.)

""I thought about it afterward and I didn't feel -- let's put it this way: In every measure of educational quality that I have ever seen, Oregon tends to be in the bottom third, so therefore we're somewhere between 34 and 50.""

PolitiFact Oregon takes a similar view. Dudley is clearly cherry-picking one ranking out of dozens, but he did accurately quote a well-known educational study. Other rankings do place Oregon on the lower end of things. So, we rate this claim Mostly True.
