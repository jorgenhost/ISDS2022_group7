Valerie Jarrett says 'nothing in Obamacare forces people out of their health plans.'
","The White House has been on the defensive recently over its claim, repeated numerous times over the years, that under President Barack Obama’s health care law, if you like your health plan, you can keep it. His claim hasn’t worn well amid the letters to hundreds of thousands of Americans with individually purchased insurance plans notifying them that their plans are being canceled. Typically, these policies no longer meet the requirements in Obama’s law, such as the need to cover emergency care, maternity care, mental health or prescription drugs. In August 2012, we gave a Half True to Obama’s claim that ""if you're one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance."" A more careful phrasing -- former Obama adviser David Axelrod’s claim that ""the vast majority of people in this country are keeping their (health insurance) plan"" -- recently earned a Mostly True rating. But critics of the law have been on the attack about what they call Obama’s broken promise. Defending the law, White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett sent out this message via Twitter on Oct. 28, 2013: ""FACT: Nothing in #Obamacare forces people out of their health plans. No change is required unless insurance companies change existing plans."" Is it really a ""fact"" that ""nothing in Obamacare forces people out of their health plans""? The White House appears to think so. Asked about Jarrett’s tweet at a White House press briefing the following day, Press Secretary Jay Carney backed up her view that it’s the insurers’ fault -- not the administration’s -- if plans are being canceled. It’s insurers who are choosing to close plans, Carney said, noting that ""the administration doesn’t step in"" to force cancellations. Instead, he said, ""the insurer is making a decision to basically cancel the plan and reissue or offer the individual a new plan with different benefits or different costs."" While it’s technically true that the insurer makes the final decision, their choices are, to a great degree, limited by the law and the way it’s been implemented by the administration. Much of this process has to do with the arcane process of ""grandfathering"" plans that existed prior to the law’s enactment in March 2010. Under the law, insurance plans -- either those purchased through an employer or on the individual market -- may be ""grandfathered"" if they have operated continuously since before the law’s enactment and have made no significant changes. This means the insurer can keep the insurance plan essentially as is, without having to implement many (though not all) of the new law’s requirements, such as mandatory coverage for emergency and maternity care. But experts say the regulations defining what constitutes a significant change are pretty tight. As our colleagues at the Washington Post Fact Checker pointed out, one of the regulations says that grandfathered status must end if copayments increase by more than $5.00 plus the cost of medical inflation. And once a plan is poised to lose its grandfathered status, it’s on the road to oblivion. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, known as HIPAA, says that if an insurer wants to end a policy, it needs to give policy holders 90 days notice as well as information about alternative coverage plans that insurer is offering. That’s essentially the message that many individual-market policyholders are receiving in the mail these days, and that is attracting so much attention. Health policy experts told us that, in a technical sense, insurers are pulling the plug on these old, grandfathered policies. Echoing what Jarrett tweeted, Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University law professor, said that ""if a grandfathered plan is being terminated, it is the insurer’s decision -- nothing in the law requires it."" But other experts said that while this is technically true, it gives a distorted view of what’s going on. The law places grandfathered plans in such a straitjacket -- unable to attract new individual policyholders and unable to adjust terms to market conditions -- that it’s only a matter of time before companies are driven to pull the plug. To ignore the government’s role in establishing the parameters for this highly regulated, and highly competitive, industry is substantially misleading. Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, called Jarrett’s message ""word games."" ""Insurance companies cannot continue to sell individual policies that don’t meet the requirements of the essential benefit package, either to individuals or to small businesses, as of Jan. 1,"" Wilensky said. ""But since the insurance companies are not allowed to continue to sell these plans that the person previously had bought and may have liked, they are effectively being forced to change their plan."" Austin Frakt, a health care economist at Boston University who generally supports Obamacare, agreed that ""Jarrett's statement misses an important point."" By all accounts, even the employers who are offering grandfathered plans to their employees are dwindling over time. The annual study of health insurance by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust found that the percentage of workers enrolled in grandfathered plans has decreased from 56 percent in 2011 to 36 percent in 2013. Another study, by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, found that of the one-quarter of organizations that still have a grandfathered plan, less than half expect to keep their grandfathered status beyond the next two years. In other words, the grandfathered plan is slowly but steadily becoming a dinosaur. Beyond the question of grandfathering, Frakt sees another element of the law that could strongly encourage -- though again perhaps falling short of requiring -- changes in health insurance plans. A 40 percent excise tax on high-benefit plans is set to take effect on Jan. 1, 2018. While that’s several years away, the provision ""will change plans, either by making them more costly or incentivizing redesigns to get below the premium cap,"" Frakt said. The irony here, both Wilensky and Frakt said, is that there are ways to describe what’s going on that are both more broadly accurate and more flattering to the policy changes being undertaken. The administration’s ""better argument is that we are making sure people have ‘real’ insurance that will be guaranteed to cover them when they need it,"" Wilensky said. Frakt concurred. ""The right view of this is that the law does motivate or force change, and that's a virtue,"" he said. Our ruling Jarrett said it was a ""fact"" that ""nothing in Obamacare forces people out of their health plans."" Saying there’s ""nothing"" in the law that forces people out of their health plans is a pretty extreme claim -- one that implies that insurers who pull the plug on non-Obamacare-compliant plans are acting in some sort of government-free vacuum. Even if it’s technically true that the insurer pulls the plug on a plan, the insurer will only be doing this because the law itself and its implementing regulations have created a context in which, sooner or later, old-fashioned plans will inevitably pass into oblivion -- as the law always intended. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2013/oct/30/valerie-jarrett/valerie-jarrett-says-nothing-obamacare-forces-peop/

Dick Cheney says daughter's opponent Mike Enzi gets larger percentage of PAC money than any other senator
","Some fathers help their daughters by teaching them how to ride a bike. But if you’re Dick Cheney, you do it by attacking her political rival on national television. The former vice president appeared on ABC’s This Week on Oct. 27, 2013, to discuss national security issues, and was asked about the Republican primary battle in Wyoming between incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi and his daughter, Liz Cheney. Though Liz Cheney has previously said her father wouldn’t be campaigning for her, he didn’t pass on the opportunity to take a few shots at Enzi. He accused the three-term senator of ""getting about 84 percent of his campaign funds from Washington-based PACs,"" which Cheney said was ""more than any senator of either party."" Enzi is far from the most prestigious, vocal or well-known lawmakers on the Hill. So we were surprised to hear that the three-term senator from Wyoming, of all places, is the upper chamber’s leader in percentage of donations from PACs. We decided to take a deeper look. Counting PAC money Off the bat, we ran into trouble with the term ""Washington-based PAC."" The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign finance data, noted that most political action committees, but not all, are based in the nation’s capitol, and it’s difficult to separate which of Enzi’s donors are from D.C. ""What's probably safe to say is that the vast majority are not based in his home state,"" Viveca Novak at the center told PoltiFact (which is what Cheney was driving at anyway). According to data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics, in the Senate campaign cycle beginning in 2009, Enzi raised $1.64 million, with $1.19 million, or 73 percent, coming from PACs. That’s not the 84 percent figure that Dick Cheney mentioned. Liz Cheney’s campaign said they got to 84 percent by including a $74,463 transfer to the campaign from a joint fundraising committee, as well as $826,000 given to Enzi’s leadership PAC from other political groups. So the Cheney campaign counted those transfers as PAC money, while the center didn’t. Using the center’s data, Enzi’s percentage of PAC money is higher than any other senator -- by quite a bit actually. The next closest is Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., who has received 66 percent of his donations from PACs in the last five years. The disparity is even larger over the course of Enzi’s entire career. Nearly 70 percent of the $6.55 million the Wyoming Republican has raised since 1991 comes from PACs. In second is Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, at a distant 52 percent. A large chunk of Enzi’s PAC money comes from congressional leadership groups who are backing the senior senator over Cheney’s challenge. He gets quite a bit from health groups, as well -- which isn’t surprising, since he has worked prominently on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee for years. It’s not that Enzi is taking more money from PACs than all of his colleagues, but a higher proportion of his money raised is from these outside groups It’s worth noting that of the 10 senators who have relied the most on PACs this cycle, nearly all hail from states in the bottom third of the population rankings. Candidates from smaller states have a shallower pool of in-state donors to pull from, pushing them to rely on PACs in their increasingly expensive election fights. Cheney has proven to be a formidable fundraiser, pulling in $1 million between July and September, for her contest against Enzi. Doug Weber at the Center for Responsive Politics had another explanation for Enzi’s reliance on PACs. ""Enzi hasn't really raised and spent much in the past,"" Weber said in an email. ""His 2002 and 1996 elections were the cheapest Senate victories of their cycle. So it may be a function of a modest fundraising effort -- raising from individuals involves a lot more work. (Republican House Speaker John) Boehner raised more from individuals just this year than Enzi has since 1989."" And even though Enzi tops this list, he’s far from the most prolific fundraiser in Washington. In the current Congress, he’s 356th in money raised, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Enzi’s campaign didn’t deny Cheney’s claims. While spokeswoman Kristin Walker noted that two-thirds of Enzi’s individual donors in the last cycle were from Wyoming, she added he ""has always raised the money he needed to be competitive."" Our ruling While Dick Cheney differed from our nonpartisan sources on the final number, the fact remains he was right: Enzi has received a higher proportion of his money from PACs than anyone in the Senate. It’s more a product of circumstances — Enzi’s from a small state and he’s facing a strong challenger — than evidence that Enzi has ""gone Washington,"" as Cheney was implying. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/oct/30/dick-cheney/dick-cheney-says-daughters-opponent-mike-enzi-get-/

Homeland Security warned that the SAVE database is not foolproof way to verify the voter rolls, LWV says
","Florida led an effort to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls last year that faced widespread criticism from county election officials. So Secretary of State Ken Detzner hit the road in October to make amends and unveil a revamped process for round two. During his stop in deep-blue Broward County, Detzner -- an appointee of Republican Gov. Rick Scott -- faced a new heap of criticism. Voting rights activists peppered him with questions about the program Florida will use to purge noncitizen voters, called Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE. ""Using the federal SAVE Program to conduct this ‘cleaning’ of the voter rolls is like taking a chihuahua on a hunting expedition -- it is an inappropriate tool for this application,"" said League of Women Voters President Deirdre Macnab in an Oct. 10 statement, the day after the meeting. ""The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has already warned that this database is not a foolproof means of verifying the voter rolls."" The League of Women Voters filed an amicus brief in a lawsuit currently before the U.S. District 11th circuit challenging the state Division of Elections’ use of the SAVE program. Some of Macnab’s statement is a matter of opinion -- as fact-checkers we won’t weigh in on whether using SAVE is appropriate to search for noncitizens on voter rolls. But we decided to check if the Department of Homeland Security warned that SAVE ""is not a foolproof means of verifying the voter rolls."" Florida’s controversial noncitizen voter purge First, here’s a brief recap of the state’s effort to ferret out noncitizens on the voter rolls before the November 2012 presidential election: Florida started with a list of about 180,000 potential noncitizens and whittled it down to about 2,600 names that later turned into 198. The list was rife with errors -- it even flagged a Brooklyn-born World War II veteran. (The best data PolitiFact Florida could nail down from the state was that there were about 85 noncitizens actually removed as of Aug. 1, 2012.) The first round was based on driver's license data, which was a poor method to identify current noncitizens, because it isn’t updated when someone later obtains citizenship. After a battle with federal officials, Florida gained access to the SAVE program in August 2012. But by then, many county election supervisors were fed up with the timing and process and it was scrapped. Detzner hasn’t indicated when he will start the next round. But unlike last year, the state plans to review the data before sending an electronic file to supervisors with supporting documentation. This time, county election supervisors have the option of accessing SAVE themselves. SAVE database Implemented in 1987, SAVE wasn’t originally intended as a way to clean up voter rolls. SAVE is a Web service used by government agencies to verify immigration status in order to determine if someone is eligible for benefits including Medicaid, housing loans and unemployment. The Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service administer SAVE. During the past couple of years, several states including Florida sought to use SAVE to verify voter rolls. We asked the League of Women Voters for the source of their claim that the department warned that SAVE is ""not a foolproof means of verifying the voter rolls."" The League pointed to a New York Times article about Detzner’s tour which stated, ""In the 2012 agreement with Florida which allowed the state to use the information, the Department of Homeland Security said that the database was not a foolproof way of verifying citizenship."" That agreement between the department  and the state Division of Elections doesn’t use the literal word ""foolproof."" But that's the essence of a Homeland Security fact sheet the state forwarded to us that explains some caveats about using SAVE to verify a voter’s eligibility: ""Because the SAVE program cannot confirm your citizenship status based upon information provided by the agency, you must be given an opportunity by the voter registration agency to provide the correct documentation or correct your records with USCIS and/or appeal the denial of your voter registration. Please note there are a number of reasons why the SAVE program may not be able to verify your citizenship, e.g., the SAVE program can only verify naturalized or derived citizens, to the extent that a derived citizen received an official determination on U.S. citizenship by USCIS. The inability of the SAVE program to verify your citizenship does not necessarily mean that you are not a citizen of the United States and are ineligible to vote."" SAVE is intended to show if someone is not a citizen but it does not contain a database of people who are U.S. citizens. ""SAVE relies on DHS records, which do not include a comprehensive and definitive listing of U.S. citizens..."" stated a letter from the U.S. Justice Department to Detzner in July 2012. For example, if someone has recently participated in a naturalization ceremony and that information isn’t yet loaded into SAVE, then it could be possible for an elections supervisor to obtain outdated information on a voter. ""The information in the database is only as good as the information inputted into the database,"" Christopher Bentley, a spokesman for USCIS, told PolitiFact Florida. When Florida’s state elections director Maria Matthews talked about the SAVE database during a meeting in Sarasota County, she said ""Is it foolproof? No, obviously it's not,"" according to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune. While state elections officials have said SAVE isn’t perfect, Detzner has said: ""This is the best database we have to deal with."" Currently, there are four states with signed DHS agreements to access the SAVE Program for voter verification services: Florida, Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina -- plus five counties in Arizona. Several additional states have pending applications including Virginia, Oregon and Georgia. Our ruling The League of Women Voters in Florida said, ""The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has already warned that this (SAVE) database is not a foolproof means of verifying the voter rolls."" That warning is essentially what the federal government conveyed in a document that explains SAVE may not be able to show citizenship status for all voters. The document didn't use the literal word ""foolproof"" but that is the message that the feds tried to communicate to the state. SAVE is intended to show if someone is not a U.S. citizen -- it is not a full database of people who are citizens. A state elections official said that SAVE isn't ""foolproof,"" but the state argues that it is the best available resource.

"['National', 'Pundits', 'Welfare', 'Charlie Sykes']","
Charlie Sykes says today there are more people on welfare than are working full time
","Welfare reform might have passed in 1996 but the idea of welfare remains one of the raw nerves in American politics. Conservative radio talk show host Charlie Sykes tapped into that theme during his regular morning show on WTMJ in Milwaukee. He teed it up by explaining why the American taxpayer was the ""loser of the day."" ""According to the new census data, the number of Americans who receive means-tested government benefits -- welfare -- now outnumbers those who are year-round full-time workers,"" Sykes said. ""Wow. We’ve been struggling, but in terms of the tipping point here, where you have more people who are on these benefit programs, these are the means-tested benefit programs, than the people who are actually working and paying the taxes."" In this fact-check, we’ll look into whether today there are more people getting these benefits than there are full-time workers. By the way, means-tested applies to aid that comes only if the person is poor enough to qualify. The programs include Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps), subsidized housing and several others which we’ll mention below. We asked Sykes where he got his information and he sent us a link to an article that appeared on the CNS News website. CNS News is a project of the Media Research Center, a conservative group that aims to counter what it sees as liberal bias in the media. The CNS News item accurately cited two reports from the Census Bureau. One report gave the number of 108 million people receiving at least one means-tested benefit. The other gave the number of 101 million people who work full time. The math seems simple, but those reports don’t tell the entire story. Here’s why. Census Bureau includes double counting The original CNS article links to the key Census Bureau tables. The table on recipients of means-tested aid has this note at the top. ""The figures for means-tested programs include anyone residing in a household in which one or more people received benefits from the program."" So, if one person receives Supplemental Security Income, a program for disabled adults, the entire household was included in the tally. As a result, it was possible for full-time workers to be counted as recipients. Another table in the same data collection gives an idea of how common that might be. Out of a total of more than 108 million recipients, there were more than 79 million households with at least one person working. The data don’t say whether that was a full-time worker but the numbers guarantee that the tally of recipients is exaggerated. Time frame Sykes said this was a situation that exists ""now,"" but what is interesting is the article is very clear that this information is from 2011. Here’s the article’s first line: ""Americans who were recipients of means-tested government benefits in 2011 outnumbered year-round full-time workers, according to data released this month by the Census Bureau,"" it said. Sykes spoke about a situation that he said existed today. The economy in 2011 is not the one we have in 2013. Among other big differences, unemployment is lower by 1.4 percentage points. Updating the numbers We went to several agency websites to determine what their participation figures look like today. In every case that we could check, they had declined. Subsidized housing:    The 2011 survey had 13 million. For 2012, we found 9 million. SNAP (food stamps):    The 2011 survey had 49 million. For 2013, we found 47 million. Medicaid:        The 2011 survey had 82 million. For 2013, we found 72 million. TANF (welfare):    The 2011 survey had 5.8 million. For 2013, we found 3.7 million. In contrast, the number of full-time workers went up. The article cited 101 million. In 2013, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 142 million. We are unable to duplicate the Census Bureau method for 2013. It was based on a survey and used statistical techniques to generate its figures. So today there are generally less people receiving some type of government assistance and more people working full time. One final note: The number of recipients includes millions of children under the age of 16 and the elderly. The Census Bureau tally folds in the school lunch program. In the spring of this year, 29 million students benefited from that. About a third of the residents of public housing are over 62. By most standards, we don’t expect these people to work. To compare them to the number of full-time workers might be useful policy information but to fail to note that children and the elderly, not to mention the blind and disabled, are folded into the tally of recipients is highly misleading. Our ruling Sykes said that ""the number of Americans who receive means-tested government benefits -- welfare -- now outnumbers those who are year-round full-time workers."" Sykes ignored that the article he read, in its first line, described the situation in 2011, not today. In addition, current numbers look quite different from 2011 when the country was at a lower point in its slow climb back from a deep recession. The article also pointed to the original data tables where it was clear that at the very least, the numbers could have blurred the distinction between those who work and those who are counted as recipients. The failure to note the large numbers of children and elderly in the recipient group is also a significant lapse in the context of comparing them to the number of full-time workers. We rate the claim False.

Austin's 78702 may have surged in white residents. It's not second in the nation in gentrification
","An Austinite skeptical of a possible city move further suggested that a chunk of East Austin has drawn so much interest, it’s nearly No. 1 nationally. In an October 2013 opinion article in the Austin American-Statesman, neighborhood activist Daniel Llanes, writing with Susana Almanza, objected to a proposed urban farm ordinance, which he said would enable landowners to convert single-family lots to commercial purposes. Speaking to pressures on East Austin, Llanes wrote: ""In 2000, during the creation of our Neighborhood Plan, more than 600 properties were rezoned from industrial and commercial to residential. This transformed this neighborhood, and today it is a downtown neighborhood considered to be one of the most desirable in the nation. These neighborhoods, and the people of color in them, have made lemonade out of the lemon(s) despite a historic racism that has endured for almost 90 years. The result is that 78702 is the second-most gentrified ZIP code in the entire country."" Defining gentrification We know 78702; it’s the inner-city region roughly bounded by Lady Bird Lake to the south, Interstate Highway 35 to the west, Airport Boulevard to the east and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to the north. And it’s the nation’s second-most what? Merriam-Webster defines gentrify as ""to change (a place, such as an old neighborhood) by improving it and making it more appealing to people who have money."" Gentrification, it says, is the ""process of renewal and rebuilding accompanying the influx of middle-class or affluent people into deteriorating areas that often displaces poorer residents."" No doubt, that’s happening in some of Austin’s core neighborhoods, driven in East Austin near the lake by what a May 18, 2011, American-Statesman news story described as a demographic transformation. ""The number of African Americans residing in Central East Austin -- once considered the epicenter of black and brown life in Central Texas -- shrank by 27 percent during the past decade,"" the story said, ""while the number of whites living there increased by 40 percent, and whites surpassed blacks as the second-largest racial or ethnic group. ""African Americans or Hispanics still hold a majority or plurality in most East Austin census tracts,"" the story said. ""But white residents had become the majority in two of the tracts by 2010."" The story said the Hispanic population in Central East Austin also fell -- by 9.3 percent -- during the period, according to the newspaper’s analysis of 2010 census data for 20 tracts roughly bounded by Interstate 35, the lake, U.S. 290 East and U.S. 183. ""The population shifts occurred as a development boom accelerated during the last half of the decade, attracting new residents into predominantly low-income, minority neighborhoods for myriad reasons, including the relatively low property prices there, proximity to downtown and something talked about a lot in Austin: quality of life,"" the story said. Finally, the story noted that discussions of gentrification often are cast against the legacy of the city's 1928 master plan, which segregated blacks to neighborhoods east of what is now I-35, ""creating a painful hard-line history of inequities between east and west, whites and minorities."" Charting increases in white residents Llanes told us that a chart produced by the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a charity focused on education policy, was the basis of the 78702 claim. According to the chart, from 2000 to 2010, the 78702 ZIP code trailed only a Tennessee ZIP code for its increase in white residents. According to the chart, dated June 14, 2012, neighborhoods in 78702 saw a 33 percentage point increase in white residents —  going from 23 percent of the ZIP code’s residents in 2000 to 56 percent in 2010. And that surge, the chart says, trailed only the 39 percentage point increase in white residents of Chattanooga’s 37408 ZIP code. In the decade, 78702 saw an overall population decrease of 5 percent, the chart says. And is the surge in white residents proof that 78702 was No. 2 in gentrification? Not according to the chart’s creator, Michael Petrilli, who said in a June 2012 blog post accompanying a revision of his original chart that his breakdown should not be taken as identifying ZIP codes with the greatest gentrification. In his initial chart, dated June 11, 2013, Petrilli said he ""equated ‘gentrification’ with a significant increase in the white share of a neighborhood’s population. In my defense, I did admit that looking at the numbers by race was far from perfect—gentrification is a socio-economic issue—but census income data by (ZIP) code are not yet available for 2010. Still, I chose to use the ‘gentrification’ word, and it’s reasonable to point out its inaccuracy."" More recently, Petrilli told us by telephone that surges in white residents are ""obviously a very imperfect proxy"" for gentrification. Separately, Ryan Robinson, the city of Austin demographer, replied to our inquiry about 78702 by saying in an email that gentrification is ""way more complex than simple rapid racial change. It really has far more to do with the displacement of lower-income households by higher-income households, regardless of race, resulting in a fundamental change in the character of the neighborhood."" ""But for sure, without question, 78702, or at least certain parts of 78702, are indeed gentrifying,"" Robinson wrote. He added that the ""hard parts to measure are the velocity and spatial extent of gentrification."" 78702 by changes in median income and other prosperity indicators Seeking better ways of gauging the gentrification of 78702, we solicited breakdowns of U.S. Census Bureau data from American-Statesman data editor Christian McDonald; Lloyd Potter, the demographer for the state of Texas; and Elizabeth Mueller, a University of Texas associate professor of architecture. Mueller checked changes in the number of residents living at two times the federal poverty level in the 25 urban ZIP codes that were identified by Petrilli as experiencing the biggest bumps in white residents. She emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that between the 2000 Census and the U.S. Census Bureau’s latest five years of its American Community Survey, taken from 2007 through 2011, the 78702 ZIP code had a 17 percentage point decrease in families living at or below two times the federal poverty level. That placed the ZIP code 12th among the 25 ZIP codes pulled from Petrilli’s list, Mueller said. Potter compiled median household incomes for the nation’s ZIP codes in 1999 and compared them with such incomes as gauged by the latest five years of the bureau’s community surveys. McDonald then helped us focus on how much such incomes changed in ZIP codes with 10,000 residents or more. The result: 78702, home to nearly 20,700 residents in 2011, saw a 12 percentage point improvement in median household income between the 2000 census and the latest five community surveys; it ranked about 300th in such growth among the 1,700 populous ZIP codes that similarly saw increases. Potter also compared the share of residents in ZIP codes in 1999 living at or below the federal poverty level with the share of residents who lived at or below poverty in 2011. According to a spreadsheet he emailed us analyzing the rates in counties home in 2000 to metropolitan areas of 1 million residents or more, 29.4 percent of the residents of the 78702 ZIP code lived in poverty in 1999; the level was 27.2 percent in 2011. The difference of 2.2 percentage points ranked the 78702 ZIP code about 2,000th nationally for its reduction. McDonald, drawing on census data, compared the median value of single-family homes. His spreadsheet indicated that, unadjusted for inflation, this factor in the 78702 ZIP code was up 192 percent, more than $100,000, between the 2000 census and five latest community surveys. This change in value, by percentage, placed the ZIP code 64th among ZIP codes home to 10,000 residents or more, according to the spreadsheet. Definitely gentrifying, but... Finally, we talked through our statistical breakouts with Mueller. She said by phone that while some of the indicators were not ideal for gauging gentrification--changes in residents living at or below the poverty level largely reflects people in public housing, she suggested--a reasonable upshot of our foray is the 78702 ZIP code is ""not the second-most anything"" nationally in terms of gentrification. ""But is this area gentrifying? It is. In Austin, it’s definitely one of the areas experiencing the most dramatic change,"" Mueller said. ""Gentrification is generally about several issues. It’s about displacement of low-income people, its about changing the character of a community, sometimes physically and socially, and it means loss of community voice. Right now, we’re losing low-income residents (in 78702). It’s up for grabs about (losses of) community character and community voice."" Our ruling Llanes said 78702 is the nation’s second-most gentrified ZIP code. According to one breakdown, that East Austin area experienced the nation’s second-greatest urban increase in white residents from 2000 to 2010. However, changes in white residents alone are not an accurate way to measure gentrification, which is multi-factored. By other indicators, including changes in poverty, median household income and the value of single-family homes, 78702 has become more prosperous. Stacked up against other ZIP codes, though, it is not No. 2 nationally. Gentrified? Sure. Second most, nationally? Most evidence indicates otherwise. We rate this claim as False.

Rhode Island Tea Party says soldiers who donate to the tea party face military discipline
","Nothing gets the blood boiling like the discovery that the government is violating basic constitutional rights. So amid the avalanche of tweets we see each day, this one from the Rhode Island Tea Party immediately caught our attention: ""Soldiers Donating to Tea Party Now Face Punishment Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice."" If true, we thought, that's outrageous. The tweet refers to a story at RedFlagNews.com, which had a different word for it. Here's their headline: ""TERRIFYING! Soldiers Donating to Tea Party Now Face Punishment Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice . . . "" The story says that two anonymous soldiers said they were told during a pre-deployment briefing at Fort Hood in Texas that evangelical Christians and members of the tea party were threats to the nation, so any soldier donating to them would be subject to punishment. But the story also quotes a Fort Hood spokesman as saying that, based on a preliminary investigation, the claim reported by Red Flag News ""is not substantiated by unit leadership and soldiers present at this training venue."" The story, under a different headline, is repeated at FoxNews.com. We quickly found that, under military regulations, there are limitations to the political activities that soldiers can engage in, but none this extreme. Most are intended to avoid the impression that the Department of Defense is endorsing a political party or candidate. For example, while they can have a political bumper sticker on their private vehicles, they cannot post a large political sign, banner, or poster on their cars or trucks. Service members are allowed to donate to campaigns and political parties as private individuals, subject to the same laws that apply to all federal employees. When we asked the Department of Defense about the tea party tweet and the Red Flag headline, spokesman Lt. Col. J. Todd Breasseale, called it ""an absurdity of such outlandish proportion, it's almost difficult to take seriously. ""But it's also a kind of un-American, potentially dangerous fear-mongering,"" he said, ""and so I'd like to be as clear as I can here: Service members may donate to any legal cause they choose, and, as long as they do so within the boundaries of the Hatch Act, may involve themselves (out of uniform, without using government equipment, off duty, in a way that implies no government endorsement) in the political process, regardless of party affiliation."" (The Hatch Act is a federal anti-corruption law that restricts the political activities of federal employees. But even those who are not allowed to engage in partisan politics are still permitted to contribute money to political organizations.)   When we contacted the Rhode Island Tea Party to ask about the Twitter message, President Susan Wynne said in a email, ""I was merely sharing the story and is not an endorsement by RI Tea Party. If you find any other information, I'd be happy to see it."" If the tweet was wrong, she said in a subsequent email, it would be deleted. We sent her a copy of Breasseale's statement. Four days later, the tweet was still there. At PolitiFact, we believe people and parties have an obligation to check things out before they blindly pass them along to others. It's true that Red Flag News (motto: ""Aggregating the News that Mainstream Media Distort and Ignore"") originated the over-the-top headline. But Wynne, on behalf of her organization, chose to repeat it, even when the story itself included facts that should have prompted some skepticism. For that reason, we rate the Rhode Island Tea Party's tweet a Pants on Fire!

David Axelrod says 'vast majority' of Americans will keep their health insurance
","It’s the question-du-jour about the new health care law: Are people going to be able to keep their health insurance if they like it? President Barack Obama has several times said yes. But cancellation notices coming in the mail to policyholders tell another story. The contrast between Obama’s promises and what’s playing out in America has led to a fierce political war of words about who lied, who knew what and when, and how Americans will have to deal with the ramifications. Former Obama campaign strategist David Axelrod and Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn debated the issue Monday on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. Coburn: ""You're no longer eligible to buy your own plan, which was the No. 1 promise that the president made to the American people. You cannot get what you had."" Axelrod: ""Most people are going to keep their own plans, senator, and you know that."" Coburn: ""That’s not true."" Moments later, Axelrod made his point again: ""The majority of people in this country, the vast majority of people in this country, are keeping their plan. People who are uninsured are going to have choices they never had before."" In this fact-check, we wanted to dig into what’s happening to the American health insurance system to see what policies are being canceled, how many, why and how you might be affected. A good starting point is to see how Americans get their insurance right now. Using census data, the Kaiser Family Foundation finds that in 2012, a little less than 50 percent of the public got their coverage through an employer-based plan. That is, a business negotiates a contract with an insurance company and offers health coverage to its workers. The second largest group, about 30 percent, gets insurance through either Medicare, Medicaid or both. A third group of people with insurance, about 6 percent, buy policies directly from insurance companies. This is called the individual market. (The remainder of Americans, around 16 percent, are currently uninsured.) The health care law that was passed in 2010 made changes to all three legs of the health insurance stool, but the biggest changes came in the individual market. Before the health care law was passed, the individual market was widely considered a mess. Insurers could turn you down for pre-existing conditions, and none of the insurance was standardized, so if you bought a policy, it wasn’t always crystal clear what you were getting. The law’s goal always had been to get these people into standardized plans that cover a defined list of benefits. As a result, some existing policies did not meet standards set by the new health care law. This is why people in this group may be seeing cancellation notices. Kaiser estimates that 15 million people are in the individual market. They are likely to have a very different experience from the ""vast majority"" cited by Axelrod. In New Jersey and Florida, hundreds of thousands of people have received cancellation notices and more are popping up across the country. It’s unclear how many people in the individual market will be forced to change their plan. And what happens to people who are will vary. People can buy another plan from the same company or shop around. Some of them will be eligible for government subsidies and some will not. This group is where the disruptions are most likely. Another group of people -- about 90 million -- are covered through through Medicare or Medicaid. While the Affordable Care Act does make changes, most notably in something called the Medicare Advantage program, they are not being moved into new coverage plans. That leaves the nearly 150 million people who get their insurance through the plans their employer offer. Those plans could change. But it’s tough to say how substantially, and how much as a result of the health care law. Part of that is because plans change every year. Still, some companies are making changes to bring costs down. For example, UPS is telling their employees that if their spouse can receive health insurance through a different employer, UPS will no longer offer them coverage. That certainly could mean people are not keeping their health care plan. How much of the blame should be shouldered by the health care law is a different matter. We asked a variety of experts to comment on the literal accuracy of Axelrod’s statement. For the most part, regardless of their opinion of the new health care law, they gave Axelrod the benefit of the doubt. ""It’s probably true -- at least for next year,"" said Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H. W. Bush. ""Most employers aren’t going to do anything about the insurance they are offering for 2014 because of the Affordable Care Act."" ""He is absolutely right,"" said Bob Laszewski, a health insurance consultant and head of Health Policy and Strategy Associates. But Laszweski also said Axelrod was intentionally diverting attention from the real problems taking place in the individual market. Gerard Anderson, director of the Center for Hospital Finance and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said, ""I would make the same comment that David Axelrod makes but without any real facts. The people with large employers are not really being impacted by the (health care law) and neither are the Medicare and Medicaid recipients."" Sabrina Corlette, program director at at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, echoed Anderson’s point. For Ted Marmor, a professor of health policy at Yale University, rejected Axelrod’s claim, largely because no one has the hard evidence to back it up or refute it. ""No one has the data to be sure,"" Marmor said. ""Axelrod has no authority for his claim. It is a hope."" But Marmor is among the minority of the experts we consulted. ""It's simply true,"" said Dan Mendelson, CEO of Avalere Health, a Washington health consulting group. ""Most of the lives are in the large corporate customer base and we're seeing virtually no dropping of coverage there."" What does it mean to keep your plan? In the view of some analysts, if the plan offered by an employer changes, it is not the same plan and this would make Axelrod wrong. Chris Conover, a critic of Obamacare and an adjunct scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, said the Affordable Care Act requires that every plan offer certain minimum benefits, such as free preventive care. It also allows children up to age 26 to stay on their parents’ plan. Those and other rules drive up premiums and lead to employers offering different plans. Conover said millions of people ""actually have had to purchase more expensive coverage even if they were perfectly happy with their old coverage."" Axelrod’s office takes a different view. We contacted them and his staff pointed us to a 2013 survey by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans. Based on responses from 966 organizations, including firms both small and large, the survey found that 94 percent were definitely or very likely to continue to offer coverage. In that sense, the majority of Americans would still get insurance through their employer. Still, in the survey, about half of the companies estimated Obamacare would raise costs in the range of 1 to 4 percent. Many businesses, in the range of 30 to 40 percent overall, planned to increase the employee share of premiums, raise their deductibles and in other ways shift costs to workers. But it is important to remember that cost and risk shifting has been with the country for a long time. The Kaiser Family Foundation annual survey of employer plans reports that in the past 10 years, the average share of premiums paid by employees has gone up and the fraction of workers in high-deductible plans has risen steadily since 2006, reaching one fifth of the people in the study in 2013. Richard Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group of insurance companies, said the impact of the health care law takes place within an insurance marketplace that has been far from static. ""There have been year to year changes to policies,"" Zirkelbach said. Of all the factors that drive those changes -- rising medical costs, changes in the health of the people in the insurance pool, and government regulation -- Zirkelbach believes the Affordable Care Act rules are having the largest impact as employers look to 2014. Zirkelbach points especially to the minimum requirements for every insurance plan. The employee benefit survey reports that about three quarters of all plans meet all minimum requirements and need no further changes. Our ruling Axelrod said the vast majority of people are keeping their health care plans. That’s certainly what the 2010 health care law intended. The law was crafted largely to leave in place the health care delivery systems for people who get health insurance either through their employer (about 50 percent of people with insurance) or through the government-managed Medicare or Medicaid programs (about 30 percent). Some changes may be occurring in the employer market that would stop people from keeping the health care plans they have. But the bigger issues are in the so-called individual market, which accounts for about 6 percent of Americans who now have health care. The health care law, in essence, raises standards that will make many plans offered in the individual market obsolete. Experts told us there is no precise data to determine how many people will be forced to change health care plans, but they generally agreed the number will be small this year. The broad consensus is that, for the time being, most people will see changes in their coverage and what they pay for that coverage consistent with changes they have seen with their insurance over the past decade.

Healthcare.gov users 'waive any reasonable right to privacy,' Rep. Barton says
","With a host of technical problems at the healthcare.gov website, critics of President Barack Obama’s health care law have gone on the offensive. Among the claims we've heard recently, Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said people visiting healthcare.gov are unwittingly waiving their privacy rights. Barton told Fox News that there's a problem in the source code that seems to contradict HIPAA, the 1996 law that, among other things, protects the privacy of patients’ sensitive data. ""Hidden in the code, there is a sentence that says you waive any reasonable right to privacy of your personal information, the transiting of it or the storage of it,"" Barton said. We decided to take a peek under healthcare.gov’s hood to see if Barton, the chairman emeritus of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, was right that people are waiving their privacy rights if they use the site. The source code Barton’s spokesman sent us the code he referenced during the hearing. It’s the same code the Washington Post published with their own analysis. This is the website’s HTML markup, which is the main language developers use to write websites. The line in question reads, ""You have no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding any communication or data transiting or stored on this information system."" There’s a couple of important HTML symbols around that section of the code, on lines 1406 and 1411. The section starts with a <!-- and ends with -->. That means all the content in between is ""commented out,"" a web development term that tells everything enclosed to not display on the user’s screen. Clay Johnson, the founder of the company that built President Barack Obama’s 2008 online campaign, said it’s a common technique for developers who want to delete something from a site’s appearance without permanently losing it. The text is also a standard disclaimer for government websites, as an advanced Google search Johnson ran pointed out. It could’ve been easily copied by a developer as placeholder text. Spokeswoman Linda Odorisio of CGI Federal, one of the main government contractors that built the site and was responsible for that portion of code, told us that line wasn’t meant to be in the code at all. Rather, it was meant for exchange employees who have access to consumer data. ""It informs them that their interaction with data in the system is monitored and tracked to ensure consumer privacy,"" she said. Consumer privacy Barton pulled up the code at the hearing as a way of backing up his claim that healthcare.gov isn’t compliant with HIPAA regulations on privacy. Parts of Obama’s law must be compliant with HIPAA, but not the website itself, since HIPAA covers health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses. That doesn’t mean the site doesn’t have privacy regulations in place, as we’ve noted before. The Affordable Care Act outlines processes for ensuring privacy and complying with existing privacy regulations. As for the ""hidden"" code, users can’t legally accept a waiver they can’t see, so they can’t possibly be waiving their right to privacy. The Department of Health and Human Services, the agency that oversees the marketplace, referred us to the site’s privacy policy, which addresses what officials can and can’t do with your sensitive information. They can use what you input only to confirm your eligibility to buy a marketplace premium. In other words, the lines inserted in the code may be embarrassing, but they carry no legal weight. ""It’s bizarre and kind of sad to see that that would even be put in there as a comment note because that doesn’t accurately represent the privacy protections in place,"" said Christopher Rasmussen, a Health Privacy Project senior policy analyst. Our ruling Barton claimed healthcare.gov has ""hidden"" code indicating that consumers waive their rights to privacy when they apply for insurance. The website’s markup does include a sentence along these lines that isn’t visible to the user. But because it’s not displayed to the public, it carries no legal weight and consumers can’t consent to it. Bottom line, it doesn’t change a thing about the privacy protections in place at healthcare.gov.

Water board hasn’t tapped $6 billion lending authority, but that’s not unexpected
","Meeting Texas’ water demands will cost $231 billion by 2060, Texas’ water plan says. Much of that is maintenance and repair, but new water projects will cost $53 billion, and local governments report they’ll need state help to borrow half of that. Yet the Independent Texans political action committee says Texas hasn’t even started using a $6 billion program voters approved in 2011 to help finance water projects. For that and other reasons, the PAC opposes the $2 billion water fund Proposition 6 that Texans will vote on Nov. 5, 2013, according to its white paper published online Sept. 3, 2013. ""Texas voters passed Prop 2 in 2011, with a narrow 1.5% margin,"" the PAC said. ""At the time, voters were assured by Prop 2 supporters ...that the $6B evergreen bonding authority would build critical local water supply projects, create jobs and protect us from drought and wildfire without taxpayer contribution. Yet, the $6B bond program has yet to be tapped. ""The same supporters now say we must ‘act in concert’ with the Prop 2 bonding authority by infusing $2B of seed money to make the 2011 program work."" As it turns out, it’s correct that the state water board hasn’t started using the permission voters granted in 2011 to borrow $6 billion. But why -- and what does that mean for Prop 6? The Texas Water Development Board, created in 1957 after a decade-long drought that ruined thousands of Texas farmers and ranchers, lends money at low rates to communities for local water and wastewater projects, such as reservoirs and pipelines. The board raises money to offer such loans by selling bonds -- basically, big IOU notes that the state eventually pays off. State lawmakers and voters tell the board how many bonds it can sell. The last two rounds of authorization came in 2001, when voters gave permission for the board to issue $2 billion in bonds, and 2011, when voters approved an ""evergreen"" lending cap of $6 billion -- as long as the total amount loaned out never exceeds $6 billion, the board can keep lending without coming back for new authorizations. But again, those are limits, not actual dollars. To date, the board has issued $1.6 billion under 2001’s $2 billion authority, spokeswoman Merry Klonower told us by phone. The board has committed to but not closed on another $173,000 in loans, so the board can set up $187,000 more in loans before it starts using the $6 billion lending cap, she said. The board had predicted in 2011 that it would run out of the 2001 authority in one to two years, Klonower said, and chose not to wait until the Legislature’s next meeting in 2013 to ask for more. ""You don’t want to get to the end of it and start turning communities away,"" she said. An Aug. 30, 2011, fact sheet from the board said that of $3.29 billion in loans since 1957, $1 billion had been lent in the past three years. ""The TWDB estimates that its existing bond authority will be exhausted within the next one to two years,"" and Prop 2 would provide needed authority beyond that, it said. In other words, the board never expected to start using the $6 billion authority until about 2013, according to the agency. It was seeking permission to make those loans in the future. Independent Texans’ white paper said the $6 billion authority had not been tapped because it doesn’t provide incentives including low interest rates and deferred payments. The pace at which the board issued loans slowed after 2010, and lack of such incentives was one reason why, Klonower and House Natural Resources Committee director Elizabeth Fazio told us by phone and email. Water board list of loans Nov. 2011-Oct. 2013  Received Oct. 23, 2013, from water board Fazio, who serves as the staff to legislators on the committee, explained by phone that the water board can’t make a loan unless two things happen. First, a city or other local entity has to apply, and second, the state has to have a guarantee that the loan payments can be made even if the local government defaults (which none have in the board’s history). With general obligation bonds for water projects, Fazio said, the state provided this guarantee itself in 2007 and 2009 by designating enough general revenue cash to cover the payments. Once that money is dedicated, the board can also use it to make the loan terms better for local governments. For example, the board can buy down the interest rate or offer to make the first loan payments for the local entity, until its water project is operational and has paying customers. But general revenue to do that hasn’t matched up with the demand for loans, Fazio said. ""Where there has been a dedication it has been very limited."" Klonower said that when the board was able to offer incentives, the demand for loans ""far exceeded the amount of funds available."" Incentives aren’t the only factor in communities’ decisions to take on water projects, though, she said; the economy and drought conditions weigh in, too. Proposition 6 is intended to provide a stable source of money for such incentives -- namely, a $2 billion chunk of cash that would be transferred out of the state’s rainy day fund. With that money, the board would provide its own guarantees and incentives instead of counting on general revenue being designated for those purposes, as the Legislature did in 2007 and 2009 but did not during the 2011 budget crunch.  If the proposal works as planned, state Rep. Allan Ritter, R-Nederland, who wrote the House legislation, has said it could fund a total of $27 billion in projects over coming decades, because the state could continue lending out money for projects as earlier loans are paid back. Our ruling Independent Texans said that the $6 billion bond program approved by voters in 2011 ""has yet to be tapped."" That’s correct, but the water board didn’t expect to tap into it for a year or two. The pace of lending has slowed, partly because of the lack of incentives the group mentions, but the board is still making loans.

GOP Rep. John Fleming says in Massachusetts, half of primary-care doctors aren't seeing new patients
","As the fallout from President Barack Obama’s health care law takes center stage, some critics are raising concerns about how much access Americans will have to insurance and physicians in the future. On CNN’s State of the Union, Rep. John Fleming, R-La., a physician and a critic of Obamacare, and Ezekiel Emanuel, a health policy specialist at the University of Pennsylvania who supports the law, faced off. At one point, they debated the situation in Massachusetts, where a law similar to Obamacare was signed in 2006. As evidence that the federal law won’t work, Fleming said that in Massachusetts, ""half of the primary care doctors are not accepting new patients."" His point was that even if you have insurance, you won’t necessarily be able to see a doctor. We decided to check Fleming’s statistic to see if it’s correct. The statistic comes from an annual survey by the Massachusetts Medical Society, a professional association founded in 1781 that, among other things, publishes the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. The 2013 edition of the society’s ""Patient Access to Care"" survey -- which was based on 1,137 phone interviews with Massachusetts physicians -- found that 51 percent of family medicine practitioners in the state were accepting new patients. As Fleming indicated, almost exactly half are not. We will point out a few caveats, none of which seriously undercut Fleming’s claim. • While ""family medicine"" is certainly one type of ""primary care doctor,"" there are others. One type, internal medicine doctors, had a lower percentage (45 percent) accepting new patients, but another, pediatricians, had a higher percentage (70 percent). • There is substantial regional variation even within Massachusetts. The largest county in the state, Middlesex, had more doctors accepting new patients, at rates five to eight percentage points higher than the state as a whole. Other counties, such as Suffolk, had rates well below the state average. • Your likelihood of being accepted as a new patient depends heavily on what kind of insurance you have. Family medicine doctors accept 90 percent of new Medicare patients and 70 percent of patients with MassHealth, the state’s vehicle for Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program. The 2013 survey did not look at new-patient acceptance rates for those who had private insurance or for patients with Commonwealth Care or Commonwealth Choice, the programs created under the 2006 law to insure those who previously had no insurance. However, data from the society’s 2011 survey does show a danger sign for those worried that doctors will be unwilling to take patients newly insured by the national health care law. The 2011 survey found that family medicine physicians were significantly less likely to accept new patients with Commonwealth Care or Commonwealth Choice -- 56 percent and 44 percent, respectively -- than they were new Medicare and Medicaid patients. Equally striking, the survey found, the percentage of family doctors taking new patients with any type of insurance has fallen since 2007 from 70 percent to 51 percent. That said, determining whether Massachusetts is out of line on any of these benchmarks is tricky, since comparable data for other states is virtually nonexistent, and the available national data is calculated differently and is several years old. Our ruling Fleming said that in Massachusetts, ""half of the primary care doctors are not accepting new patients."" That number is supported by a credible annual survey of Massachusetts doctors. While this doesn’t necessarily mean the same thing will happen on the national level, the statistic is solid. We rate it True.",/factchecks/2013/oct/29/john-fleming/gop-rep-john-fleming-says-massachusetts-half-prima/

Fla. state senator says texting now tops alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths
","On the first day of Florida’s new texting-while-driving ban, state Sen. Maria Sachs, the Senate Democratic leader pro-tem, was already announcing a proposal to make the law tougher. The new law makes texting while driving a secondary offense, which means an officer can’t ticket a motorist only for typing or reading messages while behind the wheel. Rather, the driver has to first commit another violation, like swerving or running a red light.  Sachs, of Delray Beach, has filed a bill to make texting while driving a primary offense, which she argues will make it easier to enforce. The penalties -- $30 for a first violation -- will remain. At a press conference with AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson to announce her proposed changes, Sachs recited several somber statistics. We decided to fact-check this claim: ""In 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths."" There’s little doubt that texting is a danger in automobile safety. A 2006 study by David Strayer and Frank Drews at the University of Utah found that people are just as impaired when they drive and talk on a cell phone as they are when they drive intoxicated at the legal blood-alcohol limit of 0.08 percent. The report, which looked at talking on handheld or hands-free cell phones and not texting, concluded that using a cell phone while driving ""can be as profound as those associated with driving while drunk."" But is it true that in 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths? When we contacted Sachs’ office, her legislative chief of staff said the information came from an op-ed piece AutoNation’s Mike Jackson wrote for the Tampa Bay Times and from news articles about a study done by the Cohen Children’s Medical Center in Long Island, N.Y.  The statistic quoted by Sachs has appeared in various media outlets, including CBS and Newsday, but the study’s chief researcher, Dr. Andrew Adesman, said the media ""wrongly attributed"" the drinking-texting conclusions to his team’s studies, a bit of misinformation that has continued to spread. Adesman said his research team analyzed CDC data -- the 2011 ""Youth Risk Behavior Survey"" The study found that 45 percent of U.S. high school students 16 and up (46 percent of boys and 40 percent of girls) reported texting while driving during the previous 30 days. The study suggested that the number could actually be a lot higher, given that 75 percent of teens now have cell phones. The study, however, didn’t directly compare texting and drinking while driving, which makes Sachs’ conclusion questionable. The study found a ""subgroup"" of the students who admit to texting while driving also tended to be involved in other risky behaviors on the road, including not wearing a seatbelt, riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol and drinking and driving. These risk takers were also more likely to smoke marijuana, have unsafe sex and ""use indoor tanning devices.""  The correlation of all these factors makes it difficult to determine what is the ""leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths."" Indeed, certain aspects of the study didn’t provide much support for proponents of texting laws. Researchers found that while texting while driving was slightly less common in states that prohibit it, ""the reality is that millions of teens text while driving,"" Adesman said. The study didn’t consider the strength of the laws or penalties. Adesman did say there’s reason to be alarmed about the number of teens texting. ""Kids aren’t drinking on a regular basis on school days, but they are texting daily."" (The CDC reports that high school teens drive after drinking 2.4 times a month.)  Sachs said she wants to ""change the culture"" of texting while driving.  ""I think our culture has turned against alcohol and driving, so we want to say to kids, ‘you know it’s wrong to drink and drive’ and the same thing has to be said about texting."" Another problem for Sachs’ claim: The data isn’t perfect. The involvement of cell phones is still underreported in accidents, said Deb Trombley, senior program manager for transportation initiatives for the National Safety Council. ""One challenge is that there isn’t good data. Cell phone use isn’t being recorded on crash reports… It goes down as distracted driving.""  Jackson’s office said that he discovered the information about texting surpassing drunk driving as a cause of teen driving deaths from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website, but staff didn’t have any further details. NHTSA officials said the data they collect suggested the opposite of what Jackson and Sachs claimed. According to the agency, 12 percent of 2,105 teen-aged drivers ages 14 to 18 involved in fatal crashes in 2011 were distracted in some way; 24 percent of those distracted drivers were using a cell phone. By comparison, 20 percent (428) of 14 to 18-year-old drivers involved in a fatal crash in 2011 had some level of alcohol in their system, according to NHTSA. A driving distraction can be anything from adjusting the radio or putting on makeup to eating a burger behind the wheel. With teens, there are often a bunch of noisy friends in the car. Our ruling Sachs’ statistic -- that starting in 2011,  texting began surpassing alcohol as the leading contributing factor to teen driving deaths -- was based on a misinterpretation of a scientific study and information from NHTSA that could not be confirmed.

Barge’s count off a tad on school calendars, but message on mark
","A few flakes of snow on Georgia’s red clay is often welcomed by cheers from many schoolchildren. No school! But in some parts of Georgia, students are missing more than a handful of days each school year because of other factors. The school year is now 30 to 40 days shorter in six districts, says the man in charge of Georgia’s public schools. ""We have about six school districts that they’re in school 140 to 150 days this year,"" Georgia schools Superintendent John Barge said. ""Guys, that is significant. That’s over a month of instruction gone."" PolitiFact Georgia was curious whether Barge’s math was correct. Barge, a Republican, made the comments at Stockbridge City Hall during a forum on the much-debated Common Core education standards. The forum was organized by state Rep. Demetrius Douglas, D-Stockbridge. As superintendent, Barge has supported the national standards despite opposition from some Republican lawmakers and tea party and advocacy groups. The resistance could hurt Barge politically. He’s running for governor. Before taking office, Barge was critical of Common Core, and PolitiFact Georgia recently rated his position on the standards as a Half Flip. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported this summer that four districts had 150 or fewer days of classroom instruction. Were there as many as six now? The state of Georgia requires that schools offer between 810 and 990 hours a year in instructional time for students, depending on the grade level. Most Georgia school districts hold classes for 180 days. Matt Cardoza, the communications director for the state’s Education Department, sent us a spreadsheet with the number of days of instruction for each school district for the 2012-13 school year and the projected days of instruction for this year. The 2012-13 list showed there were four districts with 150 or fewer days of instruction. They were Chattooga County (144 days), Haralson County (147 days), Webster County (148 days) and Stewart County (150 days). Chattooga, Haralson and Webster are the only three counties that were projected to have fewer than 150 days of instruction. Stewart and Wilcox counties are projected to have 151 days of instruction this year. No metro Atlanta districts fell that far below 180 days of instruction. The school districts in Clayton, Cobb and Henry counties were projected to have 175 days of instruction this year. DeKalb and Fulton counties have scheduled 177 days of instruction. The districts serving the cities of Atlanta and Decatur, and Cherokee, Fayette and Gwinnett counties were scheduled to have 180 days of instruction. So why are some districts opening their doors for so many fewer days? Money, they say.   Some districts, such as Stewart, raised their property tax rate by four mills in one year, the AJC reported. The district adopted a four-day week to cope with budget cuts. Barge was a bit off on his numbers. There were not six school districts that had 150 or fewer days of classroom instruction during the last school year. The total was four. Three districts have scheduled fewer than 150 days of instruction while two plan 151 days of classroom instruction. Barge was close. And he did qualify his statement by saying ""about"" six districts have 150 or fewer days of instruction.

Obama says some can buy health insurance for cost of monthly cell phone bill
","As President Barack Obama has taken a lot of heat for healthcare.gov, the website where people can buy health insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, he has turned to his same talking points time and time again. In response to residents’ concerns that Obamacare isn’t affordable, Obama says: ""One study shows that through new options created by the Affordable Care Act, nearly 6 in 10 uninsured Americans will find that they can get covered for less than $100 a month. Think about that. Through the marketplaces you can get health insurance for what may be the equivalent of your cell phone bill. Or your cable bill. And that’s a good deal."" We got to wondering if he was right. If you had to choose one, is it more affordable to visit the doctor for your symptoms or punch them in on your WebMD mobile app? (We shouldn’t need to tell you which would be more effective for your health.) Cell phone bills Let’s start by pinpointing the easier number: the average monthly cell phone bill. J.D. Power, a consumer research company, released a study Oct. 17 saying the average individual phone bill is $79 per month, while a family’s runs about $149. There’s a lot of wiggle room in there. Obviously, smart phone bills are higher because of required data plans. Different carriers have different options for text messaging, data and minutes. That’s in the ballpark of what Obama was referencing. The White House sent us a 2012 Coupon Cabin study indicating that 46 percent of cell phone owners pay more than $100 per month. Average marketplace costs Now we’ll switch gears to the trickier subject. Are the health insurance plans offered on the marketplace in that same ballpark? The marketplaces offer consumers a number of different pricing options for plans. ""Unless you and I are both the same age with the same number of people in the household and the same income in the same county, we’re not going to get the same data back,"" said Elena Marks, a Rice University health policy professor. As an example, the New York Times recently reported that, under the new law, health insurance costs are going up in rural areas, where there aren't a lot of marketplaces competing for consumers and driving down costs. Due to the complexity of pricing and the tax credit system for the plans, it’s difficult to tabulate a straightforward average to pit against an average cell phone bill. But let’s see what coverage costs could look like for some people. There are different levels of plans: catastrophic (only for people under 30), bronze, silver and gold. As premiums get pricier, they have lower out-of-pocket maximums, which means when people get sick, the plan covers more of their expenses if they have a gold plan as opposed to a bronze. Aside from the different levels, consumers pay different amounts based on how their income compares to the poverty level. For example, an individual who earns annual income at the U.S. poverty line ($11,490 this year) or up to 400 percent of that could get a tax credit of hundreds of dollars toward a plan. The law specifies they’d be expected to pay 9.5 percent of their income on insurance. At 400 percent of the poverty level, that breaks down to a maximum monthly payment of $363.85. But many people would pay less than that. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation within the Department of Health and Human Services published a report the White House referred us to indicating that 56 percent of the marketplace-eligible uninsured could pay $100 or less for a plan in 2014. That’s based on the costs of the second-cheapest silver plan, which is the benchmark for tax credits stipulated in the law. The ASPE study makes sense, said Boston University health policy professor Alan Sager. Many of the people applying for Obamacare, who don't have insurance through their employers, tend to be lower income, which means they'd qualify for subsidies that could put their premiums under $100 per month. ""That'd really tend to favor the ASPE assertion,"" Sager said. Marks, another health policy expert, also referenced the study as a reliable average of premium costs. Because there’s a wide range of both insurance plans and phone bills, it’s not hard to see that an insurance plan could be cheaper month-to-month. However, that’s all assuming the plan holder doesn’t get sick. Health care isn’t all about affording the monthly premiums. When policyholders go to the doctor, they usually pay a fraction of the costs with deductibles and co-pays. The money consumers shell out at the doctor’s office doesn’t count as money they pay through the marketplaces, as Obama specified, but it’s easy to see how his audience could get tripped up by that distinction. The law does specify the maximum amount a policyholder would have to pay out in a given year: $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a family. Divide those figures by 12 and you get  $529.17 and $1,058.33, respectively. Clearly, those numbers are greater than what anyone should be paying toward a cell phone bill. Granted, most won’t come close to hitting their maximums unless they get sick, but the possibility’s there. Our ruling Obama said under the Affordable Care Act, some U.S. residents could get health insurance for the same price as a monthly cell phone bill. There’s a wide range of plan costs, many of which are comparable to phone bills, especially for those who qualify for tax credits. A credible study indicates that about 56 percent of marketplace-eligible people could pay $100 or less. Obama was particularly careful in his phrasing, citing that precise study.  Still, health insurance isn't the same thing as a cell phone bill. It's insurance, so people who get sick will face additional costs in the form of co-pays and deductibles. Policyholders who get sick could be shelling out thousands of dollars each year for health care, much more than any cell phone bill.  Overall, we rate Obama’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/oct/28/barack-obama/obama-says-some-can-buy-health-insurance-cost-mont/

Patrick Lynch says Deepwater Wind's Block Island project will only create six jobs
","
Deepwater Wind's proposed eight-turbine wind farm off Block Island has been both praised and lambasted on economic grounds. Attorney General Patrick Lynch has been one of the project's staunchest foes, citing a number of reasons. One of them: the promise of new jobs has been overblown.

""Deepwater's own testimony, at the PUC, after a seven-month hearing, publicly held at the forum that the governor chose, is they said they'll create six jobs,"" Lynch said during a June appearance on the ""Newsmakers"" television program when he was running for governor.

Lynch dropped out of the race July 15. We filed his statement while we focused on candidates who were still running in the primary. But we decided it was still interesting enough to examine now.

In general, PolitiFact doesn't check predictions. But we can check whether Deepwater itself said that only six jobs would be created.

When we asked for the source for that claim, the attorney general's office directed us to written answers to questions posed a year ago to Deepwater by the state Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, which carries out the policies of the PUC and is responsible for representing consumers during PUC hearings.

The key answer about jobs came from William Moore, CEO of Deepwater Wind. Here's a portion of the response:

"" . . . we anticipate that the Block Island Wind Farm will generate between 35 and 50 direct local construction period jobs, and possibly more if assembly operations are performed at Quonset, an option Deepwater Wind is currently investigating. Further, we estimate that post-construction, operation and maintenance of eight turbines making up the facility will require approximately 6 permanent full time equivalent jobs.""

So Deepwater is saying there will be six full-time positions to maintain the eight wind turbines. Lynch was correct.

But Lynch was also being too selective.

A state's economic health relies on temporary jobs as well, and it's misleading to ignore the benefits of temporary construction jobs. Deepwater -- which Lynch himself cites as a credible source when it comes to the ""6 jobs"" number -- is also promising at least 35 short-term construction jobs.

And that's only for the Block Island Wind Farm portion of the project, planned as the first phase. If the much larger project of 100 wind turbines is ultimately built, it would mean even more jobs, both long-term and construction jobs. Deepwater is predicting at least 600 jobs associated with building those turbines at Quonset Point and many more indirect jobs.

Our Truth-O-Meter can't predict the future, so we don't know if the jobs estimates being projected by either Lynch or Deepwater are correct, whether the wind farm will -- as some experts have predicted -- actually cost the state jobs by driving up the cost of electricity, or whether fossil fuel prices will someday make Rhode Islanders glad they invested in the small- or large-scale offshore wind farms.",/factchecks/2010/sep/17/patrick-lynch/patrick-lynch-says-deepwater-winds-block-island-pr/

Was MSNBC's Ed Schultz talking about Alan Grayson in Grayson's flashy new ad?
","
With friends like Oliver Stone, it's no surprise Alan Grayson is blitzing Central Florida airwaves with glitzy, Hollywood-style campaign ads.

Grayson, a Democrat considered vulnerable in his re-election campaign against former Florida House Speaker Dan Webster, is airing a series of ads called ""When They Lie."" The couple of ads we've seen are slightly different, but all follow a simple pattern.

The screen flashes black and white images of conservative figures like Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh and Anne Coulter. Then, MSNBC's Ed Schultz, looks directly into the camera and shouts, ""This guy is what it's all about."" Next the movie action music ramps up along with images from around the world, mixing in messages in black and white, like ""Vote Truth,"" ""Vote Grayson,"" or ""When They Lie,"" ""Vote Grayson.""

The ads certainly are different, but we wanted to check the one real line included, the quote from liberal commentator Ed Schultz. Viewers have been tricked before by splicing together snippets of television, and in this case, the rest of the images in the ad have almost nothing directly to do with Grayson. So we wondered if the impression the ad leaves -- that Schultz is talking specifically about Grayson -- matches reality.

Grayson, whom Democrats love because he's so blunt and Republicans hate because he's so blunt, took to the House floor Sept. 29, 2009, to detail what he called the Republicans' plan for health care. ""The Republicans' health care plan for America ... don't get sick,"" Grayson said, with a simple white poster board proclaiming the same message. ""That's what the Republicans have in mind for you, America.""

But, Grayson added, Republicans recognize that plan isn't foolproof and said the GOP had a backup plan.

""If you get sick, America, the Republican health care plan is die quickly,"" Grayson added. ""The Republicans want you to die quickly if you get sick.""

Conservative Republicans demanded an apology for the ""die quickly"" comment while liberal Democrats praised Grayson.

Among the chorus of praise: Schultz, one the country's more prominent liberal pundits.

On his Oct. 1, 2009, MSNBC show, Schultz interviewed Grayson about his comments and referred to Grayson as the ""new lefty hero on the block.""

Here's one exchange between the two, according to an transcript:

Schultz: Congressman, do you take anything back? I mean, are we going to see more of this?

Grayson: Absolutely not. The people who should be apologizing are the Republicans. They're the ones who should apologize for dragging us all through the mud here while we're just trying to improve health care in America. That's all we're trying to do.

Schultz: Now, the thing I liked about it is that you had charts. I mean, this was planned out. You must have known that this was going to kick up a lot of dust. Did you fire and fire for effect?

Grayson: Listen, Ed, we've got to get past this point where everything is stalled, where the Republicans are winning just through inertia. We have a majority. We have to use it. We have to change America. That's the promise that President Obama made. We have to keep it.

After nearly an eight-minute interview, Schultz wraps the segment up with his own take on Grayson, and the political impact of his comments.

""For all of the hooey and the prognostication that's going on out there about the midterms -- 'Oh, Grayson's doing this, he might hurt the Democrats in the midterms' -- the hell with that,"" Schultz said (about 7:55 in). ""This guy is what it's all about.""

The end of the full quote is the line in the Grayson ad -- Schultz is specifically talking about Grayson.

For the record, Grayson did apologize for his comments. Sarcastically.

Here was part of that apology. (Video here.)

""Well, I would like to apologize. I would like to apologize to the dead, and here's why. According to this study, 'Health Insurance and Mortality in U.S. Adults,' which was published two weeks ago, 44,789 Americans die every year because they have no health insurance. So I call upon the Democratic members of the House. I call upon the Republican members of the House. I call upon all of us to do our jobs for the sake of America, for the sake of those dying people and their families. I apologize to the dead and their families that we haven't voted sooner to end this holocaust in America.""

In his new Hollywood-style ad, Grayson uses a quote from a charged-up Schultz that suggests Grayson is ""what it's all about."" Grayson clips the full quote -- and omits the suggestion that some think Grayson's antics could hurt Democrats in the 2010 elections -- but Schultz is indeed talking about Grayson, according to transcript and video. We rate the claim True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/16/alan-grayson/was-msnbcs-ed-schultz-talking-about-alan-grayson-g/

Allen Boyd cost Sallie Mae employees their jobs with health care vote, Republicans claim
","
Republicans hoping to take back the U.S. House of Representatives have their sights set on North Florida Democrat Allen Boyd.

A ""Blue Dog"" Democrat and a seven-term congressman, Boyd faces a serious challenge this November from Republican funeral-home owner Steve Southerland. The St. Petersburg Times labeled Boyd one of the two most vulnerable incumbents in Florida, and the National Republican Congressional Committee has identified the race in Florida's 2nd Congressional District as one its top prospects.

The NRCC reserved a big chunk of fall television time in Tallahassee, and already is airing an ad criticizing Boyd for voting for the massive federal health care legislation.

The ad is called ""Allen Boyd sides with Nancy Pelosi,"" and says that the passage of the federal health care bill will cost Boyd's district 700 jobs.

""Our economy is hurting, but Allen Boyd sides with Nancy Pelosi and he's killing our jobs,"" the ad begins. ""When Allen Boyd voted for Obamacare, he voted to shut down a local facility that employs 700 people. 700 jobs lost because Allen Boyd sided with Nancy Pelosi.""

It's important to note that while this fact check -- that Boyd's vote on health care cost his district 700 jobs -- is about the federal health care legislation, it's not specifically about health care. The massive legislation tacked-on changes to how students receive loans to pay for college.

It's those changes to the student loan programs that cost North Florida 700 jobs, the NRCC is claiming.

We'll explain the whys and hows in a moment, but first a primer on the student loan changes adopted in the health care bill.

The student loan changes

Before the health care bill passed and was signed into law by President Barack Obama in March 2010, there were basically two kinds of college loan programs: the Federal Family Education Loan Program, in which private lenders make and secure loans to students and receive subsidies from the federal government; and the William D. Ford Direct Loan Program, in which the federal government directly loans to students.

The federal health care bill eliminated those subsidies to private lenders and shifted student lending to the government's Direct Loan program, which Obama believes is more efficient and cost-effective. The shift is expected to save $68 billion over the next 11 years, $36 billion of which would be used to expand Pell Grants, a federal program that helps low-income students pay for college. Other money, about $9 billion, will help pay for some of the additional health care costs.

Boyd voted against the original version of the health care bill to pass the House in November 2009 -- which included the student loan changes -- but voted for the final version that passed the House 220-211 and ultimately became law.

He said he decided to support the final version because he believed it met four key principles: It reduced health costs, increased access, ensured patient choice and did not add to the federal deficit.

""This bill is not perfect, but I believe it meets these four principles of responsible reform by providing the largest middle class tax credits for healthcare in our nation's history and preserving a patient’s ability to choose their own doctor,"" Boyd said in a release announcing his support.

The question for this fact check to address then comes down to those 700 jobs, how they were impacted by the health care bill, and what Boyd could have done to stop any job losses.

Saving Sallie Mae jobs

Boyd's 2nd Congressional District includes a student loan processing facility operated by Sallie Mae, the nation's largest private provider of student loans. The facility is located in Lynn Haven, just north of Panama City. It employs about 540 full-time workers, and had in the past hired about 160 temporary workers. The company did not hire those workers in 2010.

Sallie Mae officials said repeatedly that if the health care bill passed with changes to the student loan rules, all of the Bay County jobs could be in jeopardy.

Boyd initially appeared to side with Sallie Mae and its employees, visiting the Bay County facility in November 2009 after voting against the first version of the health care bill. He also voted against the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act (H.R. 3221) in the House, which attempted to accomplish the same changes to the student loan program.

""Sallie Mae is one of our most vibrant and reliable employers in North Florida,"" Boyd said in a Sallie Mae press release. ""I will continue working to protect these valuable jobs and preserving the current student lending infrastructure that has served our students and schools well for years.""

Boyd attempted to remove the student loan language from the health care bill, and offered an amendment to that effect in front of the Budget Committee on March 15, but the amendment failed 4-32, Congressional Quarterly reported. Boyd said switching to federal loans would result in the loss of thousands of jobs for employees in the student loan industry, but acknowledged he had not been able to reach a compromise with other Democrats, CQ reported. 
But on March 21, Boyd voted for the health care bill, which included the student loan changes. He said he believed he still thought it possible to save the Panama City Sallie Mae jobs.
 
""I am disappointed that the student loan issue is included in the health care bill,"" Boyd said in March. ""I have had many conversations with Sallie Mae, the Department of Education, and the White House, and I believe there are a number of steps we can take to prevent job losses at the Lynn Haven facility. I will continue working with Sallie Mae and Education Secretary (Arne) Duncan to ensure that this new process will not jeopardize the future of the hardworking people in Lynn Haven.""

A month later Sallie Mae announced it was closing its Bay County location. The company said it was going to cut about a third of its 8,600-employee nationwide workforce and reduce its physical locations from 25 to five to seven. ""We've been warning about the impact of this legislation, and this is a direct result of that,"" Sallie Mae spokesman Conwey Casillas told the Panama City News Herald.

Boyd issued a news release that same day saying he was working the Department of Education and the White House to help protect the Sallie Mae jobs, hoping the employees could transition to a different type of loan processing position. He later lobbied BP claims administrator Kenneth Feinberg to place workers from the closing facility in oil spill-related damage claim processing jobs. News reports suggest he is still searching for jobs for the Sallie Mae employees.

But not before the first round of layoffs -- affecting about 50 employees -- came in July.

The facility is expected to be shut down by the end of the year.

""The decision to close our Bay County facility is based on the fact that this is the location where the loan origination function was performed,"" said spokesman Conwey Casillas. ""Effective July 1, 2010, the Federal Family Education Loan Program, first enacted in 1965, was eliminated along with the role Sallie Mae and other private sector companies performed in the origination of federal student loans.""

Our ruling

In the ad, the National Republican Congressional Committee says ""700 jobs"" were lost because Allen Boyd voted for the federal health care bill.

In the strictest analysis, the NRCC is slightly off on both points. The company plans to lay off about 540 full-time employees. It also chose not to rehire about 160 temporary employees. Boyd's vote, meanwhile, wouldn't have changed the outcome of the legislation.

Still, the ad has some elements of truth. After voting against the first version of the health care bill, Boyd did vote for a final version that tacked on significant changes to the student loan program. Sallie Mae warned that those very changes could threaten the jobs at its Panama City facility, and one month after the health care bill passed, the company announced it was closing that facility.

But it was Sallie Mae's decision to eliminate the Panama City jobs, cutting those specific jobs wasn't mandated by Washington.

We are certain this will be an issue Boyd will confront over and over again between now and Nov. 2. And it's certainly complicated -- so much so that he might not be able to explain the nuance of his actions and what happened in 30-second commercials. Luckily, we have no such time or word limit. The fact is, the federal health care bill that passed in March contained massive changes to the health care system, as well as changes to how college students get student loans.

Boyd in the end liked the health care provisions and didn't like the changes to the student loan system. He tried to eliminate the student loan provisions through an amendment to the overall legislation, but failed. And there is no ""yes, except for that"" vote in Congress.

It's much more accurate, for instance, to say that the 700 jobs were lost because the health care bill passed. Boyd's vote didn't change the outcome of the legislation, it would have passed either way. And if you believe Sallie Mae, that means he wouldn't have been able to stop what's happening to Sallie Mae's Panama City-area employees. We rate the claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/16/national-republican-congressional-committee/allen-boyd-cost-sallie-mae-employees-their-jobs-he/
"['Wisconsin', 'Julie Lassa']","
Julie Lassa says she created a fraud hotline that has saved taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars
","
Democrat Julie Lassa says she wants to go to Congress to ""clean up Washington"" and argues she has a record of fighting wasteful government spending from her 12 years in the state Legislature. Lassa’s website invites visitors to save taxpayer dollars by calling the state fraud hotline with reports of abuse -- and touts her role in its creation.

Lassa, a Stevens Point Democrat, is running to succeed Democratic U.S. Rep. Dave Obey, elected to the northwest Wisconsin district in 1969. Lassa has been criticized by Republicans as a ""Madison insider."" Lassa brags about the hotline to tout her legislative accomplishments and  underscore her claim that she saves taxpayers money.

On the website, Lassa states: ""Julie’s Hotline has saved Wisconsin taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars.""

So, do her claims ring true?

Lassa can claim considerable credit for the hotline. She’s listed as an author of Senate Bill 86 -- along with nine other senators and 11 sponsors in the Assembly. Lassa’s name is first on the list of senators, which indicates she took the lead role in that chamber.

The other sponsors (and anyone else who voted for the bill) might have opinions about whether it is  ""Julie’s hotline."" We’ll chalk that up to political puffery but note she’s not the one answering the phone.

Now what about the money-saving claim?

The campaign said it could not provide a dollar breakdown on the hotline savings and referred us to a Legislative Audit Bureau report on the hotline issued in June.

The Fraud, Waste and Mismanagement Hotline (877-372-8317) was created in 2007 and began ringing in the office of the Legislative Audit Bureau in April 2008. A secure e-mail system was added a year later. In 2009, the hotline received 79 reports -- 53 of which came over the phone.  In all, the hotline fielded 154 calls between the time it was established and the end of 2009, according to the audit bureau.

Some of those calls prompted responses from state bureaucrats and lawmakers.

A June 24, 2010 report issued by State Auditor Janice Mueller’s office discusses the 79 reports made during 2009. Some didn’t pan out, many couldn’t be quantified.

The one that stirred the most action was about the thickness of concrete used in state road projects. That complaint said a contractor had falsified pavement thickness and smoothness measurements. A similar complaint had been filed in 2004 and investigated by the Department of Justice. That probe was closed in 2008 after the department found ""insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges,"" the audit bureau said. After the report came into the hotline, the audit bureau looked at whether the highway construction program had adequate monitoring safeguards. That led to two legislative hearings and further review from the auditor’s office.

Among the findings from the further review: The DOT hired consultants for work that could have been done for $1.2 million less by state workers. The consultants were hired because of a lack of staff.

Mueller said in an interview that the call to the hotline ""led to significant changes to the concrete program"" that will ensure roads last longer. But she said it wasn’t possible to put a dollar figure on the matter.

In any case, any savings from the changes will be in the future.

Another hotline call identified problems with overtime payments to state workers. One had his overtime cut from 500 to 60 hours after his bosses took a closer look at his work. Such scrutiny appears to have stemmed a trend of increasing overtime payments, Mueller said.

Again, however, it wasn’t possible to put a dollar figure on any savings.

So we have a two-part claim. One part is clear, the other part is less so.

Julie Lassa did lead the effort to create the hotline, which has generated calls that led to changes. For Lassa’s second statement to be accurate, the hotline needs to have saved taxpayers at least $200,000. There’s no accounting of the actual savings, so we’re left to connect the dots. 
It seems plausible that the changes in the highway concrete program could one day reach -- or exceed -- that level. The savings in overtime seem likely to be smaller, although still possibly substantial. Regardless, any savings from the calls to the hotline will come down the road.  We rate Lassa’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/16/julie-lassa/julie-lassa-says-she-created-fraud-hotline-has-sav/

Ron Klein says Allen West called Social Security a ""Ponzi scheme"" and wants to destroy it
","
What do you get when you mix a Democratic congressman facing a tough re-election battle, an outspoken Republican challenger famous for his rhetoric, and an NPR transcript of an interview with a journalist who recently found himself facing some heat for e-mail comments about conservatives?

Those are the ingredients for a disputed TV ad.

Here are the details:

Allen West, the Republican challenging Democratic Rep. Ron Klein in District 22, is known for his unique and often controversial soundbites. As Klein faces West for the second time in two years in the closely Democratic-Republican split South Florida district, he is trying to use West's words against him by portraying him as extreme.

In a Sept. 13, 2010, Klein TV ad, the announcer says:

""Allen West has extreme politcal views,'' and then quotes West speaking to a crowd saying: ""I'm just honored to be here today with all of my fellow right wing extremists."" (The ad doesn't state the location of that speech but the Klein campaign said it was from this July 2009 Broward County tea party event seen on YouTube.) The announcer then continues: ""Allen West called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. He said this country has got to get on sound footing by destroying it. And West said that Medicare can be cut. Those aren't our values. Allen West. Too extreme for South Florida.""

The text on the TV screen reads slightly differently in part from the voiceover: ""Allen West called Social Security a 'Ponzi scheme.' Allen West: said Social Security should be destroyed."" The text on the screen states that the source of those statements is NPR on Feb. 23, 2010.

In this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to explore: Did West call Social Security a ""Ponzi scheme"" and say ""this country has got to get on sound footing by destroying it?"" The district, which spans Broward and Palm Beach counties, has a heavy concentration of retirees so Social Security is a hot-button issue.

First we turned to the Klein campaign to ask for their documentation for the ad. Spokesperson Melissa Silverman e-mailed us a transcript of a Feb. 23 NPR interview between NPR Fresh Air host Terry Gross and David Weigel, then a reporter for the Washington Independent, an online news publication. The name of the Fresh Air episode was ""CPAC, the Tea Party and the Remaking of the Right."" Weigel had attended both the Conservative Political Action Conference that had been held about a week before in Washington, D.C., and the National Tea Party Convention, which was held about one month prior to his NPR interview.

Around minute 23 of the program, Gross asked:

""So is this a fair statement to make, that a lot of the Tea Partiers not only believe that taxes should be cut but that a lot of the programs that taxes pay for should be extremely cut or maybe even abolished, including Social Security and Medicaid, Medicare? ""

Here was Weigel's response:

""That's absolutely true. And they'll put in some caveats about programs that people have paid into for a long time. But, you know, I talked to Allen West, who's kind of the perfect Tea Party candidate. He's a lieutenant - sorry - retired lieutenant colonel. He left the armed services after firing a weapon close to the head of an Iraqi prisoner and getting disciplined for it.

""He ran for Congress in 2008. He talked like this and he lost. But he's running again, and he's raised more money than his opponent -- Congressman Ron Klein. And I talked to him at CPAC. He got on the CPAC bill and he said, yes, Social Security's a Ponzi scheme, it's the biggest Ponzi scheme, but I'm not going to get rid of it right away but I, you know, hint-hint, eventually this country's got to get on sound footing by destroying it.""

We tracked down Weigel and asked him about his comments about West on NPR. Weigel quit his job blogging for the Washington Post this summer after e-mails he wrote critical of conservatives surfaced. He now works for Slate, an online magazine owned by The Washington Post Company.

Weigel said he had spoken to West on various occasions in the past -- including at CPAC but also over the telephone. Weigel said he wasn't positive when and where he interviewed West about Social Security and said he doesn't believe he ever wrote an article or blog about West's comments on Social Security.

When Weigel spotted the ad, he said he called the Klein campaign to ask for their source of evidence. The answer: the transcript of his interview on NPR.

""I'm really confused as to why the campaign would do this,"" Weigel said. ""I think it's an interesting thing to pull to start looking for something. It's weird to quote a reporter's take on a conversation he had and portray it as a quote from the candidate.""

Weigel said his full statement about West wasn't a direct quote.

""I remember 'Ponzi scheme' because that is not a word everyone uses,'' he said. ""It's a word a lot of Republicans use. I was explaining what the conversation (with West) was about. I wasn't saying 'here was a direct quote about that guy.' To grab those two things and say those are quotes from him is kind of odd.""

Weigel said when he spoke to Silverman at Klein's campaign, she asked him if he stood by his reporting. He says he does.

""The only thing I can say is I phrased it that way and everyone was fine with it in February 2010. It definitely is what Allen was thinking,'' Weigel said. However, ""that's a weird thing for a campaign to do -- use a reporter paraphrasing something.""

Weigel said since the ad surfaced he looked through some old notes but couldn't find the Social Security conversation with West.

We found at least a few articles or blogs Weigel wrote that focused on or mentioned West. Weigel wrote an Aug. 24 profile of the West-Klein race for Slate that didn't mention Social Security with the subheadline: ""Florida's Allen West may be crazy, but so far this year, that hasn't hurt Republicans."" On his campaign blog, West criticized Weigel who ""had the delusional gall to declare me, well, crazy."" Weigel also wrote a short piece Feb. 19 on terrorism issues discussed at CPAC for the Washington Independent that mentioned West and a June 23 Right Now Washington Post blog on black Republicans. Neither mentioned West's views on Social Security. We also did a Nexis search for West and Social Security during the past five years and found no articles -- other than a discussion about Klein's ad -- in which West was quoted or paraphrased as stating Social Security is a Ponzi scheme or should be destroyed.

We told Silverman that Weigel said his comments during the NPR interview were not direct quotes but rather him recounting what West said. We asked if that was the campaign's only source of evidence and if they still stood by their ad and why. She wrote: ""The campaign stands behind this ad. It is an accurate reflection of Allen West's dangerous and extreme views on Social Security and Medicare.""

We asked West's campaign manager Josh Grodin whether West called Social Security a ""Ponzi scheme"" and made the comments about destroying it.

""I don't have time to go through every video,"" Grodin said in an interview Sept. 14. ""I think the onus is on the Klein campaign. .... I would have to go through dozens and dozens of videos.""

At PolitFact Florida, we agree that the onus to prove a claim is on the campaign or person making it, but we also do additional research.

Grodin asked us to send him Klein's documentation, so we sent him the NPR transcript.

""The Klein campaign is citing a claim by David Weigel. A guy who has lost all credibility and has no journalistic integrity whatsoever is making a claim? That's pathetic. There is nothing else to say about that.""

Again we asked Grodin, did West make the statements?

""Has Allen ever called Social Security a Ponzi scheme? I don't know,"" Grodin said. ""Has he ever said we need to get on the right footing by destroying it? No. That's ridiculous."" 
So Grodin denies the remark about destroying Social Security, but the campaign isn't confirming or denying the Ponzi scheme comment

On the issues section of West's website, he has a brief description about Social Security:

""The critical aspect of Social Security is that we must restore it to the independent trust fund account. Once the politicians moved it to the general operating account, they used it for their pork barrel spending spree. The fact that we are creating a jobless morass in America means there are less workers paying into the system. This is another reason why we need private sector growth, which in turn creates jobs, which will replenish the Social Security fund.""

So how does Klein's claim stack up?

The TV ad said West called Social Security a ""Ponzi scheme"" and said ""this country's got to get on sound footing by destroying it."" The Klein campaign relied on one source of evidence: an NPR transcript of an interview with a reporter who now says that his description of West was a paraphrase, not a quote -- though he does remember West using the phrase ""Ponzi scheme."" We don't think a reporter's description of what a candidate says can stand as the sole source for an attack ad, particularly when neither the reporter nor the Klein campaign can find anything he wrote about West's comments on Social Security. 
We couldn't find any proof that West said it, and we find Klein's proof insufficient. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2010/sep/15/ron-klein/klein-says-west-called-social-security-ponzi-schem/

John Kasich says Ohio is one of the most taxed states
","
Jobs and taxes are top issues in this year’s state and national elections, with politicians banging daily on related themes in speeches, news releases and campaign ads. Republican gubernatorial candidate John Kasich amplified his tax message recently with the claim that Ohioans pay more taxes than people in most other states.

While he frequently makes the statement on the campaign trail, the claim is the stinger in his latest campaign television ad that began airing statewide Aug. 22.

""You can’t raise taxes in Ohio. We are one of the highest taxed states in the country ... If you raise prices in the state you drive taxpayers away.""  

Kasich made similar claims Sept. 14 during the first gubernatorial debate with Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland, which makes the issue worth examining  now.

The statement, Kasich says, refers to an individual’s tax burden – the sum of state and local taxes, such as property taxes and local sales taxes, that an individual pays. And he specifically uses a ranking by the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, which regularly crunches state and local tax data.

The Tax Foundation ranks Ohio’s total tax burden seventh highest, according to its 2008 study, the most recent available. Among 50 states, seventh qualifies in our book as ""one of the highest.""

But the ranking deserves more discussion because of an ongoing debate among tax experts about how to best evaluate or measure the total tax burden.

The Tax Foundation first combines state and local tax collections, and makes projections, or estimates, for the year the study is completed. The Tax Foundation also considers taxes Ohioans may pay in other states, and vice versa. It then divides the state’s total tax collections by total personal income.

Translated: the average Ohioan pays about 10.4 percent of their income to state and local taxes compared to the national average of 9.7 percent. Ohio takes a hit in the Tax Foundation study because of its relatively high income tax rate.

Other tax experts, including those at the Federation of Tax Administrators, agree that combining state and local taxes and dividing that by total personal income offers a reasonable way to look at the burden. But these experts stick with the raw U.S. Census data without making any adjustments or projections.

Ohio has the 16th highest total tax burden -- all state and local taxes -- as a percentage of personal income, according to the Federation of Tax Administrators’ crunching of U.S. Census numbers. That ranking moves Ohio from the top quarter of highest taxed states to the top third, giving the state a bit more cover.

And even in its purest form, the Federation of Tax Administrators say, U.S. Census data can be misleading because not all taxes are ""tied to personal income and the scope neglects certain types of state economic activity."" You can read its analysis of measurement methods here.

The Ohio Tax Department likes to brag about another view of tax-burden numbers offered this year, also by the Federation of Tax Administrators, but one that only looks at state taxes. By that measure, Ohio has the 33th highest state tax burden as a percentage personal income. That means only 17 other states collected a lower percentage of taxes than Ohio. But beware: this ranking looks only at the taxes imposed by the state -- not those imposed by local authorities. So an equal comparison can’t be made to studies that examine both state and local taxes. Nonetheless, the ranking is instructive because it shows Ohio’s tax rating has improved since it began reducing personal income and business taxes in 2005. That year, Ohio ranked 28th in the study of the state-tax burden.

And there are other ways to slice and dice the figures. We ran a simple Google search, ""total tax burden by state per capita,"" and immediately found another ranking. This one, from Statemaster, uses U.S. census data and excludes federal and local taxes from its rankings, focusing only on state tax collections. It ranks Ohio as having the 27th heaviest tax burden.

So that brings us back to the nagging question: How should the tax burden be measured?

Ohio’s Education Tax Policy Institute, a think-tank that defends the state and is led by school districts to analyze tax data and influence policies, argues that the Tax Foundation’s attempts to look beyond the U.S. Census data dooms its study. The institute makes its case in a paper entitled, ""More Tax Foundation Nonsense!"" which is available on its Web site.

The Tax Foundation has battled back, offering lengthy rebuttals. Its argument, ""Wishful Thinking About Tax Burdens in Ohio,"" is available on the Tax Foundation Web site.

The problem for voters is that tax experts will be debating the issue long beyond the election, so PolitiFact Ohio wants to keep Kasich’s claim in the context of the governor’s race.
  
We think both are important points that help provide clarification about taxes in Ohio.

One thing about Kasich’s claim is clear: by one measure, it’s accurate. But how to best define tax burden is cloudier, and a look at other research shows that answers and rankings can vary wildly depending on which taxes are included, which data sets are employed and which projectons are applied.

For these reasons, we rate Kasich’s claim Half True.

GOP rival says Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco office rent is over-the-rainbow high and downright wicked
","
What do you do when you're a Republican running an uphill, some would say quixotic, campaign against Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi in historically liberal San Francisco?

Trailing badly in the polls, John Dennis appears to be trying to raise his profile via the viral campaign video route.

Dennis has introduced a Wizard of Oz-themed ad, with Pelosi, of course, cast in the role of the Wicked Witch of the West.

""I will save you from those evil Republicans,"" the Pelosi character cackles. ""But first, pay $18,000 a month for my downtown office.""

She then talks about running up the debt and summons her ""monkeys"" (sporting IRS tags) ""to make you pay for it all.""

Cue Dennis.

""Step back everyone,"" says Dennis, appearing in the frame. He pours a bucket of water (labeled ""Freedom"" -- we're not making this up) and melts the witch.

Hokey? You bet. But with 500,000 hits in its first few days online, we'd say, mission accomplished.

None of the actors is likely to get much Oscar buzz, but we're not here to review the ad's artistic merits.

We'll stick to a fact-check of the claim that taxpayers are on the hook for $18,000 a month for Pelosi's downtown San Francisco district office.

The rent for Pelosi's district office is actually $18,736 a month, as first reported in June 2010 in a Roll Call analysis of a database assembled by the Sunlight Foundation. Pelosi moved into the 3,075 square foot space in the new, 18-story federal building in downtown San Francisco in the fall of 2009. It was a significant upgrade, more than quadrupling the rent she paid for her previous district office, and is nearly double the next-highest rental paid by a member of the House.

According to the Roll Call analysis, the next highest monthly office rent, $10,600, belongs to Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., whose district office is in a federal building in Manhattan. Democratic Reps. Jose Serrano (Bronx, N.Y.), Doris Matsui (Sacramento) Stephen Lynch (Boston) and Diane Watson (Los Angeles) all pay $9,000 to $10,000 a month for district offices.

This rental data comes courtesy of Pelosi, who allowed the release of the House's quarterly Statement of Disbursements online for the first time in November 2009.

Drew Hammill, Pelosi's press secretary, said the decision to move last fall was justified because after 20 years, ""the old office was no longer able to meet the needs of San Franciscans in the existing space and the new office will expand office size by nearly a third, allowing better service for San Francisco constituents."" 
The office is more centrally located, Hammill said, allowing constituents better access via public transportation. 
Better security was also a priority, he said. 
""In the role as speaker of the House, the new federal building offers enhanced security features, a major factor in the decision to move offices,"" Hammill said. 
 ""This move did not come without additional expense,"" Hammill said. ""As every San Franciscan knows, the city is one of the most densely populated areas in the county and, of course, office space rents are among the highest, on average, in the country."" 
Hammill also noted that the rent is being paid back to the federal government, which owns the building, and that Pelosi pays the same cost per square foot as any other federal agency that is a tenant of the building.

By way of context, Roll Call reporter Paul Singer noted in his report that serving as speaker carries additional cost and that previous speakers have paid substantially more for their district offices than other nearby members of Congress.

One other piece of context is warranted. The expense for district office rent is paid out of set amount allotted to members called the Members' Representational Allowances (which typically range from about $1.4 million to $1.7 million for each office). Out of this account, members pay for their staff, travel, office rent, office art, flowers, bottles of water etc. The amount of the allowance varies based on factors such as the distance of a member's district to D.C. and the relative cost of office space in the member's home district. Pelosi's allowance is higher due to the travel distance to California and the high rents charged in San Francisco. In addition, because of the additional responsibilities, the speaker gets a higher allowance.

Members can decide for themselves how to spend their allowances. And Pelosi did not exceed hers. So one could argue that while Pelosi decided to prioritize spending for her office space, it didn't cost taxpayers any more, that she simply had less to spend on other things. Members can give back the unused part of their allowance, but in practice, very few ever do. They simply find other ways to spend it.

We're not going to weigh in on whether Pelosi's rent is justified. But the ad says the American public pays $18,000 a month for Pelosi's district office in downtown San Francisco, and its $18,736. We rate Dennis' ad corny, but True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/15/john-dennis/gop-rival-says-taxpayers-pay-18000month-nancy-pelo/
"['Georgia', 'Message Machine 2010', 'Republican Governors Association']","
Barnes and Obama ""sorry"", GOP says
","
Republicans criticize President Barack Obama for what they call ""apologizing"" for the United States' actions to countries across the globe.

Now they're trying to say that former Gov. Roy Barnes, who is running to reclaim his old seat, is like Obama because he's apologizing, too.

The Republican Governors Association makes the accusation in a recent TV commercial. 

""Our president has traveled the globe apologizing for America,"" the announcer says. ""Our former governor Roy Barnes is traveling the state apologizing for his first term in office.""

The ad concludes: ""Roy Barnes and Barack Obama need to know: Georgians don’t want apologies. They want results.""

Is Barnes an apologist like our president?

Republicans have been playing Six Degrees of Obama with Democrats for much of this midterm election season. They're betting that the closer they link their opposition to the unpopular president the better.

Barnes has tried to outmaneuver their attempts for months. In August, he ducked a fundraiser Obama held in Atlanta. Barnes' campaign manager said the former governor wasn't invited, a claim AJC PolitiFact Georgia ruled Pants On Fire.

As proof of the RGA's accusations, its spokesman Mike Schrimpf pointed us to the group's anti-Barnes website, http://roybama.com. It lists what the RGA considers to be apologies by Obama and Barnes.

First, a bit about Obama and apologies.

PolitiFact National published an item on similar accusations against the president in a book by former Massachusetts governor and 2008 presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

Romney said Obama ""has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally ...""

PolitiFact National reviewed seven Obama speeches cited by Romney and ran them by several experts with different points of view. They also looked at previous presidential apologies.

They found Romney's statement False.

One of the experts PolitiFact National consulted was Nile Gardiner, who co-wrote the list of Obama apologies cited by the http://roybama.com website.

Yet PolitiFact National found Romney's notion of what counts as an Obama apology, which aligns with Gardiner's viewpoint, to be invalid.

""If you think American presidents should never admit to any sort of error at any time, you might find yourself in philosophical agreement with Romney's criticisms. ... But in our review of his words, we came up short,"" the item concluded. ""Yes, there is criticism in some of his speeches, but it's typically leavened by praise for the United States and its ideals, and often he mentions other countries and how they have erred as well. There's not a full-throated, sincere apology in the bunch.""

So Obama is not apologizing for America. 

But what about Barnes? Is he apologizing for his first term in office?

The RGA cites three examples, all from videos Barnes' campaign posted on its YouTube page. We'll take them one at a time.

""Roy Apologizes""

This campaign video, targeted at teachers, is titled ""Roy Apologizes.""

""I apologize. But it was never my intent, and it is not my intent now, not to treasure teachers and learning,"" he says in the video. He adds that he didn't listen enough to teachers.

That's an apology.

""Providence""

In this TV commercial, which ran during the primaries, Barnes says that ""as governor, my heart was in the right place, but I didn’t listen or slow down to explain why I had to make some difficult decisions. For that, I apologize.""

Apology? Yes.

""Listening"" 

In this video released more than a year ago, Barnes says he has been driving across the state listening to Georgians.

He doesn't utter the word ""apology."" He doesn't say he's sorry, either. Instead, Barnes says he ""learned some lessons"" since he lost the 2002 gubernatorial election to Sonny Perdue.

Barnes says he needs to listen. ""Listening is not something I did too much of when I was a governor before. I tried to do too much, too fast. I’ve learned some lessons. I learned I should explain myself more,"" he says. 

Apology? This is a tougher call. Barnes acknowledges mistakes and says he is changing his ways. But he never outright says he is apologizing.

Overall, though, there's no doubt Barnes is giving a mea culpa. The Barnes campaign said that's what he's doing, and politicians need to look back and assess their actions more often.

""Growing up in Sunday school, Roy learned that if you feel you should apologize, you should,"" spokesman Emil Runge said.

And that can be a smart strategy, University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said.

Former President Bill Clinton used that approach when he lost his bid for re-election after his first term as governor of Arkansas. He spent much of his next campaign apologizing and reclaimed his seat.

So the RGA's analogy has some truth to it. Barnes is apologizing for his first term, and he's proud of it.

But that doesn't make him like Obama, since the president has not apologized for America's actions.

Chet Edwards says Republican challenger Bill Flores helped run a company that laid off over 3,000 workers, then paid millions to executives
","
Democratic U.S. Rep. Chet Edwards, seeking re-election against GOP hopeful Bill Flores, says that as a businessman Flores helped run a company that laid off several thousand workers and then paid off executives.

In a TV ad that debuted online Sept. 6, Edwards first notes Flores’ boast he’s helped build energy companies and has created over 500 jobs—a claim PolitiFact Texas is reviewing. In Edwards' ad, the narrator says: ""What (Flores) doesn’t say is that an oil company he helped run laid off over 3,000 workers and then paid off its top executives with millions.""

Ouch. Is that so?

Edwards’ campaign said in back-up materials for its ad that in May 1998, two oil-field services companies--Baker Hughes Incorporated and Western Atlas, which employed Flores as senior vice president and chief financial officer--announced plans to merge. In July 1998, Flores signed an amended merger agreement on behalf of Western Atlas that was approved by shareholders for the companies in August 1998. According to information later submitted by Flores to Gov. Rick Perry’s office, Flores had joined Western Atlas in August 1997 and after the merger assisted Baker Hughes with special projects through December 1998.

To support its layoff tally, the Democrat’s campaign refers to a July 19, 1999 Securities and Exchange Commission filing by Baker Hughes, which is based in Houston. ""Approximately 3,600 employees were terminated as of Dec. 31, 1998,"" the filing says. Edwards’ campaign says that the terminations occurred after the merger and while Flores still worked for the company.

Finally, Edwards’ campaign says, the same July 1999 SEC filing indicates that Baker Hughes reported spending $87.7 million related to the termination of employees whose ""responsibilities were deemed redundant"" and executives ""due to change in control provisions"" triggered by the merger. The filing says executives were paid $60.8 million in total.

In response to Edwards’ ad, Flores’ campaign issued a Sept. 7 ""fact sheet"" challenging the ad's message. In follow-up interviews, Flores told us he continued working for Western Atlas after the merger--even keeping his title of CFO--but was limited to working on the sale of Western Atlas's share of a joint venture that operated in parts of the former Soviet Union.

His big point: He did not work for Baker Hughes as a top-level executive and had no role in the layoffs or executive payments at issue.

Flores allowed, however, that before the merger he and other executives had expected about 170 terminations afterward due to ""redundancies"" in duties between top staff of the two companies. He said about 90 to 105 of the ultimately terminated workers--including Flores--were Western Atlas employees.

In separate moves that year, Flores said, Baker Hughes had already begun layoffs in response to a downturn in the world economy reflected in lower oil and gas prices and rig counts. He said Baker Hughes cut 700 workers in the second quarter of 1998, before the merger; another 2,000 because of industry conditions in the third quarter, and 700 to 800 additional employees in the fourth quarter, for a total of about 3,400. In an online search, we found a Houston Chronicle news report reflecting a similar count and interpretation.

Flores said Western Atlas had ended 1997 with more than 10,000 employees. ""To the best of my knowledge, virtually all  the Western Atlas employees remained with Western Atlas (after the merger) except the 100 or so deemed redundant,"" Flores said.

Flores' campaign forwarded sworn statements from several Western Atlas executives at the time including one from John Russell, who says he served as president and ceo of Western Atlas up to the merger and as president of Baker Hughes after that. After the merger, Russell's Sept. 8 statement says, Flores ""was relieved of his management authority; however, as is typical in many acquisitions and mergers, (he) was retained on (the Western Atlas) payroll through"" the end of the year.

Separately, we contacted Baker Hughes where spokesman Gary Flaharty said Flores ""was not in a role to affect employment levels at the combined company after the merger."" He said that despite the 3,000-plus layoffs, Baker Hughes Inc. ended the year with 32,200 employees, up from 31,600 in 1997, the year before the merger.

For outside perspective, we called Miguel Quinones, a management professor at the Southern Methodist University Cox School of Business. After reviewing one of the SEC filings by Baker Hughes and Edwards' TV spot, Quinones said: ""I do note that the positions eliminated cover all levels, including executives. I also don’t see how the layoffs can be blamed on Flores."" Quinones speculated the payments would have reflected contractual commitments tied to the merger, not actions taken by Flores personally.

To round out our exploration, we asked Edwards' campaign if it was fair to say Flores had no role in the Baker Hughes firings and payments to executives. Spokeswoman Megan Jacobs reminded us that Edwards' ad doesn't say Flores is to blame for either, only that Flores helped run a company that had over 3,000 layoffs and paid millions to its executives.

""The ad does not say the merger caused the layoffs,"" Jacobs said.

True--though Flores' campaign pointed out a Sept. 8 news article in the Cleburne Times-Review quoting Jacobs saying: ""It's pretty clear the layoffs were the results of the merger."" Jacobs then told us that's how it appears to Edwards.

Finally, Jacobs stressed a version of Flores' resume that Flores filed with the state in 2004 to steel their case that Flores helped run Baker Hughes. She noted that the page describing Flores' time at Western Atlas recaps the merger with Baker Hughes right before a sentence that begins: ""During his tenure, he reported to the President and CEO and maintained an open dialogue"" with the board chairman and members of the board of directors. The entry goes on to say ""his scope of authority included (i) mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, (ii) financings and capital market activities, (iii) investor and institutional relations, (iv) planning and budgeting, among other executive responsibilities...""

Flores told us that ""during his tenure"" refers to his time with Western Atlas, hence the reference to his contacts with the president, ceo and other highers-up.

All told, how does Edwards' statement settle out?

Undenied: Flores retained an executive title at Western Atlas in the same year its new parent company, Baker Hughes, laid off more than 3,000 employees and paid post-merger millions to executives. 
But do these facts prove Edwards' lynchpin statement that Flores ""helped run"" Baker Hughes?

Not so, documents and our interviews indicate. Instead, we're told that after his old company merged with Baker Hughes, Flores' duties were limited to a single small project before his departure less than six months later. We don't see significance in the Flores' resume snippet touted by Edwards.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Pundits', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Taxes', 'George Will']","
George Will says tax cuts for wealthy cost less over 10 years than stimulus did in one year
","Two of the most contentious fiscal policy disputes in Washington today have to do with the stimulus bill passed under President Barack Obama in 2009 and the soon-to-expire tax cuts passed under George W. Bush in 2001. During the Sep. 12, 2010, edition of This Week with Christiane Amanpour, conservative columnist George Will compared their relative pricetags.

""The president says we can't afford the tax cuts for the wealthy because that would add $700 billion to the deficit over 10 years, which is to say, over 10 years it would add less to the deficit than Obama added with the stimulus in one year,"" Will said.

We decided to see if he's right.

First, we'll look at whether the upper-income tax cuts cost $700 billion over 10 years, as Will said. The president's fiscal year 2011 budget categorizes three tax provisions as being targeted to upper-income Americans: expanding the 28 percent bracket and reinstating the 36 percent and 39.6 percent bracket; reinstating the personal exemption phaseout and limitation on itemized deductions for taxpayers with income over $250,000 (for married couples) and $200,000 (for single taxpayers); and imposing a 20 percent capital gains and dividend tax rate for those above those income thresholds.

According to the president's budget, ending these three tax breaks would reduce the deficit by more than $678 billion over 10 years. So the reverse -- continuing them -- should cost the government about $678 billion over the same time period. While other calculations have included other factors, we think it's reasonable for Will to use this figure from the president's own budget. And while Will is off a bit on the numbers -- saying $700 billion instead of the actual $678 billion -- the difference between the two figures doesn't undermine the comparison he's trying to make. So let's call this part of the statement accurate.

Now, how does the stimulus compare? The updated total cost, as determined by the Congressional Budget Office in August 2010, is $814 billion. (That's up from the initial estimate of $787 billion at the time the bill was passed.)

So Will's in the clear? Not really.

Just as the upper-income tax cuts are being charged against the budget over several years, so too is the stimulus, as different funding streams are spent and tax breaks exercised. The same CBO report attributed $180 billion in new spending and foregone tax revenues to the 2009 budget, followed by $392 billion in fiscal year 2010 and a cumulative $242 billion over the course of fiscal years 2011 to 2019. The report does not provide updated yearly breakdowns for the period 2011 to 2019, but CBO's analysis at the time the bill was passed showed that the measure would increase the deficit in each year between 2009 and 2015, before reducing the deficit starting in 2016.

So it's clear that the funds authorized by the law are not being charged in one year, as Will said, but rather over several years.

When we ran this by Will's camp, they e-mailed back that ""you have a good point.""

A final note: Some of our sources noted another difference that undermines the comparability between the tax cuts and the stimulus. The stimulus, whatever one thinks of it, is a one-time charge to the budget. By contrast, the upper-income tax cuts -- at least if most Republicans had their way -- would be permanent, and thus a continuing cost in perpetuity.

Because the stimulus is temporary, it adds ""only a small amount of interest on the debt in the long run, while permanent extension of the upper-income tax cuts would add a significant amount to the long-term fiscal problem,"" said James R. Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Ultimately, we feel that Will had a point worth making -- that the 10-year cost of the upper-income tax cuts was lower than the total cost of the stimulus. But he overplayed his hand by suggesting that Obama obligated more in one year than the tax-cut extensions would cost over 10. Hearing Will's formulation, we think a listener would be led to believe that the stimulus is vastly more expensive than the Bush tax cuts, when in fact it is not. We rate Will's claim Barely True.

Former Florida GOP chair apologizes to Obama on education speech
","
A year ago, we fact-checked a statement from the Republican Party of Florida that claimed President Barack Obama intended to indoctrinate school children with socialist ideology. The alleged vehicle: a back-to-school speech given to the nation's students.

Some of Obama's other political opponents echoed the charge, and principals across the country had to answer questions from parents about whether students were required to watch the speech.

This year, Obama gave a speech to schoolchildren on Sept. 14, 2010, with little controversy. Like last year, he spoke of the necessity of hard work and a good education.

But we were surprised by a dramatic change of position for Jim Greer, the former head of the Republican Party of Florida. Here's his statement from last year:

""As the father of four children, I am absolutely appalled that taxpayer dollars are being used to spread President Obama's socialist ideology. The idea that school children across our nation will be forced to watch the president justify his plans for government-run health care, banks and automobile companies, increasing taxes on those who create jobs, and racking up more debt than any other president, is not only infuriating, but goes against beliefs of the majority of Americans, while bypassing American parents through an invasive abuse of power.""

We fact-checked that at the time and rated it Pants on Fire. We found no evidence that Obama intended to address school children on public policy matters, much less socialism. All evidence pointed to a more generic speech on the importance of education, and that's what Obama delivered.

Greer's position has entirely changed since then, and in more ways than one. Greer lost his party chairmanship in January 2010, and state authorities arrested him in June on corruption charges, alleging that he used a secret contract to send party donations to a consulting firm he owned. Greer now faces six felony charges, including fraud and money laundering. (PolitiFact Florida has detailed a timeline on Greer's departure from the state party.) Meanwhile, Gov. Charlie Crist -- who picked Greer as party chairman after Crist became governor in 2006 -- left the Republican Party in April to run as an independent for U.S. Senate. The party supports Marco Rubio, a former state legislator and speaker of the House, in that race.

This year, to mark Obama's speech to students, Greer sent the following text message to Florida reporters:

""In the year since I issued a prepared statement regarding President Obama speaking to the nation’s school children, I have learned a great deal about the party I so deeply loved and served. Unfortunately, I found that many within the GOP have racist views and I apologize to the president for my opposition to his speech last year and my efforts to placate the extremists who dominate our party today. My children and I look forward to the president's speech.""

We called the Republican Party of Florida and asked them about Greer's statement, but they declined to comment. That could be because Greer earlier this year filed a lawsuit against the party for failing to pay him severance of $124,000, plus health care. Just this past weekend, party officials said they were contemplating their own lawsuit against Greer and Crist for misspending party funds.

So Greer is no longer head of the party and repudiates his own statements from a year ago.

Could Greer's new view on Obama's school speech be just another stick-in-the-eye to the people who kicked him out of his job? Sure.

Greer sent a letter to Crist last month asking for his campaign contributions back, because Greer said he needs the money to defend himself. In the letter, he blasted state party leaders, some by name, saying they  ""are simply liars, racists, and extremists ... the current bunch that are running the show will stop at nothing to cover for their own misdeeds.""

Whatever Greer's motivations, we very seldom see such a thorough change of position on over-the-top political rhetoric, much less an apology. To note that dramatic reversal, we put Greer on the Flip-O-Meter and rate his statement a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2010/sep/14/jim-greer/former-florida-gop-chair-apologizes-obama-educatio/

Alex Sink says Florida is last on two state employee measures
","
Voters don't often hear politicians in Florida declare ""We're No. 1!"" when it comes to state spending for certain programs. Usually they cite how poorly we rank. CFO Alex Sink, the Democrat running for governor, follows that pattern and puts Florida in last place on two measures on her campaign website.

""Compared to other states, Florida ranks last in the ratio of employees to residents: 118 per 10,000 compared to the national average of 216 employees per 10,000 residents. And Florida is dead last in the nation in state employee payroll expenditures per resident: $38 compared to the national average of $69 per resident.""

It doesn't get any worse than last so we wanted to check: Is Florida last in the ratio of employees to residents and in state payroll expenditures per resident?

We asked Sink campaign spokeswoman Kyra Jennings for the source of both claims. Jennings sent us the State Personnel System Annual Workforce Report 2008-09 from the state's Department of Management Services.

On Page 5 of the report we found these statements:

""In 2008, state governments nationwide had an average of 216 state workers per 10,000 in population. Florida had a ratio of 118 workers per 10,000 in population. In 2008, the state government national average was $69 in payroll expenditures per state resident. Florida’s ratio was $38 in payroll expenditures per state resident.""

A map on page 6 based on census data shows that Florida and Illinois were tied for the lowest number -- 118 full- and part-time workers per 10,000 in population. A map that only looked at full-time workers per 10,000 population showed Illinois the lowest at 97 followed by Florida at 103. (And you thought we only competed with Illinois for most corrupt politicians. A New York Times analysis showed Florida is ahead of Illinois by a few steps in that category when measuring convicted public officials from 1996-2007.) A map on page 8 clearly shows Florida is the lowest in payroll expenditures at $38 followed by Arizona at $40.

Lauren Engel, a spokeswoman at the Florida Department of Management Services, said that is the department's most recent published report. So that's a relatively current state report based on census data, pretty conclusive evidence of accuracy. We looked at DMS' previous report and found that in 2007-08 Florida had the same last-place rankings in both categories.

But while our task was to fact-check Sink's statements, we still wondered: Is she pointing out how few state employees we have because she wants to change that rank if she's elected? We can't get lower than ""dead last,"" so does she plan to move the state up in the rankings?

On Sink's website, she appeared to be critical about the fact that Florida came in last in these categories -- she italicized the word ""last"" and the phrase ""dead last."" Here is the full context of what she wrote:

""The face of Florida government is reflected by the efforts of its employees, whose contributions are intended to help people, businesses, communities, and overall quality of life. Compensating public employees fairly is essential, because without the ability to attract and retain well-trained and knowledgeable staff, Florida government cannot deliver the programs and services that citizens depend on. Florida already is not competitive in this area compared to other Florida industries and even other states. In fact, state government employees have not had a general pay raise in the past five years. In 2008, the average annual state employee salary of $38,839 was 4.5 percent below Florida's average wage for all industries. Compared to other states, Florida ranks last in the ratio of employees to residents: 118 per 10,000 compared to the national average of 216 employees per 10,000 residents. And Florida is dead last in the nation in state employee payroll expenditures per resident: $38 compared to the national average of $69 per resident. As Governor, Alex Sink will push to ensure that state employees are recognized for high performance by receiving fair and competitive compensation.""

We asked Jennings in an interview, would Sink add more state jobs?

""No but she wants to make sure state employees are recognized for high performance and receiving fair and competitive pay,'' she said. Jennings added that Sink wants to ""streamline middle management"" and we saw on her website that she stated ""As CFO, Alex recently launched an initiative to streamline middle management in the Department of Financial Services, with an estimated savings of $8 (million) to $10 million a year when fully implemented. As agency managers resign or retire, their positions will be reviewed for elimination and the agency structure re-engineered using existing staff to cut unnecessary management layers in government."" So now Sink is talking about reducing the number of jobs though attrition -- not adding them.

We asked Jennings for more clarity. She told us in an e-mail:

""The point of the statistics you're fact checking is to demonstrate how lean Florida government already is compared to other states. Alex Sink will bring stakeholders together and do a top to bottom assessment of state government and its workforce -- inviting innovative ideas about how we attract quality workers, reward effectiveness and continue to make government more efficient and productive for our citizens -- before setting specific goals on numbers of state employees.""

Or to put it more simply: Stay tuned. We don't think Sink has made clear yet how she will reach the goals of streamlining middle management and paying fair and competitive salaries if she is elected governor.

But for this Truth-O-Meter, our task was to evaluate whether Sink's statement was accurate that Florida ranks last in the ratio of employees to residents and in state employee payroll expenditures. Sink accurately quoted those rankings from the state's most-recent Department of Management Services report, although Florida tied Illinois on the number of employees per 10,000 residents -- putting both in last place. We rate this claim True. ",/factchecks/2010/sep/14/alex-sink/alex-sink-says-florida-last-two-state-employee-mea/

Ohio Democratic Party's charge that DeWine was Wall Street's ""lap dog"" doesn’t tell the whole story
","
The Democratic political playbook has a new page that is getting flipped to the most in 2010—running against Wall Street. Whenever possible this year Democratic candidates are linking their Republican opponents to one of the primary bogeymen for the country’s economic recession.

The Ohio Democratic Party uses this tactic in a web ad focused on former U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine, the Republican candidate for Ohio attorney general, even going so far as to call him a ""lap dog"" for Wall Street. The ODP attack rolls everything bad about Wall Street into one big ball evoking big banks, Wall Street villain and convicted swindler Bernie Madoff and predatory lenders.

The video says that while in Congress, DeWine ""took $1.9 million from big banks. DeWine supported legislation that helped Bernie Madoff make millions. He protected predatory lenders while families lost their homes.""

PolitiFact Ohio decided to dig into these claims that paint DeWine as a pawn of the Wall Street elite.

The most straightforward one is that DeWine took $1.9 million from ""big banks.""

ODP officials say it’s easy to get $1.9 million. Just add up DeWine’s career fundraising totals on Open secrets.org — the handy federal fundraising tracker from the independent Center for Responsive Politics — as well as more than $62,000 raised in the current AG’s race.

While the math checks out, you can get to the $1.9 million figure only by adding in money not only from commercial banks ($595,677) but also securities and investment firms ($726,375), miscellaneous financial institutions ($348,548) as well as finance and credit card companies ($237,750).

The ""big bank"" claim need a pretty big tent to fit all of the qualifying financial institutions in its shade.

Meanwhile, the ODP claim that DeWine ""helped Madoff make millions"" can be traced to three ""yes"" votes the Republican cast in 1995 for a bill known as the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

DeWine joined 48 Republicans and 20 Democrats in the Senate. The legislation raised the burden of proof lawyers in private practice would have to show in cases of corporate fraud.

That means that DeWine’s vote was ""helping Madoff make millions"" because it handcuffed private attorneys from pursuing claims as concerns surfaced ""as early as 1999"" that Madoff was operating a Ponzi scheme, the ODP argues in an e-mail.

Even if that’s true — and it’s certainly open to debate — the timing of the concerns about Madoff’s operation don’t square with the timeline as presented by the Ohio Democratic Party.

In a 477-page report issued in 2009, SEC Inspector General David Kotz found that substantive complaints against Madoff were filed as far back as 1992 — three years before DeWine voted to overhaul the law.

That reports states that a total of ""three examinations and two investigations"" were conducted by SEC officials but that ""a thorough and competent investigation or examination was never performed.""

Most incredibly, SEC officials even failed to take the most basic of steps to check up on Madoff. ""At no time did the SEC ever verify Madoff’s trading through an independent third-party, and in fact, never actually conducted a Ponzi scheme examination or investigation of Madoff,"" states Kotz’s report.

Madoff himself called it ""astonishing"" that the check wasn’t done. ""They never even looked at my stock records,"" he told Kotz for his report, according to a December 2009 story in the New York Daily News. ""It would have been easy for them to see. If you’re looking at a Ponzi scheme, it’s the first thing you do.""

Clearly, the overriding reason that Madoff went undetected for so long is because the federal officials supposed to watch over him dropped the ball again and again.

Is it possible that a private attorney could have brought forward an investigation that brought Madoff to justice if the law hadn’t been changed in 1995? Yes, it is possible, but it’s far from a sure thing, especially considering that the old law was in place for three years after initial concerns surfaced about Madoff.

Besides, the law change doesn’t seem to quite equal ""helping make Madoff money,"" even if you conclude he would have been caught earlier if the old law had been in place.

Lastly, the ODP accuses DeWine of helping ""to protect predatory lenders while families lost their homes.""

That charge references a pair of 2001 tabling votes that DeWine made during the debate over the Bankruptcy Reform Act, which never became law because the differences between the House and Senate versions were never reconciled.

At that time, DeWine, 48 other Republicans and 15 Democrats blocked an amendment requiring that credit card companies disclose more information to consumers and giving stiffer penalties for predatory lenders. The other amendment that DeWine tried unsuccessfully to table prevented predatory lenders who violated the Truth in Lending Act from filing for bankruptcy to dodge claims.

Those votes were at a time when the Ohio Democratic Party says ""families lost their homes"" in a reference to the foreclosure crisis that has walloped the state, including a record-high 89,053 foreclosure cases in 2009.

However, Ohio Supreme Court statistics on foreclosures show only 43,419 in 2001.

So while certainly some families were among those who lost their homes in 2001, the foreclosure numbers were about half the record-breaking foreclosure numbers that have hit the state in recent years with upwards of 80,000 a year since 2007. By then, DeWine wasn’t even a senator.

Add it up, and the scorecard for the Ohio Democratic Party is far from spotless.
  
We rate the Ohio Democratic Party’s claims as Barely True.

Ron Johnson ad says Sen. Russ Feingold has never held a job outside of politics
","
Republican Ron Johnson, an Oshkosh businessman, has cast himself as an outsider in his bid for U.S. Senate, branding Democratic incumbent Russ Feingold as a career politician. It’s a common approach for first-time candidates and may play well with voters fed up with Washington. 
But in a television ad that began airing Sept. 8, 2010, Johnson’s branding iron burned a little hotter. 
The ad features five unidentified people -- ordinary Wisconsin residents, according to the Johnson campaign -- all tossing a variety of criticisms toward Feingold, including this one: 
""Russ Feingold is a career politician,"" a woman says. ""Has not worked anywhere outside of politics."" 
Feingold himself has copped to the ""career politician"" charge, saying at the Milwaukee Press Club in August 2010 he had chosen public service as a career and was proud of it: ""I make no apologies for it."" But the second half of the statement is a new charge. 
Is it true, as Johnson claims, Feingold has never had a job outside of politics? 
Feingold, 57, won election to the state Senate in 1982 at age 29, and served there until 1992, when he was elected to the first of his three terms in the U.S. Senate. That’s 28 years as an elected official and, if you start at age 18, nearly three-quarters of his adult life. 
But Feingold also was an attorney in Madison from 1979 to 1985, according to his U.S. Senate biography. He worked three years as a lawyer after graduating from Harvard Law School and another three years after being elected to the state Senate. Feingold worked for the firms of Foley & Lardner and La Follette Sinykin, which merged in 2000 with the Milwaukee-based firm Godfrey & Kahn. 
Seems cut and dried, right? 
Johnson campaign spokeswoman Sara Sendek acknowledged Feingold worked for the firms but said both ""are involved in political work."" She went on to say Feingold’s time ""as a highly paid lawyer a quarter of a century ago hardly constitutes any sort of real world experience with a business or creating jobs."" 
However, Sendek could not provide any evidence to PolitiFact Wisconsin showing Feingold worked on political items at the firms. 
We couldn’t find any, either. 
According to the Feingold campaign, Feingold worked as an attorney on litigation and had business clients, a point supported by attorneys who worked at the two law firms at the time. 
Neither firm could produce records showing the type of work Feingold did. But retired Foley & Lardner attorney Michael Laskis said Feingold did business litigation. And, according to Rick Bliss, managing partner of Godfrey & Kahn, attorneys from that firm who were at the old LaFollette firm when Feingold was there said Feingold was a trial lawyer. 
In short, Feingold has spent most of his adult life in politics, and he embraces the idea of being a career politician. But Johnson says Feingold never did anything else -- a point the Feingold disputes to the point of asking the ad be taken down. We rate Johnson’s statement False.",/factchecks/2010/sep/14/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-ad-says-sen-russ-feingold-has-never-he/

David Axelrod says U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions called for going back to policies that caused economic collapse
","
White House adviser David Axelrod singled out a Texas congressman's comment in July--ages ago in Washington time--to suggest American voters will not rebuff ruling Democrats come November.

In an interview aired Sept. 8 on National Public Radio's Morning Edition, Axelrod said: ""Pete Sessions, the head of the Republican campaign committee, said a few weeks ago that their goal is to go back to the same exact policies that were in place before this president took office. Let's remember: Those were the policies that crashed the economy; we lost 4 million jobs in the last six months of the last administration, the middle class flat-lined for that decade, special interests ran wild. and these are the very policies that they want to return to."" 
Did U.S. Rep. Sessions champion a return to policies that battered the economy? We sought the skinny on both parts of Axelrod's slam of Sessions, focusing on what Sessions said and the policies at issue. 
The White House told us Axelrod was referring to a Sessions' comment on the July 18 edition of NBC's Meet the Press featuring Democratic and Republican leaders of U.S. House and Senate campaign committee including Sessions, the Dallas Republican who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is intent on Republicans capturing a House majority. 
According to a transcript of the show, host David Gregory said to Sessions: ""This has been a debate so far this morning about, you know, the relative merits of Republican rule during the (George W.) Bush years and what this president (Barack Obama) has or has not accomplished so far. I think what a lot of people want to know is if Republicans do get back into power, what are they going to do?"" 
Sessions replied that the country needs to live within its means and lawmakers need to read legislation before acting on it. Gregory pressed for detail. Sessions said: ""We need to make sure that we allow employers, which was in that 52-page report that was presented to the president of the United States by CEOs in this country, we need to go back to the exact same agenda that is empowering the free enterprise system rather than diminish it."" 
After the program, spokeswoman Jennifer Crider of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee pounced, saying Sessions and another Republican on the show, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, ""hammered home that the Republican plan for the future is exactly the same Bush Administration plan that got us into the economic mess in the first place."" 
In response, Ken Spain, the NRCC's spokesman, said Sessions was referring to a June 2010 report by the Business Roundtable criticizing Obama's policies as anti-business. Spain told us in an e-mail: ""The White House is deliberately mischaracterizing Chairman Sessions' remarks."" 
Sessions did not respond to our inquiries about what he said or meant by his comment. Meantime, when we asked the White House to elaborate on which policies Axelrod thinks Sessions called to restore, spokesman Matt Lehrich pointed us to news articles in The New York Times looking back at the roots of the economic crisis that resulted in congressional approval of a Wall Street rescue package in the fall of 2008. 
An Oct. 2, 2008 Times article, headlined ""Agency's '04 Rule Let Banks Pile Up New Debt,"" singles out an April 2004 vote by the Securities and Exchange Commission making it easier for huge Wall Street investment banks to take on more debt--a decision reversed during the 2008 crisis only after commission staff failed to review the banks' rapid accumulation of debt, instead trusting banks to protect themselves against debt-driven disaster. 
A Dec. 20, 2008 Times article, headlined ""White House Philosophy Stoked Mortgage Bonfire,"" says that many culprits were to blame for the economic crisis, including President Bush's ""belief that Americans do best when they own their own home with his conviction that markets do best when let alone,"" encouraging lax lending standards. 
The story says: ""As early as 2006, top advisers to Mr. Bush dismissed warnings from people inside and outside the White House that housing prices were inflated and that a foreclosure crisis was looming. And when the economy deteriorated, Mr. Bush and his team misdiagnosed the reasons and scope of the downturn; as recently as February, for example, Mr. Bush was still calling it a 'rough patch.' The result was a series of piecemeal policy prescriptions that lagged behind the escalating crisis."" 
The story quotes a Bush aide saying the president looked back and said: """"We absolutely wanted to increase homeownership. But we never wanted lenders to make bad decisions."" 
Interesting hindsights, but relevant to interpreting Sessions? Hard to tell. 
Next, we turned to the June report by the Business Roundtable, an association of chief executive officers of leading U.S. companies, to see if its text fits with Sessions' statement to NBC that we ""need to go back to the exact same agenda.""

Titled ""Policy Burdens Inhibiting Economic Growth,"" the report covers topics including energy, the environment, financial regulatory reform, taxes, trade and health care reform. Its executive summary identifies ""key regulatory issues that are impeding economic growth and job recovery,"" such as proposals mulled by the Obama administration to raise taxes on foreign earnings and enable unions to organize via secret-ballot elections. The report also raises concerns about the financial regulatory reform legislation which passed Congress in July largely in response to the economic crash. Among the new rules it objects to are those restricting the derivatives market and making it easier for shareholders to nominate directors to corporate boards. 
Notably, the Business Roundtable's position on those ideas fill less than three pages in the report, which over all advocates a traditional big-business agenda: reducing corporate tax rates, making permanent a research and development tax break; moving forward on pending trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea; reconsidering the moratorium on deep-water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico; and immigration reform that cleans up a backlog in legal hirings of Chinese and Indian employees. 
Finally, an online search shows that Sessions told a Dallas group this month that to juice the economy, he favors ending capital gains' taxes, permitting businesses to write off investments ""quickly on a permanent basis"" and reducing corporate income tax rate to 12.5 percent--proposals in step with traditional conservative GOP ideas, though not implicated in the 2008 crash. (Would that he'd been that precise on NBC.) 
And how does Axelrod’s statement hold up? Kind of like Sessions’ July statement, with both falling short of clarity about  what Sessions wants back. 
It's reasonable to speculate Sessions wants a return to relaxed oversight of the nation's finance sector. But there's not enough evidence to rate Axelrod's statement more than Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/14/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-says-us-rep-pete-sessions-called-goi/
