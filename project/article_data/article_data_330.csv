How many in North Carolina support medical marijuana?
","North Carolina lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow physicians to prescribe marijuana for some medical issues. North Carolina is among a minority of states that haven’t legalized any form of marijuana. A key state Senate committee recently gave preliminary approval to Senate Bill 711, which would allow cannabis as a treatment for cancer, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, PTSD and other comparable debilitating conditions. Ahead of the meeting, Democratic state Sen. Wiley Nickel claimed that most North Carolinians support medicinal marijuana. ""Even though over 75% of the state supports medical marijuana we still have an uphill battle for final passage in the Republican controlled Legislature,"" tweeted Nickel, who’s raising money to run for Congress. Is support for medicinal marijuana really that high? Not consistently. Generally speaking, national polls show rising support for marijuana legalization. In 2018, PolitiFact reported that support for legal marijuana rose from 35% to 62% in only ten years. Gallup, which has been polling on the issue since 1969, found last year that a record high 68% of Americans support full legalization. And earlier this year, the Pew Research Center found that 91% of Americans believe marijuana should be legal in some form.  North Carolinians, meanwhile, haven’t been polled many times on whether medical marijuana should be legalized. While available polls show support for the issue, Nickel is slightly exaggerating their enthusiasm. In 2015, a Public Policy Polling poll found that 69% of 845 North Carolina registered voters supported marijuana for medicinal use. The margin of error was 3.4%. In 2017, an Elon University poll found that 80% of 506 North Carolina voters said in a live-caller telephone survey that they support the idea. The margin of error was 4.36%. In 2020, a Nexstar/Emerson College poll found that 73% of 717 registered voters approved of medical marijuana. The margin of error was 3.6%. In 2021, another Elon University poll found that 73% support among 1,455 North Carolinians who were polled in an online survey. The poll’s ""credibility interval"" was 2.7%. These numbers are high, but not consistently above 75% like Nickel said. Nickel’s office, for its part, cited a News & Observer story that described medical marijuana support in the state as being ""nearly"" 75%. David McLennan, a political science professor who runs the Meredith College Poll, says he’s skeptical that more than 75% of North Carolinians support medicinal marijuana.  ""Seems to me that North Carolinians generally favor medical marijuana being legalized,"" McLennan said. ""The support—at least as indicated by the four polls—suggests that support is pretty consistent and does not appear to be growing."" Wiley Nickel said ""over 75% of the state supports medical marijuana."" Nickel is rounding up. Support for medical marijuana surpassed 75% in only one of the four polls we found dating back to 2015. That said, each of the four polls show support for medicinal marijuana around 70% or higher. So he’s not far off. His statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A394680>],/factchecks/2021/jul/14/wiley-nickel/how-many-north-carolina-support-medical-marijuana/

Officer who shot Ashli Babbitt wasn’t assigned to any Congress member’s security detail, police say
","There are plenty of questions still unanswered about the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. For some Republicans, that includes identifying who shot one person who stormed the Capitol that day. In a recent email to supporters, former President Donald Trump asked, ""Who shot Ashli Babbitt?"" Trump brought up the question again on July 11 during a discussion with Fox News’ ""Sunday Morning Futures"" host Maria Bartiromo. But this time, he had a theory. ""I will tell you they know who shot Ashli Babbitt. They're protecting that person,"" Trump said in the phone interview. ""I've heard, also, that it was the head of security for a certain high official — a Democrat — and we'll see, because it's going to come out. It's going to come out."" The comments set off a frenzy of social media posts, like this one shared on Facebook, that claim the high-ranking official the officer was assigned to was either Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer or House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The photo in the post shows a person in a suit wearing a face mask and holding a handgun in his right hand. By the background seen in the photo, he appears to be pictured in the House of Representatives. ""He shot Ashli Babbitt,"" the caption reads. ""Pelosi’s or Schumer’s personal bodyguard. Prove me wrong!"" We can’t prove if the person depicted shot Ashli Babbitt, because officials have not released the name of the officer who fired the shot. We also haven’t been able to confirm the identity of the person pictured. But Capitol Police told PolitiFact that the officer involved in Babbitt’s shooting was not serving as part of security detail for any member of Congress, Pelosi and Schumer included. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) An officer shot Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, as she attempted to climb through a barricaded door at the Capitol where glass was broken out near the House chamber.  The officer involved was placed on leave while Babbitt’s death was being investigated by D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department, which shares jurisdiction with the Capitol Police.  The investigation concluded in April, and the Justice Department announced that it would not be pursuing criminal charges against the officer involved. ""Officials examined video footage posted on social media, statements from the officer involved and other officers and witnesses to the events, physical evidence from the scene of the shooting, and the results of an autopsy,"" the department said in a statement. ""Based on that investigation, officials determined that there is insufficient evidence to support a criminal prosecution."" A Pelosi spokesperson declined to comment for this story, deferring to the Capitol Police statement. Schumer’s office did not respond to an email seeking comment. Because official sources have not identified the officer involved in the shooting, we cannot verify or debunk any names being thrown around on the internet. But claims that the officer worked for Schumer or Pelosi are contradicted by the Capitol Police. They say that the person who fired the shot was not assigned to any Congress member’s security detail. We rate this post False.

Jan. 6 defendants were armed with guns, other weapons, documents show
","President Donald Trump claimed on Fox News that there were no guns in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. During an on-air conversation with Trump on July 11, ""Sunday Morning Futures"" host Maria Bartiromo twice broached the topic of whether guns were present during the attack at the Capitol. ""They called it an armed insurrection, and yet no guns were seized,"" Bartiromo said before describing it as being among the ""misinformation"" spread about Trump’s presidency. Later, she repeated the assertion: ""They continue to call this an armed insurrection,"" Bartiromo said. ""And yet no guns were seized, Mr. President."" ""Right,"" Trump answered. ""There were no guns whatsoever.""  Trump went on to describe the events of Jan. 6 by saying that ""people with no guns walked down"" to the Capitol, that the building’s doors were open, and that there was a ""lovefest"" between the Capitol police and the insurrectionists. Court documents, video evidence and news coverage directly contradict this characterization.  Many of those involved in the attack were armed, and several had guns that police later seized. The event was far from a lovefest: Five people died, including a Capitol Police officer, and more than 140 officers were injured in the day’s events. Video evidence shows both police officers and rioters being injured in the brawls. Rioters called for hanging then-Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Damage to the Capitol is estimated at $1.5 million and included ransacked offices, broken windows and doors, broken and stolen photography equipment, ruined statues, murals and furniture. A pending security funding bill provides dollars to cover related expenses, including tightened security and trauma counseling. PolitiFact reviewed the case files of approximately 430 defendants who were arrested and charged for their actions at the Capitol. We found several defendants who police say were found to have brought firearms with them. Some were charged with having firearms on Capitol grounds, while others stashed them away while in Washington. They included: Lonnie Coffman of Alabama: Police found multiple firearms and weapons in Coffman’s possession. Coffman’s truck, which he had parked in the vicinity of the Capitol on the morning of Jan. 6, was packed with weaponry including a handgun, a rifle and a shotgun, each loaded, according to court documents. In addition, the truck held hundreds of rounds of ammunition, several large-capacity ammunition feeding devices, a crossbow with bolts, machetes, camouflage smoke devices, a stun gun and 11 Molotov cocktails. Court records and video surveillance footage show that Coffman, who had ties to militia groups, parked the vehicle near the Capitol at 9:15 a.m. that day. The documents say that after he got out of his pickup truck at 9:20 a.m., he joined a crowd of people who walked directly to the Capitol building.  He was detained later that evening as an unnamed woman was driving him back toward his truck. Police questioned Coffman and searched him, finding two more handguns on his person. None of the weapons were registered, documents state.  Guy Reffitt of Texas: Reffitt was charged with bringing a handgun onto Capitol grounds. Court documents showed that Reffitt, reported in court documents to be a member of the militia group Three Percenters, told his family he brought his gun with him and that he and others ""stormed the Capitol.""  Christopher Michael Alberts of Maryland: Alberts brought his handgun onto Capitol grounds. An officer saw that Alberts had a gun on his hip and alerted fellow officers. When Alberts tried to flee, officers detained him and recovered the loaded handgun along with a separate magazine. The total number of people who carried firearms with them that day may not ever be fully accounted for because the majority of those involved in the siege were not arrested on-site but were tracked down by law enforcement days, weeks and months later. It’s also worth noting that the definition of ""armed"" is not legally limited to guns — it refers to any weapon used for defense or offense and used as a means of protection. Other items used as weapons Jan. 6 included bats, crutches, flagpoles, skateboards, fire extinguishers and chemical sprays. We reached out to Trump’s team to ask for evidence behind his statements but did not hear back. We also reached out to Fox News for comment but did not get a response by deadline. Trump said there were ""no guns whatsoever"" at the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and that ""people with no guns"" walked down to the Capitol. Court records and news reports show that many insurrectionists were armed, and several were charged with having firearms on Capitol grounds or stashed nearby while in Washington D.C. In addition, rioters had weapons other than firearms and used them during the attack. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F1C800>],/factchecks/2021/jul/13/donald-trump/jan-6-defendants-were-armed-guns-other-weapons-doc/

Fact-checking Joe Biden on voter turnout in 2020
","During a high-profile address in Philadelphia on voting rights, President Joe Biden argued that Republican efforts to roll back voting access in some states was unjustified.  After all, Biden said, the rules in effect in 2020 produced record voter turnout. ""In 2020, more people voted in America than ever in the history of America, in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic,"" Biden said on July 13. The number of votes cast in 2020 did set a record for a presidential election, and it did so in the middle of a pandemic, as Biden said. More than 158 million people voted as mail ballots became more widely available in many states. However, Biden’s claim leaves out an important caveat. ""He is leaving out the context that the population grew,"" said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist who tracks voter turnout statistics at his website, the U.S. Elections Project. In fact, the increase in population has made new quadrennial records for votes cast the rule rather than the exception during the past 60 years. During the 15 presidential elections since 1960, the raw number of votes has fallen from election to election on only three occasions: from 1984 to 1988; from 1992 to 1996; and from 2008 to 2012.    What about as a percentage of the potential electorate, the metric that scholars say is the best indicator of turnout? In 2020, turnout was 66.8% of the voting-eligible population. That was higher than for any election since 1900, when it was 73.7%. That was before women, minorities and 18-year-olds were guaranteed the right to vote across the country, vastly expanding the eligible population.   In each of the 16 presidential elections between 1840 and 1900 — a period during which many states were added to the union — the turnout percentage exceeded what was seen in 2020. It peaked at 82.6% in 1876.  ""The electorate was just much smaller then,"" said Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz. Biden said, ""In 2020, more people voted in America than ever in the history of America, in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic."" Using the metric of raw votes, Biden is correct. More than 158 million Americans voted, more than ever before. But his comparison doesn’t account for population growth. As a percentage of the voting eligible population, the rate in 2020 was higher than in any election since 1900, during the period when the eligible electorate was much narrower, consisting predominantly of white men. The statement is accurate but needs additional context, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809732FC80>],/factchecks/2021/jul/13/joe-biden/fact-checking-joe-biden-voter-turnout-2020/

In the days since this fake CNN headline was published, Haiti has asked for U.S. troops to help stabilize the country in the wake of the killing.

There's no evidence these politicians were killed over their countries’ refusal of COVID-19 vaccines
","Days after Haiti President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated by a group of gunmen in an ambush at his home, conspiratorial posts spread online that claim his death, along with the deaths of other political leaders, came about because their countries ""refused"" the COVID-19 vaccines.  ""Three countries refused the COVID-19 vaccine. Now all three of their presidents have died unexpectedly,"" a meme, shared on Facebook, reads. ""Haiti - Jovenal Moïse was killed yesterday. Tanzania - John Magufuli died March 2021. Madagascar - Didier Ignace Ratsiraka died March 2021. Are you a ‘coincidence theorist’?"" text below the image says. There is no evidence that any of these leaders’ deaths were connected to their position on COVID-19 vaccines. Moïse was the only one assassinated, and experts say his death will likely further hinder the vaccine effort in Haiti, not help it. Meanwhile, Ratsiraka, former president of Madagascar who died in March, hadn’t been in power since 2002. Both he and Magufuli died with heart-related issues, according to news reports. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The death of Tanzania’s 61-year-old president, John Magufuli, was announced on March 17, 2021, by Samia Suluhu Hassan, who was the vice president at the time and is now president. Today as we lay to rest our beloved President Dr. John Pombe Joseph Magufuli; on behalf of the People of the United Republic of Tanzania and on my own behalf i would like to thank fellow Compatriots; National Leaders, Religious Leaders, Political Leaders, Diplomatic Community, pic.twitter.com/ZQjiZCd03W In a public address, Hassan said Magufuli died of a heart condition at a hospital in Dar es Salaam. He had not been seen in public for more than two weeks before his death. There is no evidence that he was murdered.  Magufuli, one of Africa’s most prominent COVID-19 skeptics, mocked the effectiveness of masks, banned COVID-19 testing, prohibited doctors from diagnosing, and announced in June 2020 that the country had defeated the pandemic through prayer. Doctors were barred from wearing face masks, and some said they were forced to classify infections or deaths they believed to be from COVID-19 as pneumonia, heart disease or other illnesses.  Magufuli’s government refused to purchase any vaccines. He instead claimed the shots could be harmful and told Tanzanians, without evidence, that using steam inhalation and herbal medicines would fight off the disease. Hassan, meanwhile, has slowly taken a more serious approach to the pandemic. She’s worn masks in public, opened COVID-19 testing centers and announced in June 2021 that the country had ordered its first batch of vaccines. Ratsiraka was Madagascar's former head of state, and not its current president when he died at the age of 84 on March 28, 2021. His cause of death wasn’t immediately disclosed, but local media reported that his family said he died of cardiac arrest. Ratsiraka served as president of the island from 1975 to 1993, and again from 1997 to 2002. The announcement of his death was made on Twitter by the current president of Madagascar, Andry Rajoelina. ""The Malagasy have lost an illustrious patriot,"" Rajoelina wrote. ""I extend my condolences to his relatives, to the great family of the army and to all Malagasy citizens."" Along with his wife, Ratsiraka was admitted to the hospital days earlier for the flu, according to local reports, and had tested negative for COVID-19, his relatives said.  The country initially rejected the vaccines, touting an herbal remedy instead, before it signed up for the World Health Organization’s COVAX initiative in April. In May, it received its first batch of 250,000 doses of Covishield, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India.  There is no evidence that Ratsiraka was killed, and he was not serving as Madagascar’s president when he died.  Haitian President Moïse is the only one in this group who was assassinated. It happened when a group of gunmen entered his home July 7 and opened fire, killing him and injuring his wife. More than 20 people have been arrested in connection with the killing, most recently including Christian Emmanuel Sanon, a 63-year-old Haitian man living in South Florida. Sanon describes himself as a doctor despite records showing no medical license in the state, according to the Miami Herald. Others involved told Haitian officials that their mission wasn’t to kill Moïse, the Herald reported, but instead to serve a 2019 arrest warrant before installing Sanon as the new president.  The lack of COVID-19 vaccines in the country appears to be due to both the government’s hesitation to acquire doses, as well as administrative ineptitude.  A shipment of 130,000 doses, scheduled to arrive in mid-June, was delayed for unknown reasons and pushed to an undetermined date. Moïse’s killing appears unrelated to Haiti’s lack of vaccines. It followed months of rising political turmoil and gang violence in the country. Protests against Moïse grew in his last year of office when he declined to step down amid a dispute over when his term should end. He ruled by decree as the terms of elected officials across the country expired and no elections were held. Meanwhile, public health experts told the Washington Post that the assassination will hurt the troubled vaccine rollout, not help it. A Facebook post claims that the presidents of Haiti, Tanzania and Madagascar were all killed after their countries refused the COVID-19 vaccines. There is no evidence that any of the men were killed because of their countries reluctance over the COVID-19 vaccines.  Magufuli and Ratsiraka both reportedly died in hospitals of heart-related issues, and the latter had been out of power for nearly 20 years. Moïse was the only one assassinated among the group, following months of political turmoil in the country over his governing and rising crime.

It introduces a list of seven countries with these totals: Australia - 20,000 Canada - 45,288 Germany - 100,000 India - 96,000 Russia - 45,000 Spain - 20,000 United Kingdom - 112,853 United States - 460,000 ""Oh whoops, I meant children that have gone missing so far this year without a peep from the media,"" the post finished.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed. (Read more about PolitiFact’s partnership with Facebook.) The information displayed in this post is similar to the Global Missing Children’s Network data on missing children. However, there are a few problems with this framing of the data. The organization’s data was collected in 2015 — not 2021.  The bigger issue is that the Global Missing Children’s Network data refers to the number of children reported missing. The majority of children are not currently missing. We took a deeper look into statistics from the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. The network based its U.S. total on 2015 statistics for missing people under age 18 from the FBI’s National Crime Information Center. The number of entries in 2015 was 460,699.  Reports of missing children accounted for 72% of all missing-person reports. On the whole, all but 166 cases were removed from the database. Reasons for a removal include a law enforcement agency locating the subject, the individual returned home, or the agency determined the record to be invalid.   In 2020, the number of entries for children under 18 in 2020 was 365,348. Reports on missing children accounted for 67% of all missing-person reports. Overall, all but 2,146 cases were removed. Canada’s methods on reporting missing children are similar to the U.S. A 2015 fact sheet said the number of missing person subjects reported reflect a ""point in time."" In 2015, there were 45,288 reports of missing children. In 2015, 58% of missing children reports were cleared within 24 hours, while 91% were cleared within a week.  In 2020, the number of missing children reported in Canada was 31,948. A similar pattern unfolded, with 63% of reports removed within 24 hours, and 92% removed within a week.  For the United Kingdom in 2015, the number of missing children incidents was 122,321. The UK Missing Persons Bureau defines an incident as a single episode of a person being reported as missing to the police. The children were found in 49,501 incidents.   For the United Kingdom, most missing persons cases are resolved within two days of being reported, according to the UK Missing Persons Bureau. In 2019, the total number of reported missing children incidents in England and Wales was 65,800. Of those, 43% of missing children there returned home voluntarily, 24% were found by police, and 11% were found by family or guardians. The post attempts to draw attention to the number of missing children in major countries around the world, but there are a couple of issues with its data. One, these large numbers do not reflect data from 2021. Moreover, the numbers do not represent children who are currently missing but of children who were reported to be — which is a big difference, since most of the children were found. We rate this claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3CB900>],/factchecks/2021/jul/12/instagram-posts/social-media-post-conflates-reports-missing-childr/

No, vaccines do not cause sudden infant death syndrome
","A popular Instagram post falsely links vaccines to the deaths of babies, saying ""Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is ABSOLUTELY a side effect of vaccination."" The June 29 post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The image shows the word ""vaccination"" crossed out in red. The accompanying caption repeats the claim in other words, using a V-like symbol in place of the word ""vaccine."" Such tactics are often used to evade detection by fact-checkers. SIDS refers to the sudden and unexplained death of an apparently healthy baby. In the U.S., there were around 1,250 infant deaths attributed to SIDS in 2019, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People who are skeptical of vaccines claim that common childhood immunizations are responsible for SIDS and other health conditions, but scientists and public health experts have found no causal connection between routinely recommended vaccines and SIDS. There’s no known way to prevent SIDS (also called cot death or crib death), since its cause is unknown. However, many doctors and medical researchers believe that SIDS is associated with a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood and low levels of oxygen. Other research suggests that brain abnormalities may make some babies more vulnerable to SIDS. The Boston Children's Hospital advises that the risk of SIDS can be ""vastly"" reduced by avoiding smoking during pregnancy, putting infants to sleep on their backs and adapting their sleep environment. SIDS cases are most common during infants’ second and third months. That’s also a time when babies are getting many recommended vaccinations, which has led some people to associate the two and prompted researchers to look into possible connections. The U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, collects reports of adverse events, or suspected side effects, that occur after vaccination. It was developed as an early-warning system to help researchers detect patterns that may warrant further study. One analysis of VAERS data looked at 1,244 deaths of children reported  from 1997 to 2013, including 1,165 under age 1. There were 544 deaths attributed to SIDS where an autopsy report or death certificate was available, making it the most common cause of death. Among the children who died, those reports say, 79.4% received at least one vaccine on the same day. But VAERS data on their own cannot be used to establish whether an adverse event such as death is caused by a vaccine. VAERS is an open system, so anyone can file a report, and they don’t need to prove that the event was caused by the vaccine. The CDC, which runs the site along with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, warns that VAERS reports can be incomplete, inaccurate or unverified.  Infant deaths reported to VAERS have decreased since the 1990s, when the federal government and other groups launched ""Back to Sleep,"" a national campaign to educate caregivers and parents about reducing the risk of SIDS. In general, it is extremely rare for death to follow a vaccination. Vaccines are some of the most highly regulated and tested medical products used. And many studies and reviews have corroborated their safety.  Multiple research studies have concluded that no concerning patterns exist among VAERS-reported deaths that would point to vaccines as a cause. An analysis of SIDS cases reported to VAERS concluded that associations between infant vaccination and SIDS is ""coincidental and not causal."" The CDC recommends that during their first six months, infants receive immunization against diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough, polio, pneumococcal infections, rotavirus, Hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b, or Hib. Studies looking at each of these vaccines have found no associations between these vaccines and SIDS. (COVID-19 vaccines are currently not authorized for children under age 12.) Research shows that immunizations are actually associated with a lower risk of SIDS. ""There is ample and consistent evidence that vaccination following the CDC guidelines reduces the risk of SIDS by about 50%,"" said Dr. Guohua Li, a professor of epidemiology and anesthesiology at Columbia University, citing an analysis of nine vaccine studies. The DPT vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough alone can reduce the risk of SIDS by 10%, and the risk of SIDS has also been inversely correlated with immunization against polio.  ""In addition to providing vital protection against infectious diseases,"" Li said, ""infant immunization coverage contributes significantly to reducing SIDS."" An Instagram post claimed that SIDS ""is ABSOLUTELY a side effect of vaccination."" The causes of SIDS aren’t known.  Scientific studies and analyses have consistently shown that there is no causal relationship between vaccines and SIDS, and that receiving recommended immunizations can lower an infant’s risk of SIDS.  We rate this claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280966EB240>],/factchecks/2021/jul/12/instagram-posts/no-vaccines-do-not-cause-sudden-infant-death-syndr/

Social media post misrepresents preliminary data on miscarriages and COVID-19 vaccines
","The findings of a preliminary paper that evaluated how pregnant women were faring months after receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine are being misrepresented online. Alarming posts, like one shared on Instagram on July 6, state that 82% of women who got vaccinated early in their pregnancies experienced a miscarriage.  ""82% miscarriage rate among women who got the juice between 30 days and 20 weeks pregnant,"" its caption says. ""Don’t tell me ‘that’s not what the study says’ if you only read the abstract. Read all of it. Do some math. Draw your own conclusions from this, but share the info. Don’t tell me you did the math until you took out the 700 people out who got their first dose in the 3rd trimester.""   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This result is skewed because it doesn’t account for all the pregnancies being evaluated in the study, just ones that were considered completed at the time. The majority of participants are either still pregnant, or have not yet had follow-ups with the paper’s authors. While the preliminary results found no increased risk of miscarriage associated with COVID-19 vaccination, there is still a data deficit. Researchers acknowledge that available data on the topic remains limited and requires further research. The paper, titled ""Preliminary Findings of mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine Safety in Pregnant Persons,""  was published by the New England Journal of Medicine on June 17. It was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s v-safe COVID-19 Pregnancy Registry Team. The authors used data from pregnant women who received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines and submitted reports to three different federal reporting systems that monitor vaccine safety.  Researchers contacted 3,958 women, who had enrolled in the pregnancy registry, about three months after their vaccination. They found that 712 had given birth to healthy babies, 104 experienced miscarriages and one case resulted in a stillbirth. Induced abortion and ectopic pregnancy happened in 10 cases. The rest of the participants — over 3,100 — were either still pregnant or had not yet completed follow-ups with the authors. The results showed a miscarriage rate of 12.6% out of the 827 pregnancies evaluated, which is comparable with the average miscarriage rate of 10 - 20%. (Some experts believe this figure may be higher.)  The 12.6% miscarriage rate only reflects the completed pregnancies the authors knew about at the time of the paper’s publication. The catch, the claim’s proponents say, is that 700 of those 827 pregnant women received the vaccine when they were already in their third trimester, a point in pregnancy when fetuses are far more developed and miscarriage is less common. So, they changed the denominator by excluding those 700 to calculate a new miscarriage rate of about 82%. Other social media posts have put it as high as 84%.  Victoria Male, a professor in reproductive immunology at Imperial College in London, called the 84% ""meaningless."" ""The quoted rate of 84% is not the miscarriage rate,"" Male said in a series of tweets. ""It just tells us that we can't go from the first trimester to giving birth to a healthy baby in three months. Which I think we all knew, right?"" This @NEJM paper on the safety of #COVID19 #vaccines during #pregnancy found no increased risk of miscarriage associated with vaccination. So why is this person claiming that there was an 83% rate of miscarriage?Short answer, a maths mistake... 🧵https://t.co/VIYXSdGBDH pic.twitter.com/jjQywjn1zM The CDC’s Immunization Safety Office told PolitiFact that the paper was an initial analysis of the v-safe pregnancy registry data, and said the department debated the best way to present the number of miscarriages, which it describes as ""spontaneous abortions."" ""We felt it was important to report all spontaneous abortions that had been observed in the registry thus far. At the same time, we also wanted to limit the analysis to pregnancies for which we had final outcome data as there may be completed pregnancies we are not yet aware of because they have not had a scheduled follow-up call,"" the CDC said. In future reports, the CDC plans to limit its study to women who were vaccinated less than 20 weeks into their pregnancies and once their estimated delivery dates have passed. In analyzing limited data for women who received a vaccine up to 20 weeks into their pregnancies, the CDC found 27 miscarriages among 1,364 women, a rate of about 2%. But this is likely an underestimate because scientists don’t yet know whether all the remaining pregnancies were still ongoing.  An Instagram post claims that a scientific paper found an 82% miscarriage rate among women who got an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine between 30 days and 20 weeks pregnant. The Instagram post achieves the 82% figure by cherry-picking and manipulating data from a preliminary study. The post makes a conclusion based on a small sample of completed pregnancies known by researchers. The majority of study participants are either still pregnant, or have not yet had follow-ups with the paper’s authors. Early results have not found an increased risk of miscarriage associated with COVID-19 vaccination. But until more authoritative data is released, any statistic on this topic should be considered preliminary.  We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C06FA40>],/factchecks/2021/jul/09/facebook-posts/post-misrepresents-preliminary-data-miscarriages-a/

Missouri Secretary of State working to get the numbers correct
","Wisconsin’s presidential primary election on April 7 is serving as an example of what state politicians want to avoid for an election taking place during a pandemic.  Across the state there were fewer polling locations than normal. In Milwaukee, there were only five polling locations for a population of almost 600,000. This was concerning because fewer polling locations means more people had to come together to vote. The state was under a stay-at-home order to reduce the spread of COVID-19, and the governor has extended the order until at least May 26. Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft has called Wisconsin officials' handling of the situation ""ludicrous."" But it appears he has been inconsistent with the numbers he reports.  One week after the Wisconsin election, he went on St. Louis radio station 97.1 FM to talk about Missouri’s June 2 election. He said his state could handle things better and still keep in-person elections. He used Milwaukee as his prime example of how in-person voting went wrong in Wisconsin.  ""When you look at Wisconsin, in their largest city they normally have roughly 500 polling places, and when they just had their election a week or two ago they had five,"" Ashcroft said. ""That is ludicrous.""   It’s not the only time Ashcroft has changed the numbers.  What are the real numbers? Executive director of Milwaukee’s election commission, Neil Albrecht, confirmed that for a typical election the city has 180 polling places. In Wisconsin’s most recent election it was reduced to five polling places. The reduction in polling places was the result of fewer people volunteering to be poll workers. Fifty-two people across Wisconsin who had been at the polls on election day have tested positive for COVID-19. It can’t be confirmed, however, that they were exposed at the polls.  A little over a week after Ashcroft stated that Milwaukee typically has 500 polling places, he went on St. Louis Public Radio and gave the correct number, 180. In the same breath, however, he then reported that Milwaukee had reduced the number of polling places for the April 7 election to four, off from the five that were really available.  While a difference of one may not seem like a lot, the error going from five to four is 20%. The director of communications for the Secretary of State’s Office acknowledged that Ashcroft misspoke in both instances.   Ashcroft said that for the April 7 presidential primary, Milwaukee would ""normally have roughly 500 polling places. They just had their election a week ago, and they had five.""  He exaggerated the number of usual polling places by a lot, but he is correct about the number of reduced in-person locations.  His claim is partially accurate, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C06FE80>],/factchecks/2020/may/15/jay-ashcroft/missouri-secretary-state-working-get-numbers-corre/

She was with her parents when the attack happened.  The news outlet’s March 25 story says the girl was ""stabbed to death by a stranger."" A 30-year-old woman was arrested at the park on suspicion of murder and was ""detained at a secure facility under the Mental Health Act."" The Manchester Evening News reported that Jones died ""as a result of an incised wound of the neck.""  A witness chased after the alleged attacker and detained her until police arrived, according to Sky News.  On April 1, the Bolton Coroner’s Court opened an inquest into Jones’ death. Police coroner’s officer Rebecca Gardner told the court that Jones was playing on a scooter and rode past a wooden bench when she was stabbed by the woman sitting on it, the Bolton News reported. The inquest was adjourned until July 3 while police investigate the killing. The account of what happened to Jones has evolved on social media, though. An April 4 tweet, which was ""liked"" more than 33,000 times, calls the girl ""Emily Jones Bolton"" and says the ""media buried her story because her killer is a 30 year old Somali immigrant.""

Fact-checking why the US has more COVID-19 deaths than Canada
","A Facebook post claimed that a difference in leadership explains why the United States has so many more COVID-19 deaths than Canada. ""It’s not that there’s a virus shield between Canada (4,500 deaths) and the U.S. (80,000 deaths),"" the post said. ""What exists is a difference in leadership."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The United States has experienced more confirmed COVID-19 deaths than Canada. But when taking into account the larger population of the U.S., the gap is not nearly as large as the post claims. While experts say leadership is one factor affecting coronavirus mortality, other factors are in play as well. The raw numbers come from Our World in Data. That research organization is funded by philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates and is led by Max Roser, director of the Oxford Martin Programme on Global Development at the University of Oxford. As of May 9, the date of the post, the confirmed COVID-19 death toll was 4,569 for Canada and 77,180 for the U.S., or nearly 17 times as many. But the United States has a much larger population. To account for that, Our World in Data also reports the number of COVID-19 deaths per million people as of May 9: 121.06 for Canada and 233.17 for the United States. So adjusted for population, the U.S. death toll is not quite double Canada’s. The U.S. leads the world in overall COVID-19 deaths. On a per-capita basis, it fares better than some countries, but worse than others. The U.S. is showing a lower number of deaths per capita than countries such as Spain and Italy. But despite claims by President Donald Trump, it has far more than Germany and many other countries, including Canada, South Korea, Iran, Russia, Poland and Switzerland. But comparing numbers at a particular point in time ""can be very misleading in terms of conclusions — because trajectories over time and the levels at different points in time are very different,"" said health economist Peter Berman, director of the School of Population and Public Health at the University of British Columbia and adjunct professor in global health at Harvard University.  ""Canada and the U.S. are not too far apart today, but the U.S. was way higher than Canada some weeks ago,"" he said. The post does not define what it means by ""leadership,"" but there are differences in the ways the two countries’ governments responded to the outbreak. At the federal level, Canada supported widespread testing early and the U.S. did not, said Joshua Michaud, associate director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""That has been one of the big weaknesses of the U.S. response. It took us a very long time to scale up testing in the United States. ""Provinces in Canada have generally coordinated well with the federal government on how to respond to the outbreak, whereas U.S. states have often taken their own paths and sometimes clashed with the federal government,"" said Michaud, a former infectious-disease epidemiologist. ""That has not helped the response in the United States, if you have that sort of tension."" Berman said public-health officers in Canada are much more empowered legally, and medical care is largely under the same government authority as public health, so it is much easier to direct and coordinate a response.  Canada’s politicians, he said, ""tended to cede the podium to the public-health scientists more and didn’t undermine or question them, especially in public. In the U.S., political leaders disagreed with scientists often and publicly. With the U.S. in an election cycle, Berman added, ""political opposition is looking for things to criticize, as is a politically polarized media. Also, the U.S. seems to me to be a more polarized society politically. All of this has different results in terms of coherence and coordination of policy response."" News reports have also looked at differences in leadership. An analysis by the CBC, the Canadian broadcast network, said Trump gave mixed messages about social distancing, and one American study found that people in counties that voted predominantly for Trump in 2016 were less likely to perceive risk associated with coronavirus, seek information or practice physical distancing, the analysis noted. In contrast, according to the analysis, Canadian politicians were more consistent in their messaging, and tracking data collected by Google from smartphones suggested that Canadians practiced more physical distancing than Americans and began doing it earlier.  In addition to citing Trump’s mixed messaging, the CBC analysis said the U.S. death rate is higher because its largest city, New York, was struck early in the pandemic; and because a lack of health insurance is a problem in the U.S., especially among Americans more vulnerable to COVID-19, such as African Americans. ""Canada has universal health care, whereas many people in the United States do not have health insurance or easy access to care, Michaud said. And, he said, the U.S. has a ""fractured"" health care system, with government providers, health insurance companies and private practitioners ""competing for scarce resources."" A Facebook post claimed: ""It’s not that there’s a virus shield between Canada (4,500 deaths) and the U.S. (80,000 deaths). What exists, is a difference in leadership."" These numbers aren’t directly comparable because the U.S. has a far larger population, so the post exaggerates the difference.  But on a per-capita basis, the United States still has nearly twice as many COVID-19 deaths as Canada does.  Experts said differences in how political leadership responded to the disease are one factor in the disparity. But there are others, such as the virus’ heavy impact on New York City; poor access to health insurance and health care among people more vulnerable to the coronavirus; and people’s different responses to guidelines aimed at containing the virus.

Stacey Abrams gets Georgia’s reopening COVID-19 trend upside down. Cases fell
","Stacey Abrams has often come up as a potential running mate for presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The Georgia Democrat nearly won the 2018 governor’s race. In an interview with Mother Jones, Abrams said if she were in the governor’s mansion today, she would have handled the COVID-19 crisis totally differently. ""I wouldn’t have led Georgia to be one of the last states to shut down, and we certainly wouldn’t have been one of the first to reopen,"" Abrams said in a May 7 interview. ""Since the reopening of the state, we’ve seen our COVID rate skyrocket by 40%."" Abrams’ statistic is wrong. Abrams spokesman Seth Bringman said she relied on a post that briefly appeared on Forbes.com. The post was withdrawn. Virus testing in Georgia, drawn from the Covid Testing Project data, shows there was a smaller increase in the number of new cases in the period after Gov. Brian Kemp relaxed restrictions than in a similar period before the change. Under Kemp, Georgia was one of the first states to reopen businesses. Between April 24 and April 27, restaurants, gyms, beauty parlors and a number of other kinds of businesses began to welcome customers, so long as they followed rules to keep patrons separated and took other measures to prevent infection. In the 12 days before April 24, when Kemp began easing restrictions, Georgia had a total of 9,695 confirmed coronavirus cases. In the 12 days after (which coincides with Abrams’ interview), Georgia reported about 1,100 fewer confirmed cases, 8,549. Overall, comparing the two time periods, cases in Georgia decreased 12% after the reopening. They didn’t increase 40%. Bringman said no one has firm numbers in Georgia. ""The state is not producing accurate data, thus there is no way to know how many Georgians who have suffered,"" he said. The state has had problems, particularly in tracking deaths at long-term care facilities. But without good data, Abrams also wouldn’t have any basis to say cases rose 40%.  When she spoke, it was way too early to know if relaxing the rules on business had caused the disease to spread. It takes anywhere from three to 14 days for an infection to take hold. And after that, more days before a person feels ill enough to see a doctor, get tested and get test results back. Boston University epidemiologist Eleanor Murray emphasized that the impact of reopening business life in Georgia won’t be clear for some time.  ""There could be up to a month or more delay between when a case is reported and when the infection was transmitted,"" Murray said. ""This makes it very difficult to say whether cases are from before or after opening, especially in the first few weeks."" Abrams said that after Georgia’s governor reopened certain business activities, the COVID-19 rate rose 40%. In reality, the period after reopening had 12% fewer cases. Even if the policy shift did cause infections to rise, it wouldn’t appear until several weeks later. Abrams spoke before that effect would show up in the data.

Evidence counters McConnell claim that Obama team left no pandemic ‘game plan’ for Trump
","Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell alleged that the Obama administration did not provide the Trump administration with any information about the threat of a possible pandemic during a May 11 Team Trump Facebook Live video discussion with Lara Trump.  ""They claim pandemics only happen once every 100 years, but what if that is no longer true? We want to be ready, early, for the next one. Because clearly, the Obama administration did not leave any kind of game plan for something like this,"" said McConnell.  This claim caught our attention because its definitive nature was directly at odds with the position of some former Obama administration officials, who immediately disputed it and started circulating on social media the link to such a plan.  We reached out to McConnell’s press team to ask for the basis of his statement. McConnell’s spokesperson David Popp said in an emailed response that ""this is a unique crisis and we are all adapting to the public health and economic challenges."" In terms of the pandemic’s economic impact, he said there was ""definitely no playbook there"" and instead credited McConnell with his work on the CARES act, a coronavirus relief bill passed by Congress. Soon after McConnell made his playbook comment, Ronald Klain, who was the White House Ebola response coordinator from October 2014 to February 2015, tweeted out a link to a document titled ""Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents.""  The document, originally unearthed in March by Politico, is a 69-page National Security Council guidebook developed in 2016 with the goal of assisting leaders ""in coordinating a complex U.S. Government response to a high-consequence emerging disease threat anywhere in the world."" It outlined questions to ask, who should be asked to get the answers and what key decisions should be made.   Nicole Lurie, another Obama administration official, confirmed to us the existence of the NSC pandemic playbook and also said similar documents were created for the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  ""To say there was no playbook was ridiculous,"" said Lurie, who served as the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS during both terms of the Obama administration.  The playbook lists types of infectious disease threats that could emerge. ""Novel coronaviruses"" were among pathogens flagged as having potential to cause heightened concern.  Lurie said that there were tabletop exercises, which included planning for a pandemic-like situation, during the transition between the Obama and Trump administrations. (The Trump administration also conducted an exercise — known as ""Crimson Contagion"" — in 2019.) Other Obama-era officials offered similar stories in interviews this week with CNN: ""They were extensively briefed, to the extent that they paid attention to these things during the transition,"" said Jeremy Konyndyk, who directed USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance. ""We absolutely did leave a plan. It was called a playbook,"" said Lisa Monaco, who was a former homeland security adviser to President Obama  The goal, she said, was to share the lessons learned during Ebola and Zika. Meanwhile, Peter Loge, who served as a senior adviser within Obama’s Food and Drug Administration, told KHN he remembered a very clear message from the HHS secretary regarding the presidential transition.   ""Our job was to set up the Trump political staff for success, and we took that mandate very seriously,"" said Loge. He and his colleagues wrote memos to inform the Trump staff about priority issues. ""But nobody called me and asked what I was doing in my job,"" said Loge.  However, the Trump administration has maintained that the coronavirus sneaked up on the U.S., and Trump himself has even said it was a ""very unforeseen thing.""  But, in a May 14 exchange with reporters on the White House lawn, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany acknowledged the existence of the Obama pandemic playbook, even holding it up to show the press. She also dismissed its usefulness.  ""The Obama-Biden plan that has been referenced was insufficient. It wasn’t going to work. What our administration did under the leadership of President Trump was do an entire 2018 pandemic preparedness report,"" said McEnany. Trump, who was standing nearby, agreed.    Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Obama administration did not leave behind a ""game plan"" for a pandemic.  That’s wrong.  Multiple Obama-era officials have said they left a 2016 ""pandemic playbook"" that detailed exact steps to take in the event of an infectious disease outbreak. The White House press secretary even held up the actual document on the White House lawn. There has been discussion in recent days as to whether the Obama plan was dated because it dealt with lessons learned from earlier outbreaks that may not apply to the current pandemic. Still, McConnell’s statement focused only on whether any such ""game plan"" existed, and ample evidence suggests it did.  We rate it Pants on Fire.  UPDATE, May 15, 2020: In a Fox News interview, McConnell acknowledged that he was incorrect in his assertion that the Obama administration didn’t leave behind any kind of ""game plan"" regarding a pandemic threat. ""I was wrong. They did leave behind a plan so I clearly made a mistake in that regard,"" McConnell said May 14.",[<zip object at 0x000002809724BEC0>],/factchecks/2020/may/14/mitch-mcconnell/evidence-counters-mcconnell-claim-obama-team-left-/

LaHood overstates Chicago’s share of Illinois COVID-19 cases
","Calling for restrictions under the state’s stay-at-home order to be relaxed in his west-central Illinois district, U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood claimed Chicago accounts for the vast majority of the state’s COVID-19 cases. ""Peoria is not like Chicago,"" LaHood told a CBS affiliate in Peoria. ""93% of the cases in the state of Illinois have come from Chicago … There has to be a tiered system, a more measured and a balanced approach."" LaHood, a Republican who represents Illinois’ 18th Congressional District, which includes Peoria, made those remarks May 1 after Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker acknowledged some regions may be ready to reopen sooner than others depending on when they pass their peak. While there’s no doubt major urban centers with large, concentrated populations have seen a higher number of confirmed positive cases, LaHood’s figure for Chicago — where about 20% of the state’s 12.7 million residents reside — seemed improbably high. On the day he made his claim, the number of cases in Chicago had reached 22,700, about 40% of the state’s 56,000 cases at the time, according to data from the Illinois Department of Public Health. Chicago’s share of the total hasn’t varied much in the days since, the same dataset shows. LaHood’s own Peoria County has seen just 148 positive cases. Debates over how and when to resume different kinds of business and other activities have raged across states as the nation continues to confront both a rising death toll and historic surges in unemployment. Pritzker has since released a plan to gradually reopen Illinois that divides the state into four regions. None of the counties LaHood represents are included in the same region as Chicago. Some businesses, such as restaurants, would not open anywhere until the end of June at the earliest under the plan. LaHood said it’s ""unrealistic"" for Downstate regions to wait that long. When we asked LaHood’s office for evidence of his claim, a spokesperson indicated LaHood was referencing an area that included Chicago and the northern part of the state. ""Northern or upstate IL and Chicago, as of last week, accounted for approximately 93% of the cases, and ‘Northern’ was inadvertently left out during the interview,"" a spokesman wrote in an email. Asked if LaHood misspoke when he cited Chicago instead of ""upstate"" or ""northern"" Illinois, we got no response. Had LaHood referred to counties in northern Illinois that include the Chicago metropolitan region, he would have found himself on much firmer ground. The vast majority of the state’s cases have occurred in Cook County and the five counties that surround it: DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will. Together, those six counties are home to about two-thirds of Illinois residents but accounted for 90% of the state’s COVID-19 cases as of May 13. It’s common for residents outside of the Chicagoland area to refer to the significantly larger and more populous northeastern region collectively as ""Chicago,"" according to state political experts. But they said the inaccuracy reinforces regional stereotypes. ""If you’re already disposed to think of things as us versus them, then that’s reinforcing that narrative,"" said Kent Redfield, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Illinois Springfield. ""But it’s not precise, it’s not accurate … If you’re referring to northeastern Illinois, then be specific about what you’re referring to."" Our ruling LaHood said 93% of COVID-19 cases in Illinois ""have come from Chicago."" Confirmed cases in Illinois’ largest city account for less than half of the state’s total cases, public health data show. That’s far from the figure LaHood cited during his TV appearance. LaHood’s spokesperson said he was referring to the northern region of the state more broadly, but experts told us that’s no excuse. We rate his claim False. FALSE — The statement is not accurate.

RNC video takes Biden, Obama, Wasserman Schultz out of context on mail-in voting
","A new video launched by the Republican National Committee suggests Democrats are pushing a ""radical plan to change our elections"" through widespread mail-in voting. ""This is a radical change from their past,"" the video says. As evidence, it flashes to clips of comments by President Barack Obama, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder that are divorced from any context. The one-minute video plays snippets of journalists bashing Iowa Democrats over their bungled caucus in February before ending with a warning: ""Democrats couldn’t run the Iowa Caucus. Don’t let them redesign our entire election."" The RNC launched its Protect the Vote website May 8, vowing to fight the ""Democrats’ assault on the integrity of our elections."" But the clips of Democratic leaders are removed from the context of what they were talking about and ignore Obama’s support for voting by mail in general at the time.  The video also wrongly portrays the push for more mail-in voting as solely a Democratic effort. While Democratic leaders have pushed for more mail-in voting, they aren’t alone. Republican officeholders in at least 16 states that do not have all-mail elections were encouraging voters to cast ballots via mail. The RNC’s former chairman in March called for conservatives to embrace broader use of voting by mail. RELATED: Donald Trump’s dubious claim that 'thousands' are conspiring on mail-ballot fraud The ad starts with a clip of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden stating, ""We have an incredible opportunity to not just dig out of this crisis but to fundamentally change this country."" The text on the screen says, ""Democrats have a radical plan to change our elections."" But Biden’s statement was about protecting essential workers, not voting by mail or in person. He used a May 4 campaign event to talk about providing a livable wage and paid sick leave to workers including meat packers and grocery store clerks. Biden’s campaign has said he wants safer options for voting, including voting by mail and in-person voting. At a virtual fundraiser in April, Biden told donors that we have to make it easier for everyone to vote if we are still in lockdown, including providing mail-in ballots. At a virtual fundraiser May 8, Biden praised a move by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to send a mail-in ballot to every voter. The video shows MSNBC’s Chris Matthews asking Obama a question related to mail-in voting.  ""They are talking about people mailing in their ballots. Do you trust the security, the honesty of such an election process?"" Matthews asked. Obama responded: ""Well, I’d think we would have to figure out whether this was fraud-proof."" The video doesn’t clearly show the context of the interview; faint text on the screen says ""Decision 08.""  It would be possible for viewers to assume Obama was criticizing voting by mail in general, but Obama was commenting about a specific set of circumstances related to the presidential primary in Florida. In 2007, the Florida Legislature moved up the date of the presidential primary to Jan. 29, earlier than either national party permitted. Hillary Clinton beat Obama, but the Democratic National Committee determined that the election violated party rules and stripped the state of its delegates. In March 2008, some Florida Democrats proposed a do-over election including a scenario of entirely voting by mail.  Here was Matthews’ full question on March 11, 2008, to then-Sen. Obama: ""There’s word from Florida that they intend to put out a mailing sort of a campaign — I mean, an election process, whereby they make up for the primary they had before, which was ruled out of order by the Democratic National Committee and you did not campaign in. They’re talking about mailing it — people mailing in their ballots. Do you trust the security, the honesty of such an election process? The RNC video only included the first sentence of Obama’s cautious response. But Obama then made some positive statements about voting by mail: ""I mean, Oregon, for example, has a terrific mail-in system, but they’ve already scanned everybody’s signatures who’s registered to vote so that they can check to make sure that in fact the right people are voting. And that’s something that I think you’d have to figure out."" During the 2020 pandemic, Obama has not expressly called for only voting by mail. He called for safe voting options while tweeting a New York Times story that debunked the claim that absentee voting favors Democrats and an NPR story about proposals to expand voting by mail and early voting. The clip in the video of Wasserman Schultz does not clearly show the context. The text on the screen reads ""postal primary do-over"" — but it’s difficult to decipher. ""Debbie Wasserman Schultz argues a mail-in ballot has ‘wrong’ written all over it,"" a journalist says. The video then shows a clip of Wasserman Schultz, a Broward Democrat, stating: ""It would be a risky experiment for us with an election that has stakes as high as a presidential election does.""  The RNC video omits her next sentence: ""We've never done a mail-in ballot statewide."" She also said that ""there's a way to solve this without totally redoing this and causing more chaos."" Those clips are from a CNN report on March 10, 2008, about the idea for a mail-in primary do-over. Wasserman Schultz was talking about voting by mail in the narrow context of the proposed re-do election that spring. After months of wrangling that spring, the DNC agreed that Florida could send a full delegation to the convention, but each delegate would only get half a vote. Amid the pandemic, Wasserman Schultz said she supports expanding early voting and vote by mail options. The video also includes a quote by Eric Holder, a former Attorney General under Obama.  ""No form of electoral fraud ever has been or will ever be tolerated by this administration,"" Holder said. That stems from a speech he gave about voting rights in 2012; he wasn’t specifically talking about absentee ballot fraud.  An RNC video says Joe Biden said voting by mail is a way to ""fundamentally change this country,"" contradicting past statements by Barack Obama and Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The RNC video only includes snippets of statements by Obama and Wasserman Schultz to leave viewers with a misleading impression that they were bashing voting by mail in general, and that wasn’t the case. Obama and Wasserman Schultz were talking about voting by mail in a narrow set of circumstances: a controversial proposal to redo the presidential preference primary in Florida in 2008. There is no evidence that overall either Democrat was broadly critical of voting by mail as an option in elections. The portion of the video about Biden also omits context. The video quotes him stating ""we have an incredible opportunity to not just dig out of this crisis but to fundamentally change this country,"" before launching into the video’s theme that Democrats want to use mail-in balloting to ""radically change"" American elections. But Biden wasn’t talking about elections, he was talking about protecting workers amid the pandemic. This video includes actual quotes by these three Democrats, but lacks context to explain their remarks. This video rates Mostly False.

That class had insisted that socialism worked and that no one would be poor and no one would be rich, a great equalizer.""  The story ends with students slowly bringing the average down until ""to their great surprise, ALL FAILED and the professor told them that socialism would also ultimately fail.""

No evidence the Gates Foundation will profit from a coronavirus vaccine
","False claims about the Gates Foundation’s connection to the novel coronavirus know no borders. In a May 6 Facebook post, an alternative-health page and website called Revive Yourself claimed the philanthropic foundation of billionaires Bill and Melinda Gates stands to profit from the development of a COVID-19 vaccine in the United Kingdom. ""At £477 per vaccine, multiplied by 65 million people in the UK, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are on course to make just under £31,500,000,000 from Great Britain alone. Let that sink in,"" the page wrote. ""And people still ask who benefits from this virus & lock down?"" That’s $38.4 billion in American dollars, by the way. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The image in the post is a screenshot of a May 6 tweet from Ryan Martin, who runs Revive Yourself. The website publishes misleading claims about vaccines alongside recommendations for essential oils and supplements.  (Screenshot from Facebook) We’ve fact-checked several false and misleading claims about the Gates Foundation’s connection to the coronavirus pandemic — Martin even included one of the false claims in his Facebook post. So we wanted to take a closer look at the post, which he also published on his site. The Gates Foundation has pledged millions of dollars to companies developing potential novel coronavirus vaccines. There is no evidence that the Gates Foundation stands to profit from these efforts. The false claim has been widely shared in conspiratorial groups on Facebook. The assertion that the Gates Foundation stands to make money from a potential coronavirus vaccine originated on a website with a track record of publishing misinformation. We reached out to Martin for evidence to back up his Facebook post and blog entry. He sent us a YouTube video from Zed Phoenix, who describes himself as an ""investigative journalist, author and broadcaster."" In the video, which has more than 75,000 views, Phoenix makes the same claim about the Gates Foundation making money off a coronavirus vaccine. As evidence, Phoenix points to an article on BeforeItsNews.com, a website that has published false stories in the past. The story has been shared hundreds of times in Facebook groups for believers in conspiracies like QAnon, a broad right-wing conspiracy. The article claims without evidence that Gates ""reaps profits through Microsoft and his other companies"" from his philanthropic giving. The story makes several other false or misleading claims about the Gates Foundation, vaccines and the coronavirus pandemic — as does Martin’s Facebook post. ""The Facebook post contains a number of false claims about the Gates Foundation,"" the charity told us in an email. ""The foundation is not involved in the sale of vaccines in the United Kingdom, or anywhere else."" The basis for the £31.5 billion figure in the Facebook post comes from a March 17 Daily Mail story. The article includes an estimated cost of £477 per injection of a coronavirus vaccine that’s being developed by Moderna Inc., a U.S. biotechnology company. The newspaper attributes the estimate simply to ""analysts.""  The Before It’s News story got the £31.5 billion figure by multiplying £477 times the population of the U.K., which was estimated to be around 66.4 million in June 2019. We could not find the cost estimate reported in other publications, or on Moderna’s website. So we reached out to the company for more information about the estimated cost of its vaccine, which entered a clinical trial in mid-March. We haven’t heard back, but the company told Business Insider in March that it would not ""price this higher than other respiratory-virus vaccines."" Other pharmaceutical companies have offered similar statements. The Gates Foundation said in a Feb. 5 statement that it is investing up to $100 million for ""the global response to the 2019 novel coronavirus."" That includes up to $60 million to ""accelerate the discovery, development and testing of vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for 2019-nCoV,""  the scientific name for the novel coronavirus. There are 108 potential vaccines in development, according to the World Health Organization — at last eight of which are in clinical trials. The Gates Foundation is funding some of those efforts, but that doesn’t mean the philanthropy would share in future profits from a successful vaccine. RELATED: How close is a coronavirus vaccine? The Gates Foundation is a private nonprofit foundation that gets most of its money from contributions, specifically from the Gateses themselves through their family trust, according to the charity’s tax return. The trust’s most recent holdings report shows that it does not currently own stock in any of the companies that are working on coronavirus vaccines. Additionally, the Gates Foundation does not hold any patents related to the novel coronavirus. A Facebook post and several blog articles claim that the Gates Foundation could make more than £30 billion from a coronavirus vaccine. That number is based on multiplying a reported estimate of the cost of a potential COVID-19 vaccine times the population of the U.K. But the company developing the vaccine has not publicly released an estimate. And while the Gates Foundation has pledged millions of dollars to companies developing potential coronavirus vaccines, there is no evidence that it stands to profit from them. The Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2DF500>],/factchecks/2020/may/14/facebook-posts/no-evidence-gates-foundation-will-profit-coronavir/

No, U.S. isn’t expected to borrow heavily from China to pay for COVID-19 stimulus
","To finance its response to the coronavirus pandemic, will the United States borrow trillions of dollars from China?   That’s the claim of Kentucky Republican Rand Paul, the first senator known to have been stricken by COVID-19. On May 4, the U.S. Treasury announced plans to borrow $3 trillion during the second quarter of 2020, largely to cover three packages approved by Congress and President Donald Trump that contain more than $2 trillion worth of stimulus in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The third and largest package included one-time $1,200 payments to many Americans, temporary $600-per-week bonuses on unemployment checks, and loans and grants to small businesses. Two days after the Treasury announcement, Paul was asked on Fox News' ""America's Newsroom"" whether there will be a fourth stimulus. ""To people who ask me, I remind them that we have no money. We have no rainy day account, we have no savings account,"" he said. ""The $3 trillion that we've already passed out is imaginary money. It's being borrowed basically from China. So the irony is we got the virus from China, and now we're going to be more dependent by borrowing more money from China."" China, where the COVID-19 outbreak was first detected in December, is the second-largest foreign holder of U.S. debt. But experts told us there is no reason to believe it will be a large purchaser of the $3 trillion. To finance the government’s activities, the Treasury issues securities to various U.S. buyers (such as the Federal Reserve System, mutual funds, financial institutions and individual investors), to private investors overseas, and to the central banks of other countries, notably Japan and China. Because Congress suspended the ""debt ceiling"" for two years in 2019, the government can go into as much debt as it wishes, as long as there are takers for Treasury securities.  The total federal debt eclipsed $25 trillion on May 4, two days before Paul made his statement.  Of that $25 trillion, about $6 trillion is ""intragovernmental holdings"" — debt held by, for example, government trust funds, including the one that endows Social Security. The other $19 trillion is called public debt, which refers to all federal securities held by institutions and individuals outside the U.S. government, including individuals, corporations and foreign governments.  China buys U.S. Treasury bonds in public auctions, the same way other nations and investment companies do. The latest Treasury Department figures, as of April 15, show that Japan, along with Japanese companies and investment groups, was the largest foreign holder of U.S. debt, at $1.27 trillion. China was second, with $1.09 trillion. Asked for information to support Paul’s statement, a spokesman for the senator cited the amount of U.S. debt held by China and said foreign holdings account for about 39% of public debt. Asked to elaborate, he didn’t reply. Several experts told us that those figures do not support Paul’s claim and that there is no other evidence to back it, either. Most of the debt incurred so far to deal with the coronavirus has been purchased by the Federal Reserve, not foreign or domestic savers, said Joshua Gordon, senior policy adviser at the Concord Coalition, a group that advocates for fiscal responsibility. David Dollar, a senior fellow in the China Center at the Brookings Institution and a former U.S. Treasury emissary to China, told PolitiFact that China lacks funds and ""there is no reason to expect"" China’s holdings of U.S. debt to increase in 2020. ""In theory it could borrow dollars on the international market in order to buy Treasurys, but this does not make any sense, as it would pay more in interest on its borrowing than it earns on the Treasurys, which is basically zero these days,"" he said. China has been reducing its U.S. debt holdings in recent years as a result of having less foreign currency, said economist Derek Scissors, resident scholar specializing in China with the American Enterprise Institute.  ""We won’t be borrowing from China this year because China doesn’t have the money to lend us,"" he said. ""There probably isn’t enough global liquidity for most of the money to come from overseas. The largest portion is likely to come from U.S. institutions, which have few diversification options given economic contraction, and thus ultimately from American savers. The Fed itself may become the prime buyer."" Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told Newsweek the Fed is set to be the biggest source of Treasury demand this year ""and we think by a long shot."" China and other emerging market governments are selling their Treasury holdings to create dollars they can use to buy their own currencies, which are weak, he said. Barry Bosworth, a senior fellow in economic studies at Brookings, told PolitiFact ""there is no factual basis"" for Paul’s claim, ""since holdings of individual countries are only reported with a long lag. Most recently, new Treasury debt has been purchased by the Federal Reserve, and I expect that to continue.""  ""The Treasury issues securities in an open, very active market where investors, including other governments, are free to buy and sell as they wish,"" Bosworth added. ""We don’t know or care who are net purchasers. If investors are willing to buy U.S. securities at a time of chaos, it is good news."" Paul said $3 trillion for federal coronavirus stimulus packages is ""being borrowed basically from China."" Experts say that the Federal Reserve is likely to be a major source of funds for the $3 trillion and that China, with relatively little available funds, is expected to buy little if any of the debt.

The false TikTok claim that high unemployment is killing more people than the coronavirus
","A TikTok post is proof that a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. In the video, Steven Baker, an Idaho chiropractor and self-defined ""expert in healing,"" argued that the tens of thousands of deaths the country is witnessing don’t come from the coronavirus. They come from the shutdown. ""The economy is what’s killing people,"" Baker said in his April 23 video. ""Homicide, suicide, heart attacks, mental health institutions, alcoholism, drug use. That’s called deaths of despair."" Baker cited a stat that when unemployment goes up 1%, deaths of despair go up 58,000 over five years. And he noted that unemployment now is through the roof. At the end of his piece, he doubled down on his key point. ""It’s not the coronavirus that’s killing people. It is the economy. Way more people are dying because of the economy and unemployment than will ever be killed by coronavirus."" We reached Baker, and when we explained the underlying research to him, he acknowledged that the numbers didn’t add up. ""I admit, I was wrong,"" Baker said.  He said he heard the 58,000 figure from a reliable source, and added, ""this virus is a lot less dangerous than people think it is."" Since an extended economic downturn can cause some kinds of deaths to rise, and there are more and more warnings about that, it’s worth a moment to unpack what the real research shows. We’ll start with the researcher whose work, indirectly, lies behind Baker’s central argument. More than four decades ago, in a report for the congressional Joint Economic Committee, medical sociologist Harvey Brenner assessed the impact of sustained unemployment. Brenner found that in a five-year period, a 1.4% rise in unemployment added about 30,000 deaths due to suicides (1,540), homicides (1,740), liver disease (870) and cardiovascular/kidney disease (26,440). Factoring in America’s growing population, a recent opinion piece estimated the added deaths to be 58,000. That piece, citing Brenner, was the source of Baker’s claim.  But Brenner, now a professor at the University of North Texas, described how the video fundamentally misused his work. Brenner said his work is about ""the permanent loss of jobs,"" not an immediate rise in unemployment, no matter how dramatic. The deaths he identified started two years after a sustained economic downturn. ""It is not now statistically possible to render a verdict on the economy-based mortality implications of the immediate downturn of the past two months,"" Brenner said. ""Baker’s video is not factually correct."" Baker builds his entire case on Brenner’s findings. But over the decades, other researchers have cast doubt on Brenner’s core conclusion, some going so far as to say he got things upside down. There are deaths of despair, said Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton. They wrote a New York Times bestseller ""Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism."" The deaths primarily were among less educated white Americans and started in the 1990s. ""They rose before the Great Recession, they grew during the Great Recession and they grew after the Great Recession,"" Case and Deaton wrote in a recent op-ed. ""The line of rising deaths shows no perceptible effect of the collapse of the economy."" Case and Deaton point to Spain and Greece as the poster children of the beneficial effects of recession. ""Unemployment in Greece and Spain more than tripled, to the point where more than a quarter of the population was unemployed,"" they wrote. ""Yet Greece and Spain saw increases in life expectancy that were among the best in Europe."" As counterintuitive as it might sound, mortality from cardiovascular disease in the U.S. typically falls during a downturn, as Christopher Ruhm, a University of Virginia economist found. One study reported that in a lackluster economy, people exercise more and smoke less. That’s particularly telling, since heart related deaths were a huge factor in Brenner’s total. Ruhm cautions, though, that the tie between the economy and any given disease is complex and changeable. The reduction in heart disease deaths seen in decades past was not as strong in recent years and might give way further in the current crisis if fear of the virus keeps people from seeking treatment. Still, he called the statistics in Baker’s video ""silly."" Ruhm’s overarching warning is that the country is in new territory. ""The fundamental fact is that we can’t extrapolate from the recent past to understand the effects of the coronavirus,"" he said. ""The nature and magnitude of the effects are just too different from past experience."" And as he and other researchers have noted, if the country hadn’t moved to stop the spread of COVID-19, deaths would have mounted astronomically — which would have brought economic devastation in its own right. A TikTok user said it’s the economic downturn, not the coronavirus, ""that’s killing people."" He brought up the statistic that a 1% rise in unemployment causes 58,000 additional deaths over five years, due to heart attacks, drug abuse and other ""diseases of despair."" The researcher whose work lies behind that statistic said it doesn’t apply and that he has no question that current deaths, now over 80,000, stem from the virus. No analyst said the immediate scale of deaths could be tied to rising unemployment. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971BBB80>],/factchecks/2020/may/14/blog-posting/false-tiktok-claim-high-unemployment-killing-more-/

Pa. House Speaker says coronavirus only threatens children in poor health. That’s not true.
","Arguing that Pennsylvania should move quickly to reopen its economy even as coronavirus cases surge in some areas, the state House’s Republican leader said this weekend that reopening schools in the fall should be a top priority. Not only do students deserve a chance to perform experiments in science labs and play instruments in recitals, House Speaker Mike Turzai said children are largely protected from the ravages of the virus because of their youth and would be safe if they go back to school. ""Guess what, they’re not at risk unless they have an underlying medical issue,"" said Turzai, whose comments came in a video he recorded from his Allegheny County home and later shared on social media. We wondered whether school-age children are as safe as the house speaker says. Turzai was on the right track when he said that children in poor health who contract the coronavirus are at risk of becoming seriously ill. And it’s true that children are far less susceptible than adults. But his claim that other children are totally safe is incorrect, according to a study published recently in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics. Turzai declined to provide any evidence he relied on when he made this claim. Testifying before the Senate this week, Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease doctor, warned Americans not to be ""cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects."" The study followed 48 children and young adults with COVID-19 who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in the U.S. and Canada in March and April. Roughly one out of every five children studied had no underlying conditions. The others suffered from immune suppression, obesity, diabetes, seizures, or chronic lung disease. In some cases, the impact of the virus was devastating. The Rutgers University researchers who authored the study found that more than 20% of children experienced failure of two or more organ systems and almost 40% required a breathing tube and ventilator. At the end of the study period, a third of the children the researchers tracked were still hospitalized. Two of the children had died. ""Children without chronic illness are also at risk,"" the study authors wrote. ""Parents need to continue to take the virus seriously."" Publication of the study came the same day New York City officials announced that a growing cluster of children sickened with the coronavirus have developed a serious condition called pediatric multi-symptom inflammatory syndrome. So far, at least 52 children have been diagnosed with the syndrome, which causes high fever and swelling and may cause heart and kidney failure. Most are between the ages of 5 and 9. New York City officials said symptoms of the syndrome vary from patient to patient but include fever, rash, bright red lips, swollen hands and feet and abdominal pain. One five-year-old has died. ""This was not something that the health care community saw on their radar,"" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday at his daily coronavirus briefing. ""Then in the last week or two, suddenly, we’re seeing something that’s very troubling.""   In other parts of New York state, 21 additional children with coronavirus symptoms have become seriously ill.  It’s unclear whether any of the children sickened by pediatric multi-symptom inflammatory syndrome had underlying medical conditions.  Half of the children in New York City who were diagnosed with the syndrome tested positive for COVID-19, meaning their bodies are battling an active infection and the syndrome simultaneously. Almost  two dozen other children with the syndrome tested positive for antibodies against the disease, meaning they had previously contracted the virus and recovered before they developed symptoms of the syndrome. It’s not known how many Pennsylvania children may have developed pediatric multi-symptom inflammatory syndrome. According to data from the state Department of Health, fewer than 3% of the almost 60,000 known coronavirus cases across the state are among children and teenagers. Speaking about the coronavirus, Turzai said children are ""not at risk unless they have an underlying medical issue."" A new study and a growing number of gravely ill children in New York City prove otherwise. We rate this statement False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BCDC80>],/factchecks/2020/may/14/mike-turzai/pa-house-speaker-says-coronavirus-only-threatens-c/
"['Health Check', 'Coronavirus', 'Donald Trump']","
Trump’s comparison of COVID-19 deaths in Germany, US is wrong
","Following weeks of criticism over his administration’s COVID-19 response, President Donald Trump pulled out new statistics to claim the nation is actually among the best in the world in fighting the lethal coronavirus. ""Germany and the United States are the two best in deaths per 100,000 people, which, frankly, to me, that's perhaps the most important number there is,"" Trump said at a May 11 Rose Garden press briefing. We’ve followed the numbers closely on this. Germany has won praise for its early and aggressive testing-and-tracing response to the pandemic. The United States has not. With that in mind, we wondered: Are these countries so similar? And are they really the ""two best""? We contacted the White House to find out the basis for the president’s statement and never heard back. But of all the datasets tracking COVID-19 deaths, none supports anything near Trump’s assertion. And when you look at the numbers on which experts rely, Trump’s claim is at best misleading. The United States’ rate of COVID deaths per capita is better than many countries — but in no universe is it one of ""the two best."" Deaths per 100,000 people — the per capita metric Trump used — is generally considered a valuable public health measure that helps quantify the intensity of an epidemic. In this situation, it tracks how many people have died from COVID-19 in relation to countries’ populations. It’s an imperfect measure, to be sure. Globally, COVID-19 deaths are typically undercounted, since countries aren’t testing all the people who have been infected, let alone counting all deaths attributed to the virus. And comparing the numbers gets trickier when you place countries like Germany, which has tested large swaths of the population, against the United States, which has not. But even when comparing apples with oranges, Trump’s claim inflated just how well the United States has performed. ""It is not supported by the facts,"" said Jennifer Kates, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. We looked at four credible estimates, all of which were recommended by health researchers: Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus death count, along with global estimates published by the Kaiser Family Foundation, Our World in Data and Worldometer. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.) The Hopkins death count estimates that, in the United States, 24.66 people per 100,000 have died of COVID-19, as of May 12. In Germany, meanwhile, the rate is 9.24 — meaning the American death rate is 2.5 times that of Germany. And that’s only part of the issue. When compared with many other countries — including Canada, South Korea, Iran, Russia, Poland and Switzerland — the U.S. numbers don’t do very well. ""We have higher levels of deaths per capita than [those] countries and many others,"" said Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University. That’s true no matter the dataset. The United States performs better than countries like Spain and Italy, but still far worse than Germany and worse than numerous other countries. In fact, per Our World in Data’s estimates, the United States’ rate of COVID-19 deaths per capita isn’t just worse than what we see in countries like Canada and South Korea. It’s also worse than the global average. As of May 12, 36.66 per million people had died of COVID for the entire world — in the United States, it was 243.76 deaths per million people. There is another way to look at the numbers, Kates said. Instead of the cumulative number of people who have died per capita since the pandemic began, one can consider whether the United States is performing better when it comes to recent deaths. If American numbers were similar to that of Germany within a specific window of time, it would suggest that the United States is approaching a similar point in efforts to alleviate the crisis. Even then, the United States falls short. As of May 12, numerous countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Russia and Italy, had fewer daily deaths per capita based on a seven-day average than did the U.S. — suggesting that the risks here are still greater than they are in those nations. So, big picture? It is misleading to suggest the United States and Germany are in the same league, especially when it comes to COVID deaths per capita. It’s flat-out untrue to suggest that the United States is one of the ""two best,"" when countless other nations are seeing far lower death rates per 100,000 people. ""The claim is false,"" Shaman said. Trump claimed that, when it comes to COVID-19 fatalities, ""Germany and the United States are the two best in deaths per 100,000 people."" This is untrue. While the metric Trump highlighted is important, there are countless countries performing far better than the United States on COVID deaths per capita. And it is misleading at best to categorize the American fatality count in the same group as Germany’s; Germany’s numbers are better. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972FB880>],/factchecks/2020/may/13/donald-trump/trumps-claim-covid-deaths-us-are-par-germanys-does/

Sen. Chris Murphy overstates travel from China after Trump restrictions
","President Donald Trump often credits restrictions he imposed on travel from China with saving American lives. But Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said the ""ban"" didn’t stop everyone. ""We have had just an absolute abysmal failure of leadership from the White House since the very beginning,"" Murphy told MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace in a May 11 interview. ""Effectively, after the travel ban — a travel ban that just didn't work, 400,000 people got in from those countries that were subject to the restrictions — after that, the president just gave up."" We won’t weigh in on whether the travel ban ""just didn’t work,"" as Murphy claimed. But Murphy is wrong on the number. He mixed up two numbers from an April 4 New York Times report.  The New York Times analysis detailed the number of travelers that arrived in the U.S. on direct flights from China toward the start of 2020. The analysis relied on flight and other data from the U.S. Commerce Department, American firms MyRadar and FlightAware, and VariFlight, an aviation data company based in China, according to the report. RELATED: Are COVID-19 travel restrictions ‘more critical in saving lives’ than testing? Not really Murphy was referring to a larger number that included travel both before and after Trump’s restrictions kicked in. According to the report, there were at least 430,000 people who flew directly into the U.S. from China between Dec. 31, 2019, when China notified the World Health Organization that it was treating cases of pneumonia caused by an unknown illness, and early April.  That total included a smaller number of travelers whose direct flights occurred after Trump imposed travel restrictions on China starting Feb. 2 — and this smaller number is what Murphy should have used when talking about what happened after the restrictions. Almost 40,000 ""Americans and other authorized travelers"" entered in the two months after the Trump administration announced the restrictions, the report said. The travel restrictions made exceptions for U.S. citizens, permanent residents and their family members.  The New York Times report mentioned both numbers in its first paragraph: ""Since Chinese officials disclosed the outbreak of a mysterious pneumonialike illness to international health officials on New Year’s Eve, at least 430,000 people have arrived in the United States on direct flights from China, including nearly 40,000 in the two months after President Trump imposed restrictions on such travel, according to an analysis of data collected in both countries."" Murphy spokesperson Jaime Geller said the senator ""misspoke and meant to say that 400,000+ people traveled to the U.S. from the start of the outbreak, referencing this New York Times reporting."" The report said ""the bulk"" of the passengers arrived in January on more than 1,300 direct flights to the U.S. from China. It said 279 direct flights from China flew in between the time of the report and the start of Trump’s travel restrictions, which have since expanded in several ways.  Travelers check in for an American Airlines flight at Beijing Capital International Airport in Beijing, on Jan. 30, 2020. (AP/Schiefelbein) The New York Times’ passenger counts didn’t include the number of travelers who came from China through connecting flights, stopping in another country en route to the U.S. But a spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection gave us that information. The spokesperson said the agency’s preliminary data for both direct and indirect flights counted 68,409 authorized travelers — most of whom were U.S. citizens — that entered the U.S. from China between the implementation of the travel restrictions and May 11.  It’s unknown how many people who came into the U.S. from China had COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, or whether many of the individuals who returned to the U.S. in the months after the travel restrictions took effect were infected.  The first confirmed COVID-19 case in the U.S. returned to the state of Washington from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak was first documented. Chinese government data shows that the earliest known case was Nov. 17, per the South China Morning Post. Travel into the U.S. is currently prohibited for ""certain foreign nationals who have been physically present"" in China, Iran, Ireland, the United Kingdom or 26 other countries in Europe in the previous two weeks, the CBP spokesperson said. American citizens, legal residents and other exempted individuals can continue to travel into the U.S., the spokesperson said, but they require screening upon arrival and can only come in through one of 13 U.S. airports. RELATED: Rick Santorum said Trump was ‘ahead of the curve’ on China travel restrictions. That’s Mostly False Murphy said Trump implemented ""a travel ban that just didn't work, 400,000 people got in from those countries that were subject to the restrictions."" That is wrong. The New York Times reported a much lower number for people who flew directly into the U.S. from China after Trump’s limits went into effect — around 40,000 over two months. Those travelers were American citizens and other travelers exempted from the restrictions. The number is slightly higher when you factor in the number of travelers who took indirect flights and the number who have come in since the New York Times published its analysis in April. But it’s still far from 400,000. We rate Murphy’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A67C40>],/factchecks/2020/may/13/chris-murphy/sen-chris-murphy-overstates-travel-china-after-tru/

Fact-checking a claim about hotel rooms and the homeless in New York City
","New York City has been hit especially hard by coronavirus, and the city’s homeless population in particular has struggled to comply with social distancing practices that public health officials have urged to contain the pandemic. In an urgent letter to Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo on April 3, 2020, a group of service and advocacy groups pressed for action.  The letter, spearheaded by the New York City-based Coalition for the Homeless, said that only 16.8% of New York City hotel rooms were occupied at the time, leaving more than 100,000 rooms empty. Yet at the same time, the groups said, more than 3,588 people were living on the streets and over 19,000 were living in shelters.  Five days later, Giselle Routhier, the policy director for the Coalition for the Homeless, told the New York Daily News, ""We could open up tens of thousands of hotel rooms and offer every single person on the subway access to them. The mayor has absolutely to this point refused to do that."" Is this accurate? Yes, though the assertion needs some additional context. (The mayor’s office did not respond to inquiries for this article.) There is longstanding precedent for the city paying hotels to provide emergency housing for New York City residents. In 2018, for instance, the city spent $364 million on annual contracts for emergency housing in hotels for homeless New Yorkers.  The challenge is the expense of paying for these hotel rooms. ""The city has routinely used hotels as ‘emergency’ housing, but the cost has been exorbitant, ranging from $170 to $250 per night for one dwelling unit,"" Roderick M. Hills Jr., a New York University law professor, told PolitiFact. On April 23, Erin Drinkwater, the city’s deputy commissioner of the Department of Social Services, testified that prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the department paid $17 million per month to rent approximately 3,500 double-occupancy hotel rooms for homeless single adults.  Under proposed legislation requiring single-occupancy rooms, that cost would increase to $28 million per month, due to the cost of additional hotel rooms as well as security and operational needs, Drinkwater testified.  In her testimony, Drinkwater said that in addition to the 3,500 individuals already living in hotels, the city planned to move another 2,500 individuals — including people over 70, those with underlying health conditions, and those staying in the 10 most densely populated city shelters — to hotels by the end of April.  The Coalition for the Homeless told PolitiFact that Routhier’s reference to tens of thousands of hotel rooms was not the number simply to house ""every single person on the subway,"" but rather the entire homeless population throughout the city, which is estimated to exceed 22,000. The group did not provide a specific number of homeless New Yorkers living in the subway system. ""The coalition has called for (hotels) to be used not only for homeless New Yorkers sheltering in the subway system, but also the many thousands more in congregate homeless shelters where social isolation is impossible and where Covid-19 is spreading,"" said Dan Levitan, a spokesman for the coalition.  A complication is that some hotel rooms have been converted for hospital use. The city said it planned to convert 250 hotel rooms in five hotels into hospital facilities, the Daily News reported on March 19.  Routhier said, ""We could open up tens of thousands of hotel rooms and offer every single person on the subway access to them. The mayor has absolutely to this point refused to do that.""  The city already does contract with hotels to house New Yorkers facing emergency homelessness, and the number of homeless individuals the city has moved into hotels has increased since the onset of the pandemic.  However, the number of rooms being used for this purpose is well short of the ""tens of thousands"" of rooms needed to house all of New York City’s homeless population. The main reason is the high cost.
