Has COVID-19 killed more cops than all other causes?
","At the Republican National Convention, President Donald Trump cast himself as a stalwart friend of police and an effective leader in the fight against COVID-19. In a speech in Pittsburgh, Democratic nominee Joe Biden said Trump was neither. ""Do you feel safer under Donald Trump?"" Biden asked Aug. 31. ""More cops have died from COVID this year than have been killed on patrol."" That stat raised eyebrows, and we checked to see if it was true. Biden didn’t say exactly what the best data show, but the comparison is largely accurate. Tallies of deaths by two national groups show that COVID-19 has killed more law enforcement officers than gunfire and other hazards of the job in 2020. The caveat to Biden’s claim is there is some statistical fuzziness regarding who is a cop and what it means to be on patrol.  Roughly one-third of these tallies include corrections and detention center officers who work inside institutions where the virus can spread more readily. Some Customs and Border Protection field officers and other first responders are also included. While these occupations are counted as part of law enforcement, they might not come to mind as the cops that Biden referred to.  The COVID-19 death toll is still the greatest single cause of death when those occupations are excluded. The National Law Enforcement Officer Memorial Fund lists 101 dead officers from COVID-19 compared with 87 from anything else, including gunfire, car accidents or other causes. If it weren’t for COVID-19, officer deaths were on track to be lower this year than last. The National Law Enforcement Officer Memorial Fund says on its website that before it adds an officer to its list of deaths due to the virus, ""substantive evidence will be required to show the death was more than likely due to the direct and proximate result of"" exposure in the line of duty. Another source, the Officer Down Memorial Page, shows 101 deaths from COVID-19 and 81 deaths from all other causes. Communications director Jessica Rushing said the count is updated daily. (The Fraternal Order of Police has tracked 208 deaths from COVID-19, but not fatalities from other causes. It notes that it doesn’t verify the COVID-19 deaths.) According to Rushing’s group, gunfire is the second most common cause of death.  By a factor of three, COVID-19 is the leading cause of death for the broad group of officers. That has as much to do with the pattern of police fatalities as it does with the virus, said Rutgers criminologist Frank Edwards. Deaths in the line of duty due to any cause tend to average about eight each month.  FBI data on deaths in the line of duty further back this point. The FBI numbers distinguish between accidental and felonious deaths of officers in the community. They show that in a typical month, criminal acts kill less than five officers a month. Excluding the corrections and detention officers, the toll from COVID-19 remains at about 70 in the Officer Down count — still double the loss of life due to gunfire, but not higher than the sum of other causes of death. Biden said that more cops have died from COVID-19 than while on patrol. COVID-19 by itself has killed more law enforcement officers than all other causes combined, according to two groups that track these numbers. No matter how we parsed the data — by excluding correctional and detention center officers, or by focusing on felonious deaths to officers that could be considered ""on patrol"" — COVID-19 posed the greatest single threat to officers’ lives. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2020/sep/02/joe-biden/has-covid-19-killed-more-cops-all-other-causes/

Johnson misses mark with claim Evers, Barnes participated in rallies that incited Kenosha chaos
","Wisconsin’s elected officials didn’t hesitate to point fingers at one another after Kenosha police officer Rusten Sheskey shot Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, seven times at close range on Aug. 23, 2020.  The shooting and the video of it that went viral ignited days of protest and unrest in the city, which reached a breaking point Aug. 26, 2020 when an Illinois teen — who had joined a group of armed people responding to a Facebook call to protect and defend the city — shot and killed two people, according to criminal charges.  Wisconsin Democrats say their counterparts across the aisle haven’t done enough to act on racial disparities and police brutality, criticizing GOP leaders for gaveling out of an Aug. 31, 2020 special session called by Gov. Tony Evers to address such issues in less than 30 seconds.  Republicans, meanwhile, have pointedly blamed Evers, saying the deaths of the two people that Kyle Rittenhouse is accused of shooting could have been avoided if the state had been more aggressive earlier about deploying National Guard troops. Trump appeared in Kenosha on Sept. 1, 2020 to meet with local law enforcement officers and business owners, despite a plea from Evers and other Democratic state leaders to stay away during a painful time for the city.  U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, welcomed the visit and in an Aug. 31, 2020 statement blasted Evers and Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, saying that instead of working with Trump they ""made statements, leapt to conclusions, and have participated in rallies that have done more to incite than calm the situation.""  Did Evers and Barnes participate in rallies that have ""done more to incite than calm the situation in Kenosha,"" as Johnson claims?  Johnson’s office did not respond to a request for the evidence that he used to make the claim, but his statement echoes an Aug. 25, 2020 claim from state Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, that Evers and Barnes did not ""call for peace"" or ""encourage calm"" after Blake was shot.  We rated that claim Mostly False. Evers released a video statement the day prior asking protesters to remain peaceful.  What about the rallies? Besides a joint news conference on Aug. 27, 2020 in Kenosha, Evers and Barnes have not appeared together publicly to discuss the situation.   Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback said the pair have gone to one rally between the two of them, an Aug. 29, 2020 event that Blake’s family asked Barnes to attend.  Barnes met with Blake’s family, spoke at the event and marched alongside thousands who showed, Cudaback said.  Reports from the rally confirm it was a peaceful one, but the Republican Party of Wisconsin and the Kenosha News seized on a comment near the end of the event in which an unidentified  man took the microphone, decried police shootings of Black people and said, ""If you kill one of us, it’s time for us to kill one of yours.""  The remarks were met with a muted response from the crowd. To be sure, the comment strayed from the message of the event. In the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s reporting, Blake’s father, Jacob Blake Sr., is quoted asking people to be calm and civil, saying, ""If we tear it up, we have nothing.""   Barnes, meanwhile, spoke on the importance of voting and continued activism, commended Blake’s family for their resilience despite ""centuries of injustice"" that Black people have endured and urged the crowd to demand accountability from police departments.  In any case, Johnson’s claim was that the rally did more ""to incite than calm the situation."" But examining the timeline of the last week in the city, the violence and property destruction in Kenosha took place in the days before the Saturday rally — not after.  Protests and cases of arson and looting began the night Blake was shot and reached a chaotic point two nights later, on the night Rittenhouse is charged with killing two and injuring one.  The rally Barnes attended was days later. Indeed, Johnson himself noted during Trump’s visit that the situation in Kenosha became much calmer after the night where the protesters were shot. He credits the president. But in praising Trump for bringing calm, he undermines his claim here that an event days later attended by Barnes somehow incited violence again. In short, it can’t be both. Johnson claimed that Evers and Barnes ""have participated in rallies that have done more to incite than calm the situation"" in Kenosha. Barnes was present at a rally where a threat was made, but the event was overall a peaceful one, and reports of violence tied to Blake’s shooting came before the rally, not after.   And Johnson himself, while praising Trump’s actions, has acknowledged things had been quiet for days before the Barnes speech -- and have remained so in the days since.

‘We are not on fire’: Authorities dispute Trump’s false claim about Portland
","The whole city of Portland, Ore., is not on fire, despite President Donald Trump’s claim that ""the entire city is ablaze all the time.""  The remark came during a White House press conference, when Trump criticized Portland’s mayor for his handling of ongoing protests in the city. Later that night, Trump told Fox News, ""Portland's been burning for many years, for decades it's been burning.""  Local authorities and journalists disputed both claims. ""We are not on fire. We have not been on fire,"" said Lt. Rich Chatman, a spokesperson for Portland Fire & Rescue, adding that there has been ""a steady and remarkable decline in the number of fires for the last few years and certainly decades."" Portland, Oregon’s largest city, drew national attention when federal agents swooped in against the wishes of local leaders to protect federal property that they said was at risk because of the protests, which have occurred every night since May.  Some have included incidents of vandalism and violence, leading businesses near the affected areas to close or board up their windows. But the problems have been mainly confined to small parts of the city, including the area near the federal Hatfield Courthouse. ""There’s a lot of damage around the federal courthouse,"" Chatman said. ""But the fact of the matter is this is a very small area of even downtown. We are not under siege."" ""For the average resident of Portland, they probably never lay eyes on some of these fires,"" Chatman added. ""This is a very concentrated area."" The Portland Police Bureau provided PolitiFact with a map and timeline of the protests from May 29 to Aug. 31. It details where each has taken place, whether a riot was declared, whether arrests were made, and whether the protesters used projectiles, fireworks, vandalism or fires.  By our count, there were 54 fires set across 95 nights of demonstrations, which have largely taken place at one of 10 discrete locations, according to the map and timeline.  A Department of Homeland Security officer emerges from the Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse after demonstrators lit a fire on Aug. 2, 2020, in Portland, Ore. (AP) Chatman said that in five or six incidents, fires were set to buildings that had people in them.  But in many cases, the fires have been set in trash cans, dumpsters or on the street. ""None of these fires have grown to a size that requires more than one of our fire engines,"" Chatman said. The individual fires don’t amount to a city on fire. ""Portland is not ablaze,"" said Charles Boyle, a spokesperson for Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, who pointed to a television news station webpage that shows live camera footage of different areas in the state, including parts of Portland. Trump has warned that Portland’s protests are an example of the type of unrest that he claims would go unchecked under former Vice President Joe Biden, his challenger in 2020 — even as the protests continue on his watch. The city, Trump has said, is ""under siege."" But the president’s description of a city gripped by violence and engulfed in flames has been challenged by journalists working in the area. In July, for example, the editorial board for the Oregonian wrote an opinion piece titled, ""Not under siege, but a city in need.""   Two people sit in Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland, Ore., on Aug. 27, 2020. (AP) The Oregonian’s news department reported on the disconnect between how Portland is known to its residents and how it has been portrayed by Trump and conservative media. Buzzfeed News and CNN have described the same discrepancy.  RELATED: No, these aren’t photos of Portland, Ore., after the protests We asked journalists from the Oregonian and other local news outlets about Trump’s claim. They described an on-the-ground reality in which most protesters have been peaceful, while a subset of people have clashed with police, graffitied buildings and ignited fires. The fires that have ensued have been quickly extinguished and confined to a few small parts of the city. ""Portland is not ablaze, though we do love the Trail Blazers,"" said Anna Griffin, the news director at Oregon Public Broadcasting, in a reference to the city’s NBA team. Street-level activism has been a feature of Portland’s culture for years, Griffin said. ""We’re a small city reckoning with centuries of racism — both within our law enforcement and laws themselves — and that reckoning isn’t tidy,"" added Alex Zielinski, the news editor at the Portland Mercury, an alternative newspaper. ""But no, we’re not on fire."" Trump said of Portland: ""The entire city is ablaze all the time."" While months of protests in Portland have seen many fires set to streets, trash cans, and buildings, those incidents have been confined to a few small sections of the city and relatively easy for the city’s fire department to extinguish. Most of the city has been unaffected. The whole city is not in flames. We rate Trump’s claim False.",/factchecks/2020/sep/01/donald-trump/we-are-not-fire-authorities-dispute-trumps-false-c/

Hoax distorts Chadwick Boseman’s death
","On Aug. 28, a statement from the family of Chadwick Boseman was tweeted from the actor’s verified Twitter account announcing that he had died.  ""Chadwick was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, and battled with it these last 4 years as it progressed to stage IV,"" the message said.

Facebook post mischaracterizes Democratic senators’ vote on abortion bill
","A viral image says that 41 senators voted "" to let babies scream until they die if born alive,"" paying special emphasis to  Sen. Kamala Harris, now the Democratic vice presidential nominee.  The image lists the names of 44 Democratic senators, with Harris’ name circled in red. A caption above the image reads: ""These are the 41 sickos who voted to let babies scream until they die if born alive."" The image cites SB 311, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protections Act, which would establish requirements for the care that practitioners must provide to an infant born after a failed abortion attempt, and include possible prison time for anyone who doesn’t meet the standards.  Many Democratic senators have said they do not support the bill, and most of them voted to block its progress through the Senate.  The effect of their vote was not to allow practitioners to let doctors and parents to leave babies to die, but to preserve the legal status quo, which already considers infants to be humans protected under the law.  When this Aug. 18 post was made, the Senate had not brought the bill to the floor for a final vote.  The senators listed in the post are those who voted no on a cloture motion, a procedural proposal that would have moved it toward a final vote in the Senate.  There have been two failed cloture votes on the bill so far, one in February 2019 and one in February 2020. During the first vote, 44 Democratic senators voted no, and on the second, 41 voted no. All 53 Republicans voted in favor of the motion both times.  A cloture vote needs 60 votes to pass, so the bill stalled in the debate stage.  The image in the Facebook post lists 44 names, including Sens. Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who were absent during the second vote. (Sanders is an independent in the Senate). However, the caption above it references ""41"" who voted no. In either case, the image mischaracterizes both the content of the bill and the effect of the Democratic senators’ votes.  Under SB 311, health care practitioners must treat a baby born after an attempted abortion as they would any other newborn, and immediately admit the child to the hospital. A person who violates these terms would be subject to criminal penalties, including a fine and/or up to five years of prison. A person who kills an infant after a failed abortion would be subject to prosecution for murder.  Senate Republicans cast the bill as ""anti-infanticide legislation,"" describing it as a simple choice between leaving infants to die or protecting them under the law. ""Everyone in the Senate ought to be able to say unequivocally that killing that little baby is wrong. This doesn't take any political courage,"" the bill’s sponsor, Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said on the Senate floor.  Some Democrats called the bill a case of government overreach that took decisions out of the hands of parents and medical professionals. They noted that it would apply to a small number of abortions that involve complex and difficult factors that often can’t be anticipated, such as cases where the mother’s life would be at risk or where an infant has been born with a terminal disease.  According to the Guttmacher Institute, 43 states have banned ""some abortions after a certain point in pregnancy."" In 2016, procedures performed in the 21st week of gestation or later accounted for 1.2% of all abortions. Deaths involving babies born alive after an attempted abortion are even rarer. A report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that looked at death certificates for infants from 2003-2014 showed ""143 deaths involving induced terminations"" during that 12-year period. Of these deaths, 97 involved a ""maternal complication, or one or more congenital anomalies.""  However, the CDC report acknowledged that this number could be an underestimate due to vague wording on some death certificates.  Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), whose name is included in the Facebook post, said the legislation ""would force doctors to perform ineffective, invasive procedures on fetuses born with fatal abnormalities … even if it’s against the best interests of the child.""  Most of the bill’s Democratic opponents explained their votes by noting that existing federal law and most states’ laws already provide protections for babies born alive after abortion attempts.  Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., for example, cited the murder conviction of Dr. Kermit Gosnell, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2013 for killing live-born infants after botched abortions at his Philadelphia clinic. Prosecutors in the case cited a Pennsylvania state law that says a baby delivered during an abortion and showing signs of life is considered alive, according to the New York Times.  Snopes found that 34 states currently have laws that explicitly affirm a duty of care for  infants and enforce penalties for failing to provide that care.  At the federal level, the Born-Alive Infants Protections Act, which President George W. Bush signed into law in 2002, defined ""born alive"" infants as human persons, subject to the same legal protections as any other child. Under this definition, anyone who kills an infant after a failed abortion can be prosecuted for murder, and health care practitioners are obligated to provide the same level of care they would give to any other infant.  But the 2002 law did not explicitly set out any federal penalties for health care practitioners who don’t provide such care, beyond those now in effect in 34 states. SB 311 would set a uniform standard for all 50 states.  Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University, told PolitiFact that even in the 16 states that do not lay out an affirmative duty of care, leaving a baby to die would be considered a murder by omission. ""If you had an elderly adult and you decided to starve them to death, that would be a homicide. Once a child is born alive, the same rules apply to them,"" said Ziegler.  SB 311 would come into play only during the rare and extremely complex cases where the facts of an attempted abortion are disputed.  ""When you have an alleged infanticide, it’s a he-said-she-said situation, where an abortionist says that an infant was not born alive and prosecutors said she was,"" Ziegler said. ""Many of these cases end in mistrials because the jury simply doesn’t know what took place.""  The bill would make these prosecutions easier by placing responsibility for an infant’s health more squarely on the abortionist.  A viral image says that 41 senators voted ""to let babies scream until they die if born alive,"" paying special emphasis to Harris.  The image mischaracterizes the votes that have been conducted on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protections Act and the effect of the legislation on protections for infants born following abortion attempts.  In voting against cloture, Democratic senators didn’t vote to roll back protections for live-born infants but rather to keep them as they are. So the Facebook post’s claim that their vote allowed parents and doctors to let infants ""scream until they die"" exaggerates the effect of their vote.  We rate this post False. ​",/factchecks/2020/sep/01/viral-image/facebook-post-mischaracterizes-democratic-senators/

Trump paints false picture of Kyle Rittenhouse shootings ahead of Kenosha visit
","Editor's note: This item was updated to make clear that we are rating whether Trump described what happened accurately, not the separate question of whether what happened amounted to self-defense or, as charged by local prosecutors, homicide and other offenses. President Donald Trump visited Kenosha on Sept. 1, 2020 as the city reels from the shooting of a Black man by police and the shooting deaths of two protesters during a night of chaos.  Jacob Blake, 29, was shot in the back seven times at close range by Officer Rusten Sheskey on Aug. 23, 2020 as he walked away from officers and tried to get into an SUV with three of his children inside. The shooting left him paralyzed from the waist down, according to his family.  Two nights later, an Illinois teenager used an AR-15-style rifle to kill two protesters and injure a third, according to eyewitness videos and a criminal complaint. The charges against Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, increased tensions in a city that was already on edge, with some condemning his actions and others saying he was protecting the city and only shot in self-defense. In an Aug. 31, 2020 media briefing, on the eve of his visit to Kenosha, Trump defended Rittenhouse’s actions when asked about the teenager.  ""You saw the same tape as I saw,"" Trump said. ""And he was trying to get away from them, I guess; it looks like. And he fell, and then they very violently attacked him. And it was something that we’re looking at right now and it’s under investigation."" He went on to say of Rittenhouse: ""I guess he was in very big trouble. He would have been — I — he probably would have been killed."" The president correctly describes some minor details about that night. But overall, his comments grossly mischaracterize what happened — leaving out that by the time of the events he described, prosecutors say Rittenhouse had already shot and killed a man. In this fact-check, we are not examining the question of whether Rittenhouse acted in self-defense, as his attorney claims. We are examining whether Trump is providing an accurate description of what happened by focusing on only a portion of the events of that night. He is not. Let’s take a look.  Details of the Aug. 25, 2020 shootings have emerged through eyewitness videos and a criminal complaint filed in Kenosha County Circuit Court.  Here’s what we know:  Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, approached Rittenhouse and a reporter interviewing him that night and began to chase Rittenhouse after he did a ""juke"" move. Rosenbaum threw a plastic bag at Rittenhouse, but it didn’t hit him.  The two ended up in a parking lot, and the reporter told authorities that Rosenbaum tried to grab Rittenhouse’s gun. Rittenhouse fired four shots, and Rosenbaum dropped to the ground in front of him. In a video, Rittenhouse can be heard saying on his cell phone, ""I just killed someone."" Rittenhouse began running slowly down the street as a crowd began to follow him, with some people shouting ""get him!"" and shouting he just shot someone. Rittenhouse tripped and fell.  While he was on the ground, police say, he appeared to fire two shots at a man who jumped over him but missed.  After that, Anthony Huber, 26, ran up to Rittenhouse with a skateboard in one hand and appeared to hit him with it before reaching for Rittenhouse’s gun. Rittenhouse fired one round that hit Huber in the chest and killed him. Rittenhouse sat up and pointed his gun at Gaige Grosskreutz, 26, who had started to approach him. Grosskreutz took a step back and put his hands in the air, but then moved toward Rittenhouse, who fired a shot that hit Grosskreutz in the arm. Grosskreutz had a handgun. It is unclear whether Grosskreutz was pointing the gun at Rittenhouse, or if Rittenhouse saw that Grosskreutz had a gun. Trump’s comments completely overlook the fact that people started following him after he allegedly shot and killed someone. He also claimed protesters ""violently attacked"" Rittenhouse, but that is not fully supported by the videos, either. Witnesses say those who were chasing Rittenhouse were trying to stop him. Rittenhouse later walked past a group of police vehicles, hands in the air, and ultimately returned home to nearby Antioch, Illinois, where he was arrested the next day. What’s more, Trump suggested the matter is ""under investigation."" But while Rittenhouse’s attorney has indicated he would argue self defense, the teen has already been charged with homicide. It’s unclear what, if any, investigation would still be open. Even before the comments, Trump drew headlines when he ""liked"" a tweet that said, ""Rittenhouse is a good example of why I decided to vote for Trump."" Rittenhouse, who is in jail awaiting extradition to Kenosha to face charges, is a Trump supporter. Trump said a video shows Rittenhouse ""was trying to get away from"" protesters""  and ""fell, and then they violently attacked him."" Rittenhouse did fall as a crowd followed him, but Trump’s comments leave an incendiary and false picture: By the time he fell, according to criminal charges, Rittenhouse had already shot and killed one person that night.  We rate the claim False.  ",/factchecks/2020/sep/01/donald-trump/trump-paints-false-picture-kyle-rittenhouse-shooti/

Kenosha police did let Kyle Rittenhouse go, but claim goes too far in labeling his beliefs
","A volatile climate in Kenosha turned violent after an Illinois teen allegedly killed two protesters and injured another amid turmoil over the shooting by police of Jacob Blake.  Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, was charged with first-degree intentional homicide and five other crimes on Aug. 27, 2020. He is accused of using an AR-15-style rifle to shoot and kill Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and injure Gaige Grosskreutz, 26.  The violence came days after Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back seven times at point-blank range by a Kenosha police officer. Blake remains hospitalized and paralyzed from the waist down, according to his family, as protesters renew calls to combat police brutality that disproportionately affects Black people. Rittenhouse’s arrest prompted scrutiny of the teenager’s background and frustration over his treatment by Kenosha police — particularly when compared to Blake’s treatment by officers days prior.  U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, a Milwaukee Democrat, weighed in with this tweet Aug. 26, 2020:  ""The same police department who shot an unarmed black man 7 times in the back for walking away from them just let an armed white supremacist walk right past them after shooting people."" We previously looked at claims about the shooting of Blake, and whether he was armed, including that he ""declared he had a gun in the car and was going to go get it"" and was ""brandishing"" a knife. We rated that claim False. There was no gun, and while there are varying reports of whether he had a knife in his hand or it was found on the floorboard of the car he was entering, he was not ""brandishing"" it at police on the scene. So we will focus here on Moore’s characterization of how authorities in Kenosha treated Rittenhouse in the moments after the shooting. Let’s take a look at her account. When asked for evidence to support Moore’s claim, her office pointed to four news articles about the Aug. 25, 2020 incident that led to Rittenhouse’s arrest. Here’s what we know: According to eyewitness videos and the criminal complaint, Rittenhouse shot and killed Rosenbaum in a parking lot after Rosenbaum chased him and tried to grab his gun.  Rittenhouse then began running slowly down the street, but tripped and fell as a crowd began to follow him. While he was on the ground, Huber approached him with a skateboard in one hand and reached for Rittenhouse’s gun with the other. Rittenhouse fired one round that hit Huber in the chest and killed him. Rittenhouse sat up and pointed his gun at Grosskreutz, who took a step back but then moved toward Rittenhouse. He fired a shot that hit Grosskreutz in the arm. Afterward, video footage showed Rittenhouse approaching police vehicles with his hands raised. Several vehicles passed him after he waved toward the first. A voice can be heard yelling, ""Hey, he just shot them! Hey, dude right here just shot them!"" Another voice on a police loudspeaker is heard saying, ""Someone injured, straight ahead."" Rittenhouse ultimately returned to his hometown of nearby Antioch, Illinois, where he was later arrested. Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis defended his department’s actions in an Aug. 28, 2020 news conference, saying the police in the vehicles didn’t see Rittenhouse as a threat and wouldn’t have heard yelling from the crowd over other noise. He said officers were more focused on the injuries and what happened down the street. So, multiple sources — including the Kenosha Police Department — have verified that Rittenhouse walked by police after the shootings. Moore is on target with that part of the claim. Merriam-Webster defines a white supremacist as someone who ""believes that the white race is inherently superior to other races and that white people should have control over people of other races."" Video taken before the shootings showed Rittenhouse with a group of armed, older men linked to a local group called the Kenosha Guard. Leaders of the group, which that afternoon put out a call for people to bring weapons to defend Kenosha businesses, say Rittenhouse is not a member. But according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Rittenhouse identifies with such groups. ""People are getting injured and our job is to protect this business,"" Rittenhouse said in a video interview that night with The Daily Caller. ""And my job also is to protect people. If someone is hurt, I’m running into harm’s way. That’s why I have my rifle; I’ve gotta protect myself, obviously. But I also have my med kit."" Before it was taken down, Rittenhouse’s Facebook page showed several pro-police photos, including one that featured the phrase, ""Blue lives matter.""  Three of the four news reports cited by Moore’s office do not reference white supremacy or extremism. And the only one that does, an Aug. 27, 2020 article from CBS News, cites the Anti-Defamation League as saying Rittenhouse does not appear to be involved with any extremist movements. Oren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, echoed that in an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin. Based on a review of Rittenhouse’s TikTok, Facebook and Instagram accounts, Segal said, the organization has not found evidence linking Rittenhouse to white supremacist groups. Segal noted that Rittenhouse appears to embrace the Blue Lives Matter movement, which backs police officers and was created in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement. Segal said Blue Lives Matter is supported by some extremist groups, but also by many other people.  He contends misidentifying someone as a white supremacist can amount to ""crying wolf"" and minimize the seriousness of extremist beliefs and behaviors. ""We need to really be sober about what we are seeing, and we need to tackle it with some honesty and not just fall prey to inaccurate, perhaps politically expedient categorizations,"" Segal said.  In a tweet, Moore said in contrast to how a Black man who was shot by police was treated, Kenosha police officers ""let an armed white supremacist walk right past them after shooting people."" Kenosha police did let Rittenhouse walk by and ultimately return home to Illinois after prosecutors say he killed two protesters and injured a third.  But social media posts and profiles haven’t revealed any evidence linking him to white supremacist groups, according to a key organization that tracks extremist activity.  A statement is Half True when it’s partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Fact-checking Joe Biden in Pa. on his fracking policy
","Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden appeared Monday in Pittsburgh and defended his position on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking — a controversial drilling technique that has lifted the economy in western Pennsylvania.  ""I am not banning fracking. Let me say that again. I am not banning fracking. No matter how many times Donald Trump lies about me,"" said Biden, who spoke at a Carnegie Mellon robotics institute.  Biden’s remarks came after Trump, speaking Thursday on the final night of the Republican National Convention, accused him of wanting to ""abolish"" natural gas production in the U.S. Fracking is used to extract natural gas from reservoirs deep beneath the earth’s surface.  We’ve examined Biden’s position on fracking before, so we know he has not called for banning the practice entirely. He wants to block the federal government from issuing new permits for drilling on public lands but would allow existing fracking operations to continue.  The Biden campaign also noted in an email that 90 percent of fracking takes place on private land.  Biden’s position on fracking became muddled earlier this year when he misspoke during a March debate with Bernie Sanders, his last opponent standing in the Democratic primary. Here’s an excerpt of their exchange: ""I’m talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can,"" Sanders said. ""I’m talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet — no ifs, buts, and maybes about it."" ""So am I,"" Biden replied. ""Well, I’m not sure your proposal does that,"" Sanders said. ""No more — no new fracking,"" Biden said. Biden seemed to be saying he wanted to ban fracking — a sharp departure from his official position. And the former vice president’s opponents pounced. Republican operatives quickly cut a short video of Biden’s remarks to use as a cudgel in races against moderate House Democrats, the Washington Post reported. And Sanders supporters accused Biden of misleading voters about his policy, which wouldn’t ban fracking, like Sanders wanted to do. The Biden campaign retracted his remarks the night of the debate, but that hasn’t stopped conservative media outlets from inaccurately reporting that Biden supports a total ban on fracking.  Biden said he’s ""not banning fracking"" if he wins in November. To ban means to prohibit, and Biden doesn’t want to prohibit fracking entirely. He would allow existing fracking  to continue. Biden does, however, want to stop issuing new permits for fracking on public lands, and he left that part out of his speech in Pittsburgh. Biden’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2020/sep/01/joe-biden/fact-checkin-joe-biden-pa-his-fracking-policy/

No, Trump doesn't deserve credit for Kenosha de-escalation
","The images emerging from Kenosha were jarring after Jacob Blake was shot in the back seven times by a police officer and two protesters were shot and killed — all in the span of two days. Buildings in flames. People armed with baseball bats destroying property and looting. Armed vigilante groups roaming the streets with long guns. Police patrolling in armored vehicles and riot gear. But the atmosphere took a distinct turn for the better in the days after the Aug. 25, 2020, shooting that left 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse facing multiple homicide charges. And President Donald Trump says you can thank him for that. ""If I didn’t INSIST on having the National Guard activate and go into Kenosha, Wisconsin, there would be no Kenosha right now,"" Trump tweeted early on Aug. 31, 2020. ""Also, there would have been great death and injury."" It’s not a new maneuver from Trump, who has regularly swooped in to claim credit for development projects and other initiatives he had little role in. But this claim is particularly jaw-dropping. His sweeping assertion assumes at least three things to be true. Kenosha was on a trajectory for destruction. No other changes happened that would have improved the Kenosha situation. He alone is responsible for activating the National Guard. Each of these is wrong. Let’s break it down. This is the most obvious hyperbole in Trump’s tweet. (It's also a claim he repeated even more strongly the next day, saying during a Sept. 1 roundtable with Kenosha leaders, ""I come into an area like this and I see the town is burned down."") The events in Kenosha have been tragic and shocking. But there’s a big difference between protests damaging a limited area and destroying or altering a large portion of a city of 100,000 people. The protests, even at the peak of the unrest Aug. 25, were largely concentrated in the 1-acre Civic Park and a nearby area a few blocks wide. Though people spilled into nearby neighborhoods after the largest groups were dispersed. That drastically exaggerates the scope of the situation in Kenosha, a city of 28.4 square miles, even at its worst. Trump’s attempt to claim credit assumes the National Guard presence was the only factor in the lack of violence after the Rittenhouse shooting. There are many reasons that’s wrong. The simple makeup of the crowd changed. A group described by Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth as ""a militia"" and ""vigilante group"" had been patrolling the streets of Kenosha and even standing watch on roofs with long guns the first couple nights after the Blake shooting. On Tuesday, in the hours before the shooting, the ""Kenosha Guard""  issued a call on Facebook for ""patriots willing to take up arms and defend out (sic) City tonight from the evil thugs."" That page was removed by Facebook after the Rittenhouse shooting, and the presence of people wearing military gear and openly carrying weapons dropped drastically after the night of chaos that included the shooting, according to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporters who have been on the ground in Kenosha — though citizens with handguns were observed as late as the weekend. During the height of the protests, the vigilante groups and Black Lives Matter protesters were regularly clashing with each other, by hurling insults or worse. Removing half of that equation — for whatever reason that occurred — changed the situation dramatically. There have also been calls for peace from all corners, including Blake’s family, at marches and rallies, and — to varying degrees — from Gov. Tony Evers and local officials.  In addition, Evers has declared a state of emergency, and local officials have taken steps such as closing off freeway access to better control the area — beyond simply increasing the number of troops (which has also happened). ""The last five days have been closer to normal for Kenosha,"" Beth said at an Aug. 31 news conference. ""And really if you go outside a few block area in Kenosha, life has been just like it has been all the time."" All of which brings us to the most fundamental claim here — that Trump dispatched the National Guard. And even that isn’t true. The White House described itself as authorizing 2,000 National Guard troops to go to Kenosha. But Maj. Gen. Paul Knapp, who commands the Wisconsin National Guard, said that’s not really how that system operates.  He described it this way when asked Aug. 31 what role the White House has played in the Kenosha response. ""What I want to re-emphasize is the process is actually a governor-to-governor compact,"" Knapp said. ""Through the (Emergency Management Assistance Compact) process we had already started talking to other states (when the White House got involved), it’s one of the things we do right away during something like this."" The White House press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment early on Sept. 1. Each state has its own National Guard — as provided for in the Constitution — and the guard has a role at both the state and federal level, according to its website. Governors can call the National Guard into action during local or statewide emergencies, and the president can activate the guard for federal missions. Examples of federal missions given on the website included deployments to Kosovo or the anti-terrorism efforts in the Middle East. But all National Guard members working in Kenosha have been mobilized by Evers or governors in Michigan, Arizona and Alaska as part of the inter-state agreements. They are commanded by Knapp and remain under state control. The Kenosha effort has not been federalized, said Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback. In other words, none of the National Guard troops now in Wisconsin have been dispatched or authorized by Trump. And the state-run efforts to bring troops were underway a full day before Trump first had contact with Wisconsin officials.  ""The governor had already activated the Wisconsin National Guard to respond in Kenosha and doubled their presence before Trump or his Administration offered federal support,"" Cudaback said. The timeline of events in Kenosha makes this crystal clear. Here are key moments in the Kenosha unrest and the law enforcement response, as detailed by Evers’ office and media reports. Times of key events are provided where relevant. Sunday, Aug. 23 5:15 p.m. — Jacob Blake is shot. 9:31 p.m. — Wisconsin Emergency Management authorizes neighboring agencies to assist local law enforcement. Monday, Aug. 24 3:05 a.m. — Kenosha County requests a National Guard Quick Reaction Force, a team trained to deploy anywhere in the state within 12 hours. Evers then formally endorses that request. The National Guard provides 125 troops — the full number who are part of that team. Neighboring jurisdictions provide more than 100 law enforcement officers. Tuesday, Aug. 25 2:33 p.m. — Evers’ office sends a bulletin declaring a state of emergency and increasing the National Guard support from 125 to 250. 2:45 p.m. — The Trump administration speaks to Evers (first Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, then Trump himself). Evers ultimately declines offers of federal help.  7:16 p.m. — Trump tweets implying the National Guard was not in Wisconsin — ""Governor should call in the National Guard in Wisconsin. … End problem FAST!"" — though the guard at this point had already been on the ground for more than a day. 11:45 p.m. — Police say Rittenhouse opens fire on protesters, killing two and injuring a third.  Wisconsin began coordinating with other states about obtaining additional National Guard resources and support. The Wisconsin State Patrol provides more than 70 officers. Neighboring jurisdictions are still providing more than 100 law enforcement officers. Wednesday, Aug. 26 11 a.m. — Meadows talks to Evers again, with federal authorities ultimately sending FBI and U.S. Marshal support to the area later in the day. Cudaback said as of Aug. 31 this remained the only federal government assistance provided. The Wisconsin National Guard is now providing 500 troops. Neighboring jurisdictions are still providing more than 100 law enforcement officers. The Wisconsin State Patrol is now providing 80 officers. Thursday, Aug. 27 1:30 p.m. — Evers enters an agreement with other states to provide National Guard help as part of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact. The Wisconsin National Guard is now providing 750 troops. Friday, Aug. 28 12:01 p.m. — Trump tweets, ""Success: Since the National Guard moved into Kenosha, Wisconsin, two days ago, there has been NO FURTHER VIOLENCE, not even a small problem."" The National Guard had actually been deployed in Wisconsin for four days at this point, not two. The Wisconsin National Guard is now providing 1,000 troops. Arizona, Alabama and Michigan National Guard troops arrive, accounting for at least 500 more guardsman (total of 1,500). All of these troops are under Knapp’s command. Knapp said Aug. 31 that those 1,500 National Guard troops remained deployed in Kenosha. The guard members do not make arrests, but ""fulfill roles that allows those (local) law enforcement officers to be freed up"" to more active work in the streets, he said. We should also note Trump was taking steps before and after this claim that served more to increase division than limit it. On Aug. 30, Sunday night, he liked a tweet that said ""Rittenhouse is a good example of why I decided to vote for Trump.""  Rittenhouse is a Trump supporter. The next day, at a White house briefing, Trump asserted Rittenhouse was ""trying to get away"" and was ""violently attacked"" before opening fire — a description that ignores the fact Rittenhouse had already allegedly shot and killed a man prior to that point. Trump made a similar claim while visiting Kenosha Sept. 1, saying, ""Violence has stopped since the time the National Guard came — literally when they set their foot on this location it stopped."" The timeline shows this is clearly wrong. The National Guard had been in Kenosha for more than a day when the Rittenhouse shooting occured. Trump said on Twitter, ""If I didn’t INSIST on having the National Guard activate and go into Kenosha, Wisconsin, there would be no Kenosha right now."" That’s wrong on every level. It’s a vast exaggeration to say the situation in Kenosha was so dire as to threaten its very existence. And many other factors played a role in the reduced violence in the days before Trump’s tweet. But the most fundamental element of this claim is also completely wrong. National Guard troops were en route and even on the ground well before the Trump administration got involved. The National Guard troops ultimately sent were deployed in Wisconsin by Evers and Knapp or sent from other states as part of agreements entered into by the states’ governors. We rate this claim Pants on Fire. ",/factchecks/2020/sep/01/donald-trump/heres-why-trump-vastly-overreaches-claiming-credit/

Antifa.com redirects to Biden’s campaign website, but anyone can buy, redirect a domain
","Days after denouncing the deadly shooting in Portland, Ore., Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden blamed President Donald Trump for inciting violence in America’s streets and said Trump has made the country more dangerous. ""Rioting is not protesting, looting is not protesting, setting fires is not protesting, none of this is protesting,"" Biden said during a speech in Pittsburgh. ""It’s lawlessness, plain and simple, and those who do it should be prosecuted. Violence will not bring change, it will only bring destruction."" But some conservatives continue to criticize Biden for not specifically denouncing antifa, a movement of far-left, anti-fascists cited for using violent tactics, as a domestic terrorist organization. Now, a post on Facebook points out that typing in antifa.com automatically redirects internet users to joebiden.com, Biden’s official presidential campaign website. ""If you go to Antifa.com, it takes you directly to joe bidens webpage....whats that tell ya...try it yourself,"" the post says. This is actually true, but it doesn’t tell you anything. Anyone can buy a domain name and have it redirect to any existing website. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  RELATED: No, Joe Biden didn’t single out antifa as ‘courageous’ While there’s no evidence that Biden’s campaign owns antifa.com, it did recently purchase  keepamericagreat.com to spotlight what it calls President Trump’s ""broken promises.""  We reached out to the campaign about the antifa.com redirect but did not hear back.  News outlets first reported the antifa.com redirect on Aug. 12, just after Sen. Kamala Harris was announced as Biden’s running mate. The site was removed about a day later, but has since resurfaced. Clifford Neuman, director of the University of Southern California’s Center for Computer Systems Security, says there are a couple of ways to redirect a website, but that in this instance, when a browser connects to antifa.com, it receives a response from the antifa.com server that tells it to go to joebiden.com instead, prompting the user’s browser to establish a new connection. ""Basically the way things work with domain names is, if you own a domain name, whether you’re the original purchaser or you purchased it from someone else, you can redirect your domain name to anywhere you wanted it to go,"" Neuman said, ""and that doesn’t require permission or any or coordination from the person you are trying to redirect to."" Neuman found that the antifa.com domain was first registered in 2000, and was most recently transferred to a new host in April 2020, though information on the new owner is hidden. According to Whois, an online domain registry, antifa.com was last updated on Aug. 14, 2020. The registrant is listed as ""WhoisGuard Protected,"" meaning the domain owner is using a service to remain anonymous.  The first time web archives show antifa.com displaying content sympathetic to the antifa movement was  May 31, 2020. But this is just a snapshot of the website from that day, and doesn’t mean it was created that day. On July 24, the page included a notice that said a new, updated website was coming soon. And, on Aug. 8, we find the first archived version that redirected visitors to joebiden.com.  Joe Biden has been the target of deceptive website practices before. In 2019, a Republican consulting firm created joebiden.info, a mock website that displayed images and videos of Biden appearing to touch and kiss young women and girls, fact-checking website Snopes reported. The firm also made fake websites about other Democratic primary candidates including Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris.  In 2019, state party chairs of the Democratic National Committee backed a pledge to rule out the use of illegitimate tactics like manipulated videos, fake social media accounts or websites, but party leaders did not bring the proposal to a vote.  The post is partially accurate, but it leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Instagram Posts Make False Claim CA Voters Will Be ‘Turned Away’ From Polls Due To Mail-In Voting
","Widely-shared posts on Instagram on Monday claimed California voters would be ""turned away"" from in-person polling places on Election Day unless they change their voting preference to ""No mail-in voting.""  Election experts quickly rejected that message.  We examined the details in this fact check. Our research The social media posts include an image of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and allege he changed the voting preference for ""EVERY single voter in CA"" to ""vote by mail."" It goes on to claim that this move will lead to people being turned away at polling places unless they make a change to their voter preference.  The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram).  We found this greatly distorts what Newsom did and makes a false accusation about its consequences. Here are the facts: Back in June, Newsom signed a law that requires counties to send all active registered voters a mail-in ballot this fall. He said the move was necessary due to health concerns over casting a ballot in-person during a pandemic. The law does not eliminate in-person voting options, though there won’t be as many polling places. Nor does it require voters to do anything different to vote in-person.  ""You do not need to change anything with your voter registration in order to participate in-person in this election,"" said Sam Mahood, spokesperson for the California Secretary of State’s Office, which oversees the state’s election.  Mahood described the claim about being ""turned away"" at the polls as ""definitely misinformation."" He said his office reported the posts to Instagram and Facebook and noted that some had been taken down. Mahood added that the new law does not alter the voting preference Californians select when they register to vote. If their preference is listed as in-person voting, they will continue to be listed that way in future elections.  California's In-Person Voting Options There are several ways California voters can participate in-person. Voters can fill out their ballot at home, place it inside the envelope provided and turn it in at a polling place, their county elections office or a ballot drop box. Voters must sign the outside of the envelope for their ballot to be counted.  If voters want to fill out a ballot at a polling place, election officials recommend they bring their vote-by-mail ballot with them to ""surrender"" it at the polls, which essentially means they will exchange it for a ballot at the polling location and the vote-by-mail ballot will be canceled.  Voters can also fill out their mail-in ballot at a polling place and turn it in onsite, though Mahood said election officials are encouraging people to fill out those ballots in advance to cut down on crowds at the polls. For those who don’t bring their vote-by-mail ballots, there are still options. They will receive either a provisional ballot or, if they are in a county that uses the new vote center model, poll workers should be able to print them a new and regular ballot onsite, Mahood said.  Kim Alexander, president of the California Voter Foundation, which advocates for voters, said there are ways the public can slow the spread of election misinformation.  She said officials are using the hashtag #TrustedInfo2020 to help voters identify reliable election information online. Meanwhile, the California Voter Foundation is urging voters ""to SIFT information before they share it."" SIFT stands for ""Stop, Investigate, Find reliable info, and Trace sources before sharing anything via social media,"" Alexander said.  As for the claim at the center of this fact check, Alexander agreed it ""is absolutely false."" ""We have many failsafes in our voting process to ensure no one is turned away,"" she said. Our rating Social media posts claimed California voters would be ""turned away"" from in-person voting unless they made a change online to their voter preference by selecting ""No mail-in voting.""  That is simply not the case. Voters don’t need to make any voting preference change to cast their ballot in-person.  All active registered voters will receive a mail-in ballot ahead of Election Day, as part of an effort to stay safe amid the pandemic.  But there are in-person voting options and none require Californians to make any changes to their voting preferences.  The claims in these social media posts are both inaccurate and reckless, deserving of our most severe designation.   We rate them Pants On Fire.  PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

House Republican’s video manipulates activist’s computerized voice to attack Biden
","House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., shared a video that used manipulated footage of activist Ady Barkan to falsely accuse former Vice President Joe Biden of wanting to defund the police. Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, has repeatedly rejected that position. The video created the false impression by splicing together clips from a July interview between Biden and Barkan, who has Lou Gehrig’s disease, also known as ALS. Barkan speaks through the use of a computerized device that translates his eye movements into an artificial voice.  The manipulation hinged on a portion of the interview where Biden talked about police reform. Scalise’s video spliced Barkan’s words to make it seem like he asked if Biden agreed ""that we can redirect some of the funding for police.""  But that was not a question that Barkan posed. The video was altered to add ""for police."" ""These are not my words,"" Barkan said in a tweet asking Scalise to remove the video and apologize to the disability community. ""I have lost my ability to speak, but not my agency or my thoughts. You and your team have doctored my words for your own political gain.""  .@SteveScalise, These are not my words. I have lost my ability to speak, but not my agency or my thoughts. You and your team have doctored my words for your own political gain. Please remove this video immediately. You owe the entire disability community an apology. https://t.co/N6G5RgMXlO The manipulated video was first reported by the Washington Post’s Dave Weigel, who tweeted screenshots highlighting its deceptive editing.  Twitter flagged the video as ""manipulated,"" after which Scalise deleted it and posted a new version that omitted the spliced footage of Barkan. The video was flagged according to Twitter’s policy against ""synthetic and manipulated media,"" a Twitter spokesperson confirmed.   There's a clip here of @AdyBarkan, who has ALS and speaks via voice assistance, asking Biden about ""re-directing"" public safety funding. The clip alters the quote. It splices ""for police"" into it, using Barkan's artificial voice. https://t.co/WKkbRzlrXF https://t.co/mUysm9YDeQ pic.twitter.com/uofqi9428E A Scalise spokesperson said the edit combined two of Barkan’s questions for time and clarity, and Scalise stood by the false suggestion that Biden wants to defund the police on Twitter.  ""Look, it shouldn’t have been edited,"" Scalise said on Fox News. ""But at the same time, the comments were always about — in fact, twice in that interview, he asked Joe Biden if he was for redirecting money away from police. And in both times, Joe Biden said yes."" In fact, Biden has proposed additional police reforms and oversight and called for a $300 million investment in a community policing grant program. The Biden-Barkan interview was posted July 8 by NowThis News, which edited it down to about 27 minutes. The Biden campaign previously gave PolitiFact an unedited audio recording of the exchange, since NowThis trimmed some of Biden’s responses to condense the conversation. The unedited audio shows that when Barkan steered the conversation toward racism and police brutality, Biden made clear that he does not support defunding the police. It also shows that, despite what Scalise’s video suggests, Barkan never asked, ""Do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding for police?"" Scalise’s video, which can be viewed via the Internet Archive, spliced two of Barkan’s questions together.  The questions came as Barkan proposed redirecting some police funds to social services. ""We can reduce the responsibilities assigned to police and redirect some of the funding for police into social services, mental health counseling, and affordable housing,"" Barkan said, suggesting that one particular killing might not have happened had a ""wellness counselor"" showed up at the scene instead of an officer. ""Are you open to that kind of reform?"" ""Yes, I proposed that kind of reform,"" Biden said, according to the unedited audio. ""And by the way, the idea though, that’s not the same as getting rid of or defunding all the police."" As Biden continued explaining his proposals for police reform, Barkan interjected: ""But do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?"" ""Yes. Absolutely,"" Biden said. ""And by the way, not just redirect, condition them. If they don’t eliminate chokeholds, they don’t get Byrne grants. If they don’t do the following, they don’t get any help."" Biden described a similar idea for oversight during an interview with CBS News in June. ""No, I don’t support defunding the police,"" he said. ""I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness and, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community."" Biden has proposed investing an additional $300 million in the Community Oriented Policing Services Program, or COPS. The program provides police departments with technical and training assistance, hiring grants and access to mental health and wellness resources. Biden has rejected the idea of defunding the police multiple times: in a spokesperson’s statement, in an op-ed, in a number of local and national news interviews, and in a questionnaire from an organization of law enforcement officers. Those in Barkan’s circle shared that takeaway. ""Ady Barkan and Vice President Biden agreed on a lot, and disagreed on issues like Medicare for All and defunding the police,"" said Liz Jaff, the president of Barkan’s Be A Hero political fund, in a statement on Scalise's video that Barkan shared on Twitter. Previously, Jaff told CNN that ""though Ady would have loved Joe Biden to announce in this interview that he is in favor of defunding the police, the vice president never said it."" Scalise shared a video that said Barkan asked Biden, ""Do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding for police?"" That’s not what Barkan asked. The video spliced together audio from two different questions, taking advantage of the fact that Barkan speaks with computer voice assistance.  Biden has repeatedly said he does not support defunding the police, including during his conversation with Barkan.

Bill Clinton says Hillary Clinton helped 'get done' the Children's Health Insurance Program
","Former President Bill Clinton said that after health care reform failed in the 1990s because they couldn’t break a Senate filibuster, Hillary Clinton sought to tackle health care reform piece by piece, including expanding health insurance for children. ""In 1997, Congress passed the Children's Health Insurance Program, still an important part of President Obama's Affordable Care Act. It insures more than 8 million kids,"" Clinton said in his speech at the second night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. ""There are a lot of other things in that bill she got done, piece by piece, pushing that rock up the hill.""    We will fact-check Hillary Clinton’s role in expanding health care for children. Children’s Health Insurance Program We have previously rated a few claims related to her role in the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. Some claims have been more careful in their wording about her role than others. We could not reach a Bill Clinton spokesman, but we previously interviewed a Hillary Clinton spokesman on the same topic. The CHIP program provides health care coverage to more than 8 million children, according to Medicaid. Created in 1997, when it was known as the State Children's Health Insurance Program, it promotes health coverage for low-income children by providing federal funding to states.    The late-Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass. received much of the credit for CHIP, because he shepherded the legislation through a Republican-controlled Congress. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch was the lead Republican cosponsor. In 2007, Kennedy told the Associated Press that Hillary Clinton played a critical role. ""The children's health program wouldn't be in existence today if we didn't have Hillary pushing for it from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue,"" Kennedy said. Nick Littlefield, a senior health adviser to Kennedy at the time, agreed. ""She wasn't a legislator, she didn't write the law, and she wasn't the president, so she didn't make the decisions,"" Littlefield told the Associated Press. ""But we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it."" Shortly after the legislation passed, the New York Times reported, ""Participants in the campaign for the health bill both on and off Capitol Hill said the first lady had played a crucial behind-the-scenes role in lining up White House support."" The Washington Post The Fact Checker examined her claim in an ad that she worked with Democrats and Republicans to get the law passed and concluded that was questionable. While she worked behind the scenes on the legislation, the Fact Checker wrote that there was no evidence she worked with members of both parties and instead worked with White House staff and Kennedy’s office -- not Hatch. ""The White House wasn't for it. We really roughed them up"" in trying to get it approved over the Clinton administration's objections, Hatch told the Boston Globe in 2008. ""She may have done some advocacy (privately) over at the White House, but I'm not aware of it. Hatch added ""I do like her,"" referring to Hillary Clinton. ""We all care about children. But does she deserve credit for SCHIP? No -- Teddy does, but she doesn't."" Our ruling Bill Clinton said Hillary Clinton sought to expand health care piecemeal including the ""Children's Health Insurance Program."" Clinton did work behind the scenes to create the program to offer healthcare to children. He avoided specifying how much credit she should get for that and whether she worked with both parties to make that happen.

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Barbara  Boxer']","
At DNC, Barbara Boxer says Trump said women should be 'punished' for abortion
","Women’s issues were a major theme of the Democratic National Convention’s second day — the same day the party officially nominated Hillary Clinton, making her the first female presidential nominee from a major party. Convention speakers contrasted Clinton with her opponent, Donald Trump, whose comments about women have been widely noted. ""Her opponent said a woman should be ‘punished’ for exercising her right to choose and then picked a running mate who believes Roe vs. Wade belongs, to quote him, ‘in the ash heap of history,' "" said California Sen. Barbara Boxer, speaking of Trump and his vice presidential pick Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. Trump’s position on abortion is hard to pin down. Throughout this election cycle, he has said he is against abortion, with exceptions. But in prior years, he has called himself ""very pro-choice."" So it’s easy for Trump’s opponents on either side of the issue to criticize his position. Along the same lines, Boxer’s claim that Trump said women should be ""punished"" for having an abortion is a selective reading of Trump’s comments, which have shifted. He did say that women should be punished for having an abortion, but he walked back his comments the very same day. ""He said it, she heard it,"" said Boxer Press Secretary Peter True.  What Trump said Trump made the comments at issue during a March 30, 2016, conversation with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews. Here are two relevant portions of the conversation. (Read more here.) MATTHEWS: ""No, should the woman be punished for having an abortion?"" TRUMP: ""Look..."" MATTHEWS: ""This is not something you can dodge."" TRUMP: ""It’s a — no, no..."" MATTHEWS: ""If you say abortion is a crime or abortion is murder, you have to deal with it under law. Should abortion be punished?"" TRUMP: ""Well, people in certain parts of the Republican Party and conservative Republicans would say, ‘yes, they should be punished.’ "" MATTHEWS: ""How about you?"" TRUMP: ""I would say that it’s a very serious problem. And it’s a problem that we have to decide on. It’s very hard."" … MATTHEWS: ""Do you believe in punishment for abortion, yes or no as a principle?"" TRUMP: ""The answer is that there has to be some form of punishment."" MATTHEWS: ""For the woman."" TRUMP: ""Yeah, there has to be some form."" MATTHEWS: ""Ten cents? Ten years? What?"" TRUMP: ""I don’t know. That I don’t know. That I don’t know."" The gist is that Trump said he believed there should be ""some form of punishment"" for the woman. But he quickly walked back those comments. What Trump said later After an outcry about his remarks that same day, Trump’s campaign released a statement saying he meant that the person who performed the abortion would face consequences if Congress passed a law banning the procedure. The statement read: ""If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman. The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb."" In a March 31 Fox News interview, Trump said it’s possible he ""misspoke"" in his conversation with Matthews, adding that it had been a ""convoluted discussion."" ""If, in fact, abortion was outlawed, the person performing the abortion, the doctor or whoever it may be that is really doing the act is responsible for the act, not the woman is responsible,"" Trump said. ""So, that's the way I have always felt."" As our friends at Snopes have noted, it’s not like Trump is or was a forceful advocate for punishing women for abortion who then flipped his position suddenly. Trump was responding to a hypothetical question that Matthews posed — a question he first tried to dodge — about laws banning abortion that don’t currently exist. He retracted the comment soon after. Our ruling Boxer said Trump ""said a woman should be punished for exercising her right to choose."" Trump did say something to this effect, but within a matter of hours, he clarified his comments. Trump said he meant doctors should be punished for providing abortions, not women who undergo the procedure. In rating this claim, we find Trump’s comments contradictory. Yes, he mentioned punishment, but his campaign retracted that statement. There’s no evidence this was a long-held position. Boxer’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6e3732c3-0674-40c9-b479-b615b7a35c81",/factchecks/2016/jul/27/barbara-boxer/dnc-barbara-boxer-says-trump-said-women-should-be-/
"['National', 'Human Rights', 'Crime', 'Amy Klobuchar']","
Yes, human trafficking ranks No. 3 in world crime
","Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., told delegates at the Democratic convention that Hillary Clinton showed compassion to the powerless across the world, especially victims of human trafficking. Klobuchar highlighted the enormous scope of the problem. ""Human trafficking is the third-biggest criminal enterprise in the world,"" she said. We found that comparison intriguing and looked into it. We reached out to Klobuchar’s office and did not hear back. From our research, the claim is plausible, with a significant caveat: It’s always enormously hard to put a dollar figure to illegal activity. However, most estimates suggest that drug trafficking is larger than all other crime. Whether human trafficking falls second or third is a matter of debate, but the consensus view is that it ranks in the top three. Definitions matter when talking about trafficking. The Government Accountability Office wrote that ""human trafficking involves the exploitation of a person typically through force, fraud or coercion for the purpose of forced labor, involuntary servitude or commercial sex."" This can take a number of forms. Desperate people might go into debt to smugglers who place them in jobs. Their only option is to work off that debt on terms dictated by their employer. They might be sold by their parents and have no money to get back home. Or they might be tricked into prostitution and find themselves living in the shadows of an illicit enterprise. The International Labor Organization, an arm of the United Nations, estimated the profits associated with human trafficking reached about $150 billion in 2012. Of that, about $100 billion was tied to sexual exploitation. How does that compare to money from illegal drugs? The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime tackled that question in 2011. Their rough estimate was that drugs accounted for about a fifth of all criminal proceeds worldwide, or about $420 billion. The research group Global Financial Integrity assessed all forms of transnational crime in 2011. Its report said that ""there is little doubt that, of all the illicit markets, the drug market is king."" It leaned toward a total value of $320 billion, but gave a nod to another report that put the range between $45 billion and $280 billion. The issue is simply a lack of consistent or comprehensive data. That report also looked at profits from counterfeiting, whether that is fake Rolex watches or fake $100 bills. It cited a crude estimate from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development of $250 billion. So where does that put human trafficking in the ranking? Without putting too much credence in the precision of any figure, human trafficking seems to come in third behind the drug trade and counterfeiting. A big red flag The International Labor Organization’s report is full of cautionary notes. ""In the case of forced sexual exploitation, information ... is unavailable because of the nature of the work,"" it said. A key formula in the report’s model is based on data from just seven countries — India, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya and Uganda. It identified three kinds of human trafficking, including forced labor, forced sexual exploitation, and state imposed forced labor. But to apply that breakdown across Asia, Latin America, the industrialized nations, Africa, the Middle East and Central Europe, it wrote ""in absence of more detailed information, this report assumes that the distribution of victims across the three forms ... is uniform across the regions."" At the end of the day, assumptions fill in missing data right and left. So no one should take these figures to the bank, but Dominique Roe-Sepowitz, a human trafficking researcher at Arizona State University, said that doesn’t mean they have no value. ""These are as good of an estimate as we know,"" Roe-Sepowitz said. ""There are so many curves and complexities in estimating the cost of human trafficking globally I don't think we can create a better estimate."" The same uncertainties apply to the estimated value of the drug and counterfeiting trade. Our ruling Klobuchar said that human trafficking is the third-biggest criminal enterprise in the world. A U.N. agency estimated the total value of human trafficking at $150 billion. The comparable estimates for the drug trade range from about $280 billion to $420 billion. There is one dicey estimate for counterfeiting of $250 billion. By those measures, human trafficking does rank third. However, all of these numbers hinge on sweeping assumptions and limited data. With that caveat in mind, we rank this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/jul/27/amy-klobuchar/yes-human-trafficking-ranks-3-world-crime/
"['Economy', 'Housing', 'California', 'Kevin de León']","
Does California really have the '6th largest economy on planet Earth?'
","UPDATE: Since publication, California’s economy moved up to the fifth largest in the world, according to data by the U.S. Department of Commerce and reported in May 2018 in the Sacramento Bee. Its 2017 GDP was $2.747 trillion, surpassing the United Kingdom’s $2.625 trillion GDP. State Senate leader Kevin de León spotlighted California’s economic and social achievements during his speech this week at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The Democrat from Los Angeles touted the state’s newly established $15 per hour minimum wage, efforts to keep college affordable and California’s hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs. ""We’ve made unprecedented progress in every area,"" De León told a cheering crowd. ""And when we elect Hillary Clinton as our next president, I know that our progress will be America’s progress."" The state senator then repeated a talking point California leaders love to make on national and international stages, about the size of the state’s economy: ""These are the progressive policies that have made California the sixth largest economy on planet Earth,"" De León said. We won’t wade into the debate over whether progressive or other policies have positioned the state’s economy on such a high perch. But we will examine the provocative ""sixth largest economy on planet Earth"" claim by itself.  State Senate leader Kevin de León makes the ""sixth largest economy"" claim at the 1:45 minute mark in this video. Our research State leaders have made this hypothetical comparison for years, examining California’s gross domestic product against nations across the globe. With nearly 40 million people, the state has a larger population than many countries. It also boasts a diverse set of industries from technology to tourism and entertainment. In June, Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration released figures showing California, with a GDP of more than $2.4 trillion in 2015 had jumped two spots in these unique world rankings ahead of France and Brazil and into sixth place behind the United Kingdom. First on the list is the United States, followed by China, Japan and Germany.  California’s place on the list has fluctuated over time. It had been 10th as recently as 2012 due to the effects of the financial and housing slumps. The rankings use International Monetary Fund data. California is the only state on the list of nations. Experts have said California’s rise in the rankings reflects its strong economic growth compared with the rest of the world. They have cited Silicon Valley’s continued tech boom as a critical factor. ""It speaks to California doing relatively well in a sluggish global economy,"" Jeff Michael, director of the University of the Pacific’s Center for Business and Policy Research, told the Sacramento Bee in June. A more complex picture De León’s statement, made in a short 4-minute speech, did not include much context. When adjusting for the state’s high cost of living, California’s GDP ranking drops to 11th in the world, according to the California Legislative Analyst’s Office.  A tweet on June 14, 2016 from the California's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office.  Carson Bruno, who studies California policy at the conservative Hoover Institution, says there’s a lot missing from the ""sixth largest economy claim."" In California, ""housing costs more; electricity and gas cost more; and even most goods and services cost more than the national average,"" he wrote in a post on RealClearMarkets.com. ""In many respects California's cost of living is much more like a Western European nation than it is like the rest of the U.S. The widely reported global rankings ignore this reality."" De León’s spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Our rating State Senate leader Kevin de León recently claimed at the Democratic National Convention that California has ""the sixth largest economy on planet Earth."" This hypothetical comparison rests on California’s $2.4 trillion GDP, which moved slightly above that of France and Brazil in 2015 to sixth in the world. The ranking, and De León’s statement, however, ignore California’s sky high cost of living and Silicon Valley’s role in the state’s economic growth. The state’s GDP drops several places when adjusted for cost of living. De León’s statement, while accurate, could have used this additional information or clarification.

Bernie Sanders' outdated income inequality statistic
","After a night of intermittent booing and heckling from disappointed progressives attending the first night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Bernie Sanders received a hero’s welcome and took the chance to remind his supporters of their political revolution’s real purpose. ""This election is about ending the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality that we currently experience, the worst it has been since 1928,"" Sander said. ""It is not moral, not acceptable and not sustainable that the top one-tenth of one percent now own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, or that the top 1 percent in recent years has earned 85 percent of all new income. That is unacceptable. That must change."" Sanders’ wealth claim, a favorite line from his stump speech, is largely accurate.  His claim about the uber wealthy hogging almost all of the new income, however, is out of date and exaggerated. A month before he launched his presidential campaign, Sanders made a version of the claim in an April 2015 interview with Fox News: ""99 percent of all new income today (is) going to the top 1 percent."" Back then, we rated the claim Mostly True, as Sanders’ figure was credible but not the only way to consider income inequality. (Some economists prefer to also factor in unemployment compensation, welfare and health benefits, Social Security, retirement income and health benefits.) According to University of California, Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez, the top 1 percent captured 91 percent of pre-tax, pre-transfer income from 2009 to 2012. For this fact-check, the Sanders campaign referred us to a study by the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute that concludes the top 1 percent got 85.1 percent of new income from 2009 to 2013. The trouble for Sanders: A lot has happened since 2013. And as the economy has improved, the income disparity has lessened. When Sanders made the same point at a Democratic debate in February 2016, we found more recent data from Saez. By 2014, the top 1 percent’s share of post-recession income dropped to a less egregious (albeit still disportionate) 58 percent — a figure that Sanders seems aware of. And last month, Saez updated his numbers again to include 2015 data, and the uber wealthy’s share decreased slightly again to 52 percent. ""In 2014 and especially in 2015, the incomes of bottom 99 percent families have finally started recovering in earnest from the losses of the Great Recession,"" Saez writes, adding that the recovery now looks ""much less lopsided"" even as income inequality remains extremely high. Here’s a breakdown:  Our ruling Sanders said, ""The top 1 percent in recent years has earned 85 percent of all new income."" That figure covers 2009 to 2013, but there’s data for even more recent years. Factoring in 2014 and 2015, the top 1 percent’s share in post-recession income falls to 52 percent. That’s still a big number, but not nearly what Sanders told convention delegates and a large television audience.

Corey Stewart misleadingly says Hillary Clinton, Ralph Northam 'label police as racists'
","Corey Stewart, Donald Trump’s Virginia campaign chairman, recently laid blame on Democrats for the July 7 sniper shootings that left five Dallas police officers dead and nine wounded. ""Liberal politicians who label police as racists - specifically Hillary Clinton and Virginia Lt. Governor Ralph Northam - are to blame for essentially encouraging the murder of these police officers tonight,"" Stewart, chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, wrote in a Facebook post shortly after midnight on July 8. We’re not fact-checking Stewart’s opinion that comments from ""liberal politicians"" triggered the Dallas shootings by a man who was upset by recent police killings of blacks in other cities. Our focus is investigating Stewart’s claim that Clinton and Northam have labeled police as racists. Stewart has rivalries with both Democrats. As Trump’s state chairman, he has a major role in trying to defeat Clinton this fall in Virginia. Next year, Stewart plans to seek the GOP gubernatorial nomination. That puts him at cross-purposes with Northam, who is the only announced Democratic gubernatorial candidate. Stewart doubled down on his statement in a follow-up Facebook post that said: ""Va. Lt. Governor Ralph Northam and Hillary Clinton are pitting minorities against the police. Whenever there is a police shooting involving a minority, their knee jerk reaction is to allege racism."" Trump’s campaign quickly distanced itself from Stewart’s statement that ""liberal politicians"" caused the Dallas shooting. ""Corey does not speak for the campaign, and this is not something we agree with,"" Hope Hicks, Trump’s campaign spokeswoman, told The New York Times. Stewart’s social media posts don’t cite any comments by Clinton or Northam. So we asked Stewart to point us to specific statements by the two Democrats that prove both ""label police as racists."" He declined our request. We also reached out to the Republican Party of Virginia, to see if it’s aware of any comments that would back Stewart’s claim. The party didn’t provide any. ""Not our statement,"" David D’Onofrio, a party spokesman, wrote in an email. So we looked on our own. Clinton After police fatally shot two black men this month - Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, La., and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minn. - Clinton tweeted, ""Alton Sterling Matters, Philando Castile Matters. Black Lives Matter."" She attached a statement to her tweet: ""Something is profoundly wrong when so many Americans have reason to believe that our country doesn’t consider them as precious as others because of the color of their skin."" In a Jan. 16 primary debate, NBC News anchor Lester Holt asked Clinton about the 2015 fatal shooting of Walter Scott, a black man who was running away from a police officer in North Charleston, S.C. ""We understand that a jury will decide whether that police officer was justified. But it played straight to the fears of many African-American men that their lives are cheap. Is that perception, or in your view is it reality?"" Holt asked. Clinton said that, sadly, that is a reality. ""There needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system,"" she said. ""And that requires a very clear agenda for retraining police officers, looking at ways to end racial profiling, finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief."" On the eve of South Carolina’s Democratic Primary in February, Clinton released a TV ad in which she lamented a ""fundamentally broken"" system where ""African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do."" Clinton said in the ad, ""We have to face up to the hard truth of injustice and systemic racism."" We asked Clinton’s campaign if it sees a distinction between her comments about ""systemic racism"" and Stewart’s claim that she labels police as racists. Sarah Peck, a Virginia spokeswoman for the campaign, sent us a series of Clinton statements this year voicing broad support for police officers. Here are a few: ""I think the vast majority of police officers in our country are serving honorably and bravely, and that’s why it’s very important we support their work. That we respect their service,"" Clinton said during a July 8 interview with ""ABC World News Tonight."" ""I think that most law enforcement is doing an excellent job. They are honorable, they’re working hard. But we don’t want to taint everybody with the problems that some have,"" she said during a Feb. 12 interview with WSPA-TV in Spartanburg, S.C. ""Now I think you know, because I sure believe, there are many police officers out there every day inspiring trust and confidence, putting themselves on the line to save lives. So let's learn from those who are doing it right and apply those lessons across the country,"" she said during a Feb. 16 speech in Harlem, N.Y. Clinton has called for improved police training to combat ""implicit bias."" She also wants to create federal matching grants to help police forces buy body cameras to protect officers from unfair accusations and suspects from mistreatment. Northam Contrary to Stewart’s claim, we couldn’t find any comments by the lieutenant governor that even remotely accused police of racism. We searched the archives of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, The Washington Post, The Virginian-Pilot, The Roanoke Times and the Daily Press. We also combed through Northam’s website, his Facebook page and Twitter pages for the lieutenant governor’s office and Northam’s gubernatorial campaign. The only Northam statement we found on the violence was released shortly after the Dallas shootings and expressed grief felt by the lieutenant governor and his wife. ""Pam and I are heartbroken over the horrific violence against the police in Dallas,"" Northam said in the written statement. ""With so much violence and tragedy in Dallas, Minneapolis, and Baton Rouge, this is a time for our nation to come together and heal. Having cared for those who are wounded in service of our country, I know the sacrifice these officers make and my prayers are with the victims, their families, all first responders and all communities affected by violence."" Alexsis Rodgers, Northam’s policy director and spokeswoman, told us the lieutenant governor’s office is perplexed by Stewart’s claim. Our ruling Stewart said that Hillary Clinton and Ralph Northam ""label police as racists."" He declined to offer any statements by the two Democrats that would back his claim. Clinton has said racial profiling needs to end and that law enforcement needs to confront ""systemic racism"" in the criminal justice system. That lends an element of truth to Stewart’s statement, but it’s a far cry from Clinton labeling all police as racists. Clinton has said repeatedly that the actions of a few officers shouldn’t taint all law enforcement officers. With Northam, we can’t find any statement that supports Stewart’s incendiary claim, and Stewart dodges his burden of proof. All told, we rate Stewart’s statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6eabf830-e0ae-41a5-9009-62513628fbe5",/factchecks/2016/jul/26/corey-stewart/corey-stewart-wrongly-says-hillary-clinton-ralph-n/

Rep. Gutierrez says fewer people crossing border than in last 30 years
","U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., used his speech at the opening night of the Democratic National Convention to be an advocate for immigrants, saying they work, pay taxes and defend democracy. Gutierrez continued to press the message in an interview with Fox News host Bill O’Reilly from the floor of the Wells Fargo Center. ""We could solve the problem tomorrow because there are good men and women in the Republican party who can work with good men and women in the Democratic party,"" Gutierrez said. ""Look Bill, there are fewer people crossing that border than in the last 30 years. We've already doubled the enforcement on the border."" This fact-check will examine his statement that border crossings are at a 30-year low. U.S. Border Patrol border apprehension data serves as a way to gauge illegal immigration patterns, though it’s difficult to say for certain how many have tried crossing the border. ""If they are crossing without anyone noticing, then we have to make assumptions based on what can be measured,"" said Audrey Singer, a senior fellow in the Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center at the Urban Institute, in an interview. Two ways to measure is by looking at border apprehensions and by making estimates based on on the number living in the U.S. as a proxy for the size of the flow, she said A spokesman for Gutierrez directed us to recent research published by Pew Research Center saying that the number of Mexican immigrants apprehended at U.S. borders in fiscal 2015 was the lowest in nearly 50 years. U.S. Border Patrol data tallying ""illegal alien apprehensions"" by fiscal year (Oct. 1 through Sept. 30) shows a total of 337,117 immigrants were apprehended in fiscal year 2015, including 331,333 at the southwest border. Border Patrol data going back to apprehensions nationwide since fiscal 1925 shows that apprehensions in fiscal 2015 were the lowest since at least the early 1970s. But numbers at the southwest border actually dipped a few years ago. Southwest border apprehensions were lower in fiscal year 2011 at 327,577 --- about 3,756 fewer people than were apprehended at that border in fiscal 2015. Some researchers offered Gutierrez the benefit of the doubt. ""Given the uncertain ratio between apprehensions and actual crossings, it would be fair to call 2015 and 2011 a statistical ‘tie’,"" said Jacob L. Vigdor, a Daniel J. Evans professor at the Evans School of Public Policy and Governance at the University of Washington. Before 2011, the lowest number of apprehensions was in 1972, at 321,326. Steven Camarota, director of research at Center for Immigration Studies, says there really is no way to know for sure if the number of people illegally crossing the border is less than in the last 30 years, as Gutierrez said. He says apprehensions are a weak way to measure new illegal immigration because it doesn’t count visa overstays or people using border crossing cards. The number of non-Mexican apprehensions, which used to be very small, has also increased and offset declines in immigration from Mexico, he said. Data collected by the Census Bureau shows 3.1 million new immigrants settled in the United States in 2014 and 2015 (legally and illegally). Our ruling Gutierrez said, ""There are fewer people crossing that border than in the last 30 years"" while discussing border security. While there’s no definite way to count all immigrants who try to cross U.S. borders, many immigration scholars use border patrol apprehension data as the basis for their assessments. Historically, Border Patrol data for apprehensions nationwide shows that apprehensions in fiscal year 2015 were the lowest since at least the early 1970s. There was one year with fewer apprehensions at the southwest border than 2015 -- the 2011 fiscal year, which had about 3,756 fewer stops than 2015. With that caveat, the point about the larger immigration trend is accurate. We rate Gutierrez’ statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/jul/26/luis-gutierrez/rep-gutierrez-says-fewer-people-crossing-border-la/

Elizabeth Warren says Donald Trump was excited for 2008 housing crash
","Sen. Elizabeth Warren's speech at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia was designed, in part, to convince Americans that the Republican nominee Donald Trump was no friend of the average person. Warren said Democrats fought to get health insurance for more Americans, refinance student loans, end tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas, raise the minimum wage and create a strong consumer agency ""so big banks can't cheat people."" ""Where was Donald Trump? In all these fights, not once did he lift a finger to help working people,"" she said. ""Look at his history,"" Warren continued. ""Donald Trump said he was excited for the 2008 housing crash that devastated millions of American families, because he thought it would help him scoop up more real estate on the cheap."" She was referring to the Great Recession, in which the housing mortgage crisis played a major role. Did Trump really get excited when the 2008 housing occurred because he saw it as a business opportunity? We touched on this before when Hillary Clinton claimed in a television commercial that ""In 2006, Donald Trump was hoping for a real estate crash."" We ruled that claim Mostly True. But this claim is different. Warren's statement suggests that Trump was excited for the crash after it happened or while it was happening. But the only evidence we've seen predates the worst of the recession. We asked Warren's spokeswoman for evidence but didn't hear back. Here's what we know. The Trump statement in partly question is rooted in an audiobook How to Build a Fortune, created as part of Trump University, the controversial project that promised to have Trump teach enrollees how to become wealthy. It has been the subject of three lawsuits from former ""students"" who allege they were ripped off by the billionaire. The audiobook is from 2006, when it was not obvious that the real estate market was about to tank but there was concern that inflated prices had produced a bubble that might burst, dropping values. In the recording, Trump is being interviewed. He's asked, ""There's a lot of talk, which you've no doubt heard too, about a so-called real estate bubble. What's your take on that pessimism?"" ""Well first of all, I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy,"" Trump responded. ""You know, if you're in a good cash position — which I'm in a good cash position today — then people like me would go in and buy like crazy."" ""If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you can make a lot of money,"" he said in the section posted by CNN. However, Trump immediately added: ""At the same time, I don't think that (real estate bubble burst) will happen because if interest rates stay fairly low, if the dollar stays pretty much where it is or even goes a little bit higher, but basically if you have a weak dollar, this is tremendous amounts of money pouring in, so I don't think that's going to happen. I'm not a believer that the interest market, that the real estate market, is going to take a big hit."" So Trump didn't think the crash was going to happen. The only other piece of evidence we've seen: A year later, in 2007, Trump told the Toronto Globe and Mail that he was ready to invest in real estate because the market was starting to head down. ""People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I'm excited if it is,"" he told the paper. ""I've always made more money in bad markets than in good markets."" But once again, it's clear that Trump wasn't predicting the scope of the housing crisis. ""Donald Trump almost lost his shirt 15 years ago when the North American real estate bubble burst,"" the story begins. ""The 2007 version of that disaster will be much more benign, the real estate magnate predicts. . .  'We're talking very minor (problems) compared with the depression of the early 1990s,' Mr. Trump said."" The Globe and Mail story said he was advising investors to take advantage of the situation by buying subprime mortgages at a discount and repossessed houses at low prices. It's all part of the philosophy that any wise investor uses: buy low and sell high. The Trump campaign did not respond to our request for reaction to Warren's statement. Our ruling Warren said, ""Donald Trump said he was excited for the 2008 housing crash that devastated millions of American families, because he thought it would help him scoop up more real estate on the cheap."" We haven't seen any evidence that Trump said he was excited about the crash once it happened, and Warren's office did not provide any. However, the existing evidence predates 2008, and it shows that Trump didn't think a crash was going to happen at all. He did make it clear that he would try to take advantage of a downturn in the housing market, but any good investor would try to do that. Warren’s statement puts Trump’s comments in the wrong context, but she has a point about his buying philosophy. Warren's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e349a2cd-2c08-4616-9147-8f8045f5dcdb",/factchecks/2016/jul/26/elizabeth-warren/elizabeth-warren-says-donald-trump-was-excited-200/

RNC is right that no Democratic speaker mentioned ISIS on convention's first night
","Night one of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia had barely ended when the Republican National Committee sent a blast email to reporters attacking the Democrats for ignoring the threat of terrorism when speaking at the podium. ""61: Number Of Speeches At The DNC Tonight,"" the Republican National Committee wrote. ""0: Mentions Of The Global Terrorist Threat Posed By ISIS."" Was the Democratic discussion of ISIS and Islamic terrorism that thin? Basically, yes. It’s worth noting that the first night was not intended to have a specific focus on foreign policy,  leaving the Democrats with three days left to discuss the issue. And Hillary Clinton -- away from the podium in Philadelphia -- issued a fairly muscular call for action against ISIS at the annual Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Charlotte, N.C. ""We have to protect ourselves against terrorists,"" Clinton told the group. ""To do that, we need to lead other countries in stopping ISIS, al-Qaida, and other radical jihadist groups. We shouldn’t leave that to the rest of the world to figure out on their own. That won’t keep us safe."" That said, as it concerns the convention in Philadelphia, the RNC’s statement is literally correct. Based on our searches of C-SPAN closed-captioning text, Congressional Quarterly transcripts and other video archiving services, we couldn’t find any speaker who mentioned ""ISIS,"" ""Islamic"" ""terror,"" ""terrorist,"" or ""terrorism"" during the first day of the convention. The closest example came in a video that quoted Hillary Clinton’s speech after the mass shooting in Orlando in which a gunman who professed allegiance to ISIS attacked a gay nightclub. ""From Stonewall to Laramie, and now Orlando, we've seen too many examples of how the struggle to live freely, openly and without fear has been met by violence. We have to stand together, be proud together. There is no better rebuke to the terrorists and all those who hate,"" she said. But that doesn’t really fit the description in the RNC’s email, since the email referred to speeches at the Democratic convention, not to video footage shown of Clinton’s past speeches. Our ruling The Republican National Committee said speakers at the Democratic National Convention made ""zero mentions of the global terrorist threat posed by ISIS."" While Clinton took the opportunity to bring up the topic at an appearance in Charlotte on the same day, the email accurately reflects what was said -- or more precisely, not said -- from the podium in Philadelphia.

At DNC, Bernie Sanders repeats claim that top one-tenth of 1% owns as much wealth as bottom 90%
","Now that the Democratic primary is over, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ speeches have a new feature: an enthusiastic endorsement of Hillary Clinton. But he’s still reciting his favorite stump speech lines about income inequality that he used throughout his campaign. ""It is not moral, it is not acceptable, and it is not sustainable that the top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent,"" he said at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia July 25. That statistic is a classic Sanders line — one we’ve looked at twice before. It rates Mostly True, and here’s why. Sanders’ source is a wealth inequality study released in October 2014, produced for the nonpartisan National Bureau of Economic Research. The study’s authors were economists Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, and Gabriel Zucman of the London School of Economics. They based their wealth estimates on 2012 tax records. The study found that, as Sanders claimed, the top 0.1 percent and the bottom 90 percent of U.S. households own virtually the same share of all the nation's wealth. The top 0.1 percent was composed of 160,000 families with average wealth of $72.8 million. All told, they owned 22 percent of the nation’s wealth. Meanwhile, the bottom 90 percent included 144 million families with average wealth of $84,000, and they owned an equal 22.8 percent of America’s wealth. ""Wealth is getting more concentrated in the United States,"" the researchers observed, ""but this phenomenon largely owes to the spectacular dynamics of fortunes of dozens and hundreds of million dollars, and much less to the growth in fortunes of a few million dollars. Inequality within rich families is increasing."" Two other prominent economists — Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics and Edward Wolff of New York University — told PolitiFact Wisconsin that the study makes solid estimates about wealth inequality. Wolff said he was not aware of another study that examined the wealth of the top 0.1 percent. But other economists have some noted some concerns with the study’s findings. Richard Burkhauser, a professor of policy analysis at Cornell University, told PolitiFact Wisconsin that although the study’s authors are ""very well respected economists,"" he has a major complaint: it excludes Social Security. ""To ignore it as they do grossly understates the wealth held by Americans in the bottom 99 percent of the population,""  Burkhauser said. Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, said another flaw is that the study doesn’t take into account certain features in the tax law. For example, the way capital income is reported on taxes for higher-income taxpayers versus middle-income taxpayers could skew the results. ""Even if one makes the heroic assumption that the data is completely accurate, our friends on the left take these numbers and want people to believe that the wealth of the top 1 percent (or top 10 percent, or top .01 percent, etc) comes at the expense of the rest of us,"" Mitchell said. ""This is generally nonsense. People such as Bill Gates become rich because they generate real value for others. There is no fixed pie."" Our ruling Sanders said, ""The top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent."" His claim repeats a finding from a study by two internationally respected economists, and others back up the study’s results. But the study has been criticized, for example, for not including Social Security in the wealth calculations. Sanders’ claim is accurate but needs additional context, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/jul/26/bernie-sanders/dnc-bernie-sanders-repeats-claim-top-one-tenth-1-o/

Sanders: Trump would allow states to lower the minimum wage
","Donald Trump is a huge fan of the word ""huge."" At the Democratic convention, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders relished the chance to turn the word against the GOP nominee. ""While Donald Trump believes in huge tax breaks -- huuuuge tax breaks  -- for billionaires, he believes that states should actually have the right to lower the minimum wage below $7 and a quarter,"" Sanders said. Trump’s stance on the federal minimum wage – it’s currently $7.25 – has been a moving target, and we’ve done our best to track it. Sanders’ charge lines up most closely with what Trump said during a May 8, 2016, interview on NBC’s Meet the Press. Host Chuck Todd aimed to clarify Trump’s views. Here’s the key exchange: Todd: ""Should the federal government set a floor, and then you let the states --"" Trump: ""No, I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck. So I like the idea of let the states decide. But I think people should get more. I think they're out there. They're working. It is a very low number. You know, with what's happened to the economy, with what's happened to the cost. I mean, it's just -- I don't know how you live on $7.25 an hour. But I would say let the states decide."" So while Trump voiced sympathy for low-wage workers, he rejected the idea that Washington should set a minimum and carried it further to say that states should use the wage ""to compete with each other."" If Trump had expressed that policy consistently, there would be no debate on his views. But here are other excerpts from Trump on the minimum wage: • In an interview with MSNBC in August 2015, Trump said, ""Having a low minimum wage is not a bad thing for this country."" • During the Republican debate in Milwaukee in November 2015, Trump said wages are ""too high"" and, when asked whether he would raise the minimum wage, said, ""I would not do it."" • On ABC’s This Week on May 8, 2016, host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump, ""Minimum wage -- all through the primaries, you were against an increase. Now you're saying you're looking at it. So what's your bottom line on this?"" Trump responded, ""Well, I am looking at it and I haven't decided in terms of numbers. But I think people have to get more."" When Stephanopoulos asked whether that’s a change, Trump answered, ""Well, sure it's a change. I'm allowed to change. You need flexibility."" Looking at all his statements, we see that most of the time Trump says that he would like to see people earning more than the current minimum wage. But on the separate issue of whether Washington should mandate a hike, he is at best ambivalent, and more often than not, he opposes that. Our ruling Sanders said that Trump believes that states should have the right to lower the minimum wage. Looking strictly at Trump’s words, at one point, in that Meet the Press interview, he said states should have the right to set their own minimum wage and rejected the idea that the federal government should set it for the country. The only quibble with Sanders’ statement is he talked about what Trump believes, as if Trump’s policy is fixed and steady. It isn’t that simple. Trump suggested in one interview that he might consider raising the federal minimum wage. But most of the time, he has not expressed that view. Nor has Trump said anything recently to clarify his position. Taking Trump’s ambiguity into account, we rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2d3f300b-aebb-4aae-b6a1-8a33626d6a60",/factchecks/2016/jul/26/bernie-sanders/sanders-trump-would-allow-states-lower-minimum-wag/

She did this by citing her own residence for the past eight years as an example of how far her country had come. ""I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves,"" she said. ""And I watch my daughters, two beautiful, intelligent, black young women, playing with their dogs on the White House lawn. And because of Hillary Clinton, my daughters and all our sons and daughters now take for granted that a woman can be president of the United States.

Here, we’ll take a look at whether the first lady was correct that the White House ""was built by slaves."" The White House Historical Association -- a private preservation and educational group for the presidential residence complex -- has a web page devoted to the question, ""Did slaves build the White House?"" It reads in part: ""Construction on the president's house began in 1792 in Washington, D.C., a new capital situated in a sparsely settled region far from a major population center. The decision to place the capital on land ceded by two slave states -- Virginia and Maryland -- ultimately influenced the acquisition of laborers to construct its public buildings. ""The D.C. commissioners, charged by Congress with building the new city under the direction of the president, initially planned to import workers from Europe to meet their labor needs. However, response to recruitment was dismal and soon they turned to African American(s) — enslaved and free — to provide the bulk of labor that built the White House, the United States Capitol, and other early government buildings."" A stonemason, Collen Williamson, ""trained enslaved people on the spot at the government's quarry at Aquia, Va.,"" the group wrote. ""Enslaved people quarried and cut the rough stone that was later dressed and laid by Scottish masons to erect the walls of the president's house. The slaves joined a workforce that included local white laborers and artisans from Maryland and Virginia, as well as immigrants from Ireland, Scotland, and other European nations.""  These payroll records show that the government did not own slaves, but that it did hire them. Slave carpenters Ben, Daniel, and Peter were noted as being owned by James Hoban. (National Archives and Records Administration/White House Historical Association) Journalist Jesse J. Holland also discussed the role of slaves in building the White House in his 2016 book, The Invisibles: The Untold Story of African American Slaves in the White House. ""With the invention of steam shovels still several years away, these slaves dug for the clay on site with hand shovels, working day and night to get the raw material to the skilled brick makers and at the same time, opening up ground on the site for the space that would become the White House’s foundation and cellar,"" Holland wrote. The identity of these slaves and where they came from has been lost, he wrote. Obama’s statement is ""true,"" Holland told PolitiFact. Our rating Obama said the White House ""was built by slaves."" Strictly speaking, the White House was not exclusively built by slaves; it was built by a combination of slaves, free blacks and whites. But slaves were significantly involved in the construction of the White House, so we have no quarrel with the way Obama worded her claim.

Fact-checking the Funny Or Die video about Trump-brand products made overseas
","Bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States is a cornerstone of Donald Trump’s campaign. But comedy actor Ken Jeong and former White House economist Austan Goolsbee pointed out an apparent hypocrisy in a Funny Or Die video shown at the Democratic National Convention: Many Trump-branded products are made overseas. The video starts out with Jeong praising Trump’s businesses: ""Yeah, you make stuff right here!"" Then Goolsbee, who served in President Barack Obama’s administration responds, ""He didn’t do that."" Goolsbee and Jeong then go through a series of Trump-brand products — shirts, neckties, suits, cufflinks, vodka and glassware — to see where they were made. By the end, an exasperated Jeong says, ""So Austan, if that is your real name, Donald Trump says he would bring back jobs to America when he himself made millions outsourcing his own Donald Trump stuff to be made everywhere else."" ""That is a pretty astute observation, Ken."" We decided to go through their list of Trump products and check the ""made in"" labels. We found many of the products through Trump’s website, which has a page for the Donald J. Trump Collection, which includes suits, accessories and eyewear. We then explored the country for origin for each one. Claim: Trump shirts are made in Bangladesh. We found Trump shirts on Amazon that were made in Bangladesh and China, as well as some listed simply as ""imported."" Claim: Trump neckties are made in China. We saw a ""made in China"" label on a Trump tie for sale on eBay. Claim: Trump suits are made in Mexico. We actually found quite a few Trump suits on Amazon that were made in the United States. But we also found ones made in India and China. We couldn’t immediately find an example of a suit made in Mexico for sale, but Trump has acknowledged he has made some of his clothing line there. (Update: After we published this fact-check, the Clinton campaign sent us an example of an individual who posted a picture on Facebook of a Trump suit with a ""made in Mexico"" label. Claim: Trump cufflinks are made in China. We found some cufflinks that were made in China and others listed as imported. Claim: Trump Vodka is made in the Netherlands. Yes, Trump Vodka was distilled there, according to online liquor sellers. Claim: Trump crystal barware is made in Slovenia. Slovenian glassware producer Steklarna Rogaška partnered with Trump to sell their product under his name in the United States. Trump’s wife is also from Slovenia, which prompted Jeong to cry out her name: ""Holy Melania!"" But not all Trump products are made overseas. In a previous fact check, we found Trump-brand bedding, cologne, Trump Natural Spring Water and Trump Wine are all made in the United States. And if you’re wondering, some Trump products also are made in the United States, including the candidate’s iconic ""Make America Great Again"" baseball cap, which is manufactured in California. We gave a Pants on Fire rating in October to a claim made by Twitter users that the hats were made in China. It’s worth noting, too, that 97 percent of all clothes sold in the United States are made overseas, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association. Our ruling The Funny or Die video said Trump shirts are made in Bangladesh, Trump suits in Mexico, Trump Vodka in the Netherlands, Trump crystal barware in Slovenia and his cufflinks and ties in China. We found examples of all of these products made in the countries Jeong and Goolsbee mentioned, with the exception of a suit made in Mexico.

Yes, the United States is the only industrialized nation without paid family leave
","New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand put Hillary Clinton’s stance on women’s issues front and center at the first night of the Democratic National Convention. Gillibrand offered Clinton as a person who would bring America into the 21st century, and played off a popular television series about advertising executives in the 1960s where women were relegated to making coffee. ""Our policies are stuck in the Mad Men era,"" she said. ""We are the only industrialized nation that does not guarantee workers paid family leave. Many women can't even get a paid day off to give birth."" Gillibrand’s comparison of America to the rest of the industrialized nations is a familiar Democratic talking point. Bernie Sanders has said it. So has President Barack Obama. Twice. The claim rates Mostly True, and here’s why. What America has Under the Family Medical Leave Act, employers with 50 or more workers must allow parents 12 weeks of job-protected leave annually to care for a newborn. While this means those individuals can take the time off without fear of losing their job, in most cases the leave is unpaid. There are a couple of exceptions. California, New Jersey and Rhode Island offer paid family leave through employee-paid payroll taxes. Some employers choose to provide paid maternity leave, but that touches only about 13 percent of workers according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. What other countries have The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development studied paid maternity leave for about 34 OECD countries -- advanced nations -- and seven additional European Union countries. On average across OECD countries, mothers are entitled to 17 weeks of paid maternity leave. The United States is the only country with no national law to provide that benefit. According to the International Labor Organization, an agency of the United Nations, the United States and New Guinea are the two countries out of 170 that provide no cash benefits of any kind to women during maternity leave. Of the 41 other developed countries highlighted by the report, the United States also mandates the shortest period of time off — 12 weeks. Parents do particularly well in Australia and the United Kingdom, where they are eligible for a full year, although not all of that is paid leave. The main caveat when looking at other nations is that some of them limit who is eligible. In Canada, temporary workers can’t get cash benefits. Canada also excludes migrant workers and people who own more than 40 percent of their business. Norway and Switzerland exclude home workers, and some civil servants don’t get any benefits in Japan. The International Labor Organization sets a standard for what countries should provide in a benefits package: 1) Women should receive at least 14 weeks off; 2) They should be reimbursed at least two-thirds of their previous earnings; and 3) The benefit should be paid almost entirely by the state through public funds or Social Security. The United States is the only developed country to meet none of the benchmarks (and one of just 14 studied worldwide that didn’t check off any of the three). But six other countries fall short of at least one goal. Our ruling Gillibrand said that America is the only industrialized that doesn't guarantee workers paid family leave. If you don’t live in one of two states that require paid family leave, or work for an employer that voluntarily offers it, you can take time off when a little one arrives, but you won’t get paid. All other developed countries surveyed by the International Labor Organization mandate at least some paid maternity leave. Another international study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found the same thing. There are some exclusions and limits in some countries, so the benefit is not universal. On balance, the statement holds up and we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a1644f61-7467-4b83-bced-b2c7ac9f3126",/factchecks/2016/jul/26/kirsten-gillibrand/yes-us-only-industrialized-nation-without-paid-fam/

Does Donald Trump want to privatize the VA?
","For all of Donald Trump’s talk about veterans, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said he doesn’t have their backs. Kaine, Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential pick, blasted Trump on MSNBC for his ""not a war hero"" comments about John McCain, his delay in donating to veterans charities, and his ideas for fixing the Veterans Administration. ""Donald Trump is a guy who has called for privatization of the V.A.,"" Kaine said July 11. ""That is something that is overwhelmingly rejected by America's veterans. They do not want to go down that path. Do they want improvement? Sure they do. But they don't want risky or radical."" To back up his claim, the Kaine camp pointed to Trump’s campaign page on V.A. reforms and articles suggesting privatization is among them. But the Trump campaign told us Trump’s plan simply gives veterans a choice, and that’s not the same thing as privatization. While Trump wants to give veterans access to health providers outside the V.A. system, Kaine is being overly simplistic by suggesting Trump wants to turn over the whole thing to the private sector. What Trump proposed Trump’s VA plans include some elements of privatization, but it isn’t an outright overhaul of the existing system. At an October 2015 rally in Virginia, Trump said even though some candidates want to get rid of the V.A. (possibly referring to Ben Carson’s proposals to give veterans health savings accounts) he wants to ""supplement"" the existing V.A. system for veterans. ""No, it doesn’t have to be privatization,"" Trump said at a May 2016 press conference. ""What it has to be is when somebody is online and they say it’s a seven-day wait, that person’s going to walk across the street to a private doctor, be taken care of, we’re gonna pay the bill."" Nowhere on his position page or in his July 2016 Virginia Beach speech on veterans issues does Trump propose privatizing the V.A. Instead, he seeks to modernize it, crack down on inefficiency and abuse, and provide more care for female vets and those in in rural areas. He does, however, propose a veterans ID card for use outside of the V.A. system on his campaign website: ""Under a Trump Administration, all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteran’s ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately. ...The power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veterans’ health care dollars."" Similarly, Trump floated the idea in his speech in Virginia: ""We are going to ensure every veteran in America has the choice to seek care at the V.A., or to seek private medical care paid for by our government."" According to the Trump campaign, this is essentially the recommendation of the bipartisan federal Commission on Care, but with more choice in doctors. But veterans groups (many of which support the commission’s recommendations) told us that’s not an entirely accurate comparison. In short, the commission plan folds private health care providers into the V.A. system, while the Trump plan allows veterans to opt out of it. In its 300-page report, the commission emphasized that the V.A. should have oversight over an integrated health care network by vetting, training and coordinating with private sector doctors and clinics that qualify for participation. Trump’s plan, again, gives veterans access to all Medicare providers, but it doesn’t specify that these non-V.A. doctors would have to coordinate or meet the standards of the V.A. The I.D. card proposal also bears some resemblance to the Veterans Choice program, a law sponsored by John McCain that gives veterans access to community providers if they’ve been waiting for more than 30 days for V.A. care or if they live more than 40 miles away from a V.A. facility. Trump’s plan would essentially get rid of these eligibility requirements. Trump advisor Sam Clovis did tell the Wall Street Journal the candidate might model V.A. care after Medicare (like an insurance provider), as the Kaine campaign pointed out, but Clovis also said Trump ""doesn’t want to take away the veterans hospitals and the things that are working out."" Not exactly privatization Veterans group agreed that Trump’s I.D. card plan would lead to more privatized care, but were divided on whether Kaine’s characterization of Trump’s plan was accurate. Paralyzed Veterans of America’s executive director Sherman Gillums Jr. criticized Trump’s proposal for ""completely privatizing"" the V.A. in a press release, but praised Trump’s attention to veterans issues. AMVETS spokesman John Hoellwarth called the proposal ""well-intentioned,"" but agreed that it was privatization and would be disastrous. ""Encouraging all veterans to seek care in the private sector, which lacks the expertise to treat military and combat injuries and illnesses, and which does not typically provide integrated or coordinated care, would lead to worse health outcomes for many veterans,"" Hoellwarth said. Veterans of Foreign Wars, meanwhile, considers the Trump’s idea partial privatization. ""Our concern is that a ‘go anywhere card’ leads to veterans receiving fragmented, uncoordinated, and lower-quality care, which is not what veterans have earned and deserve,"" said Joe Davis, the group’s director of public affairs. ""Private sector health care must complement, not compete with or supplant the VA health care system."" On the other end, Dan Caldwell, vice president for political and legislative action at Concerned Veterans for America (which is backed by the anti-Trump Koch brothers) said the group supports both choice and integration and disagreed vehemently with Kaine’s characterization.   ""Giving veterans the choice of where to use their VA benefits does not necessitate the sale of VA hospitals to corporations nor does it eliminate government control of veterans’ health care,"" Caldwell said. ""Calling expanded health care choice for veterans ‘privatization’ is simply a poll-tested scare tactic."" Our ruling Kaine said, ""Donald Trump is a guy who has called for privatization of the V.A."" Actually, Trump is a guy who has called for giving veterans access to private providers. That may lead some veterans to seek care outside the V.A., but it’s not the same thing as completely privatizing the system.

No, Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders wouldn't have won even if super delegates were nixed
","Donald Trump fired off a series of tweets about Bernie Sanders over the weekend, at times commiserating with the senator over their shared disdain for the ""rigged"" political system and at others attacking Sanders for giving into it by endorsing Hillary Clinton. The Republican nominee commented on Wikileaks’ release of Democratic National Committee emails in which officials appear to have, among other things, mused over questioning Sanders’ religion and attacked campaign manager Jeff Weaver.  ""An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates,"" he tweeted. This last Trump tweet piqued our interest. Would it really be Sanders accepting the nomination this week at the DNC if not for superdelegates? Superdelegates, if you’ll remember from our primer, are the party officials and bigshots who make up about one-sixth of the delegates in the Democratic Party’s system. Under the rules that governed this year’s primaries, the superdelegates weren’t bound to the voting results in their state and could vote for whomever they wish. Many superdelegates backed Clinton before voting even began, and she commanded a disproportionate lead in superdelegates throughout the primaries, eliciting many cries of unfairness and cronyism from voters and Sanders supporters.   But Trump is wrong. Sanders would not have won the primary without these party insiders. The Trump campaign didn’t get back to us, but the ""analysis"" he may have been referring to could be a blog post on Gateway Pundit, a conservative newsblog. The post’s headline is ""NOTE TO SANDERS SUPPORTERS: Bernie Would Have Won If Not for Super Delegate System!"" It makes a flawed argument that Sanders would have nabbed the nomination if all of the Clinton superdelegates backed him instead.   That math checks out on paper, but it is nonsensical in reality.  The post offers no rationale for why the superdelegates should flip their votes against the popular vote (Clinton won 3.8 million more than Sanders). Experts told PolitiFact Florida that superdelegates could have played a difference if the race was closer. And to top it off, Sanders himself repeatedly advocated for superdelegates to follow the will of their state’s voters. In other scenarios, such as binding superdelegates to their state’s vote proportionally or taking them out of the system all together, Sanders would have still been unable to reach the magical 2,383-threshold of delegates needed to capture the nomination and would still trail Clinton. Here’s a breakdown of how many superdelegates Clinton and Sanders would have received under different primary systems, based on Green Papers’ superdelegate count. Clinton Total (superdelegates) Sanders Total (superdelegates) Without superdelegates (Trump suggestion) 2,200 1,831 With unbound superdelegates (current system) 2,771 (571) 1,875 (44) With winner-take-all superdelegates 2,721 (521) 2,019 (188) With proportional allocation of superdelegates 2,590 (390) 2,150 (319) (A note about our delegate methodology: Delegate counts vary from publication to publication, so we used Real Clear Politics and Green Papers, sources listed by the Gateway Pundit blog post. While RCP offers a superdelegate count, it does not offer state-by-state breakdowns so we referred to Green Papers for its superdelegate breakdown.) The bottom line: Binding the superdelegates to the winner of their state’s primary or caucus would have closed the delegate gap between Clinton and Sanders, but it wouldn’t have been enough for Sanders to win. Our ruling Trump tweeted, ""An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates."" This does not check out. Sanders would have still lost without superdelegates in the mix, because Clinton won a majority of the popular vote and pledged delegates. On the contrary, the only way for Sanders to have won is he would have been able to persuade more superdelegates to switch their votes from Clinton to him. We rate Trump’s claim False.",/factchecks/2016/jul/25/donald-trump/no-donald-trump-bernie-sanders-wouldnt-have-won-ev/

Tim Canova attacks Debbie Wasserman Schultz's record on Big Sugar
","A nasty-looking toxic algae bloom on Florida’s coasts has oozed into political races, including U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s Democratic primary. Her opponent, Tim Canova, toured the mucky scene in Stuart wearing a surgical mask. He says that Wasserman Schultz shares in the blame for the algae that extends from Lake Okeechobee to Florida coastlines on the Treasure Coast and west coast. Canova said Wasserman Schultz, who represents South Florida, has sided with the main polluters of the water that flows into the Everglades: the sugar industry. Wasserman Schultz doesn’t ""want us to know that she has voted for huge subsidies for the sugar industry and other agribusinesses, as well as for delays in cleanups, while failing to deliver federal funds for any real solution,"" he said on Medium July 9. Wasserman Schultz defended her environmental record to the Sun Sentinel, concluding, ""I will continue to walk the walk on fighting to restore our precious River of Grass while my opponent just continues to talk."" Time for PolitiFact Florida to weigh in. Algae and Big Sugar Everybody agrees that the algae is bad for the environment and business. But they disagree on who is to blame. Pollution from fertilizer, manure and septic waste from suburbs and farms poured into Lake Okeechobee. That pollution stimulated the growth of algae, so when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released water from the lake to avoid a breach of the surrounding dike, the algae-ridden water traveled to other waters in Florida. Some politicians blame the federal government for the water release as well as its failure to raise the dike. Others blame the state of Florida for siding with the sugar industry and resisting calls to redirect water through sugar land. In Florida, Big Sugar has given generously to state and local politicians and to federal candidates, including Wasserman Schultz. ""The sugar industry is completely ambidextrous as far as its ability to penetrate the Republican and Democratic camps,"" said Charles Lee, director of advocacy for Audubon Florida. Everglades delay vote Canova’s campaign points to Wasserman Schultz’s vote in the state Senate to delay Everglades cleanup and to votes on two farm bills while in Congress. In 2003, then state Sen. Wasserman Schultz voted to delay for seven years the requirement for sugar companies to clean up polluted discharges that had hurt the Everglades. It passed the state Senate 38-0 and the House 96-18, and Gov. Jeb Bush signed it into law. The well-financed sugar industry fought for the delay, while environmental groups opposed it. Two days later, Wasserman Schultz changed her vote to ""no"" because she said she was ""betrayed and misled"" about the facts. The Senate passed amendments that they believed were offered by the U.S. Justice Department but had actually been written by state environmental officials. Changing a vote is ceremonial only and carries zero practical effect -- except public relations. Ryan Banfill, Wasserman Schultz’s spokesman, said that she initially supported the bill because it included a provision to buy sugar lands for filtration and was better than a 20-year-delay alternative. Sugar votes in Congress Canova’s campaign also says Wasserman Schultz supported the sugar industry because of her votes to renew the 1981 Farm Bill in 2008 and 2014. The legislation is a sweeping bill that funds an array of nutrition and agriculture programs for multiple years. So if Wasserman Schultz voted against the farm bill, she would have also voted against food stamps, assistance to food banks and economic development programs in rural areas such as providing broadband internet service. But if Wasserman Schultz had opposed the sugar portion of the bills she could have said so and she didn’t, Canova’s campaign said. The farm bill gives lucrative benefits to the sugar industry. Specifically, it gives loans to processors and limits sugar imports to the United States. The government can also buy the surplus sugar and sell it for ethanol production. These benefits amount to market controls that reduce the supply of sugar, thus making it more expensive, said Josh Sewell, a policy analyst at Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that is critical of the sugar policy. The industry disagrees with the term ""subsidy."" ""A direct subsidy -- a check -- we do not get that,"" said Ryan Weston, executive vice president of the Florida Sugarcane League. But Sewell said the price controls, marketing allotments and limits on imports are all government manipulations designed to provide an economic benefit to a set group and function as subsidies. ""Any governmental action that reduces the cost of doing business or increases prices beyond the normal functioning of a free market is a subsidy,"" he said. ""In this case consumers, food manufacturers, and sugar producers outside of the United States are on the losing end."" The industry argues it needs the aid to compete globally with other countries that subsidize sugar and that the aid helps save jobs. Critics, including candy companies and consumer watchdogs, argue that it drives up prices for consumers and amounts to corporate welfare. In recent years, there have been several national proposals by Democrats and Republicans to change the sugar program, but votes are rare. In June 2013, however, the House and Senate voted on sugar amendments that would have scaled back the industry’s benefits. The amendments failed in both chambers with Wasserman Schultz voting ""no."" Most of the Florida delegation voted against the amendment, including both of Florida’s senators Marco Rubio, a Republican, and Bill Nelson, a Democrat. Banfill said Wasserman Schultz voted against the amendment because she said it would keep the market stable, protect American jobs and maintain the program allowing the government to buy and then sell surplus sugar to ethanol producers. Lee, of Audubon Florida, says Wasserman Schultz isn’t alone in her support of the federal government’s sugar policy: ""The same attack could be applied to virtually every member of Congress from Florida and it could be applied to virtually every member of the Legislature."" Banfill pointed to other efforts by Wasserman Schultz to clean up the Everglades and her 92 percent lifetime rating from the League of Conservation Voters. She has supported a clean water rule proposed by the EPA and helped get the authorization included in the budget for multiple segments of the Tamiami Trail to restore natural water flow to part of the Everglades. She is one of many cosponsors of the Central Everglades Planning Project that includes restoration projects but hasn’t received a vote yet. Those are all steps that could help the Everglades and the environment, but the sugar industry’s benefits from the government remain in place. ""Yes, these positions were important and significant,"" Lee said. ""However, these positions did not really challenge the sugar industry. On core issues for ‘big sugar’ they have her support."" This is no different from every other major political leader in Florida, he added. Our ruling Canova said Wasserman Schultz ""has voted for huge subsidies for the sugar industry ... as well as for delays in cleanups."" In 2003, while in the state Senate, Wasserman Schultz was part of a unanimous vote for a seven-year delay to clean up the Everglades. Canova omits that two days later she changed her vote, but the vote had no practical effect and the measure passed anyway. Canova also said Wasserman Schultz voted to subsidize the sugar industry when she voted for the farm bill in 2008 and 2014. The farm bills didn’t contain actual cash subsidies, but they clearly contained lucrative benefits for the industry. The farm bill is a sweeping bill that benefits a long list of programs -- not just sugar. Wasserman Schultz has taken other steps to support Everglades cleanup. But Canova’s point about her specific actions is largely accurate. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e8e8d7dc-ac5b-467d-bd9a-704468f40e5d",/factchecks/2016/jul/25/tim-canova/tim-canova-attacks-debbie-wasserman-schultzs-recor/
