Donald Trump says China, Singapore have death penalty for drug dealers
","President Donald Trump floated the idea of imposing the death penalty on drug dealers in the United States during his Pennsylvania rally, saying China and Singapore do it and they don’t have a drug problem. ""The only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness,"" Trump said March 10 while stumping for Republican congressional candidate Rick Saccone. ""When you catch a drug dealer … you got to put him away for a long time."" Trump shared conversations he had with leaders of China and Singapore. ""When I was in China and other places, by the way, I said, Mr. President, do you have a drug problem? ‘No, no, no, we do not.’ I said, Huh. Big country, 1.4 billion people, right. Not much of a drug problem. I said what do you attribute that to? ‘Well, the death penalty.’"" On Singapore, ""I said, Mr. President, what happens with your drugs? ‘No. We don't have a problem, President.’ I said, really why? ‘We have a zero tolerance.’ And he is not playing games … So what do you mean no problem? ‘We have a zero tolerance policy.’ What does that mean? ‘That means if we catch a drug dealer, death penalty.’ "" PolitiFact decided to fact-check whether China and Singapore have the death penalty for drug dealers as Trump claimed. (We will set aside for now whether these countries have ""no"" drug problems as a result, as Trump claimed the leaders said.) We found those countries do have the death penalty for individuals who traffic, smuggle or transport certain drugs. The White House did not comment on the record, but in the context of Trump’s speech, it appears these are the individuals he was referring to when speaking about ""drug dealers"" — not just individuals who may sell drugs on the streets. Nonetheless, China and Singapore have also been called out as human rights abusers for these practices, and drug policy and law experts expressed skepticism about the death penalty being a deterrent for drug trafficking in the United States. Chinese law says that individuals who smuggle, traffic, transport or manufacture drugs and meet certain conditions are to be punished with 15 years of fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment or death sentence, and confiscation of their properties. The law mentions certain amounts of opium, heroin, methylaniline and ""other narcotic drugs of large quantities."" Human rights groups and experts say data on death sentences and executions in China is unreliable and unknown. That information is kept as a state secret. Amnesty International estimates thousands of people are executed and sentenced to death each year. Given data limitations, it's difficult to assess the efficacy of its policy against drug offenders. Singapore’s Misuse of Drugs Act calls for the death penalty for individuals convicted of trafficking specified amounts of opium, cocaine, cannabis, and other substances. The law said the word ""traffic"" means to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute. Individuals possessing certain amounts of specified drugs are also presumed to have it for the purpose of trafficking, unless proven otherwise. Recent law revisions give courts discretion not to impose the death penalty in certain circumstances. A March 2010 study on executions, deterrence and homicide in Hong Kong and Singapore said there are ""no decent indicators"" available regarding drug use over time in Singapore, and if the data exists, ""they are a government secret."" Singapore’s minister for foreign affairs, Vivian Balakrishnan, at a September 2016 United Nations meeting said his country regarded drug trafficking ""as a most serious crime,"" and that the death penalty kept major drug syndicates away from Singapore. Singapore had eight executions for drugs from 2015 to 2017, according to a March 2018 report from Harm Reduction International.  Drug policy and law experts said attempts at similar laws in the United States would face constitutional obstacles. They pointed to a high bar for the death penalty established in the 2008 U.S. Supreme Court case Kennedy vs. Louisiana, which addressed whether states violate the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment by imposing the death sentence for the crime of child rape. The court’s opinion said ""the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim’s life was not taken."" However, the court said its concern was limited to crimes against individual persons and did not address offenses against the State, such as treason, espionage, terrorism, and drug kingpin activity. Congress in 1994 enacted a law allowing the imposition of the death penalty for drug kingpins even if no death occurred. ""If the death penalty is unconstitutional to impose against a child rapist, it is hard to imagine a court upholding its imposition against a person for selling drugs,"" said Alex Kreit, a law professor and co-director of the Center for Criminal Law and Policy at Thomas Jefferson School of Law. Experts also questioned how effective the death penalty would be as a deterrent for drug offenders. ""The likelihood of getting caught, prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced to death — especially at the federal level with only three executions since 1964 — is tiny,"" said Matthew Robinson, a professor of criminal justice at Appalachian State University. Trump said China and Singapore impose the death penalty on drug dealers. Chinese law says that individuals who smuggle, traffic, transport or manufacture drugs and meet certain conditions can receive a death sentence. Singapore’s Misuse of Drugs Act also calls for the death penalty for individuals convicted of trafficking specified amounts of opium, cocaine, cannabis, and other substances.

Did Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Michael Screnock 'vow to uphold' the NRA platform?
","With the Florida school shooting still fresh on many minds, the National Rifle Association became the focus of an attack in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. The attack came from Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet, who is backed by liberals, against Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock,  who is supported by conservatives. It was made during their televised debate in Milwaukee on March 2, 2018, a month before the April 3, 2018 election for a 10-year term on the high court. Screnock chafed at criticism Dallet made about activities he engaged in before becoming a judge. Then Dallet replied with criticism of his more recent behavior, saying of Screnock: ""I’ll point out some things he’s done during the campaign, like vowed to uphold the platform of the NRA."" Screnock did win the NRA’s endorsement. But did he ""vow to uphold"" the NRA’s platform? NRA queries candidates During the campaign, Screnock hasn’t said whether he believes two major gun rights cases were decided properly. Dallet said she thought the rulings — one by the U.S. Supreme Court, one by the Wisconsin Supreme Court — were made by ""activist"" justices. And while Dallet has backed tighter gun regulations, Screnock has said it isn’t up to courts to determine the best way to curb gun violence. The NRA, well known for fighting restrictions on the right to bear arms, describes itself as ""America’s foremost defender of Second Amendment rights."" Before the Feb. 20, 2018 primary election in the Supreme Court race, the group asked Dallet, Screnock and Madison lawyer Tim Burns, who was eliminated in the primary,  to submit a statement ""stating your positions on Second Amendment issues."" The letter said the NRA would use the responses in rating the candidates, and that the ratings would be communicated to NRA members. Only Screnock responded. NRA endorses Screnock To back Dallet’s attack on Screnock, her campaign cited a mailing the NRA sent to its members before the primary. The mailing, revealed by the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now, urged NRA members to vote for the ""pro-Second Amendment"" Screnock, saying in part: ""Michael Screnock will interpret our Constitution the way our founding fathers intended and has vowed to protect your firearms freedom."" So, there’s the word vowed that Dallet used. But that’s quoting the NRA and not Screnock himself, and it refers to firearms freedom generally, not any particular agenda. Now, to what Screnock actually said. Screnock’s response to the NRA letter  We don’t know, of course, if Screnock had any private contacts with the NRA in connection with the campaign. What is available is his response to the NRA’s request, which Dallet and One Wisconsin Now had been calling on Screnock to release Nearly a week after the primary, Screnock released to the Associated Press the email he sent to the NRA in response to its request for his positions on Second Amendment issues. Key excerpts: I am a Judge, and I have served as an attorney, so I know firsthand the importance of upholding the rule of law, protecting public safety, and respecting the Constitution and the separation of powers. I also know about the dangers of legislating from the bench.

Judges are not legislators, nor are we executives. Our job is to interpret and apply the law, based not on our personal or political beliefs, but by relying on statutes and the Constitution. Simply put, our job is to be arbiters of the law; not policy analysts or political activists. This of course includes the Second Amendment …. Having an independent judiciary comprised of justices with an unwavering commitment to upholding the rule of law, to recognizing and respecting the separation of powers, and to interpreting the Constitution as it was intended is critical to preserving and maintaining our democracy and our republic ….

On a personal note, I am a proud gun owner and enjoy carrying on our passion for the outdoors with my three adult sons. So, while volunteering that he is a proud gun owner, Screnock pledged to uphold the Constitution, including the Second Amendment, rather than to be a political activist. But he didn’t vow to take a position on policies or laws or cases that might be part of a broader NRA platform. In terms of the NRA’s agenda, its most recent calls for action include, while referencing the Florida school shooting, urging members to tell lawmakers to oppose new gun-control proposals, and stating opposition to proposals that would prohibit adults ages 18 to 20 from acquiring rifles and shotguns. Our rating Dallet says that during the Supreme Court campaign, Screnock ""vowed to uphold the platform of the NRA."" Screnock told the NRA his job is to be an arbiter of the law, including the Second Amendment, and not a political activist. But he hasn’t gone so far as to vow to uphold any particular platform.

No, Mr. President, California is not ‘begging’ for a wall
","During his visit to the U.S.-Mexico border near San Diego, President Donald Trump made this confounding claim: ""The state of California is begging us to build walls"" along the border. Deep blue California is ""begging"" the federal government to build a wall? Really? The president’s statement seemed false on its face, but we dug in for a fact-check just to make sure. Our research Here’s Trump’s full statement made March 13, 2018: ""For the people that say 'no wall,' if you had no walls over here, you wouldn’t have a country. The state of California is begging us to build walls in certain areas. They don’t tell you that. And we said no, we won’t do it until we build the whole wall."" We asked Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown’s office about Trump’s statement. A spokesman for the governor indicated he had no idea what Trump was talking about. ""We gave up trying to translate – and fully understand – the tweets and extemporaneous thoughts of the president long ago,"" Evan Westrup said in an email. Others rejected Trump’s claim outright: Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democratic candidate for governor and top Trump critic, tweeted: ""California is not ""begging"" you for this wall. Your wall is a waste of money and is literally impossible to complete. It will look more like a piece of swiss cheese than an insurmountable barrier. It's nothing more than a 6th century solution to a 21st century problem."" ""Not exactly sure where he got that from"" Immigration and environmental experts said the state of California, at least in recent years, hasn’t expressed any desire to build a border wall. ""Not at all,"" said Louis DeSipio, a UC Irvine political science professor who studies immigration. ""I’m not exactly sure where (Trump) got that from. Perhaps he heard it from some local sheriff who wants a wall."" ""It’s been increasingly difficult to make sense of the things this administration says, and President Trump in particular,"" added Randy Serraglio, a spokesman for the Center for Biological Diversity. The environmental group and state government were part of a recent lawsuit against the federal government’s plans to build the wall in California. Federal judge Gonzalo Curiel rejected their argument about environmental concerns and ruled the Trump administration could move forward on the project. Not the first confusing claim This is not the first time Trump has made a strange claim about California’s desire to build sections of a border wall. On Feb. 28, 2018, following the judge’s ruling, Trump tweeted: ""I have decided that sections of the Wall that California wants built NOW will not be built until the whole Wall is approved. Big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed. OUR COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY!"" National news outlets attempted to make sense of that tweet, without success. A Politico article assessed the tweet this way: ""It was not clear what Trump meant in suggesting that 'California wants' a border wall 'now,' since the state opposed his administration’s efforts. White House spokespeople did not immediately return emails seeking further clarity regarding the president’s post and whether the administration intends to delay work in California even after securing a judicial victory."" We found an interview with one top California Democrat, Attorney General Xavier Beccera, indicating he could support a barrier at the border, but no statements where top leaders are ""begging"" for a wall. Becerra told the Los Angeles Times in September 2017 that he supports ""doing what our experts tell us we should do"" on border security, whether that includes a physical barrier, more troops on the ground or virtual enforcement through aerial detection or surveillance. On the day of Trump’s California visit, Becerra was stronger in his response to Trump. He told Fox News, ""We’ve always called for border security on a bipartisan basis, but building walls, that’s a medieval technology that really doesn’t have a place in the 21st century"" Perhaps Trump meant Californians, and not their state government, want the wall? But even in that case, the president is wrong. A September 2017 survey showed 68 percent of likely voters in the state oppose building a wall along the entire southern border. The White House responded to a request for evidence after publication. We have included its response at the end of this fact check.  Our ruling President Trump claimed ""the state of California is begging us to build walls in certain areas,"" along the border. ""They don’t tell you that."" There’s no evidence backing up the president’s mystifying statement. If anything, California and its Democratic leaders are some of the strongest opponents of Trump’s border wall, at least as he’s promoted it. Some state leaders rejected Trump’s claim outright while others said they had no idea what he was talking about. We rated Trump’s claim Pants On Fire. UPDATE: A White House spokesman responded to our request for evidence after publication. He cited ""great efforts"" by the federal government ""to collaborate with local and state authorities"" on a two-mile border wall replacement project in Imperial County east of San Diego.

The spokesman also cited a budget plan to create ""14 miles of new border wall system that will replace existing secondary fence in the San Diego Sector.""

Is Donald Trump right that aluminum, steel industries have been decimated?
","President Donald Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum, a move that Trump argued would protect an American metals industry beleaguered by foreign imports. ""We’re doing tariffs on steel. We cannot lose our steel industry. It’s a fraction of what it once was. And we can’t lose our aluminum industry. Also a fraction of what it once was,"" Trump said March 6, two days before the tariffs were officially signed. We decided to take a closer look at how these industries have fared over time. Trump is correct that employment numbers for metals have fallen sharply.  Steel and aluminum employment is significantly lower today than decades past. According to an analysis by the Council on Foreign Relations, U.S. steel employment peaked around 650,000 jobs in the 1950s, compared to around 140,000 today. An analysis by Bloomberg shows some 50,000 aluminum production jobs have disappeared since 1990, a roughly 46 percent reduction. As of December 2017, there were roughly 59,000 aluminum production jobs, according to Bloomberg. Experts cited a number of reasons why the metals industry has shed jobs, from improved factory logistics to the diminished power of unions to protect even unproductive workers. But the consensus view is that the biggest cause has been technological advances. ""In terms of employment, the big story is automation across the board,"" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which generally supports free trade. So how many of these jobs were squeezed out by foreign imports? J. Bradford Jensen, a professor of international business at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, told us that ""imports did have something to do with the loss of employment in steel and aluminum, but the more important factor is technological change and productivity growth."" ""Tariffs won't change that, much like relaxing regulations on coal and pollution will not bring back many coal-mining jobs,"" he said. In short, compared with decades past, the U.S. metals industry can now do more with less. ""If you want to know why the steel industry employs so fewer workers than in decades past, there is the answer,"" wrote Daniel Griswold, a senior researcher at the free-market Mercatus Center at George Mason University. So Trump is correct that employment levels in the the metal industry are a fraction of what they once were, though it’s worth noting experts tended to attribute this more to automation than foreign imports. Evaluating Trump’s statement is trickier when it comes to steel and aluminum production. The United States produced about 82 million tons of raw steel in 2017, according to a U.S. Geological Survey estimate. As the chart below shows, that’s well below the peak 137 million tons of steel produced in 1973.  Steel production was certainly higher during the 1960s and 1970s. However, other than these two decades, U.S. steel output has occupied a fairly narrow band in the post-war era, and current output levels far exceed production levels from before 1940. Experts we spoke to said it’s important to look at these numbers in context. Looking only at metric tons of production would not reflect improvements in product quality, for example, or declines in demand. Some noted that the primary metals industries now make up a smaller share of the modern economy than they did in the past. Aluminum is also a bit tricky because there are multiple ways to measure production. One method, known as primary production, involves producing aluminum from raw materials. U.S. primary production of aluminum rose steadily from the post-war era until around 1980, when it began a steady decline. That same period saw increased use of the secondary production, a manner of making aluminum from recycled scrap. Secondary production increased from 22 percent of aluminum production in 1980, to 64 percent of domestic production in 2016, according to the Commerce Department. Due to its robust aluminum recycling industry, the United States now leads the world in secondary aluminum production, according to the Commerce Department.  ""The recycling part is interesting in that it makes the point of declining need to worry about imports,"" said Michael J. Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University. ""Use of aluminum is rising, but we aren’t extracting as much from the ground as we used to, in part because almost all the nation now recycles metals."" Trump said the U.S. steel and aluminum industry is ""a fraction of what it once was."" Trump is correct that employment levels in the metal industry are a fraction of what they once were, though experts attribute this more to automation than foreign imports. Steel output is also not the highest it’s ever been, though experts said it’s important to consider steel production in a broader context that includes improvements to steel as well as how output has responded to declining demand. While the amount of aluminum made from raw materials has declined since the early 1980s, the output of aluminum made from recycled materials has fairly steadily climbed since WWII, and the United States now leads the world in secondary aluminum production.

Richard Cordray told Ohio board to give permit to pro-gun group for rally, Kucinich says
","In a speech after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., Dennis Kucinich said fellow Democrat Richard Cordray ran his attorney general’s office as ""an extension of the NRA."" That included Cordray helping a gun rights group hold a rally outside of the statehouse, Kucinich said in a Feb. 27 speech to the City Club in Cleveland. Kucinich has vowed to make guns a key topic as he competes with Democrats, including Cordray, in the May 8 primary for governor. ""One unpublicized official act was a very unusual intervention with the Capitol Square Commission,"" Kucinich said. ""As the commission’s attorney, the attorney general directed it to permit an armed group to have a rally on the statehouse grounds, even taking the extraordinary step of assuming personal responsibility for waiving an insurance requirement in the event of an incident."" Our fact-checking ears perked up with an ""unpublicized official act,"" so we went in search of the facts about Cordray’s actions related to a 2010 gun-rights rally. Kucinich was referring to the Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board, which oversees the statehouse in Columbus. The Attorney General’s office serves as legal counsel to the board. Although he has shown support for some gun control measures after the Parkland shooting, Cordray has had strong support in the past from gun rights groups. Kucinich was talking about a rally organized by Ohioans for Concealed Carry. The event was part of a national wave of marches leading up to the national Second Amendment March in Washington in April 2010. Kucinich’s campaign website linked to a YouTube video clip posted by Progress Ohio, a liberal group, showing about 10 minutes of the April 10, 2010, rally. The clip starts with Dan White, who was active with Ohioans for Concealed Carry, saying: ""I’m not lying, if it wasn’t for them I don’t think we would be on the square right now today. They were instrumental. They did their jobs very well."" Cordray, as attorney general, then followed: ""Thank you, Dan. So as he said, I’m counting on all of you because if there are any troubles it's my responsibility, but I am comfortable with that. I’m pleased to be here today at this Second Amendment rally."" Months later while speaking at an Ohioans for Concealed Carry rally in August 2010, Cordray recounted the difficulties in pulling off the April rally. The Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board was ""very unhappy and resistant"" about the planned rally, Cordray said. ""In the end, after having no real leg to stand on and denying a permit, they decided at the last minute they were going to require some giant insurance policy to have to be obtained for people to be able to have a rally on the statehouse grounds,"" Cordray said. Cordray said he spoke with board chair Richard Finan and asked, ""Look, you don’t require this of other groups, why would you be requiring this here?"" According to Cordray, Finan then asked, ""Are you willing to take responsibility?"" ""And I said, yes, I am willing to take responsibility,"" Cordray told the group. Finan, who has since retired from the board, told PolitiFact that he recalled Cordray reaching out to him before the rally. ""He told us we could go ahead and allow the rally to occur on the statehouse grounds,"" Finan said. We sought records from the board related to the 2010 rally, but a spokesman told us that it only keeps records for four years. However, Jeff Garvas, who organized the 2010 rally and is the president of Ohioans for Concealed Carry, shared with PolitiFact some of his correspondence with the board. Garvas told PolitiFact that his group obtained a permit from the advisory board about eight months before the event. Then, about two weeks before the rally, he said the board told the group that it had to pay for 10 state troopers and promise that no one would show up with a firearm. At some point, the board also told the group that it would have to obtain a half-million dollar insurance policy, he said. (Its special events policy states that the board may require the permit holder to file a certificate of insurance at least seven days prior to the event.) Garvas sent the board’s executive director, William Carleton, a letter raising objections to the firearm ban at the rally. Carleton wrote in an April 10 letter that Garvas had also verbally sought a waiver for the bond requirement and proof of insurance. Carleton granted the waiver as long as the group met certain conditions including holstering firearms and paying $1,000 for five state troopers. Carleton waived the requirement for a bond and proof of insurance. Carleton’s letter doesn’t mention Cordray, but an assistant attorney general was copied on the letter. Cordray’s spokesman Mike Gwin didn’t dispute Kucinich’s statement. Gwin said that the Attorney General’s office ""provided legal advice during the course of the permitting process that denying this group a rally permit would likely result in a costly and successful lawsuit by the protest organizers, as had happened with similar denied permits for statehouse rallies in the past."" Kucinich said Cordray directed an Ohio commission to ""permit an armed group to have a rally on the statehouse grounds, even taking the extraordinary step of assuming personal responsibility for waiving an insurance requirement in the event of an incident."" Kucinich was referring to a rally held in April 2010. A video shows Cordray speaking at the rally where he said ""if there are any troubles it's my responsibility but I am comfortable with that."" Months later, in another video, Cordray said that when the Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board denied a permit and required a ""giant insurance policy"" Cordray spoke with the board’s president and agreed to take responsibility for the event. Finan, the advisory board chair at the time, told PolitiFact that Cordray gave the go-ahead for the rally. Cordray didn’t appear to play the only role in allowing the group to hold the rally. The executive director of the board ultimately granted the waiver after exchanging communications with Ohioans for Concealed Carry.

Donald Trump takes dig at NASA, extols private rocketeers
","President Donald Trump looked to the stars, or at least near-Earth orbit, to cite yet another example of the private sector getting things done better and cheaper than the government. With rocket models decorating the table where Trump and his Cabinet met March 8, Trump singled out the private operators. ""Rich guys, they love rocket ships, and that's good,"" Trump said. ""That's better than us paying for it. And I noticed the prices of the last one, that they said it cost $80 million. If the government did it, the same thing would have cost probably 40 or 50 times that amount of money. I mean, literally."" We thought about Trump’s cost-multiplier estimate and wondered if it would cost NASA $3.2 billion to do what the private rockets do. The comparison is a stretch for several reasons, but as Jason Davis at the Planetary Society put it, the main one is ""it’s sort of like comparing a Ford Focus to a Cadillac Escalade."" The private rockets don’t need to go higher than low-Earth orbit. SpaceX, for example, carries supplies to the International Space Station, which is about 250 miles above the earth. With the shorter distance, the rockets can be smaller. The SpaceX Falcon 9 is about 230 feet high. NASA has left that closer-in zone to the private firms since 2006. Its field of play reaches further out, to the moon and beyond. NASA has been developing the Space Launch System, a veritable beast of a rocket where the shortest configuration is 322 feet tall. With that in mind, let’s look at the dollars. The list price of the most basic SpaceX rocket, the Falcon 9, is $62 million. If you want more lift, the Falcon Heavy goes for $90 million. So $80 million is a reasonable midpoint. Davis noted, though, that prices can run higher. ""The Air Force paid $97 million for the Falcon 9 that launched the DSCOVR climate satellite,"" he said. The key here is that this price tag covers the cost of producing and operating the rocket for each launch. Part of the money goes to recover the cost of designing and developing the rocket, and for that, it’s important to note that NASA and the companies shared the tab. In 2011, to ensure that two companies, SpaceX and Orbital ATK, had the capacity to supply the International Space Station, Congress provided $821 million, or about 44 percent of what it took to develop and test the commercial systems. That government investment made it easier for the firms to be commercially viable. Joshua Colwell, professor of planetary science and assistant director of the Florida Space Institute, told us having a guaranteed buyer also helped. ""SpaceX got to where it is in part thanks to lots of government contracts to send supplies to the International Space Station,"" Colwell said. NASA is building the Space Launch System to do much more than the private rockets. It will be safe enough to carry astronauts in a capsule called Orion — a separate huge expense in its own right — or pure cargo. As for distance, the minimum range is the moon, or about 239,000 miles from Earth, in contrast to the 250 miles distance to the International Space Station.  An artist’s rendition of the Space Launch System carrying the Orion capsule in to space. (NASA) This big rocket and its Orion capsule are scheduled for their first voyage in 2020. So, as a practical matter, there is no ongoing series of launches to compare to the private operators. There are a few ways to tackle the question. Davis at the Planetary Society looked at the development cost. ""The Space Launch System currently costs NASA more than $2 billion per year, and it's still under development,"" Davis said. ""It will go on two test flights over the next five years, so I suppose you could calculate that you're paying about $5 billion per flight."" On the other hand, this big rocket could be used more often over a longer stretch of time. The website Ars Technica is into rocket science and rocket budgets. In 2016, it estimated development and operation costs of $60 billion for the rocket, the Orion capsule and infrastructure on the ground at the Kennedy Space Center over the next two decades. Assuming one flight each year, the package cost of rocket, capsule and ground operations would come to $3 billion per flight. Ars Technica relayed a much slimmer price tag from NASA manager Bill Hill. In 2016, Hill said he was aiming for an annual cost of $2 billion a year with two flights annually by the end of the 2020s. That would drive the cost down to $1 billion per flight. Again, this is neither certain nor directly comparable to today’s private launches. Colwell puts no stock in Trump’s 40-50 times estimate. At the same time, he takes the larger point. ""It is probably true that SpaceX is cheaper than an equivalent government-developed rocket, but there is no equivalent government-developed rocket."" We reached out to the White House and did not hear back. Trump said that at $80 million per launch, private rockets are about 40 to 50 times cheaper than NASA would spend if it did ""the same thing."" The $80 million figure is roughly accurate, but the key flaw in the statement is that NASA is not doing the same thing. As part of a policy decision made a decade ago, NASA has left the shorter distance work to the private sector while it focuses on getting to the moon and beyond. We found a wide range of approaches and estimates of what it would cost to launch the Space Launch System on a year-in-year-out basis. The answers on the high end backed up Trump’s remark. The answers on the low end suggested he exaggerated. But fundamentally, this is a comparison between a Ford Fusion and a Cadillac Escalade. One will be much more expensive than the other, but they are used in very different ways. We rate this claim Half True. PolitiFact Democratic guest columnist and former U.S. Rep.

Headline that Jennifer Aniston formed 'celebrities for Trump' is fake news
","Actress Jennifer Aniston is not really forming a company to support President Donald Trump, despite a hoax you might have seen on Facebook. A March 10 headline by Universal News Portal falsely quoted Aniston as saying, ""Me and all the Trump supporter celebrities decide to make a company named ‘celebrities for Trump’, which fight against all anti Trump celebrities, I think President Trump needs our support."" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that Aniston has formed any group for celebrities to promote Trump. The story recycles fake news from another website last year. The Universal News Portal story didn’t match the headline. Instead, the story smashed together another story about a Saturday Night Live skit poking fun of Trump and a gossip story about Aniston and a clothing collection. In December 2016, Alec Baldwin on SNL pretended to be Trump retweeting a 16-year-old named Seth. ""I just retweeted the best tweet,"" Baldwin said, while pretending to be in the middle of a security briefing. ""I mean, wow, what a great, smart tweet."" In real life, Trump did retweet Seth Morton, a California teenager, who had been critical of CNN. The Universal News Story then pivots to an entirely different topic and lifts from a Gossip Cop story in 2017 about whether Aniston is launching a clothing collection with the Home Shopping Network. Aniston doesn’t appear to be particularly active in politics, though she did appear with other celebrities at a Hollywood Hills lunch fundraiser for Democrat Hillary Clinton in August 2016.

Challenger for Wisconsin U.S. Senate seat Vukmir misfires on trade barb against incumbent Baldwin
","Global trade is a hot button issue that got even hotter when President Donald Trump announced on March 1, 2018 that he would impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. In a tweet, Trump framed it this way: ""Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE!"" That harkened back to Trump’s inauguration speech, when he declared: ""We will follow two simple rules: ‘Buy American and hire American.’"" U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, has touted a similar Buy American theme, and has introduced a bill to require the use of U.S. steel and iron on some government water projects. Indeed, during an April 2017 visit to Snap-On in Kenosha, Trump endorsed Baldwin’s legislation: ""I support the concept of everything from the U.S. I’m very much into that and I agree with her 100 percent."" Meanwhile, state Sen. Leah Vukmir of Brookfield, a Republican who hopes to challenge Baldwin in November 2018, has trashed Baldwin’s ""Buy American"" record as ""empty words."" In an op-ed piece posted Jan. 25, 2018, on the Daily Caller website, Vukmir argued Baldwin’s support for Buy American is more show than substance. Vukmir’s piece read, in part: Senator Baldwin and her colleagues in Washington were given a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform an outdated, broken and costly tax code that discouraged job growth and investment in America, failed to reward the middle-class or boost economic growth, and lined the pockets of Washington D.C. special interests, all at the expense of hard-working citizens and small businesses. She claims to support a ""Buy America"" philosophy, but her actions speak louder than her empty words. Is it true, as Vukmir claims, that Baldwin supports a proposal at the same time she is undermining it with her votes? The supporting evidence When asked to provide backup to support the ""actions speak louder than her empty words"" claim, Vukmir communications staffer Mattias Gugel wrote: ""When it comes to helping Wisconsin’s middle class and making America more competitive through pro-growth policies like tax reform, repealing Davis–Bacon and right to work, Sen. Baldwin stands in the way every single time."" Here are brief explanations of those references: Tax reform: In December 2017, Trump signed into law a $1.5 trillion tax bill, capping a yearlong effort by the White House and Republicans in Congress to cut tax rates for corporations and individuals. The legislation marked the first major reform of the American tax system in more than 30 years. Baldwin labeled the plan a ""giveaway to the wealthiest few"" and voted against the measure Davis-Bacon: The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 is a federal law that requires local ""prevailing wage"" pay for laborers and mechanics on public works projects. It applies to ""contractors and subcontractors performing on federally funded or assisted contracts in excess of $2,000 for the construction, alteration, or repair (including painting and decorating) of public buildings or public works."" Conservative Republicans have tried to repeal Davis-Bacon, but the provision has the strong backing of the trades unions, as well as Democrats, including Baldwin, along with many moderate Republicans. Right-to-work: These provisions exist in 28 states, including Wisconsin. In general, they provide that employees in unionized workplaces may not be compelled to join a union, nor compelled to pay for any part of the cost of union representation, while generally receiving the same benefits as union members who do contribute. Baldwin opposed the ""right-to-work"" measure in 2015 when it was approved in Wisconsin, arguing it would ""weaken the economic security of hard working middle class families."" So, Baldwin has opposed the three measures. But each of those examples applies more broadly to economic-related matters than to a specific Buy American plan, which was the subject of Vukmir’s claim. And, if related matters are tallied on one side of the ledger, it’s only fair to look at other actions by Baldwin. The other side of the coin Baldwin made the ""Buy American"" legislation a highlight of the first TV ads in her re-election campaign. They began running Feb. 27, 2018. In an email, campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt cited a series of additional measures specifically related to Buy American: 1. As a member of the House of Representatives, Baldwin introduced the CHEATS Act during the 112th Congress (2011-2012). The measure, which did not pass, would have allowed the U.S. to impose duties on Chinese imports that were receiving illegal subsidies from the Chinese government, allowing them to undercut the prices of Wisconsin’s manufacturers. 2. During the 115th Congress (2017-2018), Baldwin introduced a bill to require the president to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. The TPP, put in place under President Barack Obama, was a 12-nation agreement among the United States and Pacific-rim countries that was designed in part to counter China’s rising dominance of the region. Shortly after taking office in January 2017, Trump formally abandoned the agreement. Baldwin had labeled TPP ""a bad deal for American workers."" ""Instead of creating an even playing field, this deal increases the global race to the bottom in worker pay,"" Baldwin said in a Jan. 23, 2017, news release. ""American manufacturing jobs will continue to go abroad as Buy American rules are further eroded."" 3. In addition, on Feb. 20, 2018 Baldwin announced the Made in American Shipbuilding Act, which would require any vessel that was paid for with U.S. taxpayer dollars to be constructed with American parts and by American workers. (A footnote: When we asked Baldwin for her position on Trump’s tariff plan, she took a tempered approach, saying she supports sending a ""strong message to bad actors"" like Russia and China, but fears a blanket tariff could start a trade war that could hurt Wisconsin manufacturers and the state's agricultural economy.)
  Our rating Vukmir said Baldwin ""claims to support a ‘Buy American’ philosophy, but her actions speak louder than her empty words."" Vukmir cited several broad matters that relate to the economy, but none that specifically applied to undermining Buy American initiatives. Meanwhile, Baldwin has been engaged with other ""Buy American"" actions. Indeed, at times her views seem to align with Trump’s ""America First"" policies. We rate Vukmir’s claim False.",/factchecks/2018/mar/12/leah-vukmir/Vukmir-misfires-on-Baldwin-trade-barb/
"['New York', 'Guns', 'John Faso']","
Is most gun crime committed by those who illegally possess guns?
","U.S. Rep. John Faso says he opposes some gun-control measures because they target the wrong people. Laws that limit the rights of law-abiding gun owners don’t make sense because most gun crime is committed by those who illegally possess a gun, said Faso, a Republican. ""The vast majority of crime that is gun related is committed by people who illegally are possessing that firearm,"" Faso said in an interview on C-SPAN. Faso - who represents parts of the Hudson Valley and Capital Region - supports strengthening background checks for gun buyers, banning bump stocks and raising the age to purchase a firearm to 21. He does not support other measures, like a ban on assault-style firearms. Is Faso right that the majority of gun crime is committed by those who illegally possess a gun? National data The last time the government tracked this kind of data was in 2004 when the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics surveyed inmates in federal and state prisons. Part of the survey asked inmates who had a gun during their crime where they originally got it. Dr. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, was part of a team that used the data to estimate how many illegally possessed guns. In the 13 states with the fewest restrictions on gun ownership, 40 percent of inmates illegally obtained the gun they used, Webster said. Only about 13 percent purchased the gun from a store or pawn shop. In the other 37 states, including New York state, 60 percent of inmates illegally procured the gun they used, Webster said.   ""If you look at the most stringent standards for legal gun ownership, it’s more like 65 percent,"" Webster said. The data is hard to track because gun ownership laws vary from state to state. New York state has universal background checks, for example. All gun sales have to go through a federally licensed dealer. A state like Mississippi, meanwhile, does not require background checks outside of gun shops. New York state also prohibits people convicted of several violent misdemeanors from buying or owning a gun. Many other states do not, Webster said. ""What people don’t really appreciate is that the standards for gun ownership are so that you can be a legal gun owner but not so much law abiding,"" Webster said. About 48 percent of state prison inmates surveyed said they got the gun they used from a family member, friend, gun store, pawn shop, flea market, or gun show. Most states only require a background check if the purchase happens at a gun store, according to the Giffords Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Forty percent of state prison inmates admitted they obtained the gun illegally on the black market, from a drug dealer, or by stealing it. Federal agencies have not released research similar to Webster’s on illegal gun crime. His study was the only analysis of federal data we could find and experts were not aware of another. Congress since the 1990s has had an effective ban on federal taxpayer money being spent on research into gun violence as a public health issue and gun control advocacy by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But other government agencies are free to collect data on guns and gun crime. Local data Regional studies have found that a higher share of criminals did not legally possess a gun when they committed their crimes. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh teamed up with the Pittsburgh Police Department in 2016 to look at almost 900 firearms recovered from crime scenes in 2008. They found the criminals connected to these firearms did not legally possess them in 80 percent of the cases. A study from the University of Chicago looked at 99 inmates at the Cook County Jail in Chicago in 2015. It found only about 3 percent of inmates who used a gun bought it at a gun store. Researchers did not track the share of inmates who purchased a gun legally through other means. Previous ruling MSNBC Host Joe Scarborough claimed in 2015 that a very small share of crimes were committed by those who legally possess guns. PolitiFact rated that claim Half True. For that check, we spoke with Philip Cook, a professor of economics and sociology at Duke University. He co-authored the study from the University of Chicago. ""I think it’s safe to say that a low percentage of criminal assaults and robberies are committed with guns that were acquired by legal purchase from a gun store,"" Cook said in 2015. As we noted in 2015, not all guns purchased outside a gun store are illegally obtained. We checked back with Cook for this story. He said the data on violent crimes supports Faso’s claim. ""Most people who commit assault, robbery, or murder with a gun anywhere in the U.S. are disqualified under federal law from being in possession of a gun due to age, criminal record, addiction status, immigration status or other reason,"" Cook said. But there are caveats to the data, experts warned. • Some gun crimes are never solved, so it’s impossible to know whether the gun was obtained illegally. • The national data is more than a decade old. The prison population of 2004 may be different from today’s inmates. • The data also varies between states. An illegal gun sale in one state may be legal in another. Someone can legally sell a gun to their friend without a background check in Mississippi, but not New York. That means Faso’s claim may be true in some states but false in others. Our ruling Faso said ""The vast majority of crime that is gun related is committed by people who illegally are possessing that firearm."" People can differ on what constitutes a ""vast majority."" What's more, illegal gun crime is not well researched in the U.S. The latest data is more than a decade old. One analysis of the data showed Faso’s claim is not true in some states while true in others. But experts say most gun crime is likely committed by those who illegally possess guns. His statement is accurate but needed additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/mar/12/john-faso/do-illegal-gun-owners-commit-most-gun-crime-rep-fa/
"['National', 'Military', 'Trade', 'Donald Trump']","
How 'vital to our national security' is steel, aluminum?
","When President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, the stated reason was national security. ""The president is exercising his authority to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports in order to protect our national security,"" the White House said in a statement. Specifically, the White House cited section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which it said ""provides the president with authority to adjust imports being brought into the United States in quantities or under circumstances that threaten to impair national security."" Hours before he officially announced the tariffs, Trump said he was ""taking action to protect American industries that are vital to our national security, including American aluminum and steel. … Aluminum and steel are the backbone of our nation. They are the bedrock of our defense industrial base."" Is Trump right that American aluminum and steel ""are vital to our national security"" and ""the bedrock of our defense industrial base""?  In an undated but recent memo, Defense Secretary James Mattis acknowledged concerns about ""unfair trade practices,"" but he emphasized that ""the U.S. military requirements for steel and aluminum each only represent about 3 percent of U.S. production."" In other words, domestic production in the United States is more than 30 times the amount required to satisfy Defense Department needs -- before having to use a single ton of imported steel. Defense’s share of the high-purity aluminum produced domestically is a bit higher -- 10 percent -- but here, too, this ""is more than adequately met"" by existing U.S. sources, according to the Aerospace Industries Association of America. The Pentagon’s small share of U.S. steel and aluminum output would seem to undercut the argument of national security as a credible justification for the tariffs. However, the decision to impose tariffs for steel and aluminum imports was made based on a different argument by the Commerce Department, which is headed by a longtime free-trade skeptic, Wilbur Ross. In a pair of January 2018 reports, the Commerce Department addressed the role of the American steel and aluminum industries in preserving national security. In both cases, the department said that action against imports was necessary. The department concluded that the present import situation was ""weakening our internal economy,"" which it noted was language included in the 1962 law. Specifically, the law says: In the administration of this section, the director (of the Office of Emergency Planning) and the president shall further recognize the close relation of the economic welfare of the nation to our national security, and shall take into consideration the impact of foreign competition on the economic welfare of individual domestic industries; and any substantial unemployment, decrease in revenues of government, loss of skills or investment, or other serious effects resulting from the displacement of any domestic products by excessive imports shall be considered, without excluding other factors, in determining whether such weakening of our internal economy may impair the national security. The law offers a more expansive definition of national security than might be obvious on the surface. Both Commerce reports cite a variety of elements of ""national security"" that fall well beyond the scope of military activities. National security, according to the steel report, ""encompasses U.S. critical infrastructure sectors including transportation systems, the electric power grid, water systems, and energy generation systems."" Similarly, the aluminum report cites ""critical infrastructure sectors that are central to the essential operations of the U.S. economy and government, including power transmissions, transportation systems, manufacturing industries, construction, and others."" Wayne Ranick, spokesman for the United Steelworkers labor union, said he has no quarrel with the Defense Department’s 3 percent calculation. However, he argued -- as the Commerce Department did -- that ""to sustain that 3 percent, there must be viable U.S. aluminum and steel mills."" Ongoing viability, Ranick said, requires operating at 80 percent capacity. ""Mills that have so few orders that they must operate at less than 80 percent capacity shut down sections, lay off workers and lose money,"" he said. ""When too much money is lost, the company goes bankrupt and the mill closes."" He pointed to findings by the Commerce Department that there’s only one company left in the United States that produces the Navy armor plate used to build the Virginia Class Submarines, and that only one smelter produces the high-purity aluminum required for defense aerospace needs. Skeptics, however, see this argument as industry concerns masquerading as national security concerns. ""Steel and aluminum are widely traded commodities in international markets, and the U.S. has ample production capacity to satisfy its defense needs,"" said Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which generally has a free-trade bent. ""The case for tariffs made by the Commerce Department is that other countries underprice steel and aluminum, hurting U.S. production. This is not a national security argument."" Critics of the tariffs say they can cause at least as many national security headaches as they solve. For instance, the tariff issue has already irked U.S. allies whose assistance is needed in countless military and diplomatic situations across the globe. Those allies also tend to be valued customers for the U.S. defense sector, which has a sizable trade surplus with the rest of the world. ""When relations overall are good, we export quite a lot of military equipment to allies and partners,"" said Remy Nathan, vice president for international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association. Because a lot of that business come from maintenance, repair and spare parts of U.S.-made military items, this is ""the gift that keeps on giving."" There’s also a concern that the tariffs could kick off a global trade war, with unknown but potentially significant impacts on the availability of other inputs needed by the U.S. military, not to mention the economy at large. A Bloomberg article noted that access to solid rocket fuel is a commodity that should be much more worrisome for the United States than either steel or aluminum. In the meantime, the decision to justify the tariffs based on national security could embolden other countries to impose trade barriers of their own on the basis of ""national security,"" with negative impacts for the United States. In addition, while the tariffs would likely aid domestic producers of aluminum and steel, they would presumably raise prices for companies that turn those raw materials into finished products, and this could hurt national security as well. This is especially acute for companies that sell both to private sector companies and the Pentagon, Nathan said. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Trump said that American aluminum and steel ""are vital to our national security. ... They are the bedrock of our defense industrial base."" Military purchases account for a small fraction of U.S. production for both metals, to say nothing of foreign imports. Critics add that the tariffs could have negative impacts on national security that aren’t taken into account by the White House or Commerce Department. Bolstering Trump’s point, however, the 1962 law used as justification for the tariffs specifically allows a more expansive definition that adds far-reaching critical infrastructure to specific military activities. Because this claim needs so much additional context, we rate the statement Half True. ",/factchecks/2018/mar/09/donald-trump/how-vital-our-national-security-are-steel-aluminum/

Did Obama cut $300 million for school safety? Not really
","Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, says to prevent school shootings in the future, the country should look to the past. In 2013, Cruz and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, proposed legislation that Cruz said could have prevented the Feb. 14 Parkland, Fla., shooting. ""One of the things Grassley-Cruz did was increase funding for school safety by $300 million,"" Cruz said on CNN March 7. ""The Obama administration had cut $300 million from school safety. You know, if that had been in place, that might well have meant that another armed police officer could have been in Parkland and could have stopped that killer before he murdered those teenagers."" Cruz’s comment about Obama cutting $300 million from school safety caught our attention. We wondered if Cruz was right. Cruz’s office pointed to Obama's 2010 budget. That year President Barack Obama called for the elimination of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities State Grants program as part of his budget request. The savings by cutting the program: $294 million. ""President Obama’s 2010 budget zeroed out $294 million in school safety funds,"" Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said. ""That is a fact."" Congress went along and defunded the program. So that’s about $300 million. But there’s more to this story than just the dollar figure. The particular state grant program Obama and Congress cut was formula-driven, essentially providing guaranteed money to states and school districts. However, in the same budget that eliminated the formula program, Obama requested an additional $100 million for a companion program that handed out grants on a case-by-case basis. Congress ultimately only added $51 million to that, but in any event, the cut Obama sought was closer to $200 million, not $300 million. It is also important to note how that money was spent. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools program had a focus on preventing both drug use and violence. It covered ""health education, early intervention, pupil services, mentoring, rehabilitation referral, and related activities."" William Modzeleski, who headed the program through 2011, told us the program funded a variety of things that went far beyond armed guards or security. ""We were involved in a wide range of activities, ranging from working with the Secret Service on how to identify students on the pathway to violence to one where we spent millions to ensure schools had emergency management plans,"" Modzeleski told us. The program also funded mental health and responses to the H1N1 flu. Obama wasn’t the first president who wanted to end the program. President George W. Bush tried the same thing in his FY 2007 budget proposal. A 2001 study by RAND had said the program’s structure was ""profoundly flawed."" University of New Hampshire researcher Todd DeMitchell told us that Obama’s budget reflected a different strategy. ""The emphasis appears to have shifted to a broader perspective of improving the culture and climate of the school with an increased focus on bullying, health, character and possibly less emphasis on hardening the school site,"" DeMitchell said. Cruz’s statement focuses on one budget decision by the Obama White House in 2010, but doing so ignores what happens in the years that followed. In 2013, after the killings of elementary schoolers and their teachers in Newtown, Conn., Obama rolled out a plan to prevent such slayings from happening again. The package was expansive, including an assault weapon ban and changes to the background check system. But specific to schools, it included $385 million in new spending. It offered ""$150 million to school districts and law enforcement agencies to hire school resource officers, school psychologists, social workers, and counselors."" There were $30 million for schools to design emergency management plans, and $40 million ""to help districts work with law enforcement and other local agencies to coordinate services for students who demonstrate need."" There were at least $75 million aimed at boosting mental health interventions at schools. Like the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program, the proposal covered a lot of ground, but it had more big-ticket line items aimed at violence alone. It is worth comparing Cruz’s plan to put $300 million into school safety. He sought $30 million a year for a decade to pay for more police to protect schools. Obama’s plan called for $4 billion to pay for 15,000 more police officers. Of course, neither plan -- Obama’s nor Cruz’s -- became law. Cruz and Grassley have re-introduced their bill. As a final budget note, Obama ultimately ended the Safe and Drug-Free School program entirely, and folded it into a new program called Successful, Safe, and Healthy Students. Cruz said the Obama administration cut $300 million in school safety money. That fits with the elimination in 2010 of the formula-driven Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities State Grant program. A fuller look at Obama’s proposed 2010 budget puts the cut around $200 million. In addition, Cruz ignores that in 2013, Obama called for $385 million to respond directly to mass shootings in schools, and $4 billion to hire an additional 15,000 police officers. Cruz’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. Update: After we published, we heard from Cruz's office.

Are Americans already benefiting from the new tax law?
","U.S. Rep. Chris Collins said many Americans are already benefiting from the tax law Republicans in Congress passed in December. Collins used the claim to attack House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in a tweet. ""Because of #TaxReform, 4 million American workers have received raises and bonuses, and 90% of Americans are seeing bigger paychecks this month,"" Collins tweeted. ""Despite what @NancyPelosi may say, this isn’t ""crumbs"" for hardworking families in #WNY."" Pelosi had previously called the tax benefits for middle- and low-income earners ""crumbs"" compared to what wealthy earners would receive. Republicans who support the tax plan disagree. They believe the tax bill provides significant relief for those workers. Collins, a Republican from suburban Buffalo, says those benefits have already started. Is he right? ‘4 million American workers’ President Donald Trump claimed 3 million workers in the U.S. had already received a pay increase or bonus thanks to the tax bill at the end of January. PolitiFact rated that claim Mostly True. PolitiFact checked Trump’s claim using data from Americans for Tax Reform, a group that advocates for lower taxes. The group supported the Republican tax bill. The group has a running list of companies that have announced bonuses or other benefits based on press releases and media reports since the tax law passed. At the end of January, at least 286 companies had announced benefits for more than 3 million workers. That number has since grown to more than 4 million workers from 408 companies, according to the group. Those workers have gotten a bonus, pay increase, 401(k) hike, or utility rate cut because of the new tax law, according to reports. That’s not a small number of workers, but it accounts for less than 3 percent of the total employed population in the U.S. Experts also told PolitiFact that some of the bonuses may have already been planned before the tax law to retain workers in a tight labor market. Larger paychecks  The second part of Collins’ claim is based on a prediction from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The agency said in January that 90 percent of working Americans would have less federal tax withheld from their paychecks by the middle of February. Employers had until Feb. 15 to implement the lower federal tax rates. ""We’re estimating that 90 percent of workers are going to see an increase in take-home pay because of the Tax Cuts [and Jobs] Act,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said. We reached out to the agency to see if its prediction panned out for February. We did not hear back. The actual share of workers with more take-home pay may be lower than 90 percent, according to Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. ""It is true that roughly 90 percent of Americans will get a tax cut this year as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,"" Gleckman said. But many Americans will not see higher take-home pay because of other factors, like higher health insurance premiums. Higher premiums could exceed any increase in take-home pay. Premiums for individual and employer-sponsored health plans are expected to rise again this year. An argument could be made that without the new tax rates, employees would have less money to pay for the higher premiums. More benefits from the law will be available during next year’s tax filing period. That’s when other provisions begin, like a higher standard deduction for filers. Our ruling Collins said ""Because of #TaxReform, 4 million American workers have received raises and bonuses, and 90% of Americans are seeing bigger paychecks this month."" The first part of Collins’ claim is correct based on a compilation of companies from a tax cut advocacy group. PolitiFact used the same list when fact-checking Trump on a similar claim. The second part of Collins’ claim is less clear. The Treasury Department predicted 90 percent of workers would have lower federal taxes in February. We don’t know how many had higher take-home pay, Gleckman said. The statement is accurate but needed additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

West Virginia Senate candidate says Barack Obama is banning new coal power plants
","Voters across Appalachia are hearing one message from Republican candidates in a handful of Senate races: President Barack Obama is killing coal. In West Virginia, U.S. Rep. Shelley Moore Capito became the latest to deploy the tactic; Capito is running against Democrat Natalie Tennant for U.S. Senate. Capito comes out swinging against new federal regulations aimed at curbing carbon emissions from fossil-fuel burning power plants in an ad released July 29. ""The president's come out with rules that say 'no new coal-fired power plants,’ "" Capito says. ""But what he's going to come out with in the next several months is you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants."" We tackled the latter statement regarding existing facilities in a seperate fact-check and said it was False. Has the Obama administration banned new coal-fired plants, as Capito claims? EPA’s new regulations In September 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency, at the direction of Obama, released proposed rules for future power plants. Nowhere do they say, ""No new coal-fired power plants"" or anything similar. So taken literally, Capito’s comment is inaccurate. But let’s not stop there. What do the rules actually say? Under the proposed guidelines, coal-burning power plants would have to limit carbon emissions to 1,100 pounds per megawatt hour over a 12-operating month period. Natural gas plants, meanwhile, would have to stay below 1,000 pounds of carbon per megawatt hour. Modern natural gas plants already meet that standard, but so far even the most efficient coal plants in operation are well above the EPA’s proposed threshold. So while the rules don’t explicitly ban new coal plants, do the tough new guidelines effectively ban the fossil fuel? Capito’s campaign says it does. Obama’s ""proposed rule for new coal plants sets a standard that cannot be met without the use of carbon capture and storage technology,"" Capito spokeswoman Amy Graham said. This technology, she added, ""has not been demonstrated at a commercial coal-fired power plant anywhere in the United States."" That’s all actually true. The EPA even says the ""standards will minimize carbon pollution by guaranteeing reliance on advanced technologies like ... efficient coal units implementing partial carbon capture and storage."" Carbon capture and storage is exactly what it sounds like. Instead of releasing carbon into the atmosphere, power plants must capture and store it. The technology has been around for a while, but on a much smaller scale and not for entire power plants. It is a costly technology. According to Dallas Burtraw, associate director of the Resources for the Future Center for Climate and Electricity Policy, an energy think tank funded by government, nonprofits and energy companies, carbon capture is estimated to cost electric companies 15 to 20 percent more in the near future. The end of new coal plants? There are some promising developments with carbon capture technology. Southern Company, an energy provider, is already in the process of building a plant with carbon capture technology in Mississippi. The plant enjoys some special perks — including federal tax credits and proximity to an oil field that will pay Southern for its captured carbon to extract more oil — that make it somewhat unique. And there have been holdups. According to a Washington Post story, Southern Company pushed back the plant’s opening date by a year and the project has experienced significant cost overruns. But so far construction is proceeding as planned. Burtraw said the high costs to get the plant up and running are not uncommon for trailblazers trying new technologies. Usually, costs decrease as competition increases and the building and manufacturing becomes more efficient and standardized. The EPA pointed us to three proposed projects in North America, including two in the United States, that will include carbon capture and storage. In truth, coal plants face a much greater threat than regulation: Natural gas. Natural gas is much cheaper and a more efficient fuel source than coal, luring energy companies away from coal at a fast pace. ""Coal is getting really beat up badly in the market by cheap gas,"" said Michael Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at The University of Texas at Austin. ""Over the last few years, new power plants have been dominated by natural gas, wind and solar."" Burtraw added: ""There were not going to be any new coal plants built anyway. That is the real ringer here."" Amy Jaffe, executive director of Energy and Sustainability at the University of California, Davis, added that energy demands across the country have stabilized, meaning there are few emerging markets where new plants of any kind are needed. That also dampens prospects for new coal plants. Obama’s regulations create another disadvantage for coal that, at least in the interim, makes it more expensive than natural gas. In that sense, Burtraw said, the new restrictions, in practice, ""sort of lock in the current trend,"" but they don’t create it. Nor does that spell the end for coal entirely. The price of carbon capture technology should fall in the future as it becomes more commonplace. When it does, Burtraw said it will be a ""gamechanger."" Coal may have other long-term economic benefits over other resources as well. ""Wind and solar have benefits, but they’re intermittent. Natural gas is subject to all sorts of price volatility, at least historically, and it’s subject to hurricanes that can cause disruption,"" Webber said. ""So people will see coal is domestic, it has value, it’s not as volatile, it’s stable, but you just can’t burn it the way you did before."" Our ruling Capito said, ""The president's come out with rules that say, 'No new coal-fired power plants.' "" The rules do not explicitly ban future coal plants, so already this is an exaggeration of what the EPA has proposed. While the future of coal is uncertain, it has much more to do with energy markets and the rise of natural gas — a cheaper and more efficient energy source — than Obama’s regulations. The stricter carbon standards from the EPA may create additional barriers to building new facilities. But already there is one attempt to build a facility that would meet these thresholds and experts expect it won’t be the last. The test facing coal is real, but Capito goes way too far in her indictment. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/aug/07/shelley-moore-capito/west-virginia-senate-candidate-says-barack-obama-b/

Did Rand Paul propose cutting off aid to Israel?
","Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took a trip to Iowa in early August, hoping to gain support in the key presidential caucus state. But Paul ended up attracting some controversy. Yahoo! News reported that when Paul was asked whether he thought the United States should phase out aid to Israel, he answered, ""I haven’t really proposed that in the past. We’ve never had a legislative proposal to do that. You can mistake my position, but then I’ll answer the question. That has not been a position — a legislative position — we have introduced to phase out or get rid of Israel’s aid. That’s the answer to that question. Israel has always been a strong ally of ours and I appreciate that. I voted just this week to give money — more money — to the Iron Dome, so don’t mischaracterize my position on Israel."" (He made his comments in neighboring Omaha, Neb.) A chorus of commentators, relying on comments he made early in his Senate tenure, charged that Paul was rewriting history. For instance, Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz tweeted, ""Rand Paul has absolutely supported ending US aid to Israel, and he needs to stop trying to rewrite history."" So was Paul correct when he said, ""I haven’t really proposed (phasing out aid to Israel) in the past""? We took a closer look. Back in 2011, when Paul was just settling into the Senate, he proposed a budget that was more fiscally conservative than the proposals offered by his Republican contemporaries. In a bid to cut $500 billion from the federal budget, Paul proposed a spending outline that would have eliminated foreign aid entirely. Paul’s cuts weren’t targeted at Israel specifically, which gets about $3 billion a year from the United States, mostly in military assistance. But by cutting all aid to foreign countries, Paul’s proposal would have zeroed out Israel’s aid. Paul’s 2011 budget proposal wasn’t easy to locate on the Web, but using the Wayback Machine -- an Internet archive -- we were able to find a 65-page budget proposal released by Paul’s office in March 2011. Citing a pattern of squandered and unwise spending on foreign governments, the report offered a straightforward bottom line on foreign aid: ""Eliminate all international assistance."" His proposal went on to address the situation of Israel specifically, leading off the section with a quote from Stanford University economist Alvin Rabushka: ""Free money is the scourge of Israel’s economy. It is the difference between a free, prosperous Israel and a statist, dependent Israel."" The section on Israel says this: ""While this budget proposal does eliminate foreign aid to Israel, it is not meant to hurt, negate, or single out one of America’s most important allies. This proposal eliminates all foreign aid to all countries. Israel’s ability to conduct foreign policy, regain economic dominance, and support itself without the heavy hand of U.S. interests and policies, will only strengthen the Israeli community. The elimination of all foreign aid, including provisions to Israel, is not necessarily a new idea. In 1996, during an address before the U.S. Congress, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that his nation would eventually wean itself from dependence on U.S. foreign aid. Prominent Israeli politicians and economists alike have called for the end of foreign aid. Among them is economist Amon Gafney, who served as governor of the Bank of Israel from 1970 to 1981. He pointed out that foreign aid has caused Israel to suffer from ―Dutch Disease, a situation in which a generous gift brings short-term benefits but impairs a country’s long-term competitiveness."" In the run-up to the release of this budget document, Paul defended his zeroing-out strategy for foreign aid -- and its effect of ending aid for Israel -- in at least three separate interviews. The Wolf Blitzer interview. Paul sat for a Jan. 26, 2011, interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. Here’s an excerpt: Blitzer: ""You want to end all foreign aid as well, is that right?"" Paul: ""Yes, and in fact, the other day Reuters did a poll, 71 percent of American people agree with me that when we're short of money, where we can't do the things we need to do in our country, we certainly shouldn't be shipping the money overseas. …"" Blitzer: ""What about the $2 billion or $3 billion that goes every year to Israel? Do you want to eliminate that as well?"" Paul: ""Well, I think what you have to do is you have to look. When you send foreign aid, you actually (send) quite a bit to Israel's enemies, Islamic nations around Israel get quite a bit of foreign aid, too."" Blitzer: ""Egypt gets almost the same amount?"" Paul: ""Almost the same amount, so really you have to ask yourself, are we funding an arms race on both sides? I have a lot of sympathy and respect for Israel as a democratic nation, as a fountain of peace and a fountain of democracy within the Middle East. But at the same time, I don't think funding both sides of the arms race, particularly when we have to borrow the money from China to send it to someone else. We just can't do it anymore. The debt is all-consuming and it threatens our well being as a country."" The Jonathan Karl interview. Then, on Feb. 3, 2011, Paul sat for an interview with ABC News’ Jonathan Karl. Here’s a portion of their conversation: Paul: ""I’m not singling out Israel. I support Israel. I want to be known as a friend of Israel, but not with money you don’t have. We can’t just borrow from our kids’ future and give it to countries, even if they are our friends. ... I think they’re an important ally, but I also think that their per capita income is greater than probably three-fourths of the rest of the world. Should we be giving free money or welfare to a rich nation? I don’t think so."" Karl: ""And you think they can handle their own defense?"" Paul: ""I think they’re probably 10 years ahead of any neighboring country. I think their defense is very significant, and I think probably well in advance of any of their potential enemies."" Karl: ""Would you leave any foreign aid intact?"" Paul: ""No."" Karl: ""None?"" Paul: ""No. I just don’t think you can give people’s money away when we can’t rebuild bridges in our country."" The Dave Weigel interview. Slate.com blogger Dave Weigel interviewed Paul at the conservative CPAC conference. ""People emphasize too much the cuts to one particular country,"" Paul told Weigel, referring to Israel. ""We had $500 billion of cuts. The cuts to that one particular country were three-fifths of 1 percent of it."" • • • Interestingly, the public and media skepticism about Paul’s proposal to end all foreign aid, including aid to Israel, led the senator to backtrack. Paul’s own website includes a second version of Paul’s budget proposal, dated May 2011 -- two months after the first one was released. This one treats foreign aid differently. First, the new proposal scraps the section on Israel in its entirety. Indeed, Israel isn’t mentioned anywhere in the 65-page document. And second, Paul’s new bottom line for foreign aid wasn’t to cut it to zero. Rather, the proposal said, ""Freeze foreign aid funding at $5 billion."" Though the report doesn’t say so explicitly, that would have been enough to cover the outlays for Israel. This provides strong evidence that Paul, after taking fire for his foreign-aid policy in January, February and March 2011, abruptly reversed course. This approach -- keeping some foreign aid in the budget -- appears to be what Paul pursued in the version of his budget that actually got voted on by the Senate. The Senate voted down Paul’s proposal, with just seven voting in favor and 90 against. Paul’s office didn’t respond to a query for this article, but after commentators began to question the seeming inconsistency of his positions earlier this week, his office released a statement to media outlets. The most relevant part for this fact-check is this: ""Sen. Rand Paul has never proposed any legislation that targeted Israel’s aid and just last week voted to continue and increase funding to the State of Israel. Sen. Paul is a strong supporter of the Jewish state of Israel. In 2011, Sen. Paul proposed a budget resolution that did not include certain foreign assistance programs in an effort to balance the budget in five years. Subsequent budget proposals made by Sen. Paul have included up to $5 billion for foreign assistance to account for U.S.-Israel security interests."" While the statement his office released is correct that Paul’s original proposal never targeted Israeli aid -- Israeli aid would have been swept up in the across-the-board nixing of all foreign aid -- this response doesn’t support the notion that he hadn’t ""really proposed (phasing out aid to Israel) in the past."" The record shows he did, both in writing and in interviews. Our ruling Paul said, ""I haven’t really proposed (phasing out aid to Israel) in the past."" That’s rewriting history. Not only did Paul say he would eliminate all foreign aid during multiple media interviews in January and February of 2011, but as late as March of that year, his office released a budget proposal that included a zeroing-out of foreign assistance, with a section specifically inserted to defend the effect that policy would have on Israel. Paul is free to change his position, but saying he never held the position in the first place is flatly contradicted by his past statements and documents. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2014/aug/07/rand-paul/did-rand-paul-propose-cutting-aid-israel/

Bloomberg: Africa spends more on education than any other part of the world
","Statesmen from nearly 50 African countries are in Washington this week for President Barack Obama’s historic African Leaders Summit, which has been billed as an attempt to strengthen the United States’ economic investments in Africa. Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg praised the summit on Aug. 3’s Face the Nation, pointing to investments from Chinese companies in African infrastructure. And education spending, Bloomberg said, is the best evidence of big things to come in Africa. ""China has looked at it and said this is a place where because they are spending highest percentage of their GDP on education of any part of the world, although in all fairness it's starting small,"" he said. ""But you are going to create a middle class there that's going to want an awful lot of the products."" ""The next big cities,"" he said, ""are going to be in Africa."" That seemed to contradict the Western trope that African schools aren’t meeting the needs of their students.  What we found is that Bloomberg is in the ballpark looking at data from 2008 but wrong when looking at more recent numbers. Looking back to 2008 While we didn’t hear from Bloomberg, he may have been thinking of an article in his Bloomberg Businessweek by Howard French, author of China’s Second Continent: How a Million Migrants Are Building a New Empire in Africa. ""African investment in education, among the highest in the world in terms of percentage of GDP, can barely keep up with the heavy demand for learning,"" French wrote, going on to cite Africa’s recent gains in school enrollment across all levels of learning. French referred us to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute, ""Lions on the move: The progress and potential of African economies."" That report pegs Africa’s public spending on education as a percentage of GDP at 5 percent in 2008. That’s ""a smaller portion than the OECD countries’ 6 percent,"" they wrote, ""but more than in Latin America or some Asian countries."" The OECD, or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,  is composed of 34 countries in every continent except Africa that are generally considered developed and high-income.      The above graph from a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) report expands on the data from the McKinsey study and looks at spending per region across the globe. Both reports, we should note, only look at public spending on education -- data on private education spending isn’t readily available for non-OECD countries. If you take education spending as a percentage of government spending, not GDP, Africa actually beats out the OECD, 20 percent to 11, according to the McKinsey Global Institute. But looking at 2008 figures -- as did all the reports we found that looked at education spending for continents -- Bloomberg’s wrong. Africa’s close, and their progress on education is impressive by other measures, but the world’s developed nations spend proportionally more on education. Updating the data But part of the buzz about Africa is that its governments are rapidly increasing their spending on education. For instance, a 2011 UN report noted that Africa had increased its education spending by an average of 6 percent a year from 2000 to 2010. The 2008 data also isn’t perfect, because some notable countries are missing, including China. So we set out to update the UN and McKinsey’s analysis with more recent data. Every year, UNESCO publishes public education spending as a percentage of GDP for every country where it’s available, which works out to less than half of the 196 recognized countries almost every year. The World Bank keeps a database of these numbers, year-by-year. To update the stats from UNESCO and McKinsey, we took the World Bank’s dataset and removed every country that hadn’t published new data since 2008. Then we took the most recent figure for the remaining 160 countries, and multiplied each country’s percentage by its most recent GDP figure from the World Bank to get an estimate for total education spending for each country. The data for every country is the most recent available, though the data isn’t the same year for every country. We then broke down the countries into geographic regions using a UN classification -- which segregates countries more or less by continents -- and took the total education spending for each region and divided it by each region’s total GDP to get weighted averages. The results:    Source: PunditFact.com As you can see from the chart above, Africa lags behind Latin America and Oceania, in addition to Northern America (the UN name for North America) and Europe. The picture could look different for education spending as a percentage of government spending instead of GDP -- African countries’ spending on education is increasing alongside their GDPs, albeit at a slightly slower rate -- but that’s not how Bloomberg framed his claim. Our ruling On Face the Nation, Bloomberg said that Africa is spending ""the highest percentage of their GDP on education of any part of the world"" in the course of praising China’s investment in Africa’s growth. Reports from the United Nations had Africa’s proportional spending on education higher than everywhere but North America and Europe in 2008. But since then, Africa’s overall economic growth has outpaced its governments increasing spending on education. Our calculations based on the most recent available data put Africa’s proportional spending beneath every continent except Asia. African countries do spend more of their governments’ budgets on education than many developed countries, so Bloomberg’s broader point about Africa’s growth has some merit. But Bloomberg’s claim cited GDP. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2014/aug/07/michael-bloomberg/bloomberg-africa-spends-more-education-any-other-p/

Rand Paul rightly says the government shutdown was more expensive than keeping it open
","This week, Rand Paul is on a 10-stop tour of Iowa, seen by many as a trial run for a 2016 presidential campaign. He’s been touting out his campaign positions, such as raising the retirement age and trying to play up his support for Israel. In a speech in Iowa City Tuesday, stumping for Republican House candidate Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Paul spoke about what he sees as out-of-control government spending. He also talked about the government shutdown last fall. Paul voted against the budget deals that led to the shutdown, but he said he thought shutting down the government was a ""bad idea."" And he carried the same position in Iowa this week. ""It cost us more to shut the government down than to keep it open,"" Paul said. ""You know your government’s dysfunctional if it costs more to shut it down than to keep it open, because we paid all these people."" Coming from someone like Paul, who has been known to oppose government spending, that comment intrigued us. (We noticed it when Yahoo! News political reporter Chris Moody, who was there, tweeted it out.) The economics Paul’s comment referred to the 2013 government shutdown, which lasted just over two weeks from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16. During those two weeks, up to 850,000 workers were furloughed per day, national parks shut their doors, government-funded scientific research halted, and various health and safety inspections -- out of agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration --  were put on hold. So how does not spending money come at a cost? ""Sen. Paul was making the point that the government never actually shut down during the so called 'shutdown,'"" a spokesman told us. ""Even though some government employees were furloughed, salaries were still paid for those who didn't work and government had to pay interest on late payments."" We found that this was true. The government still functioned partially during the shutdown, and furloughed employees got back pay. On top of doling out delayed payments, the government faced late payment penalties and other logistical costs associated with preparing or recuperating from two weeks of stalled activity. They also lost revenue from national parks and museums. But a more significant and documented blow was to the economy as a whole. We found a solid consensus among economists that the shutdown was expensive to the U.S. economy in terms of actual costs and lost productivity. The most thorough report examining the shutdown came out of Nov. 7, 2013, from the Office of Management and Budget, which reports directly to the president. (Paul’s spokesman pointed us to this New York Times article about the White House report as evidence.) Here’s a few highlights: $2.5 billion in compensation costs for furloughed workers (whose lack of pay for two weeks hampered consumer spending); 120,000 fewer private-sector jobs created in the first half of October; $500 million lost in visitor spending because of closed National Parks ; $11 million in lost National Parks and Smithsonian Institution revenue; Interest accrued on billions of dollars of payments owed to third parties that the government was unable to pay during the shutdown; Resources spent on putting activities in standby or maintaining them in an idle mode; 1.2 million Internal Revenue Service identity verification requests that couldn’t be processed, causing a delay in private-sector lending and other activities; Stalled approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration delayed moving products to market. We also found estimates from financial analytics companies in the private sector. All of these (about a dozen) showed a negative effect on the economy, though. Most of the estimates predicted that the shutdown would not affect the economy’s growth path substantially. (The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service compiled the reports in 2013.) Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, said the shutdown stunted fourth quarter GDP growth by 0.5 points, resulting in a $20 billion hit. The shutdown disrupted federal spending, global trade and investments in housing and businesses. Additionally, in the shutdown’s aftermath, consumers held back spending and foreign confidence in the American economy waned. Standard and Poor's said the shutdown took $24 billion out of the economy and reduced yearly fourth quarter GDP growth by 0.6 percent. (In December, the comic strip Doonesbury referenced this report, and we rated it Mostly True.) Macroeconomic Advisers (in a report for the Peterson Foundation) estimated the shutdown cut 0.3 points off of fourth-quarter growth, ""mainly by interrupting the flow of services produced by federal employees."" The Macroeconomic Advisers report said private-sector effects were limited, especially because the furloughed workers received back pay. Bloomberg News surveyed 71 economists and found the median GDP growth projection immediately after the shutdown was 0.4 points lower than a survey conducted a month earlier. The counterargument In consulting experts and scouring shutdown coverage, we found no economic modeling or analysis that showed the economy staying neutral or experiencing positive growth as a result of the shutdown. Some libertarians argue -- such as economist Jeff Dorfman for Forbes -- that just because the government didn’t spend money for two weeks doesn’t mean that the same amount of money didn’t get spent elsewhere in the private sector, though he did not provide data or other proof that this was happening. Dan Mitchell of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, made a similar argument, but offered a caveat -- that when government spending is suddenly reduced, the economy doesn’t instantaneously recalibrate itself, so there can be economic ""bumps"" in the immediate aftermath -- such as what was seen in the shutdown. Our ruling: Paul said, ""It cost us more to shut the government down than to keep it open."" Numerous independent economic research groups found that the shutdown resulted in overall costs, in terms of lost revenue, hindered GDP growth, stalled private-sector activity and actual expenditures associated with the logistics of closing the government for two weeks. The government had to pay all of what it normally would have spent during that two-week period and then some. There was very little evidence to the contrary.

Adler supporter's Mike Martinez money claim unsupported, ridiculous
","A supporter of an Austin mayoral candidate declared that another candidate accepts corporate donations--which would be illegal, he did not add. In a July 29, 2014, Facebook post, Eugene Sepulveda of Austin, treasurer for attorney Steve Adler’s mayoral campaign, declared Adler isn’t taking ""corp money, PAC money or bundled contributions,"" meaning money gathered from multiple sources by a single person. Commenting below Sepulveda’s post, Austin political consultant Mark Littlefield, who supports City Council member Mike Martinez for mayor, asked: ""Are other candidates taking corporate money?"" Sepulveda replied: ""Mike Martinez takes corporate money. Steve won’t."" A Martinez backer, Jose Velasquez, asked us to check Sepulveda’s claim.  We wondered first if perhaps laws have changed dramatically so that Texas candidates may accept corporate donations. Not so, we were reminded, in that Texas adopted its ban on corporate donations to candidates more than a century ago. A September 2013 Texas Ethics Commission guide for candidates for local office specified that state law bars contributions to candidates for state and local office from labor unions and most corporations. More recently, Austin lawyer Tim Sorrells, the commission’s former general counsel, advised candidates for city office in an April 2, 2014, blog post: ""In Texas, it is still a felony of the third degree for a corporation or labor organization to contribute directly to a candidate or a candidate committee."" We asked Sepulveda, a social entreprenuer and philanthropist, to elaborate on his Facebook statement. By email, he told us: ""I should have said Mike was taking money from business entities. I was referring to his acceptance of contributions from LLCs as well as PACs and bundlers."" LLCs are Limited Liability Companies. ""My bad for not being more specific,"" Sepulveda wrote. In another email, he said that when Velasquez asked him about the corporate claim, ""I used the term corporate generically, even referring him to the documents filed with the city clerk. If I'd been trying to mislead anyone, I certainly wouldn't have pointed them to the candidate-filed reports."" Sepulveda, who said he made his Facebook comments as an Adler supporter and not as a spokesman for Adler’s campaign, elaborated that according to a campaign-finance filing, Martinez fielded contributions from 13 businesses, which we confirmed from Martinez’s July 15, 2014, campaign finance report, which showed the cited contributions ranging from $50 to $350. We noticed the business contributors included several limited liability companies, which prompted us to ask an election-law expert, Trey Trainor of Austin, if such companies can legally give to candidates for local office. By phone, Trainor said LLCs may legally make donations so long as none of their members are corporations. Also by phone, Austin lawyer Ed Shack, who said he has helped Adler’s campaign, said the same. Martinez campaign spokesman Nick Hudson told us the campaign earlier confirmed from state records and by contacting each contributor that none of the LLCs giving to Martinez’s effort had corporate members. Hudson agreed it would be illegal for Martinez to accept corporate donations. Meanwhile, Sepulveda replied to us that he had since posted a comment on Facebook, below his original claim, stating he should have said Martinez accepted donations from business entities including LLCs rather than corporations. It appeared the afternoon of Aug. 4, 2014.  Our ruling Sepulveda said on Facebook that Martinez takes corporate donations. That’s not so. In fact, corporate donations remain forbidden and accepting such could lead to a felony charge. However, any candidate may field contributions from PACs and LLCs (so long as a donor LLC has no corporate members).

Group says Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke said calling 911 not best option
","A new TV ad by a liberal group uses Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr.’s own words to suggest he’s encouraging gun violence by discouraging use of the 911 emergency response system. ""I don’t dial 911,"" Clarke says in a clip featured in the ad. ""I will afterwards, to say ‘Come get this dead guy out of my house, he’s bleeding out and he’s messing up my carpet.’"" The ad ends with another excerpt from that interview: ""Point that barrel (at) center mass and pull the trigger."" At the top of the spot, a narrator says: ""Emergency responders. They risk their lives every day to help save ours. But Sheriff David Clarke says 911 is not our best option."" Does the new ad, paid for by the union-backed Greater Wisconsin Committee, accurately reflect Clarke’s views? Specifically, has Clarke advised citizens to ""point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger"" because ""911 is not our best option?"" A familiar controversy Clarke faces Milwaukee Police lieutenant Chris Moews in the Democratic primary for sheriff on Aug. 12, 2014. The new ad resurrects a controversy that began in January 2013 when Clarke’s office paid for a radio announcement in which he said: ""With officers laid off and furloughed, simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best option. You can beg for mercy from a violent criminal, hide under the bed, or you can fight back. But are you prepared?"" That prompted a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story with this online headline: ""Sheriff David Clarke’s radio ad says 911 not best option, urges residents to take firearms classes."" After Clarke’s radio spot, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett criticized him, saying if there’s an emergency, ""I want people to call 911"" but Sheriff Clarke is ""discouraging people from calling 911, it’s just wrong."" About six weeks later, Clarke sat for a long interview with Project Veritas, a conservative group. that posted it online. The snippets of Clarke speaking in the Greater Wisconsin ad are from this interview. In that interview, Clarke said that Barrett had ""contorted"" the message in his radio spot by suggesting that he was advising that nobody call 911. The sheriff explained that it’s up to individual citizens to decide for themselves what they will do when confronted with possible harm. At the same time, Clarke made it clear not only what he personally would do, but what he would advise as the best course of action for citizens. He spoke in the context of potentially immediate danger, an example being an intruder breaking into your home. Twice he said the ""advice"" he would give people was based on what he himself would do: ""Use cover, because you don’t know if that clown trying to break into your house is armed. Know who and what your target is. Point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger."" He does not mention calling 911 in that sequence. Then he concludes: ""You see, the thing is 911 in that situation is not going to help you and that’s why I said it’s not your best option."" So the ad, notably, gets the ""not your best option"" context right. The other Clarke quote in the Greater Wisconsin Committee ad is from a section of the Project Veritas interview in which Clarke talks more about what he personally would do in that situation. Clarke tells the interviewer that a sign hangs on his own home picturing the head of a Rottweiler and a semiautomatic handgun with the message: ""We don’t dial 911."" ""I don’t call 911,"" Clarke explained. ""I will afterwards, to say ‘Come get this dead guy out of my house, he’s bleeding out and he’s messing up my carpet. And that’s not to sound, you know … that’s just the reality. I’m not going to fool around with that. But that’s the mindset I have but I’ve been a cop for 35 years, so I live with that every day and it becomes second nature..."" The sheriff, at that point in the interview, shifts back to what he’d like law abiding residents to consider doing. Government shouldn’t tell them what to do, he said. ""I trust them to make those decisions as to what to do,"" Clarke said. ""If they want to blow a whistle, fine, I don’t tell them not to."" But he made clear that he feels the best option is not waiting around for the police, or hiding under the bed, or running away. ""I don’t think that’s going to be very effective in some of these situations,"" Clarke said. ""So I want people to think about what’s going to be effective. If you want to run out of your house, fine, I’m not running out of my house unless it’s on fire. That’s my house, and I’m not running from it to give the bad guy carte blanche."" Ad vs. reality So how does the Greater Wisconsin ad compare to Clarke’s statements? The ad, despite the length limitations, gets Clarke’s message right and places it in the context -- using Clarke’s own words -- of a home invasion situation. Neither Clarke nor the ad is saying the sheriff suggests that calling 911 is never a good idea. (Clarke, in the interview, at one point seems to suggest he wants average citizens to call 911 if they can -- but then take matters into their own hands rather than wait for police to arrive). The other Clarke quote in the ad -- ""point the barrel center mass and pull the trigger"" -- is in fact Clarke’s advice to citizens. He says a 911 call isn’t  always possible and by itself isn’t effective because of long wait times for police. When we asked Clarke to respond to the ad, he said he stands behind what he said to Project Veritas and did not intend to watch the Greater Wisconsin ad. Clarke said he suspected the ad twisted his remarks, but he couldn’t recall the specific context of his comments in the interview cited in the ad, and he offered no specific criticisms. ""My position is clear,"" Clarke said. Our rating A Greater Wisconsin Committee ad said Sheriff David Clarke advised citizens to ""point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger"" because ""911 is not our best option."" Clarke did just that in an interview, and made similar comments in an earlier radio spot and in comments to PolitiFact Wisconsin.

A. Ralph Mollis says per-pupil costs at Blackstone Valley charter school exceed Cumberland's
","Charter schools have stirred national and local debate since the first ones opened in the 1990s. Supporters claim they provide greater options and promote higher achievement. Opponents claim many charters don’t measure up to those promised achievements, and strain municipal budgets. The issue arose during a July 10, 2014, ""State of the State Debate"" between two of the three Democratic candidates for lieutenant governor: Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis and Cumberland Mayor Daniel J. McKee. (State Rep. Frank Ferri, also a candidate, did not participate.) The focus: The Blackstone Valley Prep Mayoral Academy. McKee is the current chairman of the academy’s board. Mollis, a charter school skeptic, focused on costs, saying, ""The per-pupil cost at the mayoral academy far outweighs the per-pupil costs in Cumberland public schools."" Mollis continued: ""One of the major issues right now is what’s happening in public education -- that we’re not providing enough funds and resources into our public education system, that entities like the mayoral academies are taking money from our public school system …"" Some background: Charter schools are independently run public schools that are granted greater flexibility in their operations, in return for greater accountability for performance. Mayoral academies are regional charter schools whose boards are chaired by a mayor. Blackstone Valley Prep was started in 2009 as ""an intentionally diverse"" network of tuition-free public schools. Chartered by the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE), Blackstone Valley Prep enrolls students from Central Falls, Cumberland, Lincoln and Pawtucket: There are currently some 1,000 students in grades K-8. A high school is set to open in the fall with 100 ninth-grade students. We started our fact-checking by looking at RIDE statistics. RIDE reports  per-pupil costs for all public schools in the state by adding up total budgets and dividing by the number of students. It uses a ""Uniform Chart of Accounts,"" a standardized method by which every district, public charter school and state-operated school tracks revenue and expenses the same way. RIDE says that allows ""for an apples-to-apples comparison between districts."" Contrary to what Mollis said, RIDE’s figures show that Blackstone Valley’s per-pupil costs were actually LESS than Cumberland’s in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. However, in fiscal years 2010 and 2011, -- the charter’s first two years -- Blackstone Valley’s costs were significantly higher. (The fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30.) Here are the numbers: FY 2010: Cumberland $11,007. Blackstone Valley Prep: $15,664. FY 2011: Cumberland $10,905. Blackstone Valley Prep: $15,408. FY 2012: Cumberland: $12,294. Blackstone Valley Prep: $11,716. FY 2013: Cumberland: $12,280. Blackstone Valley Prep: $12,054. RIDE spokesman Elliot Krieger said the costs are ""equalized,"" by subtracting capital costs and debt service from those who report it through the school budget - ""the only fair way to compare districts."" Krieger says, ""Our pupil expenditure data does not support that [Mollis’] statement."" That seems pretty straightforward, right? But when we asked the Mollis campaign to back up his statement, campaign manager Nicholas Cicchitelli directed us to RIDE ""revenue-per-pupil"" figures - not cost-per-pupil - as ""black-and-white support"" for Mollis’ claim. Cicchitelli said that’s a more valid figure to use because it ""shows how much money taxpayers are actually paying per pupil to the Mayoral Academy vs. what they pay to Cumberland public schools per pupil."" But hang on a minute. First, in the debate, Mollis said ""cost per pupil,"" not ""revenue per pupil."" And second, revenues are actually ""money coming in,"" versus expenditures - which is money spent. The revenue is from all sources - local, state, federal, and ‘other,’ such as grants and donations, says Krieger.(In May, for example, BV Prep received a $450,000 grant from Next Generation Learning Challenges to launch its high school this fall). Cicchitelli also said that Mollis did not use the term ""per pupil expenditure"" because RIDE ""includes some things and excludes others which distorts the true cost. For example, debt service is manipulated … "" Seeking clarity, we contacted the Cumberland School District. Alexander Prignano, district business manager, offered this view: ""The latest RIDE numbers are right,"" he said. ""They do show BV and maybe two others are lower [than Cumberland.] But to say that without looking behind the numbers is misleading."" Prignano said per-pupil costs at charter schools are typically lower ""because they don’t have the special ed population that a public school will have, and special ed students are very, very costly to educate."" Another example: mayoral academies are exempt from the state’s pension system, he said. We asked Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council - an independent, nonprofit and nonpartisan public policy research and education organization - to weigh in. Executive director John C. Simmons said RIDE provided RIPEC with data for per-pupil expenditures and per-pupil revenue, ""which allowed us to compare the two schools over time."" ""We would say you should look at the cost per student as opposed to where the money came from,"" Simmons said. He noted, for example, ""You can get grants and contributions that are not taxpayer money."" Simmons also said it’s not surprising that Blackstone Valley’s costs per pupil in its first few years were high because of the expense of starting a new school, spread out among relatively few students -- 76 in the beginning. And it’s not surprising that those costs ""would decline rapidly as the number of students increases."" Simmons said, ""It looks like during the first two years of transition, Blackstone spent a considerable amount more [per pupil] than Cumberland did. When you look into the more norming years, Blackstone Valley spent less than Cumberland by a couple hundred dollars."" Our ruling Ralph Mollis said: ""The per-pupil cost in the Mayoral Academy [Blackstone Valley] far outweighs the per-pupil cost in Cumberland public schools."" That’s a pretty sweeping claim. And it’s only true for the school’s first two years, when start-up costs, spread over a relatively small number of students, would be high. It’s not true for the more representative last two years, when the Academy’s per-pupil costs were lower, not higher. The efforts of the Mollis campaign to consider ""revenue per pupil"" didn’t sway us. It’s not the same thing and it’s not what Mollis said. Because Mollis’ statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

Actor James Woods: Obama ordered the release of Islamic State leader
","When James Woods isn't busy acting and doing voiceovers for video games and Family Guy episodes, he tweets from the right-end of the political spectrum. One of his latest messages revives the inaccurate claim that President Barack Obama let the head of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) slip through our fingers in 2009. ISIS, which has simplified its name to Islamic State, is the well-armed Sunni force that has claimed broad swaths of land in Iraq. Recently, it defeated seasoned, if ill-equipped, Kurdish forces in battles for two key towns. On Aug. 5, Woods, no fan of Obama, tweeted to his 145,000 followers, ""The leader of ISIS was imprisoned by American troops and ordered released to Iraq by Obama administration in 2009."" Woods followed that up with, ""Clearly Obama did not hand select the leader of ISIS for release to the Iraqis in 2009. Obama's weak kneed foreign policy is the issue."" We looked at an almost identical claim about the head of Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in June. Baghdadi was held by U.S. forces at a detention facility in Iraq called Camp Bucca, but not when Woods said. According to the Defense Department, Baghdadi was released in 2004, not 2009. ""Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Al Badry, also known as 'Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi' was held as a 'civilian internee' by U.S. Forces-Iraq from early February 2004 until early December 2004, when he was released,"" the Pentagon told us in a statement. ""He was held at Camp Bucca. A Combined Review and Release Board recommended 'unconditional release' of this detainee and he was released from U.S. custody shortly thereafter. We have no record of him being held at any other time."" In short, according to the Defense Department, the man who heads Islamic State was set free in 2004, long before Obama took office, and he was not recaptured. How did the 2009 version get started? In mid June, there were several articles -- from Slate, and NBC among others --  that placed Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2009 (when Obama would have been president). However, all the talk tracked back to a Daily Beast interview with Army Col. Kenneth King, the former commander of Camp Bucca. That article said King knew Baghdadi at the camp and that he didn’t expect to see him become the leader of a spectacularly vicious and brutal movement. ""I'm not surprised that it was someone who spent time in Bucca but I'm a little surprised it was him,"" King said. ""He was a bad dude, but he wasn't the worst of the worst."" In this storyline, Baghdadi was handed over to Iraqi justice system late in 2009 shortly before Camp Bucca closed. ABC News questioned King’s recollection, citing a ""a U.S. official"" that Baghdadi was not in American custody in 2009. ""I could be mistaken,"" King told ABC News, ""but I’m 99 percent. He’s a dead ringer for the guy I had the run-in with … His face is very familiar."" King declined to comment to PunditFact. For the record, even if King's memory is better than the Defense Department's paper trail, Obama didn’t order Baghdadi released as much as enforce an agreement brokered by President George W. Bush. Before Bush left office, his administration signed a contract between the United States and Iraq that guaranteed that the United States would give up custody of virtually every detainee. Our ruling Woods said Obama ordered the release of the leader of ISIS, now called Islamic State, in 2009. The Defense Department says the release took place in 2004 and Obama had nothing to do with it.

Rep. Lynn Jenkins blames Harry Reid for 'do-nothing Senate'
","Members of Congress recently decamped to their home districts for the August recess, but the never-ending partisan skirmishing on Capitol Hill continues. Many readers told us they saw references on social media to a comment by Rep. Lynn Jenkins, R-Kan., about House-passed bills dying on the doorstep of the Senate. They asked us to take a closer look, so we did. Here’s the full text of Jenkins’ comments, made at a press conference on July 29, 2014, as the final week of the congressional session was winding down: ""The president is fond of referring to the House as the ‘do-nothing Congress.’ But we have 352 reasons why it’s a ‘do-Nothing Senate.’ ""352 bills are sitting on Harry Reid’s desk, awaiting action. ""98 percent of them passed with bipartisan support -- Republicans and Democrats working together to pass legislation. ""50 percent of the bills passed unanimously, with no opposition. ""70 percent of the bills passed with two-thirds support in the House. ""And over 55 bills were introduced by Democrats. ""352 bills. Why won’t Harry Reid act? These are good bills; bills that put the American people back to work, put more money in hardworking Americans pockets, help with education, and skills training. We call upon Harry Reid to get to work before he adjourns in August to pass some of these bills. The American people deserve better."" Jenkins offered a lot of statistics in a short statement, so to keep this fact-check manageable, we’ll focus on her claim that in the ""do-nothing Senate,"" there are 352 House bills ""sitting on Harry Reid’s desk awaiting action,"" including 55 introduced by Democrats.   Have 352 bills passed the House but await action in the Senate? Basically, yes. We used the THOMAS congressional database to pluck out the 733 measures that have passed the House so far this year. We then weeded out a few categories of bills -- ones that, for procedural reasons, were never intended to go to the Senate (such as election of the Speaker, assignment of lawmakers to committees, and procedural motions) or ones that were subsequently taken up by the Senate (either being passed or rejected). What remained were 342 individual bills. That’s 10 fewer than what Jenkins claimed, but we have no quarrel with her number, since the difference likely stems from additional bills being passed in the couple of days between when she spoke and when we looked through the database. Are these bills ""sitting on Harry Reid’s desk awaiting action""? Resolving this claim is murkier. First, a technical problem. It’s an oversimplification to say that these bills are ""sitting on Harry Reid’s desk."" Many have been assigned to committees, where they would need to be approved before being taken up on the floor. While Reid has influence over what committee chairs do, a chair can -- using their own powers -- decide to either fast-track or stall a bill coming over from the House. Another complication: In at least some cases, the Senate is working on a bill on the same topic, but without using the House bill as a starting point. ""The disposition of a House bill is not particularly relevant to measuring Senate legislative activity,"" said Steven Smith, political scientist and Senate specialist at Washington University in St. Louis. We should also note that in the Senate, one member -- either from the majority or the minority -- can stop a bill in its tracks by threatening to filibuster -- a delay that requires 60 votes to break. Reasonable people can disagree about whether Reid or Senate Republicans are the biggest offenders -- we previously addressed some of those issues -- but the experts we checked with said both parties share at least some of the blame. ""There's plenty of blame to go around,"" said Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican House aide now studying Congress at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Wolfensberger sees Reid as the bigger offender by blocking bills and amendments ""to protect his vulnerable members who are up for re-election in November. You can blame the threat of filibusters and politically sensitive amendments from Republicans, but politics ain't bean bag. Senators were sent there to cast the tough votes, not to be pampered, protected and coddled by their leaders."" Others see Republican threats as the bigger problem. ""It is true that some bills, including some of substance, are being blocked by Reid from action because he wants to avoid Republican amendments of the ‘gotcha’ variety that could work against some of his endangered incumbents up this fall,"" said Norm Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ""You can make a case that the role of the majority is to suck it up and do votes, even if some are uncomfortable. But on the balance sheet, the bigger reality is that very few of the bills passed by the House were aimed at compromise or agreement with the Senate."" A spokesman for Jenkins, Thomas W. Brandt, told PolitiFact, ""Only Sen. Reid can bring these bills up for a vote, and if he did, it would go a long way in ending the legislative gridlock currently plaguing Washington."" Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Reid, countered by noting that there are 50 bipartisan Senate-passed bills awaiting House action. (Here's the list.) Do the House-passed, Senate-stalled bills include 55 introduced by Democrats? On the number, Jenkins is basically right -- we counted 54. But if this statistic is intended to communicate how generously the House treats its minority caucus, Jenkins’ talking point is somewhat overblown. Unlike the Senate, where the minority party and individual lawmakers hold notable leverage, the House is structured -- regardless of which party is in power -- as a tyranny of the majority. Whoever has the most votes and holds the Speaker’s gavel determines which bills get considered, and precisely how they get considered. Minority-party preferences are granted, if at all, as a favor from the majority. The number of Democratic-sponsored bills Jenkins mentions -- 55 -- accounts for just 16 percent of all House-passed bills now awaiting consideration in the Senate. But even that figure is misleadingly high. When we took a closer look at the 55 Democratic-sponsored bills that passed the House, we found that fewer than half -- 24 -- could reasonably be described as substantive. And many of these were the kinds of measures lawmakers would be hard-pressed to vote against -- for instance, the National Pediatric Research Network Act of 2013, the Homes for Heroes Act of 2013, the Traumatic Brain Injury Reauthorization Act of 2014, the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2013, the Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act and the Human Trafficking Prevention Act. The remainder of the 55 Democratic-sponsored bills -- a majority -- aren’t exactly the most high-profile measures pending in Congress. Thirteen were technical changes to local federal lands; five approved honorific names for postal or other buildings; four addressed federal studies or advisory committees; three were bills sponsored by a non-voting territorial delegate; three concerned narrow technical corrections to existing legislation; one concerned U.S. coinage; and one was a private bill granting an immigrant visa to an individual. So House bipartisanship lives, but let’s not oversell it. Why the numbers don’t tell the whole story Experts say this bill counting merits a grain of salt. As the breakdown of the 55 Democratic-sponsored bills suggests, many of the measures that pass the House -- and some that go on to pass the Senate -- are noncontroversial bills. Wolfensberger crunched the numbers for us and found that of the 570 bills and joint resolutions that have passed the House in the current Congress, 377, or 74 percent, originated as suspension bills -- a streamlined process used for non-controversial measures that requires two-thirds approval. And of the 142 measures signed into law by Obama, 118, or 83 percent, were approved by that same two-thirds requirement. Meanwhile, many of the other bills that pass the House in today’s environment are bills that are intended to make a statement, not a law. Ornstein contrasted bills that are ""designed to lay the predicate for action via compromise"" or consensus, which are declining, and those ""designed for show or as a political statement, where there is neither intention nor expectation that the other house will act on them."" Where substantive, contentious legislation is concerned, the odds of passage are poor. One example is the Senate-passed (and bipartisan) immigration bill, which remains stuck in the House. Another sign is the fact that the Senate has not yet passed any of the 12 annual appropriations bills -- even though the House has passed seven and the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved eight. By contrast, the second category of ""show"" bills includes dozens of full or partial repeals of the Affordable Care Act passed by the Republican House. Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution, said a fundamental reality of today's political landscape is that ""the two chambers' majorities have different agendas and priorities and different ideas of what constitutes a 'problem.' And even when the parties agree on the need to address an issue, their prescriptions differ. That complicates the legislative process, and in the current period of high partisanship, it seems most often to bring the legislative process to a halt."" Our ruling Jenkins said that in the ""do-nothing Senate,"" there are 352 House bills ""sitting on Harry Reid’s desk awaiting action,"" including 55 introduced by Democrats.   In some cases, committee chairs -- not Reid -- may be blocking or moving slowly on these bills. In other cases, senators are working on their own alternative bills on the same topic. Meanwhile, the claim oversells the degree of bipartisanship in the House; a majority of the Democratic-sponsored bills she cites are relatively minor pieces of legislation. Ultimately, Jenkins places all the blame on the Democrats and the Senate, but experts agree that it takes two to tango. Both parties and chambers have played a role in creating the current legislative dysfunction. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/06/lynn-jenkins/rep-lynn-jenkins-blames-harry-reid-do-nothing-sena/

Website: Obama mandated detention for people with respiratory illness linked to Ebola
","The arrival of two Americans infected with the Ebola virus at an Atlanta hospital has ginned up the fear mill and the conspiracy website Infowars.com has fused fear of infection with fear of Big Brother. When the first American was admitted to Emory University Hospital’s special infectious disease treatment center, Infowars.com wrote, ""United States officials brought an affected (sic) patient into the country only days after President (Barack) Obama signed an executive order mandating the detention of Americans who show signs of ‘respiratory illness’."" At another point, the article says Obama’s latest executive order ""mandates the apprehension and detention of Americans who merely show signs of 'respiratory illness.' "" The article correctly reports that President Barack Obama signed an executive order on July 31, but beyond that, the accuracy quotient falls rapidly. As for the Ebola patients, government officials did not bring them back to America, as Infowars said. While the State Department facilitated the paperwork for the medical evacuations, these people arrived in a private chartered jet paid for by the religious charities they worked for, Serving in Mission and Samaritan’s Purse. At a news conference, Bruce Johnson, the president of Serving in Mission USA, said his group has spent about $1 million on the two patients since their illness was discovered. Second, and more important for this fact-check, is what the executive order says. It's much more targeted than the article describes, it isn’t aimed at Ebola, and while it allows health officials to quarantine someone with a highly contagious disease, it does not mandate it. On July 31, Obama modified a 2003 executive order from President George W. Bush. The original listed the communicable diseases for which the Department of Health and Human Services was authorized to issue an isolation or quarantine order. Bush specifically mentioned Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a disease associated with ""fever and signs and symptoms of pneumonia or other respiratory illness."" Obama updated the particular reference to SARS to include a broader array of possible respiratory illnesses. The new text reads as follows: ""Severe acute respiratory syndromes, which are diseases that are associated with fever and signs and symptoms of pneumonia or other respiratory illness, are capable of being transmitted from person to person, and that either are causing, or have the potential to cause, a pandemic, or, upon infection, are highly likely to cause mortality or serious morbidity if not properly controlled. This subsection does not apply to influenza."" To be clear, the update has nothing to do with Ebola or the current outbreak. Ebola is not a respiratory disease (the most prominent signs are diarrhea and vomiting) and the original 2003 executive order already listed Ebola. The White House press office told PunditFact that the change was aimed at Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), an illness with symptoms that do match the updated executive order. More critically for our examination, the updated order does not ""mandate"" the apprehension and detention of people who show signs of respiratory illness. Wendy Parmet, a law professor at Northeastern University School of Law, is one of three legal scholars who prepared a report for the American Civil Liberties Union that warned about overreach by the government in responding to pandemics. While Parmet said the new text is very broad, it has clear limits. ""It only applies to those with symptoms of a disease that have caused or have the potential to cause a pandemic, or have the potential of causing mortality or serious morbidity,"" Parmet said. ""I wouldn’t think the typical cold would apply."" In fact, the order specifically excludes the flu. What happens if you do have Ebola, or MERS, or one of the other afflictions specified in the executive order? Title 42 United States Code Section 264 gives the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to isolate an infected person. The department must determine that a person presents a risk to public health. Its authority is limited to people as they enter the country or attempt to travel from one one state to another. In other scenarios, the power to isolate or quarantine individuals rests with the states, Parmet said. Our ruling Infowars.com said Obama’s latest executive order ""mandates the apprehension and detention of Americans who merely show signs of ‘respiratory illness.’"" That’s a fundamental misreading of the executive order Obama signed and the power the federal government has. The updates Obama made to a 2003 executive order do not mandate the apprehension and detention of people who show signs of ""respiratory illness,"" has nothing to do with the current Ebola crisis and only affect people entering the country or crossing state lines.

With Ivy Taylor, San Antonio is largest U.S. city to ever have African American female mayor
","San Antonio’s onetime mayor, Henry Cisneros, offered praise when the Alamo City’s City Council chose Council Member Ivy Taylor to serve out Julián Castro’s term as mayor. The July 22, 2014, council action was touched off by Castro leaving to become U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development, a post also previously held by Cisneros. Cisneros reacted in a statement we spotted on Twitter: ""The decision by our City Council to select Ivy Taylor to become mayor of San Antonio for the next year underscores once again San Antonio’s place as one of the most inclusive and fair-minded cities in America. I believe we are now the largest city in the United States ever to have an African-American mayor."" Is that so? We emailed Cisneros asking how he reached his assessment and also reached out to the Washington, D.C.-based National League of Cities, which describes itself as a research and advocacy group for 19,000 municipalities. A league administrator, Jim Brooks, responded by phone, noting first that because San Antonio is among the nation’s 10 most-populous cities, this claim has a limited scope. As of July 1, 2012, according to the U.S Census Bureau, San Antonio’s nearly 1.4 million residents placed it seventh nationally in population behind New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia and Phoenix. (It's worth keeping in mind the bureau's city population estimates don't take into account surrounding metro areas.) Brooks said Baltimore, Md., has an African American woman as mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, initially sworn in Feb. 4, 2010, according to a City of Baltimore web page. Brooks noted, too, that Shirley Franklin, an African American, is the former mayor of Atlanta. Franklin, who now teaches at the LBJ School of Public Affairs, was Atlanta’s mayor from 2002 to 2010. Each of those cities is home to far fewer residents than San Antonio. As of July 2012, according to the bureau, Baltimore had about 622,000 residents; Atlanta was home to an estimated 443,000-plus residents. Based on his 25 years working on city issues, Brooks said, he was unaware of mayors who would disprove Cisneros’ statement. We reached another person with perspective, E. Faye Williams, the president/ceo of the National Congress of Black Women. Williams said by phone the cities larger than San Antonio haven’t had African American female mayors. She also suggested we mention Sharon Pratt Kelly, the mayor of Washington, D.C., from 1991 through 1994, according to a February 2014 compilation of city leaders by Washingtonian magazine. The district’s estimated population as of July 2012 exceeded 633,000, the bureau says. By telephone, Cisneros noted another mayor we hadn’t already tallied, Sharon Sayles Belton, who led Minneapolis from 1994 to 2002, according to a 2013 web post by The Uptake, an online news operation. That city’s estimated population as of July 2012 was nearly 400,000, the bureau says. Our ruling Cisneros said San Antonio is the largest U.S. city to ever have a female African American mayor. True.

And history’s not on Donovan’s side, the alderman told supporters July 29, 2014, when he announced his bid. ""What we are proposing is monumental and also unprecedented,"" Donovan said. ""As a matter of fact to the best of my knowledge there has never been an alderman who has defeated an incumbent mayor in the history of this great city."" Milwaukee’s modern-day tendency to return incumbents to office is well documented: it’s been almost 75 years since a mayor fell (Carl Zeidler stunned Daniel Hoan in 1940). But never’s a long time. No alderman has ever dethroned a mayor? To the history books We took up Donovan’s history challenge, looking back to the early days of city government, when aldermen received no salary and worked out of a church and above a livery stable. Milwaukee has elected a ""boy mayor"" (flashy 29-year-old Sherburn Becker, 1906). It has backed  mayors born in Germany, Ireland and France. It voted in a mayor (Zeidler) whose surprising win was engineered by the future writer of ""Psycho."" The city’s voters have made a mayor of the man who wrote the ""Peck’s Bad Boy"" books (George W. Peck), and have tapped surgeons, liquor peddlers, judges, congressman, bankers and many lawyers to the post. Democrats are the rule, but a few Republicans have broken through. But relatively few aldermen even have run against an incumbent. The last to try, unsuccessfully, was Rod Lanser in the 1968 primary. Mayor Henry Maier won a third term and served until 1988. The last to win a mayor’s race as an alderman: Emil Seidel (1910), owner of a small pattern shop. Seidel is remembered not for that, but for starting the city’s half-century of mainly Socialist Party mayors. He made a national splash, becoming the first Socialist to run a major U.S. city. But Seidel didn’t defeat a sitting mayor. He tried, but in 1908 lost narrowly to David S. Rose, described by historian John Gurda as ""a political prince of darkness who allowed prostitution, gambling dens, all-night saloons and influence-peddling to flourish on his watch"" while fighting off criminal charges. Rose wasn’t re-nominated by the Democrats in 1910, and Seidel defeated Republican physician John Beffel (""Dr. Good Government""). Like Donovan, Seidel was fond of meeting constituents in taverns. so much so that ""Seidel"" became a nickname for a beer mug, Martin Hintz recounts in ""A Spirited History of Milwaukee Brews & Booze."" Back to Donovan’s claim that since the city charter was signed in 1846, no alderman has defeated a sitting mayor. Echoing Donovan, to the best of our knowledge, he is correct. We examined newspaper archives and the Milwaukee Public Library’s ""Milwaukee Mayors"" digital collection. We consulted with the city’s Legislative Reference Bureau’s library manager, Eileen Lipinski, Gurda and Milwaukee City Clerk Jim Owczarski.  We reviewed races up to the present day. Only a handful of aldermen or former aldermen have advanced to the mayor’s office, and none against an incumbent, Lipinski found after combing through records kept by the non-partisan research agency. A tough challenge What makes the leap from alderman to mayor so tough? After all, there’s only a couple hundred feet separating their second-floor offices in Milwaukee’s 119-year-old City Hall downtown. ""Most alderman are very familiar to voters in their districts,"" offered Donovan. ""But not citywide."" There’s also a general fear among alderman about taking on any sitting mayor, for fear of losing and suffering retribution in terms of help for their districts, Donovan said. ""I’m not accusing the mayor,"" said Donovan, who intends to run for both mayor and his district seat simultaneously. ""That’s always a concern of aldermen. We’re only as good as what we can deliver."" Donovan might not find as much comfort from Seidel’s example if he digs into the deep background on the Socialist. Seidel, we found, was elected in 1908 as an ""alderman at large,"" which meant he had a citywide constituency, rather than representing a smaller geographical area. Our rating No Milwaukee alderman has defeated an incumbent to become mayor, according to Donovan. It’s relatively rare for aldermen or former aldermen to run for mayor. It’s even more rare for them to win. And none has ever bested a sitting mayor, experts agree.

Medical marijuana opponents say drug often involved in fatal car crashes
","Medical marijuana opponents are taking to the streets to oppose Amendment 2, citing statistics that drugged driving would be a major side effect to legalizing cannabis. Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot, a coalition of more than 40 organizations fighting against the proposed medical marijuana amendment, says on its website that the drug is implicated in a fourth of all fatal accidents. ""Twenty five percent of all drug-related fatal vehicle accidents in the U.S. involve marijuana,"" the group says under the header ""Statistics"" (the number is repeated on an infographic on the site). Was marijuana a factor in a quarter of all fatal car accidents involving drugs? PolitiFact Florida hit the books to see what Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot was driving at. For the record First of all, we have to note this check began when we noticed on Aug. 4, 2014, that the Statistics page actually had the sentence, ""25 percent of all fatal vehicle accidents in the U.S. involve marijuana."" That certainly sounded like too much to us, so we asked the group about it. Eric Pounders, spokesman for the Florida Sheriffs Association, responded to our questions that evening by saying the statement included the phrase ""drug-related."" That’s not what we read, but it’s what the site says now. Pounders concluded that although the prior phrasing had been used as recently as three months ago, it had been clarified to be more accurate. He told PolitiFact Florida we may have ""encountered a previous version of the site that had been temporarily restored to fix an issue."" In any event, he said the 25 percent stat came from an October 2011 White House Office of National Drug Control Policy report that measured the rate of positive results among drivers that had been tested for drugs in fatal crashes between 2005-2009.  The study used National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Fatality Analysis Reporting System data of accidents across 50 states in which the driver was killed and subsequently tested for drugs. The report noted that of the roughly 127,000 fatal crashes in that time frame, almost 78,000 drivers were tested for drugs. Winnowing down those results, positive tests for cannabinoids rose steadily from 22.6 to 26 percent between 2005 and 2008, dropping slightly to 25.3 percent in 2009. There are some problems with that data. First of all, there is no set procedure or uniform level of toxicity for drug testing among the states, as laws and protocols vary widely. The report says ""a positive test result does not necessarily imply impairment or causation,"" and says testing often is inaccurate. Furthermore, data in which a driver may have been using drugs but survived a crash in which someone else died is not included. There is often no universally accepted threshold of impairment for illicit drugs, the White House report says. There also is some question as to whether the specific presence of cannabinoids, including the main psychoactive chemical component, tetrahydrocannabinol, is an accurate indicator of impairment. The NHTSA states, ""It is difficult to establish a relationship between a person's THC blood or plasma concentration and performance impairing effects."" That’s in part because cannabinoids linger in a person’s system long after they’ve ingested the drug. ""Marijuana, unlike alcohol and most other drugs, stays in a person’s system for up to 30 days,"" says Ben Pollara, spokesman for United for Care, the group promoting Florida’s Amendment 2. ""So its presence in a person’s blood is not an indicator that they were impaired at the time of the accident."" That 25-percent figure seems to track with other studies of drug-related fatal crashes, however. One 2011 study from the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation in Calverton, Md., examined fatal single-vehicle accidents between 1998 and 2009 that involved speeding, failure to obey or yield, inattention and failure to use a seat belt. That study found about 23 percent of those crashes involved cannabinoids, although the study adds the caveats that the drivers’ drug levels were not available, and those deaths most often involved speeding and the driver not using a seat belt. When you change the parameters of the research, the numbers vary. A 2014 Columbia University study looking at six states reported marijuana was present in 12 percent of accidents in 2010, up from 4 percent in 1999.   A University of Colorado School of Medicine study released in May 2014 comparing Colorado to 34 other states concluded marijuana was present in 10 percent of fatal accidents by the end of 2011, as opposed to 4.5 percent at the beginning of 1994. But yet another study from 2012 from universities in Oregon, Montana and Colorado measured crashes in medical marijuana states. The study found that while instances of drugged driving went up in those places, total fatal accidents dropped somewhere between 8 and 11 percent overall. The possible reason, in a nutshell? Most people probably smoke their weed at home instead of driving home drunk from a bar, the study’s authors hypothesized. Alcohol still remains the most abused substance involved in fatal drug-related accidents -- as high as 60 percent, depending on the year and study. Montana State University economics professor D. Mark Anderson, one of the authors of the study showing a decrease in fatalities, said that the numbers didn’t supply a direct link between marijuana use and accidents. Indeed, none of the research PolitiFact Florida cited above claimed to establish a definite cause and effect. ""Maybe 25 percent of all people involved in fatal vehicle accidents also drank milk for breakfast,"" Anderson said. Our ruling Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot said, ""25 percent of all fatal drug-related vehicle accidents in the U.S. involve marijuana."" Some other research backs up that number, although the studies are limited in scope and descriptiveness. Reports usually don’t show whether marijuana use was the cause of the accident or how long ago the drug was ingested, and are limited in several other ways. Marijuana, for example, can be detected in person’s system for weeks after ingestion. The study cited by the group also only measured drivers that died and were tested for drugs, a very specific scope that doesn’t tell the whole story. Experts warned it’s not wise to imply causation among marijuana users in fatal crashes, but a 25 percent rate of involvement has been established in some studies.

Do women own 1% of the world's land? No
","Women around the world have a hard row to hoe, but do they really own just 1 percent of all the land? That’s the claim in a tweet from Oxfam Ireland. A reader saw Oxfam’s infographic with the stat and asked us to check it. We’ve found similar statements about global poverty to lack a firm grounding in the facts (70 percent of the world’s poor are not women) and that’s the case with this one, too. Sorcha Nic Mhathuna, a spokeswoman for Oxfam Ireland, the national chapter of the worldwide anti-poverty group, said her organization is ""reviewing"" this factoid. ""We are aware that this statistic is the subject of substantive debate,"" Mhathuna said. Still, Mhathuna could point to some very big organizations that have taken this number as settled fact. In 2012, the World Bank published a report on women, business and the law which said, ""UN Women (the United Nations office focused on women’s issues) informs us that ""women perform 66 percent of the world’s work, produce 50 percent of the food, but earn 10 percent of the income and own 1 percent of the property."" But the source the World Bank cited is a defunct Web page at the United Nations from a UN division that no longer exists. Oxfam Ireland also listed a 2013 joint report from UN Women and the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights that said, ""it is reported that just 1 percent of the world’s women actually own land."" The source for that? A line from a Web page at the International Center for Research on Women, a group based in Washington. That Web page provided no source and when we contacted the center, they directed us to a 2002 brochure from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization that also offered no supporting data. What the (limited) numbers say For all the references back to UN Women, someone forgot to ask the professionals there who know the data. Papa Seck, a statistician in the Research and Data Section at UN Women, said there are no global figures on land ownership. ""I can tell you for sure that this is not a valid statistic,"" Seck said. Agnes Quisumbing, a senior fellow with the International Food Policy and Research Institute, a group focused on pragmatic solutions to hunger and poverty, has pushed back against this stat. In 2013, Quisumbing co-authored an article on gender and land ownership in Africa. Quisumbing and her colleagues noted that measuring land ownership is hardly as simple as it sounds. A woman might have the right to farm a plot of land but not be able to sell it without permission from relatives. Husbands and wives might hold joint title. On top of the need to define what it means to own land, much of the information simply doesn’t exist. Few surveys ask about land ownership at all and those that do often don’t ask about gender. After looking at the best studies they could find, Quisumbing and the others decided that any statement at the global or even regional level would be a ""gross oversimplification."" That said, using research from eight African countries, they found that women were generally less likely to be landholders, but the range was large. In Mali, women represented about 3 percent, in Ethiopia, about 18 percent and in Cape Verde, 50 percent. The authors underscored a common misinterpretation when looking at gender and ownership: The percentage held by women does not mean that men control the rest. In South Africa’s Natal Province for example, 10 percent of women had their name on an ownership document, but the number for men was 29 percent. The bulk of the land might be owned by the community, the government or some other entity. In March, Cheryl Doss, a development economist at Yale University, used an Oxfam blog to criticize advocates for using the claim that women own a tiny percentage of land. ""Women’s land rights are critically important,"" Doss wrote. ""Yet, using unsubstantiated statistics for advocacy is counterproductive. Advocates lose credibility by making claims that are inaccurate and slow down progress towards achieving their goals because without credible data, they also can’t measure changes."" Doss offered some statistics that advocates could use. ""On average, across 10 countries in Africa, 39 percent of women and 48 percent of men report owning land, including both individual and joint ownership. Only 12 percent of women report owning land individually, while 31 percent of men do so."" Broadly speaking, the pattern holds true in Central and South America. Carmen Diana Deere is a professor in the Latin American Studies department at the University of Florida. Looking at who owns which parcel of land, Deere found that in Mexico, women owned about 20 percent of the parcels, men owned 66 percent and 14 percent were held jointly. That was the high water mark for female ownership in Deere’s study. At the other end of the spectrum, in Honduras, women owned 12 percent and men owned about 87 percent, with about 1 percent held jointly. But even in Honduras, the figures refute the Oxfam Ireland claim. Deere said she and others have made this general point since at least 2001. Quisumbing expressed some frustration about Oxfam Ireland’s use of the errant stat. She had brought this up with the American chapter of Oxfam at a meeting in Boston in mid April. ""I gave a seminar at Oxfam with a lot of people videoconferenced in and yet these myths prevail,"" Quisumbing said. The origins of the 1 percent claim As near as anyone can tell, this factoid emerged in 1978. In a 2013 article debunking this myth in The Atlantic, University of Maryland sociologist Philip Cohen, tracked it back to a paper published by the International Labor Organization titled ""Women at Work."" Cohen reported that the paper’s author said her numbers were ""based on some available global data, and others derived by use of fragmentary indicators at the time."" Lacking hard data, she made broad assumptions that women earned so much less than men that ""it can be assumed that they normally do not have any surplus to invest."" In other words, the 1 percent statistic about land was a guess. And it stuck. Our ruling Oxfam Ireland circulated a graphic with the claim that women own 1 percent of the world’s land. The organization cited well-known bodies such as the World Bank and the United Nations, but none of those sources offered hard evidence. In fact, several pointed back to UN Women, and statisticians there reject this figure. The data that do exist suggest that women own much less land than men but the situation varies widely from country to country. Plus, the statistic implies that whatever land women don’t own, men do, and that is hugely incorrect.

Townhall editor claims U.S. agency can shut down a business for any reason
","Don’t feel too bad if you’ve never heard of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It’s the new kid in Washington, as far as government agencies go, created by the passage of the 2010 massive financial regulation overhaul known as Dodd-Frank. The bureau, which opened in 2011, has rulemaking powers, supervises certain financial institutions and checks out complaints from consumers about lending practices that may violate the law. An editor of the conservative news website Townhall claimed it has more nefarious aims. A reader asked us to look into the thrust of a June 19 story by news editor Katie Pavlich, also a Fox News contributor and conservative author, who said the agency granted itself authority to shut down businesses for basically any reason. ""Last week the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, through the power of Dodd-Frank, passed a rule giving the agency unprecedented power to shut down businesses, no matter what the reason, at any time it wishes through a cease-and-desist order,"" Pavlich wrote. That seemed like a lot of unilateral power, so we wanted to look into her claim. Federal rulemaking fun We tried to reach Pavlich through email and Twitter, but she did not respond. Her article links to a post on CFPB Monitor, a blog maintained by the Ballard Spahr law firm, about the agency adopting a final rule on temporary cease-and-desist orders. Just one problem: The cease-and-desist order isn’t what Pavlich thinks it is. One of Ballard Spahr’s attorneys told us the rule Pavlich referenced is not meant to gut businesses’ rights and is typical of other federal and state financial regulators. ""It’s not like a blank check to put somebody out of business,"" said Christopher Willis, a Ballard Spahr partner and consumer finance attorney who represents financial institutions that would be subject to the rule. ""It’s supposed to be tied to stopping someone from violating the law."" Here’s how Willis explained it to us:  When the agency thinks a business has broken the law, the agency can file a lawsuit, pursue administrative proceedings or do a cease-and-desist order. But a cease-and-desist order is to cease-and-desist violating the law -- not to stop existing. Moreover, the agency didn’t give itself the power to issue cease-and-desist orders, Congress did. Section 1053(c) of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act allows the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to conduct cease-and-desist proceedings. So, in September 2013, the agency developed an interim rule that spells out how to do what Congress wanted. Essentially, the rule says the agency’s director may issue a temporary cease-and-desist order when he or she finds a company’s alleged unlawful action will render it unable to pay debts or ""otherwise prejudice the interests of consumers."" An earlier CFPB Monitor post equated this kind of order with a temporary restraining order in a judicial proceeding. The order is enforceable once served. The agency published its final rule June 18, effective July 18. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received just one public comment about the regulation, which appears to have been intended for the Food and Drug Administration. Power with precedent  So we know the agency didn’t just assign itself this power. But there are more issues to address with Pavlich’s claim that the rule gives the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ""unprecedented power to shut down businesses, no matter what the reason, at any time it wishes."" Is the cease-and-desist authority unprecedented? Not really. Other banking agencies have had this power for a long time, Willis said. Agency spokesman Samuel Gilford sent us an alphabet soup of federal financial regulators with similar power, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve, OCC and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, as well as many state banking regulators (see examples in Texas, Connecticut, North Carolina). Can the agency shut down businesses for any reason? The agency is tasked with overseeing a large amount of businesses -- mainly payday lenders, non-bank mortgage lenders, banks and credit unions with assets over $10 billion, and private student loan lenders. Still, we’re not talking about mom and pop’s pizza shop. The agency can only go after the businesses it’s tasked with overseeing. Gilford said the agency has not yet issued a cease-and-desist order. But when it does, it can’t just do it for any reason. ""Any temporary cease-and-desist order issued by the CFPB must describe the basis for the order, the alleged violations of the law, and the harm that is likely to result without the issuance of an order,"" Gilford said. That said, the agency is powerful and operates with more autonomy than other agencies, Willis said. Its budget is not controlled by Congress, and its director is insulated from the political process after the president appoints him or her. ""So there’s a lot of criticism against the agency for lack of democratic accountability,"" Willis said. ""But it has nothing to do with cease-and-desist programs."" Our ruling Pavlich recently wrote for Townhall, ""the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, through the power of Dodd-Frank, passed a rule giving the agency unprecedented power to shut down businesses, no matter what the reason, at any time it wishes through a cease-and-desist order."" She is mistaken, an attorney who represents the financial services industry told us. Pavlich ignores several key facts about the agency’s temporary cease-and-desist authority. Namely, it’s not unprecedented, it’s not issued without reason, and it’s meant to stop violations of law, not the business altogether.

Ad says Joni Ernst pledged to protect tax breaks for companies that outsource
","It’s back! A claim out of the Democratic Party that numerous fact-checkers debunked in 2010 has made its way to the 2014 Iowa Senate race. A new ad attacks Republican candidate Joni Ernst, painting her as beholden to special interest groups because she signed a pledge. The ad comes from NextGen Climate Action Committee, a liberal political action committee. The ad shows a dimly lit room, with two men looking at a picture of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on a screen, while laughing in a slow, almost crazed manner. The screen switches to a picture of Ernst. ""We got her to pledge? Joni signed on the line,"" the ad says. ""The tax breaks that thing protects are gold. Green light more outsourcing! China, Mexico. All the way."" Text on the screen says, ""Ernst’s Pledge: Protects Tax Breaks for Companies that Ship Jobs Overseas."" Even though the ad is new, this claim -- that a person who signs the Americans for Tax Reform’s pledge is in favor of tax breaks that encourage outsourcing -- is not. In 2010, PolitiFact Virginia checked a similar statement, that a state legislature candidate ""supports the tax loopholes that send American jobs overseas."" They rated the claim False. The same year, our friends at Factcheck.org found the claim, used against a Republican House candidate from Hawaii, to be false. And they pointed out that pro-Democratic groups that used the attack ads in quite a number of ads. The Associated Press also said the claim was wrong in 2010. It seems like there’s a consensus that the claim is off-target, but because it’s been four years, we decided to look at it again. What’s this pledge? The pledge that the ad is talking about the Taxpayer Protection Pledge -- crafted by Americans for Tax Reform, Grover Norquist’s anti-tax group, in 1986. Lawmakers who sign it pledge to fight tax increases. Ernst signed the federal pledge back in July 2013. Democrats say this means Ernst and other signers pledge to protect tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas. That’s a stretch. For one, the text of the pledge is brief and does not take positions on specific issues, like protecting companies with employees in other countries. It says nothing about jobs or changing tax code. It says: I, ______, pledge to the taxpayers of the ______ district of the state of ______ and to the American people that I will: One, oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses; and Two, oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates. Democrats have said Americans for Tax Reform has pressured signers to vote in ways that would prevent closing tax benefits for companies that conduct business overseas. NextGen Climate pointed us to Americans for Tax Reform’s stance on a bill that provided $26 billion in aid to states and localities. In August 2010, Americans for Tax Reform said the bill (H.R. 1586, which passed) violated the Taxpayer Protection Pledge. The bill included increased spending that would be paid for in part by closing tax loopholes for American companies that do business overseas. The changes didn’t specifically address workers or where employees are located. NextGen Climate is essentially arguing that because Americans for Tax Reform told pledge signers not to vote for this bill all pledge signers support outsourcing protections. We see two primary issues with this evidence. First, Americans for Tax Reform’s main problem with the bill is that it eliminated a tax credit without finding another avenue to reduce taxes by the same amount, which the pledge requires. People who sign the pledge wouldn’t support any tax increase or tax credit elimination, no matter the context, so it is misleading to tie their tax positions to other issues like outsourcing, said Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a think tank. ""They wouldn’t close a (tax) subsidy to bring jobs home, either,"" Toder said. In theory, signers could have voted for the 2010 bill if it had eliminated other taxes to make up for closing the loopholes. Second, this particular vote happened in 2010, almost three years before Ernst signed the pledge, and she was not in an elected position at the time -- let alone in a position in which she would have voted on this bill. She has no ties to this legislation. Our ruling An ad by NextGen Climate Action Committee said Ernst signed a pledge that ""protects tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas."" Ernst signed the Taxpayer Protection pledge, a promise promoted by Americans for Tax Reform, which is a broad vow to oppose all tax increases. It does not specify protecting tax loopholes for companies that have employees overseas. In one instance, Americans for Tax Reform urged signers to vote against a bill that closed one of these loopholes, but the decision was more about stopping a tax increase than protecting outsourcing, and Ernst had yet to sign the pledge then, anyway.

Gwinnett claim hurt by comparisons
","Gwinnett County government is expected to collect $20 million more in general fund property taxes this year as a result of rebounding home values. County commissioners could give the money back to homeowners by rolling back the tax rate an equivalent amount. But they’ve decided it’s more prudent to leave the millage rate unchanged and put the extra money into projects that were put off during the worst of the Great Recession, such as a new roof for the main government complex. They point out that even with the $20 million, the county will be collecting $40 million less than it did in 2009, when property tax collections were at their peak. In recent discussions of the millage rate, Commission Chairman Charlotte Nash said county government has made ""significant cutbacks in staffing."" A PolitiFact Georgia reader asked if Nash’s statement could be truth-tested. We were  glad to oblige. PolitiFact reached out to Joe Sorenson, communications director for Gwinnett County government, who provided data and documents back to 2008, when local governments were just starting to feel the fallout of the national economic down spiral. Based on that information, here’s what happened. Gwinnett County government imposed a hiring freeze in 2008 and eliminated a net of 179 positions a year later. The Planning and Development Department took the hardest hit. New building had stopped. Rezoning requests essentially had evaporated and, with them, the need for 84 of the department’s 154 jobs. Some other employees’ jobs were cut. Another 202 workers, with a combined 4,400 years of experience and institutional knowledge, accepted retirement incentives to leave. The police and fire departments left 25 positions vacant, although some other critical jobs were filled, Sorenson said. (The situation also was grim in Gwinnett’s private sector. In the first three quarters of 2009, more than 18,000 jobs were eliminated. The local unemployment rate shot from 5.6 percent to 8.9 percent in a single year.) The county’s tax rate was increased in 2009, and some of the extra revenue was used in 2010 to increase staffing, primarily in public safety (48 new jobs in fire and emergency management services and 50 new police positions). In 2011, the hiring freeze of 2008 was changed to a 90-day freeze on vacant positions. That policy remains in effect today and, by the county’s projections, is saving $8.9 million a year. The policy requires that vacant county jobs be held open for three months and only be refilled after their need is justified to the county administrator.   Year Population Authorized Positions Ratio per 1,000 residents 2004 687,468 4,152 6.04 2005 710,978 4,391 6.18 2006 740,267 4,586 6.20 2007 764,129 4,797 6.28 2008 780,721 4,893 6.27 2009 796,276 4,714 5.92 2010 808,291 4,827 5.97 2011 824,941 4,815 5.84 2012 842,046 4,812 5.71 2013 855,459 4,825 5.64 Source: Gwinnett County Communications Department This year, the county added one new position, for an authorized workforce of 4,826. That’s 67 fewer workers than the 4,893 the county had in 2008, when the government was serving 90,000 fewer residents. But can a 1.4 percent reduction in staff be called significant? Nash told us that her comments related to the number of full-time county employees per 1,000 residents, which she county officials for several years have considered a more accurate measure of staffing levels. ""There is certainly validity to the general idea that service demands go up as the population increases,"" Nash said. From 2008 to 2013, the number of authorized full-time county employees per 1,000 residents dropped from 6.27 to 5.64, a 10-percent reduction, she said. ""The significance of the 10 percent reduction is even greater when I look at the allocation of authorized positions across the organization,"" Nash said. ""Authorized positions for Public Safety, Sheriff and the Judiciary grew by 124 positions from 2008 to 2013 while authorized positions for the rest of the county departments and offices shrank by 192 positions."" Officials at the Georgia Labor Department and the National Association of Counties provided data to help us see what’s been happening in other governments across Georgia and the country. The Labor Department data shows that in Georgia: -- the number of people working in fulltime and part-time federal jobs increased by 1,900 or about 2 percent from 98,200 in 2008 to 100,100 in 2013, the latest year for which data is available; -- the number of fulltime and part-time state workers dropped by 9,500, or 5.2 percent, from 183,500 in 2008 to 174,000 in 2013; -- and in local governments, the number of fulltime and part-time workers dropped 21,500, or about 5 percent, from 429,200 in 2008 to 407,700. Across the nation, counties cut 91,000, or 2.7 percent of their full-time works, going from 3.345 million workers in 2007 to 3.254 million workers in 2012, said Emilia Istrate, director of research and outreach for NACo. In metro Atlanta, we also reached out to officials in DeKalb, Cobb and Fulton counties. Burke Brennan, spokesman for DeKalb County, sent us data showing that the number of full-time workers in the county fell 14.5 percent, from 7,309 in 2008 to 6,251 in 2014 and all workers, including temps and part-timers, dropped from 7,649 to 6,427 or about 16 percent. Cobb County is down from 4,409 employees in 2008 to 4,213, or 4.4 percent, currently, said Robert Quigley, county spokesman. Meanwhile, the number of full-time employees in Fulton County has dropped about 18.3 percent, from about 6,327 in 2008 to 5,168 in 2014, according to data from the county’s IT department. Steve Anthony, a political science lecturer at Georgia State University who focuses on Georgia government policies and practices, said the staff reductions in Gwinnett cannot be called significant. ""Getting rid of 1 percent of what you have is not significant,"" he said. ""The loss of personnel there was less than anywhere else, and significantly less."" Katherine Willoughby, a professor in the Department of Public Management and Policy at Georgia State’s Andrew young School of Policy Studies, said, however, that even a small cut in staff can be tough. ""A 1.4 percent cut to the government workforce, especially in light of an increasing population, is very challenging,"" Willoughby said. So where does that leave us? Gwinnett County does have 67 fewer employees and 90,000 more residents now than it did in 2008. In better times, the county likely would have added 100 to 200 new employees a year to meet the demands of a growing population. But it’s probably a stretch to say the cutback in employees is ""significant"" given the downsizing that’s occurred across the public and private sectors.
