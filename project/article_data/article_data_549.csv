Joe Biden says that closing Amtrak's Northeast Corridor would force I-95 to expand by seven lanes
","
In a Feb. 8, 2011, speech at Philadelphia’s 30th Street Station, Vice President Joe Biden -- who as a U.S. senator commuted almost daily to and from his home in Delaware using Amtrak -- touted rail as an integral part of the nation’s transportation future.

During his address, he made a striking comment: ""If you shut down Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, it's estimated you'd have to add seven new lanes to I-95 to accommodate the increased traffic."" (It wasn’t the first time he made the comparison; he also included in an article he wrote for Amtrak’s Arrive magazine.)

For readers who hail from outside the northeastern U.S., we should explain what the Northeast Corridor is. Though definitions vary, the one we’ll use is the passenger rail line Amtrak uses from Washington, D.C., to Boston, with stops in such major cities as Baltimore; Wilmington, Del.; Philadelphia and New York. It is heavily trafficked by commuters and inter-city travelers -- more than 10 million riders in 2010.

Interstate 95 runs from Maine to Florida. The relevant portion for Biden’s comment is the stretch that mirrors the Northeast Corridor, running from Washington north to Boston.

When we asked Biden’s office to back up the claim, they said that the numbers came from the Transportation Department. Specifically, Biden’s office said, 5 billion passenger miles are traveled in the Northeast Corridor every day by rail, including both intercity rail and commuter rail, with an additional 14.5 billion vehicle miles traveled on I-95 between Washington, D.C., and New York City. Using these numbers, Biden’s office said, eliminating all trips by rail could increase volume on I-95 by 23 percent.

Biden's office added that the claim factors in population growth over the next 40 years, which is projected to increase volume on I-95 by 80 percent. So the combination of eliminating rail and accommodating future growth would result in roughly a doubling of demand on I-95. Accommodating that demand during peak periods would require a doubling of I-95’s current average size of seven lanes between Washington and New York City.

Steven E. Polzin, director of mobility policy for the Center for Urban Transportation Research at the University of South Florida, consented to do his own back-of-the-envelope analysis for us, using a different methodology. 
He said that a freeway lane can handle 1,800 to 2,000 cars per hour. If each car holds the national average of 1.6 people per vehicle, that means that each lane can accommodate up to 3,200 persons per hour. An eight-coach, two-locomotive Amtrak train has a capacity of 400 riders. So Amtrak would would need to run eight trains per hour to equal the capacity of one freeway lane. (That's more than actually run now: Amtrak often runs two trains an hour from Boston to Washington and another two in the opposite direction, plus some additional trains that travel shorter portions.) 
Using current Amtrak ridership numbers, Polzin got a similar result -- that eliminating Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor would require one new lane in each direction.

Either way, it’s less than one-third of what the Transportation Department study suggests.

""That suggests that the seven-lane number uses some real different assumptions,"" Polzin said. For instance, he said, if you use Amtrak’s 2050 ridership projections, if you assume that all riders go the entire length of the corridor and if demand tends to highly concentrated in a peak hour, ""one could get to three lanes in each direction. But that’s a lot of unlikely ifs.""

Indeed, our sources raised some questions about Biden’s explanation.

• Was Biden in his statement sufficiently clear that he meant future traffic loads? When we and several of our experts first read his comment, we assumed he meant that shifting the current train passenger loads to I-95 would require seven new lanes. But Biden’s office clarified that he was referring to both current and future loads. The statement is not phrased incorrectly, but we think it could have been made more precise.

• How reliable are the study’s assumptions about rates of growth? The Transportation Department estimated future growth using two different approaches -- projecting travel based on Census data and using travel growth estimates from state departments of transportation. But projections over several decades come with significant uncertainty, so we are taking them with a grain of salt.

• Does Biden’s calculation include traffic on regional commuter lines? In his statement, Biden said that shifting Amtrak passenger loads would cause the seven-lane increase. But commuter lines such as MARC, New Jersey Transit and SEPTA also use the corridor, and the Transportation Department confirmed that its study factored in commuter line ridership as well.

Commuter lines are far from a trivial factor. Commuter rail trips in the corridor actually exceed Amtrak’s by roughly a 20-to-1 margin, although the two are similar in terms of total miles traveled, since commuter trips are typically shorter than Amtrak jaunts.

We think most people would assume that Biden’s reference to shutting down ""Amtrak's Northeast Corridor"" referred only to Amtrak trains. Rail experts (like Biden) may know that closing down one system likely means closing down the other, but we don’t think the average listener would. So we think Biden erred in failing to mention commuter lines alongside Amtrak in his speech.

• Does Biden’s calculation assume that all the rail traffic will shift to I-95? Some of the longer-distance traffic is likely to shift to airplanes -- a factor the Transportation Department confirmed did not play into its study. The problem is that the ""real impact"" of shutting down the Northeast Corridor could be felt in the already-congested airports in and around New York, said Robert Puentes, a transportation scholar at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution.

We should note that Biden did mention the potential impact on airports in a subsequent portion of his Philadelphia speech. But factoring air travel into the statistics about adding lanes would almost certainly have changed the mathematics.

• Does Biden’s calculation take into consideration how people actually ride the Northeast Corridor? Say 10,000 riders travel from from Boston to New York, another 10,000 riders travel from New York to Philadelphia and 10,000 riders travel from Philadelphia to Washington. These would be counted as 30,000 riders, and their miles traveled would be lumped together. However, the the impact of switching them to I-95 would only add 10,000 lane trips, not 30,000.

So where does this leave us? Biden based his comment on a professionally done, federally sponsored study. However, experts note methodological shortcomings, notably that the study does not factor in air travel, and they offer alternative models that suggest less drastic shifts than seven-lane increases.

In addition, Biden compounded these uncertainties by his framing of the study. We don’t think the average person would have assumed he was talking about shutting down commuter rail systems as well as Amtrak. On balance, we rate his statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/11/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-closing-northeast-corridor-would-fo/

Richmond Mayor Dwight Jones says city has $981 million in active development projects
","
It was highly symbolic that Richmond Mayor Dwight Jones chose the newly renovated Hippodrome Theater as the site of his State of the City Address on Feb. 3.

The city’s economic development successes were a key part of his speech. The theater is emblematic of the triumphs. It opened in 1914 and hosted legendary acts such as Ray Charles, Ella Fitzgerald and Richmond native Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson. After years of decay, developers are turning the theater into a music hall. The project also includes apartments, retail space and restaurants, one of which is already open.

Jones said it was ""fitting"" he was speaking in a ""venue which has sat empty for most of the last 40 years.""

The mayor then boasted that there are ""$981 million, almost a billion dollars, in active development projects right here in the City of Richmond.""

Our daily commutes take us past many of the works and we wanted to find out if all those cranes really comprise $981 million in ""active"" projects.

Tammy Hawley, the mayor’s press secretary, sent us a project list that added up to $981.7 million in public and private investments. But she added some fine print. While Jones said the ventures were ""active,"" Hawley said the figure is actually based on projects ""we know about that are either recently completed, under construction or in the pipeline.""

The 28 listed projects range in value from $3 million to $158 million. Many of the largest public investments are improvements at Virginia Commonwealth University’s Monroe Park campus and at the Medical College of Virginia, its hospital campus.

The biggest project is a new school of medicine at VCU. The city’s development office says that project will cost $158 million.

The next-largest project, by dollar value, is the building of a new wing at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, which the city says cost $150 million.

Residents of the city’s Museum District, where the VMFA is located, are hardly troubled by construction noise and dust, however. That’s because the new wing opened on May 1, 2010.

The list of projects includes the $64.8 million Williams Mullen building on 10th Street in downtown. But the law firm opened for business at its new location on June 14, 2010, nearly nine months before the mayor’s speech.

Also listed  are a $10 million expansion of the Virginia War Memorial and the $10.1 million refurbishment of the city’s Manchester Courthouse. Both projects are completed.

And the city identifies two Jackson Ward apartment complexes--one targeted at VCU students and the other at the over-55 crowd. Both are completed and open to tenants.

We counted $249.4 million in completed ventures that are on the city’s list of ""active development projects."" Cross them out and the value of active projects is actually $732.3 million. That’s a 25.4 percent difference from the mayor’s figure.

Then there’s the case of Crosland LLC’s proposed ""Manchester on the James"" project for 200 apartments and parking at the southern end of the Lee Bridge. The city says it will cost $26.6 million.

The City Council approved the project in June 2008, stipulating the company must get a building permit within two years and begin construction no more than six months after that. The General Assembly has passed a law allowing a grace period for projects delayed because of the recent recession, so the project will not need further approvals before construction begins.

No building permit has been issued for that site since 2008, when a demolition permit was issued. The demolition permit expired in October 2009. 
Let’s review our findings.

Jones said in his speech that Richmond has ""$981 million in active development projects."" His spokeswoman, when contacted a few days later, clarified that the number includes recently completed projects, sites where work is currently ongoing, and planned projects.

When completed works are excluded, the number of current or planned development deals falls to $732.3 million, 25.4 percent less than what the mayor cited. And another project, the $26.6 million Manchester on the James, is dormant.

No doubt, Richmond has been developing in recent years and several major projects were successfully completed in 2010. But the mayor’s number is not right; it paints a better picture than what exists. Therefore we rate the Jones’ claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/11/dwight-jones/richmond-mayor-dwight-jones-says-city-has-981-mill/
"['Candidate Biography', 'County Budget', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Jeff Stone']","
Milwaukee County executive candidate Jeff Stone says he’s the only candidate who has voted against increasing government pensions
","
For a scandal that destroyed the political careers of several top Milwaukee County politicians, the 2002 pension deal seems a surprising afterthought in the 2011 county executive campaign.

Have voters forgotten about the whole mess overseen by F. Thomas Ament, who was driven from the county executive’s office by irate voters?

State Rep. Jeff Stone (R-Greendale) hopes not.

He utters the P-word in a radio ad that debuted Feb. 7, 2011. The ad doesn’t mention the Ament scandal directly, but that’s clearly the background for the statement.

""I’m the only candidate for Milwaukee County executive,"" Stone says in the spot, ""that has voted against increasing government pensions.""

Is Stone right about his record and that of the four other candidates in the race?

The five are hoping to replace Scott Walker, who was elected governor in November 2010. The primary election is Feb. 15, 2011.

Let’s start with Stone.

Stone’s ad can’t be talking about the county pension enhancements. He is a former Greenfield alderman and a current state lawmaker. He’s never served on the County Board.

His campaign told us he referred to a 1999 vote in the Legislature on pension sweeteners for nearly 350,000 public employees covered by the Wisconsin Retirement System.

That deal, which estimates at the time said boosted pensions by an average of 10 percent, covered most state and local government workers in Wisconsin, excluding Milwaukee city and county workers who are part of separate pension systems.

Stone did vote against the 1999 state pension package.  

He joined 18 other Republicans (including Walker), and one Democrat, in voting against the enhancements, which passed the Assembly with bipartisan support, 79-20.

Stone told us the sweeteners were too costly and state pensions already were generous enough. However, he has not attempted to waive the benefits for himself; he says the process for doing so is unclear and complicated.

Stone’s radio ad  touched on all the candidates, though, not just his vote.

To our ears, it can be heard two ways.

One: A subtle suggestion that his opponents have cast votes in favor of pension hikes or otherwise favor bigger pensions. Two: Simply underscoring that only Stone faced a tough decision and came down against pension enhancements.

He told us he meant the latter.

""It’s what separates me,"" Stone said. ""It implies they never had the responsibility of making those kinds of decisions"" or voted in favor of increases.

One of Stone’s rivals, County Board Chairman Lee Holloway, did face a similar decision. Holloway was a member of the County Board when the sweeping, Ament-sponsored pension deal came before supervisors in 2000 and 2001.

Holloway voted to approve the Ament deal, which passed easily. In the midst of the scandal, he  survived a recall election. He later waived any personal gain from the benefits.

Holloway points out that he has subsequently voted to cut various pension benefits, increase the retirement age and require employees to contribute 2 percent of their salaries into the pension fund.

As for Stone’s two other main rivals, they have not had an opportunity to vote yes or no on pension improvements.

Jim Sullivan, a former Democratic state senator, took state office years after the vote Stone cites. We could find no pension enhancement votes during Sullivan’s tenure as a public official, including time on the Wauwatosa Common Council. Sullivan could not recall any either.

Asked recently about his view of the Ament deal, Sullivan said: ""The 2002 pension deal was irresponsible and wrong. The people of Milwaukee County deserve better than bloated pensions for bureaucrats and elected officials.  As county executive, I will never allow a deal of this sort to occur.""

A footnote: Sullivan has accepted campaign donations from Ament, as the Journal Sentinel reported.

Another candidate for exec, philanthropist Chris Abele, is making his first bid for public office. So he has not had a chance to vote on anything.

Abele did, however, co-author a 2006 report on the county’s finances in the wake of the pension scandal. He acted in his role as a civic activist and donor, working on a panel set up by the Greater Milwaukee Committee.

That report  bemoaned ""a series of irresponsible pension benefit increases (that) quickly turned a modest pension surplus into a huge pension liability."" It called for changes in health care and pension benefits to help reduce the county’s massive unfunded liabilities.

The fifth candidate, paralegal Ieshuh Griffin, has not held public office before.

Let’s wrap up.

Stone claims that he alone voted against pension increases. Some may argue by making a comparison to rival candidates who have never been in a position to cast votes, he adds a slightly misleading touch to the claim. But the context of it is Stone reciting the virtues of his own resume, not attacking others for shortcomings on theirs.

Michelle Obama says many too fat to fight in military
","
America, the first lady says, has a pudgy problem.

A significant percentage of its youths are too fat to fit in military uniforms.

First lady Michelle Obama talked about the issue during her visit Wednesday to the Atlanta area to promote healthy eating. In a speech at Alpharetta’s North Point Community Church to highlight her ""Let’s Move"" healthy living campaign, Obama relayed a gaudy statistic.

""Believe it or not, right now, nearly 27 percent of 17- to 24-year-olds are too overweight to serve in our military,"" she said.

Perhaps the military needs its own ""Biggest Loser"" contest for recruits.

AJC PolitiFact Georgia had another thought. Should we believe the first lady?

Obama’s claim apparently came from a study released last year that was titled -- aptly perhaps -- ""Too Fat to Fight."" It was released by more than 100 high-ranking retired military officials and other enlisted leaders who want high-calorie food and sugar-sweetened drinks removed from the nation’s public schools.

That doesn’t include sweet tea, does it?

The report said: ""over 27 percent of all Americans 17 to 24 years of age -- over nine million young men and women -- are too heavy to join the military if they want to do so."" The estimate was based on a 2005 national survey conducted by the Lewin Group. ""The estimate uses a weight-for-height cutoff that allows somewhat higher weights than the cutoff used by civilian organizations, such as the National Institutes of Health,"" the report said.

In 2008, there were 11,472,200 Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 who were obese or overweight, the study reported, citing research by the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were 29.8 million Americans between those ages, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That equals nearly 39 percent of Americans in that age range who were obese or overweight, an even higher percentage than those found in the ""Too Fat to Fight"" study who couldn’t serve in the military.

Stay away from the cheeseburger, soldier!

Military officials say this is serious business. ""The United States military stands ready to protect the American people, but if our nation does not help ensure that future generations grow up to be healthy and fit ... the health of our children and our national security are at risk,"" the report says.

It also affects the federal budget. The military discharges about 1,200 recruits a year because they are not fit enough to serve. The military estimates it costs $50,000 to recruit and train a soldier. Add it up and that’s $60 million a year the federal government loses on enlistees too heavy to fight.

The average American man is 5 foot 9 and weighs 195 pounds, according to the CDC. The average American woman is nearly 5 foot 4 and weighs 165 pounds.

The mean height and weight for an 18-year-old man is 5 foot 9 and 166 pounds, according to the most recent data we could find. The mean height and weight and BMI for an 18-year-old woman is 5 foot 4 and 143.5 pounds. We couldn’t find data detailing the percentage of 18-year-olds who are overweight or obese. The CDC does report that 18 percent of 12- to 19-year-old Americans are obese.

So what constitutes too fat to fight? Each military branch has its own rules.

An 18-year-old, 5-foot-9 man who weighs more than 175 pounds would raise eyebrows for the Army, according to Military.com. The Army would be similarly concerned about a 5-foot-4, 18-year-old woman who weighs more than 133 pounds. For 40-year-old women that height, the Army would be worried if they weighed more than 145 pounds.

The Air Force and Navy are a little easier on their enlistees. The Navy considers a 5-foot-9 man greater than 186 pounds overweight, and its maximum standard weight for a 5-foot-4 woman is 156 pounds. The Air Force says the maximum weight for a 5-foot-9 recruit is 186 pounds.

A New York Times article in August highlighted the problem. One U.S. Army general said 4 percent of male recruits at one training center in 2000 failed the most basic fitness. By 2006, more than 20 percent of male recruits failed the same test. The percentages were higher for women.

PolitiFact Georgia has tackled such weighty issues before. Before Thanksgiving, the American holiday of gastronomical gluttony, we checked a claim that Georgia has the second-highest rate of childhood obesity in the nation. Our finding? True.

According to the CDC figures, the mean American 18-year-old is close to being considered overweight but would still be accepted in the military in most cases. But about one in five of them is considered obese, the CDC says, and would be at least 15 to 20 pounds too heavy to fight.

Based on the CDC study, we believe it’s reasonable to think that at least an additional 7 percent of America’s remaining 17- to 24-year-olds would have trouble meeting the military’s weight guidelines. The ""Too Fat to Fight"" study supports the theory that 27 percent of America’s youths couldn’t serve in the military.

Rep. Jay Hottinger says Ohio's threshold for taxing estates is the nation's lowest
","
The new Republican majority in the Ohio House of Representatives has made repealing the state's estate tax a priority.

Opponents of the tax say it hurts Ohio's competitive position with other states, and drives away residents and business.

Among its staunchest supporters are cities and towns. They received about $270 million of nearly $334 million that the tax generated in fiscal 2009, according to the Ohio Department of Taxation. The rest went to the state.

PolitiFact Ohio is not looking at the debate on merits of the estate tax. But we did decide to check a couple of basic claims made by State Rep. Jay Hottinger, a leading estate tax opponent, on the  ""Sound of Ideas"" on WCPN 90.3 FM.

The Newark Republican said Ohio is one of only 17 states with an estate tax. And, he said, Ohio has ""the lowest threshold in the nation"" for taxable estates, making it a tax that affects the middle class as well as the wealthy.

We found Hottinger's count of states is accurate, or as close as anyone is likely to get. State tax laws change frequently, if not constantly, and at least six states dropped or reinstated an estate tax -- or did both -- in the past six months alone.

Ohio does have the lowest threshold among them. The state's tax is levied on estates valued above $338,333 (although there is a 100 percent exemption for surviving spouses). Data from the Ohio Department of Taxation shows that one in 14 estates (about 7 percent) in Ohio are subject to the tax, the Associated Press reported. More than 7,400 estates owed the state money in the fiscal year that ended in mid-June.

Among the other states, the thresholds ranged from a low of $675,000 in New Jersey to a $5 million threshold in North Carolina.

Looking at those levels made us wonder about a related claim we've heard from both opponents and supporters of the estate tax -- that Ohio's threshold is low because it is outdated, reflecting an earlier generation's measure of wealth.

We checked the history and  talked with an analyst at the Department of Taxation, and learned that the current rate of taxation and the $338,333 deduction were set by the General Assembly in 2000.

The previous threshold was $25,000. It was set after the state's 75-year-old inheritance tax was repealed and the estate tax was adopted in 1968.

Twenty-five thousand dollars meant more in 1968 than it does today, but it didn’t equal wealth,  and adjusted for inflation, it wouldn’t equal $338,333.  According to the consumer price calculator of the Federal Reserve Bank, its 2011 equivalent would be $158,601.

Hottinger, a sponsor of pending legislation to repeal the tax, has described it as ""the most unfair and most egregious tax in the state of Ohio."" We’re not running that statement through the Truth-O-Meter.

But we do rate his claims about the number of states that levy the tax and Ohio’s low threshold as True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/11/jay-hottinger/rep-jay-hottinger-says-ohios-threshold-taxing-esta/

Obama says companies have nearly $2 trillion sitting on their balance sheets
","
In an address to the Chamber of Commerce in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 7, 2011, President Barack Obama implored business owners to start investing and hiring. And, he said, they've got plenty of cash on hand to do it.

""So if I’ve got one message, my message is now is the time to invest in America,"" Obama said. ""...Today, American companies have nearly $2 trillion sitting on their balance sheets. And I know that many of you have told me that you’re waiting for demand to rise before you get off the sidelines and expand, and that with millions of Americans out of work, demand has risen more slowly than any of us would like.

""We’re in this together, but many of your own economists and salespeople are now forecasting a healthy increase in demand,"" Obama said. ""So I just want to encourage you to get in the game.""

We're checking Obama's claim that ""American companies have nearly $2 trillion sitting on their balance sheets.""

We asked the White House press office where Obama got the statistic, and they pointed us to a Dec. 10, 2010, story in the Wall Street Journal, which ran under the headline, ""Companies Cling to Cash.""

""Corporate America's cash pile has hit its highest level in half a century,"" wrote Justin Lahart.

""Rather than pouring their money into building plants or hiring workers, nonfinancial companies in the U.S. were sitting on $1.93 trillion in cash and other liquid assets at the end of September, up from $1.8 trillion at the end of June, the Federal Reserve said Thursday. Cash accounted for 7.4 percent of the companies' total assets — the largest share since 1959.

""The cash buildup shows the deep caution many companies feel about investing in expansion while the economic recovery remains painfully slow, and high unemployment and battered household finances continue to limit consumers' ability to spend.""

The Wall Street Journal got its numbers from a Federal Reserve ""flow of funds"" report issued on Dec. 9, 2010.

The figures come from a section on ""Nonfarm Nonfinancial Corporate Business"" (Table L. 102); specifically, Line 41, ""total liquid assets."" In the third quarter of 2010, the liquid assets came to $1.93 trillion, up from about $1.5 trillion in 2005 and 2006. You can check out the footnotes for a detailed explanation of what all is considered a liquid asset, but it includes cash and money market and mutual fund shares.

As always, there are lots of ways to slice the data.

As a result, Satya Thallam, director of the Financial Markets Working Group at George Mason University's conservative Mercatus Center, cautioned not to place too much stock in the absolute precision of Obama's number.

""If you break out financial assets by category, into say liquid and less liquid assets, you can pretty much create any number you want, because '$2 trillion sitting on their balance sheets' is imprecise,"" Thallam said. ""For instance, if you use checkable deposits, time and savings deposits and money market funds for both categories of business, you get $2.3 trillion.""

We spoke to two other economists who preferred to cite a different category of businesses, ""Nonfinancial Business"" (Table L. 101) instead of ""Nonfarm Nonfinancial Corporate Business"" used by the Wall Street Journal. In the third quarter of 2010, the liquid assets for nonfinancial businesses was $2.4 trillion; up from just over $1.9 trillion in 2005.

Although experts may differ on which category to highlight, it was perfectly reasonable for the Wall Street Journal to cite the category it did.

More important, though, is that Obama's statement implies companies are sitting on a full $2 trillion that could be immediately invested in business expansion. And that's not right.

""Much of this money is already committed -- it must be used to pay wages, suppliers, rent, utilities, etc.,"" said Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""But, there is little doubt that companies have a great deal of cash sitting around that they could use to invest, if they wanted, even if $2 trillion is more than a bit of an exaggeration.""

It's crucial, said Brian Bethune, an economist at IHS Global Insight, to ""normalize"" the figure. In other words, how much in liquid assets did businesses have on hand back when things were going relatively well?

In the category Obama cited, liquid assets came to about $1.5 trillion in 2005 and 2006. That's a good indicator of normal levels, Bethune said.

Obama's statement suggests companies have about $2 trillion in cash they aren't using, he said, ""and that's not really the way to look at it.""

""Companies have to have a certain amount of working cash to meet payroll and other business expenses,"" Bethune said. ""By some measure, that's excess cash. But that's a major distortion. It's not like all of a sudden there is free cash sitting around.""

Still, no matter how you slice the data, the Federal Reserve statistics show that companies are holding on to much more cash and liquid assets than they have in years past, so Obama's broader point is valid. It was also presented in general enough terms -- ""$2 trillion sitting on their balance sheets"" -- that it is defensible as an accurate figure. But to the extent Obama's statement implies companies could readily invest that entire amount of money, it is misleading. Less the amount needed to meet regular business expenses, the amount on the balance sheet that could be used to invest in business expansion (including hiring new workers) is actually much smaller. And so we knock Obama's statement down a notch to Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/10/barack-obama/obama-says-companies-have-nearly-2-trillion-sittin/
"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott's budget includes some big tax cuts, but not all for you
","
One of the best ways to show voters the impact of tax cuts is to break them down in a way people can appreciate.

Take Gov. Rick Scott's budget roll-out the week of Feb. 7, 2011. Scott says his spending plan includes $4.1 billion in tax and fee relief over two years. That sounds good, but it means little to someone unfamiliar with the inner workings of the state budget.

So Scott's budget team decided to boil that figure down to show the impact on Florida households.

In a graphic showing the proposed tax relief for 2011-2013, Scott's budget gurus added this simple-to-digest sound bite: ""Total Savings Per Household, $540 Over Two Years."" The figure got repeated by various media outlets.

So we wondered, is it right?

No doubt about it, Scott's budget proposal includes a variety of tax and fee reductions. Among them:

• Reduce the corporate income tax from 5.5 percent to 3 percent in 2011-2012 and from 3 percent to 2.5 percent in 2012-2013. The rate cut will save those who pay the tax $459 million this year and a little more than $1 billion in 2012-2013.

• Reduce the required local effort, a property tax to fund schools, saving taxpayers around $600 million in 2011-2012. The tax cut would carry forward in 2012-2013.

• Reduce the property tax collected by state water management districts 25 percent for two years, saving taxpayers $180 million annually.

• Reduce unemployment compensation taxes by shortening how long Floridians can collect benefits and making it more difficult for them to be eligible. Scott's office says that will save $630.8 million over two years.

• Roll back 2009 Legislature-approved fee increases for driver licenses, vehicle registrations and other motor vehicle fees. Scott says the rollback would save drivers $492 million over two years.

• Repeal or alter other small taxes on ammonia, pesticides, fertilizer, solvents, dry cleaning, tires and lead acid batteries, among other things. The changes would save $77 million over two years, Scott's office says.

Taken together, Scott's says the savings for taxpayers is $4.1 billion over two years. (For the record, we question that overall figure because most cuts in the second year of Scott's budget aren't additional cuts; they are just the same cuts rolled over.)

But what's critical in determining a per-household savings is remembering just who will get the tax breaks. And, who won't.

Two of the three biggest tax cuts -- the reduction of the corporate income tax and the changes to the unemployment compensation tax -- apply only to corporations. So unless your household is like Rick Scott's and you own a corporation, you'll see no direct savings under Scott's plans. Supporters of the cuts argue that the benefits could trickle down to average Floridians through additional jobs or cheaper prices for goods and services. But there's no guarantee either will happen.

The cuts to the corporate income tax and the unemployment compensation tax make up $2.1 billion of Scott's overall $4.1 billion impact.

In comments to the Senate Budget Committee on Feb. 9, 2011, Scott budget chief Jerry McDaniel said Scott's top tax priority was to remove taxes that he says inhibit job creation. McDaniel said Scott particularly wanted to reduce and eventually eliminate the state's corporate income tax.

We asked McDaniel after the  Feb. 9 meeting if he knew whether the per-household figure accounted for the corporate tax cuts. McDaniel said he did not know and suggested we e-mail the governor's press office seeking clarification. We did, but did not hear back.

So we did the math ourselves.

According to the U.S. Census, Florida had 6,337,929 households in 2000 (the last year that precise data is available). However, the state's Demographic Estimating Conference meets annually to project the number of Florida households, among other things. At their most recent meeting on Oct. 25, 2010, the group estimated that as of Jan. 1, 2011, Florida would have roughly 7.5 million households. The group's estimates are based on the active number of residential electric customers and residential building permits.

Using the most recent household estimate, it's easy to see the error in Scott's tax cut math.

Not counting the cuts to the corporate income tax and the unemployment compensation tax, the average household would see in the neighborhood of $267 in tax savings over two years, not $540. ($2 billion / 7.5 million = $267 per household). That's an annual savings of around $134, or less than half of what Scott suggested.

The $540-per-household figure Scott used to sell his budget plan is intended to appeal to voters who would relish a hefty tax cut, even over two years. But he failed to factor in that more than half of those tax cuts would apply only to employers, not regular Floridians. In calculating the savings, it appears clear that Scott and his office simply divided the entire tax cut as projected by Scott -- $4.1 billion -- by the entire number of Florida households -- 7.5 million -- to reach their average savings of $540. That's easy math. But it's deceptive.

Milwaukee County executive candidate Jim Sullivan says police have to wait for hours with mental health patients
","
During a two-month period in 2004, more than 60 people with mental health emergencies waited for up to 60 hours to get treatment at the Milwaukee County Mental Health Complex. Some had to be kept under police guard until they could receive care.

In early 2008, police agencies continued to rack up thousands of dollars in overtime as officers waited in their squad cars or in hospital emergency rooms with patients who needed psychiatric crisis services.

According to Jim Sullivan, one of the five candidates running in the Feb. 15, 2011, primary election for Milwaukee County executive, the problem persists.

In a Jan. 31, 2011 meeting with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editors and reporters, Sullivan responded to a question about the Mental Health Complex by saying:

""When they’re full up over there, our local police officers -- if you’ve got somebody who needs to be over at mental health because they’re mentally ill, they may pose a danger to themselves, any of these different things -- if it’s full, cops sit out there in their squad cars with a mentally ill patient in the back and they have to wait to unload and people will, in some cases, spend an entire shift out there doing that.""

If Sullivan is right, police officers are regularly experiencing hours-long delays at the Mental Health Complex when transporting someone who needs crisis services.

Is he right?

We asked Sullivan, a former Democratic state senator from Wauwatosa, the basis for his statement. He did not have any direct evidence, but said he heard the Wauwatosa and West Allis police departments experienced such waits.

Thousands of people each year receive crisis care at the complex, 9455 W. Watertown Plank Road. Some are admitted to the 96-bed facility but most are treated and released.

As Sullivan indicated, crisis patients are brought to the facility, often by police, because they are deemed a danger to themselves or others.

The Journal Sentinel’s Patients in Peril investigation has uncovered numerous problems at the complex, from bungled care of patients and staff members falsifying documents to skyrocketing overtime costs.

But delays faced by police officers transporting crisis patients have not been in the news recently.

What’s more, Sullivan’s claim about delays is contradicted by an October 2010 study by a national consulting firm, which found that changes made by the county ""have been very effective in reducing backups.""

The finding was reiterated by the Milwaukee-based Public Policy Forum research organization in a January 2011 report, which summarized issues for candidates in the county executive race.

That report relied, in part, on a November 2010 county memo that showed a dramatic reduction in police waits beginning in 2008.

To further check Sullivan’s statement, we contacted the two police departments he cited as well as the Milwaukee Police Department and the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office.

Here is what they told us:

Wauwatosa police: Long delays ended five or more years ago and current wait times are usually less than 30 minutes, said Capt. Jeff Sutter. ""It would be extremely unusual for us to have what I consider a long wait,"" he said.

West Allis police: Long waits ended three years ago, according to Chief Mike Jungbluth, who said his officers transport patients to the Mental Health Complex ""every day.""

Milwaukee police: ""We aren’t experiencing the issue anymore,"" said spokeswoman Anne E. Schwartz.

Milwaukee County sheriff:  Deputies usually wait about 20 minutes, said Capt. Darlene Jonas. If several officers are trying to get patients treated, the wait time could be one to two hours, she said.

So what’s the bottom line?

Sullivan said delays in admitting people to the Mental Health Complex for crisis care can be so long that police officers spend up to an entire shift with patients waiting for them to receive treatment. Hours-long delays were a problem some years ago. But the four largest police agencies in the county now say waits are short.   

Perhaps there are isolated cases today in which officers waits for hours, but at minimum Sullivan’s claim is clearly dated.

Tom DeLay says foreman of the jury that convicted him was a Greenpeace activist
","
Tom DeLay, the Republican former U.S. House majority leader convicted in Austin of laundering corporate contributions to bolster Texas House candidates, insisted he did no wrong and that the the case against him was just politics.

In a Jan. 13 interview, DeLay told Matt Lauer, host of NBC-TV’s ""Today,"" that his indictment and trial was driven by liberal Democrats and that the ""foreman of the jury was a Greenpeace activist."" Greenpeace is an international group that calls itself the leading independent ""campaigning organization that uses peaceful direct action and creative communication"" to expose and promote solutions to global environmental problems.

""The point is is that this is a political campaign"" against me, DeLay said.

Greenpeace v. DeLay? We wanted background.

An online search of news coverage showed that The Houston Chronicle identified the jury foreman in a Nov. 23 news article saying in part that the ""forewoman"" is a Greenpeace activist named Katie Stotts. The article’s author, R.G. Ratcliffe, told us in an interview that courtroom observers learned Stotts’ name when the judge inadvertently said it aloud. Ratcliffe said the Greenpeace information came from an entry on Stotts’ Facebook page indicating that she’d enthusiastically answered an invitation to a Greenpeace event. In our own Facebook check, we found that someone identified as Katarina von Stottsen said ""HELL YES"" to attending a September 2009 Greenpeace party in Austin.

After DeLay’s trial, a letter from Katie Stotts of Austin appeared Nov. 30 on the Austin American-Statesman’s editorial page. In the letter, Stotts says that she was a juror in the trial, adding: ""We did have a good mix of political affiliations on the jury, but what it came down to wasn't political sides. It took us three very difficult and intense days to come to a decision because we were considering all of the evidence to ensure that we came to the right decision.""

Stotts’ letter continues: ""For those out there crying ‘liberal,’ they don't have a leg to stand on. It is an insult to my fellow jurors and I who put our lives on hold, and poured every last bit of our energy into making certain that a fair outcome was reached based only on the evidence, not any sort of political agenda... We performed our civil service with honesty and integrity, and stereotypes have no place in that.""

The letter makes no mention of Greenpeace.

DeLay’s daughter, Dani DeLay Garcia, who sometimes serves as his spokeswoman, told us by e-mail that the foreman ""wrote that she was a Greenpeace activist on her questionnaire,"" referring to written questions answered by prospective jurors before jury selection.

Garcia also said she’s been told the questionnaires are public record.

Not so, advised Michelle Brinkman, chief deputy clerk for the Travis County District Clerk’s office. She noted that the state’s Code of Criminal Procedure says information about a person collected by a court during jury selection is confidential and may not be disclosed unless a party to the trial or bona fide member of the news media applies for it. Then, ""on a showing of good cause, the court shall permit disclosure,"" the law says.

At our request, Brinkman asked the judge who presided over DeLay’s trial if questionnaire responses were available. The judge, Pat Priest, replied to her by e-mail Jan. 31: ""I don't think we need dance either to Mr. DeLay's tune or to  the reporter's, and the jurors made it clear they want their privacy protected. Tell him the information is unavailable.""

The same day, we reached Dick DeGuerin, DeLay’s lawyer in the case. DeGuerin declined to share a copy of Stotts’ questionnaire responses. But, he said, Stotts partly answered a question about club memberships including political involvements by writing: ""I am a paying member of Greenpeace."" DeGuerin said she answered the next question, per volunteer activities, with: ""I’ve been to multiple rallies for environmental preservation issues."" 
In a follow-up interview, DeGuerin said he did not use any allotted pre-emptory challenges to strike Stotts from the jury. ""There were others"" in the jury pool ""much more objectionable,"" DeGuerin said. ""I wish I’d had 20 strikes."" 
Finally, we reached an Austin-area Greenpeace leader, who referred us to the group’s Washington spokesman, Joe Smyth. Smyth had no comment about Stotts but said via e-mail: ""Every citizen enjoys the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, including serving on a jury, so it's bizarre that Tom Delay seems to think he can blame his criminal conviction on someone's politics or membership in an organization.""

Upshot: While Stotts reportedly self-identified as a Greenpeace backer, we’d need more information to deem her a Greenpeace activist. We rate DeLay’s statement Mostly True. 
UPDATE, 10:30 a.m. Feb. 11, 2011: After we published this article, Stotts responded to our Jan. 31 e-mail seeking comment. Stotts replied Feb. 10: ""I contribute monetarily to Greenpeace, but I am not a Greenpeace activist. I went to, at most, a few local environmental rallies because a good friend of mine used to work for their organization. I have probably volunteered more times for the food bank in Austin than I have for official Greenpeace events. I also work for a conservative insurance company, but neither of these things had an effect on my ability to render an honest and fair verdict in the trial.""",/factchecks/2011/feb/10/tom-delay/tom-delay-says-foreman-jury-convicted-him-was-gree/

National Organization for Marriage says Massachusetts public schools teach kindergartners about gay marriage
","
In early January, just days after Lincoln Chafee replaced Donald Carcieri as governor of Rhode Island, advocates on both sides of the same-sex marriage debate ramped up their annual battle.

This year, the fight is taking on new intensity because, while Carcieri vowed for eight years to veto any bill to legalize gay marriage, Chafee supports it.

Recently, a leading opponent, the National Organization for Marriage, mailed brochures throughout the state that included the headline: ""Imposing same-sex marriage has consequences."" The brochure listed four ""real consequences"" of ""redefining marriage to a genderless institution.""

We chose to examine one of the claims: ""Massachusetts’ public schools teach kids as young as kindergartners about gay marriage. Parents have no legal right to object!""

We contacted Christopher C. Plante, executive director of the Rhode Island chapter of NOM, who told us that many schools in Massachusetts -- where same-sex marriage has been legal since 2004 -- have books on the subject in their libraries.The ""poster child,"" he said, is a picture book called  ""King & King,""  by Linda de Haan and Stern Nijland.

The book tells the story of a queen who decided it was time for her son, the prince, to marry. He rejects every princess she offers. Finally the last candidate enters, and the prince feels ""a stir in his heart."" But it was for the princess’s brother, Prince Lee.

The two marry, and the book says ""everyone lives happily ever after."" On the last page, the two princes kiss, with a red heart covering their mouths.

The book ""glorifies the idea that it’s perfectly OK to have same-sex marriage,"" said Plante. And he said the courts have ruled that the educational system has a duty to ""normalize"" same-sex marriage for grades as low as kindergarten.

Asked for examples of where the book is taught to kindergartners, Plante offered just one location, Lexington, Mass., where it became an issue in 2006.  

That year, two couples -- David and Tonia Parker and Robert and Robin Wirthlin -- filed a federal lawsuit against Lexington school officials. The suit alleged that the Parkers’ son was given a book in kindergarten that depicts various forms of families, including one with parents of the same gender. And, the suit said, when the Wirthlins’ son was in first grade, he was read another book,  ""King & King,"" in school.

The parents said they have religious beliefs that homosexuality is immoral and that marriage is  a holy union only of a man and a woman. They alleged school officials were attempting to indoctrinate their children with the belief that same sex marriages are moral.

In 2007, The U.S. District Court in Massachusetts dismissed the parents’ claims, finding that parents don’t have the right to restrict what a public school may teach their children, even if the teachings contradict the parents’ religious beliefs.

The parents appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit but lost. The appeals court wrote: ""There is no allegation here of a formalized curriculum requiring students to read many books affirming gay marriage. The reading by a teacher of one book, or even three, and even if to a young and impressionable child, does not constitute ""indoctrination.""

Asked for any other examples of gay marriage being taught to kindergartners, Plante referred us to Kris Mineau, executive director of the Massachusetts Family Institute, which describes itself as ""dedicated to strengthening the family and affirming the Judeo-Christian values upon which it is based.""

Mineau said he has been fighting same-sex marriage advocates for eight years and he is certain their message is being spread in schools throughout Massachusetts.

But he acknowledged he could not cite any examples other than Lexington. ""I don’t have documentation of everything going on,"" Mineau said. ""It’s very difficult to quantify.""

Mineau also said the 2007 court rulings discouraged other parents from officially complaining about their children being exposed to school programs endorsing same-sex marriage.

We looked for other evidence that Massachusetts schools are teaching kindergartners about same-sex marriage.

We asked Jonathan Considine, spokesman for the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, if the state mandated curriculum on same-sex marriage for kindergartners. The answer is no, he said. Massachusetts is a local control state, so each district decides on what topics to cover.

He said, ""Massachusetts does not require that students in any grade be taught about gay marriage.""

He said many schools have used books or promoted discussions to teach tolerance because some students have same-sex parents and there are teachers with same-sex spouses.

Considine referred us to The Massachusetts Comprehensive Health Curriculum, which includes a standard that by fifth grade, students should be able to define sexual orientation, such as heterosexual, gay and lesbian. It makes no recommendations about teaching different types of marriages to kindergartners.

Then we called the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which represents 107,000 educators.

Laura Bennett, a spokeswoman for the association, said she does not know whether anyone is discussing same-sex marriages with kindergartners in any of the state’s hundreds of school districts.  But she is relatively certain no one else has publicly complained.

""I work on communications with teachers, and if there were other cases, I would have heard,"" she said. ""There’s just that one case, over and over again.""

""I haven’t heard boo about this,"" added Thomas Gosnell, president of the American Federation of Teachers Massachusetts, which represents most of the other educators in the state. ""I have not heard one of my members tell me they are talking about gay marriage in kindergarten. They are probably not talking about any kind of marriage in that grade.

""I don’t even hear anyone talking about gay marriage anymore,"" he added. ""It’s just there.""

Bottom line: The National Organization for Marriage mailing says that Massachusetts public schools teach kindergartners about gay marriage. The wording, including the present tense verb, gives the impression this is happening now, in many schools.

But the group’s only evidence is two incidents five years ago. It’s possible that somewhere, in one of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts, other kindergartners have been taught about same-sex marriage. But NOM couldn’t cite any other examples. We find its statement False.",/factchecks/2011/feb/10/national-organization-marriage/national-organization-marriage-says-massachusetts-/

Rachel Maddow says Fox News 'said the New Black Panther Party decided the election for Barack Obama'
","In an interview on the Late Show with David Letterman, Rachel Maddow said there's a big difference in the approaches of MSNBC and Fox: MSNBC, the network that carries her nightly show, is concerned with accuracy. Fox is not.

""I of course think that we (MSNBC) are much more true than Fox is true,"" Maddow said in the Dec. 15, 2010, interview. ""The problem that I think is reasonable to assert about Fox and its coverage is that they make up stories out of whole cloth and then make a big deal out of them.""

She continued, ""For example, they said the New Black Panther Party decided the election for Barack Obama. They ran dozens and dozens and dozens of stories about the New Black Panther Party, which was one guy who braided his beard in Philadelphia and who didn’t have an organization, yelling on a street corner. They represented that story as if that is the guy who decided the election. That was fake.""

A few weeks after that appearance, a PolitiFact reader wrote us to ask if we could fact-check Maddow’s statement that Fox News ""said the New Black Panther Party decided the election for Barack Obama."" So we will.

First, some background on the controversy Maddow referenced. We addressed it in some detail in a previous item, but here’s a summary:

In mid 2010, Fox News pundits hammered the Obama administration for its handling of a voter intimidation case involving the New Black Panther Party (which is not related to the original Black Panthers), specifically, that the Obama administration backed off the case because it is afraid of prosecuting minorities for civil rights violations.

At issue was an incident on Nov. 4, 2008 -- the day of the presidential election -- when New Black Panther Party members Jerry Jackson and King Samir Shabazz stood outside a Philadelphia polling place dressed in black military-style uniforms. Shabazz held a nightstick, and the two men were accused of making intimidating remarks to both white and black voters. (You can see it on YouTube here.)
   
On Jan. 7, 2009, two weeks before Obama took office, the Department of Justice filed a civil action accusing the two men, as well as the New Black Panther Party and its leader Malik Zulu Shabazz, of engaging in voter intimidation. Although none of the defendants responded to the complaint, the department later dropped its case against all but King Samir Shabazz, the one with the nightstick. The department asked for, and got, an injunction prohibiting Shabazz from displaying a weapon within 100 feet of a Philadelphia polling location until 2012.

Many Fox News commentators criticized the government's position as outrageously lenient and saw it as evidence of an Obama administration double-standard on race issues.

But Maddow’s comment to Letterman framed Fox’s coverage of the issue in political, rather than legal, terms. Was she correct that Fox News had claimed that ""the New Black Panther Party decided the election for Barack Obama""?

We looked at dozens of Fox transcripts between June 30, 2010, and July 14, 2010, because those dates coincide with the span of coverage that Media Matters for America, a liberal group that tracks media coverage, analyzed in a blog post on July 16, 2010. Maddow referenced the Media Matters post in her blog’s item on the Letterman appearance, so we thought it would be appropriate to use that study’s parameters as the basis for checking her statement on the Late Show.

When we contacted Jess Levin, a spokeswoman for Media Matters, she told us that her group had chosen that time frame because Fox News’ coverage of the controversy during that period had been especially extensive.

The transcripts showed that indeed there was lots of coverage on Fox. However, the discussions focused on the legal side of the story and the question of whether other media outlets were derelict in not giving it enough attention.

Here are some examples of Fox News’ coverage:

• On June 30, Fox anchor Megyn Kelly appeared on Hannity to talk about the Justice Department’s dismissal of the case.

""The law says that's voter intimidation -- that if you intimidate voters from not going in the polling station or you attempt to intimidate voters. And there was testimony by one person who was trying to vote that the one guy held up his arms and physically blocked him from going that the polling station. Now, I mean, you tell me: is that or is that not voter intimidation?""

• On July 9, Fox covered a statement by the New Black Panther Party attacking Fox host Glenn Beck. Beck appeared on the O’Reilly Factor to discuss the matter. ""I wonder if anyone on any other network would talk about his hate speech or talk about his inciting violence or talk about the fact that the New Black Panther Party is a -- is a hate group.""

• On July 12, Fox host Bill O’Reilly aired a segment about the ""mainstream media"" ignoring the New Black Panther Party story. In it, he said that Attorney General Eric Holder was ""getting away with this because the liberal print press and the network news (is) pretty much ignoring the story.""

• On July 14, Fox covered the NAACP passage of a resolution condemning ""racist elements"" of the tea party. In one segment, Sean Hannity claimed that there was a double standard on racism. Speaking to conservative activist and media figure Andrew Breitbart, Hannity said, ""I haven't heard any Democrats talk about the New Black Panther Party standing outside the polling place, Andrew.""

But in all the coverage we examined, we couldn't find a single case in which the discussion revolved around the political impact of the incident, including whether the New Black Panther Party had helped put the Obama campaign over the top in 2008. (Needless to say, since Obama won by more than 8 million votes, it's not like one guy with a nightstick at a single polling place swung the election.)

When we reached out to Maddow, a spokeswoman pointed us to a commentary segment she did on her MSNBC show on July 21, 2010, that provided the full context of her criticism of Fox’s New Black Panther Party coverage. Maddow argued that coverage of that story -- combined with its criticism of African American administration figures such as Van Jones and Shirley Sherrod -- amounted to a manufactured theme of ""black people are coming for you."" She suggested that it was the most recent iteration of race-baiting techniques that date to the segregation era. ""For normal news outlets,"" Maddow said, the New Black Panther case simply ""wasn’t a story"" -- and rightfully so.

That's an opinion, but it doesn't support her allegation that Fox said the New Black Panther Party ""decided the election"" for Obama.

Maddow would have been correct if she had simply said that Fox's coverage was more extensive and hyperbolic than other networks. But her claim that Fox News ""said the New Black Panther Party decided the election for Barack Obama"" is not supported by the transcripts we reviewed.

In reality, Fox’s coverage focused on legal, racial and media-related issues, rather than the electoral impact on Obama. So we find her claim False.",/factchecks/2011/feb/09/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-fox-news-said-new-black-panther/

Chain e-mail claims that Foreign Trade Zones are a Chinese communist plot
","
In recent weeks, we’ve received a number of requests from readers to check a chain e-mail about Free Trade Zones.

The full chain e-mail is too long to print, but you can read the full version here. Following is an excerpt:

""This is an urgent message! Read this and spread the word! Subject: Foreign Trade Zones. This is unbelievable at first, but you will soon realize that there are several motives for the global communists to physically weave our United States territory together with communist China. Read On! Here's what is going on!

""Each and every one of our state governors has approved and allocated a certain amount of acres of their U.S. state land to be inhabited by Chinese communists -- communists straight from China! They are to set up little towns and live here, supposedly for the purpose of producing Chinese products for sale in the U.S.A. The land the states are giving them for their little towns will be considered ""foreign territory""!!! We are told that the laws of the state (in which these Chinese communists dwell) will apply to the communist Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ). Comment: If so, why are they allowed in here!??! Isn't the whole set up unlawful???  There are 257 of these little communist towns to be built all over the United States.""

There’s a lot to check in this excerpt, and even more in the parts we didn’t reprint. To keep to a reasonable length, we will only look at one part of it -- the idea that Foreign Trade Zones allow ""land to be inhabited by Chinese communists -- communists straight from China! They are to set up little towns and live here.""

First, a little background about Foreign Trade Zones.

In the United States, foreign-trade zones, or FTZs, date to a 1934 act of Congress. FTZs are secure areas located in or near U.S. Customs ports of entry but legally considered to be outside the Customs territory for the purpose of tariff laws and Customs entry procedures. Certain types of merchandise can be imported into the zones without paying import duties or excise taxes. Once there, the merchandise can be stored, assembled, sorted, processed or otherwise manufactured. But duties are paid only when the merchandise is transferred outside the zone and into the U.S. for sale or use.

According to the federal board that oversees FTZs, the idea is to improve U.S. competitiveness by encouraging companies to maintain operations in the U.S. FTZs give foreign companies a good reason to locate here and thus use U.S. labor, services and materials. (U.S. companies, for their part, can use FTZs in many other countries around the world, with similar benefits.)

So now let’s look at some of the claims in the e-mail.

The idea that these ""little towns will be considered ‘foreign territory’"" is false. Aside from tax and tariff rules, FTZs must conform to U.S. laws, not those of the foreign country of the companies operating within them.

Meanwhile, the notion that the ""motive"" behind FTZs is to ""physically weave our United States territory together with communist China"" is ridiculous. Not only are FTZs part of U.S. territory rather than that of a foreign country, but they were signed into law a full 15 years before the Communist Party took over the Chinese government.

Most important for our fact check, it is false to say that Chinese communists ""are to set up little towns and live here, supposedly for the purpose of producing Chinese products for sale in the U.S.A.""

If you look at the act governing FTZs, it reads: ""No person shall be allowed to reside within the zone except Federal, State, or municipal officers or agents whose resident presence is deemed necessary by the Board.""

Nothing has changed that portion of the law in the nearly eight decades since. A fact sheet from the U.S. Commerce Department confirms that the ""FTZ Act prohibits residence within a zone.""

So let’s sum up. Whatever one thinks of the policy benefits of FTZs, the idea put forth by the chain e-mail -- that Foreign Trade Zones allow ""land to be inhabited by Chinese communists -- communists straight from China! They are to set up little towns and live here"" -- is wrong. FTZs are U.S. territory, and subject to U.S. laws, in every way except for certain tax and duty laws, and in any case, ""Chinese communists,"" and almost everyone else, are barred by law from residing in them. The e-mail takes a longstanding part of U.S. law and turns it into a communist plot to take over the country. We consider that ridiculous, and rate it Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2011/feb/09/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-foreign-trade-zones-are-chines/

Rep. Pete Gallego says Mexicans have one national ID in lieu of a birth certificate and voter card
","State Rep. Leo Berman, R-Tyler, who favors a GOP-backed mandate that voters show their photo ID at the polls, recently pointed to another voter ID — in Mexico. ""If you don’t have this card in Mexico, you don’t vote,"" he said on the Jan. 27 edition of Your News Now’s Capital Tonight, holding a voter card from Mexico’s Federal Electoral Institute that he described as including a photo, fingerprint and ""your life’s history."" In a separate interview for that night’s program, which airs weekly in Austin, Waco and other cities, state Rep. Pete Gallego, D-Alpine, who opposes voter ID legislation, said: ""You’ve got to tell the whole story. In Mexico, they don’t have birth certificates, for example. They don’t have a lot of the same things that we have. They don’t have registration cards for voters. They have one national ID. We don’t have a national ID."" Shifting away from the hubbub about the proposed voter ID law, we wondered whether Mexicans have one national ID, but lack birth certificates and voter cards. In an interview, Gallego told us that ""most of (Mexico’s) population"" doesn’t have a birth certificate. ""Mexico is not at a point where they have implemented the law all across the country,"" he said. ""They don’t have the resources."" Gallego said that supporters of a voter ID in Texas are pointing to Mexico as an example of the law at work, but ""Mexicans have a national ID card for everything,"" not just voting. ""It’s just a different system,"" he said. When we asked if anyone could confirm his statements, he arranged a conference call with Rosalba Ojeda, the consul general of Mexico in Austin. Ojeda told us that birth certificates have ""been around forever"" in Mexico, but some residents in remote areas ""simply don’t get around to registering the baby."" Some people aren’t registered until they’re older, ""when they have the opportunity to go to the village,"" she said. Mexicans can register their birth at any time, Ojeda said, but it’s not necessarily easy. They must go to the local municipio, or municipal office, of their birthplace and bring witnesses who can attest to their birth in Mexico. She said that she doesn’t know what proportion of the population has a birth certificate but that the government has conducted ""a lot of campaigns"" in the ""last 15 years and so most of the people I would say now would have one."" Birth certificates are required to access hospital services and get a passport, Ojeda said. Ojeda also told us that the Mexican government is conducting a pilot project that gives citizens national IDs. According to a Jan. 25 San Diego Union-Tribune news article, Tijuana elementary school students became the first to register for the new identity card. ""The card is aimed at minors from ages 4 to 17, but by the end of 2012, Mexico’s federal government is hoping that as many as 25.7 million children will sign up,"" eventually extending ID cards to adults as well, according to the article. ""With the document, they won’t need to present a birth certificate when registering for school, medical appointments or to receive other public services."" The article also says that in Mexico, ""birth certificates and voter registration cards are the most commonly used identification documents."" Ojeda told us that a birth certificate is also required to get an electoral ID, which citizens need to vote. According to the electoral institute’s website, to vote, Mexicans must apply to the ""Electoral Roll"" by personally submitting an official form that includes their signature, fingerprint and photograph to a field office of the Federal Electoral Registry. There’s an office in every electoral district. There are some exceptions, such as for citizens who physically can’t go to the offices. Since 1991, the institute has issued free ""photo-voting cards"" — ""an essential document to exercise the right to vote,"" according to the site. They include the owner’s address, electoral district, full name, age and ID number. Kenneth Greene, an associate professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin,  told us that Mexico does have birth certificates. He said that he hasn’t seen a national ID, but that the country does have a voter ID card. Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center, told us in an e-mail that Gallego’s statement is incorrect on both counts. Selee said Mexico has birth certificates and registration cards for voters, but the country doesn’t have a national ID card. ""Their voter registration card usually serves that purpose,"" he said. ""There is discussion of creating a national ID, but it doesn’t exist yet."" While some people in rural areas don’t get birth certificates, Selee said, ""that doesn’t seem to be a major problem anymore in Mexico in the way it is in some countries like Haiti and Bolivia."" Separately, Greene pointed us to an undated report by the Mexico-based Be Foundation, which works to increase birth registration in the country. The report says Mexico ""has no simple system for registering births. For poor people in rural areas, getting a birth certificate can mean walking hours or even days to the nearest municipal office."" Karen Mercado, the foundation’s president, told us in an e-mail that ""in Mexico, more than 10 million people lack a birth certificate,"" which she said means ""no access to (citizens’) most fundamental human rights to education and health programs, protection and participation."" In a follow-up interview, Gallego told us: ""My issue is not that they do not have birth certificates — it’s that they’re not credible... it’s not that the system doesn’t exist. In practical terms, a lot of people don’t have them, and they’re not necessarily reliable."" He told us that he was referring to the voter ID when he said Mexico has one national ID. To the Truth-O-Meter. As experts pointed out, the statement misfires on three fronts. Mexicans don’t have a ""national ID card for everything,"" though a pilot project is under way to issue identity cards to minors. But the federal government issues voter IDs featuring each voter’s photo and other personal information. The government also issues birth certificates; according to experts we spoke with, less than 10 percent of residents don’t have one. We rate Gallego’s statement as False.",/factchecks/2011/feb/09/pete-gallego/rep-pete-gallego-says-mexicans-have-one-national-i/

Carter's plan to go after tax cheats has challenges
","Education eats up the largest share of the state budget, so it only makes sense that it’s consuming much of the debate in the neck-and-neck governor’s race. Nathan Deal, the Republican incumbent, says his efforts to grow jobs and the economy have paid off for schools. Hs education track record also includes work for passage of a 2012 charter school amendment and a bipartisan deal to shore up the lottery-funded HOPE scholarship and pre-K programs. His challenger, Democratic state Sen. Jason Carter of Atlanta, contends that Deal has shortchanged Georgia’s children. He’s most critical of $1-billion-a-year-plus austerity cuts to education recommended by Deal in the first three of his four state budgets. Carter, who voted for those three budgets, is promising that, if he’s elected, he will increase education spending through a three-pronged approach that involves growing the economy, cutting government waste and going after tax cheats. The latter proposal peaked the interest of our fact-checkers. We reached out to the Carter for evidence to back up the candidate’s claim. Spokesman Bryan Thomas pointed us to a January report from the state Department of Audits and Account, showing about $4.4 billion in delinquent state taxes. The report’s authors estimate that $1.9 billion of the $4.4 billion is uncollected. But Thomas said strong leadership would improve collection of that money. ""You put the force of the governor’s office behind it,"" Thomas told The Augusta Chronicle earlier this month. At a press conference on Aug. 27th, Carter told reporters; ""There’s $2.5 billion that is uncollected out there from people who are cheating on their taxes, and against whom we aren’t enforcing the law."" The auditor’s report, points out that about $815 million of the $2.5 billion is at least 15 years old – making it much harder to collect. Of course, that leaves two-thirds of the money apparently there for the taking, right? The left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute isn’t so sure the plan is viable. Executive Director Alan Essig points out that once you account for the people and businesses that lack the means to pay, you’re left with people who have intentionally dodged their responsibilities. Even when caught, those scofflaws aren’t likely to fork over the entire amount owed. Ramping up enforcement will yield more money, but just how much is unclear, he said. ""Are we talking about $3 million, $30 million, $300 million?"" Essig said. ""I don’t know what the dollar amount is, and I don’t think anyone knows it."" Carter’s proposal to track down delinquent taxpayers is nothing new. Georgia made probably its biggest push to go after tax cheats when Sonny Perdue was governor and Bart Graham was revenue commissioner. We pulled a report that showed Graham identified 420,693 taxpayers that owed a combined $1.6 billion as of September 2003. Some of that debt dated back to 1988. Graham’s agency chased down the money on several fronts. For instance, $23 million came in when the state refused to renew alcohol licenses for businesses with outstanding taxes. Another $18.6 million came in when the state began shaming scofflaws by posting their names on the internet. All told, the state’s two-year vigorous enforcement campaign collected $172.5 million – just 11 percent of what was owed. ""This is a messier process than (Carter) is suggesting,"" said Barbara Neuby, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University who specializes in public budgeting and finance. ""There is no automatic money that comes in once letters go out."" That’s because collection would be handled through regulatory enforcement. The same laws that give state agencies broad powers to enforce taxation give people the right to appeal, Neuby said. The hearing process can take months and years, especially if the delinquents hire attorneys to fight enforcement. There is also the matter that some delinquent taxpayers may have legitimate reasons they have not paid – and therefore do not actually owe, Neuby said. State House Appropriations Committee Chairman Terry England, R-Auburn, said there are complications, even if the state could collect the amount in back taxes that Carter’s claiming. ""Nobody would argue putting it into education,"" England said. ""But that’s one -time funds."" The question becomes: What about the next year? he said. We circled back out to Thomas about some of the concerns that were expressed. ""Sen. Carter has never said that this is the only way to pay for the education investments we need,"" Thomas said. ""He has identified it as one of several ways to invest in our schools."" Other efforts, such as cutting waste and improving efficiency in government, would provide sustained funding for schools, Thomas said. So where does this leave us? Carter said he believes the state can collect a substantial amount to help education by going after delinquent taxpayers. The state’s experience – and a report from state auditors – say that may be more challenging than he suggests. Carter has a point. But there’s there’s a lot of context missing from his proposal. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/sep/23/jason-carter/carters-plan-go-after-tax-cheats-has-challenges/

Charlie Crist blames Rick Scott for teacher layoffs and class size increases
","Charlie Crist has upped the ante on one of his favorite talking points: attacking Gov. Rick Scott for K-12 education cuts. In a Crist TV ad praising public school teachers, the narrator says: ""They don’t fly in private jets or float on fancy yachts, but the job Florida teachers do couldn’t be more valuable. And when Rick Scott cut education by over a billion dollars, thousands of them lost their jobs, class sizes went up, our kids paid the price."" A visual shows a 2014 Miami Herald article that cited a $1.3 billion cut to public schools. ""Why did he do it?"" the ad continues. ""To pay for millions in handouts to big corporations. Tax cuts here, budget cuts there. Thousands of teaching jobs gone."" The ad gives no indication of when those education cuts took place, but the answer is that the $1.3 billion K-12 cut came in 2011. We have already fact-checked whether Scott cut education to pay for tax breaks; we rated it Half True. Here, we will fact-check the allegation about the consequences of the budget cut. Did thousands of teachers lose their jobs? Did class sizes go up? Teacher layoffs amid budget cuts Scott entered office in 2011 facing a $3.6 billion shortfall in the state’s $70.5 billion budget. His first budget proposal, released at a tea party rally, included steep spending cuts, including reductions in education spending. After a contentious session, the Legislature passed -- and Scott signed -- a budget that included $1.3 billion in cuts to education. The reduction ended up being about $540 per student, working out to a 7.9 percent cut in funding. (We’ve broken down some of those dollar figures before.) After he faced a backlash over the cuts, Scott went on in subsequent years to back increases to K-12 education, though his high point for per-pupil spending still lags behind the high-water mark under Crist. So did ""thousands"" of teachers lose their jobs as a result of the 2011 budget cuts? We found no definitive source that shows the precise number of teacher layoffs statewide. The Crist campaign points to layoffs in a single school district: Broward. The campaign cites a June 2012 Sun-Sentinel article that stated that the district ""eliminated about 1,500 teachers"" in 2011 -- but then was poised to add 678 positions in 2012. So that figure falls short of the ""thousands"" cited by the campaign. A spokeswoman for Broward schools told PolitiFact that in June 2011, a total of 1,431 annual and probationary teachers were not reappointed, but 583 were later rehired. Additionally, 117 teachers were placed on a layoff list, but 97 were rehired. That brings the total to 868 in Broward. A caveat about Broward: State budget cuts are not the only reason for the district’s budget woes. A major factor was that the county faced rapid enrollment growth followed by a decline. Though the Crist campaign only cited an article about layoffs in a single district, layoffs occurred in other counties, too, including 315 teachers in Pasco County. (In Miami-Dade, nearly all of the teachers kept their jobs, except for some temporary teachers who received poor performance reviews.) School districts report to the state Department of Education the number of teachers they have each year. That data shows that the number of teachers between the fall of 2010 and the fall of 2011 declined by 1,405, or about 1 percent. This came as the number of students was increasing by about 24,000 between the 2010-11 school year and the 2011-12 school year. By the fall of 2012, the number of teachers exceeded the 2010 level. This data doesn’t include how much of the decline was due to layoffs, retirements or terminations -- but it’s fair to assume at least some were layoffs. The initial drop of 1,405 teachers falls short of the ""thousands"" cited by Crist. Crist, a Democrat, and Scott, a Republican, have accused each other of causing teacher layoffs. In an ad, Scott blamed Crist for ""3,000 teachers laid off"" during his tenure as governor. That claim was based on a September 2009 report about possible layoffs. Scott’s ad omitted that Crist accepted federal stimulus money that preserved thousands of teacher jobs and that the Republican-controlled Legislature shared responsibility with Crist for cuts that occurred amid a national recession. We rated Scott’s claim Mostly False. Class sizes  The second part of the claim about class sizes increasing due to budget cuts is tricky to evaluate because many factors shaped class sizes. Florida voters approved a class-size amendment in 2002, but the state phased it in over several years. The first year schools had to meet the rules at the classroom level was 2010-11. Until that point, class sizes were averaged schoolwide, and a 2010 referendum to keep the school averages failed. The cap limited 18 students between kindergarten and third grade, 22 in fourth to eighth grades, and 25 students in core high school classes. But changes made by the Legislature during Scott’s tenure make it less than meaningful to compare compliance rates from year to year. For example, in 2011, the Legislature reduced the number of courses under the mandate by two-thirds, only requiring core classes needed for graduation to follow the standard. In 2013, the Legislature changed the law so that districts could designate schools as ""schools of choice"" to get around classroom counts. That’s what Pasco did for its entire district, for instance. The Crist campaign cited only one piece of evidence on class sizes: a 2011 Miami Herald article that cited some anecdotes about very large classes in Miami-Dade, including 54 students in a college-prep world history class. According to the Florida Department of Education, here are the percentage of classes that were out of compliance: * 2010-11 (Crist)           5.48 percent * 2011-12  (Scott)          6.56 percent * 2012-13  (Scott)          4.22 percent * 2013-14  (Scott)          2.59 percent So there was a small increase -- about 1 percentage point -- from the last year of Crist to the first year of Scott. But then the numbers went back down. By December 2011, about half of the state’s school districts were in violation of the cap, including Broward and Miami-Dade and Pasco counties. Districts faced fines for violating the mandate. In Broward, more than half of the classes were not in compliance compared to a 97 percent compliance rate the year before. The Tampa Bay Times wrote that in Pasco, ""shrinking local, state and federal revenue caused the board to eliminate several hundred teaching positions in order to balance the budget. The administration and board knew that could mean some classes would exceed the state caps."" To get fined for such a budgetary storm is ""extremely frustrating,"" Pasco School Board member Steve Luikart said at the time. ""It's stand up and get whipped."" Nearly all of Miami-Dade’s classes complied with the class size rule in 2011, but the district determined it was cheaper to pay the penalty than hire more staff to meet the cap. ""It did not make economic sense at that time to comply at 100 percent,"" said Antonio Cotarelo, spokesman for the district. State law requires schools to be compliant regardless of funding, and the amount of funding specifically directed toward class size never decreased, according to a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Education. That means it is ""pretty hard to make a direct link between less total education funding and higher class sizes,"" said Cheryl Etters, Department of Education spokeswoman. If the number of teachers statewide declined by 1,400 without being replaced, ""it’s fair to assume that class sizes increased,"" said Ruth Haseman Melton, director of government relations for the Florida School Board Association. However there are a number of factors that influence class sizes, and state budget cuts are only one of them. Student enrollment is a major factor. A district may suddenly have a spike in students due to immigration or migration from other states. A district negotiating with a teachers' union might have decided to increase pay as a tradeoff for larger classes. ""There are many explanations for why a district would struggle with class size one year and not the next...,"" Melton said. ""It’s never as simple as a single sentence to explain almost anything with regard to education funding. There are always a number of factors that affect these things -- there is a not a single reason in one district or another that you could say, ‘Ah, this is the culpable element for why things went in the wrong direction.’ "" We sent Crist’s claim to a spokesman for Scott’s campaign, who responded with claims promoting Scott’s track record on education funding after his first session. For example, Greg Blair pointed to ""record"" K-12 funding under Scott -- which is accurate in terms of the total amount but not for per pupil. Our ruling Crist said that Scott cut education by over a billion dollars, meaning thousands of teachers ""lost their jobs"" and ""class sizes went up."" The kernel of truth to this claim is that the number of teachers did decline and the percentage of classes out of class-size compliance rose in 2011. But this is outweighed by a long list of omissions -- and it doesn’t reflect Scott’s complete tenure. The first problem is it glosses over the fact that the cut took place in 2011, and was later followed by increases. In addition, it is an overstatement to suggest that ""thousands"" of teachers lost their jobs due to the 2011 state budget cuts. Statewide data shows the number of teachers dropped by about 1,405, but that includes departures for any reason, not just layoffs. The percentage of class sizes out of compliance with the mandate increased by about 1 percentage point between Crist’s last budget and Scott’s first budget. However, there are multiple district and state factors that influence class size and the compliance rules have repeatedly changed in recent years. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/sep/22/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-blames-rick-scott-teacher-layoffs-an/

Senate candidate Dan Sullivan says Sen. Mark Begich has only passed one law
","Dan Sullivan, the Republican Senate candidate in Alaska, is charging that his opponent, Sen. Mark Begich, is an ineffective lawmaker compared to other Alaska senators. According to a recent Sullivan campaign mailer, Begich -- who has been in office since 2009 -- has passed zero pieces of legislation during his first term. The Sullivan campaign reinforced this line of attack in a Facebook meme that said Begich has passed one bill, and all it did was name a building. This meme compared Begich’s record to that of other Alaska senators, saying that Begich’s predecessor, the late Republican Sen. Ted Stevens, passed 13 bills during his first term in the chamber, and that current Sen. Lisa Murkowski, also a Republican, passed five during her first term. We wondered: Did only one of Begich's bills pass during his first term? And is that the only way to measure his effectiveness as a legislator? We searched the Congressional Quarterly congressional database and found that since becoming a senator in 2009, Sen. Begich has only sponsored one bill that was eventually enacted, and that bill was to name an Alaska courthouse. So Sullivan has a point. But it’s a point that should be taken with a grain of salt. First, the claim has quickly become outdated. Last week -- after the mailer and meme first appeared -- the Senate and House passed a Begich-sponsored bill to increase veterans’ disability compensation that President Barack Obama is expected to sign into law. Second, counting the number of passed bills sponsored by a lawmaker is not the only -- or even the best -- way to gauge their effectiveness. In reality, there are many ways for a member of Congress to get desired legislation to the president’s desk beyond being the bill’s chief sponsor, said Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute. ""There are some lawmakers who sponsor or cosponsor a lot of bills, but it doesn't reflect much of anything,"" he said, adding that the name on a bill that passes may be more of a reflection of who chaired the committee of jurisdiction rather than the member who actually drove the bill. Begich has co-sponsored 37 bills that became law. For seven of these laws, he was one of five or fewer co-sponsors, meaning he likely would have had tangible influence over the bill. And on three of these, Begich was the sole cosponsor of bills put forward by Murkowski, his fellow Alaska senator. All three dealt with Alaska-specific issues, such as Denali National Park. Meanwhile, a lawmaker’s name doesn’t have to be on a bill to accomplish legislative goals. Here are a few examples for Begich: • The Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2012 included a provision authored by Begich that explored the possibility of a deep-water port in the Arctic. Begich didn’t sponsor or co-sponsor that bill, which originated in the House, but he did sponsor the corresponding Senate version. • In a previous fact-check, we found that Begich had played a key role in getting Washington to open up the Arctic Ocean to oil drilling for the first time in decades. A lawyer involved with the efforts told PolitiFact at the time that Begich’s ""biggest influence has been picking up the phone or having those people into his office or in hearings and saying ‘Dammit, we need to get this done.’ "" • In 2012, Alaska Native tribal health programs signed an agreement with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs that allowed Alaska Native veterans to receive medical care in tribal areas, rather than having to travel to Anchorage or Seattle. The Alaska Army National Guard and the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium both said Begich supported that effort. • In the 2009 economic stimulus package, Begich fought for funds that benefited Alaska military bases and that helped build a hospital in Nome, Alaska, McClatchy reported. Additionally, Begich heads the Senate’s Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee, which has responsibilities beyond passing legislation, including improving the party’s relationship with traditionally Republican constituencies, according to his profile in Congressional Quarterly. So simply looking at the number of Begich-sponsored bills signed into law doesn’t give a full sense of his activities in the Senate. It’s also worth remembering that partisan gridlock has meant that a historically low number of bills are passing these days, meaning fewer opportunities for Begich -- or anyone else -- to get their names on a signed bill. As of July, about 800 bills have become law since Begich took office in 2009, according to compiled GovTrack data. If every member of Congress were to pass the same number of bills, that would break down to about 1.5 bills per person over the 5.5-year period. It was much different in Stevens’ first term, which ran from 1969 to 1974. Congress passed nearly 800 bills between 1973 and 1974 alone. (We don’t have data back further than that.) That breaks down to about 1.5 bills per person in just two years. Our ruling Sullivan said Begich is ineffective because he has passed only ""one bill, the naming of a building."" Technically, Sullivan has a point -- at the time Sullivan’s post went up, Begich had only sponsored one bill that was eventually enacted, and it named a courthouse. Another Begich-sponsored bill concerning veterans’ issues subsequently passed both the House and Senate. However, this is an oversimplification, since Begich has had success pushing a legislative agenda in ways that don’t end up with his name on an enacted bill. Notably, Begich has been one of a small number of co-sponsors on bills that have passed, and legislative language he sponsored has ended up enacted in bills with someone else’s name on it. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/sep/22/dan-sullivan/senate-candidate-dan-sullivan-says-sen-mark-begich/

In ad to promote Rick Scott, Rothstein investor says he was 'swindled' by Charlie Crist
","A TV ad released by the Republican Party of Florida has created major buzz in Florida’s political world. The ad featured an unidentified man who said he was swindled by Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein -- and, by extension, by former Gov. Charlie Crist, who is now a Democrat and seeking to unseat Florida Gov. Rick Scott. ""Scott Rothstein swindled a lot of people, me included,"" the unidentified narrator said. ""He bankrupted many families. Nobody was closer to Rothstein than Charlie Crist. Rothstein was always around Charlie, throwing parties and giving Charlie money. Rothstein bragged that he gave Charlie Crist money so he could pick judges. Of course Charlie took the money. I got swindled by both Rothstein and Charlie. If Charlie Crist will sell judgeships, everything is for sale."" The ad -- which has run at least 4,000 times at a cost of about $2 million -- includes photos of Rothstein and Crist embracing each other and blowing out the candles on Crist’s 52nd birthday cake. (Technical note: The ad was released by the state Republican Party, but it is on Scott’s behalf. Scott’s campaign has been defending it and he initially referred questions about the ad to his campaign. So that's why we're putting Scott on the Truth-O-Meter.) PolitiFact Florida has previously fact-checked two claims related to Rothstein, who began a 50-year prison sentence in 2010 for convictions related to a $1.4 billion Ponzi scheme that involved the sale of fabricated legal settlements. But Scott’s charge that Crist ""swindled"" an investor is new -- and represents a serious charge. Crist unveiled his own counter-attack that calls the ad a lie and recounts Scott’s $1.7 billion Medicare fraud related to his days as CEO of a health care company. We decided to put it to the Truth-O-Meter. We’ve relied heavily on the work of Miami Herald political writer Marc Caputo and federal courts reporter Jay Weaver. On Sept. 16, Caputo and Weaver broke the story that the investor was Dean Kretschmar of Fort Lauderdale. The investor’s lawsuit didn’t mention Crist Kretschmar was part of an investor group known as Razorback that invested with Rothstein. On or around June 2009, Kretschmar invested $8 million, according to the lawsuit Kretschmar and other investors filed in November 2009. The lawsuit named several defendants, including Rothstein and TD Bank, the banker for Rothstein’s law firm. Crist’s name isn’t mentioned in the lawsuit. The group sought $190 million and settled for $170 million with TD Bank, the Herald reported. The newspaper reported that Kretschmar recouped most of his investment. Unmentioned in the ad is that Kretschmar’s lawyer is William R. Scherer, a Scott donor. Earlier this year, Scott’s office hired Scherer’s law firm to sue Digital Domain, a digital effects company that had animated the scenes in Titanic and the Transformers movies. Under Crist, the company received $20 million from the state but in 2012 shut down its Florida operation and declared bankruptcy without creating the hundreds of jobs it had promised the state. (Scherer told the Herald the point of the ad was that Crist took Rothstein’s money — about $81,000 for Crist’s unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in 2010 — at the same time that Kretschmar was being ripped off. But none of that is explained in the ad.) Kretschmar has given about $19,000 to state and federal GOP candidates and committees, including -- ironically -- $500 to Crist when he ran for governor as a Republican in 2006. Scott’s response The pro-Scott ad’s backup cites several articles about Rothstein’s court testimony earlier this year in a case involving a former employee of his law firm. Rothstein testified that he bought Crist’s judicial picks, but did not mention Kretschmar. During a campaign stop in Miami, Scott told the Herald’s Caputo that his ad wasn’t intended to say that Crist was an active participant in the fraud; rather, it was intended to be more metaphorical, equating Crist’s political flip-flops with Rothstein’s swindles. From the Herald: ""This individual was a victim of both Scott Rothstein and Charlie Crist. Both of them promised things, and they didn’t come through,"" Scott said. ""Charlie said he was a Ronald Reagan Republican. He was against tax increases. He was against raising your tuition. And he did both,"" Scott said, repeating variations of this argument when reporters sought clarification. ""Charlie was a Republican and then an independent then a Democrat."" Scott campaign manager Melissa Sellers cited a list of political positions that Crist has flip-flopped, such as gay marriage. PolitiFact has confirmed a number of such flip-flops. But none of these flip-flops are remotely connected to Rothstein’s criminal acts. And Merriam-Webster's online dictionary defines ""swindle"" as ""to obtain money or property by fraud or deceit,"" a definition that doesn’t extend to policy flip-flops. (The Florida GOP isn’t giving up on the ""swindle"" argument -- a new web ad released on Sept. 22 says ""Crist swindled Florida. Swindled his own supporters. Swindled voters with promises made and promises broken."" That ad focuses on Crist’s flip-flops and doesn’t mention Rothstein.) Sellers also argued that ""no one ever said Crist was not part of the Rothstein investigation."" The campaign points to a January 2012 article in the Miami Herald about charges pending for others involved in Rothstein’s scheme. (So far, there have been more than 20 separate convictions.) The article included information from Rothstein’s 10-day deposition in a civil case, in which an attorney asked Rothstein if he ""conned"" or ""‘fooled"" a list of big-name national politicians, including GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain. Rothstein testified that he ""fooled"" them all. Rothstein was then asked by an attorney whether he ""fooled"" Crist or former U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Fla. The Herald wrote that ""Rothstein was not allowed to answer the questions about the two Florida politicians because of objections raised by the lead federal prosecutor in the criminal case, Lawrence LaVecchio, who cited 'investigatory privilege.' Legal experts said LaVecchio objected because his team is still investigating political donations that Rothstein and other members of his firm made to their campaigns."" Rothstein testified this year in a separate criminal case involving a former employee that Crist made judicial appointments in return for Rothstein’s donations. But the Herald reported in September that federal investigators examined Rothstein-related donations to Crist in 2010 and have found no evidence of wrongdoing and are not actively investigating the charge. A Republican Party of Florida television ad from August asserted that Rothstein ""gave hundreds of thousands of campaign cash to control Crist’s appointments of key state judges."" Rothstein and his firm donated to Crist and RPOF -- in addition to a long list of politicians and candidates from both parties. Crist appointed Rothstein to serve on a commission that recommended appeals judges, but he was only one of nine votes. To say that Rothstein controlled the appointments is an overstatement, which led us to rate that claim Half True. Our ruling A TV ad by Scott quotes a Rothstein victim who says that he was ""swindled"" by Crist, but that’s a gross distortion. Kretschmar was swindled by Rothstein, but the ad provides no evidence that he was ""swindled"" by Crist as well. Scott and his campaign argue that the comparison between the ""swindles"" by Rothstein and Crist is metaphorical, with Crist having ""swindled"" voters by changing his positions on political issues like same-sex marriage. However, the way the accusation was framed in the ad leaves viewers with the impression that Crist was part of Rothstein’s criminal Ponzi scheme -- he was not. The ad’s equation of the two is ridiculous, so we rate the claim Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2014/sep/22/rick-scott/ad-promote-rick-scott-rothstein-investor-says-he-w/

Among them is a passage from the U.S. Senate website, which says the Constitution is ""The world’s longest surviving written charter of government."" Breeding noted that similar statements appear on the websites of the National Archives, Encyclopedia Britannica, and The Constitution Center in Philadelphia -- a museum dedicated to the U.S. Constitution. We ran Goodlatte’s statement by Tom Ginsburg , a University of Chicago professor and a principal investigator with the Comparative Constitutions Project, which has examined national constitutions around the world. He agreed with the congressman and directed us to a list his group has compiled on when national constitutions were enacted. The oldest one is the United States’. Although signed in 1787, it needed to be ratified by the states and didn’t go into effect until 1789. Next on the seniority list is Norway, which enacted its constitution in 1814,  and then Belgium, in 1831. Although we may think of constitutions as yellowing pieces of parchment, that’s not always the case. Only half live more than 19 years, according to a summary of a 2009 book that Ginsburg co-wrote about constitutions around the world. While many constitutional experts agree with Goodlatte, his statement does not get unanimous ratification. As our colleagues at PolitiFact noted in 2011, there’s a debate among scholars over whether some countries have an older constitution than the U.S. It all depends on how you define a constitution. Merriam Webster’s dictionary defines the term a couple of ways. One of them is as a governing document. But another way is as a ""system of beliefs and laws by which a country, state or organization is governed."" Some countries don’t have a formal central constitution like the U.S., but rather pull from a collection of laws, practices and texts that date back centuries. For example, the tiny country of San Marino, landlocked by Italy, bases its government on various ""legislative instruments,"" including a series of written laws enacted in 1600, according to the Central Intelligence Agency’s World Factbook. The United Kingdom, is said to have an  ""unwritten"" constitution based on common law, practices and various statutes -- including the Magna Carta, which was written in the 13th century. John Paul Jones, a professor of law emeritus at the University of Richmond, said Goodlatte’s statement is essentially correct. But Jones qualified his conclusion by pointing to the United Kingdom’s constitution. Although largely unwritten, Jones said it does contain some centuries-old texts including ""three or four documents that predate 1789."" What makes the U.S. Constitution so enduring? We asked Lynn Uzzell, the scholar in residence at Montpelier, the home of President James Madison, who was one of the most frequent speakers at the 1787 Constitutional Convention. Uzzell said she thinks it’s because the document is based on a lot of sound principles guarding against abuse of power. She also said it’s a relatively simple and short document with a lot of flexibility allowing the country to respond to developing circumstances.   A final note: Goodlatte’s office justifies his statement by citing documents that compare the U.S. Constitution to other countries around the world. But we also wondered whether any of the original U.S. states has a working constitution older than our national document. The answer is yes; Massachusetts enacted its state constitution in 1780. That means it was adopted seven years before the U.S. Constitution was written. Our ruling Goodlatte says the U.S. constitution is the ""oldest written constitution still in use today."" He was referring to national constitutions. Some scholars note that the United Kingdom and San Marino have some written governing documents still in effect that predate the 1789 enactment of the U.S. Constitution. But as a single document laying out an overall framework for governing a country -- a common way many people would define a constitution -- the U.S. truly has the oldest one still working.

Libertarian on mark with state budget claim
","Smaller government. Lower taxes. More freedom. That’s the mantra of the Georgia Libertarian Party, which, this year, is fielding candidates for a handful of state offices, including governor. In Cherokee County, attorney and Libertarian Jeff Amason is running as a write-in candidate for the District 21 House seat. That seat is currently held by Scot Turner, a one-term Republican from Holly Springs. Amason recently appeared on the Monica Perez Show on WSB radio to discuss his candidacy and priorities, including reining in state spending. ""The state budget has increased almost $800 million a year in each of the last two years. You can only imagine what it might be in five years,"" Amason said. ""We need to be funding essential programs. We don’t need to be funding every program out there."" With the economy making a slow but steady recovery, we decided to fact check Amason’s budget claims. We contacted him, and he sent us budget figures for the state fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2014, as well as for the current fiscal year, which started July 1. That data showed that the total state budget grew from $18.5 billion in 2012 to $19.3 billion in Fiscal 2013 and to $20.2 billion in 2014. That’s a jump of $800 million between 2012 to 2013 and a $900 million increase between 2013 to 2014. We confirmed the accuracy of Amason’s numbers using budget documents available at the Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget website. (We didn’t compare the 2014 and 2015 budgets because the General Assembly will amend the 2015 spending plan in the legislative session that starts in January.) Helping to drive up the recent state budgets were increases in enrollment in public schools, Medicaid and the state’s health insurance program for children, as well as pension costs, according to state documents. Current spending levels are 26.7 percent above 2005 levels, not adjusted for inflation, an OPB report shows. In summary, Amason said the state budget increased nearly $800 million a year in each of the last two years. He was very close, if not conservative in his assessment..

Katrina vanden Heuvel: Americans support airstrikes against ISIS but not ground troops
","Progressives, wary of another open-ended conflict in the Middle East, are concerned President Barack Obama is bending to war hawks in Washington by using the military to stop the march of the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. On ABC’s This Week, Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor of the left-leaning magazine The Nation, said Obama has moved away from his foreign policy principle of ""don’t do stupid stuff"" and ""surrendered to war party in both parties, to a media that has lathered up hysteria about a threat that is not an immediate threat to this country."" She questioned whether Americans are on board with increased military involvement. ""There's a barbarism and a gruesomeness to the videotapes (of the Islamic State beheading two American journalists) which have moved the American people at this stage to support strikes, but the support for ground troops is not there,"" vanden Heuvel said. ""The support is very thin."" Did vanden Heuvel accurately capture the sentiment from Americans? We decided to take a look at the polling data. Airstrikes At Obama’s direction, the military began a targeted airstrike campaign in Iraq earlier this month against the Islamic State, a terrorist group operating in Iraq and Syria that is also called ISIS or ISIL. We found a number of recent surveys that asked respondents how they felt about this decision. As vanden Heuvel suggested, there’s significant majority support for airstrikes. According to a CNN poll published Sept. 8, 76 percent of Americans backed additional airstrikes against the Islamic State. Just 23 percent opposed. The results were consistent with several other recent polls. Washington Post/ABC News (Sept. 4-7) Reuters/Ipsos (Sept. 10-12) Huffington Post/YouGov (Sept. 18-19) Strongly support 52 42 34 Somewhat support 19 22 32 Strongly oppose 11 12 10 Somewhat oppose 12 9 9 Other 6 16 16 Vanden Heuvel also said that the Islamic State’s beheading of two American journalists was the tipping point for public support of airstrikes. The videos contained a ""barbarism and a gruesomeness"" that ""moved"" Americans to back Obama on this, she said. However, polls don’t exactly bear that out. A Washington Post/ABC poll from Aug. 13-17, found majority support, 54 percent, for airstrikes against the Islamic State. That poll was conducted before Aug. 19, when the Islamic State released footage of a Sunni insurgent beheading journalist James Foley. A Pew Research Center/USA Today poll released Aug. 18 -- also before the videos were released -- showed 54 percent of Americans supported airstrikes while just 34 percent opposed. Even earlier in the summer, the country was split on whether to launch airstrikes. A Washington Post/ABC poll from June 22 found 45 percent of respondents backed airstrikes and 46 percent opposed them. So it’s not as though the pro-airstrike crowd was weak months before the beheadings, either. While support for airstrikes jumped in the aftermath of the gruesome videos, it was already building and above 50 percent before news outlets learned two journalists were beheaded. Ground troops Obama has vowed not to get American troops directly involved in combat in Iraq and Syria. Polls are mixed, but it does not seem that there’s a great appetite for ""boots on the ground,"" as some may say. The September Reuters poll allowed respondents to select multiple actions they deemed appropriate for America to take to fight the Islamic State. Choices ranged from humanitarian aid to no intervention at all. Just 9 percent of respondents favored sending troops, easily the least-chosen option. Similarly, CNN found two-thirds of Americans opposed ground troops while about one-third supported it. The Huffington Post/YouGov poll (the most-recent poll we found) had a far less definitive result. Asked if they would support or oppose ground troops in Iraq and Syria to fight the Islamic State, 38 percent expressed some support while 44 percent were against it. So a plurality opposed the move, but it was much closer than other surveys. On This Week, vanden Heuvel embellished a bit when she said support for ground troops to fight the Islamic State was ""not there"" and ""very thin,"" but her general point is on target. Polls found at least a plurality opposed sending combat troops to fight the Islamic State. Our ruling Vanden Heuvel said Americans now ""support strikes (to fight the Islamic State) but the support for ground troops is not there. The support is very thin."" In general, vanden Heuvel captures the sentiment of the American people. But she over-exaggerates the influence of videos showing beheadings of journalists on Americans' attitudes about airstrikes. There was already majority support for airstrikes before the killing of the first journalist, James Foley. It is also a stretch to say support for ground troops is ""not there"" or ""very thin."" It is a minority opinion, but at least two polls show one-third of Americans support the idea. On balance, we rate her claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/sep/21/katrina-vanden-heuvel/katrina-vanden-heuvel-americans-support-air-strike/

George Will: NFL fans love the NFL too much to quit watching over Ray Rice
","Not even the Ray Rice scandal could yank professional football games from the top of television viewership rankings, said conservative commentator George Will. Will participated in a Fox News Sunday political panel dissecting the NFL’s response to the video showing Rice, a former Baltimore Ravens running back, assaulting his now-wife in an elevator. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell’s performance has been widely criticized, but Will predicted he will survive the scandal. Why? America’s real pastime is an economic behemoth that can’t be stopped. ""Last week’s three most-viewed television programs were Sunday Night Football, Thursday Night Football and Monday Night Football,"" he said. ""And money talks and it will continue to talk. And this will pass over, and football will go on its merry way."" It’s no secret that professional football has a big TV audience. We wanted to know just how big. By the numbers To check Will’s claim we looked to a top-10 ranking of shows by the Nielsen Company, which tracks consumer trends, including television viewership, from the week of Monday, Sept. 8, through Sunday, Sept. 14. It is the most-recent week available. That Monday, TMZ released a video showing Rice punching his now-wife in an elevator. On the same day, the Baltimore Ravens terminated their contract with Rice, and Goodell announced that Rice was on indefinite suspension. Later in the week, the Associated Press reported that NFL executives were supposedly aware of this video months earlier. Nielsen has separate top-10 lists for broadcast television and cable television. Because Monday Night Football appears on ESPN, we decided to combine the lists into one overall ranking. Here are the top 10 shows and their viewership (in millions) that week: 1. NBC Sunday Night Football (22.1) 2. CBS Thursday Night Football (20.8) 3. NBC Sunday Night NFL Pre-Kick show (16.7) 4. CBS NFL Thursday Night Pre-Kick show (13.9) 5. ESPN Monday Night Football - New York/Detroit (13.7) 6. CBS 60 Minutes (12.3) 7. NBC Football Night in America (12.4) 8. ESPN Monday Night Football - San Diego/Arizona (11.5) 9. CBS NFL Thursday Night Kickoff (10.6) 10. CBS America’s Got Talent (10.5) As you can see, there’s a lot of love for professional football. Americans don’t just love the games -- they love the pregame shows, too. The popularity of the pregame shows on NBC and CBS pushed the Monday Night Football game between the New York Giants and Detroit Lions to No. 5. So Will’s comment, by Nielsen’s metrics, is a tad off. Still, the point holds: Pro football games and pre- and post-game analysis dominated 8 out of 10 of the top 10 shows. Only CBS’ America’s Got Talent and 60 Minutes cracked the list. Of course, excitement for NFL games is high since the season started just a couple weeks ago, and the networks’ fall television programming hasn’t fully kicked in just yet. Even so, NFL games and analysis will continue to dominate the rankings as the season goes on, said Marc Berman, editor-in-chief of TV Media Insights, in an interview with PunditFact. When new shows begin to air, the number of ""households using television"" goes up, but they don’t take viewers away from football, Berman said. The popularity of the teams playing and whether the game is exciting have a bigger effect on football viewership ratings. Numerous Nielsen statistics show professional football’s seemingly permanent first-place spot. In the 2013-14 season, NBC’s Sunday Night Football was the most-watched primetime show, with 21.7 million average viewers. ESPN’s Monday Night Football was the No. 1 most-viewed cable television show in 2013. The NFL holds 34 of the 35 most-watched individual shows in the fall of 2013. (The odd one out was NBC’s Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade at No. 22.) And in four of the past five years, the Super Bowl has broken the record for the most-watched television event in history. Professional football stands out from other sports, said Dan Lebowitz, executive director of Northeastern University’s Center for the Study of Sports and Society. In football, there are only 16 games in a typical season -- as opposed to baseball’s 162 games and basketball’s 82 games -- so each game becomes a major event. The rise of fantasy football has further solidified the sport’s popularity, Lebowitz said. The scandals involving Rice and other NFL standouts can’t make even a small dent in this trend because of football’s widespread popularity and importance in American culture, Berman said. ""Football will outlive all of us,"" he said. Our ruling Will said, ""Last week’s three most-viewed television programs were Sunday Night Football, Thursday Night Football and Monday Night Football."" Football games and related programming accounted for eight of the top 10 most-viewed TV programs between Sept. 8-14, 2014. Even though Monday Night Football came in fifth, not third, Will was right to say that football dominated the rankings. Experts say it will continue to do just that.

Todd Staples airs smoky claim about children not getting protein unless they're served meat
","Todd Staples, the Texas state agriculture commissioner, recently described a veggie-based dietary awareness campaign in the schools as an activist movement that degrades children’s nutrition to push an agenda. Meatless Monday is pretty self-explanatory; it’s an awareness campaign that encourages people to abstain once weekly from eating meat. The program was born in 2003 as a health initiative out of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health with stated goals of improving people’s health and lowering fuel and water costs of food production by encouraging lower meat consumption. It has since spread to participants that include hundreds of schools, universities and restaurants in 24 countries. But the arrival of the Baltimore-based program at three elementary schools in the Dripping Springs Independent School District made Staples ""very concerned,"" he said in a Sept. 8, 2014, commentary in the Austin American-Statesman. For Staples, excluding meat is not just a matter of taste – it’s a blow to daily nutrition, especially if students are not well nourished at home. ""It is important to remember that for many underprivileged children the meals they eat at school often represent their best meals of the day. To deprive them of a meat-based protein during school lunch is most likely depriving them of their only source of protein for the day,"" Staples wrote. Was Staples right about kids getting shorted? Let’s look at the meals that drew his ire, then explore if affected children are not getting needed proteins. Warning: Flames ahead. Dining options on a Meatless Monday Generally in Dripping Springs, lunching students may select up to one meat/meat alternate, three fruit or vegetable dishes and one grain or milk dish. If a child forgoes a meat/meat alternate, he or she is allowed four fruit or vegetable dishes. A student must take a minimum of three dishes with at least one serving of fruit or vegetable. On any day, of course, there's a chance a child won't choose to eat any protein dishes. The lunch menu at Dripping Springs Elementary, which participates in Meatless Mondays, runs on a three-week cycle. On the first Monday, when meat is not an option, the school offers vegetarian chili with cornbread, grilled cheese sandwiches, assorted vegetarian soups, cheese nachos, a baked potato with fixings, ""healthy"" refried beans, crunchy vegetable dippers and chilled pears or fresh fruit. On the second Monday of the school’s cycle, the menu includes cheese ravioli, vegetarian chili, cornbread, mozzarella sticks with marinara, a baked potato with fixings, spinach salad, green beans, apple sauce and fresh fruit. On the third Monday, the cafeteria offers black bean burritos, bean and cheese burritos, vegetarian chili, corn bread, cheese nachos, a baked potato with fixings, ""healthy"" refried beans, ""carrot babies"" with ranch, chilled sliced peaches and fresh fruit.    This is a Meatless Monday menu from Dripping Springs Elementary, as presented online by the school. Staples’ backup information By email, Staples spokesman Bryan Black pointed out the website of First Lady Michelle Obama’s school nutrition program, Let’s Move, hosted by the federal government and affiliated with the White House, which says: ""Many children consume at least half of their meals at school, and for many children, food served at school may be the only food they regularly eat."" We heard from Black before Staples announced he plans to resign to become president of the Texas Oil and Gas Association. Black said the website ""is dedicated to healthy lifestyles for children and confirms the message from Commissioner Staples"" that many students might not have access to protein at home. John Crowley, head of the Dripping Springs Independent School District’s nutrition program, said 14.03 percent of students in the Dripping Springs Independent School District receive free or reduced-price school meals. Children from families with incomes at 185 percent of the poverty line and less qualify for reduced-price school meals under federal guidelines. Non-meat proteins  Another federal publication, Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010, accessed at health.gov, describes the vitality of protein to a balanced diet. It also lists protein-rich foods that go beyond meat. Those include milk and milk products such as cheese, as well as beans, peas, nuts, seeds and soy products. We sent an inquiry on the quality and quantity of proteins in non-meat foods to the Nutrition and Food Science Department at Texas A&M University, and our questions were referred to Dr. Peter Murano, who worked for several years as deputy administrator at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service. ""It is certainly the case that meat foods, as well as dairy foods and eggs, are widely known to be the best sources of high quality, complete protein – which means that all of the essential amino acids that a child needs will be present, and in a highly digestible/utilizable form,"" he said in an email. ""It is however recognized that by pairing incomplete protein plant-based foods, such as beans and rice, that each complements the other, and the combination is also a good source of protein,"" he said. Murano said some common pairings of incomplete proteins to make complete proteins include beans and rice, peanut butter and bread (wheat) and corn and lima beans. A complete protein includes all nine essential amino acids that the body uses to build flesh as well as hormones and enzymes. With incomplete protein sources, like unpaired beans, the body will not be able to make new material like hormones and flesh. However, Murano said that even on a vegetarian diet, one could have a healthy protein diet by consuming a complete protein or accurately paired incomplete proteins ""several times a week."" An online search led us via HealthProfs.com, a directory of health professionals, to Stephanie Turkel, a registered dietitian nutritionist with a private practice in Plano. She said by phone that substituting meat with even an incomplete protein, like nuts or beans, once a week is ""just fine."" Turkel said: ""You don’t have to get everything you need in one day. It’s over the course of a week that you should see if you’ve gotten everything you need."" Federal standards for nutritious meals Crowley said the Dripping Springs cafeterias are required to follow the federal Department of Agriculture’s Guidelines for the National School Lunch and Breakfast Program, which require meals be ""nutritionally balanced,"" according to the agency’s Food and Nutrition Service website. Daily, schools must offer at least one meat or ""meat alternate"" option, the guidelines say. According to the Nutrition Standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs, ""offering a meat/meat alternate daily as part of the school lunch supplies protein, B vitamins, vitamin E, iron, zinc and magnesium to the diet of children, and also teaches them to recognize the components of a balanced meal. Menu planners are encouraged to offer a variety of protein foods (e.g., lean or extra lean meats, seafood, and poultry; beans and peas; fat-free and low-fat milk products; and unsalted nuts and seeds) to meet the meat/meat alternate requirement."" The guidelines also say: ""USDA wishes to clarify that schools have the option to offer mature beans and dry peas (e.g., kidney beans, pinto beans, black beans, garbanzo beans/ chickpeas, black-eyed peas, split peas and lentils) as meat alternates. Mature beans and peas dry longer on the plant, fix more nitrogen, and have a higher protein content, which makes them nutritionally comparable to protein foods."" As we looked into Staples’ claim, the online Culturemap Dallas reported the Texas Department of Agriculture had removed guidelines for healthy children’s meals from an agency website after Staples objected to the meatless lunches. The guidelines, published by Square Meals, the agency’s school nutrition education and outreach program, advise that children ""substitute beans for meat once a week."" Culturemap Dallas quoted Black saying the document was taken offline because it ""offered advice that was neither complete nor scientifically based and does not reflect the position of the agency."" Our ruling Staples wrote: ""To deprive"" underprivileged children ""of a meat-based protein during school lunch is most likely depriving them of their only source of protein for the day."" He offered no full-fledged backup for this claim while the Austin-area school he singled out as demonstrating this shortcoming follows a menu written to satisfy federal requirements schools serve a protein meeting dietary needs, whether it’s meat or not, every day.

Ex-Mayor Cianci says Providence had $7-million surplus in 2002, but $110-million deficit in 2008
","""A lot can change in a city after 12 years without leadership,"" Vincent A. ""Buddy"" Cianci says in the first TV commercial he’s released as part of his latest campaign for mayor of Providence. In the 30-second spot that started airing Sept. 10, 2014, Cianci draws a number of comparisons between the state of Providence when he left office in 2002 (for a federal prison cell) and the state of the city in the years that followed. We can sum up his message pretty succinctly: things were good when he was in charge and bad under his successors. ""When I left office, there was a $7-million surplus in Providence,"" Cianci says as the left side of a split screen with the year 2002 at the bottom displays an official-looking letter. As he speaks, the right side of the screen, with the year 2008 at the bottom, reads, ""$110 Million Deficit."" That was when David Cicilline, now one of Rhode Island’s two U.S. representatives, was in his second term as mayor and before Angel Taveras took office. It’s no secret that Providence’s finances have been in dire straits for much of the last decade, but did the city really plummet into such a deep hole just six years after Cianci’s last year in office? Cianci told us that the first part -- the surplus when he stepped down -- was taken from an Aug. 23, 2002 letter sent to him by Alex Prignano, then the city’s Finance Director. In the letter -- the one that’s shown during the commercial -- Prignano said that the city had a surplus of $7.3 million as of June 30, 2001, the most recent audited numbers at the time. And, added Prignano in the letter, ""Fiscal 2002 has just ended and though unaudited, the surplus is anticipated to be once again over $7.0 million."" Prignano, it turned out, was right. The surplus had grown in the 2002 fiscal year, rising to $8.3 million as of June 30 of that year, according to city financial reports. (See page 11 of this report.) In respect to the surplus, Cianci was a little conservative in the commercial. When he left office it was actually higher than he claimed. So what about the second part of the claim? Did the deficit really reach $110 million in 2008? Cianci told us that he pulled that number from Providence Journal stories on the city’s precarious financial state after Taveras took over from Cicilline in 2011. Those stories, as Cianci correctly noted, were based on a report on city finances commissioned by Taveras when he took office. That report, which was compiled by a four-person panel of financial experts that included Prignano and former state Auditor General Ernest Almonte, projected a structural deficit in the city in the 2011-2012 fiscal year, the first full fiscal year of the Taveras administration, of $110 million. We’ll get to the reason why they used the word ""structural"" in describing the deficit, and the importance of that word, in a moment, but first, let’s point out that there’s an obvious discrepancy in the year of their projection -- 2011 -- and the year Cianci uses in his commercial -- 2008. ""It didn’t happen overnight,"" Cianci explained. ""It happened over the course of four or five years."" By that logic, he argued, the $110-million figure in the report was just as true in 2008 as it was in 2011. The Taveras report doesn’t go back and assess what the structural deficit was in 2008 -- or whether there was one -- but it does look at the situation that the new mayor inherited from the Cicilline administration in the 2010-2011 fiscal year, estimating a structural deficit then of $70 million. Now let’s get back to why we keep using the words ""structural deficit"" and not just ""deficit."" We addressed this issue recently in another Politifact Rhode Island item that also focused on Providence’s finances. A person or an entity has a structural deficit if their projected expenses for the coming year exceed their projected income for the same period, Edward M. Mazze, former dean and current professor of business at the University of Rhode Island, said in that piece. In other words, it’s a forward-looking number. Knowing what could happen without action, the Taveras administration worked with city unions to bring down costs for the 2012 fiscal year. The result: a deficit of $11.4 million that year, far short of the projected $110-million structural deficit. So was Providence running a deficit, as the Cianci commercial says, back in 2008? The simple answer is no. After Cicilline took office in 2003, the city’s surplus grew steadily. It actually stood at $22.3 million as of June 30, 2008 -- nearly three times what it was when Cianci left office in 2002. In the years that followed, however, the Cicilline administration drastically reduced those reserves to balance the budget. It also took tens of millions of dollars in loans. Cicilline has blamed the Great Recession and said he had little choice but to use the money to make up for a loss in state aid and to replace one-time federal stimulus dollars. Others have said he acted irresponsibly. The end result was that by early 2011, a couple months after Cicilline left office, there was only $220,000 left in the account -- a meager amount for a city Providence’s size, but still a surplus. We pointed this out to Cianci. In response, he referred to concerns raised in 2009 about the city’s budget practices by James J. Lombardi III, then Providence’s internal auditor and the current city treasurer. At the time, he warned repeatedly that the city’s continued use of reserves to fund the budget was unsustainable. Cianci’s point is that the seeds of Providence’s financial problems were planted around 2008. ""That’s when the deficit started to build,"" he said. Some, including Cicilline and Taveras, have contended that the problems actually began during Cianci’s tenure when the city failed for years to make adequate contributions to its pension fund. (See page 9 of this actuarial report.) We asked Lombardi if he ever estimated a structural deficit for the city before Taveras took office. He couldn’t give a definitive answer, saying that his records from that period have been archived. But he did say that his concerns were probably more narrowly focused. Our ruling In a TV commercial, former Providence Mayor Cianci says, ""When I left office, there was a $7-million surplus in Providence,"" but in 2008, the city had a $110-million deficit. That certainly sounds dramatic. But it’s not entirely accurate. While he was right about the surplus -- it was actually a little higher than he claimed -- he was wrong about the deficit. There’s an argument to be made that some type of structural deficit existed in 2008, but pegging that number at $110-million is a big leap. And Cianci’s claim ignores the difference -- a big one -- between a deficit and a structural deficit. Finally, the ad implies that things were rosy under Cianci and went downhill after he left. That ignores the future problems he caused by underfunding the pension system, the effects of the Great Recession, and the strides Taveras made to bring the city back from the brink of bankruptcy. The judges were split on this one, but ultimately ruled Half True.

In a recent radio ad, Shaheen accused Brown of being too friendly with Wall Street when serving as a senator from neighboring Massachusetts from 2010 to 2012. Here’s the 60-second ad’s narration: ""Wonder why Scott Brown lost re-election in Massachusetts? Well, he was working for Wall Street, not the people. Scott Brown blocked a major financial reform bill until he could water it down and save Wall Street $19 billion. Scott Brown really delivered for Wall Street, said the Boston Globe. Even after the bill passed, news reports show Brown was ‘secretly serving the interests of Wall Street, working behind the scenes to help the big banks, not consumers.’ ""Wall Street thanked Scott Brown by giving him more campaign contributions than any other candidate -- $5.3 million. Now, Scott Brown wants New Hampshire to send him to Washington. Wall Street’s once again spending millions to help. Scott Brown says he really cares about New Hampshire. Come on, don’t be fooled. No matter where he lives, Scott Brown will always put Wall Street first. And that’s good for Scott Brown, but not New Hampshire."" That’s a lot to chew on. PolitiFact New Hampshire already checked a claim by a pro-Shaheen group that Brown’s actions had saved ""big banks $19 billion in taxes,"" rating it Mostly False. But what about the ad’s claim that ""Wall Street"" gave him ""more campaign contributions than any other candidate -- $5.3 million""? We decided to take a closer look. The Shaheen campaign pointed us to calculations by the Center for Responsive Politics, whose opensecrets.org website tracks a wide variety of campaign-finance data. It’s a trusted source that we’ve used many times in the past. The Shaheen campaign’s $5.3 million figure refers to how much Brown received in the 2012 campaign cycle -- when he lost his seat to Democrat Elizabeth Warren -- from donors categorized as being part of the finance, insurance and real estate sector. Their dollar figure is correct -- as is Brown’s No. 1 ranking among all Senate candidates for donations from that sector -- but Shaheen’s ad stretches a bit when it calls this ""Wall Street."" Most ""finance"" firms have a reasonable claim on being part of Wall Street, but a lot of the insurance and real-estate sectors fall outside that category. Also, not everyone working at these firms is a financial mogul, but their individual donations still count towards the total.   So we decided to drill down a little deeper. We found a few sub-categories of ""finance/insurance/real estate"" that are a closer fit to ""Wall Street."" They include: • Securities and investment: Brown ranked first among Senate candidates in the 2012 campaign cycle with $2,682,872. • Private equity and investment firms: Brown ranked first with $556,092 in donations. • Hedge funds: Brown ranked first with $306,800 in donations. • Venture capital: Brown ranked first with $262,081 in donations. This provides support for the notion that Brown ranked No. 1 in these types of donations. But he ranked a little lower in two other categories: • Finance and credit companies: Brown ranked ninth with $54,450 in donations. • Commercial banks: Brown ranked third with $297,539 in donations. Meanwhile, Brown’s total haul from these six categories was about $4.2 million, or about one-fifth lower than what the ad said. This is not the first time that Shaheen’s campaign has used somewhat loose language in describing Brown’s donors. When a previous Shaheen ad claimed that ""Big Oil gave Scott Brown $454,260,"" we rated that claim Half True, noting that only about 11.5 percent of Brown’s haul came from companies and individuals affiliated with the biggest multinational companies -- what most viewers would consider ""Big Oil."" When we contacted Brown’s staff, spokeswoman Elizabeth Guyton said, ""Scott Brown’s fundraising is no different than Jeanne Shaheen’s in that they both accept contributions from the financial services industry. The only difference is that Jeanne Shaheen is hypocritically attacking him for it."" However, in the 2012 election cycle -- when Brown was receiving $5.3 million from the finance/insurance/real estate sector -- Shaheen accepted just $64,139 from the same sector, ranking 65th among all Senate candidates. In the current cycle, she has accepted $565,935 from the finance/insurance/real estate sector, ranking her 21st among Senate candidates. Our ruling Shaheen’s ad said that in 2012, ""Wall Street"" gave Scott Brown ""more campaign contributions than any other candidate -- $5.3 million."" If you put together six categories that might reasonably be considered ""Wall Street,"" Brown received about $4.2 million in all, and he finished first among Senate candidates in four of those six categories. However, the total amount is short of the $5.3 million claimed in the ad. The statement is generally accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/sep/19/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shaheen-says-wall-street-gave-scott-brown-m/

Tom Cotton incorrectly says Obama turned farm bill into food stamps bill
","Back in January, Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., took some heat for voting against the final version of the farm bill -- particularly being the only lawmaker from Arkansas, a state that depends on farming, to do so. Now, the Republican Senate candidate is out with an ad to defend his vote, arguing that it was the fiscally responsible course. The 30-second spot features Cotton and his father on their family farm. Cotton says his dad taught him financial lessons that he carried into his current role. ""(My dad) taught me early: farmers can’t spend more than they take in, and I listened,"" Cotton said in the ad. ""When President Obama hijacked the farm bill, turned it into a food stamp bill, with billions more in spending, I voted no."" Cotton, who is running against incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor, goes on to say that the farm bill was a case of politicians taking a bad idea (food stamps) and attaching it to a good one (the farm bill). Is this true? Is Obama really to blame? We took a closer look. A brief history Food assistance legislation has been tied to agriculture for decades. Congress passed the first farm bill in 1933, during the Great Depression and Dust Bowl, to aid farmers struggling with low commodity prices and dry soil in the Midwest. To fight poverty in the general population, the bill also established a nutritional assistance program. The program took surplus crops, meat and dairy products and distributed them to people in need. The program became known as ""food stamps"" in 1939, overseen by the Agriculture Department, according to SNAP to Health, an organization that aims to improve health among food purchasing assistance recipients. This program ended in 1943 but was reinstated nationally in 1964 as the Food Stamp Act, part of President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society program to address poverty. In this iteration, food stamp policy was not addressed in farm bills, but the Agriculture Secretary administered the program. The farm bill and food stamps merged once again in 1973. Representatives from urban areas and those from rural areas figured this pairing would aid the bill in securing broad support in Congress, according to an article by New York University law professor John Ferejohn. Since then, a program -- currently called SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program -- has been part of every farm bill that has become law, according to a December 2013 Congressional Research Service report. Today, a farm bill is passed about every five years, reauthorizing food and agriculture policy, including measures such as crop and commodity subsidies, conservation programs, agriculture research and food stamps. In 2013, the House -- led by Republicans, Cotton included -- became the first chamber to pass a farm bill that didn’t include food stamps. But that bill wasn’t able to pass the Senate, and the final farm bill that became law in February 2014 did include food stamps. So how does this history illuminate the accuracy of Cotton’s claim? Obama did support passing a farm bill that included food stamps in 2013, with the White House releasing an extensive report in November 2013, titled, ""The Economic Importance of Passing a Comprehensive Food, Farm and Jobs Bill."" But the idea of merging the two topics together in one bill hardly came from Obama. It had been that way, uninterrupted, since 1973 -- when Obama wasn’t even a teenager yet. And while the number of food stamp recipients grew dramatically in the wake of the last recession, which bottomed out around the time Obama took office, food stamps have accounted for a majority of farm bill spending for more than a decade. The bill passed in 2014 has a nearly $1 trillion price tag over 10 years, and 80 percent of that goes toward nutrition assistance. In the 2008 version of the bill, 67 percent of spending was devoted to nutrition assistance. In the 2002 bill, about 55 percent of spending went to nutritional assistance. Our ruling Cotton said that Obama ""hijacked the farm bill (and) turned it into a food stamp bill."" That’s not correct -- food stamps have been part of every farm bill enacted since 1973. One could say that Cotton and his allies in the House, by seeking a farm bill stripped of food stamp provisions, were actually the ones taking a more radical step, one that Congress ultimately voted against. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2014/sep/19/tom-cotton/tom-cotton-incorrectly-says-obama-turned-farm-bill/

InfoWars: U.S. ordering 160,000 Hazmat suits, sign that Ebola is about to spread
","As Ebola continues to spread in Africa, the United States has committed over $100 million in aid, in the form of both supplies and personnel. But fringe voices on the Web are suggesting that Ebola is even a bigger threat than the U.S. government is letting on. The conspiracy website InfoWars reported this week that ""the U.S. State Department has ordered 160,000 Hazmat suits for Ebola, prompting concerns that the federal government is anticipating the rapid spread of a virus that has already claimed an unprecedented number of lives."" The InfoWars report cites a press release from Lakeland Industries, which manufactures protective clothing, and the InfoWars report says that ""only 1,400 federal workers are currently in the region (western Africa), suggesting that the 160,000 figure is far higher than what would be required merely for sending medical workers abroad."" From there, InfoWars cites a German virologist to the effect that Ebola’s death toll will climb to 5 million (the Ebola outbreak has claimed 2,630 deaths at time of writing), and suggests that ""Ebola could have gone airborne to at least a limited extent."" (We found plenty of other examples of the Hazmat story floating around the Internet.) We’re not going to touch speculation about Ebola’s evolution, but we wanted to check his claim that the State Department has ordered 160,000 Hazmat suits for Ebola, and that their order reflects the federal government’s anticipation of a ""rapid spread"" of Ebola. The press release The Lakeland press release, which announces its increased ""manufacturing capacity"" for the ""specialty protective suits to be worn by health care workers and others being exposed to Ebola,"" only has a sentence relating to the State Department’s order. ""With the U.S. State Department alone putting out a bid for 160,000 suits,"" they say, ""we encourage all protective apparel companies to increase their manufacturing capacity for sealed seam garments so that our industry can do its part in addressing this threat to global health."" That’s not much to go on, but there’s a crucial distinction that InfoWars glosses over: The press release mentions a bid, not an ""order."" That means that while a purchase of 160,000 suits may be in the works, it’s not final yet and may not even happen. U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) spokesman Matt Herrick said that he couldn’t ""speak to specific procurement that is in process and not awarded,"" but confirmed that the Lakeland press release ""is in reference to USAID and our ongoing efforts to secure personal protective equipment to combat the spread of Ebola."" The bid InfoWars is referring to comes from USAID, which is technically independent of the State Department. The two organizations, though, work closely together. USAID USAID has been providing protective equipment to partners in Africa since March, Herrick said. That includes Hazmat suits like the ChemMax 1 suit referred to in Lakeland’s press release. The suit, while not Ebola-exclusive, is designed to protect against infectious agents. Beyond the suits, USAID’s assistance to African organizations has come in the form of disease-control experts, funding and a variety of emergency supplies. Herrick referred us to this series of press releases on USAID’s efforts. ""Last month, USAID airlifted more than 16 tons of medical supplies and emergency equipment to Liberia,"" Herrick said, including 10,000 Hazmat suits, water treatment units, and plastic sheeting to create Ebola treatment units. That might seem like a lot of suits, but ""the equipment set is designed to be worn just once and then disposed of once treatment is administered,"" said Herrick. ""So many sets are needed for each health provider."" ""USAID has procured and delivered more than 100,000 suits to date, and we are on track to procure and deliver more than 130,000 additional suits,"" Herrick said. ""The equipment is provided to local health care workers and nongovernmental partners working in the affected countries."" Herrick wouldn’t elaborate on how the suits from the bid related to USAID’s plans, but the figures he gave are crucial context. The 160,000 suits aren’t actually ""far higher than what would be required merely for sending medical workers abroad,"" as InfoWars claimed. USAID has provided almost that many suits already, and there seems to be an immediate need for more. This information is also public via USAID’s press releases, so it's not as though they’re privately predicting a ""rapid spread"" of Ebola beyond the scope of the current outbreak. Our ruling The website InfoWars claimed that the State Department ""has ordered 160,000 Hazmat suits for Ebola,"" demonstrating that ""the federal government is anticipating the rapid spread of a virus that has already claimed an unprecedented number of lives."" The federal government agency in question is USAID, but that’s something of a technicality. A USAID official told us that the suits are one use only, so 160,000 suits aren’t actually an astronomical amount. In fact, USAID has already delivered 100,000 suits to the Ebola-infected regions of Africa. Their new bid, while an expansion of their efforts, is in line with what USAID has done so far, and doesn’t demonstrate that the federal government is anticipating any sort of ""rapid spread.""

Unconfirmed: National Guard troops forced to contact food bank to feed themselves
","Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, suggested National Guard troops dispatched to the Texas-Mexico border by Gov. Rick Perry were reduced to asking for food assistance while fulfilling their duties. According to a Texas Tribune news story posted online Aug. 29, 2014, Van de Putte, a San Antonio state senator and chairwoman of the Senate Veteran Affairs and Military Installations Committee, said: ""Today, we learn that our men and women of the Guard have been forced to contact food banks to feed themselves because they haven’t been paid in weeks. This is unacceptable."" And had Guard members placed along the border contacted food banks to fill their bellies? By email, Van de Putte campaign spokesman Manny Garcia said the senator made her statement in an Aug. 29, 2014, press release based on news stories including an account published that day by the San Antonio Express-News. By email, he provided web links to news reports including an initial Aug. 28, 2014, report by KGBT-TV in Harlingen quoting Terri Drefke, chief executive officer of the Food Bank of the Rio Grande Valley, saying: ""We were contacted that 50 troops that are in the Valley don't have any money for food and gas and they need our assistance."" The Express-News story said the Texas National Guard had just contacted the food bank to ask whether the charity had food and gas resources for about 50 soldiers in need of assistance because they hadn’t yet received a paycheck. Then again, the story said that, according to Omar Rodriguez, a food bank spokesman, it was unclear how many soldiers had used the food bank because its clients aren’t asked to say where they work. Separately, Texas Army National Guard Brig. Gen. Patrick Hamilton said no troops had visited the food bank to his knowledge, the newspaper reported. ""We identified 50 soldiers who came on at the very end of the first pay period who would see a three-week lag in income,"" Hamilton said, adding that the Guard support service officer who called the food bank was ""trying to help"" but did so outside a chain of command. The same day, the Guard issued a statement indicating two previously unemployed Guard members involved in the border deployment had indicated they were needy; the statement did not say either went to a food bank. But broadly, the Guard said, all ""members supporting the operation"" near the border ""are furnished with lodging, meals, transportation and the equipment required to perform their mission. Service members supporting this operation receive pay, allowance for housing and per diem for meals on the normal state payroll schedule."" The statement further said: ""Media reports indicate some members of the Texas National Guard supporting this new operation were in need of resources, including food and gas. It is important to note, the Texas National Guard offers robust services to its service members and their families who identify a need, including temporary financial assistance, resilience training and counseling, family readiness and reintegration activities."" The statement went on: ""As a result of inquiries for assistance by service members deploying to the Rio Grande Valley, the Texas National Guard Family Assistance Coordinator identified a variety of options for service members who may have existing financial hardships, including inquiries to local food banks among other organizations. The agency specifically had two previously unemployed service members who requested support. Both of those soldiers were provided assistance."" It doesn't look like the described assistance involved stopping by a food bank. An Austin American-Statesman news story posted that afternoon quoted Lt. Col. Joanne MacGregor, a spokeswoman for the Texas National Guard, saying its officials had no indication any Guardsmen had received assistance from the food bank. In response to our follow-up inquiry, MacGregor said there had been no change in this respect; the Guard was ""not aware of any service members utilizing the food banks,"" she emailed. According to the Guard, troops receive one meal while on duty, plus a $32 per diem food reimbursement included in their paychecks. We reached Rodriguez, the spokesman for the Pharr-based food bank, who told us by phone the bank still hadn't noticed Guard members coming in for food. ""As far as actual members coming in for food assistance, we have not seen any,"" Rodriguez said, though (again) he cautioned that no one who seeks such assistance is asked where he or she works. We circled back to Garcia, who said by email the senator stands by her statement. Our ruling Van de Putte said: ""Our men and women of the Guard have been forced to contact food banks to feed themselves."" No one has confirmed any troops contacting food banks to feed themselves. What happened: A National Guard functionary took the precautionary step of asking a border-area food bank about troops yet to be paid possibly receiving groceries if necessary. The food bank said it could provide. We rate this statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Would billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer profit if Keystone Pipeline was killed?
","It’s Republican strategist Karl Rove versus billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer in Iowa. Rove’s group, American Crossroads, is up with a new ad that claims the Democratic Senate candidate there, Rep. Bruce Braley, is doing the bidding for Steyer by voting against the Keystone XL oil pipeline. ""Now, a California billionaire who stands to profit by blocking Keystone is spending big to help Braley’s campaign,"" the ad says. ""Bruce Braley, he’s on the side of billionaire special interests, not Iowa workers."" Steyer is identified in the ad as the California billionaire. He has run ads helping Braley and against his opponent, Republican Joni Ernst. Rove’s group is a super PAC backed by millions of dollars in undisclosed donors, so American Crossroads warning voters about ""special interest"" dollars in the race sounds a little to us like, ""Pot, meet kettle."" But regardless, we wanted to review American Crossroads' attack against Steyer. Would he ""stand to profit"" if Keystone is killed? We reviewed the evidence. For those unfamiliar with Steyer, he’s the billionaire behind NextGen Climate Change who has promised $100 million to Democrats in the midterm elections. Some have called him the Democrats’ Koch brothers of the election cycle. How, exactly, would an environmentalist make money by blocking Keystone XL, a pipeline that would carry oil from the Alberta tar sands through Nebraska to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico? American Crossroads sent us quite a few news stories that showed Steyer wasn’t always the hardcore environmentalist he now portrays himself as. Steyer made his fortune at Farallon Capital Management, an investment group he started in the 1980s. According to a Washington Post profile and other reports, Farallon Capital heavily invested in energy throughout Steyer’s time there, including fossil fuels. Steyer left the company in the fall of 2012. ""Investments included BP and mining companies in the United States and around the world,"" the Post wrote. ""Farallon's second-largest holding in September 2012, a month before Steyer announced his departure, was a $220 million investment in the oil-and-gas giant Nexen."" Also included in Farallon’s investment portfolio was Kinder Morgan, a company that owned a pipeline connecting the Alberta tar sands to the Pacific coast. The pipeline is considered a rival to Keystone XL. So case closed, right? Not so fast. As we said, Steyer left Farallon Capital in 2012. But it wasn’t just that he left, it’s how he left. When he stepped down as a co-managing partner, Steyer directed Farallon Capital to divest his investments in the company from any of its holdings in tar sands and coal. That would have included the Kinder Morgan pipeline. Later in 2013, Steyer called for the company to divest his money from fossil fuels entirely. A spokeswoman for Steyer told the Post in June that process would conclude that month. Around the same time, Steyer took heat from Republicans for investing in an energy source he was simultaneously vilifying. In response, Steyer vowed to donate all the profits he made from Kinder Morgan pipeline to a charity. He announced in June he was donating $2 million to that cause. We don’t know if that was the full amount of the profit Steyer earned from his investment in the rival pipeline. But the ad from American Crossroads is prospective anyway, claiming that Steyer ""stands to profit"" from blocking Keystone. Steyer no longer has any way to directly earn money from the Kinder Morgan pipeline. And here’s the kicker: As of today, Farallon Capital Management no longer has any investment holdings in Kinder Morgan. Security and Exchange Commission filings for Farallon show $45 million worth of investments in Kinder Morgan through the end of 2013. But Kinder Morgan does not show up on the investment group’s portfolio for the first or second quarter of 2014. Our ruling American Crossroads said Steyer ""stands to profit by blocking Keystone"" and ""is spending big to help"" Braley’s Senate campaign. At one point, this might have been an accurate ad. Steyer’s former hedge fund, Farallon Capital Management, had significant holdings in a company that owned a pipeline considered a rival to Keystone XL, and under Steyer’s direction, his investment group had a large stake in fossil fuels. However, Steyer has since left the investment group he started, and asked his company to divest any of his holdings from fossil fuels, including tar sands. He also donated his profits from the Kinder Morgan pipeline to charity. Further, as of 2014, Farallon is no longer invested in Keystone’s competitor, according to SEC filings. As far as we can tell, Steyer would not directly profit from Keystone’s demise going forward. So the evidence from American Crossroads falls short. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/sep/19/american-crossroads/would-billionaire-environmentalist-tom-steyer-prof/

Scott Walker's jobs agency gives incentives that lead to loss of jobs, rival Mary Burke says
","The Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., a jobs agency created by Republican Gov. Scott Walker and a GOP-controlled Legislature, has been beset by enough operational problems that it has become something of a political punching bag. But Democrat Mary Burke took the criticism to a new level when she raised questions about whether the agency is actually costing the state jobs. The former state Department of Commerce secretary and Trek Bicycle executive was asked in a Sept. 10, 2014 interview on La Crosse television what she would do to keep Wisconsin from losing jobs to other countries. ""It’s absolutely critical,"" Burke said. ""And, unfortunately, we have a situation not only in the state here but across the country where American manufacturers are finding it hard to compete against lower-wage countries. So, as governor, I want to fight for the interests of Wisconsin manufacturers, to level that playing field. She continued: ""But also, we shouldn't have incentives that cause Wisconsin companies to look at actually shipping jobs elsewhere. And there was a company that, just yesterday it was just announced that under WEDC -- the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., Gov. Walker's chief jobs agency -- that a company got $4.6 million in taxpayer money and actually reduced its jobs by 300 people. So, we have to make sure we’re not having incentives that actually cause employers to ship jobs elsewhere."" So, does the WEDC offer incentives that lead companies to move jobs out of Wisconsin? WEDC’s history WEDC was created in February 2011 to replace the Department of Commerce. Walker argued that the partially privatized agency would be able to respond more quickly to the needs of businesses looking to create jobs in the state. Its short history has included controversy. In November 2012, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that WEDC discovered it had failed to track in one centralized database more than $12 million in past-due loans. In May 2013, a state audit found the agency repeatedly failed to follow basic standards in state law for ensuring the clear and proper use of millions of dollars in taxpayer money. And in September 2014, it was revealed that a top WEDC official quit the previous month over the way the agency is run, saying another leader — and former top aide to Walker — was causing the agency ""lasting harm."" He revoked his resignation three days later. Burke’s claim As for Burke’s claim, her campaign spokesman insisted that Burke did not mean to say WEDC offers incentives that lead Wisconsin businesses to move jobs out of state. But twice in her remarks Burke referred to incentives that could cause businesses to ship jobs elsewhere. So, we're basing our factcheck on what a TV viewer would have heard Burke say. The day before Burke’s interview, WKOW-TV in Madison did a blog post following up on previous news stories it had aired about WEDC assistance to Plexus Corp., a company based in Neenah in Wisconsin’s Fox Valley that also has operations in Europe and Asia. The piece noted that Plexus had received $4.6 million in tax credits from WEDC despite having cut more than 300 jobs. Those were the two figures Burke cited in the La Crosse interview and her campaign confirmed that she was referring to Plexus. Let’s explain. Plexus builds electronics  for other companies., such as ultrasound machines for GE Medical Systems and the ""Freestyle"" soda-dispensing machine for Coca-Cola. In May 2012, it announced plans to build a $50 million, 410,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Neenah to replace two leased plants. At the time, Plexus and WEDC said the agency was eligible for up to $15 million in tax credits for the plant. Walker said as many as 350 jobs could eventually be created. WEDC provides certain portions of the tax credits based primarily on the amount of money Plexus invests in the now-completed plant, which was dedicated in August 2014, and on the number of jobs added over time. Plexus was to retain 1,792 jobs and create 350 more. According to the latest data on WEDC’s database, as of December 2013 only 1,485 jobs were retained -- 307 fewer than planned -- and no new jobs were created. About $4.6 million of the $15 million in credits that were approved had been issued. The tax credit deal runs through 2019. In July 2014, WKOW reported that Plexus said in July 2012, a month after the $15 million in credits were announced, it was laying off 116 workers from its main facility in Neenah. Plexus later issued a statement saying it did the Wisconsin layoffs after unexpectedly losing its largest global customer. The jobs were simply lost as a result of the lost business and were not moved elsewhere, the company said. The affected Plexus employees received federal benefits for workers harmed by overseas trade because the competitor that picked up the contract ended up performing the work in Mexico. A July 2014 memo from WEDC says Plexus will need to rehire for the positions that were cut before receiving any of the tax credits for adding jobs. Most of the new jobs are expected to be added in 2015 and 2016, according to the memo. Our rating Burke said the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., Walker's chief jobs agency, gives financial incentives that lead ""Wisconsin companies to look at shipping jobs elsewhere. ... A company got $4.6 million in taxpayer money and actually reduced its jobs by 300 people."" There is an element of truth in the statement, in that Plexus Corp.'s Wisconsin employment dropped by 300 after it received about $4.6 million in state tax credits. Burke could criticize WEDC for giving money to a company that soon after laid off Wisconsin employees, but there is no evidence the aid led the company to move jobs elsewhere. Indeed, the aid went toward building a new plant in Wisconsin. Our rating is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/sep/19/mary-burke/scott-walkers-jobs-agency-gives-incentives-lead-lo/

Nunn invitation exaggerates her youth in Georgia
","Readers of a certain age will remember Bill Clinton accepting the Democratic nomination for president in 1992 by invoking the name of the small southern town where he lived as a young boy. The two-time president spent seven years in Hope, Ark., first while his mother finished nursing school and then briefly after she returned. ""I still believe in a place called Hope,"" Clinton famously said, explaining the small town’s lessons of equality and aspiration. Clinton was in Atlanta last week, at the home of R&B singer Usher, to raise money for Democrat Michelle Nunn’s U.S. Senate bid. Both Nunn and her Republican opponent, David Perdue, are trying to burnish their Georgia credentials, no easy task since both have spent major portions of their lives out of state. The  invitation to the Usher event invoked a small middle Georgia town to tell Nunn’s story. ""Daughter of Sam and Colleen Nunn,"" the bio section read, ""Michelle was born in 1966 in Macon, near her grandparents’ farm in Perry, Ga., where she spent most of her childhood."" An alert reader pointed out the ""most of her childhood"" claim, certain Nunn herself had acknowledged her family moved away when her father was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972. She was 6 at the time. Nunn declined to talk to PolitiFact Georgia about the claim. But she has talked with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and national media about her childhood plenty, even before announcing her candidacy. In several AJC stories, including a 1992 Father’s Day piece, Nunn says she grew up in the Washington, D.C. area. A January, 2014 New York Times story describes her as quipping that she moved ""against my will,"" when she was 6 and her family relocated to Maryland. The same article notes Nunn lived in the Capital region during high school, when she played basketball at the all-girls National Cathedral School. Those reports are accurate, said Nunn spokesman Nathan Click. So is the biography listed on her official campaign website, which notes only that she was born near the family’s Perry farm, he said. ""While the bio that appears on the campaign's website and is widely utilized by the campaign correctly characterizes Michelle's biographical facts, a separate document that appeared on some event invitations failed to properly do so,"" Click said in a statement. Even though the fundraiser was the most high-profile to date in Nunn’s race against Republican businessman Perdue, that might be the end of it: a bio not properly vetted before publication. But another Nunn misstep, the leak of confidential campaign strategy memos this summer, brings up another point. The memos point out that Nunn should anticipate certain attacks, among them that she is ""not a ‘real’ Georgian."" Candidates, and voters, move in and out of the state all the time, so it’s unclear how much of a negative that would really be, said Kerwin Swint, chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. Perdue, for instance, has a television ad airing outside of metro Atlanta, that says he ""grew up working his family’s farm in middle Georgia. "" The spot  doesn’t mention that the 64-year-old spent much of his working life outside the state, in places such as Massachusetts, Tennessee and Hong Kong. But the leaked memos could open up Nunn to attack for being disingenuous, Swint said. ""Newt Gingrich is from Pennsylvania for heaven’s sake,"" he said. ""Ordinarily it wouldn’t be that big of a story, but it is because of the intense publicity from the leak."" Leslie Shedd, spokeswoman for the division of the Georgia GOP known as Georgia Victory, said the issue is not where Nunn grew up but why any biography would counter already-published facts. ""To me, it’s not an issue that she didn’t spend her entire life in Georgia,"" Shedd said. ""Why does she feel the need to essentially lie about it?"" Based on the explanation from the Nunn camp, and the ease to find biographical information on her, Swint said it appears the bio was an inadvertent, not intentional mistake. Click described Nunn as a ninth-generation Georgian, who kept ties to Perry by spending holidays and summers at the family farm. Nunn herself, in the New York Times piece, said her father constantly reminded her that she was ""from Georgia."" Nunn has lived in Atlanta since 1989, after graduating from the University of Virginia at 23. Childhood, by any reasonable definition, ends at least at age 18. And the facts are clear: Nunn spent 12 of those years living outside of Georgia. Even accounting for summer vacations and holidays, any claim that she spent ""most"" of her childhood here is inconsistent with the facts. Nunn’s campaign admits it made a mistake with its statement, and there are multiple instances of her acknowledging her move from Georgia. Nunn did spend part of her childhood in Georgia, but certainly not most of it.
