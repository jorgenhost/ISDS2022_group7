List does not show over 14,000 dead people cast ballots in Michigan’s Wayne County
","A viral tweet claims that thousands of dead Wayne County voters cast ballots in this election. ""Here is a list of 14+ thousand dead people who voted in Wayne County (Detroit),"" the tweet says, linking to a list that provides the first and last names of just over 14,500 individuals and their birth year. This tweet marks the latest in a long line of false claims that individuals fraudulently cast mail-in ballots on behalf of dead voters. All of the voters listed are over the age of 100, but they’re not all Wayne County residents, and at least several of the voters named on the list are not marked in the state’s voter information center as ever having received or cast an absentee ballot. And at least one woman listed seems to still be alive. According to the state’s voter information center, one voter, Imo Oliver of Ypsilanti, included on the list of allegedly dead voters cast an absentee ballot this year. The state’s voter information center shows that Oliver received her absentee ballot Sept. 24, and it was returned to the clerk’s office Oct. 2. PolitiFact Michigan used public records to identify the Ypsilanti voter, and spoke to a woman who identified herself as Imo Oliver. She was an elderly woman who said she suffered from memory loss, but she said her son assisted her to vote in this election. Some may be dead, but there’s no evidence that the state counted any ballots cast by deceased voters. Others may be old, but there’s no law establishing an age limit on voting. Michigan is a member of the Electronic Registration Information Center, a multi-state partnership that offers access to federal databases and technology to ensure the integrity of voter files. The system relies on Social Security Administration death records to flag deceased voters. The state also checks to ensure that ballots cast by people who are deceased are not counted. In the August primary, the state successfully identified ballots cast by 846 people who had passed away between casting their ballot and the election.  ""Ballots of voters who have died are rejected in Michigan, even if the voter cast an absentee ballot and then died before Election Day,"" the Secretary of State’s Office noted on its fact-check page. Sometimes clerical errors occur when recording ballots received by voters with similar names. The Secretary of State’s fact-check notes, ""On rare occasions, a ballot received for a living voter may be recorded in a way that makes it appear as if the voter is dead."" One viral example from this week concerned a son and his late father, who shared the same name and home address. A screenshot from the voter information center showed the elder Bradley as having cast a mail ballot in the 2020 election, even though he died in 1984. PolitiFact investigated and learned this was a mistake, not voter fraud. The city clerk’s office initially recorded the younger ballot as belonging to the deceased father, a consultant for the Detroit Department of Elections told PolitiFact.  The New York Times reported that ""internet sleuths have widely disseminated what they said was evidence that showed Democrats were trying to steal the election. In virtually every case so far, mainstream journalists have found the claims to be false or the product of typical errors in the election process."" Despite widespread claims that dead voters cast ballots in Detroit, Michigan, Virginia, Nevada and Wisconsin, none stack up. This one doesn’t either. A tweet claims that this election, over 14,000 dead people in Wayne County voted. There is no evidence to support this claim. While the list contains the names of over 14,000 individuals, they are not all Wayne County residents. Several of the individuals did not receive or cast an absentee ballot. At least one woman listed seems to still be alive. There is no evidence that Michigan clerks counted ballots fraudulently cast on behalf of dead people. We rate it False.

Fact-checking Republican claim of illegal votes in Nevada
","President Donald Trump’s campaign and Republicans in Nevada are questioning the integrity of the 2020 election, claiming that there ""appear"" to be thousands of people who voted illegally. ""Our lawyers just sent a criminal referral to (U.S. Attorney General Bill) Barr regarding at least 3,062 instances of voter fraud,"" the Nevada Republican Party tweeted Nov. 5. ""We expect that number to grow substantially. Thousands of individuals have been identified who appear to have violated the law by casting ballots after they moved from NV."" ""In Nevada, there appear to be thousands of individuals who improperly cast mail ballots,"" Matt Morgan, general counsel for Trump’s reelection campaign, similarly said in a statement Nov. 6. PolitiFact reached out to Trump’s campaign, a law office representing the campaign, and to the Nevada Republican Party seeking information. We did not hear back. At this point, the claims are unproven. A lawsuit filed Nov. 5 against Nevada’s secretary of state and the Clark County registrar of voters alleges that ""irregularities have plagued the election in Clark County."" Clark County is Nevada’s most populous county, is home to Las Vegas and has the state’s highest number of registered Democrats. The lawsuit claims that there were ""over 3,000 instances of ineligible individuals casting ballots,"" and that ballots were cast on behalf of deceased voters. It does not include evidence to back those claims. The lawsuit, which challenges the county’s use of a machine as a step in signature verification, was filed on behalf of a Nevada resident, candidate committees for two Republicans running for Congress, and another person identified as a credentialed member of the media. ""We are not aware of any improper ballots that are being processed,"" Clark County Registrar of Voters Joe Gloria said during a press conference Nov. 5. Lawyers for Trump’s campaign sent a letter to Clark County’s counsel, saying, ""We have confirmed that thousands of votes have been cast improperly. Indeed, we have initially identified 3,062 voters who moved from Nevada before the election but still cast ballots in this election."" The lawyers said they cross-referenced the list of general election voters with publicly available change of address records. The attorneys sent a similar letter to Barr, the U.S. attorney general. However, a mismatch in those records doesn’t necessarily mean that a vote was cast illegally. The ACLU of Nevada said that an American who moved within 30 days before an election has a right to vote in a presidential race in their new state of residence, or may cast a ballot in their previous state of residence, in-person or via absentee ballot. A spokesperson for Nevada Secretary of State Barbara K. Cegavske, a Republican, told PolitiFact that the ACLU statement is accurate and also applies to Nevada. Trump’s lawyers produced a list of voters who allegedly voted improperly. But Jon Ralston, editor of The Nevada Independent, a nonprofit news organization, noted in a Nov. 6 tweet that the list includes Nevadans in the military who voted absentee. ""Many on list sent to the DOJ have these postal codes: AE, AA and AP: Armed Forces Europe, Armed Forces Americas and Armed Forces Pacific,"" Ralston said. The list does not include voters’ names, but does show other identifying information. It includes the city, state, and zip code where one voter moved from, and the city, state, and zip code where the voter moved. For instance, the first page of the list says that ""vote cast record 28"" moved from Las Vegas, Nev., and lists as the new city ""FPO"" and as the new state ""AE."" The Defense Department says that ""FPO"" stands for Fleet Post Office, and is associated with Navy installations and ships. The U.S. Postal Service says that ""AE"" should be used as the ""state"" abbreviation for Armed Forces in Europe. Nevadans who go to college out-of-state and other people who leave the state temporarily can also get a ballot at a new address. So the list produced by Trump’s lawyers on its own does not prove whether the identified people cast a vote illegally. Nevada Republicans said they found ""at least 3,062 instances of voter fraud. ... Thousands of individuals have been identified who appear to have violated the law by casting ballots after they moved from NV."" The GOP lawyers issued a list that they say shows more than 3,000 people who were no longer living in Clark County by the time they cast their ballots. The list alone does not prove a violation of the law. People who move within 30 days before an election can cast a vote in their new state, or in their prior state of residence, in-person or via absentee ballot. A Nevadan who goes to another state for college can also request a ballot. The list from Trump’s lawyers also included addresses for Americans serving overseas in the military. The burden of proof is on the speaker making the claim. The information released so far by Trump’s team does not confirm their claim. We rate the claim False.

Ted Cruz falsely claims Philadelphia is counting votes in ‘shroud of darkness’
","Sen. Ted Cruz amplified President Donald Trump’s baseless and conspiratorial claims of a stolen election, falsely claiming that Philadelphia officials have been kicking out Republican election observers and counting legally cast ballots ""in a shroud of darkness."" ""I am angry, and I think the American people are angry,"" Cruz said in a Nov. 5 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. ""Because, by throwing the observers out, by clouding the vote counting in a shroud of darkness, they are setting the stage to potentially steal an election.""  There is no evidence at this point that any significant number of illegal votes have been cast, and neither Trump nor Cruz have provided any proof of wrongdoing.  The Texas senator’s claim about votes being counted ""in a shroud of darkness"" is also wrong. Observers from both political parties have had access to the process in Philadelphia and in Pennsylvania more broadly. Philadelphia’s counting setup also includes a livestream. Hours before Cruz appeared on Fox News, Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar told CNN’s Jake Tapper there was ""absolutely"" nothing happening in the dark. ""In Pennsylvania, every candidate and every political party is allowed to have an authorized representative in the room observing the process,"" Boockvar said, adding that the livestream in Philadelphia is available worldwide. ""It’s very transparent."" Hours after Cruz’s comments, Philadelphia City Commissioner Al Schmidt, a Republican, also appeared on CNN. ""Observers from the Democratic Party and Republican Party, from the Biden campaign and the Trump campaign, have been in our counting area observing, right up against where the process is taking place, from the very beginning,"" he told CNN’s Don Lemon. A Cruz spokesperson said Republican observers have been ""denied meaningful access to the ballot processing and counting process in Philadelphia,"" citing a recent judge’s order allowing observers from both parties to watch the process from within six feet. Observers had previously been kept farther away due to concerns about the coronavirus.  Election workers scan in ballots at the Pennsylvania Convention Center on Nov. 3, 2020, in Philadelphia. (AP) The city has appealed the judge’s order, saying they have provided access that is in step with the law and accounts for the pandemic. But it has complied in the meantime. Cruz has argued on Twitter that the previous distance was too far.  He wrote that observers were so far away that they ""had to use binoculars"" — something the Philadelphia Inquirer photographed one election observer doing on Nov. 3. But Cruz’s claim that Philadelphia is cloaking the process in secrecy is far from accurate.  ""At all times, the city commissioners, who are a bipartisan organization, have followed the law,"" said Kevin Feeley, a spokesperson for the city commissioners. City solicitor Marcel Pratt told the Philadelphia Inquirer that a location has been set up so observers ""can easily view the room without impeding the operation,"" and the city wrote in its court appeal that representatives from both parties could ""see the entire set up"" in detail. The same day Cruz spoke to Hannity, a Trump campaign lawyer told a federal judge in court that the campaign had several representatives in the room, according to news reports.  In an effort to halt the vote count, the Trump campaign cited testimony from one observer who said he could not tell whether there were any errant markings on ballot secrecy envelopes. But a judge denied the bid and suggested an agreement be reached for the number of observers. Pennsylvania commonwealth law allows election observers. Feeley noted that Act 77, the law that established mail-in voting and allows observers to be present when mail ballots are opened and recorded, was passed by a Republican legislature. ""Any laws around poll watchers apply equally to both major parties and any third parties,"" said Suzanne Almeida, interim executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania. ""I have seen no evidence that one party’s poll watchers have been treated any differently than the other."" The city’s livestream, which has been running since Election Day, also provides viewing access to the general public. Wired reported that watching the livestream closely ""reveals almost every step of how a ballot becomes a vote.""  Cruz’s office did not respond by deadline to a question asking for examples of Republican observers being kicked out of the convention center. In another Nov. 5 tweet, Cruz shared a video of a man accusing Philadelphia officials of preventing him from observing. But Buzzfeed News reported that the man was not wrongfully prevented as Democrats were ""defying the law,"" as Cruz claimed. He was removed for breaking the rules against filming. ""Security there asked him to stop, and he refused,"" Feeley said. Feeley said he has been present for the ballot counting each day since the election, and that he knows of no other observer who was told to leave. ""I’m staring at them now,"" Feeley said. ""Claims regarding election observers being wrongly removed from the convention center are demonstrably untrue,"" added Jane Roh, a spokesperson for the Philadelphia district attorney. In an isolated mixup, one poll watcher was denied on Election Day from watching the voting process — not the ballot-counting process — but Feeley told PolitiFact at the time that the person was allowed in at another polling site and had been denied by mistake. Cruz said Philadelphia is ""clouding the vote counting in a shroud of darkness."" That’s not the case. A judge ruled to let election observers watch the count from closer up, but representatives from both parties have been allowed to observe the process all along. The counting is also being streamed live online. We rate Cruz’s statement False.

Donald Trump’s Pants on Fire claim about illegal votes
","As vote counting continued, President Donald Trump offered a fresh round of falsehoods and wrongly suggested illegal votes are swinging the election toward Joe Biden.  ""If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us,"" Trump said Nov. 5. We asked Trump spokespersons which votes he considered ""illegal"" and did not hear back. However, the rest of Trump’s remarks show that he questioned the timing of mail ballot arrivals and the counting in certain battleground states.  As Trump continues to perpetuate a myth about widespread voter fraud, he hasn’t proved that illegal votes influenced the election.  ""So far we have seen no credible evidence of illegal votes in any state that could potentially tip the results of the election to Trump,"" UC Irvine law professor Rick Hasen said Nov. 6. ""Assuming Biden wins Pennsylvania, I see no path for Trump to litigate his way to victory based upon unsubstantiated claims of fraud.""  The idea that Democrats would orchestrate a nationwide felonious scheme to count illegal votes would require voters and election workers in various counties (Democrats and Republicans) to coordinate and take actions that risk prison time. And it defies logic that such a scheme would take place that would aim to keep Trump out of the White House but have Republicans win seats in the House and potentially retain control of the Senate. Republicans govern some of the states Trump has challenged vote counting. Nevada has a Republican secretary of state. Georgia has a Republican secretary of state and governor. Arizona has a Republican governor. The regular counting of legal ballots continued at the time of Trump’s remarks in a handful of battleground states. Trump has targeted ""late"" ballots, but that’s inaccurate. State laws specify when mail ballots must be postmarked or arrive in order to be counted, and the grace period (if there is one) varies by state. States also vary in their policies on how early election officials can start processing mail ballots.  Election officials have been following the processes in their state laws to verify and tabulate ballots. They have been rejecting ballots that violated state laws, such as omitting the signature on the envelope or sending it in past the state’s deadline, and only counting ballots that are legal, said David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research. Many states give voters time to correct signature issues. There are policies, too, across many states allowing political parties or others to deploy observers to watch the ballot verification and counting. Who can observe and what they can watch (and especially in the pandemic, how many can be in the room) can vary by state, but the underlying principle is transparency. Steven Huefner, an election law expert at Ohio State University, said questionable ballots are set aside and not counted as they await an official review. ""Might an election official make a mistake and count a ballot that should not have been counted? Sure. Is there any evidence that has happened this election? Not that I have seen,"" Huefner said. Trump and his allies have filed lawsuits in an effort to challenge vote counting and other procedures in states with close races. Judges have thrown out lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign in Michigan and Georgia. In Pennsylvania, a federal judge denied a request to halt ballot counting in Philadelphia. Pennsylvania Republicans filed an emergency U.S. Supreme Court request related to the arrival of mail ballots.  Litigation remains pending targeting Clark County in Nevada, the most populous county in the state with the highest number of Democrats and home to Las Vegas.  The lawsuit alleged that in Clark County there were ""over 3,000 instances of ineligible individuals casting ballots. Ballots have even been cast on behalf of deceased voters."" The Nevada Republican Party sent information to the U.S. Department of Justice that alleged that 3,062 voters were no longer living in Nevada when they cast their ballots. The lawsuit also challenges the county’s use of a machine as a step in signature verification. Whether any of those 3,000 or so voters were indeed ineligible to cast a vote remains to be seen. However there are circumstances under which a person who has moved can still cast a Nevada ballot, including if they left the state temporarily, are in the military or are students. Regardless, 3,000 votes (and assuming all such votes went to Biden) would not make up the difference for Trump as of Friday afternoon, when Biden led in Nevada by about 20,000 votes. Clark County Registrar Joe Gloria, who administers the election, said Nov. 5, ""We are not aware of any improper ballots that are being processed."" Nevada expanded voting by mail due to the pandemic, which Gloria said resulted in a slower process to complete the count. But he explained that election officials are taking the steps required to verify ballots. Ben Hovland, chairman of the bipartisan U.S. Election Assistance Commission, told PolitiFact that there was no evidence of illegal votes being counted to steal the election. Trump has made claims of widespread voter fraud repeatedly, including in 2016 when he said millions of illegal votes cost him the popular vote, a claim we rated Pants on Fire. ""Time and time again when rubber hits the road there is no evidence, no evidence in academic after academic study, in court case after court case — there was whole presidential commission election integrity to track down widespread voter fraud — none of those cases found widespread voter fraud,"" Hovland said. It’s possible when all the vote counting is finished that election officials will find some cases of fraudulent votes cast, but there is no evidence of widespread fraud.  ""The reality is voter fraud in this country is limited,"" Hovland said. ""It is isolated cases, usually small races where a few votes make a difference."" RELATED: Fact-checking Trump’s election fraud falsehoods in White House remarks Trump said, ""If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us."" At the time of Trump’s comments the process of counting legal ballots continued in a handful of states with close races. Election experts say that local election officials are proceeding by following their state laws to count and verify ballots. There is no evidence that proper counting of legal votes automatically means Trump wins. And there is no evidence of widespread counting of illegal votes or any scheme by Democrats to steal the election.

Claim about people 're-voting' in Iowa 2020 election is wrong
","House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-California) was talking on conservative commentator Laura Ingraham’s Fox News Channel show, The Ingraham Angle, on Nov. 5 about Republican claims of possible voter fraud when he referred to Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District race. Democratic Party candidate Rita Hart and Republican Party candidate Mariannette Miller-Meeks were in a tight battle for the seat. McCarthy said: ""I don’t have all the facts but I (sic) was just reported that they have allowed a little over 300 people to re-vote and now we’re behind."" ""What?"" Ingraham responded as McCarthy continued: ""Why would all those people vote different? Yes, I don’t have all the facts. Our attorneys are rushing there, but this is what’s transforming out across America."" No one got to re-vote, election officials in Iowa said. A problem existed but it was in how one Iowa county’s elections office registered votes from one of its precincts onto a spreadsheet, said Jasper County Auditor and Elections Commissioner Dennis Parrott and Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate. ""We reported wrong results on Election Night,"" Parrott said, a Democrat, at a Nov. 6 news conference in Newton, Iowa. ""It was human error, like a lot of things that happen."" The corrected unofficial numbers showed Hart leading by 162 votes. The totals were unofficial because individual county canvassing boards make the official counts and certification of votes the week after the election. Parrott said his office called Pate’s when the error was discovered and that Pate’s office walked Jasper County staff through re-checking to make sure the corrected unofficial vote count was, indeed, accurate. Additionally, Pate ordered a hand-count audit of the votes before the canvasses. He said every county in the district is conducting post-election audits in randomly selected precincts to ensure accurate vote counts. Interest in Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District race between Hart and Miller-Meeks is understandable. The seat, one of several for which the Associated Press did not call an immediate winner, had been held by a retiring Democrat, Dave Loebsack, and Republicans
were eager to flip it. Miller-Meeks held a 280-vote edge on election night in the 24 counties that the district covers. But two days later, Jasper County discovered its reporting error, Pate said at the news conference where he and Parrott appeared. ""That would be the difference you’re seeing,"" Pate, a Republican, said. McCarthy’s offices in California and Washington, D.C., did not return calls from PolitiFact seeking comment or clarification on what he said on national television or if he had heard from Iowa elections officials. Pate said more votes still could be eligible for the scheduled vote canvasses because they might arrive in the mail but sent on time. Or, he said, they could have been cast provisionally, which means they were made by voters knowing that their eligibility could be questioned and
ruled upon later. He said votes are verified by matching them with affidavits voters who cast them signed and whether or not the voters were registered. ""The key thing here is transparency, so you can see what happened,"" Pate said. The vote count is still going on, and the audit Pate ordered was to begin immediately and be done by Tuesday afternoon, when Jasper County canvasses its votes, he said. McCarthy said that 300 voters in Iowa were allowed to re-vote to change an election outcome. That is wrong. Pate and Parrott laid out in their news conference how the state first reported votes in Miller-Meeks’ favor swung to being in Hart’s favor. No one was allowed to re-vote, Pate’s office said. And even though McCarthy couched his televised statement by saying he didn’t know all the facts, he said it anyway, and Ingraham picked up on it as though it were fact.

Over 100 Republican challengers monitored absentee ballot count in Detroit
","On Nov. 4, chaos erupted at Detroit’s TCF Center, the convention hall where election workers processed and counted the city’s absentee ballots, as dozens of partisan poll monitors clamored to get into the counting area. They banged on the doors and windows, demanding that election workers stop the count until they could enter. Some Facebook posts aired claims that Republican challengers were improperly barred from observing the process. One post claimed, ""The Democrats are locking us out and not letting us in to supervise the ballot counting at the TCF Center in downtown Detroit!"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) President Donald Trump, whose campaign filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to stop the counting, repeated that claim in a speech Nov. 5, saying, ""Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit."" That’s not true, and many news networks halted their broadcasts of the president’s speech because he was spreading misinformation. The Facebook claim isn’t true either. A certain number of challengers, Democratic and Republican, were prohibited from entering TCF, but that’s because the number of challengers already observing the process had reached the limit allowed under state law, Detroit election officials said. Over 100 Republican challengers remained inside the room where absentee ballots were being counted. Detroit election workers gathered at TCF on Election Day to begin counting the absentee ballots. Chris Thomas, special adviser to Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey this election, said then that the process was going smoothly. Thomas noted that there was not ""wide scale challenging"" of ballots by the Republican and Democratic challengers. Michigan allows election challengers appointed by political parties and interest groups, as well as poll watchers, to observe the election process, including the counting. While credentialed election challengers at a polling place can question a voter’s eligibility to vote, poll watchers cannot. Detroit established 134 absent-voter counting boards to process and count ballots for the city’s 503 precincts at a central location. Under state law, one challenger per political party or sponsoring organization can observe each absent voter counting board. But on Wednesday, the number of challengers observing the count exceeded the allowed limit. At one point, there were more than 570 challengers in the counting room, the Detroit Free Press reported, including 227 Republican challengers. In a statement shared Wednesday, Lawrence Garcia, Detroit’s lead attorney, explained what happened next. ""We were well over the 134 maximum. In the haste of doing business, nobody noticed that until it was over 200 for each party, and at that point, we said, we better stop admitting people until some people leave, and we’re under the 134 number."" When additional challengers tried to enter, they were denied access. Election officials at TCF told those challengers that they couldn’t enter the counting area because the room was at capacity. An uproar followed. The challengers gathered outside began pounding on the doors and windows, demanding that they be let back in and that election workers stop counting ballots. Republican challengers claimed they were being unfairly kept out, but election officials barred both Republican and Democratic challengers from reentering. ""Those are the rules,"" Garcia said in his Wednesday statement, referring to the limits on challengers. ""We have to play by them.""  Election workers counting ballots asked security to place paper over the windows because they felt intimidated by Republican challengers banging on the doors and windows. Facebook users claimed that Republican challengers were unfairly barred from monitoring the counting of absentee ballots in Detroit. Hundreds of Democratic and Republican challengers were present in the counting area. At one point on Nov. 5, the number exceeded the legal limit, so election officials barred some challengers, both Republican and Democratic, from reentering TCF after they left. Other challengers were allowed to stay and observe the process. We rate the claim False. Tresa Baldas, Kristen Jordan Shamus, Niraj Warikoo and Evan Petzold contributed to this report.

"['Crime', 'Texas', 'Dan Patrick']","
No, Austin is not one of the most dangerous cities in Texas, let alone in the U.S.
","Texas’ top political leaders gathered in Houston Oct. 28 at a ""Back the Blue"" news conference to express support for police officers and lambaste cities that cut police budgets. Gov. Greg Abbott sat alongside Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, Texas House Speaker Dennis Bonnen, R-Lake Jackson, and U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, to reiterate plans for a state takeover of police functions in Austin after the City Council voted in August to cut $21.5 million from the police budget and shift another $128 million from the Police Department to other city departments. Abbott and other Republican leaders have criticized the council’s move repeatedly, but Patrick turned up the volume in remarks he gave during the Houston event. ""The city of Austin is a disaster if you haven’t been there. A great city, now one of the most dangerous cities in America and definitely in Texas,"" Patrick said. ""If we don’t back the police, we’re not going to have any police and you’re going to be left on your own,"" he said. ""And if you think that’s hyperbole, it’s not."" We were curious about Patrick’s claim that Austin is now one of the most dangerous cities in the U.S. and Texas. Let’s compare how Austin crime measures up against other major metropolitan areas. We don’t know exactly what Patrick means by the term ""dangerous"" — his office did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls for explanation. A city could be considered dangerous, for instance, by its vulnerability to floods, wildfires or other natural disasters that threaten a population’s security. But considering the context in which Patrick’s comments were made, a ""Back the Blue"" pledge event, it’s safe to assume that Patrick was referring to crime. We also don’t know what information Patrick based his claim on. However, criminologists took Patrick’s use of ""dangerous"" to specifically mean violent crime, or crimes that threaten a person’s physical safety. This category, defined by Austin police as crimes against persons, includes violations such as murder, kidnapping and assault. When ranking Austin’s violent crime rates to that of other large U.S. cities, Austin comes nowhere near the top of the list. Austin police reported 3,953 incidents of violent crime in 2019, a rate of about 400 incidents for every 100,000 residents, according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program. Among the nation’s 30 largest cities that report crime numbers to the FBI database, Detroit topped the list with about 1,965 violent incidents per 100,000 residents, followed by Memphis, Tenn., Baltimore and Milwaukee. Austin’s violent crime rate of 400 incidents per 100,000 residents ranked 28th among the 30 largest U.S. cities, above El Paso and San Diego. Austin ranked near the bottom of that list in 2018 and 2017 as well. Patrick’s second claim, that Austin is ""definitely"" one of the most dangerous cities in Texas, is also not borne out by last year’s crime data. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program shows that, among 534 Texas cities reporting data, Austin ranks 128th. The cities with the highest violent crime rates are South Padre Island, New Boston, Snyder and Oyster Creek, each with a rate above 1,200 incidents per 100,000 residents. If you look at only the largest 25 cities in Texas — cities with populations the size of Round Rock, 132,747, or larger — Austin ranked 13th. Houston, Lubbock, Dallas, Corpus Christi and Amarillo, in that order, are the cities with the highest violent crime rates in Texas. The FBI has not released any crime numbers for 2020, but the Austin police chief’s latest monthly report shows that, while certain categories of violent crimes are up, violent crime on the whole is about even with where it was this time last year. Murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, intimidation and incest are up so far, while rape, forcible sodomy, sexual assault, simple assault and others are down. Patrick’s claim is the latest attack from Republican leaders on the Austin City Council’s budget decision. In August, a week after the council approved the budget, Abbott held a news conference pledging to push legislation next year that would freeze property tax revenue for any city or county that cuts law enforcement spending. He also said Austin ""is the No. 1 city in America in the year-to-year percentage increase in murders, with a percentage increase of more than 64% for the first half of this year,"" citing the 23 homicides recorded in the first half of 2020 compared to the 14 recorded in the first half of 2019. A PolitiFact analysis rated his claim Half True, noting that percentage change figures can be misleading when dealing with low numbers. (Abbott made that statement in Fort Worth, which had a murder rate last year more than double Austin’s.) Then in October, Abbott said in a tweet that Austin’s property crime was rising and that ""this is the kind of thing that happens when cities defund and deemphasize police."" Another PolitiFact analysis rated that Mostly False. At the time Abbott made the claim, property crime was down by 2% this year compared to last year, Austin police reports show. The Texas Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative state legislators, released a video on Oct. 5 signaling its intent to join the fight against police budget cuts during the next legislative session. ""Crime is up because police funding is down. That’s the wrong direction for public safety in Texas,"" state Rep. Briscoe Cain, R-Baytown, said in the video. Patrick’s claim that Austin is now one of the most dangerous cities in the U.S. is a notable escalation of the political rhetoric, experts say. ""It’s a totally ridiculous comment and it’s completely divorced from reality,"" said Carsten Andresen, an assistant professor of criminal justice at St. Edward's University. ""It is possible to have a lot of critiques of Austin, and it’s possible to make a lot of critiques from a conservative perspective about Austin. But this remark is just a lying pants-on-fire situation."" ""It’s inaccurate to say that Austin has suddenly shot up and become this super dangerous place,"" said Texas State University criminologist Sean Roche. Roche also notes that prevalence of crime is not the only thing that influences how people perceive crime. Severity of crimes also influence our perception, especially crimes like murder. Austin recorded a rate of about 3.2 murders per 100,000 residents in 2019, making it the 15th highest murder rate among Texas’ 25 largest cities. This year, as of September, the rate was at about 3.5 murders per 100,000 residents. In describing Austin as a ""disaster,"" Patrick said that the city is ""now one of the most dangerous cities in America and definitely in Texas."" Among the 30 largest cities in the U.S., Austin's violent crime rate ranks 28th. And among the 25 largest cities in Texas, Austin ranks 13th.

Did President Trump issue secret watermarks on ballots? No, that’s another QAnon conspiracy theory
","As the nation waited for the presidential election results, a QAnon-related conspiracy theory began making the rounds on social media. Supposedly, President Donald Trump and the Department of Homeland Security set up Democrats (who allegedly aimed to cheat) by secretly watermarking ""official ballots."" A widely shared version of the claim on Facebook said, ""Consider: Dept. of Homeland Security controlled ‘official ballots’ production. Dems print extras, not knowing about non-radioactive isotope watermarks on ‘official ballots.’ Military sting operation. After weeding out all counterfeit ballots, Trump landslide confirmed."" Another related post referred to an old QAnon thread and said, in part: ""The ‘watch the water’ intel refers to .....THE WATERMARK on the official election ballots!!!!"" This is bogus. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, the federal government doesn’t print or issue ballots.  Instead, the responsibility lies with local governments, which usually contract with various printing companies and work with the U.S. Postal Service for design approval. Several news organizations have published stories that detail the printing process, including the increased demand for mail-in ballots amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  One of the biggest printing vendors is Runbeck Election Services, which maintains a 90,000-square-foot facility in Phoenix.  The company’s president and chief operating officer, Jeff Ellington, discussed the process with NPR in May, saying that getting ballots to the right voters is a complicated, multi-step process. ""States need to decide what their ballots will look like and to get approval from the U.S. Postal Service for the design of the envelopes,"" Ellington told the news organization. ""After those envelopes are secured, companies like Runbeck step in."" In 2018, former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen called on state and local election officials to ensure that ballots used during the 2020 presidential election can be audited. But this doesn’t involve the agency printing the ballots for states. It was a reminder to local officials to maintain a system of verifiable ballots to ensure security from foreign adversaries that may seek to interfere in future U.S. elections. In 2019, the department's cybersecurity agency announced it would partner with election officials and election nonprofit VotingWorks to develop an auditing tool known as Arlo, which is provided to state election officials for free. As for the watermark claims, ""the watch the water"" comment comes from a February 2018 QAnon thread, known as a ""Q drop,"" which are cryptic messages that the central figure of the conspiracy theory posts for followers to decipher.  No one on the two-year-old message thread interpreted ""water"" to mean ""watermark,"" but the recent Facebook post tried to connect the two. Watermarks do appear on some states’ ballots, like California’s, but there is no secret watermark on all ballots that was issued by the federal government to catch would-be cheaters. QAnon is a baseless conspiracy theory based on posts from Q, an anonymous internet persona who claims to be a government insider with information on a ""deep state"" plot against Trump. A QAnon-related conspiracy theory claims that Trump, with the help of the Department of Homeland Security, added secret watermarks to ballots in order to catch Democrats cheating. The federal government doesn’t print ballots or play an active role in the mechanics of elections.

PA Congressman Marino and the math for 20M ‘out of work’ Americans
","U.S. Rep. Tom Marino took to MSNBC to defend presumptive GOP Presidential nominee Donald Trump, and cited an eye-opening number of unemployed Americans in the process. Marino, a Republican who represents Pennsylvania’s 10th district, endorsed Trump in February, saying the decision was ""one of my life-changing moments,"" according to Politico. He appeared Thursday on MSNBC to defend the real estate mogul’s record and assert Trump, who’s never held elected office before, is the best person for the job. ""To those that are saying that this just isn’t going to work, let me ask you this question: How’s it been working the last 30 years with governors and senators and career politicians being president?"" he asked. ""We’re 20 trillion dollars in debt, 20 million people out of work, businesses leaving the country, people are afraid that they can’t even send their kids to college."" The idea that 20 million people are out of work in America sounded high, especially because the official number of unemployed Americans was 8 million as of April 1, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So we decided to check the fact. Marino’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment from PolitiFact, but we’ve looked into this claim before. Former presidential candidate John Kasich actually cited the 20 million figure in a campaign ad in February, and when PolitiFact asked the Kasich campaign for evidence, they proceeded to cite a source that caught us off-guard: Us. Specifically, they pointed to an even earlier fact check from August in which we analyzed a statement by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump said that ""we have 93 million people out of work. They look for jobs, they give up, and all of a sudden, statistically, they're considered employed."" We rated this claim False, largely because the 93 million number included lots of people who would not be expected to want or be able to work, including full-time students, senior citizens, the disabled, and those who have chosen to take care of their children full-time. However, in the process, we conducted a mathematical experiment in which we played with possible numbers of Americans who are ""out of work"" that fit somewhere between the official unemployment rate (on the low end) and Trump’s number (on the high end). Here’s what we wrote, using the statistics that were current at the time: The official number of unemployed Americans is 8.3 million -- less than one-tenth of what Trump says. But to give Trump the benefit of the doubt, it’s possible to expand this number using more credible economic thinking. Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, says it’s not unreasonable to include: This would mean that upwards of 21 million Americans could be described with some justification as ""out of work"" involuntarily, either fully or partially. But that’s not even one-quarter of the number that Trump offered. Rob Nichols, a spokesman for Kasich, said the campaign simply updated our math with more recent data in preparing the television ad. The numbers for January 2016, Nichols said, were: That works out to 20 million on the nose. We salute the Kasich campaign’s efforts to fact-check-proof their assertion. Still, we should note that we didn’t intend our calculation to be the final word on how to determine the number of ""out of work"" Americans. Rather, we were trying to provide a benchmark for showing just how wrong Trump’s number was. We’ll note that our wording was that the 21 million figure had ""some justification"" — not exactly a clarion call for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to change its longstanding protocol. In subsequent fact-checks, though not the one the Kasich campaign referred to, we have added language that is clearer about our intentions. We did that, for instance, in our Feb. 11, 2016, fact-check of a different statement by Trump: ""Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35 (percent). In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent."" In that fact-check, which produced a rating of Pants on Fire, we prefaced a similar alternative calculation this way: ""We are deliberately stretching the numbers here as an intellectual exercise; we are not saying that 15.6 percent is a more accurate unemployment rate than the official one of 4.9 percent."" But enough from us. What do the two economists we checked with for the original fact-check think about the use of the 20 million figure? ""Given that the image looks like a guy in an unemployment line, I'd say it's a misleading figure,"" said Tara Sinclair, an economist with George Washington University and the jobs website Indeed.com. Many people have good reasons for not wanting to work now, she said, and that is something distinct from actually being ""out of work."" Burtless agreed, saying, ""The 5.988 million people working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job are not ‘out of work.’ They are employed, but on a work schedule that does not provide them with the weekly hours they desire."" At the same time, Burtless said there is still some value in the number cited in Kasich’s advertisement. He called a the 20 million figure ""an upper-bound estimate of the total number of Americans who are unemployed or underemployed.""  It’s just not the only estimate. Our ruling Marino said on MSNBC that 20 million Americans are out of work. While the statement can be interpreted as accurate depending on the definition of ""out of work,"" it lacks context. We rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2016/may/09/tom-marino/pa-congressman-tom-marino-says-20-million-american/
"['History', 'Crime', 'Virginia', 'Terry McAuliffe']","
McAuliffe held Va. record for restoring felon voting rights before his blanket action
","The shock waves still are being felt from Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s blanket restoration of voting rights on April 22 to an estimated 206,000 Virginia felons who had served their prison sentences and completed their probationary periods. Republicans say the action is a ruse to help Hillary Clinton - McAuliffe’s close friend and fellow Democrat - carry Virginia in November’s presidential election. GOP legislative leaders have hired a lawyer to guide an expected lawsuit challenging the governor’s authority to order the sweeping restoration. McAuliffe says it’s only right to forgive people after they’ve served their punishments and that Virginia’s traditionally steep path toward restoration of rights can be traced to Jim Crow-era efforts to exclude black voters. The governor says that before his blanket action, he already had shattered the restoration-of-rights records by previous governors. Here’s what he said during an April 22 speech on the Capitol steps, moments before announcing his blanket policy. He also republished it on Medium.com. ""Today, I am proud to tell you that in a little more than two years that we have restored the rights of more than 18,000 individuals, which is more than the past seven governors combined in their four-year terms."" We wondered whether the McAuliffe’s figures were correct. The governor’s office sent us a data sheet with McAuliffe’s restoration numbers just before his announcement and those of every governor dating to 1938. We were able to confirm the figures of past administrations through old newspaper stories and with the help of Roger Christman, senior state governors’ archivist at the Library of Virginia. McAuliffe reports restoring the rights of 18,009 felons at the time of his announcement. Here’s how that compares with the previous seven governors, listed in descending order by their terms: •Republican Bob McDonnell, 8,111; •Democrat Tim Kaine, 4,402; •Democrat Mark Warner, 3,486; •Republican Jim Gilmore, 238; •Republican George Allen, 460; •Democrat Doug Wilder, 427; and •Democrat Jerry Baliles, 853. The seven governors restored rights to 17,977 felons - 32 fewer than McAuliffe’s total before his April 22 announcement. The seven governors, all serving four years, go back to 1986. Let’s keep going back, in descending order, to 1938: •Democrat Chuck Robb, 1,180; •Republican John Dalton, 939; •Republican Mills Godwin, 515; •Republican Linwood Holton, 303; •Democrat Mills Godwin, 260; •Democrat Albertis Harrison, 158; •Democrat Lindsay Almond, 136; •Democrat Tom Stanley, 163; •Democrat John Battle, 139; •Democrat William Tuck, 167; •Democrat Colgate Darden, 157; and •Democrat James Price, 273. If you’re wondering, the 19 governors before McAuliffe restored the rights of 22,367 felons. If McAuliffe’s action withstands legal challenge, he’ll have restored voting rights to about 224,000 felons in less than 2 1/2 years - 10 times more than the last 19 governors combined during their entire terms. McAuliffe says he’s empowered to issue a blanket restoration of rights and points to language in the Virginia Constitution that grants governors the authority to ""remove political disabilities"" for felons. Republicans say the governor must follow a more individualized process for restoring rights. The Richmond Times-Dispatch, in a May 3 article, said the GOP challenge could center on other language in the constitution that says no ""person"" convicted of a felony can vote unless ""his"" civil rights have been restored. Our ruling McAuliffe said that before issuing a blanket restoration of rights on April 22 to felons who had served their time, he already had ""restored the rights of more than 18,000 individuals, which is more than the past seven governors combined in their four-year terms.""

Donald Trump wrongly says noncitizens can vote when there is same-day voter registration
","Donald Trump said he does not support same-day voter registration because he says it makes it easier for noncitizens to vote. Because Trump complained repeatedly that the primary process was fixed, Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Trump if he supports policies that make it easier for people to vote. Same-day voter registration, for example, allows voters to register or update their information at the polls on Election Day. ""No, no,"" Trump said to the suggestion. ""I don't think people should sneak in through the cracks. And whether that's an ID or any way you want to do it. But you have to be a citizen to vote."" ""Well, of course,"" Todd replied. ""That is the law as it stands already."" Trump disagreed: ""No, it's not. I mean, you have places where people just walk in and vote."" In most states, people have to register to vote at least a few days prior to voting. But 15 states and the District of Columbia have or are in the process of implementing same-day voter registration. Is it really the case that noncitizens can just ""walk in and vote"" in these states? Election experts told us there’s no increased risk of noncitizens voting in states with same-day registration, as opposed to states that require voters to register in advance, because of the safeguards the states put in place. ""It’s not that you can just show up and vote — you have to register and provide necessary ID,"" said Michael McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida. To register someone to vote, states have to establish the voter’s identity and residency. To meet equivalent standards when registering people on Election Day, same-day registration states require the voter to bring proper identification and proof of residency, such as a utility bill, with them to the polls. The specifics, though, vary by state because each state makes its own election laws. So if there are problems with ineligible voters using same-day registration, it likely has more to do with how the state implements the program, rather than a problem inherent to the general concept of same-day registration, said Barry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin. For example, some, but not all, states have an electronic database that they can use to check a same-day registrant’s eligibility on the spot. Others, like Iowa and New Hampshire, send a mailer to all same-day registrants, and if the card is returned as undeliverable, the state will investigate the case as potential election fraud. But the bottom line is that states strive to hold everyone to the same level of scrutiny in terms of identity verification. ""For presidential elections, all states require voters to be U.S. citizens, and there is nothing inherent about same-day registration that would make it easier for noncitizens to vote,"" said Joshua Douglas, an election law professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law. Douglas noted that some local jurisdictions do allow noncitizens to vote in certain elections, but it’s still illegal for them to vote in federal elections. Every expert we asked told us that there are anecdotal examples of noncitizens voting in federal elections, but it’s rare. And there isn’t any evidence that it’s more prevalent in the states with Election Day registration. For someone to vote fraudulently using same-day registration, they would have to lie about their eligibility in the presence of poll workers and others, and they would create a paper trail by filling out the paperwork. These factors serve as deterrents, in addition to the potentially severe penalties a fraudulent voter could face, like deportation if the person was in the country illegally.    Burden pointed to a recent case in Wisconsin of a man who has been charged with election fraud for voting in the state’s April 5 presidential primary. The man, who is not a citizen but is in the United States on a green card, registered and voted at the polls on Election Day. But the state government caught the man, and a spokesman for the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board told the local news that the agency had never encountered a similar case before, in 40 years of Election Day voter registration. ""For someone who’s not eligible to vote, to walk into a polling place and use same-day registration is risky,"" Burden said, noting that there’s a higher risk of election fraud in activities that occur outside the polling location, such as mail-in ballots. Our ruling ""You have to be a citizen to vote,"" but with same-day voter registration, ""you have places where people just walk in and vote."" In states with same-day voter registration, people don’t just walk in and vote. They have to provide the same level of identification as when registering in advance. Experts told us there is no additional risk of noncitizens casting ballots in states with same-day voter registration, nor is there any evidence that this occurs.

""But I’m not under the illusion that that it’s going to pass. They’re going to come to me. They’re going to want to raise it for the rich more than anybody else."" He then explained why, despite that, he’s still sticking to his guns and giving ""a massive"" tax cut to businesses: ""We’re the highest taxed nation in the world. Our businesses pay more taxes than any businesses in the world. That’s why companies are leaving."" This is a version of one of Trump’s oft-repeated talking points, and it’s inaccurate. When we looked at this claim in the past, we compared the United States to the 33 other industrialized nations in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Data from 2014, the most recent year available, shows that the United States wasn’t the most highly taxed by the typical metrics and actually places near the bottom or around the middle of the pack. Trump specified this time that he was talking about business taxes, but the essential data doesn’t back him there, either. Trump would have been more accurate if he had been more specific. The United States does have one of the highest top marginal corporate tax rates in the world. However, companies pay less in practice because they can take deductions and exclusions. When we look at the actual tax burden on U.S. companies, it’s far from highest in the world. Here’s a chart breaking it down: Tax revenue as percentage of GDP Corporate tax revenue as percentage of GDP Tax revenue per capita 1. Denmark: 50.9% 2. France: 45.2% 3. Belgium: 44.7% 1. Norway: 7.1% 2. New Zealand: 4.4% 3. Luxembourg: 4.3% 1. Luxembourg: $49,911 2. Norway: $38,016 3. Denmark: $31,054 31. United States: 26.0% 17. United States: 2.6% 19. United States: $14,204 32. Korea: 24.6% 33. Chile: 19.8% 34. Mexico: 19.7% 30. Hungary: 1.5% 31. Slovenia: 1.4% 32. Greece: 1.3% 32. Turkey: $2,985 33. Chile: $2,886 34. Mexico: $2,094 OECD average: 34.2% OECD average: 2.9% OECD average: $14,923 The World Bank’s data for 2012 — the last year for which it has complete figures — also placed the United States near the bottom in tax revenue as a percentage of GDP. Nations with lower percentages were two OECD members (Japan and Spain), a couple of oil-rich countries (Oman and Kuwait) and few impoverished states (like Afghanistan and the Central African Republic). We also looked at a 2016 report by the World Bank and PricewaterhouseCoopers that assessed the total tax burden for a case study company in different places around the world. The total tax rate — which includes not only income taxes but also labor taxes, property taxes, profit taxes, etc. — is expressed as a percentage over the total profit. By this metric, the company would have a total tax rate of 43.9 percent in the United States, placing it at No. 64 out of 189 countries. That’s lower than the rates the company would have paid in the two countries Trump says the United States loses to, China (67.8 percent) and Mexico (51.7 percent). Moreover, it’s nowhere near the top. Our ruling Trump said, ""We're the highest taxed nation in the world."" By all metrics we looked at, the United States is far from the most taxed nation overall and for businesses. We rate Trump’s claim False.",/factchecks/2016/may/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-us-not-highest-taxed-nation-in-world/
"['Rhode Island', 'Guns', ""Michael O'Neill""]","
How many lives would be saved by a gun-free zone?
","A bill that would stop the state’s more than 3,000 concealed-carry permit holders from bringing their weapons into Rhode Island schools quickly became the center of attention at an April 26 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Sponsored by Sen. Harold Metts, D-Providence, Senate Bill 2761 would make schools ""gun free zones,"" meaning that only ""peace officers"" — defined in state law as people who are sanctioned by the school and have extensive firearms training — could carry weapons in school zones. This roiled Second Amendment enthusiasts who argued against the bill, saying it would put kids at higher risk for acts of terrorism. Legal gun owners, or ""good guys,"" can help disarm a potential attacker if they are on school grounds before police arrive, Michael O’Neill, a pro-bono lobbyist for the Rhode Island 2nd Amendment Coalition said at the hearing. Sen. Frank Lombardi, D-Cranston, and Sen. Stephen Archambault, D-Smithfield, both agreed with O’Neill on that point. ""If we're going to issue law-abiding concealed-carry permits to people,"" Archambault said, ""... I'd rather know there's a chance someone can put down a lunatic.""   O’Neill added: ""There’s no data that says a gun-free zone has saved lives."" We reached out to O’Neill, and his colleague Frank Saccoccio, also of the Rhode Island 2nd Amendment Coalition, to clarify. We briefly spoke with both men. Saccoccio said he’d send us information via email Tuesday night. By Friday, he hadn’t sent us an email, and he hasn’t returned subsequent emails and phone calls. On the other side of the argument, support for the bill comes from school committees across the state, Attorney General Peter Kilmartin, the Rhode Island Association of School Principals and the Rhode Island Federal of Teachers and Health Professionals, among others. Is it possible that it's not backed up by data? Is there no data?  O’Neill’s statement is tough to refute because it’s so broad, said Linda Finn, a spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence. There may not be data that gun-free zones have ""saved lives."" It’s hard to disprove a claim like that. Further, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the leading national public health institute — has not extensively researched firearms since 1996, when the National Rifle Association accused the agency of promoting gun control. After the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, President Obama signed an executive order reversing the research ban. But nearly four years later, Congress still hasn’t approved the funding. There is, though, ""plenty of data that shows that when guns are present, it increases the likelihood of an injury or death,"" Finn told us. Like when Michelle Ferguson-Montgomery, a sixth-grade teacher and a concealed-carry permit holder in Utah, shot herself in the leg in the school bathroom in September 2014. Or when an Idaho State University professor literally shot himself in the foot with his concealed gun on campus. Then there’s a psychological phenomenon called the ""weapons effect."" Numerous peer-reviewed studies, including one dating back to 1967, show the presence of a weapon, or just a photo of one, leads to aggressive behavior in humans. This is especially true when stress levels are high -- say, in an active school shooter situation.   The study ""Does the Gun Pull the Trigger?"" published in ""Psychological Science"" in 1996 showed that ""simply identifying weapons increases the accessibility of aggressive thoughts."" This theory played out for a Barrington sixth grader, according to testimony by his father, Willis Peter Bilderback. Bilderback testified that his son became ""very afraid"" after his teacher told him he had a firearm in his desk. The boy was so shaken that he switched out of the class and had repeated nightmares of ""his teacher attempting to track him down with a gun and kill him,"" according to Bilderback’s testimony. ""The fact that my son believed his teacher had a gun in the classroom turned a nationally recognized blue-ribbon Middle School into a house of horrors for him,"" Bilderback wrote. But do ‘good guys"" help? There is anecdotal evidence to back up O’Neill and Archambault’s idea — some of which is outlined in this  Washington Post blog from October 2015. In Chicago in April 2015, an Uber driver with a concealed-carry permit ""shot and wounded a gunman who opened fire on a crowd of people,"" according to a Chicago Tribune report. A similar incident played out in a Philadelphia barber shop. And an FBI ""Study of Active Shooter Incidents in the United States Between 2000 and 2013"" showed that out of the 160 incidents studied, in 21 cases  unarmed citizens ""made the selfless and deeply personal choice"" to confront the shooter, and ended the threat. There were seven times that an armed, off-duty police officer, citizen or security guard used a weapon to end the threat. Our ruling: O’Neill says ""there’s no data that says a gun-free zone has saved lives."" He is correct. There is no definitive data to say that a gun-free zone has saved lives. In part, that’s because the CDC has been blocked from studying anything related to firearms for the last 20 years. And also because ""saved lives"" are hard to quantify. However, there are many anecdotes, scholarly articles and federal studies with data showing that just the presence of guns can cause anxiety and increase aggressive behavior. Plus, there are the teachers who accidentally shot themselves on school grounds. And yes, there are the cases in which the ""good guys"" prevail.

"['Transportation', 'Texas', 'Sylvester Turner']","
Sylvester Turner overstates number of solo drivers
","When Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner announced Carrin Patman as the new chairwoman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of Harris County board, he emphasized the vital role Patman would play in reducing Houstonians’ dependence on cars. ""We have been focusing so much, especially the Texas Department of Transportation, on that 97 percent of people in single-occupancy vehicles,"" he said. Since Turner became mayor in January 2016, he’s emphasized public transit and other ways of fighting congestion in contrast to building more highways, a traditional focus of TxDOT. Turner, introducing Patman, brought up TxDOT’s focus on single-occupancy vehicles because he disagrees with the strategy of building roads to ease traffic congestion. We wanted to check his facts. Are 97 percent of people in single-occupancy vehicles? Origin of the 97 percent statistic The 97 percent statistic wasn’t limited to the March 4, 2016, event at City Hall. In fact, it’s been a regular part of Turner’s stump speeches of late, according to Houston Chronicle transportation reporter Dug Begley.  He also mentioned the number at an announcement for other Metro appointments March 18, 2016, and at the Texas Active Transportation and Trails Conference in Houston on March 9, 2016, Begley said. We called the mayor’s staff to see where the 97 percent figure came from. His press team referred us to the city’s Planning and Development Department, which they said wrote Turner’s  March 4 speech. By phone, Suzy Hartgrove, the planning department’s public affairs manager, told us the statistic referred to drivers in all of Texas -- not just Houston -- and that it had come from TxDOT Commissioner Bruce Bugg of San Antonio. Hartgrove said Bugg brought up the statistic at a January 25, 2016, meeting in to discuss traffic congestion in the Houston region. By email, Hartgrove forwarded Bugg’s slide show from a Jan. 28, 2016, presentation to Houston TranStar, the body that coordinates city and state agencies to respond to Houston-area traffic incidents. A slide in the presentation says that Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio were ""home to 97 of the top 100 most congested roadway segments in Texas in 2015."" In the email Hartgrove forwarded to us, planning department staff discussed how Bugg’s 97-of-100 point may have been misinterpreted in its drafting of Turner’s remarks. We turned to TxDOT; Austin-based spokeswoman Veronica Beyer responded by email, saying that Bugg ""never used the words ‘single-occupancy vehicle.’"" On the other hand, Beyer said, Bugg has offered a few similar statistics, including that ""97 percent of Texans who choose to travel do so by car, truck or van."" What that statistic means  When Turner first started bringing up this statistic in January, the Houston Chronicle took a close look at his facts. In Jan. 28, 2016, remarks before the Texas Transportation Commission, Turner said that ""TxDOT has noted that 97 percent of Texans currently drive a single-occupancy vehicle for their daily trips."" That comment differs slightly from his statement at hand -- it refers to daily trips, not 97 percent of all people. Begley’s analysis of that number in an annotated transcript of the speech helps with the number we’re looking at, too: ""This number is commonly used in various ways but is misapplied most of the time,"" the Chronicle said. ""In a 2006 study by Texas A&M University, it was stated 95.4 percent of workers over age 16 use a car, van or truck to get to work. However the number included carpoolers and only covered trips to [and] from work, as opposed to all driving. According to the Census Bureau, 79.9 percent of commuters drive alone to work in the state. Around 11 percent share a ride to work. About 4 percent work at home and 1.6 percent statewide use public transit."" The upshot: ""Solo drivers dominate any breakdown of how Texans travel, but it is not as high as many people claim,"" the story said. Beyer, from TxDOT, also offered some backup that points to these numbers from the Chronicle as the most reliable. She sent us a chart from the U.S. Department of Commerce indicating that in 2013, 96.1 percent of Texans who commuted to work chose a car, truck or van. Notably, that figure folded in carpools so it wasn’t referring solely to single-occupancy vehicles. How many people are in single-occupancy vehicles?  Absent other data, then, we suspect it’s not quite 97 percent of people driving single-occupancy vehicles. So, how many are driving solo? It’s hard to say exactly. We have the numbers on commuters from the Census Bureau: 79.9 percent of Texas workers in 2013 drove alone to work. For all driving, however, it’s tougher to pinpoint how many people driving solo. We reached out to the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A&M University, which connected us with Phil Lasley, a researcher there. Lasley told us by phone that it is difficult to get numbers related to all trips. Surveys that measure that data are rarely done, he said. Lasley was looking at the Census data that says 79.9 percent of people drive alone to work. Lasley, asked if that number would be higher or lower if it took into account all driving, said he thought it would be higher. ""People who carpool are generally going to work. People wouldn’t jump in a carpool to go to the dry cleaners or pick up kids from school,"" he said. During the school day especially, when many people are on the road getting errands done, drivers tend to be by themselves, he said. Lasley also pointed out that trips to and from work -- which is the data the 79.9 percent refers to, and the closest survey result we found to generally gauge single-occupancy drivers -- only made up 16 percent of all trips in Texas from April 2008 to April 2009, according to the 2009 National Household Travel Survey, the most recent (the 2016 survey is underway). Most driving was for social and recreational trips, errands and shopping before commuting. The average vehicle in that time frame, driving for all purposes, had 1.67 people in it, according to the National Household Travel Survey. Our ruling  Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, decrying traditional emphases on road building to ease traffic congestion, said 97 percent of people drive single-occupancy vehicles. This figure looks like it was based on a misread of another official’s declarations. And while we found little data about how many of us always drive solo, Census research suggests that about 80 percent of commuters drive alone, but commuting accounts for less than 20 percent of total driving, according to the latest survey we could find. It is 100 percent time to park this stat; we rate his claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

"['Elections', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
Vexed by Donald Trump, has Paul Ryan changed his position on backing GOP presidential nominee?
","On May 3, 2016, Donald Trump earned the title of presumptive Republican presidential nominee by winning decisively in Indiana’s GOP primary election. Ted Cruz, who is second in delegates behind Trump, dropped out of the race the same night. And John Kasich, the final remaining contender, ended his campaign the next day. But less than 48 hours after Hoosiers gave Trump his climactic victory (for which he gives ex-basketball coach Bobby Knight big credit), House Speaker Paul Ryan made huge headlines by saying he is not ready to support Trump for president. Previously, the Wisconsin Republican has said he will support the GOP nominee. So, has Ryan -- the chairman of the convention and the highest-ranking member of his party to explicitly withhold his support from Trump -- flip-flopped? Let’s pivot to our Flip-O-Meter, which determines whether a politician has changed position on an issue. Past statements Here are some of the statements Ryan has made in recent weeks: Jan. 13, 2016: Today Show host Matt Lauer asked, referring to Trump: ""If he becomes the nominee of the party, will you support him? Ryan replied: ""Yes, I will. I'll support whoever our nominee is."" March 1, 2016: At his weekly news conference with reporters, Ryan criticized Trump for equivocating about receiving support from white supremacists, but said: ""I plan to support the nominee. I think I’ve said enough this morning about what’s happening right now. My plan is to support the nominee."" March 15, 2016: Asked at a news conference at the Republican National Committee's headquarters whether whether he would support the eventual nominee, whoever it may be, Ryan said he would, adding: ""My position hasn’t changed on that.""   Post-presumptive statements Compare those to what Ryan said to CNN host Jake Tapper on May 5, 2016: Tapper: So, Mr. Speaker, you have said throughout this process that you will support the Republican presidential nominee. Now you have a presumptive nominee, Donald Trump. Will you support him? Ryan: Well, to be perfectly candid with you, Jake, I’m just not ready to do that at this point. I’m not there right now. And I hope to, though, and I want to. But I think what is required is that we unify the party. And I think the bulk of the burden on unifying the party will have to come from our presumptive nominee. Moments later, there was a follow-up question. Tapper: So you’re saying you can’t support or endorse him right now? Ryan: Yes, I am basically saying that ….But at this point, I think that he needs do more to unify this party to bring all wings of the Republican Party together ... Pretty clearly a partial change in position. Ryan invited Trump to meet Tuesday, May 10, with Republican House leaders, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus is expected to meet that day with Ryan and Trump, according to a statement from Ryan’s office. Our rating Ryan has said repeatedly he would support for president whomever wins the Republican nomination. He said so even when asked specifically about Trump being the nominee. But in his first comments after Trump became the presumptive nominee, Ryan wavered. He did not say he would not support Trump. But he stated he is not ready to support him at this time. It’s worth noting that the party won’t officially have a nominee until its convention in Cleveland in July 2016, although no one but Trump is in a position to claim the nomination. But for pledging to support the GOP nominee and now withholding that support, at least for the time being, we give Ryan a Half Flip.",/factchecks/2016/may/06/paul-ryan/vexed-donald-trump-has-paul-ryan-changed-his-posit/

Donald Trump attacked for bringing in hundreds of foreign workers on H-2B visas at Mar-A-Lago
","Donald Trump has promised to be the ""greatest jobs president that God ever created."" But he’s also been attacked for his record of hiring foreign workers. A Ted Cruz ad that aired in Indiana attacked Trump’s use of temporary foreign visas known as the H-2B program: ""Trump still brings in hundreds of foreign workers to replace Americans,"" stated the narrator. Cruz dropped out of the presidential race May 3 after losing Indiana, but we suspect Democrats will be happy to launch this same attack line at Trump in the months to come. So we decided to look into it. The bottom line: Trump did try to hire hundreds of foreign workers at his Mar-A-Lago resort in Palm Beach, although it’s unclear just how many actually took jobs. The workers also weren’t necessarily replacing Americans, but filled temporary jobs locals allegedly couldn’t do or didn’t want. Mar-A-Lago foreign workers Trump’s Mar-A-Lago Club in Palm Beach County is an oceanfront eating club designed for the 1 percenters. The club’s website describes itself as offering ""an incomparable, royal lifestyle"" in a historic 126-room mansion. It offers a beach and pool, a spa and fine dining for those who can afford the $100,000 initiation fee. The club’s director of human resources referred us to the campaign for this fact-check, and a campaign spokeswoman did not respond. The charge that Trump hires foreign workers revolves around the club seeking H-2B visas for low-skilled workers such as cooks, wait staff and housekeepers. H-2B visas are legal — Congress has set the cap at 66,000 per year — and its agricultural counterpart is the H-2A visa. Nationwide for both programs, the vast majority of the workers are young Mexican men, although news reports say Trump sought workers from Europe. Employers argue they need these temporary workers to fill jobs Americans don’t want, while critics say the workers can be exploited. Since the visas are tied to a particular job, the foreigners can’t simply jump ship for a better paying job at another resort, and unlike Americans, they may be reluctant to raise any complaints with their employers. Since 2010, nearly 300 U.S. residents applied or were referred for jobs at Mar-A-Lago, but only 17 were hired, the New York Times reported. Meanwhile, Mar-A-Lago sought more than 500 visas for foreign workers. (The visas were also sought at some of his other properties.) We don’t know how many people actually used the visas and became employees. A spokesman for the State Department said that information is kept confidential. To obtain the visas, businesses must prove they tried but couldn’t fill positions with Americans or legal residents. According to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, the resort posted jobs through CareerSource Florida, the local workforce development boards throughout the state. A U.S. Labor Department spokesman told PolitiFact Florida that 93 people applied for 250 seasonal job openings. Four were hired, while 79 didn’t answer interview requests or turned down jobs (10 applications were classified with unknown status). Documents the resort later filed with the Labor Department showed that many of the American applicants weren’t hired because they didn’t meet requirements. Some applicants didn’t want to work split shifts, or didn’t have enough experience. Many wanted full-time jobs instead of part time, or didn’t respond when the resort contacted them. One applicant said they only were applying as a prerequisite to continue getting unemployment. After that process, the Labor Department certified 685 H-2B visas for the Mar-A-Lago Club between 2008 and 2015. News reports suggested Mar-A-Lago did the bare minimum to meet legal requirements to try to recruit U.S. workers. For example, CNN wrote that job openings were placed in a local newspaper with small circulation for just two days rather than a larger newspaper. Nationally, while employers claim there are labor shortages in lower- and semi-skilled occupations, ""there is no credible evidence that such labor shortages exist,"" wrote Daniel Costa, an immigration expert at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, in a paper in January. The New York Times asked Trump why he hired so many foreign workers when Americans applied for the same positions. ""The only reason they wouldn’t get a callback is that they weren’t qualified, for some reason,"" Trump replied. ""There are very few qualified people during the high season in the area."" But some experts question Trump’s assessment that it’s hard to find local help. In 2015, CareerSource assisted in placing nearly 1,800 candidates in hospitality jobs in Palm Beach County. But Mar-A-Lago didn’t show much interest in using the free service. Tom Veenstra, senior director of support services at CareerSource in Palm Beach County, told PolitiFact Florida that the first time his office received a request for helping finding workers was September 2015. (That was shortly after one of the first news reports, by Reuters, about Trump’s foreign hiring practice.) Since that time, Mar-A-Lago used the office to hire just one person, a banquet server. ""We called the HR director after the hire, and she said they were pleased with the hire and the candidates we sent them,"" Veenstra said. ""There has been nothing else since then."" There are plenty of local applicants, said Greg Schell, an attorney in Palm Beach County who represents foreign workers. ""The local job fairs for hotels and other hospitality jobs are overwhelmed with applicants,"" he said. Our ruling A Cruz ad says that Donald Trump ""brings in hundreds of foreign workers to replace Americans."" Federal labor records show Trump sought visas for hundreds of foreign workers to fill temporary positions at his Mar-A-Lago Club in recent years. Hundreds of U.S. applicants either applied or were referred for the jobs, but only a handful were hired. There is some debate about whether those applicants were qualified or not. Cruz makes it sound like foreign workers took jobs from Americans already in positions, but that’s not the case. It’s an ongoing debate whether there were qualified Americans who would have been willing to work the seasonal, part-time service jobs for which the club was hiring. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2016/may/06/ted-cruz/donald-trump-attacked-bringing-hundreds-foreign-wo/

Gubernatorial candidate Chris Koster right about $50 million on the line with tobacco loophole
","As part of his campaign to become Missouri’s 56th governor, Chris Koster tweeted a statistic about something he has been working to accomplish during his time as attorney general: closing the tobacco loophole. In his tweet, Koster called upon the legislature to #FixTheLoophole, which he says will save Missourians $50 million. The so-called tobacco loophole is money the state hopes to get from five big tobacco companies if it takes a tougher line with smaller ones. We looked into whether $50 million is really on the line. Tobacco background We reached out to the Koster campaign to find out what closing the loophole entailed. We heard back from David Turner, a spokesman for the Missouri Democratic Party. Turner told us that the tobacco loophole arose in 1998 as part of a master settlement agreement between the attorneys general of 46 states, along with Washington, D.C., and five U.S. territories, and the five largest tobacco companies in the U.S. The states had sued the tobacco companies for selling cigarettes which they knew caused cancer, emphysema and other diseases. The attorneys general wanted to recover the cost of caring for those people. The settlement said that in exchange for dropping the lawsuits, the states would receive roughly $10 billion dollars a year, essentially indefinitely. The annual payment to Missouri is about $130 million. As part of the deal, Missouri passed a law that required all nonparticipating tobacco companies to pay into an escrow fund. This was done in part to ensure that small cigarette makers didn’t gain a market advantage because they would be able to sell cigarettes at reduced prices.  But there was a catch. If a state failed to ""diligently enforce"" the requirement that small companies make escrow payments, and the big tobacco companies lost a set amount of market share as a result, that state would lose a portion of its tobacco settlement money. According to a state auditor, that’s exactly what happened. The big tobacco companies lost an 8 percent market share from 1997 to 2003. As a result, the companies sued Missouri and other states for violating the settlement. In 2013, an arbitration panel found that in Missouri, of the 432 million cigarettes sold by nonparticipating manufacturers in 2002, companies made escrow payments on only $102 million. The panel ruled against Missouri and five other states, meaning the Show-Me State had to pay back $70 million from its 2014 payment. In February, Koster negotiated an agreement with the tobacco companies to return $50 million to Missouri — on the condition the state tighten the rules on the smaller cigarette makers. Which brings us to the loophole. Under current Missouri law, the smaller companies can trim the amount they pay into the escrow fund. Missouri is the only state that has yet to take steps to prevent this. The loophole The way escrow payments are calculated, small tobacco companies can get most of the money they pay back if they restrict their sales to only a few states. In order to close the loophole — and return $50 million to Missouri — the legislature would have to pass Senate Bill 1096. The bill would require all nonparticipating manufacturers to either join the master settlement or be subject to modified escrow rules which prevent the companies from gaming the system to keep their escrow money. SB 1096 has supporters on both sides of the aisle, but it is not without its opponents. Small tobacco companies have been fighting different versions of the bill for more than a decade, calling it a tax on their products and a move on the part of big tobacco to earn more market share at their expense. SB 1096 has yet to pass either chamber of the General Assembly, and the consequences are already being felt. Because the bill failed to pass before April 15, Missouri can no longer receive the $50 million for 2016. In order to receive the money in 2017, the bill must be signed by Gov. Jay Nixon by June 3. Taxpayer impact The loophole is the source of Koster’s $50 million figure, but will recouping the loss actually save taxpayers money? It certainly has cost the state. In October, Nixon withheld $46.1 million of the state's budget, relying on the passage of SB 1096 to fill the gap. Turner said that money would have gone to the Mental Health Department and the Department of Social Services, among others. For these programs to be maintained at their initial levels, Turner explained, taxpayers would be forced to cover the money lost in the tobacco arbitration. Gaining the $50 million dollars would allow those programs to remain uncut without costing the taxpayers any additional money. All things being equal, if the bill passes, taxpayers would win no matter what the state does with the money. If it’s spent on services, citizens get the benefit of $50 million worth of services. If the state cuts spending and lowers taxes, they save money when they file their taxes in April. And that’s just in 2017. If the loophole isn’t closed, Missouri could lose additional money in the years to come. The big tobacco companies have begun arbitration concerning Missouri’s diligent enforcement of the escrow laws in 2004. If an arbitration panel were to find against Missouri again, the state could be forced to forfeit more money. If SB 1096 passes, the companies would not seek arbitration for any of the years 2004 to 2014, per Koster’s agreement. Our ruling Koster said that closing the tobacco loophole would save Missouri taxpayers $50 million. The tobacco settlement and the arbitration that followed is complicated, but ultimately, Koster did reach a settlement to return $50 million dollars to Missouri. If the legislature passes SB 1096 by June 3, that money would come to the state in 2017. If it doesn’t, the state could potentially be on the hook for even more. Any money the state received would be dollars that taxpayers would not have to provide. Taxpayers could get $50 million worth of services or $50 million in tax cuts. Either way, they come out ahead.

Is legislation backed by Paul Ryan to help debt-ridden Puerto Rico a 'bailout'?
","Wracked by a decade-long recession, Puerto Rico started borrowing, to cover budget shortfalls. Many Americans obliged, by buying Puerto Rican bonds, which are exempt from federal, state and local taxes in all 50 states. Now Puerto Rico is $72 billion in debt and defaulting on its debt payments. Don’t care much? Congress does. After all, Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory; 3.5 million of the island’s residents are U.S. citizens. And now the word bailout is being thrown around.  Puerto Rico’s debt problems Owes $72 billion -- nearly 100% of its annual economic output Defaulted on most of a $422 million in debt payment in May 2016 Owes a payment of nearly $2 billion due in July 2016 Ryan does back a bill for Puerto Rico that is sponsored by a fellow Wisconsin Republican, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy. But the bill is not what is commonly understood to be a bailout. That is, unlike American banks and automakers that got bailed out, Puerto Rico would not get any U.S. tax dollars. At the same time, the ad is careful to say the ""bailout"" would hurt ""savers and seniors,"" not taxpayers. And Duffy’s bill, experts tell us, almost certainly would mean lower returns for perhaps hundreds of thousands of Americans who invested in what long had been regarded as safe Puerto Rican bonds. The ad The sponsor of the nationally televised ad is the Center for Individual Freedom, a conservative non-profit based outside of Washington, D.C. that does not disclose its donors. The center says its mission is to ""protect and defend individual freedoms and individual rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution."" Here’s a full description of the 30-second, narrated ad, which was unveiled April 13, 2016: Washington is trying to pull a fast one. The Obama administration and leaders in Congress want to bail out Puerto Rico. The words ""Bail out Puerto Rico"" appear on the screen over photos of Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi, President Barack Obama and Ryan. It's called Super Chapter 9. It grants Puerto Rico unprecedented bankruptcy protections. You pay for it. Pictures of older men and women appear on the screen. Retirement accounts crushed. A bailout on the backs of savers and seniors. Washington politicians try to claim otherwise. The photos of Pelosi, Obama and Ryan reappear. But we know a bad bailout when we see one. Don't be fooled. No Super 9 bailout of Puerto Rico. The Center for Individual Freedom didn’t respond to our call and emails asking for evidence to back its claim. But a news release from the group makes it clear the center is calling Duffy’s bill a bailout. The bill would establish a federal Oversight Board to assist Puerto Rico in managing its public finances. Ultimately, a judge would have the power to reduce the $72 billion in debt, according to the Washington Post. The experts we consulted agreed with Ryan, who has said the bill is not a taxpayer bailout of Puerto Rico, given that it would not commit any U.S. funds to the island. But the experts also agreed with U.S. Rep. John Fleming, R-La., a critic who has said the bill would function like a bailout because Congress would be ""changing the rules"" to benefit Puerto Rico. The rules would change under the bill in that Puerto Rico could restructure its debt, similar to what is done in a so-called Chapter 9 bankruptcy, and pay less to some creditors than the creditors are owed. In terms of the impact on American investors, many bond funds have already sold their Puerto Rican debt, and the debt is now mostly owned by hedge funds, according to the Associated Press. But Oppenheimer Funds and Franklin Templeton still own part of the debts. So, a restructuring almost certainly would mean that Americans who, through brokers or choices they made in their retirement accounts, put some of their savings into Puerto Rican bonds almost certainly will get a lower return on their money, the experts told us. But there is one more consideration, said Simon Johnson, a professor of global economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management: Americans who invested in Puerto Rican bonds thinking they were safe overestimated how safe they are, as the island’s debt crisis shows. With an Oversight Board managing a debt restructuring, savers likely will get a lower return than they expected. But without such a board, creditors would be fighting in court and the returns for individuals investors would likely be lower still. Our rating The Center for Individual Freedom, a Super PAC, says in a TV ad that Ryan backs a proposal that would be a ""bailout"" of Puerto Rico. The ad is misleading in its repeated use of the word bailout, in that legislation supported by Ryan -- unlike past bailout bills -- would not direct any U.S. tax dollars to the debt-ridden island. But the ad was careful to say the ""bailout"" would hurt ""savers and seniors."" And experts told us the bill almost certainly would result in lower returns for Americans who invested money in Puerto Rican bonds.

Jerry Brown’s Half True Claim About California Doubling Florida’s Job Gains
"," Stoking a cross-country feud between the Sunshine and Golden states, Florida Gov. Rick Scott traveled to California for the second time in as many years to urge businesses to move to his state. In his visit this week, Scott said the sun shines more on businesses in Florida, with its lower taxes and less-stringent regulation. The Florida governor also warned California firms of the harm he said would result from the Golden State’s future minimum wage hike to $15 per hour. PolitiFact recently examined a claim by Enterprise Florida, the state’s public-private economic development arm, which said California would lose 700,000 jobs due to the wage hike. The national website rated the misleading claim Mostly False. FROM TWITTER On my way to tell CA businesses why FL has the best business climate. #FLvsCA   California Gov. Jerry Brown, perhaps tired of the job-poaching efforts of governors in Texas and Florida, shot back at Gov. Scott with claims that the Golden State’s job picture is, well, very sunny. ""As one of the millions of tourists flocking to the Golden State this time of year, we’d like to extend a warm welcome to (Florida Gov. Rick Scott). We can understand why he’s coming back -- there’s lots to do and plenty to learn,"" Brown said in a statement on April 26. His office issue a similar press release a few days later. ""In fact, since his last 2,000 mile cross-country jaunt, California has added twice as many jobs as Florida, while paying down debt, building a robust rainy day fund and taking bold action on issues Governor Scott continues to ignore, like climate change and poverty,"" Brown said in the statement. FROM TWITTER .@JerryBrownGov to @FLGovScott: Time to stop the silly political stunts & start doing something about #ClimateChange pic.twitter.com/nuWwhEBu9I   There’s a lot to unpack there. So we focused just on Brown’s statement about California adding twice as many jobs as Florida, and whether there was any context missing. It turns out California’s job picture is not really brighter than Florida’s, at least not during the period Brown described. Our research We looked at data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for the two states, from May 2015 to March 2016. Scott’s first visit was in April 2015. Last month’s data was not yet available. During this span, California added 354,100 jobs while Florida added 190,500 jobs. That’s 1.86 times as many jobs as the Sunshine State -- not quite twice as many but pretty close. Brown’s office also pointed to a slightly different time period, January through December 2015, when California added 1.97 times as many jobs as Florida. Of course, California is a much larger state with 39.1 million people -- almost double Florida’s population of 20.3 million. One would expect California to add more jobs than Florida, to keep up with the millions more people who live here. For some context, we checked the states’ job growth rates during this period. Florida had a slightly faster job growth rate at nearly 2.4 percent compared with California’s 2.2 percent. Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown said California has added twice as many jobs as Florida since that state’s governor visited in April 2015 on a job recruiting tour. Brown's claim is close on the raw numbers. But it leaves out the important context that California is a much larger state that needs to add more jobs to keep its millions more people employed. The federal jobs data show California added 1.86 times as many jobs as Florida during this period, a bit less than twice as many. California often leads the nation in overall job gains due to its sheer size. But the pace of that job growth tells a different story. Florida actually added jobs at a slightly faster rate, nearly 2.4 percent compared with California’s 2.2 percent, during the period in question. That takes a lot of the shine off Brown's statement.

Hillary Clinton video lists 8 promises of Donald Trump presidency. Did he say that?
","Even before Donald Trump’s Republican rivals bowed out, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton posted a video warning about a potential Trump presidency. The video opens with a clip of Trump at an event saying, ""Everything I say I’m going to do folks, I do."" It then lists eight steps Trump has said he will take. As the text of each one appears on the screen, audio of Trump plays in the background. We’ll go through in order and assess whether Trump really has made each promise. We asked the Trump campaign if any of these promises were misstated, or if they weren’t actually promises. We did not hear back. ‘Get rid of gun-free zones on schools on his first day’ At a campaign event in Burlington, Vt., on Jan. 7, 2016, Trump said that the number of victims in San Bernardino, Calif., and in Paris would have been much lower if the people in those places had been armed. He lamented the deaths of five soldiers in a shooting rampage in Chattanooga, Tenn. ""I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools, and — you have to — and on military bases,"" Trump said. ""My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There's no more gun-free zones."" The Clinton campaign also cited an interview with Trump on the Outdoor Channel Jan. 21, 2016, in which he said, ""I'm going to get rid of gun-free zones on military bases. I'm also going to do it in schools."" Trump has said little recently about gun-free zones, but the issue resurfaced when a petition emerged that would allow delegates to the Republican National Convention to carry guns. On March 28, 2016, ABC reporter Jonathan Karl asked Trump if he would support that. Trump said he would consider the petition, but the Secret Service ruled out allowing guns at the conventions as a security risk. ‘Defund Planned Parenthood’ Trump’s stance on funding Planned Parenthood has shifted somewhat over time. In August 2015, he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that it would be worth shutting down the government to cut off tax dollars going to Planned Parenthood. But he has also praised the organization for providing regular care to women of limited means. In March, Trump said, ""Millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood,"" and then continued ""but we're not going to allow, and we're not going to fund, as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood."" Trump’s overarching position on taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood is that he supports defunding Planned Parenthood so long as the organization continues to perform abortions. ‘Repeal Obamacare’ There doesn’t seem to be any ambiguity on this one. On his campaign website, Trump says ""On day one of the Trump Administration, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare."" ‘Build a great great wall’ Trump has made building a wall along the border with Mexico his signature initiative, and he hasn’t wavered. He has said it many times. In the course of interviews with the New York Times published May 4, 2016, he said within his first 100 days the wall would be designed, and there would be bilateral talks with Mexico, presumably on how they would pay for it -- another promise Trump has made. Establish ‘a deportation force’ There is no question that Trump called for teams to remove an estimated 11 million people who are in the country without authorization. The term itself goes back to an interview Trump gave on MSNBC in November 2015 when he said ""You’re going to have a deportation force. And you’re going to do it humanely."" We couldn’t find Trump promoting this again, although in the Feb. 25, 2016, Republican debate, he didn’t back away from the phrase. CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer teed up a question saying, ""Mr. Trump, you've called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States."" Trump prefaced his answer with a cut at his rivals for supporting amnesty and then said, ""We either have a country, or we don't have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out."" Trump has definitely committed to expanding the number of immigration and border control agents and to removing 11 million people. He hasn’t said if he would create a new deportation unit. While he might not be touting the same phrase, the result remains the same. ‘Ban Muslims from entering the country’ Immediately after the shootings by Muslim fundamentalists in San Bernardino in December 2015, the Trump campaign issued a statement saying, ""Donald Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on."" Within a few days, Trump said certain people would be exempted, including American citizens who are Muslim, foreign leaders, and athletes headed to competitions. However, according to the New York Times, within his first 100 days ""the immigration ban on Muslims would be in place."" That puts the ban firmly in the promise zone. ‘Kill the spouses and children of our enemies’ Trump said this during an interview on Fox and Friends, Dec. 2, 2015. ""The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families,"" Trump said. In an interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly, Trump seemed to dial down this threat. O’Reilly asked him if he would have killed members of the bin Laden family. Trump said ""I don't want to be so bold. I want to tell you they would suffer."" Trump was pressed on this at the Republican debate in Las Vegas on Dec. 15, 2015. Asked how this policy would set the United States apart from ISIS, Trump said, ""We have to be much tougher."" Trump finished his answer with, ""I would be very, very firm with families. Frankly, that will make people think because they may not care much about their lives, but they do care, believe it or not, about their families’ lives."" While this could be a death threat, it isn’t quite as clear as his original statement. Clearly, he wants to make family members suffer, but he doesn’t say how much. Restore waterboarding and ‘go further’ In the Republican debate right before the New Hampshire primary, Trump said, ""I would bring back waterboarding and I’d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding."" Trump stood by his waterboarding policy on March 22, 2016, telling CNN’s Wolf Blitzer he would ""go further."" Trump has also said that ""torture works."" The only caveat that Trump offered during his CNN interview is that he would listen to military officials’ advice on the use of interrogation methods. Whether a Trump administration would ever use waterboarding, he has promised to keep it on the table. Our ruling A Clinton campaign video listed eight steps Trump has promised to take as president. Five of those are firmly on the Trump agenda. That includes repealing Obamacare, building a wall along the Mexican border, deporting illegal immigrants, banning Muslims at the border, and restoring waterboarding and other torture techniques. On eliminating gun-free zones on school grounds, he hasn’t repeated it recently, but we saw no evidence he had changed his stance. There might be some debate over his plan to defund Planned Parenthood, because he links that to continued abortions. However, there is no indication that the group plans to stop providing that service, so a President Trump would need to cut funding if he wanted to keep his promise. The one exaggeration in the video is his threat to kill the families of terrorists. Trump seems to have backed off that promise. He has said he would make them suffer, not necessarily kill them. The video might miss a couple of nuances, but it is generally accurate. We rate the collective package Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a27d6e08-b5ec-40bb-aeb2-e15557be8d62",/factchecks/2016/may/05/hillary-clinton/clinton-video-lists-8-promises-trump-presidency/

Joe Biden says cervical cancer 'totally preventable' in Africa
","Vice President Joe Biden has called for a ""moonshot"" to cure cancer. The disease took his son in 2015, and now it has become his mission to eliminate some cancers and turn the rest into treatable, chronic diseases. Biden took his campaign to the Vatican where he said that ""nearly 50 percent of cancers are preventable."" ""Take cervical cancer --  530,000 new cases are diagnosed each year,"" Biden said. ""270,000 people die each year; 87 percent in developing countries. In Africa, it’s the second-most common cancer after breast cancer. It’s a travesty. But it’s fully preventable with basic education, screening, and vaccines."" Biden’s comment about cervical cancer in Africa caught our attention. Is cervical cancer fully preventable with the right interventions? A fact-sheet on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website tells us that Biden is almost but not quite right. ""Every year in the U.S., more than 12,000 women get cervical cancer, and 4,000 die from it. 93 percent of cervical cancer deaths could be prevented through screening and HPV vaccination."" Now, that is for the United States with a system of doctors, clinics and hospitals that far surpasses anything found in any African nation. If it’s not fully preventable here, it’s difficult to see why the results in Africa would be better. Beth Meyerson, a researcher at the School of Public Health at Indiana University is in the middle of a study on cervical cancer strategies in Africa. Meyerson told us ""Sub-Saharan Africa would not be able to achieve 100 percent prevention."" Meghan Dubyak, a Biden spokeswoman, said the vice president was trying to make a slightly different point. ""The vice president was referring to the travesty of cervical cancer being preventable,"" Dubyak said. To be sure, cervical cancer is highly preventable. The journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, says ""cervical cancer is a relatively rare disease in countries that have instituted and maintained national screening programs."" In this light, Biden’s statement draws attention to Africa’s unfortunate distinction. As this World Health Organization map shows, it is a hotspot worldwide for cervical cancer. In every dark blue country, the rate of new cases is over 30.2 per 100,000 women per year. By comparison, the rate in the United States is about 8.1 per 100,000 women per year. Of the 20 nations with the highest incidence of cervical cancer, 16 are in Sub-Saharan Africa. (Some researchers note there are vast gaps in this cancer data and say the true prevalence ""remains largely unknown."") A 2015 report from the Sub-Saharan African Cervical Cancer Working Group, a body of physicians, epidemiologists and cancer researchers, described the key reasons behind the reach of the disease. Screening is sorely lacking. The group found a ""lack of widespread services, delays in receiving results, lack of the high-quality laboratories needed for cytology based screening and absence of adequate centres for the evaluation and treatment of identified patients."" Dealing with cervical cancer exposes the many cracks in the health care systems across the region. Richard Wamai, assistant professor of public health at Northeastern University, said the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa are ill equipped for this challenge. ""Detection will require expanding the health service system, which requires investments in infrastructure,"" Wamai said. ""That calls for prioritization which is difficult to do because of competing health demands. Cancer in general is, to me, the most worrying of all other diseases for the continent. There is very little preparation and in many cases policy makers are not yet awoken to this impending tsunami."" Public health experts also say vaccination programs are essential. Some strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) can lead to cervical cancer and some of those strains can be blocked by vaccines. But just as Sub-Saharan countries lack the infrastructure for screening, they also lack a system for vaccinating young women. Speaking at a January 2016 event in Washington, Deborah Birx, U.S. Special Representative for Global Health Diplomacy, gave a bleak summary of the status of health care in Sub-Saharan Africa. ""There is no systematic health care for girls between the time they turn 5 and the time they get pregnant,"" Birx said. That age range would be key for any vaccination program. On top of that core challenge, Meyerson said the price tag for vaccines puts them out of reach. ""Many African countries find that the HPV vaccination cost is too high to have broad coverage,"" Meyerson said. Our ruling Biden said cervical cancer in Africa is ""fully preventable with basic education, screening, and vaccines."" The experience of the developed countries shows that nearly all deaths from cervical cancer could be eliminated with widespread screening and vaccination programs. Neither currently exist in Africa, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. We rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/may/05/joe-biden/biden-says-cervical-cancertotally-preventable-afri/

George Clooney: Bulk of the money collected at Clinton fundraiser will go to down-ballot Democrats
","Editor's note, May 4, 2016: We originally published this item on April 17 and rated it Mostly True. Since then, readers have contacted us to consider other evidence about the Democratic Party’s fundraising processes, especially state parties sending money back to the Democratic National Committee. We have updated and rerated this fact-check based on new information, changing the rating from Mostly True to Half True. You can read an archived version of the original report here.   You had to pay — or collect — as much as $353,000 per couple to attend recent fundraisers for Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, including one hosted at the home of actor George Clooney. After the affair drew protesters who support Bernie Sanders, Chuck Todd, host of NBC's Meet the Press, asked Clooney what happened when he encountered them. Clooney said he was accused of being a corporate shill, which is ""one of the funnier things you could say about me."" Then he told Todd, ""The overwhelming amount of money that we're raising, and it is a lot, but the overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising is not going to Hillary to run for president, it's going to the down-ticket. ""It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress. And the reason that's important (is) ... we need to take the Senate back because we need to confirm the Supreme Court justice, because that fifth vote on the Supreme Court can overturn Citizens United and get this obscene, ridiculous amount of money out so I never have to do a fundraiser again. And that's why I'm doing it."" Here, we’re fact-checking Clooney’s claim, ""The overwhelming amount of money that we're raising, and it is a lot, but the overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising is not going to Hillary to run for president … It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress."" What we found is that Clooney is technically accurate about most of the money not going to Clinton’s campaign, but it’s not necessarily going to ""congressmen and senators."" Clooney is right about the direct support for Clinton’s presidential campaign. Federal law says individuals can't give more than $2,700 to a presidential candidate's primary campaign. Another $2,700 can be collected for the general election. It doesn't matter whether you give it directly or a friend collects it from you on the candidate's behalf, the limit is there. Where the rest of those big-dollar donations end up is a bit of a maze. We’ll try to walk you through it. In this case, the Clinton California fundraisers were held on behalf of the Hillary Victory Fund, which distributes the money to Clinton's campaign committee, Hillary for America. But it also distributes money to the Democratic National Committee and the state parties. A donor can also give up to $33,400 a year to the DNC and $10,000 a year to each of the state parties for use in getting its candidates elected to federal office. If you do the math, with 32 state parties included in the Victory Fund, that's $356,100. The state parties generally are tasked with helping elect Democrats at the state level, and the DNC does the same at the national level. The way the donations are divided is explained at the bottom of the Hillary Victory Fund page on the Clinton website. The first $2,700 goes to Clinton, the next $33,400 goes to the DNC and the rest goes to state parties. How does this translate into total donations for each group? If you look at the money going out, which is available through campaign finance reports, it looks like Clinton is getting most of the money. According to the Center for Responsive Politics by the end of 2015, the Hillary Victory Fund had given $4.4 million to Clinton, $2.3 million to the DNC, and $2.2 to state political parties. That makes Clinton's share through 2015 almost exactly 50 percent. In the first quarter of this year, Clinton's share was 63 percent of the money that was officially spent on campaigns. Politico reported that the fund also spent $6.7 million for ""online ads that mostly looked like Clinton campaign ads, as well as $5.5 million on direct marketing."" The Clinton campaign gets the lion's share of the money collected by the Victory Fund, said Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin, because most of the donors give much smaller amounts, and everything up to $2,700 per person is earmarked to go to Hillary for America first. It's when a donor exceeds that limit that the excess spills over to benefit the national and state Democratic committees. Or — in the case of the state parties — that's how it appears on paper. Federal Election Commission records show that in most cases, the money given to the state parties has been immediately redirected to the DNC. The money isn't staying with the states at all. On May 2, Politico published a story reporting that 88 percent of the state money was immediately passed along to the DNC. In some cases, the state parties didn't even know the money had gone in and out of their accounts until after the fact. The Hillary Victory Fund sent $214,100 to Minnesota, for example, and that state party didn't keep a dime. It was routed to the DNC, which otherwise wouldn’t have been able to accept the money ""since it came from donors who had mostly had already maxed out to the national party committee,"" Politico reported. We contacted the DNC and the Clinton campaign to try to understand what was compelling the states to immediately send funds back to the DNC. We couldn’t get straight answers. The Clinton campaign provided a copy of the agreement with the state parties, but it contains no language requiring such a transfer. Although DNC spokesman Luis Miranda said that the terms of the agreement called for states to send the money to the DNC for election infrastructure, Clinton spokesman Schwerin was emphatic that the state committees were free to keep whatever money they wanted. However, a Feb. 20 Washington Post story on Clinton's fundraising efforts says the executive director of Utah's Democratic party said state party officials understood they were supposed to send back money to DNC headquarters. So if money is going back to the DNC, what’s it being spent on? The overarching response of both the Clinton campaign and the DNC was that the money being diverted to the DNC was, in fact, being used to help local Democrats get elected. Those candidates need voter information, research, media monitoring, organizing capacity and other infrastructure services provided by the DNC to run a successful campaign, and that's how the money was being used. However, such services also benefit the Clinton campaign. ""The process Hillary Victory is using has been common practice for a number of years,"" said Bob Biersack, senior fellow at the Center for Responsive Politics. ""The states always agree because they have no choice. Transferring the money back to the national party is a condition of participating. They do it in hopes of getting some good will from the national party down the road."" As for the degree to which the system really helps House and Senate candidates, Biersack said there isn't a precise answer. He noted that the party's congressional committees aren't party to the deal. ""If the goal was to support those campaigns, surely the national organizations most responsible would be participants. Traditionally the DNC and RNC are taken over by their presidential nominees during the election year, and the first priority for every spending decision is how it relates to the presidential race,"" he said. ""If that campaign were to become significantly less competitive, then the national party might well move to other races, but it would happen in that sequence and in those conditions."" One final important note: Spokesmen for both the Clinton campaign and the DNC said many millions raised for the state parties have not been distributed yet, but will be soon. Our ruling Clooney said, ""The overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising, is not going to Hillary to run for president. ... It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress."" Clooney is correct that most of the big-dollar donations in question are not going to Clinton’s campaign for president. By law, they can’t. Whether the money is ""going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress"" is a much different story. Most of the money appears to be winding up at the DNC, not state parties, as individual donors may have expected. The national party says that money is being used on campaign infrastructure that will benefit House and Senate candidates. But it will benefit Clinton, too. Clooney’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.  ",/factchecks/2016/may/05/george-clooney/george-clooney-decries-big-money-politics-says-mos/

Bernie Sanders says minimum wage hike to $15 would reduce federal assistance by $7.6 billion a year
","Though he’s significantly trailing Hillary Clinton in the Democratic delegate count, Bernie Sanders is keeping up the pressure on his primary rival, particularly on policy grounds. In a tweet sent on May 4, 2016 -- the day after Sanders won the Indiana primary -- Sanders reminded followers about his stance on the minimum wage, which is more aggressive than Clinton’s. Sanders supports raising the wage to $15 an hour, while Clinton has backed a raise to $12 an hour. (Currently, it’s $7.25 an hour.) ""Increasing the min. wage to $15 an hour would reduce spending on food stamps, public housing and other programs by over $7.6 billion a year,"" Sanders tweeted. Is that correct? Not really. Sanders’ tweet rests on an analysis of increasing the minimum wage to $10.10, not to $15. In reality, economists have never modeled potential job losses caused by increasing the minimum wage to $15, which would be more than double the current level. In fact, some suggest that raising the minimum wage that high could produce enough job losses to increase -- not decrease -- public assistance costs.  The source of Sanders’ statistic The number comes from the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank, based on a minimum wage hike to $10.10. ""Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would reduce government expenditures on current income-support programs by $7.6 billion per year -- and possibly more, given the conservative nature of this estimate,"" EPI wrote. The author of the EPI paper, David Cooper, told PolitiFact that he and his colleagues did subsequently re-run the numbers -- not for a $15 minimum wage but for a $12 minimum wage. Their conclusion was that a bump to $12 would save an even higher amount than a bump to $10.10 -- specifically, $17 billion annually. So Sanders’ tweet, Cooper said, could actually be ""an understatement."" But even if you agree with that argument -- and many economists would not -- changing the calculation to a $15 minimum wage could make a big difference. Even Cooper acknowledged that there’s a degree of uncertainty about the impacts of a minimum wage hike as large as the one Sanders was referring to, if only because it hasn’t been studied. ""I don't think we know definitively whether $15 would be different, because it is larger than the increases that have been rigorously studied,"" Cooper said. However, he added, ""If you think $15 would have some sizable negative effect on employment or hours, it's going to moderate those savings (on government assistance programs). We have no way to know by how much."" Economists are skeptical Other economists we checked with expressed even deeper skepticism. They said that even if you accept research that says modest minimum-wage increases don’t depress employment -- which, again, is a claim not all economists agree with -- it’s unwise to blithely assume that an increase to $15 will have no negative impact on hiring and hours worked. For instance, in 2014, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that an increase of the minimum wage from $7.25 to $9.00 would result in the loss of 100,000 jobs. But a rise to $10.10, CBO estimated, would swell that number fivefold, to 500,000. Scaling that calculation up to a $15 minimum wage would almost certainly increase net job losses further, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. ""It’s very hard to believe that a minimum wage hike to $15 would produce the same adverse impact on employment as a hike to just $10.10,"" Burtless said. Indeed, the potential adverse impacts are ""likely to be considerably bigger"" at $15, he said. Others agreed. ""A larger hike is more likely to cause a decrease in employment opportunities, and that could result in an increase in the demands for government support rather than a decrease,"" said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University and the jobs site Indeed. Jonathan Meer, a Texas A&M University economist agreed. ""These estimates are predicated on the notion that the minimum wage is a simple transfer from employers to employees, with no negative effects on employment,"" he said. ""The higher the minimum wage goes, the worse of an assumption that is."" What the Sanders camp says When we reached out to the Sanders campaign, they forwarded two supporting documents. One was a letter from 210 economists backing a minimum wage hike to $15 an hour. However, even this letter acknowledges that ""raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour as of 2020 would entail an increase that is significantly above the typical pattern with federal minimum wage increases."" The second was a study from the University of Washington that found little or no evidence of price increases at grocery, retail, or gasoline stores in Seattle relative to the surrounding areas after that city raised its minimum wage. However, while Seattle’s wage is eventually heading to $15, it has not reached that level yet, and the study only looked at the period after the wage increased from $9.47 to $11. That’s a jump of $1.53, not $7.75 -- the size of the federal increase if Sanders had his way. The authors of the University of Washington paper acknowledge this. ""We have little reason to think that our initial impact assessment will adequately capture the full impact of the minimum wage ordinance,"" they wrote. ""As some employers will have until 2021 to fully adapt to higher wages, the complete impact of the $15 minimum wage in Seattle may not be known for nearly a decade."" One of the authors, University of Washington public policy professor Jacob L. Vigdor, told PolitiFact that ""it's fair to say that we don't have evidence to support the public spending claim"" made by Sanders. Our ruling Sanders tweeted, ""Increasing the min. wage to $15 an hour would reduce spending on food stamps, public housing and other programs by over $7.6 billion a year."" Sanders based this on a study that looked at what would happen if the minimum wage were raised to $10.10, not to $15. In reality, no such study of a $15 wage hike exists -- and economists say there’s good reason to believe that jobs lost from a wage hike that large could be significant. It might even be big enough to increase the cost of government assistance, not lower it. At the very least, a minimum wage increase this big is historically unprecedented, meaning that the degree of certainty in Sanders’ tweet is unsupported by academic evidence. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/may/05/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-minimum-wage-hike-15-would-red/

Pat McCrory says Springsteen canceled North Carolina show after poor ticket sales
","Gov. Pat McCrory took shots at critics of North Carolina’s controversial new law, commonly known as HB2, during a morning radio appearance May 3 on The John Boy and Billy Big Show. The law banned transgender people from using the bathroom of the gender they identify as, banned cities from enacting their own minimum wages or LGBT-friendly discrimination laws and got rid of anyone’s ability to file a discrimination lawsuit in state court. It was widely panned by progressive politicians as well as entertainers, some of whom even canceled shows in the Tar Heel State. On the show McCrory, with encouragement from John Boy and Billy, went through a laundry list of critics he said were mistaken or hypocritical. The show’s titular hosts – two down-home comedians with a conservative bent – are based in Charlotte and are broadcast in the morning rush hour throughout the country, primarily on rock stations. So it was no surprise that Bruce Springsteen’s name was brought up – although it was McCrory, not the hosts, who broached the subject of the rocker who is arguably the biggest name to have canceled a show in North Carolina over the new law. ""Some things are more important than a rock show, and this fight against prejudice and bigotry – which is happening as I write – is one of them,"" Springsteen wrote April 8 in announcing the decision to cancel his April 10 show. McCrory, however, implied that perhaps The Boss doesn’t command the adoration he once did – and that his cancellation was actually a ploy to avoid the embarrassing optics of a half-empty concert. ""I love Bruce Springsteen,"" McCrory said. ""I love his music. But he canceled a concert in Greensboro. By the way, they only had 8,000 tickets sold, with all respect. Hmm. But Bruce doesn’t mention that. They didn’t get the ticket sales they wanted."" That got a hearty laugh from everyone on set, and McCrory later repeated that 8,000 number. Where'd he hear that? Here at PolitiFact North Carolina, we’ve seen our fair share of videos from Springsteen’s live shows (mostly to marvel at Nils Lofgren’s guitar solos). The crowds are always sizeable, if not sold out. We would be quite surprised if Springsteen had sold only half the tickets to his Greensboro show just two days before the concert. The Greensboro Coliseum, where he had been scheduled to play, can seat more than 20,000 people. Stadium officials said the capacity for the Springsteen concert was actually about 16,000 due to stage and seating logistics. So that 8,000 number, if true, would say a lot about Springsteen – especially keeping in mind that the Coliseum tracks attendance for all of its shows, and Bruuuuuuuuuuuce has two of the 20 largest crowds in stadium history. But those were years ago, in 2002 and 2009. Is McCrory right that North Carolinians in 2016 don’t care much for the Jersey rocker’s music, much less his liberal views? Was he really only using a convenient political stance to cover up embarrassing sales numbers? No, according to the Greensboro Coliseum. Andrew Brown, the arena’s PR director, told us Springsteen had sold more than 15,000 tickets. ""No idea where 8,000 may have come from,"" Brown said, adding that there were fewer than 100 tickets left when Springsteen canceled with two days’ notice. ""It’s safe to say it would have sold out,"" he said. Like Brown, we also have no idea where the 8,000 number came from. McCrory’s campaign hasn’t responded to our questions, but we’ll update this if we hear back. The Greensboro Coliseum previously reported that Springsteen’s cancellation cost it $100,000. Pearl Jam, Ringo Starr, Demi Lovato/Nick Jonas and Ani DiFranco have also canceled, while such acts as Jimmy Buffett, Beyonce and Mumford & Sons have played but spoken out against the law from on stage or in written statements. As for Springsteen, the more-than-15,000-tickets number is the same figure the coliseum reported immediately after the cancellation, which was weeks before McCrory questioned the attendance. We appreciate the consistency, which keeps us from dancing in the dark to try to figure out the truth. Our ruling McCrory was way off on the number of tickets sold, which was widely reported before his radio appearance. What's more, he used that incorrect number to suggest that was why Springsteen canceled. In fact, the arena said the show was on the verge of selling out, not half empty. That’s not just false – ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, it’s on fire. Pants on Fire! UPDATE: McCrory apologizes The night after our fact-check went up, we heard back from Pat McCrory’s office about his claim that only 8,000 tickets had been sold. Although he’s standing by another claim he made – that he loves Springsteen’s music – McCrory admitted he was wrong about the sales figure and that it was the reason for the cancellation. ""The governor apologizes for using the wrong number,"" wrote his spokesman, Josh Ellis, in an email to PolitiFact North Carolina. ""It’s too bad Bruce Springsteen actually canceled on nearly 15,000 people at the last minute. Regardless, the governor is still keeping his Springsteen albums despite their political disagreements."" https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8810b36b-ac00-4caf-bcc4-42e9dba89087",/factchecks/2016/may/04/pat-mccrory/pat-mccrory-says-springsteen-canceled-north-caroli/

Report says ColoradoCare would have higher revenues than McDonald’s
","An independent analysis says Colorado's proposed universal health care system would have $38 billion in projected revenues -- dwarfing Fortune 500 companies like McDonald's, Nike and American Express. The report, by the Colorado Health Institute, is a primer on the potential benefits and drawbacks of ColoradoCare, a proposed state health care cooperative that would resemble single-payer health care systems like those in Canada and Europe. Coloradans will decide whether to create the giant system when they vote on Amendment 69 in the November election. ""Supporters estimate ColoradoCare would have $38 billion in annual revenues,"" the report states. ""If it were a private company, ColoradoCare would rank about 80th in the Fortune 500, just behind New York Life Insurance and ahead of well­-known companies such as American Express, 21st Century Fox, 3M, Sears, Nike and McDonald's."" Need more perspective? Colorado's annual state budget is $25.7 billion. We examined the statement that ColoradoCare’s projected revenues would be $38 billion and overshadow huge corporates. We found that the number is right in theory, but it depends on the federal government signing off on a first-of-its-kind health system for Colorado. How ColoradoCare would work First, here’s how ColoradoCare would work. If approved by voters, Colorado would be the first state to have a health care system where every resident has coverage financed by taxes instead of private insurance premiums, according to the Colorado Health Institute report. The institute estimates that 83 percent of Colorado’s population -- about 4.4 million people -- would be eligible for primary health insurance coverage through ColoradoCare. The remaining 17 percent of residents would continue to be covered by federal programs, including Medicare and the Veterans Administration. People would still choose their own health care providers, but ColoradoCare would pay the bills. Members would not have to pay an annual deductible, but they would have co-pays. The system would be controlled by a powerful 21-member board, elected by the system’s members in seven districts across the state. The governor and legislature would have no role, except to select an interim board until elections were held.   An economic analysis by supporters says ColoradoCare would produce a net savings of $4.5 billion for residents and businesses by eliminating private insurance profits, streamlining paperwork and more efficiently delivering services. Opponents say the proposed amendment will be costly, it won't impact rising health care costs and it will hamper the state’s ability to attract and retain medical providers. The ColoradoCareYes campaign confirmed the proposed nonprofit health system is projected to have $38 billion in annual revenues. About $25 billion would come from state taxes. Employers would pay 6.67 percent in payroll taxes and employees would contribute 3.33 percent, for a total of 10 percent of the payroll. Self-employed people would pay 10 percent of their net income. The projected $25 billion in tax revenues have been independently confirmed by an economist at the Colorado Legislative Council, which provided a revenue impact report to the state board that reviews the language and legality of an initiative's ballot title and summary. For the rest of its annual revenues, supporters say ColoradoCare would apply for waivers from the federal government, so that ColoradoCare takes over the state roles and funding for Medicaid ($10.8 billion) and the Affordable Care Act ($700 million). Out-of-pocket costs for medical care and dental care would each provide an estimated $1 billion. But experts said obtaining the federal waivers is a challenging process -- and there’s no certainty of success. Beginning on Jan. 1, states can apply for a federal waiver to create innovative, alternative health care programs that would take the place of the Affordable Care Act -- while staying true to its goals. ColoradoCare would have to pass a rigorous federal review, showing it would deliver coverage that's at least as comprehensive and affordable as the so-called Obamacare program, while covering the same amount of people. ColoradoCare would have to stay ""revenue neutral"" and not cost more than the existing federal program. Federal waivers, funding ‘not a sure thing’ What are the chances of obtaining the waivers and the federal funds that go with them? ""Definitely, I would say it’s not a sure thing,"" said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, who specializes in health care reform, an issue she worked on for both the administrations of President Barack Obama and President Bill Clinton. Yet, if approved by voters, ColoradoCare would be among the first states to seek an Affordable Care Act (ACA) waiver and bring ""the most far-reaching health care reform in any state since the ACA,"" according to the Colorado Health Institute report. ""There's advantages for being the first one in the door. It lets you kind of establish the framework for the debate that's going follow,"" Pollitz said. Medicaid waivers aren’t automatic, either, though several states, including Colorado, have received the so-called 1115 waivers -- named for a Section 1115 of the Social Security Act ""1115 waivers require a lot of work and back-and-forth between the state and the federal government and compliance with a number of criteria, including budget neutrality,"" said Elisabeth Arenales, the health care program director for the Colorado Center on Law and Policy. The center hasn't reviewed or taken a position on Amendment 69. ""States have to be careful in how they negotiate those waivers because they're essentially locked into a spending contract, and they need to be very mindful that they're both not costing the federal government any additional money but also that their projections of state spending are accurate,"" Arenales said.  The ballot initiative’s language makes it clear that getting the waivers are a do-or-die matter for ColoradoCare. No waivers means no program. Under the heading ""Termination of ColoradoCare’s Operations,"" the initiative states: ""If the board determines that ColoradoCare has not received the waivers, exemptions, and agreements from the federal government sufficient for its fiscally sound operation, the board shall: (a) shut down operations and return unused funds; (b) notify the governor of the State of Colorado of ColoradoCare's inability to function."" ColoradoCareYES campaign spokesman Owen Perkins acknowledged the waivers’ critical importance. ""ColoradoCare doesn't move forward without that,"" he said. But, at the same time, he said it should be reassuring to Colorado voters that health care system couldn’t launch until it passes a high bar set by the federal government. ""I think everybody in Colorado should be thankful that there is that vigorous standard,"" Perkins said. ""That ensures that we can't go into this willy-nilly. It could pass with a 75-percent vote and everything look perfect, but if it doesn't receive that waiver, it's not going to happen.""   He stressed that the architects of ColoradoCare have done their homework. The Colorado Health Institute is accurate in saying, given ColoradoCare’s projected $38 billion in revenues, if it were a private company is would rank about 80th on the Fortune 500 just behind New York Life Insurance ($38.7 billion in revenues). It’s revenues would be larger than American Express  ($35.9 billion), Twenty-First Century Fox ($31.86 billion), 3M ($31.82 billion), Sears ($31.2 billion), Nike ($27.8 billion) and McDonald’s ($27.4 billion). On paper, the ColoradoCareYES campaign’s projected state tax and federal funding revenues add up to $38 billion. Our ruling The Colorado Health Institute analysis said the Colorado universal health care system would have a projected $38 billion in revenues, larger than major corporations. The numbers seem to add up if everything with ColoradoCare goes according to its supporters’ plans. The revenues would be larger than some big companies. However, the health care plan has a make-or-break need to obtain federal waivers that would allow it to assume the roles of state Medicaid and Affordable Care Act programs. No waivers means no deal. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/aa4fc618-f92d-4df5-8f96-8cced5a8bbb1",/factchecks/2016/may/04/colorado-health-institute/report-says-coloradocare-would-have-higher-revenue/
