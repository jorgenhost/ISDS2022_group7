Republicans mislead in ad linking Bill Nelson to Elizabeth Warren on single payer
","Republicans are attempting to link U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party that has pushed for single-payer health care. A Facebook ad by the National Republican Senatorial Committee ties Nelson, D-Fla., to U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. ""Elizabeth Warren doesn't think Obamacare goes far enough,"" states the Facebook ad, which started July 5. Then it quotes Warren saying ""the next step is single payer."" The text on the screen continues: ""Does Sen. Nelson agree? He has in the past ... Sen. Nelson votes with Warren 90 percent of the time. Tell Sen. Nelson no to government health care!"" Republicans are targeting Nelson because he faces re-election in 2018 in a state won by President Donald Trump and he is likely to face Republican Gov. Rick Scott, a key advocate of repealing the Affordable Care Act. In June, Warren told the Wall Street Journal that Democrats should run on single payer in 2018. It’s possible to view the ad and get the impression that Nelson has supported single payer, a system in which government would provide health care coverage for everyone similar to Canada. A spokeswoman for the NRSC disagreed with that interpretation. She said that the line is a reference to Nelson agreeing with Warren on a majority of votes. The NRSC’s press release announcing the ad raises the question if Nelson will ""support Warren’s socialized health care plan."" ""It’s a fair question, seeing Warren is advocating for Democrats up in 2018 to run on single payer,"" Katie Martin, NRSC spokeswoman, told PolitiFact. We’ll examine the ad’s entire text and issue an overall rating. Nelson has scarcely mentioned ""single payer"" at all in the years leading up to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, or even since that time. At an October 2005 speech to the Tiger Bay Club of St. Petersburg, the Tampa Tribune paraphrased Nelson’s answer to a question about health care. The Tribune wrote that Nelson said he opposed a universal, single-payer health care program, but that employers should not be the main source of health insurance for individuals. Large groups of consumers organized into purchasing units should replace employers as group insurance purchasers, he said. Some Democrats pushed for a single-payer system leading up to the passage of the Affordable Care Act. (There was a time when Barack Obama supported it, too.) But there wasn’t enough support for that route. In the summer of 2009, Nelson said little about the pending legislation, drawing heat from some Democratic activists. By the fall, he sounded cautiously supportive and called the bill a ""starting point."" Nelson actually pushed back against those who said the health proposal would end up turning into single payer. For example, during a Senate Committee on Finance markup of the bill on Sept. 29, 2009, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, argued that ""the government plan will eventually lead us to a de facto single-payer system of health care."" Nelson disagreed with Grassley’s conclusion. ""Now you just made a statement that it will lead to a single payer. How in the world do you make that leap?"" Nelson said. Nelson’s office declined to comment for this fact-check; however, on the day the NRSC ad appeared, Nelson addressed the question of his view on single payer while meeting with college students in Orlando. ""When people say, ‘Are you for single payer,’ I’m having enough trouble right now just keeping the ACA,"" Nelson said. ""America is not ready for single payer, but America is ready — and has — the ACA. People are trying to take that away and take health care away from 22 million people."" Nelson has said he would not vote for the Republican’s Senate health care plan and has called for bipartisan fixes. The legislation has failed to garner sufficient Republican support to proceed. The NRSC sent us a screengrab of CQ data showing a comparison of Warren’s voting record with Nelson’s record between January 2013 and June 27, 2017. The data shows that Nelson and Warren voted the same way on 1,126 votes out of 1,250, or 90 percent. The fact that members of the same party agree with each other on issues that reach a vote isn’t a surprise in an increasingly partisan atmosphere. However, the issues that reach a vote don’t tell the full story about a senator’s beliefs, University of Miami political science professor Gregory Koger said. ""The Senate votes on a carefully selected sort of issues, biased toward extremely conservative ideas (to mollify Ted Cruz types), consensus proposals, or middle-of-the-road Democratic proposals,"" Koger said. ""Indeed, one of the reasons the Senate has been dysfunctional is that both parties fight hard to keep many issues from coming to a roll call vote."" Voting together on a carefully screened set of issues does not imply agreement on controversial proposals. The NRSC said, ""Elizabeth Warren doesn't think Obamacare goes far enough: 'The next step is single payer.' Does Sen. Nelson agree? He has in the past ... Sen. Nelson votes with Warren 90 percent of the time."" The ad suggests that Nelson supports Warren on most things, including a single-payer health care system. Actually, Nelson has said he doesn’t support single payer and wants to focus on preserving current law. His voting record is similar to Warren’s, but members of the same party increasingly vote alike due to a lack of bipartisan votes in the Senate. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/jul/19/national-republican-senatorial-committee/republicans-mislead-ad-linking-bill-nelson-elizabe/

Joe Straus says Austin school district expected to lose $530-million-plus to fund other schools
","Texas House Speaker Joe Straus hinted at the Texas House’s derailed push for more state education aid by asserting that absent fresh action, Austin taxpayers can count on ponying up more than half a billion dollars to schools in other places this year. The San Antonio Republican prefaced his Austin-centric claim by rehashing his view that Texas overly relies on property taxes to fund the schools. ""Property taxes are going up, and more and more of those dollars are going to school districts in other parts of the state through the Robin Hood system,"" Straus said in an email blast distributed two days before the July 2017 special session called by Gov. Greg Abbott. Straus elaborated: ""School districts are expected to send away $2 billion through Robin Hood in the upcoming year. One district alone -- Austin ISD -- is expected to lose more than $530 million in local property taxes to Robin Hood this year."" Is that accurate? Straus was referring to the Robin Hood or ""recapture"" facet of state law designed for equalization purposes so districts with rich tax bases share revenue with less property-wealthy districts. In July 2017,  before Straus made his claim, the Texas Education Agency said that some $2 billion all told would be redistributed via the share-the-wealth mechanism in 2017-18. In 2016, we found True a claim by Travis County state Sen. Kirk Watson that in Austin, ""the average homeowner is paying about $1,300 to $1,400 just for recapture."" That fact-check said the district for 2016-17 would be forwarding more than $400 million for schools elsewhere. Straus cites newspaper Asked how Straus reached the larger $530-million figure, a Straus spokesman, Jason Embry, said by email that Straus relied on a June 19, 2017, Austin American-Statesman news story about the Austin district’s board of trustees approving a nearly $1.5 billion budget for 2017-18. The story said the district’s recapture payment ""this year is expected to be $534 million, an increase of 32 percent, or $127.8 million, over 2016-17."" It quoted Nicole Conley, the district’s chief financial officer, saying the district expects to pay more than $1 billion in recapture payments ""during the next two years."" Austin school district’s calculation When we reached out to the district, spokeswoman Cristina Nguyen specified that according to calculations taking into account expected student enrollment and tax collections, Austin’s estimated payments would total $533,874,730 for the 2017-18 school year. She emailed us the district’s calculations, viewable here. Another district spokeswoman, Tiffany Young, sent an email pointing out a May 2017 district chart suggesting its recapture payments could top $800 million by the 2020-21 school year: SOURCE: Document, ""FY2018 Recommended Budget,"" Austin Independent School District, May 2017 (web link received by email from Tiffany Young, senior communication specialist, AISD, July 17, 2017) State’s preliminary analysis We also asked the Texas Education Agency how much the Austin district will be expected to forward in ""recapture"" money in 2017-18. By email, Lauren Callahan guided us to an agency estimate, last updated June 21, 2017, of $513,633,317. That’s $20 million less than the district’s announced estimate. But Callahan also cautioned that the state figure is preliminary and likely to increase depending on the district’s tax rate. Callahan wrote: ""We use different estimates of local property tax collections as well as different estimates of student counts, both of which affect the estimate of recapture. Our numbers tie together when all final data is reconciled."" Our ruling Straus said the Austin district ""is expected to lose more than $530 million in local property taxes to Robin Hood this year."" As of May 2017, the Austin district estimated that in 2017-18 it would flow nearly $534 million in local property tax revenue through the state’s school finance system, nicknamed Robin Hood, to help equalize school funding across the state.

Evan Smith incorrectly says last Anglo-majority Texas high-school class graduated in 2014
","Stressing the changing population of Texas, the Texas Tribune’s CEO pinpointed 2014 as a milestone year perhaps troubling to historically dominant residents. As quoted in The New Yorker magazine, Evan Smith noted first that the Republican-led Legislature this year allocated a fresh $800 million toward border security. ""White people are scared of change,"" Smith went on, ""believing that what they have is being taken away from them by people they consider unworthy. ""But all they’re doing is poking a bear with a stick,"" Smith told Lawrence Wright for an extensive July 2017 story on Texas government and politics. ""In 2004, the Anglo population in Texas became a minority. The last majority-Anglo high-school class in Texas graduated in 2014. There will never be another. The reality is, it’s all over for the Anglos."" Whether anything is over, for anyone, strikes us as a factually uncheckable opinion. It’s otherwise old news that Anglo, or white, residents haven’t made up the majority of Texans for a while. But did the last majority-white high school class graduate as recently as 2014? A reader asked us to check Smith’s 2014 claim, noting it could be read to mean there are no longer any high schools where white students make up a majority of graduates. Asked about that notion, Rice University’s Steve Murdock, former director of the U.S. Census Bureau, told us by email: ""There are of course schools where this is not true such as some suburban schools and some rural schools in the Panhandle and other areas where the residents are still disproportionately non-Hispanic white."" For our part, we checked regional figures for high school completion in 2015, the latest year of state-posted data. That year, white students comprised more than half of high-school seniors and graduates in East Texas (Education Service Center regions rooted in Huntsville, Mt. Pleasant and Kilgore) and the Wichita Falls and Abilene areas of West Texas. Across Texas, in contrast, some 109,200 white students made up 32 percent of the state’s 339,026 12th-graders and 102,000 white graduates accounted for 34 percent of the state’s total 302,262 graduates, the figures indicate. Separately, Smith told us by email that he wasn’t trying to tell Wright there are no longer any white-majority senior classes in the state. Asked why he specified 2014 as a statewide turning point, Smith said he believes he relied on information from Murdock or possibly the Texas Education Agency. State data Next, we asked the education agency about Smith’s claim. Spokeswoman Lauren Callahan pointed us toward agency-posted high-school completion data indicating that the last time white students comprised even a plurality of the state’s public high-school graduates was 2010. That year, according to the data, there were 109,887 white high-school graduates and 106,514 Hispanic graduates -- though the state’s 135,212 Hispanic high school seniors (not all of them graduating) outnumbered the 119,938 white seniors. Back in time In our subsequent review of agency figures, we didn’t spot a recent year when white students comprised a majority of seniors or graduates. As far back as 2003, 125,262 white high-school seniors amounted to 47.5 percent of all the state’s 263,571 seniors, according to the agency. In 2015, the latest year of posted counts, 109,200 white seniors comprised 32.2 percent of 339,626 seniors. With help from Lloyd Potter, the San Antonio-based Texas state demographer, we looked further back. Potter pointed out TEA reports on enrollment including a 2003 report stating that in 2000-01, 111,781 white students accounted for 50.7 percent of the state’s 220,324 high school seniors and in 2001-02, 113,108 white students broke out to a smidge more than half of the state’s 226,177 12th-graders. In 2002-03, 117,100 white seniors comprised 49 percent of the state’s 238,699 seniors, the agency later reported. Notably, Smith was more specific by declaring 2014 the last time white students comprised the majority of high-school graduates. According to the TEA’s counts, in contrast, white students most recently comprised the majority of Texas public high school graduates in 2003. That year, the agency says, 112,460 Anglo students made up 50.7 percent of the state’s 222,021 graduates. The next year, agency figures indicate, 112,495 white students made up 49.1 percent of the state’s 229,133 graduates. We circled back to Smith with these date findings. He said of his quoted claim: ""If it’s wrong, it’s wrong."" Our ruling Smith said the last majority-Anglo high school class in Texas graduated in 2014. To the contrary, there remain some Texas high schools with a majority of white students in 12th grade or among graduates, we found, while for all of Texas, state-collected counts show the latest year that white students comprised the majority of public high-school graduates was 2003. White students last accounted for the majority of public high-school seniors in 2001-02. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Lt. Gov. Cagle says Georgia is No. 1 state for business. Is it?
","Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle has pitched his candidacy for Georgia governor as a promise to maintain Georgia’s reputation as one of the most business-friendly states in the country. ""Keep Georgia the No. 1 state to do business,"" the Republican's campaign website says. ""There is no doubt. When you look today, for four years in a row we are the No. 1 state to do business in, and there is room to grow,"" Cagle told small-business owners in Thomasville, Ga., June 22, according to WALB news. Is that true? In saying Georgia is the No. 1 state to do business, Cagle was citing a list put together by Site Selection, a magazine that specializes in business relocation and expansion, campaign spokesman Joseph Hendricks told us. Site Selection said Georgia had the best business climate in the country for the fourth year in a row. As evidence of Georgia’s success, the Site Selection article pointed to growth in foreign direct investment and the film, health and auto industries. It also listed several major corporations that have recently decided to expand in Georgia: athletic shoes manufacturer Adidas, health benefits company Anthem, diversified technology company Honeywell, and tire manufacturer Sentury Tire. Site Selection is the ""go-to magazine for site selection professionals,"" said Jeff Humphreys, director of the Simon S. Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia Terry College of Business. Cagle is far from the only Georgia official to reference the Site Selection ranking. It's been touted by the Georgia Department of Economic Development, Gov. Nathan Deal and the Georgia Chamber of Commerce.  Site Selection is a credible source, experts told us — but they added it’s not the only one. Among the better-known and respected rankings, CNBC places Georgia second, while Forbes places it seventh. Those aren’t first-place rankings, but they’re still pretty high. Other credible rankings, though, have Georgia lower. The Beacon Hill Institute for Public Policy Research, for instance, placed Georgia 24th. Indeed, when researchers at Ball State University created a composite score for each state using a number of these best-state-for-business rankings, their measure placed Georgia No. 15 in 2016. That’s basically in the top one-third of states. ""The problem with rankings always lies in the factors they include,"" said John E. Gnuschke, director of the Sparks Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Memphis. ""No standard scale exists for saying that one state is better."" The Site Selection methodology gives half its weight to a survey of corporate site selectors, and the other half to an index of seven metrics, including facility locations and expansions, total projects, and tax burdens. ""This topic is an enormous can of methodological worms,"" said Lee McPheters, an economist at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. As researchers at Arizona State University noted in a 2014 report, the list of factors important in siting a headquarters or research and development facility ""can be quite different from the most important factors in locating a manufacturing plant or some other type of facility."" In addition, experts said, the question of how much weight to give to low business taxes and regulation ultimately owes something to a value judgment about what’s important. Michael Leeds, who chairs the economics department at Temple University, cautioned that ""the best place ‘to do business’ is not always the best place to work."" Cagle, talking about his state of Georgia, said, ""for four years in a row, we are the No. 1 state to do business in."" A well-regarded business magazine, Site Selection, has listed Georgia as its best state for business for the past four years. But that’s just one publication’s ranking; others offered different ratings, and it’s impossible to say that one methodology is the perfect one. Cagle's statement is partially accurate.

"['Health Care', 'Wisconsin', 'Ron Johnson']","
Johnson mostly on target with claim on out-of-pocket health costs
","Amid it all, Johnson has been adamant that spending on health care must come down. In a June 4, 2017, interview on WKOW-TV’s Capital City Sunday, which included discussion on Republican efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Johnson said this: ""In the ‘40s, 68 cents of every health care dollar was actually paid for by the patient. Today it’s only 11 cents. So nobody cares really what they pay for anything, which is why costs run out of control."" That’s a big difference in costs. Is Johnson right about the big change in the percentage of health care costs paid directly by the patient? A history lesson According to a May 2008 article in the American Medical Association Journal of Ethics, medical care in the early 1900s wasn’t much of a system. ""Health care was virtually unregulated and health insurance, nonexistent,"" the article said. ""Physicians practiced and treated patients in their homes. The few hospitals that existed provided minimal therapeutic care. Both physicians and hospitals were unregulated. When patients saw a physician, they paid their modest fees out-of-pocket; they were more concerned about the wages they would lose if illness kept them out of work than about the cost of their medical care."" In 1929, the first Blue Cross plans were established to provide pre-paid hospital care, and in the 1930s, Blue Shield Plans begin providing reimbursement for physician services, according to a history of the program. Things changed more in the 1940s -- the era Johnson cited -- as the nation’s population moved from rural to urban areas and medical care shifted even more strongly from homes to medical facilities. Milestones from the 1940s included the first clinical trials of penicillin in 1941 and the 1944 discovery of a drug that could kill the bacteria that caused tuberculosis. In 1946, the Communicable Disease Center (now the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) was founded in Atlanta, and focused on fighting malaria, typhus and other communicable diseases. In addition, World War II played a major role in the expansion of health insurance to the general population. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s ""Focus on Health Reform,"" the War Labor Board ruled in 1943 that some benefits, including health insurance coverage, should be excluded from wage and price controls. Employers then began to boost health insurance benefits in order to attract workers. Following the war, as the economy grew, labor unions also played a role, successfully negotiating for better fringe benefits, including health insurance.   Johnson’s evidence Johnson spokesman Ben Voelkel said in an email that the senator was referring to the total of health consumption expenditures -- HCE, as the government refers to it -- and pointed us to a 1971 report:  ""National Health Expenditures, 1929-70"" by Dorothy P. Rice and Barbara S. Cooper. According to that report, what is now called out-of-pocket spending for 1949 was at 67.7 percent. That’s the 68 cents on every dollar Johnson cited. Figures for 1960 and onward are found on the website of The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a federal entity. A spreadsheet titled ""National Health Expenditures by type of service and source of funds, CY 1960-2015"" shows that for 2015the share of  health care expenditures paid out pocket was at 11.1 percent. Corroborating evidence Christopher J. Conover, a research scholar in the Center for Health Policy & Inequalities Research at Duke University and a Forbes contributor at The Health Policy Skeptic, pointed us to his book The American Health Economy Illustrated. ""Out of pocket share of spending has declined precipitously since 1929,"" Conover wrote in an email. ""Initially this was due to expansion of private health insurance, but in more recent years, the expansion of public coverage (principally Medicare and Medicaid) has overtaken private coverage in terms of displacing what used to be paid for out of pocket."" Some argue health insurance itself has helped drive up costs. Conservative analysts contend that people have little incentive to care about health care costs because someone else -- an insurance company, employer or the government -- is paying the bill. That means patients have little or no reason to shop for lower cost care and health care providers have little incentive to compete on price. This is the reasoning behind the support in some quarters for increasing use of health savings accounts along with high-deductible health plans to give people an incentive to shop for the best health care at the lowest cost. William S. Custer, associate professor and director of the Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University, said although the notion that health insurance drives up healthcare costs has some evidence, the major driver of the growth in health expenditures has been new care health technology. ""The reason most Americans have some form of health insurance is that it is the only way to finance health care,"" Custer said in a statement. ""Most types of insurance cover financial risks, but are not generally the only way to finance the cost of a loss. Homeowner’s insurance can help cover the loss of a house to a fire. But a homeowner could also find a bank willing to lend them the money to rebuild. There is no such option for individuals needing health care."" Further, Custer noted that in 1958 per capita health expenditures were $134, or 2% of median family income. In 2015, per capita health expenditures were $9,990, or 18% of median family income. ""A heart attack can cost $60,000 or more, which is greater than the median family income with no alternative for financing that cost other than health insurance."" In testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on the Budget on Jan. 31, 2008, Congressional Budget Office Director Peter R. Orszag, also that improvements in health and medical technology was a major component in the growth of health care expenses. ""Most analysts agree that the most important factor driving the long-term growth of health care costs has been the emergence, adoption, and widespread diffusion of new medical technologies and services by the U.S. health care system,"" Orszag told the committee. Our rating Johnson said that ""in the ‘40s, 68 cents of every health care dollar was actually paid for by the patient, today it’s only 11 cents."" The numbers track with studies and official statistics. But Johnson is comparing two vastly different eras in health care, including one from a period when fewer people were covered by health insurance and thus paid for costs from their own pocket.

Kevin McCarthy ignores key facts in claim on California water storage
","One of the biggest backers for building new dams and reservoirs in California is House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield. The Republican, who’s been described as the most powerful Californian in Washington D.C., recently spoke on the House floor in favor of a bill to speed up studies on five water storage projects in the state. ""Water is not optional. Not in my district. Not in California. Not anywhere,"" McCarthy told his colleagues. ""But over the past five years my constituents have struggled to survive without life-giving water in the face of a catastrophic drought."" As part of his push for the bill, H.R. 23, McCarthy made a claim about the dearth of water storage construction in the state in recent decades.  McCarthy makes his statement at about the 1:35 minute mark.  ""While California’s population has doubled since the 1970s, we haven’t completed a single major storage project in that time,"" McCarthy said. ""Now that’s worth restating. With California’s population having doubled since the 1970s we have not completed a single major storage project in that time. How can California grow and thrive in the future if we depend on inadequate infrastructure from nearly 50 years go?"" Not a single major water storage project since the 1970s? We wondered: Does the congressman’s claim hold water? We set out on a fact check. Our research In April 2016, we rated Mostly True a related though somewhat different claim by Sen. Feinstein. She said California had ""the same water infrastructure"" as it did in the 1960s. Our research showed large portions of the state’s modern-day water system, including the State Water Project and the federal government’s Central Valley Project, were built mainly in the 1960s or earlier. Construction started in the late 1950s on the State Water Project, a massive set of reservoirs, aqueducts and pumping plants that store and deliver water up and down the state to 25 million Californians. The backbone of the project, including Lake Oroville and the California Aqueduct, was finished in the 1960s and early 1970s. The Central Valley Water Project, which irrigates the San Joaquin Valley, was started in the late 1930s and completed in the early 1970s. This evidence mostly supported Feinstein’s claim. But we also found that regional water districts constructed several significant storage projects in the 1990s and that a new part of the state’s water infrastructure, a large ocean desalination plant, was built two years ago in San Diego County. Using that fact check as a reference, we zeroed in on McCarthy’s claim. McCarthy’s claim The first portion of the congressman’s statement, about California’s population doubling since the 1970s, is basically correct. In 1970, the state was home to 19.9 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. As of July 2016, California’s population was 39.3 million. The second portion of McCarthy’s claim about the lack of major water storage projects built since the 1970s is open to broader interpretation. Asked for evidence to support that part of the statement, McCarthy’s spokesman told us by email that ""the last major (1M+ acre-feet) reservoir/dam we built in CA was in 1978 and it was New Melones Reservoir."" The spokesman did not explain why only reservoirs with a capacity of one million acre-feet or more are considered ""major."" One acre-foot of water equals about 326,000 gallons. The average California household uses between one-half and one acre-foot of water per year. The capacity at New Melones, which sits on the Stanislaus River in the central Sierra Nevada foothills, is 2.4 million acre-feet. Its dam was, indeed, completed in 1978 by the federal government, according to the U.S. Department of Reclamation. But was that really California’s last major water storage project? Is it fair to describe only those projects with a capacity larger than one million acre-feet as major? And are dams and reservoirs the only way the state adds to its water supply? Given that his spokesman cited New Melones, one might interpret McCarthy’s statement as meaning the federal government hasn’t built any major water storage projects in California since the 1970s. The congressman, however, doesn’t make this point clear in his speech. Given the broad nature of the claim, we took it to mean no layer of government has built a large-scale storage project in decades. Experts weigh in Based on interviews with water experts, we found there’s some truth to McCarthy’s assertion. We also found it omits some key information and takes things out of context. California has not constructed any new statewide water storage projects to match the scale of those started in the 1950s under the State Water Project. For some context, the largest reservoirs on that system are Lake Shasta, with a capacity of 4.5 million acre-feet, and Lake Oroville, with a capacity of 3.5 million acre-feet. The bill supported by McCarthy would advance proposed reservoirs such as Temperance Flat on the San Joaquin River in Fresno County and Sites, an offstream reservoir in the Sacramento Valley west of Colusa. Both would have a capacity of more than one million acre-feet. ""It is true that the federal and state governments have not added much,"" said Jay Lund, director of the UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences. ""But local and regional efforts have been quite effective, without new federal storage projects."" Lund said McCarthy’s statement ""is missing a lot of new functional storage,"" in the form of groundwater projects. One such project, the Kern Water Bank, is expected to store 400,000 acre-feet of water this year, Lund said. Recent projects Here’s a look at some of the largest water storage projects built in California since the 1970s: Diamond Valley Lake in Riverside County is the largest reservoir in Southern California. It was completed in 2000 by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and holds up to 800,000 acre feet of water, ""almost as big as Folsom (Lake),"" Lund noted. Lake Sonoma, a reservoir in Sonoma County, was constructed in 1983. It has a capacity of 381,000 acre feet. New Spicer Meadow reservoir was completed in 1989. It sits on a tributary of the Stanislaus River and holds up to 189,000 acre-feet of water. Los Vaqueros Reservoir, completed in 1998 by the Contra Costa Water District near Brentwood. It holds 160,000 acre feet. Peter Gleick of the Pacific Institute, an Oakland-based think tank that advocates for sustainable water policies, said in an interview that McCarthy’s statement ""is just wrong."" He explained that California has continued to build smaller but still significant water storage projects in recent decades while adopting new water supply strategies. In a 2009 column in the San Francisco Chronicle, Gleick wrote the state had added more than 1.6 million acre-feet of water storage since 1979. ""And these numbers don’t include new groundwater storage systems or the vast ‘reservoirs’ of saved water we’ve created through conservation and efficiency programs. Are we adding new traditional storage more and more slowly? Yes. We’ve built on all the good dam sites."" Our ruling House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy recently claimed California hasn’t completed a single major water storage project since the 1970s. His claim is partially accurate. Nothing built since that time compares with the massive reservoirs built in the 1950s and 60s as part of the State Water Project. That doesn’t mean California hasn’t added anything of significance. Regional water districts have built large projects including the 800,000 acre-foot Diamond Valley Lake, built in 2000, the largest reservoir in Southern California. To describe ""major"" water storage projects, McCarthy’s spokesman used what amounts to an arbitrary marker of those with the capacity of one million acre-feet or more. But as water policy experts point out, California has continued to build water storage on a smaller but still significant scale. It’s also adopted new water supply strategies, including groundwater storage and conservation. McCarthy’s statement ignores these important facts and context. We rate his claim Half True.

Do tax preparers outnumber firefighters and police officers, as George Will said?
","Newspaper columnist and TV pundit George Will says the current U.S. tax code takes more manpower to maneuver than firefighting and law enforcement combined. ""The complexity of the code, which is about 4 million words, is why America has more people employed as tax preparers (1.2 million) than as police and firefighters,"" Will wrote in a July 12, 2017, column on tax reform. According to the National Taxpayer Advocate’s annual report to Congress this year, the 2016 tax code indeed came to roughly 4 million words. And even they agreed it’s convoluted. The tax code ""rewards taxpayers who can afford expensive tax advice and discriminates against taxpayers who cannot,"" the report said. But are there more Americans employed as tax preparers than police and firefighters? After a reader asked us to look into it, we found it’s not the case. Will did not respond to our request for comment, but the number in the story linked to a U.S. News & World Report article from 2012, which we eventually traced back to an Internal Revenue Service report citing a 2007 statistic. The number given was that between 900,000 and 1.2 million people were ""preparing tax returns for a fee."" We asked the IRS for a more recent estimate. About 713,448 people had current preparer tax identification numbers, or PTINs, in 2017, the closest estimate to the number of people employed as tax preparers this year. This is an annually renewed credential that the IRS requires of every tax preparer, a prerequisite that wasn’t in place when the original estimate Will cited was created. The Labor Statistics Bureau found in May 2016 that 657,690 people are employed as police and sheriff's patrol officers. In turn, the BLS counted 315,910 firefighters. When we added the number of these civil officers together, they exceeded tax preparers by 260,152 people. The BLS had a much lower figure for people employed as tax preparers -- 70,030 people  -- but these don’t include individuals who were self-employed or identified as attorneys, accountants or auditors, as the survey only allows people to identify one occupation. Will isn't the only person to make this mistake. A May 13, 2017, Economist article also included the outdated information. Will said that the number of tax preparers outnumbered the number of firefighters and police officers in the United States, but he was looking at outdated data. When we looked at the most recent statistics from the IRS and BLS, we found that the sum of firefighters and police officers outnumbers tax preparers.

No, Fox News anchor Shepard Smith did not punch Sean Hannity in the nose after being fired
","Fox News anchor Shepard Smith made headlines when he accused the administration of President Donald Trump of employing lies and deception to conceal the details of a June 2016 meeting between Trump campaign officials, a Russian attorney and several others. In what the Washington Post dubbed a ""Walter Cronkite moment"" — a nod to the newsman of yore revered as ""the most trusted man in America"" for his penchant for speaking uncomfortable truths — Smith launched into a TV tirade after a week of shifting accounts about the Trump Tower meeting left the Fox News anchor exasperated. ""Why is it lie after lie after lie? If you clean, come on clean, you know?"" he said to colleague Chris Wallace on July 14. ""My grandmother used to say ... ‘Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.’ The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling."" Now here’s where things get really weird. Several days after Smith’s on-air editorializing went viral, a website called America’s Last Line of Defense posted a story claiming Smith had been fired by Fox News for criticizing Trump. The story then takes a wild turn, claiming Smith reacted to his firing like a violent madman in the throes of a Godzilla-like meltdown during which Smith threw things across the Fox studio, kicked barrells and punched Fox News host Sean Hannity in the nose, drawing blood. There are two major problems with this story, however. First, as the screengrab below shows, the day after Smith’s supposed firing and meltdown, his hourlong Fox News show Shepard Smith Reporting aired according to its regularly scheduled time.

Fox News host cites Ted Kennedy-KGB meeting that never happened
","Supporters of President Donald Trump have defended Donald Trump Jr. and his readiness to receive Russian materials on Hillary Clinton by finding examples when Democrats tried to do something similar. Fox News host Greg Gutfeld brought up the case of Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass. ""Nothing will ever come close to Ted Kennedy meeting with the KGB in order to beat Ronald Reagan in 1984,"" Gutfeld said on his show July 15. ""It was a quid pro quo. You help the Dems. We help the USSR. If it worked, we would still have the USSR."" As Gutfeld spoke, a graphic appeared on the screen of a 2009 Forbes magazine article, ""Ted Kennedy’s Soviet Gambit."" This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a claim like this, and it’s not the first time this Kennedy-KGB story tracked back to that Forbes story. So is it true? Hardly. There’s not much to back up the tale under any circumstances, but Gutfeld went overboard even relative to the Forbes article. He said Kennedy met with the KGB, something the Forbes piece doesn’t even mention. The Forbes article describes a 1983 memo from Viktor Chebrikov, then head of the Soviet spy agency, to Yuri Andropov, the then-general secretary of the Communist Party. Chebrikov wrote that Kennedy’s trusted friend John Tunney, a former senator from California, had passed along Kennedy’s interest in meeting with Andropov. So even if you take the memo from KGB agent as gospel, there was no actual meeting between Kennedy and the KGB. But what about the rest of the details and the memo? Was Kennedy looking to undermine Reagan? That’s murkier than you might expect. In early 1983, Reagan’s plan to place medium-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe generated great concern among voters in the West and also within the leadership of the USSR. The KGB memo detailed a proposal, ostensibly from Kennedy via Tunney, to de-escalate tensions. Those steps included Andropov inviting Kennedy and Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., for a meeting in Moscow. The purpose ""would be to arm Soviet officials with explanations regarding problems of nuclear disarmament so they may be better prepared and more convincing during appearances in the USA."" In addition, Kennedy’s middleman suggested that Andropov come to the United States where he could do interviews on the big three broadcast networks and speak to the ""peaceful intentions of the USSR."" According to the memo, Kennedy’s goal was to ""root out the threat of nuclear war, and to improve Soviet-American relations, so that they define the safety of the world."" The memo does mention Kennedy’s interest in the presidency, but the idea was for Kennedy to run in 1988. (Kennedy never ran and supported then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.) The memo said, ""Because he (Kennedy) formally refused to partake in the election campaign of 1984, his speeches would be taken without prejudice as they are not tied to any campaign promises. Tunney remarked that the senator wants to run for president in 1988."" Having served two terms, Reagan would not be on the ballot in 1988. The memo gained attention when it was the basis of a news report published in the London Times in 1992, after the Soviet Union dissolved. When the report came out, Tunney told the London Times that it was ""bull----."" We reached Tunney in 2015, and he emphatically repeated that. ""The idea that I would be handling contacts with Andropov is preposterous,"" Tunney said. ""This memo is completely false."" At the time, Tunney was a private businessman, but his friendship with Kennedy dated back to law school. He said that while he had made many trips to Moscow over the years and knew people in the KGB, the only political topic Kennedy ever asked him to broach with the Soviets was a deal to release dozens of dissidents. In exchange, Kennedy would make a speech at a university in one of the USSR’s republics in Central Asia. That took place several years earlier. Tunney said that some time after the memo emerged, Kennedy asked him if he knew anything about it, and Tunney said, ""this is crazy."" In 1992, a Boston Herald reporter reached Kennedy spokesman Paul Donovan. Donovan said Kennedy’s office had made other efforts to meet with Andropov, but nothing ever came of it. According to the Herald, Donovan said, ""The rest of the memo is KGB fiction."" Denials from anyone tied to Kennedy might be expected, but Kennedy does have a sort of character reference in the arena of foreign relations from a Reagan insider, the administration’s disarmament negotiator Max Kampelman. In his memoirs Entering New Worlds, Kampelman wrote that the Soviets liked working with Kennedy as a back-door conduit of information, and Kampelman welcomed the arrangement. ""I learned that the senator never acted or received information without informing the appropriate United States agency or official,"" Kampelman wrote. In 1985, Reagan himself approved using Kennedy this way, and a working relationship grew between Kampelman and Kennedy. While it is possible that the administration never caught wind of any contacts Tunney had with the KGB, it is worth noting that when the archivists at the Reagan Library searched the White House files on Kennedy, no episode involving the USSR in 1983 popped up. In the Reagan years, Kenneth Adelman served as deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. and then director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. In 2015, we asked Adelman what he made of the KGB memo, and he dismissed it. He had no idea if an overture might have been made, but even it had, Adelman said it didn’t matter. ""We knew senators were doing this sort of thing all the time, and we ignored it,"" Adelman said. ""We didn’t think it was important, and it wasn’t. The administration didn’t care about it."" Stephen Cohen, a political scientist at Princeton University and New York University, suggested that KGB memos shouldn’t be taken at face value. ""As someone who has worked for years in once closed Soviet-era archives, I can tell you that many false documents can be found there,"" Cohen told PunditFact in 2015. ""As the saying goes, rubbish in, rubbish out."" Paul Kengor, a political scientist at Grove City College who included the memo in his book about Reagan, The Crudasder, takes the memo seriously. ""The memo is absolutely accurate,"" Kengor said. ""No question."" It is worth noting that the memo does not say how Tunney conveyed Kennedy's message beyond ""through confidential contacts."" In other words, the memo's author was relying on someone else and not speaking from his own experience, which introduces another level of uncertainty. Gutfeld said that Kennedy met with the KGB in order to defeat Ronald Reagan in 1984. There is certainly evidence that Kennedy attempted to meet with Soviet officials, but it was with the approval of the Reagan White House. The validity of a specific KGB memo saying Kennedy wanted to de-escalate tensions with Moscow over a U.S. plan to install nuclear missiles in Western Europe is widely questioned. But more to the point, Gutfeld reached one conclusion that doesn’t add up. There is no evidence of Kennedy ""meeting with the KGB."" The evidence Gutfeld used on screen doesn’t support that contention. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2017/jul/18/greg-gutfeld/fox-news-host-cites-ted-kennedy-kgb-meeting-never-/

Trump claims he got rid of the Johnson Amendment. Is that true?
","Responding to compliments about his election victory and support from evangelical voters, President Donald Trump told Christian Broadcasting Network’s founder Pat Robertson that he had signed an order to empower religious leaders to speak up politically. ""We've really helped because I've gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment, now we are going to go try to get rid of it permanently in Congress, but I signed an executive order so that now people like you that I want to hear from, ministers and and preachers and rabbis and whoever it may be, they can speak,"" Trump said in a July 12 interview with Robertson. ""You know, you couldn’t speak politically before; now you can. And I want to hear from you and others that we like."" During the campaign Trump accurately said that an amendment pushed by Lyndon B. Johnson threatened religious institutions with the loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocated their political views. Trump then said he would repeal that language. So Trump’s comments to Robertson left us wondering if in fact Trump had ""gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment"" and if because of his executive order religious leaders were able to speak up politically. Politics and religion experts told us Trump’s remarks were misleading on several grounds: He does not have the constitutional authority to eliminate the law, and religious leaders have been speaking up politically even before Trump’s order, despite the legal restriction. We noted in a previous fact check of Trump’s remarks about the ""Johnson Amendment"" that the restriction comes from the Internal Revenue Code, and that it applies to all 501(c)(3) organizations, known as charitable organizations. The term ""Johnson Amendment"" derives from America’s 36th president, Lyndon B. Johnson, who became president when John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Johnson championed the restriction in 1954 when he was a U.S. senator running for re-election. A conservative nonprofit group that wanted to limit the treaty-making ability of the president produced material that called for electing his primary opponent, millionaire rancher-oilman Dudley Dougherty. In response, Johnson, then Senate Democratic minority leader, introduced an amendment to section 501(c)(3) of the federal tax code dealing with tax-exempt charitable organizations, including groups organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literacy and educational purposes, or to prevent cruelty to children or animals. The objective was to restrict the involvement in partisan politics of organizations that wanted to be exempt from paying taxes. The law says: ""Under the Internal Revenue Code, all section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office. Contributions to political campaign funds or public statements of position (verbal or written) made on behalf of the organization in favor of or in opposition to any candidate for public office clearly violate the prohibition against political campaign activity. Violating this prohibition may result in denial or revocation of tax-exempt status and the imposition of certain excise taxes."" Trump told Robertson that he had ""gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment."" But that’s misleading. Trump cannot get ""rid of"" a law because a president does not have that constitutional authority. Trump needs Congress to take action; he even referenced that process when he added to his statement, ""now we are going to go try to get rid of it permanently in Congress."" (A bill on this topic introduced by Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., is in the Ways and Means Committee.) We asked the White House for more information on Trump’s comments but did not get a response. What Trump has done is sign an executive order that tells the Treasury Department to be lenient in its enforcement of current law against religious organizations. Specifically, the May 4 order said: ""The Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure, to the extent permitted by law, that the Department of the Treasury does not take any adverse action against any individual, house of worship, or other religious organization on the basis that such individual or organization speaks or has spoken about moral or political issues from a religious perspective, where speech of similar character has, consistent with law, not ordinarily been treated as participation or intervention in a political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) a candidate for public office by the Department of the Treasury."" The order defines adverse action as the imposition of any tax or tax penalty, delay or denial of tax-exempt status, disallowance of tax deductions for contributions made to the charitable organizations, ""or any other action that makes unavailable or denies any tax deduction, exemption, credit, or benefit."" An array of experts and groups said Trump's order doesn't achieve much. ""As of right now, Trump's comments that he got rid of the Johnson amendment are inaccurate and an overstatement,"" said Jeanine Kraybill, who researches politics and religion and is an assistant professor of political science at California State University-Bakersfield. Trump did not get rid of the Johnson Amendment, ""he just ordered that apparently it not be enforced,"" said Kenneth D. Wald, a distinguished professor of political science at the University of Florida. The American Civil Liberties Union expressed concerns about Trump’s executive order based on a leaked draft, but later said it had ""no discernible policy outcome."" The conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom, which advocates on behalf of pastors and churches and against the Johnson Amendment, said Trump’s order came up short and described it as just ""vague instructions"" with wiggle room to be ignored. Experts also told us that it's inaccurate to suggest religious leaders could not speak politically. ""The regulations have never been designed to prevent ministers or other church officials from speaking in church about social and political issues,"" said Wald, the University of Florida professor. What they are forbidden from doing is formally endorsing candidates, Wald said. Also, the Johnson Amendment has not been strongly enforced over the years, and preachers and pastors have openly challenged it, said Kraybill, the professor at California State University-Bakersfield. Kraybill said that since 2008 the ""Pulpit Freedom Sunday"" movement, which began with the Alliance Defending Freedom, has led pastors of primarily conservative churches to intentionally preach about candidates and encourage their congregations to vote a certain way. A pastor in San Diego told CNN last year that his church records sermons and sends them to the Internal Revenue Service ""in the hopes of provoking a lawsuit,"" and that those efforts have been fruitless. ""It has been quite rare as matter of practice for the IRS to enforce that rule,"" said Kent Greenfield, a law professor at Boston College. Pew Research Center in August 2016 published survey results that said about two-thirds of Americans who had attended religious services had heard clergy at their church speak about social and political issues. Some churchgoers had even heard clergy speak in support or opposition of a specific presidential candidate, Pew found. With that context, Trump’s executive order in many ways attempts to codify the status quo. But it doesn’t eliminate the Johnson Amendment. Trump said, ""I've gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment … I signed an executive order so that now ... ministers and and preachers and rabbis and whoever it may be, they can speak. You know, you couldn’t speak politically before, now you can."" Experts say Trump’s claim is an overstatement because his executive order merely directed the Treasury Department to be lenient in its enforcement of the law. The president does not have constitutional authority to eliminate laws. In practice, the law has rarely been enforced, experts said, and clergy members have spoken about social and political issues, or even spoken in favor or against candidates. Trump’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Fake news saga claims Paul Ryan attended Loretta Lynch-Bill Clinton meeting
","An online post that said House Speaker Paul Ryan witnessed the 2016 meeting between former President Bill Clinton and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch is a fake news story that is part of a larger contrived saga.

Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fake as part of the social media site’s efforts to cut down on fake news.

Supposedly new information about the meeting came to light, the post said. A Baltimore Morning News reporter determined from flight paperwork that Ryan traveled with Lynch to Phoenix, specifically to attend the meeting with Clinton. The story launched into several melodramatic theories why the trio were meeting, including possibly brokering then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s ""freedom at the expense of an embarrassing national election loss."" There’s no newspaper called the Baltimore Morning News, and there’s no proof Ryan was at all involved in the meeting, because the story is fake.

No, Malia Obama wasn't fired by the Spanish Embassy for smoking marijuana
","It’s summer internship season and everyone loves a juicy story on a former first daughter’s internship cut short due to drug busts. At least fake news sites seem to. Don’t be fooled, though. A story that Malia Obama was fired from an internship at the U.S. embassy to Spain is fake news. A June 29, 2017, post on FreedomCrossroads.us says that the eldest daughter of former President Barack Obama was caught smoking marijuana during her internship at the Spanish embassy and sent home. ""She was caught, by Embassy Security — aka the U.S. Marines — on the roof of the building burning a doobie and playing with the Ambassador’s carrier pigeons,"" the story said. ""Ambassador Bedard is an avid hobbyist."" Obama did intern at the embassy, in 2016, not this year. And there were no reports of her dismissal. This summer, Obama traveled with her family to Bali and Jakarta and is continuing an internship at the Weinstein Company movie studio she began in the spring. She is still expected to go to Harvard in the fall — which the post also denied. ""She won’t be starting Harvard this fall and she has no future in government, since all government jobs require drug tests,"" the post said. The story said Malia Obama was caught by U.S. Marines, but that’s unrealistic. They are indeed stationed at embassies, but their primary role is that of protecting classified material in the interest of the United States’ national security — not watching over summer interns. The post also refers to the wrong ambassador. There has never been a U.S. ambassador to Spain by the name of Bedard, and there is actually no U.S. ambassador in Spain at all right now. Trump called for the resignation of foreign ambassadors nominated by Obama at the start of his tenure, and hasn’t replaced previous Spanish ambassador to Spain, James Costos, since. We don’t know whose carrier pigeons the story refers to, but there were no reports of pigeons during her internship last year, either. This isn’t the first time a fake news story about the former president’s eldest daughter has made its rounds on blogs and Facebook this year. Previous reports we’ve debunked said that Malia was expelled from Harvard before she even started and that she was arrested for drinking, drugs and dog-fighting.

Are a third of people with drug problems on Medicaid, as Elizabeth Warren said?
","In a video denouncing the Senate health care bill’s slashing of Medicaid funding, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., emphasized the importance of Medicaid in battling the opioid crisis. Warren called an additional $45 billion introduced in the new Senate health care bill to fight the opioid crisis insufficient if spending on Medicaid is to decrease. ""Right now, Medicaid is the principal way we deal with opioid abuse,"" Warren said. ""One in three people who’s receiving treatment for drug problems gets some help from Medicaid to pay for that."" A reader asked us to check out her claim. Are one in three people receiving treatment for drug problems on Medicaid? When we asked her office to clarify her statement, they said Warren referred specifically to opioid users, rather than all of those who suffer from drug problems. Warren was referencing a study by Richard Frank, a professor of Health Economics in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School who testified before the Senate’s Joint Economic Committee. Frank calculated the percentage of the non-elderly adult population with opioid use disorder covered by Medicaid, which came to 34.3 percent. He used data from the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the latest study from the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality. Thirty-four percent effectively comes to 1.029, or one, person for every three. Warren said those people are receiving treatment, but Frank’s research looked at people suffering from opioid use disorder whether or not they are currently in treatment. But other research supports her point. When the Kaiser Family Foundation ran the numbers for us, they found that of the 880,000 nonelderly adults with opioid addiction who received treatment for opioid use disorder in 2015, 39 percent were covered by Medicaid. They looked at the same information as Frank. When we extended the population size to include people of all ages, the number was similar: 38 percent. Breaking down these numbers further, 51 percent of the 880,000 treated adults got outpatient treatment only (which refers to visits that don’t warrant an overnight stay), 6 percent got inpatient treatment only, and 43 percent got both inpatient and outpatient treatment. Julia Zur, a senior policy analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation, explained that outpatient treatment is more popular and that patients who start in inpatient treatment will often go on to receive outpatient treatment. When we asked why the number of those who are receiving treatment and covered by Medicaid is higher than those who are simply covered, Frank explained that Medicaid programs tend to be more generous in covering costs than private programs, and Medicaid plans cover at least some medication-assisted treatment to treat substance use disorders. The Medicaid expansion was particularly helpful in securing coverage, as it reached high-need segments of the low-income population in states that have been hard hit by the opioid crisis. Warren said that one in three people receiving treatment for opioid addiction were covered by Medicaid, basing her estimate on 34 percent of people with opioid use disorder. The number was higher when we looked at only those receiving treatment: 39 percent. So while the numbers differ slightly, one in three is still a fair estimate.

Is ISIS 'infiltrating America and using Syrians to do it'?
","In the hard-fought special election to fill a vacant, Atlanta-area congressional seat, a Republican group’s ad blares the alarm about terrorism on U.S. soil. In the ad, the National Republican Congressional Committee charges Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff with being soft on terrorism. ""ISIS is infiltrating America and using Syrians to do it,"" the ad’s narrator says in a steely voice. ""The FBI warned we can't safely screen every Syrian. Yet Jon Ossoff's liberal party bosses brought 10,000 Syrian refugees to America. And Ossoff supports their dangerous Iran nuclear deal allowing billions for the leading sponsor of terrorism. Billions that will fund terror. While terrorists infiltrate and attack with our safety at risk, Jon Ossoff is just too risky."" Just in case you didn’t get the point, the ad uses lots of not-very-subtle footage of facemask-wearing terrorists, burning American flags and the like. We’ve checked some portions of this narration previously -- the part about the FBI warnings on screenings got a Half True, for instance, and the part about the Iran nuclear deal funding terrorism also got a Half True. Here, we’ll look at the opening line -- that ""ISIS is infiltrating America and using Syrians to do it."" We found solid reasons to be dubious of this claim. The ad contends, twice, that ISIS supporters are ""infiltrating"" the United States from Syria in order to commit terrorist acts. The big problem with that claim: To date, there is not a single documented case of that happening. Nor are there any documented cases that come reasonably close to that description. ""There’s no sliver of truth here,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism specialist at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. ""It’s simply a false statement."" There is one area of the world where Syrian ISIS infiltration might be taking place. ISIS members posing as refugees from Syria can make their way to central and western Europe either over land or by boat from the Mediterranean. But that’s not the case for the United States, the locale that’s clearly the subject of the NRCC ad. For entering the United States, ""ISIS infiltration is not very efficient,"" Gartenstein-Ross said. It’s not that the screening process is perfect, he said, but rather a question of math. ""The refugee-selection process is designed to select very few military-age, single males, and even if you fit the criteria, the odds are still not good that you’ll get selected"" to go to the United States, he said. And before gaining entry to the United States, you are likely to have a long wait in a refugee camp. (We’ve previously looked at the composition of refugees by age and sex here.) NRCC spokeswoman Maddie Anderson argued for the ad’s accuracy by saying that in addition to physical infiltration, ""ISIS is also infiltrating us with their ideology by seeking to inspire lone wolf attacks here from afar. The domestic terrorists have gotten their ideas and been inspired by what’s going on in the Middle East."" We have no objection to the argument that ISIS is inspiring lone-wolf terrorists -- the list below is chock full of examples. But the ad didn’t urge efforts to combat ideological propaganda on social media. It used the phrase ""terrorists infiltrate"" and referred to Syrian refugee admissions -- of humans, not ideas. So the ad gives a very different impression than the one Anderson was arguing. The rare instances in which an adult entered the United States and later went on to commit a terrorist act don’t apply to what the ad said about Syrians. The closest example might be the case of two Iraqi immigrants, Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, who were arrested in 2011 in a sting in Bowling Green, Ky. Before coming to the United States, Alwan had made bombs that allegedly targeted American military personnel in Iraq. So he was a terrorist before coming to the United States, and he did enter -- ""infiltrate"" -- the country. But he came to the United States before ISIS existed, and before the beginning of the civil war that triggered an influx of displaced Syrians. Another example involves Egyptian national Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, the perpetrator of a 2002 mass shooting at the Los Angeles airport. Prior to his immigration to the United States, Egyptian authorities accused him of belonging to the terrorist organization Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (though he denied this charge). The FBI concluded that Hadayet’s killing spree was a terrorist act, but he acted alone and hoped to influence U.S. government policy toward Palestine. This attack pre-dates the dynamic in Syria by a decade and a half. Among more recent perpetrators, Tashfeen Malik, half of the married couple behind the 2015 San Bernardino shootings, came in on a marriage visa. But she was a Pakistani who had come most recently from Saudi Arabia -- not Syria. She pledged loyalty to ISIS shortly before the attack. However, far more common than ""infiltration"" cases are examples of self-radicalization by people already in the United States, mostly people who were born and/or raised in America. Often, they are driven to terrorism by propaganda and social media networks, and sometimes they pledge loyalty to ISIS before committing an attack. Some examples of self-radicalization since the 9/11 attacks: • Seattle Jewish Federation shooting. In July 2006, Naveed Afzal Haq killed one woman and injured five others at the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle. He was a U.S. citizen of Pakistani descent who grew up in Washington state. • University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill attack. In March 2006, UNC graduate Mohammad Reza Taheri-azar drove an SUV onto campus, injuring nine pedestrians. He was born in Iran but entered the United States as a young child and was a naturalized U.S. citizen. • Little Rock recruiting station shooting. In 2009, Abdulhakim Muhammed pleaded guilty to killing Pvt. William Long and wounding Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula during a shooting outside a U.S. Army recruiting station in Little Rock, Ark. Born as Carlos Bledsoe and reared as a Baptist in Memphis, Tenn., he was a convert to Islam. • Fort Hood shooting. In 2009, Nidal Hasan, a psychiatrist and major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, went on a shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, that left 13 soldiers and civilians dead and more than two dozen others wounded. Hasan was of Palestinian descent, but he was born in Virginia and was a U.S. citizen. • The ""underwear bomber."" In 2009, Umar Farook Abdulmutallab became known as the ""underwear bomber"" on Dec. 25, 2009, after he tried to blow up a plane flying to Detroit using a bomb strapped to his underwear. Unlike others on this list, he did not try to settle in the United States but rather boarded a U.S.-bound flight overseas. • Times Square bombing. In 2010, Faisal Shahzad tried to plant a bomb in Times Square in New York City. He did come to the United States to be a student, but he was from a prominent Pakistani military family, and he appears to have radicalized after arriving in the United States. • Boston Marathon bombing. In 2013, brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev carried out twin explosive device attacks at the Boston Marathon, killing three spectators and injuring more than 260 people. The brothers came to the United States as children after their parents fled Chechnya. They arrived in the United States on tourist visas, and then their family applied for asylum. Dzhokhar became a U.S. citizen on Sept. 11, 2012, while Tamerlan had a green card and had applied for citizenship. • Queens hatchet attack. In 2014, Zale H. Thompson injured two New York City police officers using a metal hatchet. Police officials said Thompson was a self-radicalized convert to Islam. • Chattanooga shooting. In 2015, Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez shot and killed five people at two military sites Chattanooga. Abdulazeez was born in Kuwait but moved with his family to the United States as an infant, and he became a naturalized citizen. The FBI said the shooter was inspired by foreign terrorist propaganda. • San Bernardino shootings. The other half of the married couple that carried out the 2015 attack -- Syed Rizwan Farook -- was a U.S. citizen. His parents had emigrated from Pakistan to Chicago, and Farook was born in the United States and raised in California. • Orlando Pulse shootings. In 2016, Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in an Orlando nightclub shooting. He was born in the United States to Afghan immigrant parents. • New York-New Jersey bombings. In 2016, three bombs exploded in New York City and New Jersey, injuring at least 30 people. The alleged perpetrator, Ahmad Khan Rahimi, was born in Afghanistan but came to the United States at age 7 and became a U.S. citizen. • Ohio State university attack. In 2016, Abdul Razal Ali Artan allegedly injured 13 in an attack on the campus of Ohio State University. Artan, an Ohio State student, came to the United States from Somalia as a child and was a legal permanent resident. Bottom line: In most of the terrorist attacks attempted on U.S. soil since 9/11, the perpetrator has either been born in the United States or brought here as a child. Typically, the perpetrator has been influenced by propaganda and gone through a process of self-radicalization inside the United States. ""As far as I know, there is not a single example of a refugee or any other immigrant from Syria committing an act of terrorism in the U.S.,"" said Barnett Rubin, associate director of the Center on International Cooperation at New York University. ""If ISIS is trying to attack the U.S. by infiltrating Syrian terrorists, it has completely failed."" The ad said that ""ISIS is infiltrating America and using Syrians to do it."" ISIS may dream of carrying out this plan, but there is zero evidence so far of it having worked. In the few examples since 2001 of an ""infiltration"" leading to a terror attack, they have not involved ISIS terrorists from Syria. Indeed, the ad’s focus on infiltration amounts to misdirection from a concern that’s more worrisome to terrorism experts -- self-radicalization by people born in America or brought here as youngsters.

Bernie Sanders inflates Trump tax plan benefits to billionaires
","Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called President Donald Trump’s budget a massive transfer of wealth from working families, the elderly, children, the sick and the poor to the top 1 percent. ""Why is it more important to give a $100 billion tax break to 3 of the wealthiest families than to feed, house and educate 15 million people?"" Sanders tweeted May 25. Why is it more important to give a $100 billion tax break to 3 of the wealthiest families than to feed, house and educate 15 million people? We decided to fact-check whether the Trump budget indeed bestows a $100 billion tax break on three of the wealthiest families in the United States. The accusation runs into trouble by running away with a flawed analysis of Trump’s tax plan. Sanders’ source is a report prepared by Democrats on the U.S. Senate Budget Committee. The report shows the maximum estate tax liability for a group of wealthy Americans, including billionaires and some members of the Trump administration, and how much they would stand to gain if the estate tax were repealed. The three billionaire families listed on the chart are the Walton family of Wal-Mart, Charles and David Koch of Koch Industries, and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. According to the report, these families stand to gain $52 billion, $38 billion and $12 billion respectively in tax breaks under Trump’s proposal, or $102 billion all together. How? The rules for the estate tax allow a person to inherit almost $5.5 million tax free. Above that, Washington collects 40 percent. Senate Democrats took the total net worth of those three households, reduced it by the tax-exempt amount, and assumed the remainder would be taxed at the 40 percent rate. The problem is, experts said, Sanders miscast Trump’s tax plan, and the Democratic calculations are overly simple. Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Brookings-Urban Institute Tax Policy Center, said Sanders is not fully capturing Trump's proposal for the estate tax. ""Trump has proposed replacing the estate tax with a requirement that estates pay income tax on all of an estate's unrealized capital gains,"" Williams said. Unrealized capital gains are the profits made when an investment, such as a building or shares of stock, is sold.   ""If a high-value estate had unrealized gains, it would pay income tax on those gains at the top rate of 20 percent rather than an estate tax at a 40 percent rate,"" he said. He gave an example: An estate worth $50 billion with $25 billion of unrealized gains would pay income tax of $5 billion under Trump’s plan -- a lot less than the $20 billion that would be owed in today’s tax system, but ""not zero."" Sanders assumed those wealthy family members would pay nothing, and that’s not certain. It should be noted that Trump has not said anything about unrealized capital gains in his budget, although he makes a mention of doing away with most special interest tax breaks without clarifying what those tax breaks are. But even in the absence of any tax on unrealized capital gains, the three wealthy families still wouldn’t net $100 billion under the estate tax abolition plan. Here’s why. Although the estate tax is 40 percent, a slew of deductions bring down the taxable value of the estate reduce the effective tax rate. Those deductions include charitable bequests, among other loopholes. There’s a big gap between the size of the estates the Democrats relied on and the size in the eyes of the IRS, said Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the right-leaning Tax Foundation. The Democrats relied on estimates from Forbes magazine, and Pomerleau said by one estimate, the actual number is about half that. ""And then according to the IRS, taxable estate is about 30 percent of gross estate,"" he said. ""Taking these together, taxable estate -- what the IRS applies the 40 percent rate to -- is about 15 percent of what is publicly reported on average."" Pomerleau said by his estimate, the total value of the estate tax bill for those three families would be closer to $16 billion. Williams at the Tax Policy Center agreed. Any person with a very large estate would bring on an estate tax lawyer to structure his or her estate in ways that would reduce estate tax. ""It is hard to imagine that those families would ever be taxed on the full value of their wealth, given the many ways available to reduce estate valuations, pass wealth to subsequent generations at reduced value, and use other techniques to delay or cut estate tax liabilities,"" he said. This means it is highly unlikely that wealthy families would ever pay 40 percent tax on their wealth under the current estate tax law. Eliminating the estate tax thus would not save them 40 percent of their wealth relative to current law. Trump’s budget also proposes other tax measures, including doing away with the alternate minimum tax, lowering the top individual tax rate from 39.6 percent to 35 percent, and repealing taxes on the wealthy that helped pay for the Affordable Care Act. While Sanders’ office only pointed to the estate tax, his tweet was more expansive, so we asked our experts to assess the impact. They said while these factors would indeed help the wealthy save money it would be difficult to estimate it in dollars in the absence of tax returns. We raised this issue with Sanders’ office and did not hear back. Sanders said Trump’s budget gives a $100 billion tax break to three of the wealthiest families. His office pointed to a Democratic analysis that assumed the total elimination of the estate tax. But Trump’s proposal would retain a measure to tax some portion of inherited wealth. On top of that, the experts we reached told us that careful tax planning reduces the government’s take under current law. They said the Democrats greatly exaggerated the potential tax bills these families face, and the real cost would be considerably less than $100 billion. Trump’s tax plan has other features that would cut taxes on the super wealthy, but it isn’t possible to quantify the impact with any accuracy. The three wealthy families Sanders had in mind would benefit handsomely under Trump’s plan, but his office did not provide evidence that held up, and experts said the total would likely be less than the $100 billion he said. We rate this claim Mostly False. Update, June 2, 2017: We added information after our initial publication to clarify what Trump's budget said about estate taxes and unrealized capital gains. ",/factchecks/2017/may/31/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-inflates-trump-tax-plan-benefits-bi/

Fox News host wrong that no law forbids Russia-Trump collusion
","Fox News host Gregg Jarrett has a distinctive take on the investigation into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Jarrett, a former defense attorney, said that even if the two worked together, it wasn’t illegal. ""Collusion is not a crime, only an antitrust law,"" he said on May 30. ""You can collude all you want with a foreign government in an election. There's no such statute."" Jarrett made the same point in an article on the Fox News website. He wrote that special counsel Robert Mueller had been given the ""futile"" task of investigating a crime that doesn’t exist. ""As special counsel, Mueller can engage in all manner of spectacular jurisprudential gymnastics,"" Jarrett wrote. ""However, it will not change the fact that colluding with Russia is not, under America’s criminal codes, a crime."" Really? We thought we’d look into the legal landscape. We wanted to know what election law does or doesn’t say; this is a separate question from what did or did not occur. By way of brief recap, the U.S. Justice Department appointed Mueller to investigate Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election. His first task was to explore ""any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump."" Jarrett said the only real trouble for the Trump campaign would be if it committed some other crime, such as helping the Russians hack into Democratic emails. He dismissed that as implausible and unsupported by any public evidence. We ran Jarrett’s argument by three election law professors, and they all said that while the word ""collusion"" might not appear in key statutes (they couldn’t say for sure that it was totally absent), working with the Russians could violate criminal laws. Nathaniel Persily at Stanford University Law School said one relevant statute is the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. ""A foreign national spending money to influence a federal election can be a crime,"" Persily said. ""And if a U.S. citizen coordinates, conspires or assists in that spending, then it could be a crime."" Persily pointed to a 2011 U.S. District Court ruling based on the 2002 law. The judges said that the law bans foreign nationals ""from making expenditures to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a political candidate."" Another election law specialist, John Coates at Harvard University Law School, said if Russians aimed to shape the outcome of the presidential election, that would meet the definition of an expenditure. ""The related funds could also be viewed as an illegal contribution to any candidate who coordinates (colludes) with the foreign speaker,"" Coates said. To be sure, no one is saying that coordination took place. What’s in doubt is whether the word ""collusion"" is as pivotal as Jarrett makes it out to be. Coates said discussions between a campaign and a foreigner could violate the law against fraud. ""Under that statute, it is a federal crime to conspire with anyone, including a foreign government, to ‘deprive another of the intangible right of honest services,’ "" Coates said. ""That would include fixing a fraudulent election, in my view, within the plain meaning of the statute."" Josh Douglas at the University of Kentucky Law School offered two other possible relevant statutes. ""Collusion in a federal election with a foreign entity could potentially fall under other crimes, such as against public corruption,"" Douglas said. ""There's also a general anti-coercion federal election law."" In sum, legal experts mentioned four criminal laws that might have been broken. The key is not whether those statutes use the word collusion, but whether the activities of the Russians and Trump associates went beyond permissible acts. Jarrett said that ""you can collude all you want with a foreign government in an election,"" because there’s no law that says collusion is a crime. Three prominent election law scholars said there are at least four laws that would prohibit the sort of activities under investigation, whether those laws mention collusion or not. Jarrett’s focus on a single word fails to reflect the reach of the criminal code. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2017/may/31/gregg-jarrett/fox-news-hosts-wrong-no-law-forbids-russia-trump-c/

Fake news: Pat Robertson did NOT say gays should wear specially-colored clothes
","The website USPOLN, already flagged as a fake news site on our handy guide, recycled an evocative bit of fakery about television evangelist Pat Robertson that dates from 2015.

Are there U.S. embassies in countries listed in Trump's travel ban?
","Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said judges who have ruled against President Donald Trump’s executive order suspending immigration of nationals from some Muslim-majority nations are ""dead wrong"" to call the directive a ""Muslim ban."" The issue is that there is ""very little ability"" to verify and vet the people coming from the countries listed in Trump’s directive, Kelly said, adding that most of the countries have no passports, no police and no intelligence on its people. ""Many of the countries in question don't even have a U.S. embassy there to help us vet,"" Kelly told Fox News’ Chris Wallace on May 28. Trump’s revised, March 6 order — currently blocked by courts — aimed to temporarily suspend entry of nationals from Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.  Is it true that there is no U.S. embassy in many of those countries? Information from the State Department shows there isn’t an embassy in at least four of those six.   David Lapan, spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, referred us to information posted on the State Department’s website regarding countries with limited or no U.S. visa services. U.S. embassies and consulates sometimes limit or suspend their visa services for reasons that include natural disasters, civil unrest, war and security concerns, the State Department said. The State Department website said the United States does not have diplomatic relationships with Iran, therefore no U.S. embassy or consulate in that country. Other countries listed as having no diplomatic relationship were Bhutan and North Korea.  The State Department’s website said that on July 26, 2014, the U.S. embassy in Tripoli, Libya, ""went on ordered departure and staff temporarily departed due to the ongoing fighting around our embassy and the serious risks faced by our diplomatic personnel."" The ambassador to Libya and a core group of personnel work from the U.S. embassy in Tunis, Tunisia. Since visa services are unavailable in Libya, the State Department designated the U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca, Morocco, ""as the processing post"" for visa applications from Libyan immigrants. The U.S. embassy in Damascus, Syria, suspended its operations in February 2012. U.S. citizens in need of emergency assistance are to contact the embassy of the Czech Republic in Damascus, which acts as a protecting power for U.S. citizens.  U.S. passports or visas are not issued in Syria. The United States does not have an embassy or diplomatic presence in Somalia. It has a mission to Somalia that operates out of Nairobi, Kenya.  The United States does have an embassy in Khartoum, Sudan. It also has an embassy in Sana’a, Yemen, but out of political and security concerns has reduced its staffing to ""minimal levels."" The embassy has also suspended its consular services, the State Department said. The U.S. embassy in Cairo, Egypt processes visas for Yemeni citizens.  Trump’s first executive order included Iraq, but the country was left out in the revised order. The United States does have an embassy in Iraq’s capital, Baghdad. Having an embassy helps in the vetting process because that's where the State Department can do most of its questioning, said Bill Hing, an immigration expert and law professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law. Though refugees from areas of conflict are also often vetted at U.S. embassies in other countries, Hing said.

Fake story about President Trump greenlighting Congress to ramp up Clinton investigation
","A fake news story makes the explosive claim that, on the heels of his inauguration, President Donald Trump personally greenlighted the chairman of a powerful congressional watchdog committee to pursue criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. The story appears on the website Federalist Tribune alongside a video clip in which Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, recalled Trump speaking in general terms about Chaffetz’s oversight authority during a backstage meeting at the Jan. 26 Republican retreat in Philadelphia. But at no point does the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee claim that Trump even mentioned Clinton’s name -- much less that Trump urged him to ramp up an investigation into the 2016 Democratic nominee, as the story claims. The Federalist Tribune story, which has more than 5,000 page views at the time of this writing, is just one of several websites to use the Chaffetz video to advance the unsubstantiated claim that Trump encouraged Congress to aggressively pursue charges against Clinton. And it’s worth noting that as it stands now, we’ve rated Trump’s campaign promise to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton as Stalled. The fake article opens with the inflammatory allegation that Trump has ""finally given Congress the authorization"" to pursue charges against Clinton over her use of a private email server while secretary of state. It then mischaracterizes Chaffetz’s recollection of his meeting with Trump by claiming Chaffetz’s statement ""hint(s) that charges against Hillary could be happening soon"" -- before promising that ""Hillary Clinton may finally be indicted."" In truth, the video shows Chaffetz merely recalling how Trump offered him words of encouragement about staying focused on his oversight mission, without mentioning any specific investigations.    Chaffetz recalled Trump telling him, ""‘I understand that I’m the president. But you have a job to do. You do the oversight. You don't slow down. You go after everything you want to go after. You look at anything you want to look at.’"" Chaffetz said Trump’s words at the Philadelphia convention were an inspiring message about how Trump views his committee’s government watchdog role. ""If you sat there and heard what he said to me about pursuing oversight of the government and the function that we fulfill, you’d be pretty inspired,"" Chaffetz said. ""And for him to convey a message of 'Don't slow down, go do your job, there’s a lot to get after with the government,' I think was a good message."" It’s wrongheaded to extrapolate from Chaffetz’s statement that Trump gave his imprimatur to a ramped-up investigation into Clinton. Chaffetz’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. For his part, Chaffetz said after the election that Clinton’s defeat would not signal an end to his committee’s investigation of her email practices and handling of classified information while in government. But there’s no evidence Trump has personally urged him to keep the pressure up. Our ruling A number of bloggers said President Trump greenlighted Congress to ramp up the Clinton investigation -- and used a video clip of Chaffetz to advance this claim. But these bloggers have mischaracterized the video. In it, Chaffetz describes a meeting in which Trump offered general words of encouragement and emphasized the importance of Congress’ oversight function, without reference to Clinton, or any specific investigation. At no point in the video does Chaffetz say Trump greenlighted, encouraged or even hinted at the need to ramp up an investigation into Clinton. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

Mark Pocan's errant claim about tax breaks in Wisconsin's school voucher program for low-income kids
","U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan tried to grill U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos about a program he opposes: vouchers that use taxpayer dollars to send low-income children to private schools. But while posing questions to DeVos at a House subcommittee hearing on May 24, 2017, the Madison-area Democrat made a claim that mixed up the long-standing voucher program in Wisconsin with a relatively new private school tax break that’s offered to people of all income levels. ""The last expansion in Wisconsin of this program -- 75 percent of the parents who got this money, their kids already attended the schools,"" Pocan said, after criticizing the voucher program at length. ""And two-thirds of the money that went in the tax vouchers to the folks who receive this were making more than $100,000. So, largely, this is tax policy, this isn't education policy."" The $100,000 claim is in reference to a tax break for people who themselves pay to send their children to private schools, not the voucher program. The voucher program The 2013-’15 state budget made more Wisconsin children eligible for the voucher program, which dates back to 1989, when Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson and a Democratic-majority Legislature created the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, the nation's first urban school voucher program of its kind in the country. Its aim was to improve results for poor city children in public schools by allowing them to attend private or religious schools with publicly funded vouchers. To be eligible for the vouchers -- tax dollars paid to the private schools for tuition -- families must meet income limits. For the 2017-’18 school year, the limit for a family of four is $72,900 for students in Milwaukee and Racine and $44,955 for other parts of the state. The tax credit Unlike the voucher program, there are no income limits to qualify for the tax break, which reduces the taxable income for families who send their kids to private schools. The break also was created as part of the 2013-’15 state budget. Taxpayers can subtract from their income amounts paid to private schools for tuition and mandatory student fees. For each student in kindergarten through eighth grade, the maximum deduction is $4,000; for each student in high school, the maximum is $10,000. Pocan’s office told us the congressman made his claim based on a January 2017 news article in the Wisconsin State Journal. It says that in 2015, almost $8 million of the $12 million tax cut, or two-thirds, went to tax filers making more than $100,000. That amounted to about $388 per filer. But the tax break has nothing to do with the voucher program. Our rating While criticizing Wisconsin’s school voucher program, Pocan said ""two-thirds of the money"" in Wisconsin’s school ""tax vouchers"" went to people ""making more than $100,000.""

Pants On Fire for distorted claim about Jerry Brown's role in state probe
","A conservative news website with a penchant for phony claims recently alleged California Gov. Jerry Brown was ""caught in the middle"" of a huge corruption probe. The April 17, 2017 headline on consjournal.com read ""CA Gov. Jerry Brown Caught in the Middle of a $60 Billion Corruption Investigation."" Just below the headline is a giant, blaring graphic reading ""BREAKING NEWS."" If correct, this would be a seismic story across California and the nation. We set out to see if there’s even a hint of truth in this claim. Our research The article cites news reports in the Sacramento Bee and Los Angeles Times that detail a very real investigation Brown ordered into the Board of Equalization. The governor asked state prosecutors in April to examine claims that employees of the state tax agency misused state resources. The agency is headed by a five-person independent board elected by the public. The governor’s call for action followed an audit by his administration that uncovered mismanagement in the tax agency, which is responsible for collecting $60 billion in taxes annually. Nothing, however, in the consjournal.com article or the Bee or the Times suggest that Brown is a subject of that investigation as the headline strongly implies. We asked consjournal.com for evidence Brown was ‘caught in the middle’ of the probe. A representative emailed a link to an article by Breitbart.com, another conservative website, that summarizes the governor’s call for an investigation, but says nothing about Brown being a subject of it. The headline also caught the attention of the fact-checking website Snopes.com, which gave the claim its most severe rating, False. It added ""the story didn’t stand up to the barest of scrutiny."" Other wild claims The website’s claim about the governor is comparable to other ridiculous claims on consjournal.com. In October 2015, the website published an article with a reckless headline saying ""BREAKING: Illegal Aliens In California Able To VOTE, New Bill Just Signed."" It referred to Brown’s signing of the state’s New Motor Voter Law that registers eligible citizens to vote when they obtain or renew their driver’s license. There is a separate process that allows people in the country illegally to obtain a California driver’s license. Those individuals are not given the option to register to vote. ""We’ve built the protocols and the firewalls to not register people that aren’t eligible,"" Alex Padilla, the state’s top elections official told the Los Angeles Times in 2015. ""We’re going to keep those firewalls in place."" In March 2016, the website also published a misleading headline saying ""California Gov. Jerry Brown Says If Trump Is Elected He Will Build A Wall Around The State."" Several lines into the article, it notes Brown added: ""By the way that is a joke.

McCaskill is on the mark with steel industry
","As a candidate, President Donald Trump made trade fairness a signature issue, criticizing countries like China for ""dumping"" artificially cheap steel in U.S. markets and blaming the practice for a loss of American jobs. One day before Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago estate in April, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill issued a news release urging president Trump to address the issue of steel dumping. McCaskill backed up her comments by saying, ""Due to the recent downturn in steel production, more than 13,600 Americans have been laid off and the steel industry is facing billions in losses."" Those are some big numbers McCaskill threw out there, so we set out to see if they were accurate. What we found may be worse than what McCaskill originally thought. Jobs are going away The first part of Sen. McCaskill’s statement, ""More than 13,600 Americans have been laid off,"" is accurate. When PolitiFact Missouri asked McCaskill’s office for the supporting data, her press secretary offered a spreadsheet from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ website tracking the amount of steel mill jobs on a monthly basis. Her press secretary said the 13,600 figure was between January 2015 and May 2016. In January 2015, 153,500 Americans were employed in steel mills. By May 2016, that number had fallen to 139,900. But it’s important to note that the loss of steel jobs in America isn’t a recent trend. In fact, more than 20,000 steel jobs have been lost in the U.S. since the start of 2007. Historical data paint a grim picture of the state of steel jobs in America. According to the BLS, all ""primary metals"" jobs have dropped from 688,000 in 1990 to just 379,000 by March of 2017. In other words, in the past 27 years, nearly half of the metal-related jobs in America have been eliminated. Why are jobs disappearing? A common reason offered as to why steel jobs are leaving is that countries, primarily China, participate in ""steel dumping."" Dumping is when a country sells goods outside its home market for a cheaper rate than they are sold in the home country. Despite dumping being illegal since the 1940s, it remains an issue in the steel industry. ""We’ve seen pretty significant job loss, which we believe is attributable to the global trade problem,"" said Kevin Dempsey, the senior vice president for public policy at the American Iron and Steel Institute. ""There’s a big crisis with massive steel overcapacity. High levels of imports have led to (U.S.) steel mills being shut down."" Dempsey said efforts to address the issue have been underway for some time. The issue was a hot topic at last year’s G20 summit. And a global forum on steel access capacity meets on a regular basis as it tries to stop the ""underlying policy problems"" facing the country, according to Dempsey. Trump is expected to sign an executive order barring steel dumping. ""It’s really tough going because no country wants to bear all the pain of that,"" Dempsey said. ""China is reluctant to make changes, but we’re going to continue on pressing to change that."" What kind of shape is the steel industry in? The second part of McCaskill’s claim states: ""The steel industry is facing billions in losses."" While McCaskill’s press secretary did not offer data on the profit losses of the steel industry, our own research paints a dark picture. Steel dumping has crushed the profits of the U.S. steel industry. Low demand and large debt burdens are also challenging domestic producers. US Steel revenues went from $17.5 billion in 2014 to $11.5 billion in 2015. Revenue declined 13 percent at Steel Dynamics. Labor relations problems cut Allegheny Technologies’ bottom line in 2015. The list of companies that have lost significant money in the steel industry goes on and on. Our ruling McCaskill said, ""Due to the recent downturn in steel production, more than 13,600 Americans have been laid off and the steel industry is facing billions in losses."" Both parts of the senator’s statements have been proven accurate as forces like steel dumping have led to job cuts and billions of dollars of losses in America.

Pants on Fire! Bloggers claim Obama canceled, Trump revived 'police week'

""Obama didn’t want to offend anyone, so our country’s heroes were shut out. Not anymore,"" reads a post on theexaminer.site that we also found on guerilla.news. ""President Trump made Barack Obama look like a complete fool this morning in front of more than 10,000 police veterans when he announced that he would reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers that the traitor before him had done away with,"" the story continues. The story then allegedly quotes Trump as saying, ""Police officers in this country will no longer be treated like criminals. Obama decided your fallen didn’t deserve to be honored. That changes today. Americans will remember those that keep our streets safe big time."" However, the Trump quote is fabricated, as is the premise of the story. The national day of remembrance for police officers killed in the line of the duty currently falls on May 15 each year. It is called Peace Officers Memorial Day. Obama did not cancel the day, and Trump did not reinstate it. It was started in 1962 by President John F. Kennedy as part of ""police week.""  It has been celebrated by presidents -- including Obama and Trump -- ever since. Obama made remarks at a memorial service in May 2013, honoring the death of Jupiter, Fla., motorcycle police officer Bruce St. Laurent, who was struck and killed as part of a presidential motorcade in September 2012. ""I have the privilege of working with some of the nation’s finest law enforcement officers and professionals every day,"" Obama said. ""And I’m perpetually mindful of the sacrifices they make for me and for my family, and for other leaders and visiting dignitaries, but never more so than when I was told that Officer St. Laurent was struck and killed by another vehicle while driving his motorcycle as part of my motorcade."" Obama also spoke at a memorial service in May 2015. ""We are here to honor heroes who lost their lives in the line of duty -- men and women who put themselves in the way of danger, so that the rest of us could live in safety,"" Obama said in 2015. ""They were beat cops, deputies, detectives, correctional and forest service officers, federal agents and tribal police.  But to many here today, they went by different titles:  caring husband, loving wife, my son, my daughter, Mom, Dad. We also found electronic copies of the proclamations Obama signed designating ""police week"" in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Trump, like other presidents, continued the tradition in 2017. He spoke at a memorial service but did not mention Obama. ""America as a nation must always have the clarity to know the difference between good and evil, between right and wrong, and between those who uphold our laws and those who so easily break them,"" Trump said.

HHS Secretary Tom Price says 'hundreds of millions' more already spent to fight opioid addiction
","President Donald Trump has made a lot of promises to solve the country’s opioid crisis, which killed over 33,000 people in 2015 alone. They included the pledge to build a wall on the southern border to stop the flow of drugs from Mexico and Latin America and more money to accelerate new treatment and prevention programs. Secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services Tom Price and Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway reiterated Trump’s commitment to end the opioid crisis this month, as they visited New Hampshire - a state that has been one of the hardest hit by drug deaths. Their visit came a week after it was announced that the Trump administration had been planning to gut the Office of National Drug Control Policy, slashing the long-running agency's budget by $364 million, or about 95 percent, in its proposed budget. As it turned out, they did not go through with such a steep cut in Trump’s final budget. Asked about the proposed cuts, Price said, ""I think if you look at the entire federal government and the president’s commitment to this challenge, you’ll see that there are actually hundreds of millions of dollars increase on this issue."" But do Trump’s proposals mesh with Price’s statements about increasing money for treatment, prevention and recovery? Crunching the numbers To get some clarity, we reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services to get a numbers breakdown. A spokesman for HHS responded, pointing to funding in the Congressional omnibus bill, the temporary spending measure to keep the government running that was passed in early May. ""At minimum, the Omnibus provides $213 million in new funding to combat the opioid epidemic across the federal government,"" Alleigh Marre said. ""With all that in mind, the Secretary’s comment that there is a ‘hundreds of millions of dollars increase’ across the federal government, is true."" However, that number includes money that was passed by Congress in 2016, before Trump was president, and doesn’t account for the president’s proposed federal budget. Here’s the breakdown of what’s in that number: $500 million in 21st Century Cures Act grant money, which was passed by Congress under President Obama. $150 million as part of the 2017 omnibus, which includes money for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Health Resources and Services Administration to fight addiction. Marre also highlighted $12.5 million in funding for four new heroin enforcement groups within the DEA and $50 million to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to fund opioid and substance abuse prevention and treatment programs.   But since Price cited Trump’s commitment to combat the opioid crisis, it’s important to note what money was approved before he took office. Budget and health care bill Beyond these budget increases, however, experts on addiction and recovery say that other proposals by Trump won’t help ease the opioid crisis and could actually make it worse. His budget is asking for almost $400 million in cuts to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which could result in fewer mental health block grants being distributed. And the recently proposed Republican health care bill, which Trump supports, proposes drastic cuts to Medicaid. The House bill calls for $800 billion of cuts to Medicaid in 10 years, on top of the $610 billion cut to Medicaid benefits sought in Trump’s budget. That means Medicaid spending could be cut by 45 percent in 10 years. This has serious implications for people who get health insurance through expanded Medicaid in New Hampshire and elsewhere, many of whom get mental health treatment and substance abuse coverage paid. And that has many treatment advocates in New Hampshire worried. ""We need a system of response that includes access to treatment, recovery, and also, we have to address the supply side through supporting law enforcement in their work. I’m not seeing evidence that that’s actually happening,"" said Linda Saunders Paquette, director of treatment advocacy organization New Futures. It’s worth noting that the president’s budget is just a blueprint; members of Congress have said they are unlikely to approve the spending plan as written. Our Ruling Citing Trump’s commitment to fight the country’s opioid crisis, Price said the government is already spending ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" more to that end. More funding was approved in the recent Congressional omnibus bill to keep the government running, but other policies he’s seeking to pursue -- notably cuts to Medicaid -- could wipe out that increase and then some.

Did Donald Trump's trip create or save 'millions' of jobs?
","In a tweet from his first foreign trip as president, President Donald Trump touted his accomplishments on one of the cornerstones of his presidential campaign -- jobs. Trump traveled to Saudi Arabia, Israel, Brussels and Rome on a mix of business and diplomatic tasks from May 20 to May 27. ""Just arrived in Italy for the G7. Trip has been very successful. We made and saved the USA many billions of dollars and millions of jobs,"" Trump tweeted. Just arrived in Italy for the G7. Trip has been very successful. We made and saved the USA many billions of dollars and millions of jobs. Millions of jobs? That would be a massive shot in the arm for the economy. For a sense of scale, Wal-Mart, the nation’s largest private employer, has 2.3 million employees; the second-largest, Yum Brands, which includes Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, has about 500,000. The problem is, the White House has been cagey about exactly where this projection comes from. For starters, Trump’s use of the word ""millions"" represents a thousand-fold expansion from what Trump had said just days earlier, when he told the audience in a speech in Saudi Arabia: ""Yesterday, we signed historic agreements with the Kingdom that will invest almost $400 billion in our two countries and create many thousands of jobs in America and Saudi Arabia."" Meanwhile, over two days of inquiries to the White House, officials were unable to provide us with full details of the $110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia, which itself is just a portion of the $400 billion investment package Trump cited in his speech. When the Washington Post Fact Checker asked the White House for details about Trump’s tweet, a White House official responded that Trump was referring to ""benefits to trade from the entire trip from Saudi Arabia to the G7"" -- that is, including Trump’s meetings with the heads of other advanced industrialized nations in Europe toward the end of the trip. (It’s not clear what trade deals were discussed in the European portion of the trip.) In any case, assuming ""millions"" of jobs from unspecified investments is not justified, economists say. ""There’s not enough information to substantiate his claims on millions of jobs,"" said Chris Lafakis, senior economist at Moody’s. In the meantime, here’s what we know and don’t know. The arms deal The Defense Security Cooperation Agency issued a news release on May 20 saying that the United States and Saudi Arabia agreed to a $110 billion package on five main areas: border security and counterterrorism, maritime and coastal security, air force modernization, air and missile defense, and cybersecurity and communications upgrades. The release detailed six specific areas, with links to documents that offered a dollar amount. They were: • Munitions and support: $6.8 billion; • Multi-Mission Surface Combatant ships: $11.25 billion; • Ammunition for the Royal Saudi Land Forces: $500 million; • Saudi Abrams Main Battle Tanks and HERCULES Armored Recovery Vehicles: $1.15 billion; • Chinook cargo helicopters: $3.51 billion; • Persistent Threat Detection System Aerostats: $525 million. That totals $23.74 billion, leaving $86 billion from the package unspecified. Using other available data, John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, told PolitiFact that he can estimate perhaps $50 billion in arms sales, ""most of which was initiated under Obama,"" he said. Bloomberg calculations Reporters at Bloomberg have written several articles about the deals signed in the Saudi portion of the trip, focusing on agreements outside the $110 billion arms deal. They include: • Agreements signed by Saudi oil company Aramco: $50 billion; • Commitments by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund to an infrastructure investment fund with the Blackstone Group. (Blackstone, Bloomberg reported separately, has close ties to the family of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.) $20 billion; • General Electric memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia: $15 billion; • Honeywell International memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco: $3.6 billion; • McDermott International memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco: $2.8 billion; • Jacobs Engineering Group memorandum of understanding: $250 million; • Rowan Companies memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco for offshore drilling rigs: $7 billion; • Rowan memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco for its supply chain: $1.2 billion; • Nabors Industries memorandum of understanding on well and rig services on an existing joint venture worth $9 billion; • Nabors memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco for its supply chain: $1.6 billion; • Weatherford International memorandum of understanding: potential value of $2 billion. That works out to about $112 billion, coming on top of the $110 billion in arms sales. Bloomberg cited a few more items without specific dollar amounts, including a jet purchase from Boeing by SaudiGulf Airlines, and a joint venture between National Oilwell Varco and Saudi Aramco for the manufacture of drilling rigs and equipment. That leaves more than half of Trump’s $400 billion figure -- just for the Saudi leg of the trip -- undisclosed, to say nothing of what deals may have been struck in the European portion of the trip. And for now, the Washington Post reported that several key CEOs of companies that signed deals have been a lot more restrained than Trump about promising specific numbers of jobs. ""There is absolutely zero chance that the trip created millions of jobs,"" said Dean Baker, a liberal economist. Even if jobs were created -- possibly in the thousands, not the millions -- ""this may or may not lead to any net job creation, since the Fed could easily offset it with higher interest rates."" Our ruling Trump said that deals struck on his first foreign trip as president created and saved ""millions of jobs."" We can’t know for sure how many jobs will be created or saved -- nor, despite the certainty of his language, does Trump -- but the evidence at this point is so thin and so premature as to be little more than puffery or wishful thinking.

Conspiracy theory that Comey hid Seth Rich’s ties to WikiLeaks based on retracted story
","A conspiracy theory that said former FBI director James Comey was covering up the source of leaked Democratic National Committee emails for Hillary Clinton is based on a single source that has admitted he had no evidence. The headline on a May 16, 2017, post on PatriotCrier.com read, ""Bombshell: Comey knew murdered DNC staffer, Seth Rich, was WikiLeaks source & covered it up for Hillary."" Facebook users flagged the story in an effort to identify potential fake news. The post is based on a persistent and unfounded conspiracy theory about how the website WikiLeaks came by thousands of internal DNC emails during last year’s presidential election. Seth Rich was a 27-year-old voter access projects staffer for the DNC who was shot and killed near his Washington home on July 10, 2016. The case is still unsolved, but Washington police said it was probably a botched robbery. WikiLeaks published thousands of emails a few days after Rich’s death. Some conspiracy theorists have concluded that Rich must have been the one who leaked the emails, and was killed to scare other potential leakers. WikiLeaks offered $20,000 for more information about Rich’s death, drawing some attention to the scenario. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has never said Rich was the source. On May 15, Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by Rich’s family, claimed he could prove Rich was indeed the source of the leak. He told Washington-area Fox affiliate WTTG that sources in the FBI said they had evidence proving it. The next day, Fox News reported an anonymous federal investigator backed up what Wheeler was saying. This official said the FBI had determined Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks, sending them more than 40,000 DNC emails. Most of the PatriotCrier.com conspiracy theory is based on this unfounded insistence that the FBI has proof of this connection. ""It’s apparent that Wheeler was being guarded in giving his statement, but the fact is the FBI has been in possession of Rich’s laptop and the agency’s director at the time, James Comey, locked down the contents to protect either certain people at the DNC, or members of Hillary’s campaign team, or Hillary Clinton, or likely all three,"" the PatriotCrier.com post read. There is no contact information on PatriotCrier.com, and we did not receive a response when we contacted the site through an affiliated Facebook page. The site’s registration information is hidden. It’s quite a stretch to pin on an anonymous federal investigator that Comey examined the evidence, drew a conclusion that proved Rich was the WikiLeaks source and then hid it specifically to protect Clinton. Wheeler didn’t even mention the former FBI director, and we didn’t find any evidence of Comey commenting on Rich’s death. The entire conspiracy theory had been under the radar, confined to corners of the Internet, until Wheeler’s story emerged, by which time Comey had been fired by President Donald Trump. But the more egregious problem with the PatriotCrier.com post is that it didn’t include what happened next: Wheeler admitted to CNN on March 16 that he had actually gotten the information from the Fox News reporter to whom he had discussed the issue. The Rich family sent Wheeler a cease-and-desist letter, saying their son was not WikiLeaks’ source. They also demanded retractions from Fox for reporting the story. Fox News eventually retracted its story and removed it from FoxNews.com. WTTG posted a follow-up to its story, saying Wheeler had backtracked on what he described as a ""miscommunication."" The FBI has not officially acknowledged conducting an investigation (a WhiteHouse.gov petition demanding Comey get involved was created in January 2017, but has so far only garnered about 1,000 signatures). Some media outlets have reported that anonymous FBI and law enforcement officials confirmed the agency is not investigating Rich’s death, and that Washington police never gave them Rich’s laptop and therefore the agency hadn’t examined its contents. An FBI spokeswoman confirmed only that Rich's death was being investigated by the Metropolitan Police Department. What the FBI did do is alert the DNC of a data breach prior to the WikiLeaks release, and subsequently connected the breach to hackers with Russian ties. The only other source even remotely supporting the idea Rich was involved is a hacker living in New Zealand named Kim Dotcom. He said someone going by the name of Panda had contacted him in 2014 to get help starting a political group in the United States. Dotcom said he is certain Panda was actually Rich, and knows that Rich was the WikiLeaks source. He has not shown any proof. Dotcom is currently facing extradition to the United States on a host of conspiracy and racketeering charges levied by the Justice Department. Rich’s family also has denied the link Dotcom is making between Rich and WikiLeaks, and has said Dotcom actually tried to plant bogus evidence implicating Rich. And in any event, the PatriotCrier.com post didn’t make any mention of Dotcom or his claims. The Metropolitan Police Department, meanwhile, is still investigating Rich’s death as a homicide. PatriotCrier.com said, ""Comey knew murdered DNC staffer, Seth Rich, was WikiLeaks source and covered it up for Hillary."" The website’s assertion that Comey knew Rich was WikiLeaks’ source of the DNC emails and hid the evidence to protect Clinton is a wild assumption based on refuted evidence. A private investigator had claimed that the FBI had analyzed Rich’s laptop and found proof that he had given the emails to WikiLeaks, but then recanted his story. Fox News and its network affiliate, which had broadcast the story, later retracted it. There’s no evidence there’s any link between Rich and WikiLeaks. The FBI has indirectly denied investigating the case, which Washington police consider a robbery gone wrong. With no concrete proof of this far-fetched claim, we rate it Pants On Fire! Editor's note: Shortly after this fact-check was published, an FBI spokeswoman officially confirmed that Rich's death was being investigated by the Metropolitan Police Department.

GOP attack ad twists Ossoff donation sources in Georgia race
","Both sides have launched attack ads in the race for Georgia’s 6th Congressional District. Recently, Democrats accused Republican Karen Handel of wallowing in administrative bloat. (We rated that Mostly False). Now, the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, has an ad that paints Democrat Jon Ossoff as beholden more to people in California than voters in Georgia. It is running in the Atlanta area as part of the super PAC’s $6.7 million independent expenditure. Shot against iconic backdrops of San Francisco, actors, each one the most stereotypical of ""left coast"" stereotypes, speak cheerfully about Ossoff. A young woman with a floppy hat and a big ""Cut the military now"" button says, ""There’s a reason Bay Area liberals have contributed more to Jon Ossoff’s campaign than people in Georgia. He’s one of us."" Another young woman stands in front of the Golden Gate Bridge and says ""San Francisco hearts Ossoff."" With a coy toss of her ponytails, she makes a heart with her hands and presses them to her chest. Set aside the political snark and you have this factual claim: San Francisco ""Bay Area liberals have given more to Jon Ossoff's campaign than people in Georgia."" Is it so? The Congressional Leadership Fund said they got their information from the Mercury News, a prominent local paper. An April 12 article said, ""Ossoff reported 2,628 individual donations from people living in the nine Bay Area counties, significantly more than from all of Georgia — although of a smaller total value."" Here’s how the numbers shook out at the end of March when the data behind the article was collected. (The dollar total for Bay Area residents wasn’t in the article. We calculated it based on the same data.) State Number of donors Dollars (through March 31, 2017) Georgia 1,578 $600,141 California 5,822 $547,857 Bay Area 2,628 $290,229 (PolitiFact calculation) So first off, the article doesn’t back up what the ad said, that people in the Bay Area gave more to Ossoff than people in Georgia. In fact, as the original article noted, Georgians gave more money to Ossoff than people from California. As for people in the Bay Area, we found that they gave half as much compared to voters in Georgia. (More people from the Bay Area contributed than from Georgia, but that’s not what the ad claimed.) Of course, it’s also important to note that the ad relies on information that is now nearly two months old. In truth, there’s only so much more to learn. The last public report was on April 16. With help from staff at the Center for Responsive Politics, we updated the totals. Georgia remained in the lead, by about $640,000 compared to about $321,000 from the Bay area. It’s also worth noting that donations under $200 are not required to be itemized under Federal Election Commission rules, meaning we don’t know where those donors live. That accounts for about two-thirds of Ossoff’s donations through the end of March. The Conservative Leadership Fund is running an ad that says ""Bay Area liberals have given more to Jon Ossoff's campaign than people in Georgia."" In fact, based on data available through mid April, people in Georgia have given Ossoff twice as much money as people in the Bay Area. The one trace of accuracy is that Bay Area donors outnumber Ossoff’s Georgia donors, but the ad failed to describe the donations in those terms.

Has tough-on-crime Sheriff David Clarke cut the number of his deputies by half or more?
","Has tough-talking Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., who has apparently landed a post in the administration of President Donald Trump, actually slashed the number of his deputies by half or more? That’s the attack from Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele, the millionaire son of the co-founder of the Boston Scientific medical device company and a political nemesis of Clarke’s. On May 18, 2017, the day after after Clarke announced he would be joining the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as an assistant secretary, Abele was asked on WTMJ radio in Milwaukee what legacy Clarke would leave behind. (Clarke said he would take on his new post in June 2017, but the Trump administration has not confirmed Clarke’s announcement. Two days after Abele’s comments, CNN reported that Clarke plagiarized parts of his master’s thesis. Clarke has denied that accusation, but has said the report could kill his appointment.) Abele, who was once accused by Clarke of having ""penis envy,"" said Clarke’s legacies include reducing the number of deputies ""long before I was there from about 700 and something to 300 and something."" Given that Clarke, who calls himself ""America’s sheriff,"" has built a reputation on Fox News and elsewhere as being tough on crime, let’s see if Abele’s statement is on point. Sheriff’s role on crime Clarke’s national profile as a favorite of conservatives has risen largely because of his blunt comments on crime, among other topics. In a 2013 interview, he advised citizens, in the context of a home invasion, to ""point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger"" because ""911 is not our best option."" But given that all of Milwaukee County is served by city and village police departments, the role of the Sheriff’s Office isn’t on the front line as much in fighting crime. In 2011, we rated Half True a claim by Abele that the sheriff’s office ""plays only a limited role as a traditional law enforcement agency."" We noted at the time that Abele had proposed with his county budget cutting 240 positions from the sheriff’s office. That underscores an important point in weighing Abele’s claim: It’s the not the sheriff alone who determines how many deputies there will be. In the annual county budget process, the sheriff asks for a certain number of deputies; then the county executive recommends a number as part of an overall county budget proposal; and ultimately a number is authorized when the County Board of Supervisors approves the county budget. The numbers (Note: All of the deputy figures in this article are authorized positions, rather than an actual count of deputies, given that the number fluctuates with retirements, resignations, etc.) With the 2002 budget that Clarke inherited after he was elected, there were 649 deputy positions authorized for the sheriff’s office. In the 2011 budget, the final one before Abele took over as county executive, there were 328 deputy positions. The executive during those years was Wisconsin’s current governor, Republican Scott Walker. So, as far as the numbers go, Abele was high with the first part of his claim but on target with the second part. But the thrust of Abele’s claim is that Clarke reduced the deputy positions. This chart shows the number of deputies Clarke sought with his budget request; the number that were recommended by Walker with his full county budget proposal; and the number that were ultimately authorized in the final budget approved by the County Board. Again, we’re looking at the period before Abele took over as county executive. Year Deputies requested by sheriff Deputies recommended by county executive Deputies authorized by County Board 2003 * 627 625 2004 * 573 593 2005 * 588 588 2006 538 519 519 2007 443 443 475 2008 457 457 457 2009 439 435 435 2010 393 393 393 2011 328 328 328 *Not available The figures, from the county budget office, are incomplete for the first three years. The number of deputies ultimately authorized by the County Board dropped by 37 by 2005, but the figures don’t show whether Clarke requested any reductions. In any case, 2005 was an important year. In that budget, Clarke requested and the County Board approved, changing 200 positions in the county jail from deputies to lower-paid correctional officers. The change was not immediate; as deputies left the jail jobs, they were replaced by correctional officers. Over the next several years, the number of deputies steadily declined. In fact, Clarke requested fewer deputies than he did in the previous year in each year but one between 2006 and 2011 -- when he requested and was authorized 328 deputy positions. So, there were 649 authorized deputy positions when Clarke took office and only 328 by the time Abele took office. That’s a reduction of 321 deputy positions. But the reduction in total force was less, given that 200 of the deputies were jailers who were replaced by correctional officers. Our rating Abele said that before he took over as county executive, Clarke reduced the number of sheriff’s deputies from about 700 to about 300. The sheriff’s office had 649 authorized deputy positions when Clarke took office in 2003 and 328 in 2011, the final county budget before Abele took over. That’s a total reduction of 321. Incomplete county records don’t indicate whether deputy reductions during first three years were requested by Clarke or were simply made by the County Board. But in 2005, he requested and was granted a gradual turnover of 200 positions in the county jail from being deputies to lower-paid correctional officers. So, at least 200 of the 321 deputy reductions were specifically requested by Clarke, although those 200 deputies were jailers who were replaced by lower-paid correctional officers.

Lawmaker misleads with claim Jerry Brown has axed funds for California’s dying trees
","Republican Assemblyman Jim Patterson of Fresno recently claimed Gov. Jerry Brown has slashed nearly all the money in the state’s budget to help local governments remove dead and dying trees in California’s forests. More than 100 million trees have died in the forests due to drought and bark beetle infestations since 2010. The tree mortality crisis led Brown, a Democrat, to declare a state of emergency in October 2015. ""The Governor’s updated budget released on (May 11, 2017) cuts funds for local tree mortality efforts from $52.7 million to just $2 million,"" Patterson said in a press release on May 22, 2017. Patterson’s district includes towns in the Sierra National Forest and Kings Canyon National Park east of Fresno where the tree die-off is severe. If they fall, dead and dying trees can damage public roadways, water and power infrastructure and private homes and businesses. But removing them isn’t cheap: It can cost $1,000 or more for each tree. In response to the die-off, the state has reimbursed cities and counties for a portion of the cost to clear hazardous trees from public rights-of-way. Patterson’s statement makes it seem as if that program is being drastically scaled back. We decided to fact-check the assemblyman’s claim that the governor’s May budget ""cuts funds for local tree mortality efforts from $52.7 million to just $2 million.""  Trees dying from drought and beetle infestation in Mariposa County. Amy Quinton / Capital Public Radio Our research Patterson is referring to California Disaster Assistance Act funding. Some of his figures are correct, but perhaps not in context. Brown’s initial budget released in January indeed shows the governor set aside $52.7 million for this disaster assistance fund. It did not cite a specific amount for tree removal reimbursements. The governor’s revised May budget shows the overall disaster assistance fund was reduced to $8.5 million. It sets aside just $2 million for local agencies to remove dead or dying trees based on expected demand for that money, according to state officials. Brown, following record rainfall in California, declared an end to the state’s drought emergency in April. As a result, he scaled back his plans for emergency spending by more than $100 million in his updated budget. Patterson’s spokeswoman did not respond to questions about the claim. Looking again at the assemblyman’s statement, it’s simply not accurate to say the $52.7 million set aside in January for disaster funds was all intended to help with the tree die-off. ""A lot of that money was for the effects of drought, drinking water, community water sources. It was not just for tree mortality. Tree mortality is just one kind of disaster that could have requested reimbursements from that fund,"" said Janet Upton, deputy director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as CalFire. Upton said the $2 million figure is based on the state’s projections for how much local governments will seek in reimbursements in the coming fiscal year for the removal of dead and dying trees. Since the tree crisis started, local governments have requested less than $600,000 from the disaster fund for the removal costs, Upton added. She said the state would ensure all eligible requests by local governments are reimbursed even if the requests exceed the $2 million in the budget. ""If there was an unmet demand of $40 million, that would be a different story,"" Upton said.  File photo / Associated Press Requests to ramp up? Even so, the governor’s decision to reduce disaster funding is still worrisome, said Staci Heaton, who works for the Rural County Representatives of California. ""I think (the $2 million) is going to be a little low,"" said Heaton, whose organization advocates for many of the mountainous counties affected by the die-off. Heaton said she expects requests for tree removal reimbursements ""will ramp up,"" adding that rural counties see the reduction ""as a fairly big hit to local government aid."" Rural cities and counties aren’t the only ones removing the dying trees. And the disaster fund isn’t the only source of money that helps local governments. Here’s another example as outlined in the governor’s January budget: ""In December 2016, CalFire awarded $15.8 million in grants for a total of 107 projects across 34 counties to support local efforts to remove dead and dying trees that pose a threat to public health and safety and projects that reduce the threat of wildfires to homes."" In April, the San Francisco Chronicle reported: ""The governor’s emergency declaration for the forests has ushered in tens of millions of dollars to address safety issues. So far, roughly 500,000 trees have been removed and miles of fuel breaks have been cut in a joint effort by the Forest Service, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the California Department of Transportation and private utilities. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. alone removed 236,000 dead or dying trees last year."" Upton noted that nearly half of the $90 million CalFire had been receiving on a temporary basis each year to respond to the drought has now been converted into permanent annual funding. This allows the agency, she said, to continue its year-round staffing, which will focus in part on removing hazardous trees and easing the tree mortality crisis. Our ruling Republican State Assemblyman Jim Patterson recently claimed Gov. Jerry Brown’s May budget ""cuts funds for local tree mortality efforts from $52.7 million to just $2 million."" Patterson’s claim gets the $2 million figure correct. But it’s misleading and not accurate to say the entire $52.7 million was set aside to remove dead and dying trees. It’s a disaster assistance fund that also helps pay for water storage and sanitation projects across nine counties in California. Brown declared an end to the state’s drought emergency in April, a move that led the state to scale back some temporary emergency funding. Over the past couple years, local governments have requested less than $600,000 for tree removal reimbursements from the disaster assistance fund, though an advocate for rural counties expects requests will ramp up this year. Patterson taps into a real concern over tree mortality and its cost to local governments. But his statement cites a misleading budget number and ignores critical facts that would give a very different impression. We rate his claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Capital Public Radio's Insight program discussed this fact check and a separate national fact check on May 31, 2017. Listen to the discussion below:   UPDATE: We reached out to Patterson's office for this fact check but have yet to hear back directly. Two days after our report published, Patterson responded to it on Twitter. He said: ""The cuts are real, large & dangerous. People who live in the midst of this disaster are scared, and the counties they live in are too."" Also, in a separate press release last week, Patterson said a state Assembly budget committee had approved a $20 million increase to CalFire’s budget to fund dead tree removal and prescribed burns. He added that the same committee rejected his request to add $10 million for local tree mortality efforts.
