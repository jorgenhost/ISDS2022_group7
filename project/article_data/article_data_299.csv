State Sen. Taylor misfires with claim against Milwaukee Mayor Barrett on youth prisons
","Wisconsin’s juvenile correctional facilities have been in turmoil since about 2012, when the sexual assault of a Racine County youth was mishandled by officials at Lincoln Hills School for Boys. In February 2012, Racine County Circuit Judge Richard Kreul wrote to Gov. Scott Walker about one of his cases. Kreul wrote that a Lincoln Hills inmate from Racine was forced to perform a sex act on his roommate and then beaten unconscious. Lincoln Hills workers delayed getting the victim medical treatment for three hours because other inmates were playing a basketball game, according to reports. Racine County officials responded by pulling all their youth offenders from Lincoln Hills. Since then, there has been a string of additional scandals, and the state faces a Jan. 1, 2021 deadline to shutter the facility (Gov. Tony Evers has sought to extend that deadline). The plan calls for multiple regional facilities that are smaller than Lincoln Hills. One of two new youth prisons will be built in the Milwaukee area. But where should it be located? That has been a critical issue. The state has identified a location on city-owned land at North Teutonia Avenue and West Mill Road, just south of the city's Safety Academy. ""This decision was made without input from my office, the community or Milwaukee County and no further details have been provided about this facility,"" Common Council President Ashanti Hamilton said in a March 12, 2019 news release. The site is in Hamilton’s district. He hosted a March 14, 2019 community meeting, which was attended by about 100 residents and grew heated at times. Officials in nearby Glendale have also opposed the state’s selection of the Teutonia Avenue site.   At the meeting, state Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee, sharply criticized Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, describing him and his actions this way: ""The mayor who didn't want the children here in the first place, who has never been to a juvenile facility, who didn't want it to be done, should not be the voice at all."" That caught our attention, since Barrett had been a critic of Lincoln Hills, located in Irma in Lincoln County  --  about three and a half hours from Milwaukee -- and an advocate for creating a facility closer to the families of inmates. Is Taylor right that Barrett did not want a juvenile facility in Milwaukee, ""has never been to a juvenile facility,"" and didn't want it to be done at all? The background A spate of proposals, including community halfway houses and a 2018 proposal for Milwaukee County to open a treatment center for male teens on Milwaukee's north side, have come and gone, as officials struggled to find an appropriate location for a new facility. On March 12, 2019, Evers announced that two new youth facilities would be built: The Milwaukee one and one northwest of Appleton, in the town of Hortonia. Evers’ budget calls for spending nearly $200 million on the smaller replacement youth prison facilities. We reached out to Taylor’s office to seek backup for her claim, but her staff did not respond to repeated requests via phone and email. We did find a Feb. 9,  2016 FOX6 news report in which Barrett said he was in favor of protecting the youths from possible abuse at Lincoln Hills, but said ""I don’t want the ramifications of that to affect public safety in Milwaukee. I’m very concerned about that."" Does that amount to opposition? Sort of. At least at the time. The Barrett record When we reached out to Jodie Tabak, Barrett’s communications director, she noted things have changed since the 2016 news report. ""The idea being pushed at the time by the county was focused on group homes,"" Tabak said. ""At that time, Mayor Barrett expressed his concerns about violent offenders and violent repeat offenders who should be in a secure facility, closer to families, receiving services and not in group homes in neighborhoods."" As for Taylor’s three criticisms, here is a closer look: -- ""Didn’t want the children here in the first place."" In addition to the information above, on July 13, 2016, Barrett told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Lincoln Hills was a failed ""experiment."" He said he wanted the state to take immediate steps to reopen Ethan Allen School for Boys, the Waukesha County juvenile correctional facility shut down five years earlier by Gov. Walker. ""The question becomes what happens to the young people there. And some of the young people need to be in a secure facility,"" Barrett said at the time. ""And from a logistics standpoint, from a cost standpoint, from a programmatic standpoint, from a staffing standpoint, Ethan Allen provides an opportunity that must be explored very, very quickly."" Waukesha County officials objected, saying it would be too costly to reopen Ethan Allen. In any case, Barrett was on the record for being in favor of having the youth moved closer -- though not specifically in Milwaukee. -- ""Has never been to a juvenile facility."" On this point, Tabak said Barrett ""recently had dinner at a local facility where youth are under court order to be there, including those that have been to Lincoln Hills."" Tabak said the Nov. 14, 2018 dinner took place at Ujima House. In a March 7, 2019, opinion piece for Milwaukee Neighborhood News Service, Executive Director Jermaine Reed described Ujima House as ""a non-secure facility in the heart of the inner-city of Milwaukee."" In a telephone interview, Reed said although some of the youths do wear monitoring bracelets, the shelter is ""not a correctional facility"" but ""our services are sometimes used as an alternative to corrections. We have had youth on a GPS monitoring system. If they violate their conditions of release they could be sent to detention or possibly Lincoln Hills."" So, the visit to Ujima House was to something very different than to a Lincoln Hills-style facility. In a followup email, Tabak said the mayor has visited several correctional facilities. ""He has been to St. Rose’s, Lakeside (St. A’s), State Correctional Facility in Racine, Taycheedah, Vel Phillips Center, Felmers Chaney Center in the heart of the City, the County corrections facility in Franklin, the downtown jail and Waupun. He has not been to Lincoln Hills, but he’s obviously been to many juvenile and adult corrections facilities."" -- Who ""didn't want it to be done."" As noted, Barrett initially proposed reopening Ethan Allen, in Waukesha County’s Town of Delafield. Two years later, Barrett had dropped the Waukesha County idea and supported a Milwaukee facility. Our rating Taylor said Tom Barrett did not want a juvenile facility in Milwaukee, ""has never been to a juvenile facility"" and ""didn't want it to be done."" The mayor was opposed to early plans, but mainly because of concerns about the possibility of violent offenders being placed in neighborhood group homes instead of a secure facility. While he initially suggested reopening Ethan Allen in Waukesha County, he has backed a city site. As for the visit to a juvenile facility, while Ujima House is a far cry from Lincoln Hills, the mayor has visited numerous other facilities. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2019/apr/02/lena-taylor/state-sen-taylor-misfires-claim-against-milwaukee-/

Harriet Tubman never said she could have freed more slaves ‘if only they knew they were slaves’
","Discredit a quote and it still shows up online. That’s what is happening with a viral post that alleges the great abolitionist Harriet Tubman said she believed she could have freed more slaves if only they ""knew"" they were slaves. A post recently shared to Facebook features an image of Tubman alongside the quote, which says: ""I freed a thousand slaves. I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew they were slaves."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While the quote has been debunked as fake before, it continues to get re-posted on social media. There is no evidence that Tubman said this, and while she has been credited with liberating hundreds of slaves (not thousands) on the Underground Railroad in the past, historians now say the number of people she personally guided to freedom is closer to 70 or 80. Kate Clifford Larson is a historian and Tubman scholar who authored the biography, ""Bound For the Promised Land: Harriet Tubman, Portrait of an American Hero."" Larson told PolitiFact Tubman never made that statement. ""Tubman never said this. I think the phrase started making the rounds back in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It is ridiculous in the extreme. Of course enslaved people knew they were enslaved. All of them wanted to be free,"" Larson wrote in an email. She said Tubman herself rescued about 70 people on the Underground Railroad and, with the help of about 150 black soldiers helped liberate 750 enslaved people from plantations on the Combahee River in South Carolina during a raid in June 1863. A spring 2008 article in the Maxwell Perspective, a magazine of the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, traced some of the confusion to feminist political analyst Robin Morgan. During the 2008 presidential primary matchup between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, Morgan wrote a follow-up to her famous 1970 essay ""Goodbye to All That."" Challenging women who didn’t support Clinton, Morgan wrote, ""Let a statement by the magnificent Harriet Tubman stand as reply. When asked how she managed to save hundreds of enslaved African Americans via the Underground Railroad during the Civil War, she replied bitterly, ‘I could have saved thousands—if only I’d been able to convince them they were slaves.’"" The Maxwell Perspective also found the quote to be inauthentic, and several scholars who studied Tubman were unable to locate a primary source for the statement.

No, Bernie Sanders did not say ‘Christianity is an insult to Muslims’
","In 2017, Sen. Bernie Sanders had some things to say during the nomination hearing for the next deputy director of the White House’s budget office.

During the entire exchange, though, Sanders did not say, ""Christianity is an insult to Muslims,"" as social media posts and conservative websites have claimed.

Vought’s January 2016 piece focused on Wheaton College’s decision to fire a professor who, as Vought puts it, expressed ""controversial comments seeking solidarity with Muslims and her argument that Christians ‘worship the same God.’ "" Vought defended the college’s decision, and wrote, ""Muslims do not simply have a deficient theology. They do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ his Son, and they stand condemned."" Sanders took issue with this during the hearing (around 44:30) and asked Vought if he believed the statement was Islamophobic. ""Absolutely not,"" Vought responded. He went on to say he is a Christian and believes in a Christian set of principles. The two went back and forth, and at one point Sanders said: ""In my view, the statement made by Mr. Vought is indefensible, it is hateful, it is Islamophobic, and it is an insult to over a billion Muslims throughout the world."" The debate ended at an impasse, with Sanders saying he will vote no. (Which he did, but with a tally of 49-49, Vice President Mike Pence’s tie-breaking vote pushed Vought through.) Various media outlets reported on the exchange, and some condemned Sanders' comments as a religious test for public office, which is barred in the U.S. Constitution (Article VI).

Viral meme about Al Gore and glaciers is wrong
","Former vice president Al Gore has used his celebrity to try to curb the worst consequences of climate change. The 2006 movie ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" for example, follows Gore as he discusses the dangers of global warming. A recent Facebook post seems to play on that film title with a claim about glaciers. ""The day Al Gore was born, there were 130,000 glaciers on earth,"" reads the text of a Facebook post featuring pictures of the veep. ""Today, only 130,000 remain."" ""Awkward,"" wrote the Facebook account that published the post on March 11. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We turned to research and climate scientists to help us figure out if it’s accurate. What’s a glacier?  A glacier is a body of snow and ice that’s big enough in size and mass to move under its own weight, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. But what qualifies as a glacier depends on who you ask. The USGS defines them ""according to the commonly accepted guidelines in which a body of ice has an area of at least 0.1 kilometers squared, or about 25 acres."" But that’s not universal. Over in Argentina, for example, a grassroots group challenged the size cutoff for a glacier to be included in the country’s national inventory, arguing it has imperiled important water sources. And a recent study in the journal Nature discusses sea level rise from uncharted glaciers, ones that disappeared before they were documented or are ""missing,"" meaning they’re too small to be included in inventories. William Colgan, a senior researcher with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, told PolitiFact that the emerging global standard for defining a glacier is a minimum of 1 hectare, or 100 meters by 100 meters. How many glaciers were there in 1948? According to Colgan, we don’t know what the global number of glaciers was in 1948, the year Al Gore was born. Scientists use satellites to map glaciers and reliable satellite monitoring didn’t start until the mid 1980s. ""We just don’t have the snapshots from space in 1948,"" Colgan said. How many glaciers are there today? We do have estimates of the total number of glaciers today. According to the Randolph Glacier Inventory, Colgan said, there are 197,654 glaciers that are at least 1 hectare, or 0.01 square kilometers. That’s 67,654 more than the Facebook post says, not counting the thousands of ""missing"" glaciers, Colgan said. Walt Meier, a research scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center, told PolitiFact that inventories are always changing. The numbers could increase because more glaciers are getting mapped, he said. One database on the center’s website lists 306,865 glaciers, for example. Michael Kemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service, cited 215,000 glaciers today. He said in an email that the number 130,000 probably comes from the World Glacier Inventory, which is a snapshot of the glacier distribution in the second half of the 20th century. But, Kemp said, it’s not globally complete. How have glaciers changed over the decades?  Kemp said that though it’s clear glaciers have been shrinking worldwide since the mid 19th century, the number of glaciers may not have changed much. That’s because while some glaciers have vanished altogether, others have ""disintegrated from one large glacier complex into smaller tributary glaciers."" Jim White, a climate scientist and interim dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder, said a better measure of glacier change is ice volume, because that translates to potential sea level rise if that ice melts. ""Satellites give us area, not volume, so numbers of glaciers is interesting but volume change is more important for Miami,"" he said. (The coastal city is vulnerable to sea level rise.) How much ice have we lost since Al Gore was born?  Citing a 2017 Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme study Colgan worked on, he said the world has lost about 33,000 gigatons of ice since 1948. To put a gigaton in perspective, scientists estimate we’re losing 159 gigatons of ice from Antarctica each year, according to the Washington Post. That’s about a third of all the water in Lake Erie. ""The changes are so great with land ice, it’s like the poster child of climate change,"" Colgan said. ""Everywhere you look, you see massive change."" Consider Glacier National Park, in Montana. In an undated post about the park, the U.S. Geological Survey says there were an estimated approximate 150 glaciers in 1850. Most of those glaciers were still there when the park was established in 1910. But by 2015, there were 26 remaining glaciers larger than 25 acres. Glaciers are dynamic. They respond to temperature and precipitation. But they retreat when melting outpaces the accumulation of new snow. And, USGS notes, ""worldwide glacial glacier recession is well documented."" ""Early park visitors and scientists noted that glaciers were retreating as early as 1914,"" according to the post. ""The climate was already warming and glaciers were responding, but the industrial revolution added more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, furthering glacier retreat."" All glaciers have reduced in size in the park since 1966, according to USGS, and some had retreated as much 85 percent by 2015. (You can see photos showing how the Shepard Glacier in the park has changed from 1913 to 2005.) Our ruling The Facebook post claims that there were 130,000 glaciers in 1948 and there are 130,000 glaciers today. We don’t know how many glaciers there were in 1948, and there are actually tens of thousands more glaciers worldwide today than the post says. But context matters here, and the post suggests that glaciers haven’t changed in the 70 years since Al Gore was born. That’s also incorrect. As Walt Meier, the research scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center, told us, ""the number of glaciers isn’t really relevant in terms of assessing climate change."" What matters, he said, is the change in mass. ""Are glaciers as a whole gaining or losing ice?"" he asked. ""On that question, the answer is very clear — glaciers are losing mass.""

Del. Kaye Kory way off about surge of women prisoners in Virginia
","Del. Kaye Kory, D-Fairfax, recently lamented that female prisoners will suffer from the General Assembly’s refusal this year to make Virginia the 38th state to pass a federal Equal Rights Amendment for women. The number of women behind bars in Virginia is skyrocketing and the criminal justice system can’t keep pace, she said during a March 15 radio interview on WAMU in Washington. The ERA would require Virginia and other states to adopt better standards for treating the incarcerated women, Kory said. ""Women in Virginia have been incarcerated at an increasingly high rate. It’s around (a) 300 percent increase in the past four or five years,"" Kory said. It’s been widely reported that the number of women inmates in the nation has risen at a much faster rate than the count of male inmates. But Kory’s eye-popping claim of ""around"" a 300 percent increase of women prisoners in Virginia caught our attention.  So, we fact-checked it. Numbers Virginia inmates are housed in state-run prisons and locally or regionally-run jails. Through three sources, we found statistics that let us compute yearly estimates of male and female inmates from December 2013 through June 2018. That’s a 4 ½-year span, right in the middle of ""the past four or five years"" Kory mentioned. We used data published by the the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and sent to us by the state Department of Corrections for prison populations. We also used statistics that were either published or sent to us by the state Compensation Board for jail populations. At the end of 2013, there were about 5,700 women inmates in jails and prisons, and that rose to around 6,700 in June 2018. That’s a 18 percent increase, and it shouldn’t be dismissed. The number of male prisoners during the same period dropped by 1.4 percent - from about 51,200 to 50,500. The differing trends of male and female incarceration have caught the attention of many prison reform advocates, including the Virginia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. But the increase in women inmates is a tiny fraction of the 300 percent surge Kory claimed. Kory’s Explanation Prior to our research, Kory told us she read about the 300 percent increase ""several years ago"" in a Richmond Times-Dispatch article. Max Jenkins, her administrative aide, quickly called back and said Kory had misspoken on radio. A few days later, he said, ""She meant to say there’s been a five-fold increase, nationally, in female incarceration since 2001."" But that, too, is wrong. And the Times-Dispatch did not report any of the statistics Kory used.  According to BJS data, 161,200 women were held in prisons and and jails in 2001, and  about 218,800 were incarcerated in mid 2016 - the latest information available. That’s a 36 percent increase, nowhere close to the 400 percent rise Kory’s aide claimed. It should be noted that during same span, the number of male inmates in state and federal prisons rose by 13 percent - again, a much slower pace than for women. Discussion  Kory’s enormous growth percentages would have held up if the she went further back in time. We found data on gender populations in state and federal prisons - but not jails - going back to 1978. There were 359 women in Virginia prisons that year, and the number rose to 3,114 last year. That’s a 767 percent.increase, roughly the same surge the country saw. Virginia’s male prison population went up by 328 percent during those years - less than half the growth rate of women - from 7,985 in 1978  to 34,172 last year. In other words, the female prison population has grown at more than twice rate of the male population over the last 40 years. Researchers largely attribute the rise in women inmates to drugs and poverty. According to BJS, the number of drugs arrests between 1980 and 2009 doubled for men, but tripled for women. Also, there are twice as many single mothers living below the poverty level than single fathers, according to the U.S. Census. In 2017, the bureau estimates 25.7 percent of households headed by single mothers were below the poverty line, compared to 12.4 percent of homes headed by single fathers. ""In general, those on the economic margins of society are far more likely to experience significant stress and problems with drugs,"" the ACLU of Virginia wrote in a 2018 study on the state’s incarceration of women. ""These types of stressors may account for higher involvement in larceny, theft, check and welfare fraud, and forgery among women living in poverty."" Our ruling Kory said, ""Women in Virginia have been incarcerated at an increasingly high rate. It’s around (a) 300 percent increase in the past four or five years."" She cited the surge as a big reason why Virginia needs to ratify the federal ERA amendment. The number of women inmates in Virginia and the nation has soared, but it’s occurred over five decades - not just the last few years. During the last 4 ½ years, there’s been an 18 percent increase, nowhere near Kory’s claim. Any credit we might give Kory for acknowledging she was wrong is blunted by her substitute explanation: That she meant to say that nationally, there’s been a fivefold increase in women prisoners since 2001. That, too, is way off. There’s been a 36 percent increase. Kory’s numbers are astronomically wrong, and we rate her statement False.",/factchecks/2019/apr/02/kaye-kory/del-kaye-kory-way-about-surge-women-prisoners-virg/

","President Donald Trump re-opened the health care debate with his decision to ask a federal court to scrap the entire Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional. After a year of unsuccessful efforts to repeal and replace the law also known as Obamacare, Republicans on Capitol Hill gave Trump’s move a cool reception. If he wins, it would do away with the law’s popular protection for people with pre-existing conditions. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said that should not be a concern. ""Every single plan that this White House has ever put forward since Donald Trump was elected covered pre-existing conditions,"" Mulvaney said on ABC News’ This Week March 31. ""Every single plan that Republicans in the House voted on in the previous Congress covered pre-existing conditions. Every single plan considered by the Senate covers preexisting conditions. ""The debate about pre-existing conditions is over. Both parties support them, and anyone telling you anything different is lying to you for political gain."" Mulvaney’s sweeping declaration about the Republican solutions is misleading. No Republican proposal matches the level of protection in Obamacare, and, at the very least, all open the door to significantly higher rates for people with health problems. We reached out to the White House for comment and did not hear back. In the old days, insurance companies had ways to avoid selling policies to people who were likely to cost more than insurers wanted to spend. They might deny them coverage outright, or exclude coverage for a known condition, or charge so much that insurance was unaffordable. The Affordable Care Act boxes out the old insurance practices with a package of legal moves. First, it says point-blank that carriers ""may not impose any preexisting condition exclusion."" It backs that up with another section that says they ""may not establish rules for eligibility"" based on health status, medical condition, claims experience or medical history. And while insurers can charge older people more, they can’t charge them more than three times what they charge younger policy holders. Wrapped around all that is a fourth measure that lists the essential health benefits that every plan must offer. A trip to the emergency room, surgery, maternity care and more all fall under this provision. This prevents insurers from discouraging people who might need expensive services by crafting plans that don’t offer them. The trade-off for insurers in the law was that everyone had to have insurance. The Republicans' most successful attack on the law was on that point: People who don't have insurance no longer face a fine.  All of the Republican bills had language that specifically forbid insurers from denying coverage based on someone’s health history. Yet all of them included wrinkles that could make policies much more expensive, or not offered at all, for people with health issues. The House’s American Health Care Act allowed rates for older people to vary as much as 5 to 1 compared with young people; meanwhile, the Affordable Care Act’s limit was 3 to 1. It also gave states the option to let insurance companies set rates based on health. ""People with pre-existing conditions would have been guaranteed insurance, but there was no guarantee the insurance would cover the benefits they need or be affordable,"" said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a source of neutral data on health policy. The Senate’s Better Care Reconciliation Act also expanded the allowable range of rates to 5 to 1. It included a 6-month waiting period for certain people who lost or dropped continuous coverage. The Senate’s Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson amendment offered states a block grant program. Under it, states gained the flexibility to allow insurers to set premiums based on health conditions, and states had leeway in defining the essential health benefits that every plan must cover. Shortly before the 2018 midterm elections, a group of 10 Republican senators introduced a bill called Ensuring Coverage for Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions. Despite its name, the bill included an option for companies to deny certain coverage if ""it will not have the capacity to deliver services adequately."" ""Mulvaney means the issue was addressed, nothing more than that,"" said Joe Antos, a health care analyst at the market-oriented American Enterprise Institute, ""At least one Republican bill talked about allowing states to adopt less stringent insurance rules, but requiring that they devote funds to help those with pre-existing conditions. That is less certain than the Affordable Care Act rules, which are unequivocal."" A long-standing critic of Obamacare, health care consultant Bob Laszewski, pointed to the same loophole. Asked if the Republican plans fell short of the current law’s protections, he offered a one-word response: ""Agreed."" ""The Affordable Care Act sets a fairly high bar,"" said former Republican Senate health care policy staffer Rodney Whitlock. ""And because of that, it’s very challenging for Mulvaney to make the case that pre-existing conditions are covered, under what most people would consider a common definition of coverage."" Whitlock and health law professor Wendy Netter Epstein at DePaul University noted the importance of affordability, a key guardrail in Obamacare. ""I might be offered a health insurance plan, but with rates so high that the offer is meaningless,"" Epstein said. ""Or I might be given a plan that ‘covers’ me but doesn’t reimburse for essential services that I need. What the Affordable Care Act does is provide assurances that all people, even those with pre-existing conditions, receive meaningful coverage."" Antos takes exception to the sweep of that statement. He noted that millions of people in the individual market have not found Affordable Care Act policies affordable. ""The law leaves out lower-middle-class people who aren’t eligible for ACA subsidies, can’t afford the ACA premium — or the combination of unsubsidized premium and high cost-sharing means buying an ACA plan doesn’t make sense — and don’t have employer coverage,"" Antos said. ""The fact that there is no medical underwriting under the ACA doesn’t mean everyone is guaranteed coverage that they can actually afford."" Still, another health law researcher, David Gamage at Indiana University, said Mulvaney’s words ""stretched the meaning of coverage."" ""Covering pre-existing conditions should be understood as requiring that there would exist real-world options for insurance that would be available and affordable for those with pre-existing conditions,"" Gamage said. ""Most of the Republican plans put forward by the White house or voted on in Congress would have clearly failed this test."" Mulvaney said that every single Republican health care plan ""covered pre-existing conditions."" It is accurate to say that all of them addressed the matter, but in one way or another, all of them failed to match the guarantees currently in the Affordable Care Act. A wide range of policy analysts agreed that under each proposal, some people with ongoing health problems potentially faced much higher rates or coverage of fewer benefits than today. For people concerned about pre-existing conditions, the current coverage is stronger than anything Republicans have proposed.

Does teacher pay fall short of the living wage in 30 states, as Kamala Harris said?
","Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has attracted attention with a proposal to boost average teacher pay by $13,500 if she’s elected president. To promote that policy, Harris sent a tweet that said, ""In 30 states, average teacher pay is less than the living wage for a family of four. The teacher pay gap is a national crisis. Sign your name next to mine if you agree."" In 30 states, average teacher pay is less than the living wage for a family of four. The teacher pay gap is a national crisis. Sign your name next to mine if you agree: https://t.co/qiTuiwf9ri Is it really true that ""in 30 states, average teacher pay is less than the living wage for a family of four""? Studies have argued that teacher pay has been stagnating in recent years, but it’s worth noting the particular framing Harris used. The Harris campaign pointed us to a study published in 2018 by Education Resource Strategies (ERS), an education consulting group, that compared average teacher salaries to a living wage, concluding that in more than half of states, average teacher salaries are below a family living wage for that state. A ""living wage"" refers to a calculation pioneered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that determines, based on geographic location, how much income is needed to meet a basic level of existence. It includes costs like food, housing, child care and health care. (Some federal poverty measures do not include all of these criteria.) The summary can be seen in this chart from the report.  Case closed? Before deciding, let’s take a closer look at what’s included in salary data that ERS used. First, the analysis doesn’t include benefits, which for unionized teachers can be more favorable than benefit packages in other types of jobs. Second, the data addresses pay earned during nine- or 10-month contracts that are typical for school systems; it does not include additional income the teacher may be able to earn during the summer. Yet this nine- or 10-month income is being compared to a living wage calculation based on a 12-month year. If a teacher works during the summer, their salary total would be higher, possibly rising above the living wage. The amount would vary by state. ""In Georgia, the average teacher would need to make only $735 over the summer, but in Colorado it would be over $12,000,"" said ERS spokeswoman Karen Silverman. And third, ERS’ data does not account for a spouse’s income, nor does it  incorporate an analysis of teachers who are single and have no children. Both these factors could determine the amount of a teacher’s applicable living-wage standard. How much should these caveats matter in evaluating Harris’ tweet? Jesse Rothstein, director of the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California-Berkeley, said concerns that the data doesn’t account for these circumstances are legitimate but amount to nitpicking. On the question of summer income, for instance, ""there is a long debate on this question,"" he said. ""Teachers in practice do quite a bit of work over the summer to prepare for school and in part because teachers are rarely able to find highly-paid summer jobs."" Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University, said it’s important not to ignore the gender context when discussing a field that is overwhelmingly female. ""It's an unfair gender bias that potential income from spouses comes up immediately in discussions of teacher pay when it might not come up in discussions of the pay of other occupations — imagine police officers or firefighters for example,"" Sinclair said. ""This comparison is about what teachers are paid, not what households with teachers in them earn."" Sinclair also said that considering the size of families can also be problematic. ""It seems like a slippery slope when talking about pay since it's illegal to ask about marital status or children in hiring, so that seems inappropriate to consider for pay as well,"" she said. Sinclair said she would prefer to see public officials compare teachers’ salaries to the average salaries of the college-educated. Still, she said, there is value in what Harris said, because it supports the idea that ""teaching is a profession that should be valued more in society than it currently is."" Harris said, ""In 30 states, average teacher pay is less than the living wage for a family of four."" Since a living wage is in part calculated based on a person’s household and family circumstances, the comparison Harris used excludes such factors as non-salary benefits, summer income, working spouses, and smaller family sizes. Harris's premise is that teacher pay alone should support a family of four. In the context she specifies, her statement is accurate.  We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/apr/01/kamala-harris/does-teacher-pay-fall-short-living-wage-30-states-/

Proposition advocate says Central Health district has lowest tax rate among largest Texas hospital districts and that will still be so if voters approve tax increase
","
Central Health, the government agency entrusted with improving health care access across Travis County, has a low tax rate that will remain low if voters ratify Proposition 1 on the November 2012 ballot, a proponent says.

Mark Nathan of the Keep Austin Healthy PAC said recently: ""Our health care district’s tax rate is the lowest among the largest counties in Texas, and it will continue to be the lowest"" if the proposal wins approval. His comment appeared in an Austin American-Statesman news article posted online the same day, Oct. 18, 2012.

Central Health, the county health-care district created in 2004, seeks to increase its tax rate from 7.89 cents per $100 of assessed value to 12.9 cents for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 2013. Resulting revenue would help support health-care initiatives including a new medical school plus a site for a new teaching hospital.

We wondered about the district’s current and possible future tax rates.

In 2005, the first year the district collected property taxes, Central Health’s governing  board set a tax rate of 7.79 cents per $100 of assessed property value, which cost the average taxpayer $126.84, according to a July 31, 2012, Statesman news story. Between 2005 and 2011, the average tax bill for Central Health rose $29.77 to the current $156.61 on the average-valued home in Travis County, counting exemptions--an increase of 23.5 percent, the story says.

Generally, according to the story, Central Health’s finances were helped over the years by unexpected windfalls in federal payments, a robust real estate market that pumped up property tax collections and a deal the City of Austin cut with the Seton Healthcare Family years before voters created the district, allowing the district to steadily expand services while setting relatively modest tax rates.

By phone, district spokeswoman Christie Garbe told us the district’s low tax rate is an artifact of how the district was born, reflecting the merger of separate rates previously levied for health care by the City of Austin and Travis County. Garbe said by email that after the change, residents outside the city experienced a significant rate increase while city residents saw a slight decrease.

Another fiscally relevant distinction: Unlike hospital districts in Harris, Dallas, Bexar, Tarrant and El Paso counties, the July Statesman story says, Central Health does not run a hospital, so it can function with a lower tax rate. The Seton Healthcare Family operates the safety-net University Medical Center Brackenridge and bears most of the financial responsibility for it, the story says, which has helped Central Health set property tax rates 60 to 74 percent lower than other urban Texas hospital districts.

At our inquiry, Nathan emailed us a chart, attributed to Central Health, indicating that its tax rate trails those of hospital districts in the urban counties noted in the July Statesman article plus Nueces County. All things staying equal, the other districts’ rates would also outpace the Central Health rate if Proposition 1 passes, according to the chart. Garbe told us by email that the chart reflects April 2012 research by Central Health.

According to the chart, the Nueces County district has the next-lowest rate, 16.24 cents per $100 valuation. That's more than double Central Health’s rate.

Via telephone interviews and web research, we confirmed the proclaimed rates, but found one rate getting cut. Mike Norby of the Harris County Hospital District, also known as the Harris Health System, said by phone that the county’s commissioners court voted to reduce the district’s tax rate by a penny to 18.22 cents per $100 valuation, effectively cutting the district’s revenue by $10 million once all factors are considered. (He said the vote to do so occurred Oct. 23, 2012, which was after Nathan made his claim.)

So, Central Health has the lowest rate among seven urban Texas hospital districts and would still have the lowest rate if the proposition passes, presuming other districts do not slash rates in the meantime.

At the recommendation of Jonny Hipp, ceo of the Nueces County district, we queried Austin consultant Shari Holland, who told us she has written reports in the past comparing Texas hospital districts; report purchasers have included Central Health, she said.

Holland agreed that Central Health has and will likely have a lower tax rate than the other cited districts, due in part, she said, to the Austin area’s high property values. In 2008, she said, Travis County had assessed property values of $97,100 per resident, tops among the 10 most populous counties.

Curious about the possible effect of higher property values, we asked Nathan how much tax revenue each of the cited health districts raises per resident.

Central Health has ranked last among the seven districts in total tax revenues per resident, at $71, according to another Central Health chart emailed to us by Nathan. However, its per-resident revenue would escalate to $115 if the proposition passes. The district could then be collecting more per resident than the districts in Nueces and El Paso counties, which  have per-person tax revenues of $91 and $86, respectively, according to Central Health. The other analyzed health districts still would generate more tax revenue per resident, the district’s research suggests.

By email, Nathan pointed out he did not say Central Health’s per-resident tax collections would stay the lowest.

Our ruling

Nathan, the PAC spokesman, said Central Health has the lowest tax rate among districts in the largest Texas counties and will retain that distinction if the proposition passes. That’s correct, presuming other districts don’t slash rates.

Still, Central Health’s per-person tax levy is projected to outpace those of two other districts should Travis County voters approve the bump. This information was missing from the spokesman's statement. Tax rates alone make the comparison incomplete.

Baldwin says Thompson got $3 million from mismanaged federal contract that left 9/11 responders without promised care
","
In response to a 9/11 ad against her, Democrat Tammy Baldwin has launched one charging that U.S. Senate rival Tommy Thompson personally profited from a mismanaged federal contract that left Ground Zero first responders without promised care.

The Baldwin ad opens by calling Thompson’s ad a ""disgrace.""

""The truth: time and again Tammy Baldwin has supported honoring victims of 9/11,"" a narrator says. ""And Tommy Thompson? He got a government contract to provide healthcare to 9/11 first responders, but Tommy took advantage, leaving them without the care they were promised.""

It concludes: ""Tommy Thompson personally made over $3 million off the deal.""

Newspaper headlines from the New York Daily News (""Ex-health boss now cashing in on 9/11"") and USA Today (""Health company slow to start treating workers"") flash on the screen, along with a footnote that points to Thompson’s personal financial disclosures.

Do Baldwin’s charges square with what happened?

The basics

Thompson was President George Bush’s secretary of Health and Human Services at the time of the 9/11 attacks in 2001. As such, he was a point of contact for New York-based members of Congress and 9/11 advocates who began a years-long push to get federal aid for health monitoring and treatment of those who responded first to the attacks.

Thompson left the Bush Administration after the first term. By early 2005, he had signed on as a law partner at the Washington, D.C., lobbying firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, and separately was named president of Logistics Health Inc.

The La Crosse-based firm, founded in 1999, provides medical readiness and occupational health services, in part through federal government contracts.

One of those was the 2008 contract for 9/11 responder care, which was awarded competitively through a division of the federal agency Thompson used to head. The contract was for $11 million for the first year.

Logistics Health continues to run the national portion of what is known as the World Trade Center Health Program.

The program helps pay for medical treatment and monitoring of certain conditions experienced by people who worked or volunteered on rescue, recovery, demolition, debris removal, and related services in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center. Another contractor coordinates care for New York-area responders and survivors.

Baldwin’s claim

Let’s return to the main components of the ad’s claim:

""He got a government contract to provide healthcare to 9/11 first responders.""

The ad’s use of the headline -- ""Ex-health boss now cashing in on 9/11"" -- insinuates a lot.

But neither Baldwin nor anyone else we know of has presented evidence Thompson personally scored the contract or influenced his former agency to get it for Logistics Health.

On the other hand, the company did get the contract. And Thompson’s value at the firm was tied in part to his connections. That’s what Logistics CEO Don Weber noted in 2006:

""If I were to go in and try to get a meeting with some of the decision makers in these organizations, it would take me a lifetime,"" Weber told the Journal Sentinel at the time. ""Tommy is able to make a phone call -- and then we get in front of people who make decisions. And when we can show them what we're all about, it expedites decisions.""

So that part of the claim is at least partially accurate.

""But Tommy took advantage, leaving them without the care they were promised.""

We read various media accounts regarding the early months of Logistics Health’s work on the 9/11 contract starting. It took over the work in June 2008 from an association of health clinics.

No one disputes that gaps in medical coverage and monitoring took place in those early months. At least two media outlets interviewed clients who reported problems getting coverage for prescription drugs and experiencing delays in hearing from Logistics.

""A company run by an ex-Bush administration official and hired by the government to provide medical care to Sept. 11 recovery workers has been slow to take up the job, workers and advocates say,"" the Associated Press reported on Sept. 8, 2008.

A November 16, 2008, Wisconsin State Journal story reported that five months into Logistics Health's one-year federal contract, just a fraction of eligible patients had received the required medical monitoring. The situation had attracted a sharp backlash from New York-area members of Congress who complained about Thompson’s ""sweetheart deal"" with his old department.

Thompson and Weber did not deny the delays, a State Journal follow-up story said.

They blamed the problems on the agency that awarded the contract, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. A NIOSH spokesman in 2008 offered a partial explanation: A one-month delay occurred after the agency inquired to Logistics Health about an issue on consent forms.

The first State Journal story quoted Katherine Kirkland, head of the organization that was turning over the 9/11 work to Thompson’s firm, saying that Logistics officials were uncommunicative or dismissive of issues that came up during the transition. Kirkland also said the federal government didn’t allow enough time for the transition.

It’s important to note here that even at the time of the November 2008 story, federal officials were saying the start-up problems had been brought under control and all patients were getting needed treatment.

There was skepticism about that at the time from 9/11 victim advocacy groups, but it turned out to be true, or largely true, based on what we hear now from those groups.

One example: John Feal, president of the FealGood Foundation, which pushed for federal help for first responders, told us Logistics ""wasn’t ready for"" the job but ""for the most part kept their word"" after late 2008 to fix the problems.

Feal, who is no fan of Thompson, gives ""above thumbs up approval"" for Logistics’ work since then.

NIOSH spokeswoman Christina Spring told us officials there consider  Logistics’ performance very good since the delays of the early months.

We went back and interviewed Judy Wolff, a nurse's aide from Holmen, Wisconsin, who has suffered from multiple health problems since volunteering at Ground Zero. Her concerns with delays in getting coverage were featured in the November 2008 State Journal piece.

Back then, while waiting for Logistics to act, she was forced over several months to pay for her own drugs for various ailments deemed related to her work at the site. Today, she says her care improved a lot after the negative publicity for the company, but that paperwork hassles still trouble her.

As for the ""took advantage"" part, it is unclear exactly what that means -- took advantage of the patients? The situation? the government?

Judging by the sentence structure, the claim is that Thompson mismanaged the situation intentionally to make the firm some extra bucks.

We asked Baldwin if she could explain and defend the ""took advantage"" allegation, and she only cited the complaints about delays in care.

This part of the claim exaggerates the severity of a serious situation, leaving out the critical fact that the transition problems were mostly ironed out within six months or less, and that the government itself got some of the blame.

""Tommy Thompson personally made over $3 million off the deal.""

Thompson did make that amount from the sale of Logistics Health in 2011. Thompson, who no longer works for the firm, said the money came from stock options. He also reported making $254,000 in salary from the firm between January 2010 and October 2011.

But the ad treats that $3.1 million sum as springing directly from the 9/11 contract and entering Thompson’s pocket. Baldwin did not offer any explanation for this part of the claim when we asked her about it.

The contract in question started at $11 million a year and at one point fell to $9 million. That’s real money, but a pretty small chunk of Logistics’ business: in 2008 it received $102 million just in federal contracts, according to data at fedspending.org.

So this part of Baldwin’s ad is a big reach.

Logistics Health did not return a phone call on the Baldwin ad.

Our rating

Baldwin says Thompson ""personally made over $3 million"" off a federal contract granted to his healthcare company, but left  9/11 first responders ""without the care they were promised.""

The ad accurately says his firm got a contract and had problems that delayed care for some first responders.

But it ignores the mixed blame for the problems as well as the short-term nature of them, while making a sensational and unsubstantiated claim that Thompson personally pocketed millions from this particular contract. And it suggests Thompson ""took advantage"" of first responders without any evidence to back it up.

Looking at the claim as a whole, we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/oct/26/tammy-baldwin/baldwin-says-thompson-got-3-million-mismanaged-fed/

Thompson says Baldwin voted against resolution to honor victims of 9/11
","
Republican U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson uses military veterans, images of the fallen twin towers and pictures of 9/11 victims to criticize Democratic rival Tammy Baldwin in a new television ad.

The ad opens with a female Air Force veteran stating: ""Tammy Baldwin had the opportunity to vote to honor the victims of 9/11 and she voted against it."" Images of the battered towers and victims memorial pass by.

Two other veterans chime in with statements including:

""It’s a slap in the face to every one of their families and anyone who has ever served in the United States military. Tammy Baldwin’s extreme far left approach leaves this country in jeopardy.""

And this: ""It’s a very dangerous path Tammy’s leading us on.""

The ad concludes with a veteran stating: ""What would you do if these were your children? How would you feel?""

Let’s look at the core claim in this ad: That Baldwin, a U.S. House member from Madison, voted against a tribute to Sept. 11 victims.

The claim stems from a Sept. 14, 2006, vote on a resolution commemorating the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. Baldwin was one of 22 House members -- 21 Democrats and one Republican -- to vote against the resolution.

Thompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe said the matter was pretty cut and dried.

""It is simple, she was one of 22 members that voted against it, an incredibly small margin.  This was a near unanimous vote.""

So there is some truth in Thompson claim.

But that’s far from the entire story.

At the time, Baldwin delivered a speech on the House floor denouncing Republicans for adding language to the routine commemoration that she did not agree with.

According to the Congressional Record, here’s what she said Sept. 13, 2006:

""Mr. Speaker, on the fifth anniversary of the worst attack on American soil, my Republican colleagues have disgracefully politicized what should have been a solemn and sincere resolution.

""This week we are mourning the tragic losses of innocent lives as well as commemorating the unsurpassed heroism that was on display that day.

""We are expressing our gratitude to our nation’s law enforcement officers for their tireless dedication to make our country safer; and we are reaffirming our nation’s resolve to combat terrorism and secure our homeland. But rather than offering a bipartisan resolution that unites us on this solemn occasion, the Republican leadership converted the bill into an endorsement of the Patriot Act, punitive immigration bills, and other highly controversial measures, which many of my constituents oppose.

""This bill was cynically transformed from a memorial resolution to an endorsement of President Bush’s failed policies. The Republicans show enormous disrespect to the 9/11 victims and families by playing election year politics with something as solemn as the fifth anniversary of 9/11; I will vote against the bill.""

The publication CQ Weekly, which covers Congress, described the resolution this way in a Sept. 18, 2006 piece:

""But this year’s version was different. Taken up 54 days before one of the most pivotal elections in a decade, the measure afforded Republicans and Democrats a platform from which to argue about which party is more determined to prevail in the war on terror.""

The story added: ""Republicans stuffed the bill with references to GOP-crafted measures that they say improve national security. Democrats, who voted for some of the bills listed in the resolution, wanted no references to new laws, and complained that framing the resolution that way made it too much of a political document.""

Thompson’s ad shows a portion of a Sept. 14, 2006, headline from Baldwin’s hometown Capital Times --  ""Baldwin rejects 9-11 tribute"" -- but not the entire headline, which read: ""Baldwin rejects 9/11 tribute, saying it insults victims, families.""

The Baldwin campaign notes that she has voted in favor of a similar resolution honoring 9/11 victims nine times -- in 2001, ‘02, ‘04, ‘05, ‘07, ‘08, ‘09 ‘10 and ‘11.

The campaign also points out that one day before the 2006 vote, Baldwin voted in favor of a resolution calling for ""establishing a national memorial at the World Trade Center site to commemorate and mourn the events of February 26, 1993, and September 11, 2001.""

Our rating

Thompson said his Democratic challenger voted against a resolution honoring 9/11 victims. Technically he’s correct. Baldwin voted against the measure in 2006 -- and criticized Republicans for adding in references to the Patriot Act, immigration bills, and other controversial matters.

But Baldwin has voted nine times in favor of similar resolutions and the day before the vote in question supported creation of a memorial at the World Trade Center site.

Thompson’s statement contains an element of truth, but leaves out critical information that would give a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False. 
(Editor's note: On Oct. 31, 2012, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel columnist Daniel Bice reported Baldwin had actually missed one of the nine votes her campaign cited -- a fact the campaign acknowledged, saying she was sick that day.  )",/factchecks/2012/oct/26/tommy-thompson/thompson-says-baldwin-voted-against-resolution-hon/
"['Georgia', 'Johnny Isakson']","
Need a job? Obama's hiring, Georgia senator says.
","
There’s been much said about the dearth of ""Help Wanted"" signs across America, but one lawmaker from Georgia recently talked about a place where there’s been an increase in the workforce in recent years.

""One industry in America has increased its employment base in the last four years by 176,000 people: the United States government,"" U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Marietta Republican, told a group of community leaders at an Oct. 11 luncheon in Cobb County.

Isakson’s larger point was that the federal government is not making the hard choices to spend wisely, as American families are doing, according to an article in The Marietta Daily Journal.

Since the Great Recession, we’ve heard much about state and local governments laying off employees to cope with the decline in tax revenue. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the senator was correct about an actual increase in the number of employees on Uncle Sam’s payroll.

USA Today reported earlier this year that federal employment grew 13 percent — 250,000 jobs — from the recession's start in December 2007 to a peak in September. During that time, private employment fell 5 percent and state and local governments cut staffs by 2 percent.

Under President Barack Obama, the federal government has attempted to ease hiring processes and been more aggressive in hiring Latinos, The Washington Post recently reported. Obama's budget calls for a small increase in federal workers, although the president has frozen employee salaries for more than two years.

Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has criticized Obama for the increase in the size of the federal workforce under his administration. Romney has proposed cutting the federal workforce by 10 percent. For every two employees who retire, Romney’s goal would be to hire one new federal worker, according to the Post.

The federal Office of Personnel Management has data on its website with an annual total of federal employees dating to 1962. It includes Postal Service employees. The number of federal employees rose the greatest, by 22 percent, when Democrat Lyndon Johnson was in the White House during the mid- to late 1960s. The number of federal employees was at its highest in 1990, when Republican George H.W. Bush was president.

Federal employees represent slightly more than 1 percent of the nation’s total workforce, a statistic that has changed little in recent years, according to government data.

Isakson spokeswoman Lauren Culbertson said the senator came up with the figure after reviewing data from the Office of Personnel Management’s website. The most recent month available was June 2012, which showed the federal government had 2,115,707 workers. Isakson’s office compared it with September 2008. The federal government had 1,938,821 workers that month, according to that website. The difference is 176,886. The website does not have figures for June 2008.

The data include people who work for Cabinet-level agencies, larger agencies such as NASA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Social Security Administration and more obscure ones such as the Railroad Retirement Board and the Marine Mammal Commission. It does not include enlisted members of the U.S. military.

If you were wondering, the Office of Personnel Management said it does not include people hired to conduct the U.S. Census in its count of the federal workforce. The Census Bureau needed to fill 1.2 million part-time positions for the work. It does include statisticians who were temporarily hired to help with the census.

The Partnership for Public Service, a Washington-based, nonpartisan organization that works on ways to help federal workers improve their jobs and ideas when they fall short. The organization also uses the Office of Personnel Management numbers to measure the size of the federal workforce. Staffers there noted that the numbers Isakson used to make his comparison included seasonal and part-time workers.

PolitiFact Georgia found a breakdown of full-time federal workers in September 2008 and June 2012. The increase was 178,857, which is slightly more than what Isakson cited in his speech in Cobb County. The biggest increases during this time period were in the Defense, Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security departments.

To sum up, Isakson said the federal workforce has increased by about 176,000 between September 2008 and June 2012. His claim is accurate if you examine full-time workers and include those working for Uncle Sam on a part-time or seasonal basis.

Mitt Romney camp says 6,400 Ohioans lost manufacturing jobs in September
","
The national unemployment rate has ticked down slowly -- much too slowly, says Mitt Romney’s campaign -- and Ohio’s economy has generally grown. Its unemployment rate is even 0.8 percent below the national average.

But the unsteadiness of the recovery, even in Ohio, underlined a recent claim by the campaign for Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate. On Oct. 22, the spokesman, Robert Reid, said in an email to reporters:

""Vice President Biden may believe there is a ‘renaissance’ in manufacturing happening in the Buckeye state, but don’t tell that to the 6,400 Ohioans who lost manufacturing jobs in the month of September.""

Could this job loss be true?

After all, didn’t the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services announce just a few days earlier that the state’s unemployment rate had gone down yet again, reaching 7.0?

The answer to both questions is yes.

According to the monthly survey of businesses that state and federal officials use to assess job gains or losses, Ohio’s lost 12,800 non-farm jobs in September. Jobs in manufacturing accounted for 6,400 of those job, or half the loss.

This was a preliminary figure and it could be adjusted upward or downward in the coming months as more surveys are turned in. The survey, called Current Employment Statistics, is conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in conjunction with ODJFS.

Sure, that seems inconsistent with the reported drop in Ohio’s unemployment, from 7.2 percent to 7.0 percent. But as many Americans have learned this year, the two numbers do not always move in the same direction.

Here’s why: The unemployment rate is based on a a different and broader survey. It is not a survey of businesses. Rather, it is a civilian survey, called the Current Population Survey, and it asks people whether they are in the workforce or looking for a job. Each time someone stops looking for work -- whether it’s because he or she has retired, has given up on looking, has become self-employed or has some other reason -- that is one fewer person counted as unemployed.

The unemployment rate has other factors, including the number of people who come of age and start looking for jobs. That’s why the opposite trend of what occurred in September sometimes happens: The country can gain jobs yet the unemployment rate might still rise. Economists say that a healthy economy must add enough jobs to at least keep up with adult population growth.

As for the Romney spokesman’s comment, an article in The Plain Dealer by business reporter Olivera Perkins made a similar point, sans politics. It said, ""Ohio’s unemployment rate down to 7 percent, though state lost jobs.""

Speaking to the conflicting direction of the trends -- that is, employers who reported they had fewer jobs, yet people in the workforce who nevertheless said they were, in fact, employed -- Hiram College economics professor Ugur Aker told the newspaper that gains in self-employment could explain the difference.

""What is happening is that there are wage and salary jobs being eliminated,"" Aker told The Plain Dealer. ""On the other hand, it looks like jobs are increasing because there are more people working for themselves. Is that a good thing? Bad thing? I don't know.""

Economic research analyst George Zeller, noting that manufacturing ""has been driving this recovery,"" told the newspaper that the losses ""are very bad news.""

The numbers cited by the Romney campaign were confirmed by ODJFS and the BLS. They were reported by other media, too.

Romney’s spokesman made the statement in an attempt to lay political blame. Voters in Ohio will have their say on that soon enough. PolitiFact Ohio is only ruling on the accuracy of the claim about job losses in manufacturing.

The statement is accurate, but some additional information is needed to provide clarification.

Reid, the Romney spokesman, was citing losses from one month -- losses that totaled just shy of 1 percent. To get a better sense of changes in manufacturing employment during President Barack Obama’s term to date, consider these monthly figures provided by ODJFS and BLS. Here is what the numbers and a calculator show: 
What’s this tell you?

That many but not all of those factory jobs lost during Obama’s term have come back. In that single sentence you have both parties’ economic messages.

Curious to see another trend, we looked back further. Not to be the bearer of bad news, but you probably know this anyway: Ohio was losing manufacturing jobs for a long time. The number fell during both of George W. Bush’s terms, with Ohio losing a third of its manufacturing jobs by the end of the eight years. During Bill Clinton’s first term, the number of those jobs rose by 4.2 percent, but declined by 2.7 percent in his second term.

So was the Romney campaign cherry picking its figure, given these broader trends?

You might argue that, but as The Plain Dealer reported, the latest monthly jobs report troubled economists, too. It was just one monthly report and more information will be required to know if there is a trend, but it suggested a weaker recovery. And, combined with the latest unemployment number, it raised questions about the trade-offs of self-employment, perhaps at lower wages.

Would Knute Buehler shelve Oregon's vote-by-mail?
","
As is the trend in other states, Republicans in Oregon tend to argue for tighter security against potential voter fraud, while Democrats defend the system we have now.

That message is nearly impossible to miss in the race for Oregon secretary of state. According to incumbent Kate Brown and other prominent Democrats, a vote for Republican candidate Knute Buehler is a vote for right-wing Republicans and a vote to kill our vote-by-mail system.

This week, former Democratic Secretary of State Bill Bradbury, who was in office when Oregon became the first state to conduct a presidential election entirely by mail, chimed in with his thoughts on Buehler in a fundraising pitch:

Republican Secretary of State candidate Knute Buehler is right on message with the Republican talking points trying to scare voters (out of) vote-by-mail. If Buehler were elected, our vote-by-mail system would be at risk.""

Sal Peralta, secretary of the Independent Party of Oregon, asked PolitiFact Oregon to check it out. Buehler also is the Independent Party’s nominee for this office. (The other candidates in the race, by the way, are Pacific Green Seth Woolley, Libertarian Bruce Alexander Knight and Progressive Robert Wolfe.)

Voters approved the citizen ballot measure switching to mail-in voting by a 2-to-1 ratio in 1998, so we know it was well received. Is it true that Buehler has a beef against the system?

As evidence of Buehler’s alleged hostility toward vote-by-mail, Democrats have cited language from a column written by Oregonian columnist Steve Duinabout Republican attempts in other states to introduce new ID requirements for voters. Brown is quoted as opposed to the ""war on voting.""

The part involving Buehler, we offer in its entirety, because readers need the context.
  
Knute Buehler, the Bend Republican opposing Brown in November, said he has no interest in ending vote-by-mail. The system is a popular element of the state's independent streak, he said, and he isn't hearing -- or pushing -- a move to return Oregonians to the polls. 
But Buehler does say, ""There is some concern about the integrity of the process, where it takes more ID to rent a movie at Blockbuster than it does to vote. There are thousands of ballots floating around in various locations during the process. There are concerns about undue pressure to vote, because you don't have the privacy of a polling booth. 
""And I'm not sure we've done a thorough evaluation to see how we're dealing with these integrity issues."" 
.
See that part where Duin writes that Buehler said he has no interest in ending vote-by-mail? Democrats probably saw that too, but for some reason, chose instead to focus on the language about Blockbuster and ballots floating around and the privacy of a polling booth.

Buehler, in an interview with PolitiFact Oregon, said he still thinks it takes more ID to rent a movie than to register to vote in Oregon. He supports the idea of an audit of the system. And Buehler repeated to us -- as he clearly stated to Duin -- that he does not want to end Oregon’s vote-by-mail system.

""I love vote-by-mail,"" he said. ""My point is that I just want to make it the best that it can be. Why are people so concerned about studying something?""

We also talked to Bradbury.

""My understanding is that he has stated that the vote-by-mail system has had many problems with fraud,"" Bradbury said. ""If you’re convinced that vote-by-mail is a fraud-filled system, it’s very unlikely that you’re going to support strengthening vote-by-mail.""

We told Bradbury that Buehler didn’t say that the system was filled with fraud -- just that there were questions that he wanted to address.

Bradbury’s response? ""I don’t feel very comfortable with someone being in charge of vote-by-mail if their biggest concern seems to be that there is a fraud-riddled system, or they’re listening to friends who think it is.""

We also offered Brown’s campaign spokeswoman a chance to comment.

""Knute questions the very nature of vote-by-mail by saying that there is 'undue pressure to vote because you don't have the privacy of a polling booth.' Knute’s statement fundamentally argues against vote-by-mail’s existence,"" said Jillian Schoene in an email.

Briefly, let’s get back to the remark about Blockbuster. Buehler is interested in beefing up identification requirements to register to vote in Oregon, and that position definitely puts him to the right of Brown on the issue. But changing the requirements of registering to vote doesn’t mean the way we vote in Oregon would be at risk by electing Buehler.

Democrats are hammering Buehler for raising questions. Raising questions about vote-by-mail -- even talking about the possibility that some people may feel pressured outside a polling booth -- is not the same as wanting to end vote-by-mail. Does Brown want to get rid of state agencies just because her Audits Division raises questions about them? We think not. That’s her job.

PolitiFact Oregon doesn’t do predictions. Obviously, we don’t know what Buehler would do if elected. More important, Democrats don’t know either. When we look at the evidence they’ve provided for his alleged antipathy toward the system, we just aren’t convinced.

In fact, the evidence indicates that he likes vote by mail just fine. We don’t know how many more times -- or in how many more ways -- he can say that he supports mail balloting. The statement is inflammatory and ridiculous. We rule it Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2012/oct/26/bill-bradbury/would-knute-buehler-shelve-oregons-vote-mail/

Barack Obama says banks paid back all the federal bailout money
","On the campaign trail, President Barack Obama has spoken much more of the bailouts for auto companies than their bank brethren. But, far from Detroit, the president raised the issue of the bank bailouts last week in New Hampshire.

Speaking before a crowd of about 6,000 voters in Manchester, N.H., Obama assured supporters that of all the fiscal issues facing the nation, the bank bailouts are no longer among them.

""We got back every dime used to rescue the banks,"" he told the crowd gathered Oct. 18 in Victory Park. ""We made that happen.""

As of this month, four years have passed since federal lawmakers salvaged some of the nations largest banks with the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. But, now, the question is, how much of the money has the government received back?

We decided to crunch the numbers.

In past rulings, PolitiFact has looked into statements about the auto industry bailout, and last month, we ruled Mostly False on a claim from former President Bill Clinton’s that the total bailout program has earned a profit. But, Obama’s claim about the bank bailouts, specifically, seemed to be worth a fresh look.

To start, we reached out to the Obama campaign, which directed us first to the U.S. Treasury, which releases daily updates on the Temporary Assets Relief Program.

The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which created the TARP, initially offered up to $700 billion to banks, auto companies, insurance agencies and mortgage lenders, among other groups. In 2010, Congress amended the law to limit the spending to $475 billion.

Now, four years later, lawmakers have thus far distributed $466 billion of that total, according to the Treasury, and, of that total, about $370.4 billion has been returned, including $41.9 billion from interest and dividends, among other income sources.

But, of those the totals, the bank payments that the president referenced are only a portion. Of the $466 billion distributed, about $245.2 billion have gone to banks, both national and local. And, as of Oct. 18, the day of the president’s speech, the government had taken back about $266.7 billion, according to the treasury count-- about $21.5 billion more than the initial investment.

""TARP’s bank programs have already earned a significant profit for taxpayers,"" Matthew Anderson, a Treasury Department spokesman, wrote in an email to PolitiFact NH.

But, that total doesn’t necessarily mean the banks have paid back in full. The treasury report shows that, of the $245.2 billion disbursements, $232.9 been have been repaid. The $33.8 billion difference between the repayments and the total cash collected has come through interest, dividends and other revenue sources.

These numbers differ slightly from those reported by ProPublica, a Pulitzer-winning investigative group, which tracks the federal figures on its Bailout Tracker.

ProPublica, which categorizes the payments differently, reports that banks have returned $223.9 billion, which, along with $31.9 billion collected in interest other revenues, has left the government with a $19.6 billion gain.

But, the point is the same, noted Paul Kiel, who authors the Bailout Tracker.

""Essentially, the treasury has realized a profit on the bank portion of the TARP investments,"" Kiel wrote last week in an email message.

Those profits could rise even higher. The treasury, which purchased stock from 707 banks, still holds investments in about 280 of them. But, if we expand the definition, as ProPublica does, to include investment agencies and credit card companies, among other financial institutions, more than 400 companies still have debts outstanding with the government, Kiel wrote in a September blog post.

Most of these banks, however, are small institutions who are struggling to stay afloat, Kiel wrote. Of the 400-plus, 162 have fallen behind on their dividend payments to the treasury, he wrote, and, according to a March report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, 130 banks were included on the government’s list of ""problem banks,"" demonstrating ""financial, operational, or managerial weaknesses that threatened their continued financial viability.""

""While repayments, dividends, and interest from institutions participating ... have exceeded the program’s original investment disbursements, the number of missed payments has increased over the life of the program,"" government officials wrote in the GAO report. ""Institutions that continue to miss payments and problem institutions may have difficulty ever fully repaying their … investments.""

Our ruling:

Not all of the banks who received TARP money have repaid the loans. In fact, 400-plus banks are still on the government’s red list -- more than have completed the payments -- and, according to the GAO, some may never pay the money back.

But, the fact remains, due to interest, dividends and other revenue streams, the government has received more money back ($266.7 billion, according to the Treasury) than it handed out to banks under the bailout law ($245.2 billion).

Ad claims GM used bailout money to boost China operations
","
If there is one economic success that President Barack Obama likes to tout, it is the recovery of the American auto industry. An ad now circulating on the Web aims to strip Obama of that accomplishment. It is called Chinese Motors and accuses General Motors, and by extension, Obama, of parlaying American taxpayer dollars to create jobs in China.

The ad comes from Let Freedom Ring USA, a group that fuses religious and fiscal conservatives. The group’s president Colin Hanna said he has spent $7 million dollars to have the ad show up 300 million times on computer screens in Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Here is what the ad says: 
Obama video: ""We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And tonight, the American auto industry is back."" 
Image: ""Almost two-thirds of GM’s jobs are in other countries - Forbes"" 
GM CEO video: ""Seven out of 10 of our vehicles were made outside the United States."" 
Text: ""OUTSIDE the United States?"" 
Announcer: ""That’s the CEO of General Motors, the man President Obama appointed."" 
Image: ""GM, which closed 13 plants in the U.S. ... opened 15 plants in China. - CNN"" 
Tom Rose - retired auto worker: ""Is this a GM America bailout or a GM China bailout?"" 
GM CEO: ""Our commitment to work in China, with China, for China, remains strong."" 
Announcer: ""President Obama. Your GM CEO is bragging about working for China? With our taxpayer dollars you gave him? Not working for us?"" 
Roy Smith - retired auto worker: ""Anytime our tax dollars are being used to prop up another country, it’s not the right thing for America."" 
Hanna has high hopes for what voters will take away from the ad. ""They will conclude that the GM bailout was a colossal misuse of their taxpayers’ dollars,"" Hanna said. ""Not the shining example of betting on the American worker that President Obama claims that it is.""

In this fact-check, we look at whether bailout money propped up GM’s operations in China.

Some key bankruptcy and bailout numbers

Thousands of American workers and lenders had a great deal riding on the restructuring of General Motors. When GM declared bankruptcy in 2009, it had $172 billion in debts and $82 billion in assets. Of its 50 largest creditors, 45 were suppliers like U.S. Steel and Goodyear Tires. Together, they were owed nearly $900 million. GM’s obligations to its workers totaled $23 billion. Bondholders were owed $27 billion.

Simply to stay afloat, GM borrowed over $9 billion from the government while President George W. Bush was in office. By the time it emerged from bankruptcy, the government had put about $51 billion into the effort to save GM. A bit over half of that has been repaid. 
GM in China and the U.S.

In China, GM has 11 joint ventures and two wholly owned foreign enterprises with more than 35,000 employees. In 2011, these firms produced 2.5 million vehicles and generated some $1.5 billion in profits for GM in the U.S.

With more and more Chinese interested in buying cars, GM plans to expand there. One of its joint ventures, Shanghai GM, recently won approval to build a $1 billion plant in the country’s central Hubei province. The plant is slated to produce 300,000 vehicles a year.

In the United States, GM has 12 assembly plants, many other smaller plants and more than 79,000 employees. In 2011, those plants produced more than 1.8 million vehicles. The company’s operating income across all its North American operations, which includes, Canada and Mexico, were $7.2 billion.

Since 2009, GM says it has invested about $7.3 billion in its American facilities.

Following the money

The ad claims that the bailout of GM propped up operations in China. To the extent that a collapse of GM in the United States would have caused considerable headaches in China, that claim is accurate. The end of GM would have required complex negotiations over the rights to use GM’s designs and technology and a number of other knotty issues. Avoiding that was very good news for GM’s Chinese partners.

However, the ad has the financial relationship backwards. Those 2011 profits from China, about $1.3 billion, were something the firm had counted on for years.

""Even before the recession, GM was losing lots in America but making lots of money in China,"" said Kim Hill, an analyst with the Center for Automotive Research, a group that has many funders, including automakers. ""Sales in China were keeping the company afloat.""

Aaron Bragman with IHS Automotive, a financial research group, underscored that China is one of GM’s most profitable regions.

""They're the largest, most popular automaker in China, actually,"" Bragman said. ""The fact that seven out of 10 vehicles GM makes are not sold here but are actually sold abroad is a testament to the company's successful international business plans, not some crazy scheme to steal money from Americans to spend it elsewhere.""

When we asked Hanna for evidence to support the ad's message, he emphasized that the GM CEO, Dan Akerson, was caught on camera saying ""Our commitment to work .. for China remains strong.""

""If the average voter knew that the president of GM who had been installed by the president,"" Hanna said, ""for a company that had been kept afloat by enormous infusion of taxpayer dollars, was bragging he was working for China, they would be shocked.""

GM spokesman Greg Martin, has two responses.

""Akerson was never appointed by the president,"" Martin said. Akerson put his name forward when the previous CEO, who had been appointed by the White House, said he wanted to step down. The GM board gave Akerson the job in August 2010.

As for Akerson’s comments about working for China, Martin says that was a speech aimed at Chinese auto dealers and suppliers. It was a marketing pitch to assure them that GM thought they were important.

We watched the entire speech. The clip used in the ad was Akerson’s summation, after he promised that GM would be a good corporate citizen, focused on sustainable development and ready to be part of the communities in which it operates.

""Our goal is to play a significant role in the social and economic changes that bring a better life to China’s citizens,"" Akerson said.

""You could take any snippet of a speech and twist it anyway you want,"" Martin said. ""The context was, this was the sort of rousing speech you could find daily from an auto executive whether he was talking to suppliers in the U.S., members of a chamber of commerce, or state and local officials.""

Overseas production

The ad highlights that seven out of 10 GM vehicles are produced outside the United States. However, it fails to note that seven out of 10 GM vehicles are also sold outside the United States. GM officials says this is part of long-standing strategy to ""build where we sell.""

The ad uses a peculiar device to suggest that GM China’s gains come at the expense of American jobs. It cites a CNN article as saying ""GM, which closed 13 plants in the U.S. ... opened 15 plants in China.""

We found the original article. The full sentence ended with, ""opened 15 plants in China in the last 10 years."" The quote in the ad obscures that the time frames are entirely different. It blends decisions made years ago with those made more recently.

Our ruling

The ad claims that taxpayer dollars propped up GM’s operations in China.

While the collapse of GM would have presented the GM-China joint ventures with many problems, the bailout money itself didn’t help China so much as allow GM to continue to draw money out of China. In fact, the Chinese operations were making money and supporting themselves through sales in China.

The ad makes several other errors of fact, including saying that the current GM CEO was appointed by Obama when he was not. Plus, the ad suggests that if GM says it is working for China, that must mean it is not working for the United States. It reinforces this idea by selectively quoting from a news article.

"['City Government', 'Texas', 'Gonzalo Barrientos']","
Gonzalo Barrientos says 55% of council members have come from area where only 10% of Austinites live
","
As voters began choosing between two approaches to electing the Austin City Council, Gonzalo Barrientos urged them to look at local history.

""Since 1971, City Council members have been elected through a system that encourages unequal representation -- 10 percent of the population lives in an area that receives 55 percent of the representation,"" he wrote in an opinion piece that ran in the Austin American-Statesman on Oct. 22, 2012, the day early voting started for the Nov. 6 election.

Barrientos, who long represented Austin in the Texas House and Senate, asked readers to support the plan offered by Austinites for Geographic Representation, which collected more than 20,000 petition signatures to get it on the ballot where it now faces a competing proposal from Mayor Lee Leffingwell and other council members, according to a Sept. 15, 2012, Statesman news story.

The group’s ""10-1"" proposal would switch the council from seven members elected citywide to 10 members elected within smaller districts and the mayor elected citywide, according to an Oct. 4, 2012, Statesman news story. The competing ""8-2-1"" proposal would set up eight district representatives and two citywide seats plus the mayor, the story said.

Barrientos’ statement could be read as implying that leaders who are elected citywide actually represent only the interests of the area where they live, a contention that we don't find factually checkable. So we looked into his declared percentages.

He told us by phone that he relied on information from Peck Young, who according to the Sept. 15 Statesman story leads the Geographic Representation group and has advocated for district representation since the 1970s.

Young told us in a phone interview that the group was hungry for data on this topic last year as it researched proposals. The information behind Barrientos’ statement, he said, came from a map and research that appeared Aug. 4, 2011, on an investigative reporting website, The Austin Bulldog.

Young’s group spot-checked the data against city records, found it reliable and ""ran with it,"" he said. Separately, Austin city demographer Ryan Robinson told us he also found the research, compiled by Bulldog editor Ken Martin, to be reliable: ""He really did his due diligence.""

From 1971 through 2011, Young said, 55 percent of Austin’s elected officials lived in four ZIP codes -- 78701, 78703, 78731 and 78759. The 10 percent population figure, he said, was derived from the 2010 Census totals for Austin and for those four ZIP codes.

The Bulldog’s description of its research said, ""This map indicates where every person who served on the Austin City Council from 1971 through 2011 lived at the time they were elected.""

The Bulldog report said its research started with 1971 because that was the year voters started electing the mayor. Previously, mayors were chosen by council votes.

That gave a total of 17 mayors and 100 council members, according to the Bulldog analysis, which argued that Austin power has been too concentrated in select areas. ""Forty-nine of those seats were won by people who lived in West and Northwest Austin,"" the Bulldog said.

We spot-checked a dozen addresses shown in the Bulldog’s interactive map and found only minor discrepancies. For instance, former Council Member Brigid Shea told us by telephone that she moved from the French Place neighborhood, which has the 78722 ZIP code, to the 78701 address shown for her by the Bulldog about two years into her council term. The Bulldog website asks that readers send notice of any mistakes they spot; we make the same request.

For more detail, Young pointed us to Martin, who founded the Bulldog in 2010 after journalism  jobs including editor of the Austin Business Journal and past founder-owner of a City Hall news service, InFact Daily.

Martin told us in a phone interview that his starting point was a similar project that city demographer Robinson worked on in the 2000s. He supplemented that information with more city records and candidate financial statements, interviews and historical materials including old Austin phonebooks, Martin said.

According to his data, which he called up on his computer and crunched for us during the interview, those four ZIP codes accounted for 58 of the 117 city offices filled in Austin elections (City Council including mayor) from 1971 through 2011.

That divides out to 49.6 percent, not 55 percent.

We asked Young for help clarifying the discrepancy, and he sent us calculations that he said were made by a volunteer during the group’s research. From that spreadsheet, it appears mayors were double-counted by adding the number of mayors to the number of ""council members,"" a category that in Martin’s data already included mayors. If mayors are double-counted, our math shows a result of 54.9 percent; if the mayors are, properly, counted once, we get 49.6 percent.

Young said the double-counting explanation seemed likely to him. ""You and Ken may have found out my young person, who was a college student, had made a boo-boo,"" he said. But, he said, ""58 is still half of all city elected officials that have come from these four ZIP codes in 40 years. So our basic point is still true even if our math is faulty.""

We also wondered whether the cited ZIP codes had been home to 10 percent of Austinites throughout those decades. 
Geographic Representation group spokeswoman Jessica Ellison said their research was limited to 2010 because they didn’t have Census numbers for all 40 years.

Barrientos’ statement could be read as applying to the entire period, though, so we decided to check as best we could.

A 2010 U.S. Census Bureau breakdown of the nation’s most populous cities gave Austin’s population as 790,390. So a tenth would be 79,390.

Beginning in 2000, the Census Bureau has used ZIP Code Tabulation Areas rather than ZIP codes for its calculations, in order to have clearly defined boundaries that didn’t move as postal delivery logistics changed. An individual ZCTA (which the Census Bureau says you should pronounce ZIK-tah) is roughly equivalent, though not identical, to its corresponding ZIP code.

The 2010 counts for ZCTAs corresponding to the four ZIP codes are: 78701 population 6,841; 78703 population 19,690; 78731 population 24,614; and 78759 population 38,891.

These add up to 90,036 people, or 11.4 percent of Austin’s 2010 population.

Robinson and Census librarian Asheleigh Perry told us the city and the Census Bureau Library don’t have 1970-1990 Austin populations by ZIP code.

We did find on the Census website the 2000 ZCTA counts that correspond to the 2010 numbers above. Those totals are: 78701 population 3,855; 78703 population 19,585; 78731 population 24,059; and 78759 population 1,530.

That adds up to 49,029; divide by Austin’s 2000 population of 656,562 and you get 7.5 percent -- an even smaller slice of the city than in 2010.

Population numbers aside, Robinson told us he believed the overall point is valid: Council members ""have indeed come from a concentrated part of the city,"" he said. ""The distribution of mayors over time has been even more concentrated.""

Our ruling

Barrientos wrote, ""10 percent of the population lives in an area that receives 55 percent of the representation,"" citing the system in place since 1971. Young later specified that the area is four ZIP codes.

Leaving out the implication that officials only advocate for their home neighborhoods, the 55 percent calculation is slightly off due to a double-counting of mayors. All told, it looks like 50 percent of Austin’s council members (including mayors) have come from those ZIPs over the past four decades.

In 2010, the ZIPs were home to 11 percent of the city’s population; in 2000, the ZIPs were home to 7 percent of the city’s population, arguably reinforcing Barrientos’ point.

Lois Frankel's mayoral bathroom takes a hit in Adam Hasner attack ad
","
The battle between congressional candidates Lois Frankel and Adam Hasner has fallen into the toilet.

Democrat Frankel and Republican Hasner are competing in the South Florida Congressional 22 district that is currently home to U.S. Rep. Allen West who has switched districts.

In Hasner’s ad ""Gotta Go"" the incensed female narrator says:

""That Lois Frankel is something. She gave herself a 40 percent pay raise. Charged us for a police helicopter ride to go to a dinner party. But the worst part? Frankel spent over $13,000 in taxpayer money on a marble shower in a private bathroom with her own toilet. What a waste. All that money right down the drain for her own personal use,"" says the narrator, as a close-up of her hand is shown flushing a white toilet.

Now the screen reveals that our narrator is sitting on a toilet next to a roll of toilet paper and a white shower curtain:

""When you gotta go, you gotta go, but that’s just ridiculous.""

We’ve already checked a PAC claim about whether Frankel gave herself a 40 percent pay raise while the city lost jobs (Half True) and Hasner’s claim that she took a ride in a helicopter ride to a party (Half True).

Here we go for a deep dive about that taxpayer-funded bathroom. We will focus our fact-check on whether Frankel spent $13,000 on a marble shower in a private bathroom at City Hall. We will also touch on why she got that bathroom and how it ended up with marble.

The origin of the bathroom claim

Frankel suggested that PolitiFact personally inspect the bathroom which is now in the office of mayor Jeri Muoio. So we traveled to inspect the bathroom in West Palm Beach city hall on Oct. 22.

The bathroom does have beige marble on the floor and a stand-up shower. Large marble tiles cover the main part of the bathroom floor and the shower walls. The bathroom also has a standard white toilet, a sink and narrow cherry wood shelves for towels and plastic blinds over the windows. It looks like a bathroom in a new hotel, but it’s not luxurious or palatial. (View photos from the Palm Beach Post.)

First, some background about the city hall which was part of a controversial $150 million City Center project that included a library, photo center and parking garage. Frankel was a leader in getting the project built but in West Palm Beach the mayor only votes if there is a tie. That means that the City Commission voted to build the project. City spokesman Elliot Cohen said there were multiple votes about the project but no tie votes. Hasner’s campaign notes that when Frankel broke a tie to fill a commission vacancy in 2006 she chose a City Center supporter.

The bathroom controversy started with media coverage about the new city hall from then Palm Beach Post gossip columnist Jose Lambiet. (He now has his own website and writes a column for the Miami Herald, a PolitiFact Florida partner.)

""Yes, marble, as in most Palm Beach mansions. In the middle of a recession,"" Lambiet wrote in 2009. ""Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer!""

The column quoted Frankel:

""In the big scheme of things, it was probably a minuscule cost,"" Frankel said. ""I didn't ask for it. The designer did. I don't even know if I'll ever use the shower. But this building was constructed to last 100 years, and it's not been built for me. It's been built for mayors after me.""

Lambiet wrote several weeks later that a statement by the builder, Dan Catalfumo, showed that the ""bathroom/shower"" in Frankel’s office cost $13,323.

The cost for plumbing the entire city hall was $1.6 million and the value of stone and tiles was $1.2 million, Lambiet wrote.

""For privacy, security, and job efficiency reasons, the designers included a private bath within the mayor's office,"" Frankel spokesman Chase Scott said at the time. ""It is a small, commercial grade facility, and its cost was in the same range as the other bathrooms in city hall.""

Scott no longer works for the city, but when PolitiFact Florida contacted him, he said Frankel did not request the marble.

""Lois Frankel did not design or have any input into the materials used, as they were all selected by the architect. I know this because at the time City Center was completed we gave tours, and I needed all the design information,""  Scott told us in an email.

Scott said he had requested the bathroom be part of the mayor’s office because mayors work into the evening, are often outdoors in the heat, and have to hold press conferences, ""I believed it was a good idea for all future mayors to have the ability to freshen up, as their office is often their real home.""

Did the shower cost $13,000?

Hasner's ad states that the shower alone cost $13,000, but we couldn’t find any documents to support that claim.

Lambiet said he no longer had that builder’s statement from 2009, and we could not reach Catalfumo. (He now has much bigger  problems.)

Frankel’s campaign sent us to two sources -- project architect Young Song and project executive J.J.  Wolfe who worked with Catalfumo.

""We never designed a marble shower,"" said architect Young Song. According to the plans, the mayor’s bathroom was supposed to be tile.

Wolfe said he used marble that was left over from another job, so it didn’t add to the project tab.

""We thought we are doing something nice, and it turned into big fiasco. The marble was free, so it seemed like a reasonable thing to do at time,"" Wolfe said. ""If I could take back, I would put in the  ugliest pink polka-dotted tile in there I could come up with.""

Wolfe said $13,000 for the shower was an inflated figure that didn’t reflect the actual costs. It was based on an average for the bathroom that the builder came up with based on the plumbing, figures and materials, Wolfe said.

Frankel said that in the old city hall, people would sometimes follow her into the bathroom, which was a security risk. In case of hurricanes, mayors have to work around the clock, too. So while she didn’t ask for the private bathroom, she didn’t veto it, either.  ""I thought it was a good idea, and I still do,"" she said. She left her successor a shower cap when she left office in 2011.

Hasner’s bathroom access

To be fair, we researched the bathroom access Hasner had when he was a state legislator including House Majority leader. He had no special private bathroom, his campaign said.

""There is no bathroom in the Majority Leader's personal office or the larger majority office, said Ryan Duffy, spokesman for the House speaker. ""The closest bathroom is the public bathroom in the hallway outside the majority office.""

Our ruling

At last, we are ready to close the lid on this claim.

Hasner’s ad said that Frankel ""spent $13,000 in taxpayer money on a marble shower in a private bathroom."" The underlying message here is that Frankel engaged in government waste.

But Frankel didn’t have some sort of sole power here to make that bathroom happen. It was part of a much broader $150 million project approved by the City Commission.

The city built a new city hall while Frankel was mayor that included a private bathroom for her. A gossip columnist obtained a statement from the builder at the time that said the ""bathroom/shower"" cost $13,323. We were unable to see that statement for ourselves.

Hasner’s campaign says the shower alone cost $13,000. But the project executive who worked for the builder said that was the cost of the overall bathroom. And the builder decided to use that marble -- which wasn’t in the architect’s plans -- because it was leftover from another job. There is no evidence that Frankel ordered up that marble.

Whether a mayor needs a private bathroom and shower with or without marble is a decision we leave for the taxpayers. But we have seen no proof that the shower alone cost $13,000 -- that appears to be the overall price tag for the bathroom which was part of a $150 million project.

Adam Hasner says Lois Frankel used a police chopper to get to dinner party
","
Republican congressional candidate Adam Hasner has accused his Democratic opponent Lois Frankel of hitching a ride on a police chopper that rushed her to a party when she was mayor of West Palm Beach.

The incensed female narrator in Republican Hasner’s ad ""Gotta Go"" says:

""That Lois Frankel is something. She gave herself a 40 percent pay raise. Charged us for a police helicopter ride to go to a dinner party. But the worst part? Frankel spent over $13,000 in taxpayer money on a marble shower in a private bathroom with her own toilet. What a waste. ""All that money right down the drain for her own personal use,"" says the narrator, who is revealed to be sitting on a toilet.""When you gotta go, you gotta go but that’s just ridiculous.""

The claims in the ad are similar to an ad by the YG Action Fund, a conservative PAC which showed Frankel’s headshot inside a cartoon image of a helicopter flying near a mansion with balloons falling from the sky. We fact-checked a claim by the PAC that Frankel got a 40 percent pay raise while the city of West Palm Beach lost jobs. We rated that claim Half True because the pay raise was correct but the ad failed to accurately explain the jobs picture. We also looked at whether Frankel spent money on a marble shower. We rated that Half True as well.

In this fact-check we will focus on Hasner’s claim that Frankel took a ride in the city’s helicopter to go to a dinner party. We aren’t weighing in on whether it was a good decision by Frankel to take that ride -- our role is to evaluate whether Hasner accurately portrayed it.

Hasner and Frankel, both former state legislators who have each raised just shy of $3 million, are competing in the Broward/Palm Beach Congressional District 22. Frankel was mayor of West Palm Beach between 2003 and 2011.

Helicopter ride featured in gossip column

The ad cites an April 2005 Palm Beach Post article by gossip columnist Jose Lambiet. (He now writes a column for the Miami Herald, a PolitiFact Florida partner.)

The article didn’t state the date of the helicopter ride but said ""earlier this year"" Frankel’s aide drove her during rush hour to a homeowner’s association meeting, where she said she was there ""just to shake hands.""

About an hour later, a police chopper landed on the community’s golf course and Frankel was taken to a party downtown. The columnist described it as an affair thrown by ""Clematis-area merchants ticked off about - you guessed it - roadwork.""

""What sounds like a party to you is work for me,"" Frankel said at the time. ""I called in the helicopter with clear instructions that, if there was a public safety emergency, they wouldn't need to come. I don't make a habit of this.""

""I did see all the cars stuck down there. I was thinking: 'Maybe I should do this more often,' "" she said.

Lambiet wrote that Police Chief Delsa Bush didn't know about the mayor’s ride but said, ""The mayor's the boss, and she's welcome to use the chopper. … The county commissioners have police escorts. Why can't the mayor?""

Frankel interview with PolitiFact

When we interviewed Frankel, she said that she never took a city helicopter to a personal  party -- it was a work party.

Frankel said around Christmas she went to a community party on one edge of the city but was also scheduled to host a party hosted by the city’s Downtown Development Authority the same night.

""It was one of those things -- I was supposed to be at two places at one time,"" she said.

We asked Frankel if she used the police helicopter to get to any other events. She said ""Maybe one other time from a work event to another work event. I didn’t go up that often. I am pretty claustrophobic, hydrophobic.""

We noticed that Frankel said the helicopter ride occurred around Christmas time, but Lambiet’s column -- which simply said ""earlier this year"" -- was written April 3. Lambiet told us in an interview that he thought that the chopper ride was a few days before his column was published.

The exact date of the ride wasn’t crucial to rule on Hasner’s claim but we thought it was important to try to pin down exactly which party Frankel had attended.

Frankel’s campaign supplied us with two calendar entries for the mayor on Dec. 22, 2004. The first one states ""5 p.m. Sharp! Ibis Tropical Cheers"" and states that the event would end at six.

The other calendar entry states that from 6 to 8 p.m., Frankel would host a holiday party at Wine Living and includes a contact phone number for the Downtown Development Authority. (Wine Living has since closed.)

The calendar entries don’t specifically discuss the police helicopter. However, both calendar entries state ""required to Arthur Apicella"" in the police department. Frankel’s campaign says that Apicella was in charge of the helicopter at the time and has since retired. Our efforts to reach Apicella were unsuccessful.

We interviewed Art Bullard, Frankel’s executive assistant at the time, who drove her to the event in Ibis.

""That particular event, it was important enough that she made the decision to take the helicopter,"" Bullard said. ""It wasn’t an everyday procedure. I think it happened maybe once or twice.""

Our ruling

Hasner’s ad says that while she was mayor of West Palm Beach, Frankel took a ""police helicopter ride to go to a dinner party.""

But Frankel says she never took the helicopter to get to a private party -- only in her duties as mayor. Public records we found appear to support that.

The ad left open to interpretation whether that was a private party or a mayoral event. So for making that unclear we rate this ad Half True.",/factchecks/2012/oct/25/adam-hasner/adam-hasner-says-lois-frankel-used-police-chopper-/

Jesse Ventura says convicted congressmen, senators can still get retirement in jail
","
Jesse Ventura doesn’t hold back when it comes to criticizing government.

As a former governor of Minnesota, he’s seen his share of politics on both sides of the aisle and details in his new book, ""DemoCRIPS and ReBLOODlicans: No More Gangs in Government,"" why he likens the two mainstream political parties to the infamous street gangs. Ventura notes that while gang activity generally affects neighborhoods, the actions of both parties affect the nation.

""There’s 21 congressmen and senators that have been convicted of felonies that still get their retirement, even in jail,"" Ventura said in an interview with MyCentralJersey.com, ahead of a Sept. 16 appearance at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. ""They don’t have to wait until they’re 65.""

There are quite a few congressmen and senators who have been convicted of felonies, but multiple public databases with conflicting information about the number of convicted federal lawmakers makes it impossible to assess an exact number. We were intrigued, however, by the claim that federal lawmakers can collect taxpayer-funded pensions while incarcerated. And short of those officials being convicted of treason or espionage, it’s true.

Let’s look at how pensions work for members of Congress.

Officials participate in one of two retirement systems, depending on when they were first elected to the House or Senate. But they do not forfeit their pensions or accumulated retirement income if indicted, or convicted of most felonies.

That struck a nerve with the National Taxpayers Union which, in mid-2011, sent a letter to Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, a Republican, to express support for his bill to increase the number of circumstances under which a member of Congress could lose his pension.

""Since the 1980s, NTU has identified lawmakers convicted on charges ranging from bribery to fraud who were each receiving pensions worth tens of thousands of dollars annually (or more) – sometimes while serving prison terms,"" NTU Executive Vice President Pete Sepp wrote. The NTU advocates for lower taxes.

But can a member of Congress simultaneously receive a taxpayer-funded pension while incarcerated?

""The short answer is yes,"" John David, a senior research fellow with the Conservative Heritage Foundation, said in an e-mail. ""Times have changed to some extent, but if the Member is not convicted of one of the offenses that would cost him/her the pension, it will be paid as promised -- even to prison.""

Congressmen and senators can lose their pensions if they are convicted of a national security offense or a crime relating to public corruption and abuse of one’s official position, according to the 2008 Congressional Research Service report ""Status of a Senator Who Has Been Indicted for or Convicted of a Felony.""

So, there are circumstances in which a member of Congress can’t receive pension benefits.

As for the rest of Ventura’s claim, members don’t have to be 65, either, to get their retirement.

A 2007 Congressional Research Service report, ""Retirement Benefits for Members of Congress,"" states members are eligible for a pension at age 62 if they have completed at least five years of service. The age requirement drops to 50 for member with 20 years of service or any age after 25 years of service.

Ventura did not return three requests for comment.

Our ruling

Ventura claimed in an interview that ""there’s 21 congressmen and senators convicted of felonies that still get their retirement, even in jail. They don’t have to wait until they’re 65.""

For this fact-check, we looked only at the claim that federal lawmakers convicted of felonies and can still collect retirement benefits while in jail. We attempted to count the number of convicted national lawmakers, but there are multiple public databases with conflicting information on the number of congressmen and senators convicted of felonies.

In most cases, a congressman or senator convicted of a felony can receive his pension as long as the charge is not one that violates national security or relates to public corruption and abuse of official position.

Members also receive pensions based on completed years of service, not an age requirement of 65.

We rate the claim Mostly True.

Ted Strickland claims John Kasich undersold the condition Ohio's economy was in when he took office
","
As in 2008, Ted Strickland has been among President Barack Obama’s most enthusiastic campaign trail surrogates this year, serving as Obama’s national campaign co-chairman and regularly appearing on national media outlets to urge Obama’s re-election.

The former Ohio governor has also been publicly pondering a rematch against John Kasich, the Republican who defeated him by two percentage points in 2010, and trying to burnish his own legacy as governor by arguing that the state’s economic recovery actually started during Strickland’s term in office.

In an appearance Oct. 7 on CNN’s ""State of the Union"" with Candy Crowley, Strickland touted his own performance as governor as he argued with Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine over whether Obama or Republican Mitt Romney would win Ohio’s presidential vote.

After Crowley showed a clip from Kasich’s Aug. 28 Republican National Convention speech where the current governor argued that Ohio ""needs a new partner in Washington,"" Crowley asked Strickland who’s responsible for Ohio’s relatively good economy.  

Strickland responded by accusing Kasich of ""not telling the truth"" during a part of the speech that immediately followed the excerpt that Crowley showed her viewers.

""He said in that speech that Ohio’s economy was 38th, I believe, in the nation when he took office,"" Strickland told Crowley. ""That’s not true, we were sixth in the nation in terms of economic job growth.""

Ohio’s recovery, Strickland said, began before John Kasich became governor.

""If you look at the data, Ohio’s unemployment declined 1.6 percent in 2010. It declined another 1.7 percent in the first year and a half of the Kasich administration."" Strickland went onto attribute Ohio’s turnaround to the Recovery Act and the auto rescue.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Strickland’s claim that Ohio actually ranked sixth, rather than 38th.

We started with Kasich’s speech. What Kasich actually said was: ""When I came into office, we were 48th in the nation in job creation. "" Later in the speech, Kasich indicated his 48th in the nation comments cited job creation numbers from the four years before he took office -- which corresponds to Strickland’s term.

Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that between Strickland’s inauguration in January 2007 and his departure in January 2011, Ohio lost 372,300 jobs. Only two states - Florida and California - lost more jobs in that time, according to BLS data. That backs up Kasich’s contention that Ohio was 48th in the nation in job creation during the four years before he took office.

We asked Strickland where he got his statistic that Ohio was sixth in economic job growth when Kasich took office. Strickland cited a 2010 report that he said was issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. His aide, Louis Capobianco, subsequently sent an email that provided an August 2010 table compiled by Reed Construction Data, which he said had come from the Federal Reserve report. Our search of reports released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia did not find that table, and the bank’s manager of media relations, Marliyn Wimp, said the bank did not release any reports that classified Ohio as the sixth fastest growing state.

""That must have originated somewhere else,"" she said.

Reed Construction Data, which compiles data for the architectural, engineering and construction industries in North America,did not return PolitiFact Ohio’s calls about the table. It places Ohio behind New Hampshire, North Dakota, West Virginia, Michigan and South Carolina in ""recent economic performance"" over the three months that ended in June of 2010.

Another table on the same page ranked Ohio tenth from the bottom in the ""Change in economic activity index - from 2007-2008 peak index value.""

An article on Reed Construction’s website said the table tracked ""the state economic growth indexes calculated by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank from state employment and income data which are benchmarked to approximately track national GDP growth."" The article said a manufacturing boom had pushed the industrial Great Lakes states past New England as the strongest regional economy after many years at the bottom of the list, and that economic expansion was underway in 46 states.

PolitiFact Ohio also checked whether Strickland’s statements about Ohio’s declining unemployment were correct. BLS data bears out Strickland’s assertion that Ohio’s unemployment rate dropped by 1.6 percent during 2010, Strickland’s last year in office. The state’s unemployment rate fell from 10.6 percent in January of 2010 to 9 percent in January of 2011. From February of 2011 through August of 2012, it fell from 8.9 percent to 7.2 percent, as Strickland said it did.

While Strickland might be correct that Ohio’s economic recovery began on his watch -- the state’s unemployment rate did begin to drop during the last year of his administration --  he was incorrect on the statistics he cited in criticizing Kasich.

The former governor did not accurately cite Kasich’s words when he tried to rebut them on CNN. During his speech, Kasich said that Ohio was 48th in the nation in job creation when he took office. He did not say that the state’s economy was 38th in the nation, as Strickland maintained.  

What’s more, BLS data backs up Kasich’s assertion. Ohio’s rate of job creation did rank 48th relative to other states during Strickland’s term. So Strickland’s statement that Kasich ""was not telling the truth"" was itself incorrect.

And the statistic Strickland cites to support his claim that Ohio actually ranked sixth in economic job growth is misportrayed. That statistic from Reed Construction Data refers to ""recent economic performance,"" not ""economic job growth,"" as Strickland said on CNN. It also examines a narrow three month period of time during 2010 - not the full four years of Strickand’s administration that Kasich’s speech referenced.

CEO of Newport Grand slot parlor says Connecticut gets 25 cents on dollar from casino slot machines and nothing from table games
","
On Election Day, Rhode Islanders will decide whether they want to allow Newport Grand and Twin River, in Lincoln, to offer table games such as roulette and blackjack in addition to their video slot machines.

The two gambling businesses say they need the table games to compete with up to three casinos expected to open  in Massachusetts as early as 2017.

If voters approve the expansion, the state would get up to 18 percent of revenue from those new games. (The state already gets 61 percent from slot machines at Twin River and Newport Grand -- a projected $336 million this year.)

During an Oct. 14, 2012, appearance on WJAR’s ""10 News Conference,"" Newport Grand Chief Executive Officer Diane Hurley said that the 18-percent cut would be a good deal for Rhode Island.

She compared it to what Connecticut gets from table games in that state’s two casinos, Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods.

""Connecticut's take on slot machines is 25 cents on the dollar. And the state's take on table games: zero,"" she said.

We decided to see if she was bluffing or if she had the cards.

We quickly confirmed that Hurley’s numbers were correct.

Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun, are both operated by Native American tribes.The tribes negotiated identical agreements with the state that give Connecticut 25 percent share of slot machine revenue at the casinos. That revenue is defined as the amount of money gamblers put into the machines minus the prize money paid out.

And, as Hurley correctly noted, neither Foxwoods nor Mohegan Sun pays any share of their table game revenue to the state.

Here’s how that arrangement came about.

The Mashantucket Pequots won federal recognition as a sovereign tribe in 1983. The status was significant because under federal law, any form of gambling a state allows can be conducted by a tribe, but without any state regulation.

Connecticut allowed churches and similar charitable organizations to hold bingo nights. In 1986, the tribe used that exemption to open a high-stakes bingo hall on its reservation in Ledyard, Connecticut, with none of the limits on prizes or hours that state law required.

Then, in 1992, the Pequots used a law that allowed charitable casino night events to offer table games like blackjack, roulette and poker, but also free from state regulation. Foxwoods was born.

The federal laws that made the tribe immune from state gambling laws also meant the tribe didn’t have to share its table-game revenues with the state.

But that wasn’t the case with slot machines. Because no state law allowed them under any circumstances, the tribe needed the state’s approval. The result was a 1993 agreement that let the Pequots add slot machines, and gave the state a 25 percent cut of the revenue.

In 1996 the Mohegan tribe opened its casino, Mohegan Sun, in Uncasville under the same arrangement.

Last year, according to the Connecticut gambling division, gamblers dropped $15.7 billion into the approximately 12,500 slot machines at Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods. About 92 percent of that was paid out in jackpots. The rest went to the house, with 25 percent to the state.

Super PAC says Tommy Thompson supports privatizing Social Security
","
Campaign fliers mailed by a labor-backed super PAC go after U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson on his plans to try to rein in the cost of entitlement programs before they run out of funds.

Under the headline, ""Tommy Thompson Just Isn’t the Same,"" the AFL-CIO’s Workers’ Voice charges: ""Thompson supports a radical plan ending Medicare and privatizing Social Security, raising out of pocket costs for seniors and risking their benefits in the stock market.""

The ""end Medicare"" claim has long been leveled against Thompson and other Republicans who endorsed the Medicare reforms in U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s ""Path to Prosperity"" budget in 2012. That claim was named the 2011 ""Lie of the Year"" by Politifact National.

On Oct. 17, 2012, we rated an ""end Medicare"" claim by Ryan congressional opponent Rob Zerban as Pants on Fire.

Medicare would still exist under various versions of Ryan’s entitlement plans, though it would move toward a voucher-style system giving beneficiaries a choice of receiving a fixed government subsidy toward a private insurance plan, or for a plan similar to traditional Medicare.

But what about the claim that Thompson supports ""privatizing Social Security""?

A footnote in the ad pointed us to a March 21, 2012 Fox6 TV online story. The story quoted Thompson during the GOP Senate primary, reacting to Ryan’s budget proposal by saying the ""next U.S. senator will have to take tough votes to reform programs.""

Thompson mentioned Medicare and its looming insolvency, but not Social Security.

So that certainly does not support the claim by the group.

When we asked for further backup, Workers’ Voice spokesman Eddie Vale said the evidence is that Thompson backs the Ryan budget plan. And he said that Ryan’s 2012 budget proposal included privatizing Social Security.

Actually, it didn’t.

We re-read Ryan’s ""Path to Prosperity"" budget documents. The plan listed there calls for action on keeping Social Security solvent, but it doesn’t endorse any particular approach, including ""privatization.""

We went back to Vale, who this time said that he meant Ryan’s separate, earlier proposal, ""A Roadmap for America’s Future.""

That was issued in 2010, well before Thompson launched his Senate bid and later endorsed Ryan’s Path to Prosperity budget proposal. That proposal did include provisions critics have termed ""privatization,"" as did Ryan proposals in 2004, 2005 and 2007.

This is the 2010 ""Roadmap"" proposal to make Social Security sustainable for the long term:
  
    
Vale said those ""personal retirement accounts"" noted in Ryan’s 2010 plan are behind the campaign flier’s accusation of Thompson supporting ""privatizing Social Security.""

But he offered no evidence that Thompson endorsed the Ryan plan from 2010 or his earlier versions with privatization concepts in them.

We couldn’t find any either.

The Ryan ""Path to Prosperity"" budget dropped all mentions of potential privatization, because as PolitiFact noted, he wanted to minimize the chance that Democrats would attack his plan and scotch a chance for a bipartisan deal reforming Social Security.

Ryan, the GOP vice presidential nominee, still favors giving younger Americans a choice of investing on their own within Social Security, as he pointed out in the October 2012 debate with Vice President Joe Biden.

But the claim we’re evaluating is about Thompson.

Let’s dig deeper.

Thompson has long said Social Security will need reforms to save it, though in the 2012 campaign as emphasized it will not start to ""go broke"" until 2038, long after Medicare is scheduled to run into trouble.

His campaign website praises Ryan’s 2012 budget plan, which Thompson’s site says ""makes Social Security solvent"" -- though, as we noted, it does not explain how.

The only Social Security-related proposal we could find by Thompson in the campaign was his repeal of federal taxation on Social Security benefits. Thompson’s website says, ""he will make the repeal budget-neutral by adjusting benefit costs for high-income individuals … The result will be that most Social Security beneficiaries will see reduced income taxes on the money that was theirs in the first place.""

Thompson served under President George W. Bush as secretary of Health and Human Services from 2001 through 2004, a time when Bush was developing a proposal to carve out optional private accounts from Social Security.

Our search of media accounts found that Thompson was occasionally mentioned in news accounts as involved in helping Bush promote the idea -- something that did not win approval.

Nationally, Democrats cite an Oct. 30, 2004, Thompson speech on behalf of Bush’s re-election covered by the Dubuque Telegraph Herald as evidence Thompson backed such accounts.

Here’s the newspaper’s account:

As America's population gets older, there will have to be changes in Medicare and Social Security to keep the programs solvent, he said. In addition to living healthier lives, people should be setting up private retirement accounts and investing in long-term care policies.

""Americans have to start taking responsibility for ourselves,"" Thompson said.

So, Thompson used the term ""private retirement accounts.""

But taken with ""investing in long-term care policies"" and ""taking responsibility for ourselves,"" it’s far from clear he meant people should be allowed to divert their Social Security taxes into private accounts. Based on the wording alone, he may have meant people should set up IRAs and similar accounts with their own savings -- beyond any Social Security payments.

We asked Thompson to discuss his views on Social Security private accounts, past and present. We did not hear back. (His opponent in the Senate race, Democrat Tammy Baldwin, opposes private accounts and says Social Security should be ""off the table"" in deficit-reduction talks.)

One last point: the AFL-CIO flier flatly describes private accounts as ""privatization,"" but it is partial privatization at the most. PolitiFact National gave President Barack Obama a Mostly False in 2010 when he said Republicans were pushing ""privatizing Social Security,"" saying it was a scare tactic by Democrats.

Our rating

The AFL-CIO’s political arm, Workers’ Voice, distributed literature saying that Thompson supports a plan that includes ""privatizing Social Security."" The union cited two plans. But the 2012 plan included no mention of privatizing Social Security. And we could find no evidence Thompson backed the 2010 plan or the earlier ones.

Thompson promoted Bush’s ideas on privatization as a member of his cabinet until 2004.

But that circumstantial evidence, no matter how suggestive, doesn’t help prove this very specific claim that Thompson endorsed a Ryan plan that touted private accounts.

Based on what we know now, we rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2012/oct/25/workers-voice/super-pac-says-tommy-thompson-supports-privatizing/

Barack Obama says Congress owns sequestration cuts
","
In their final debate before the election, President Barack Obama and challenger Mitt Romney each said they would be the staunchest supporter of the military.

Said Romney: ""I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is a combination of the budget cuts the president has, as well as the sequestration cuts. That, in my view, is making ... our future less certain and less secure.""

Obama responded by saying Romney was assigning blame in the wrong place.

""First of all, the sequester is not something that I've proposed. It is something that Congress has proposed. It will not happen,"" Obama said. ""The budget that we are talking about is not reducing our military spending. It is maintaining it.""

Was Obama right that he didn’t propose sequestration and that Congress did?

The story goes back to the debt limit debate of 2011, so let’s start there.
   
Looking for a budget deal in 2011
   
Last year, the United States government was reaching its legal debt limit, which meant Congress had to authorize a higher level for borrowing. Raising the debt limit (also called the debt ceiling) was in some ways symbolic: Congress has the power of the purse, and the decisions to spend the money had already been made.
   
In prior administrations, Congress approved higher debt limits with some partisan sniping (including from then-Sen. Obama against President George W. Bush) but without too much fuss.

But in the summer of 2011, House Republicans insisted that actual spending cuts go along with an increase to the debt limit. House Speaker John Boehner led negotiations with the Obama White House, and at first the two sides seemed to be moving toward a wide-ranging overhaul of the federal budget, referred to in the media as a ""grand bargain.""
   
The closed-door negotiations fell apart, though, and since then journalists have been sorting through a lot of finger-pointing. Some blame Boehner for being unable to deliver his own Republicans on a deal, thanks to tea party opposition to any new taxes. Others blame Obama for his inexperience, for not cultivating relationships with congressional Republicans and for tactical mistakes at negotiating. Some blame both sides.  

At any rate, Republicans and Democrats came to a less ambitious agreement to raise the debt limit through the Budget Control Act of 2011. The law found approximately $1.2 trillion in budget cuts spread over 10 years. But it also directed Congress to find another $1.2 trillion through a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, which came to be known as ""the super-committee.""
   
The super-committee was supposed to meet and agree on a deficit reduction package by Nov. 23, 2011. Their proposal -- which could include tax increases, spending reductions or both -- would then get a filibuster-proof, up-or-down vote in Congress.
   
As an incentive to the super-committee, the law included an unusual kind of budget threat: If the super-committee couldn’t agree on a package, or if Congress voted it down, then automatic, across-the-board cuts would go into effect, with half of those cuts hitting defense. These automatic cuts are referred to as ""sequestration.""

A story in USA Today referred to sequestration as ""the trigger mechanism on a budget bomb.""
   
Lo and behold, the super-committee didn’t agree on a deficit reduction package, so Congress never voted on it. Sequestration is now set to take effect with the 2013 budget.
   
Whose sequester?
   
In the debate, Obama said he didn’t propose sequestration, Congress did. (We asked the White House for comment, but didn't hear back.)

To determine the question of ownership, we turned to Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward’s new book The Price of Politics.

Woodward’s reporting shows clearly that defense sequestration was an idea that came out of Obama’s White House. But the intention was to force Republicans to negotiate, not to actually put the cuts into effect.

Woodward summarizes the thoughts of the Obama team: ""There would be no chance the Republicans would want to pull the trigger and allow the sequester to force massive cuts to Defense."" Democrats, meanwhile, didn’t want to see their favorite domestic programs cut.
   
As the negotiations proceeded, Republicans seemed to think the same thing.
   
""Boehner told the House Republican leadership and other key members not to worry about the sequester … ‘Guys, this would be devastating to Defense,’ he said. ‘This would be devastating, from their perspective, on their domestic priorities. This is never going to happen,’"" Woodward wrote.
   
Nonetheless, sequestration is now looming.

We recently  looked at a Romney campaign ad that blamed Obama for the sequester and talked to several experts about who is more responsible for the looming cuts -- Congress or the president. Some say that the Obama White House proposed sequestration, so that means Obama owns it.
   
""While both parties are culpable for sequestration because the Budget Control Act passed Congress, the president proposed it originally and ultimately owns its outcome,"" said Mackenzie Eaglen, an expert on defense with the conservative American Enterprise Institute and an adviser to the Romney campaign. ""That is because he alone can lead by calling the party leaders together for a resolution today if he wanted as president.""
   
Other see the two parties as co-owners of sequestration, especially since Republicans in Congress voted for the law that set up its possibility. In the House, 174 Republicans and 95 Democrats voted for the law, while 66 Republicans and 95 Democrats opposed it. (Final tally: Passed 269-161.) In the Senate, 28 Republicans and 45 Democrats voted for it, while 19 Republicans and 6 Democrats opposed it. (Final tally: Passed 74-26)
   
""The logic that lays the blame for sequestration at Obama's feet, because he negotiated the BCA with GOP leaders in Congress, could just as easily apply to those other negotiators, or, indeed, any member of Congress who voted for the BCA in August 2011,"" said Christopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Preble favors reductions to the defense budget.
   
""I do not believe it accurate to refer to the cuts that will occur in both defense and non-defense discretionary spending under sequestration as ‘Obama's cuts,’"" he said.
   
Woodward, after Monday’s debate, reiterated what he said in his book -- and that Obama was off the mark in the debate.

""What the president said is not correct,"" Woodward told POLITICO. ""He’s mistaken. And it’s refuted by the people who work for him.""


Our ruling
   
Obama said that the sequester -- and the defense cuts that would result from it -- was not his proposition. ""It is something that Congress has proposed,"" he said in the debate.

But it was Obama’s negotiating team that came up with the idea for defense cuts in 2011, though they were intended to prod Congress to come up with a better deal for reining in the deficit, not as an effort to make those cuts reality.
   
Meanwhile, members of both parties in Congress voted for the legislation that set up the possibility of sequestration. Obama’s position is that Congress should now act to avoid those across-the-board cuts.
   
Obama can’t rightly say the sequester isn’t his, but he did need cooperation from Congress to get to this point. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/oct/24/barack-obama/obama-says-congress-owns-sequestration-cuts/
"['National', 'Debates', 'Military', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama says Romney would spend $2 trillion that the military hasn't asked for
","
Republican nominee Mitt Romney has said he plans to increase defense spending by about $2 trillion over the next 10 years if he’s elected president. In the final debate of the campaign, moderator Bob Scheiffer asked Romney, ""Where are you going to get the money?""

Romney said he would take it from other parts of the budget -- by abolishing Obamacare and by changing Medicaid to a block grant and turning it over to the states.

President Barack Obama said Romney’s plan for more defense spending is a bad idea, because it isn’t necessary. Romney ""wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for,"" Obama said.

In this fact-check, we examine the claim that Romney is promoting something the top brass don’t want.

Romney has outlined out his national security policy on his website. There, he warned that restoring the military ""will not be a cost-free process,"" and said he will ""begin by reversing Obama-era defense cuts ... with the goal of setting core defense spending — meaning funds devoted to the fundamental military components of personnel, operations and maintenance, procurement, and research and development — at a floor of 4 percent of GDP.""

 What’s 4 percent worth?

The Pentagon’s budget is expected to run in the range of 3.2 to 3.5 percent of GDP in the next fiscal year. According to the Center for a New American Security, a group with ties to both Republican and Democratic administrations, even a gradual ramp up to 4 percent would increase defense spending by $2.1 trillion over the next ten years, as reported by CNN.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group focused on deficit reduction, uses that number too, as do other budget think tanks. Romney seems to accept it, so as far as the $2 trillion figure goes, it seems reasonably accurate.

In the past, when asked about increasing defense spending in tough economic times, the Romney campaign has emphasized that the 4-percent goal will take some time to achieve.

While the campaign website describes the goal as ""a floor"", campaign spokesperson Andrea Saul called it ""a target"" in an email to a Boston Globe reporter. The first priority, Saul wrote, is to reverse ""Obama-era defense cuts.""

In the same article, one Romney adviser, Mackenzie Eaglen with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said, ""That’s not a hard number and anybody would be crazy to suggest it is. It would have to be a very slow ramp-up and they would be hard-pressed to even achieve a 4 percent base budget by the end of the first term.’’

This suggests there is some flexibility on Romney’s part, although the candidate himself has not expressed that.

 What the Pentagon is asking for

In the debate, Romney said, ""Our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917. The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission. We're now at under 285.""

In fact, the 313-ship plan reflects a 2005 strategic review. In April, the Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, presented a new program that sets a goal of 300 ships. Mabus’s remarks came at a moment when Romney had been vocal in his opposition to the new approach.

""A lot of this criticism is based on either incomplete and/or inaccurate or outdated information, or a failure to see beyond the short term or a willingness to protect the status quo in spite of the changing world and in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary,"" he said.

The president’s budget calls for $487 billion in defense savings between now and 2021. His defense secretary, Leon Panetta, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, have both spoken up for the plan, as have the heads of all five branches of the military.

""We are developing today the Joint Force the nation will need in 2020,"" Dempsey told the Senate budget committee. ""We will be a military that is able to do more than one thing at a time—to win any conflict, anywhere.""

Panetta acknowledged that the budget comes with risks but he said the department’s plan was based on looking first at the threats the nation might face.

""The department would need to make a strategic shift regardless of the nation's fiscal situation.,"" Panetta told the budget committee. ""We are at that point in history. That's the reality of the world we live in.""

Administration critics say the reality was just the reverse. A report from the conservative Heritage Foundation said, ""the administration set a goal of slashing the defense budget, and then crafted a strategy justifying such draconian cuts.""

The president is the commander-in-chief. Panetta works for Obama and the military answers to him. To the analysts at the Heritage Foundation, the chain of command says it all. But in the past, when military commanders have disagreed with presidents, they have found ways to get their complaints to the public.

This is not to say that all commanders are pleased with the trade-offs they face. But Nora Bensahel, deputy director of studies at the Center for New American Security, said she believes the president put a great deal of time into discussions with the military, and by and large, the commanders support the plan.

""It’s hard to see daylight between the military and the White House on this,"" Bensahel said.

Broadly speaking, it is always possible that the service chiefs would disagree over funding of individual programs but that is within the overall budget limits.

 Our ruling

The president said Romney planned to increase defense spending by $2 trillion and that was money the military hadn’t asked for.

Military leaders have testified in support of the president’s spending plan, and we found no evidence of disagreement behind the scenes.
