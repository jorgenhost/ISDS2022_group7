No, that Gene Hackman quote about Trump is misattributed and incomplete
","Gene Hackman thinks Donald Trump may turn out to be one of the best presidents in American history. Well, at least that’s what one post recently shared on Facebook claims. Featuring a photo of Hackman, the post attributes the following quote to the actor: ""Donald Trump could easily turn out to be one of the best presidents that America has ever seen."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Nope. Hackman didn’t say that. The quote is an incomplete version of something said by the late Peter Stringfellow, an English businessman who owned several nightclubs. We traced the misattribution to the junk website coolinfo24.com, which posted a now-deleted, incoherent article in November 2018 with the headline: ""HOLLYWOOD LEGEND GENE HACKMAN: ‘DONALD TRUMP COULD EASILY TURN OUT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST PRESIDENTS THAT AMERICA HAS EVER SEEN.’"" The article claimed that while Hackman was being interviewed ""not long ago,"" he spoke about meeting Trump in the 1980s at a party Hackman threw in New York. Eventually, the post states that Hackman said he was shocked when he first heard Trump was to be the Republican nominee, but after a ""year"" of his presidency said: ""So what do I think about Trump now? It is possible he could turn out to be one (of) the best presidents that America has ever seen. His initial year is fascinating he made numerous of positive changes. Just keep on doing the same, Mr. President!"" Not only did Hackman not say this, this version of Stringfellow’s quote is altered and incomplete. After Stringfellow passed away in June 2018, the South Yorkshire Times published a story about the time the nightclub owner met Trump – at Hackman’s New York party in the 80s – which was reportedly thrown at one of Stringfellow’s clubs. The news article says: ""Writing shortly after his inauguration as president in 2017, Stringfellow wrote: ‘Yes – I have met Donald Trump – back in the ’80s. Gene Hackman threw a party at my club in New York, and Donald was a guest ... So what do I think about Trump? It is possible he could turn out to be one (of) the best presidents that America has ever seen … or one of the worst! As they say time will tell.’"" A quote floating around social media claims Hackman once said that Trump could ""easily turn out to be one of the best presidents that America has ever seen."" The statement was not made by Hackman. It belongs to late English nightclub owner Peter Stringfellow, and the quote was  cut short, omitting that Stringfellow also said, ""or one of the worst!""

Trump said 52% of women voted for him in 2016. That’s misleading. It refers only to white women
","ABC News’ chief anchor George Stephanopoulos spent two days following and interviewing President Donald Trump ahead of Trump’s re-election campaign kick-off in Florida. In one of a series of interviews, Stephanopoulos asked Trump about his pitch to undecided swing voters. ""Safety, security, great economy,"" Trump said, before veering off to his 2016 victory and claiming that he ""did very well"" with women voters. Stephanopoulos pushed back, pointing out that Trump ""didn't win women"" in 2016. ""Well, I got 52%,"" Trump said, according to an ABC News transcript. ""And I will tell you — in my opinion I might have won women. ... Hey, Hillary Clinton focused on women, and I did phenomenally well. Many, many, many points above what they thought."" This wasn’t the first time Trump mentioned the 52%. At a March 2018 rally in Pennsylvania, Trump told the crowd: ""Hey, didn’t we surprise them with women during the election? Remember? ‘Women won’t like Donald Trump.’ I said, ‘Have I really had that kind of a problem? I don‘t think so.’ But, ‘Women won’t like Donald Trump. It will be a rough night for Donald Trump because the women won’t come out.’ We got 52%. Right? 52. Right?"" Trump’s 52% claim is misleading, because it only refers to a subset of women — white women. He didn’t specify that during the March 2018 rally nor in the ABC interview nor during five other events we found him citing the statistic. The Trump campaign declined to comment. ""The exit polls make it clear that Trump did not win women,"" said Jennifer Lawless, Commonwealth professor of politics at the University of Virginia. Pundits believed Trump would not do well with women because he was running against someone who could become the country’s first woman president and because of sexual assault allegations against him. However, regardless of the candidate, one’s political party identification is the best indicator of whom a voter will elect — and white women consistently vote Republican, political science researchers told PolitiFact. ""Political party is by far the greatest predictor of presidential vote choice, beyond ideology, gender, race and other factors,"" said Rebecca Kreitzer, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""This is why it isn't surprising Republican women voted for Trump — partisanship is a stronger predictor of vote choice than gender."" Trump didn’t win a majority of the women vote in 2016. He received 41%, while 54% of women voted for Hillary Clinton, according to exit poll data conducted by Edison Research. Trump, however, did garner 52% of white women votes. Overall, he won 52% of votes by men and 62% of votes by white men, exit poll data suggests.   However, ""exit polls do not always paint an accurate portrait of the electorate,"" said Ashley Jardina, an assistant professor of political science at Duke University. ""They are not random and nationally representative and tend to overreport the voting behavior of people willing to stop and talk to pollsters."" Jardina pointed to a study by the Pew Research Center that used data on confirmed 2016 voters and attempted to account for bias in exit polls. According to the Pew study, 39% of all women voted for Trump, as did 47% of white women. (No group of women voters supported him at 52% or above.) Analysis of national election data has consistently shown that white women favor Republican candidates over Democratic ones, Jardina said. The gender gap in the 2016 presidential election was the highest ever recorded in the history of exit polls, according to data from Edison Research cited by the Washington Post. This gender gap of 24 points isn’t that shocking in context with recent elections, said Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, because it has been steadily increasing since Reagan’s election in 1980. ""That doesn’t mean that the GOP candidate can’t win women,"" said Lawless, the University of Virginia professor. ""But it’s a tougher road."" Support from women is a consistent talking point for Trump. Before Election Day in 2016, he falsely claimed to have ""tremendous"" support from women, even though, on average, he lagged behind Clinton in the polls. He also claimed that Clinton didn't ""do very well with women"" — polling data showed that his claim was Pants on Fire. Trump said, ""Well, I got 52% (of women voters). And I will tell you — in my opinion I might have won women. ... Hey, Hillary Clinton focused on women, and I did phenomenally well."" According to exit poll data, 41% of all women voted for Trump in 2016. Trump’s 52% claim refers to his share of white women. Another measure from a Pew Research Center study — using only validated voters and taking potential bias of exit polling into account — found that 39% of all women and 47% of white women voted for Trump. Trump’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Seth Moulton partly right on Biden not admitting he was wrong on the Iraq War
","Joe Biden’s vote as a senator to authorize the use of force against Iraq might have come over 16 years ago, but his critics, and his primary opponents, don’t want the public to forget. As soon as he announced in late April, a progressive Democratic group dinged him for ""voting for the Iraq War."" We found the group’s claim was basically accurate, but needed some context. In early June, presidential candidate Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., took Biden to task again — this time after Biden flipped his position on the Hyde Amendment, a provision that bars Washington from spending federal money to pay for abortions. ""Bravo to @JoeBiden for doing the right thing and reversing his longstanding support for the Hyde Amendment,"" Moulton, a former U.S. Marine who served in Iraq, wrote in a June 7 tweet. ""It takes courage to admit when you're wrong, especially when those decisions affect millions of people. Now do the Iraq War."" Moulton’s tweet is based on a faulty premise. Moulton says that Biden admitted he was wrong about the Hyde Amendment. He didn’t. He said he changed his stance due to a change in circumstances. As for Biden’s vote for a resolution that cleared the way for the Iraq War, he called it a mistake, but without admitting he was wrong. We took a close look at his words on both topics. The ways Biden approached his shift on these two issues have more in common with one another than Moulton's tweet suggests. By the fall of 2002, the drum beat from President George W. Bush’s administration on Iraq President Saddam Hussein and his nation’s purported weapons programs left little doubt that military action was imminent. Senate Democrats split — 29 in favor and 21 against — over whether to approve a resolution that would give Bush a free hand to launch an attack. Political scientist John Pitney at Claremont McKenna College said that Biden saw his vote for the resolution as making war less likely. ""Biden explained the authorization to use military force as a way to compel Iraq to abandon WMDs,"" Pitney said. ""He even said, ‘I believe that failure to overwhelmingly support this resolution is likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur.’"" In the late hours of Oct. 11, 2002, Biden justified his vote by amplifying Bush’s own words about avoiding war. ""He said that quote, ‘war is neither imminent nor inevitable’,"" Biden said. ""And that he desired to lead the world and, if war was necessary, it would be with allies at our side."" Biden said the resolution wasn’t perfect, but it leaned toward working with the international community to get Iraq to comply with U.N. resolutions. The war started in March 2003. In 2004, Biden reflected on the vote he had cast. ""A year and a half ago, I voted to give President Bush the authority to use force in Iraq, Biden wrote in an op-ed. ""I still believe my vote was just — but the president's use of that authority was unwise in ways I never imagined."" By late 2005, the Iraq operation had unravelled. The weapons of mass destruction were nowhere to be found. Biden was asked on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" in November of that year if he thought his vote was a mistake. ""It was a mistake,"" Biden said on the show. ""It was a mistake to assume the president would use the authority we gave him properly."" Biden continued: ""We gave the president the authority to unite the world to isolate Saddam. And the fact of the matter is we went too soon. We went without sufficient force. And we went without a plan."" Biden’s Iraq War vote dogged him when he ran for the nomination in 2008, and he stuck to the same message. Interviewed again on ""Meet the Press"" in 2007, Biden characterized his ""mistake"" less as a failure of his own judgment than as a failure of the Bush administration. ""I regret having believed that this administration had any competence,"" Biden said. ""It is the most incompetent administration I’ve ever — if I’d known they were going to misuse the authority we gave them the way they did, if I’d known that they were going to, once they used it, be so incompetent in the using of it, I would have never ever, ever given them the authority."" Moulton spokesman Matt Corridoni told us that while Biden might have expressed regret, his words were ""not very comprehensive."" And Corridoni said there’s the issue of timing. ""He hasn't addressed it yet as a 2020 candidate like he has Hyde,"" Corridoni said. With the Hyde Amendment, Biden justified his shift on the grounds that access to abortion is under threat. He pointed to efforts to shutter Planned Parenthood clinics and limits tied to the Affordable Care Act. ""We now see so many Republican governors denying health care to millions of the poorest and most vulnerable Americans by refusing even Medicaid expansion,"" Biden said. ""I can't justify leaving millions of women without access to the care they need and the ability to exercise their constitutionally protected right."" Biden painted his shift as the product of compassion and pragmatism, not contrition. It was about the states’ moves to restrict access. ""I make no apologies in my last position,"" he said. ""I don't want to mislead you. If in fact, it (abortion service) was still available, I think, just as I've never attempted to impose my views on anyone else as to when life begins, I have never attempted to impose my view on who should pay for it."" ""But folks, times have changed,"" Biden added. Moulton said Biden hasn’t admitted he was wrong on the Iraq War. And for Moulton, that was in stark contrast to Biden’s headline-making reversal on the Hyde Amendment. It is fair to say that Biden never said that it was wrong to go into Iraq under any circumstances. Rather, he expressed regret for having thought that Bush would wisely use the authority he had been given. We leave it to others to decide if that is sufficient regret. But if Moulton saw that as different from how Biden talked about the Hyde Amendment, we find those differences slight. In both cases, Biden cast his past actions as based on certain expectations or conditions that weren’t met. He had just as many caveats when talking about his shift on the Hyde Amendment as he did about his Iraq War vote. And Biden pointedly never apologized for his past stance on Hyde. Biden never voiced contrition about the vote that cleared the way to war. But overall, we find that while Moulton’s statement is partially accurate, it leaves out important details. That’s our definition of Half True. Editor's Note, June 20, 2019, 1:13 p.m.: This story replaces an earlier version that was initally published at 12:06 p.m. in error.

Joe Biden says there are tax breaks for racehorses, not child care. That’s misleading
","Joe Biden criticized the tax bill signed by President Donald Trump and said it doesn’t do enough to help working families. ""Why should you get a break for racehorses and not get a break for child care?"" Biden said in a June 11 speech in Iowa. Biden’s general point was to question why Congress has pursued tax benefits for the owners of racehorses while not giving tax breaks to parents with hefty child care expenses. Biden has floated the idea of an $8,000 tax credit for child care to encourage more women to enter the workforce. Biden may want larger tax breaks, but his statement could create the misleading impression that parents don’t get one now, and that’s not the case. The first thing to know about Biden’s statement is that there are two key credits that pertain to families with children: the child tax credit and the child and dependent care tax credit. The child tax credit is not tied to any expenses such as day care — taxpayers are eligible if they have children under the age of 17. The 2017 legislation doubled the tax credit for each child from $1,000 to $2,000. However, to get to the last $600, you have to actually owe taxes. The credit applies to more affluent families than previously, phasing out at $400,000 rather than $110,000 for joint filers. These provisions will sunset after 2025. How much of a credit it actually translates to varies depending upon income, said Elaine Maag, a researcher at the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. For low-income families, they generally get a tax cut of about $75 while higher-income people do a little better. ""For middle-income families many of them did see child tax credits double, but at the same time they lost personal exemptions for their child,"" Maag said. ""They are a little better off but not $1,000 per child better off."" The child care tax credit was not changed by the 2017 bill. Taxpayers who paid money for daycare, after school care or summer camp for a child under age 13 can get part of that money back in the form of a tax credit — but only if they owe taxes. Usually the credit applies to 20% of expenses up to $3,000 for a child. While the tax bill didn’t change the child care tax credit, it became a little less valuable due to the changes in the child tax credit. ""Unless they owe more than $600 per child in income tax, there is no tax left to offset with the child care credit — so they receive no additional benefit from the child care credit,"" Maag said. When considering all the changes in the tax bill, the Tax Policy Center found that the cuts would benefit the highest fifth of earners the most, largely due to cuts to corporate income tax, reductions in taxation of business income and the estate tax. ""Very few tax-lowering changes in the bill are targeted at families with children — and none at families with very young children,"" the Tax Policy Center wrote in November 2017 shortly before the bill passed. There were some changes in the tax bill that didn’t specifically target race horses but did help the industry. The largest change is full expensing, which lets a taxpayer who bought a racehorse (or many other long-term assets) write off that cost in the first year, unlike three years under the previous tax code, said Patrick Newton, spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. For example, under the 2017 bill, a business with $50,000 in revenues that spent spent $50,000 buying a racehorse would have zero in taxable income. Under prior law, they would have had to take the $50,000 deduction over time so they would have some taxable income. Before the 2017 tax bill, there was a separate provision in the tax code specifically about racehorses. Congress passed a 2008 farm bill that included a provision to allow racehorses to be depreciated over three years, rather than the previous seven years. This provision expired at the end of 2017 and is one of the tax extension measures that Congress keeps trying to restore, said Howard Gleckman, an expert at the Tax Policy Center. Biden said, ""Why should you get a break for racehorses and not get a break for child care?"" Biden wants a larger tax break for working parents, but his statement creates a misleading impression that none currently exists. The child care tax credit, which was not changed by the 2017 bill signed by Trump, gives a tax credit to parents who paid for day care, after school care or summer camp for a child under age 13. Usually the credit applies to 20% of expenses up to $3,000 for a child. Separately, the tax bill did increase the child tax credit. As for horses, the tax bill allows a write-off for purchasing a racehorse (among other items) in the first year. Biden’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Don Puz, who graduated from Vashon High School in 1963 and worked as a sheriff’s deputy until he retired in 1991, said that the bike was donated to him after his family’s home burned down, the Beachcomber says. It was too small for him and he claims that in 1954 he left it in the woods, forgot about it and never returned for it. His mother told the publication that her son and his friends had been playing in the woods and that Puz was the only child to ride his bike there. When the boys left, he abandoned his bike and walked home with them. After the bike was discovered and drew media attention, Puz visited the bike, the Beachcomber says. ""We went down there in the woods and there was this bike in the tree, and I said, ‘That’s my bike,’"" the Beachcomber quotes Puz as saying. ""I recognized it immediately. … When I saw that bike, I recognized it, because I don’t think I’ve ever seen another one like it."" In 2013, Seattle TV station KOMO News also talked to Puz who said he had no doubt the bike was his. ""It’s a couple hundred feet from my mom’s house where I used to play in the woods,"" he said.

Roark is expelled from architectural school early in the book and during a conversation with the school’s dean, Roark is asked about a drawing he turned in, according to the blog post.

He linked to a page on ""amoralism"" on the institute’s website.

No evidence Obama said, “If we don’t do something about this president, I will”
","A June 12 Facebook post claims that former president Barack Obama led a charge against current president Donald Trump at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser the previous evening. ""Barack Obama said, ‘If we don’t do something about this president, I will.’ at DNC fundraiser last night,"" the oddly-punctuated and curiously-worded post says. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And we couldn’t find any evidence that the post includes accurate information. The Democratic National Committee did not immediately respond to an email asking about the post. But the claim is an old one, dating back to June 2018, after Obama spoke at a DNC fundraiser in Beverly Hills, Calif., delivering what Politico then reported were his first public comments in months. ""Obama stuck to his routine of never saying President Donald Trump’s name in public, but he spoke at length about what his problems are with the Trump presidency — and why he thinks Democrats would be foolish to believe that they’re in good shape to beat him (in 2020) just because they’ve been doing well in winning recent elections,"" the June 29 article says. DNC chairman Tom Perez introduced Obama by urging the crowd to ""give it up for the real president of the United States,"" but the story includes no mention of the statement the Facebook post attributes to Obama, or anything like it. Rather, he encouraged them to vote. ""Former President Barack Obama tries to mobilize Democrats at fundraiser event,"" reads the headline of a Time article after the speech. Searching the Nexis news database for the statement in the Facebook post and Obama’s name, we found no results. We also didn’t find the statement attributed to someone else in news articles.

Do red-flag laws reduce gun suicides, as Creigh Deeds says?
","State Sen. Creigh Deeds, a leading voice for mental health reforms, is talking up a ""red- flag law"" in Virginia that would allow seizure of guns from people deemed substantial threats to themselves or others. The legislation is expected to be among several gun control bills put before the General Assembly in July special starting July 9. Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, ordered the legislature to convene in the wake of a May 31 mass shooting at the Virginia Beach Civic Center that killed 12, in addition to the shooter. Deeds, D-Bath, discussed the upcoming session during a June 10 interview on the conservative Virginia Talk Radio Network ""The so-called red-flag bill; it’s been endorsed by a commission put together by President Trump at the federal level, it’s been enacted into law in a number of states, and shown to reduce the number of suicides by firearms,"" he said. Deeds is right that a Trump commission, and the president, have endorsed red-flag laws - also called ""Extreme Risk Protection Orders."" Fifteen states have adopted the laws, and many others are considering them. What caught our ear was his claim that the laws have been ""shown to reduce the number of suicides by firearms."" We wondered if he’s right. Deeds told us he doesn’t remember the source behind his statement. ""Maybe I just heard it; I don’t know,"" he said. Background Fifteen states and the District of Columbia red-flag law, also called extreme risk laws. They allow police - and often, family members - to petition a court to order the temporary removal of firearms from a person who may be dangerous to himself or others. After a set amount of time, the weapon is either returned to the person or the court order is extended. Supporters say the laws can prevent violent crimes and suicides. Opponents say the laws allow government seizure of firearms in violation of the Second Amendment. The National Rifle Association opposed the laws for many years, but in 2018 changed position and said it would back bills if they provide due process and require mental treatment for the person temporarily forfeiting his gun. In Virginia, a red-flag bill was defeated in January by a 4-2 vote of a Republican-controlled House subcommittee that routinely defeats gun control measures. The bill would have allowed a law enforcement officer to ask a judge deem a person poses ""substantial risk of injury to himself or others,"" and order seizure of his firearms for 14 days. The judge would have had options to extend the order for 180-day periods. There hasn’t been a lot of study on the effectiveness of red-flag laws, mainly because they’re a recent trend. ""Generally, it’s too early to tell whether red-flag laws work,"" the Nebraska Legislature was told by its research office in a February 2019 report. ""The majority of red-flag laws were enacted in 2018; only two states had laws in place prior to 2014, allowing little time for extensive study."" The Nebraska Legislature decided to delay consideration of a red-flag bill until next year. Studies The two senior red-flag states are Connecticut and Indiana, which enacted laws in 1999 and 2005, respectively. The vast majority of seizures in both states have been to prevent possible suicides - 68 percent in Indiana and some years, as high as 80 percent in Connecticut. Aaron Kivisto, a psychology professor at the University of Indianapolis, published a widely-cited study in 2018 finding red-flag laws were statistically likely to have reduced gun suicides in the two states. Indiana likely saw a 7.5 fewer gun suicides from 2005-2015 than it would have without the law. Kivisto wrote that statistical analysis ""suggests"" the law may have prevented 383 firearm suicides over the 10 years and 44 non-firearm suicides might be attributed to the law. Connecticut laxly enforced its red-flag law during its first eight years and the measure likely resulted in 1.6 percent fewer gun suicides from 1999-2007, according to Kivisto. Connecticut has seen stronger results since amping its enforcement in reaction to the 2007 mass shootings at Virginia Tech that killed 32 students and faculty in addition to the gunman, who had been adjudicated mentally ill but was still bought guns. From 2007- 2015, the Connecticut likely saw 13.7 percent fewer gun suicides than it would have without the law. But the results are not a clear overall win in Connecticut, While there were fewer gun suicides than might be expected, people may have turned to other ways to kill themselves. Kivisto estimated that law prevented 128 firearms suicides and might be ""attributed"" to 140 non-gun suicides. A complication with the statistics is that the raw number of suicides - with and without guns - has increased in Connecticut, Indiana, and across the United States this century. So have suicide rates per 100,000 people. Kivisto says his analysis suggests there would even have been even more gun suicides without the red-flag law in Connecticut and Indiana. Combining his results from Connecticut and Indiana, Kivisto concluded, ""These findings suggest that firearm seizure legislation is associated with meaningful reductions in population-level forearms suicide rates, with mixed evidence for a replacement effect."" Other studies of Connecticut and Indiana have been led by Jeffrey Swanson, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University.  He statistically concluded in both states, about one life was saved for every ten guns seized. Our ruling Deeds said red-flag laws have been ""shown to reduce the number of suicides by firearms."" The scant research available, confined to two states, backs Deeds. Duke studies have concluded that one life was saved for every 10 firearms seized in Connecticut and Indiana. A University of Indianapolis study found it statistically likely that the two states would have experienced more gun suicides if they didn’t have the law. But Deeds’ claim could use some clarification. The number and rate of suicides - by gun or other means - have increased in both states and across the nation this century. What the studies conclude is that it would have been even worse in Connecticut and Indiana without the law. Another issue: While Connecticut had fewer gun suicides because of the law, the University of Indianapolis suggests the law caused a more than corresponding increase in suicides by other methods. Because Deed’s statement needs elaboration, we rate it Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2019/jun/19/creigh-deeds/do-red-flag-laws-reduce-gun-suicides-creigh-deeds-/

Gavin Newsom makes False claim of raising LGBTQ Pride flag ‘for first time’ at California’s Capitol
","Gov. Gavin Newsom claimed his administration raised the rainbow flag, a symbol of LGBTQ pride, at the state Capitol ""for the first time in our state’s history"" this week. But a front page newspaper photo and article from 1990 show otherwise. To clear this up, we set out on a fact check. Our research The San Francisco-based Bay Area Reporter, which serves the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender communities, published the article on October 18, 1990. It shows the rainbow Pride flag flying over the Capitol on National Coming Out Day, on the main pole below the national and state flags, one week earlier, on October. 11, 1990 .  The October 18, 1990 issue of the Bay Area Reporter featured a photo of the Pride flag that flew briefly at the state Capitol on October 11 for National Coming Out Day. Photo Courtesy: Bay Area Reporter archives. ""The flag ended up being flown for only a few hours that day,"" an article in the Reporter reads this week. It cites its own report from three decades ago: ""Then-governor George Deukmejian ordered the flag to be taken down shortly after it was raised."" The article states that police received threats from veterans who said they planned to shoot or burn the flag. The Pride flag that was raised in 1990 wasn’t a stunt. It was sanctioned by the Joint Rules Committee of the California Senate and Assembly, and was the result of work by LGBT state Senate staffers and activists. ""We followed all protocols,"" Ken Topper, who worked at the time for then-state Senate Leader David Roberti, told PolitiFact California. ""It wasn’t an easy thing to do,"" added Michael Bosia, who also worked in the state Senate at the time and is now a political science professor at Saint Michael’s College in Vermont. ""It was something that was really powerful and evocative and hopeful."" The Reporter announced in an article one week before the raising that the Rules committee approved the decision.  Former California state Senate staffer Ken Topper helped win approval to raise a Pride flag at the Capitol in 1990 / Photos courtesy of Ken Topper Newsom’s response In a written statement, Newsom said he had been unaware of the 1990 episode. ""While this is the first time the LGBTQ Pride flag has been flown above the Capitol to commemorate June as LGBTQ pride month, I have learned that there were three hours in 1990 where the flag flew there previously. This piece of our state’s history deserves to be called out and recognized.  News reports from the time tell of a group of activists and legislators who quietly orchestrated the flag to be flown to commemorate National Coming Out Day. It was an act of visibility and defiance. After a short time on display, Governor Deukmejian was alerted to the flag’s existence and ordered it to come down, telling media it was ""mistakenly"" raised.""   Earlier this month, U.S. embassies were denied permission by the Trump administration to fly the rainbow flag in honor of the LGBTQ Pride Month, according to CNN. Support for flying the flag is far greater in California. Newsom said he fully supported the effort, in contrast to Deukmejian three decades ago. ""In California, we celebrate and support our lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community’s right to live out loud — during Pride month and every month,"" Newsom said in a news release. ""By flying the pride flag over the State Capitol, we send a clear message that California is welcoming and inclusive to all, regardless of how you identify or who you love."" The news release acknowledged this isn’t the first time the rainbow flag has appeared at the Capitol. ""The flag has previously been hung over balconies both inside and outside of the building and the Capitol dome was illuminated in rainbow colors in June 2015,"" it read. Newsom said the rainbow flag will fly atop the Capitol through July 1. Our rating Newsom claimed his administration raised the rainbow flag at the state Capitol ""for the first time in our state’s history"" this week. A newspaper photo and article from 1990 show the flag flew atop the Capitol three decades ago, for a few hours. Two former state Senate staffers told us a joint Senate and Assembly committee authorized the move. Newsom was wrong about this being the ""first time in our state’s history"" that the flag flew atop the Capitol. The raising in 1990 went through protocols, was sanctioned and announced ahead of time in a Bay Area newspaper.

Attack on Trump-backed Mo Brooks distorts his votes on ISIS
","The Republican endorsed by former President Donald Trump for an open U.S. Senate seat in Alabama tried to undercut the U.S. fight against the ISIS terrorist organization, according to one TV ad attacking him.  U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks faces two other major GOP challengers in the May 24 primary and is being attacked in TV, radio and Facebook ads from Alabama’s Future, a super PAC formed to oppose his candidacy.  In the ad, a narrator said Brooks voted ""to cut off funding to destroy ISIS terrorists — in the middle of the fight."" Small text appearing in the ad alludes to Brooks’ votes for two failed proposals that had more to do with congressional authorization of military action against ISIS than cutting off funding for such action. They pertained to two amendments to Defense Department appropriations bills. National security expert John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org said the amendments ""had nothing to do with blowing up ISIS and had everything to do with a congressional assertion of having a role in the war powers.""  ISIS, also known as the Islamic State, seized control of territory in Syria and Iraq starting in 2014, the year the campaign to defeat the Islamic militant group took shape. One of Brooks’ votes regarding ISIS occurred in 2015 and the other in 2016, as major U.S. military operations were carried out. It wasn’t until mid-2017 that ISIS, after losing much of the territory it had seized, collapsed. So, it’s fair to say that the two Brooks votes occurred during, as the ad claimed, ""the middle of the fight,"" according to Pike and national security expert Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, who oversees Valens Global, a private national security consulting firm. But both said the ad’s claim against Brooks is oversimplified. Alabama’s Future has spent $2.89 million in the 2021-22 election cycle, according to the nonprofit Open Secrets. It’s not clear who organized the group, which does not disclose its donors to the Federal Election Commission. Alabama’s Future did not respond to our requests for information about the claim in the ad we’re checking. But the ad — along with another version of the TV ad we’re checking,  two radio ads and a Facebook ad — identifies the two Brooks votes.  In both cases, Brooks voted in favor of an amendment to annual appropriations bills for the Defense Department. Neither amendment passed. On June 11, 2015, the House voted on an amendment to the 2016 appropriations bill. The amendment would have prohibited the use of funds for Operation Inherent Resolve, as the campaign to defeat ISIS was known, without Congress first enacting a law authorizing the use of military force against ISIS. The amendment failed on a vote of 231-196. Brooks was one of 33 Republicans to vote yes, along with 163 Democrats, including Pelosi, the House speaker. The other six Alabama House members, including the lone Democrat, Terri Sewell, voted no.  The amendment’s sponsor, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said at the time that he wanted no money spent ""for the war against ISIS after a certain date in March of next year unless Congress authorizes a war against ISIS."" The second vote came on June 16, 2016, when the House voted on an amendment to the 2017 appropriations bill. The amendment would have prohibited funds being obligated for combat operations in Iraq or Syria unless an authorization for the use of military force, known as an AUMF, had been enacted.  That amendment was proposed by Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass. He said at the time: ""Quite simply, if you want the money to fight a war, then pass an AUMF."" The amendment failed on a vote of 285-130. Brooks was one of 17 Republicans to vote for the amendment, along with 118 Democrats, including Pelosi. Again, the other Alabama House members voted no. Gartenstein-Ross said that had either amendment become law, the funding for the fight against ISIS would have come to an end — but in that case, Congress could simply have taken the separate step of authorizing such military action. ""It’s highly likely"" that Congress would have approved an authorization for the use of military force, he said. A key aim of the amendments was to give Congress authority over the military actions that had been originally authorized after the 9/11 terrorist attacks some 15 years earlier, Gartenstein-Ross said. That’s significant because that military force authorization specifically targeted organizations and persons who ""planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001,"" and by the time Brooks’ amendment votes were taken, ISIS had split from al-Qaida, the terrorist group responsible for the 9/11 attacks, Gartenstein-Ross said. Michael O'Hanlon, director of research in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, said some House members would only have supported funding for the war against ISIS if there were first congressional authorization. But some members voting for the amendments were simply trying to restore stronger congressional oversight on the use of force by the United States, he said. Brooks’ campaign noted that Brooks voted for the two appropriations bills themselves.  In February 2015, Brooks raised questions about how spending money on fighting ISIS would affect other defense priorities and whether other nations would help the U.S. combat ISIS. And in June 2015, Brooks said an authorization of force proposed by President Barack Obama was ""weak"" because it was vague and had a three-year time limit.  ""If we’re going to get in there, the president needs to have whatever authorization he needs to win and I’ll vote for that kind of authorization for use of military force,"" Brooks said. ""But I’m not going to vote for one that replicates the problems and loss of lives associated with Vietnam, where we don’t get in there to win, where we hamstring ourselves.""  Brooks has faced criticism for the votes before. A 2017 ad made a similar attack on Brooks, claiming he ""voted to cut off funding to fight ISIS."" A Birmingham TV station’s fact-check called the claim ""true but misleading.""  The Alabama race is to succeed Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, who was first elected to the Senate in 1986 and is not seeking re-election.  The outcome could help determine which party controls the Senate, now split 50-50. Since campaign watchers rate the race as safe or solid Republican, the outcome of the May 24 primary is key.  The other major GOP candidates are former Shelby aide Katie Britt and Army veteran Mike Durant. If no candidate receives a majority of the votes, a primary runoff election for the top two finishers would be held June 21. Alabama’s Future claimed in an ad that Brooks ""voted to cut off funding to destroy ISIS terrorists in the middle of the fight."" The ad alludes to two votes, one in 2015 and one in 2016 during U.S. combat operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Neither was an up-or-down vote on funding military operations against the terrorist group. What Brooks voted for were measures that would have required congressional authorization of military action against ISIS before any funding of such operations could be approved. The ad contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

Tenn. Sen. Marsha Blackburn wrong about Ketanji Brown Jackson and critical race theory
","A Republican senator claimed that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson said judges should use critical race theory in making their decisions. Jackson would be the first Black woman on the U.S. Supreme Court if confirmed by the Senate.  Critical race theory is a collection of ideas about systemic bias and privilege. Conservative elected officials have moved to bar critical race theory in public schools or state agencies, even when it isn’t being used. The attack on Jackson, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, came from Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn. In a Fox News interview during a break on the second day of Jackson’s Senate confirmation hearings, Blackburn said Tennessee residents have concerns about Jackson and parental rights. ""Whether you're in Virginia, whether you're in San Francisco, you want children to be taught facts in school, you don't want them indoctrinated. They're concerned about Judge Jackson,"" Blackburn said March 22.  In 2015, she continued, Jackson ""gave a lecture talking about critical race theory as one of the components to consider when you are making decisions on the bench."" Blackburn is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will recommend whether Jackson’s nomination by President Joe Biden should be considered by the full Senate. Her claim was similar to a narrower remark she made on the first day of the hearings, when she told Jackson that ""you believe judges must consider critical race theory when deciding criminal defendants."" Blackburn’s office cited a 2015 Jackson lecture on federal criminal sentencing policy. In the text of the speech, which is part of a record on Jackson assembled by the committee, Jackson said: ""… no fewer than 97% of the cases in the federal criminal justice system are now resolved by guilty pleas, so in the vast majority of criminal cases, sentencing is really all there is. But even beyond that, learning about sentencing is important for all lawyers, even if criminal law is not your thing, because, at bottom, the sentencing of criminal offenders is the authorized exercise of the power of the government to subjugate the free will of individuals … ""I also try to convince my students that sentencing is just plain interesting on an intellectual level, in part because it melds together myriad types of law — criminal law, of course, but also administrative law, constitutional law, critical race theory, negotiations and, to some extent, even contracts. And if that’s not enough to prove to them that sentencing is a subject worth studying, I point out that sentencing policy implicates and intersects with various other intellectual disciplines as well, including philosophy, psychology, history, statistics, economics, and politics."" Republicans have questioned whether critical race theory influences Jackson’s views and work, including with a statement by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Besides Jackson’s 2015 speech, the statement said that in a 2020 lecture, Jackson said a book on racism by Derrick Bell, who is seen as a leader of critical race theory, was an influential book to her. Prior to her nomination to the D.C. Circuit judgeship, Jackson served for eight years as a federal district court judge, having been appointed by President Barack Obama. She has also served as vice chair and commissioner on the U.S. Sentencing Commission.  Jackson, having worked as a federal public defender, would be the first Supreme Court justice with extensive criminal defense experience since the late Thurgood Marshall. Blackburn claimed that Jackson in 2015 ""gave a lecture talking about critical race theory as one of the components to consider when you are making decisions on the bench."" Jackson was speaking about sentencing policy, not how judges make decisions on the bench. She said sentencing policy is interesting on an intellectual level because it ""melds together myriad types of law,"" as well as critical race theory, negotiations and contracts.

Marsha Blackburn misleads about Jackson’s record on releasing criminals during the pandemic
","Republicans have portrayed Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson as soft on criminals. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., suggested the federal judge ""consistently called for greater freedom for hardened criminals."" During the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing March 21, Blackburn said to Jackson, ""At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, you advocated and again I quote for ‘each and every criminal defendant in D.C. Corrections custody should be released.’ That would have been 1,500 criminals back on the street if you had had your way.""  Blackburn’s statement creates an impression that Jackson advocated for releasing incarcerated defendants en masse, and that’s wrong. The senator also cherry-picks part of Jackson’s April 10, 2020, ruling in one case in which she actually denied an inmate’s request for release. We contacted Blackburn’s office to ask for her evidence about President Joe Biden’s Supreme Court nominee and did not get a response by our deadline. The case at hand was a motion by a defendant, Sean Ray Wiggins, who sought to be released from the D.C. jail to home confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of Jackson’s ruling in April 2020, 41 inmates had tested positive for COVID-19 in the jail. Jackson was a U.S. District Court judge in Washington, D.C. Prosecutors opposed Wiggins’ request for release, arguing he was a danger to the community. Wiggins had pleaded guilty to participating in a large heroin trafficking conspiracy, and law enforcement found a significant amount of ammunition at his home when they arrested him. Jackson did make the statement that Blackburn quotes about releasing defendants: ""The obvious increased risk of harm that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to individuals who have been detained in the District's correctional facilities reasonably suggests that each and every criminal defendant who is currently in D.C. DOC custody — and who thus cannot take independent measures to control their own hygiene and distance themselves from others — should be released,"" Jackson wrote.  But Blackburn omits that Jackson also wrote that there are constraints on judicial authority and that statutes mandate an assessment of an inmate’s flight risk and dangerousness and that releasing dangerous defendants ""poses substantial risks to probation officers, law enforcement, and the public at large."" She concluded that Wiggins had not met the conditions for release and denied his motions. The Congressional Research Service wrote that many of Jackson’s decisions about releasing defendants during the pandemic ""did not rely on it to grant release automatically"" and that her decisions reflect ""attention to case-specific circumstances.""  The report cites multiple examples of when Jackson denied motions for release: Hartley James Lee, who was charged with possession of firearms. Jackson wrote that she agreed with recent precedents that ""rejected emergency motions for release of otherwise healthy and potentially violent defendants based solely on the generalized risks that COVID-19 admittedly creates for all members of our society."" Jackson cited a ruling by a magistrate judge who concluded that Lee was not likely to comply with release conditions and that he may act violently if released. Robert Leake, a defendant charged with drug and gun offenses, which Jackson described as ""serious and dangerous."" Jackson said that while Leake had mild asthma, he had a history of noncompliance with conditions of release, so there wasn’t a compelling reason for his release.  ​​Jeremy Sears, pleaded guilty to distribution of child pornography. He sought release due to conditions including diabetes and asthma. Jackson wrote that Sears was at high risk of reoffending without treatment and had not had any sex offender treatment while in custody. In at least two decisions in 2020, the Congressional Research Service found, Jackson granted release to federal offenders based in part on the pandemic after examining factors specific to each offender: D’Angelo Dunlap, an inmate who had serious underlying medical conditions including a heart abnormality. Dunlap, a heroin addict, pleaded guilty to two counts of bank robbery. Jackson wrote that Dunlap ""did not have a weapon and did not specifically threaten violence"" and that he didn’t pose a danger to anyone but himself. She ordered him released, with the first six months of his 36-month term of supervised release under home incarceration. Morris Gemal Johnson, who was convicted of weapons-related offenses. Johnson was an honorably discharged veteran with no prior criminal history who completed two tours in Afghanistan and had since been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Johnson had generally complied with release conditions for the 3.5 years it took to bring his case to trial.  In a case unrelated to the pandemic, Jackson granted release to a 72-year-old prisoner who had served 49 years in prison and had medical conditions. LaVance Greene in 1971 fatally shot a marshal as Greene assisted his half brother from escaping custody during a funeral furlough. Greene, 23 at the time, was found guilty of felony murder and armed robbery. Prison officers supported his request for release and said he was a model inmate.  Blackburn said that at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Jackson advocated that ""each and every criminal defendant in D.C. Corrections custody should be released.""  Blackburn plucked out part of a statement by Jackson in an April 2020 ruling while omitting that the judge also wrote that statutes mandate assessment of an inmate’s flight risk and the danger they pose. Jackson concluded that the inmate had not met the conditions for release and denied his motion.  Blackburn’s statement suggests that Jackson released all inmates who came before her en masse, and that’s wrong. Jackson denied some inmates’ requests for release and granted other ones, taking into account factors such as the likelihood they would reoffend and whether they would comply with conditions of release.  We rate this statement Mostly False.  RELATED: Joe Biden keeps promise to name first Black woman to Supreme Court",/factchecks/2022/mar/22/marsha-blackburn/marsha-blackburn-misleads-about-jacksons-record-re/

One America News runs conspiratorial segment claiming strike on Mariupol hospital was US false flag
","On March 9, Russia blasted a maternity hospital in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol.  Fatalities from the airstrike included a pale, bloodied pregnant woman who was photographed as she was carried from the hospital on a stretcher. Her baby died with her, the Associated Press reported. The attack left a crater in the ground, cars in flames and facilities damaged.  Ukrainian officials said at least 17 people were injured, and at least five have died since the attack, according to CNN.   Ukrainian emergency employees and volunteers carry an injured pregnant woman from a maternity hospital that was damaged by shelling in Mariupol, Ukraine, on March 9, 2022. (AP) ""A strike on a maternity hospital is a final proof, proof of a genocide of Ukrainians taking place,"" Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said after the attack. Russian officials, meanwhile, teetered between denial, justification and disinformation. They asserted that the hospital was empty and being used as a base for armed forces, and they falsely claimed that certain pregnant victims were crisis actors. Those and other claims casting doubt on the Mariupol hospital attack found a home on the far-right U.S. channel One America News Network. In a March 11 segment, OAN host Pearson Sharp baselessly suggested that the airstrike was a U.S.-led ""false flag."" ""The United States has a long, storied history of conducting false flag operations in pursuit of its own political agenda,"" Sharp said, citing U.S. allegations of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and unspecified ""false flag gas attacks"" that he claimed the U.S. orchestrated in Syria. Sharp continued: ""It looks like we have the makings of yet another false flag operation, this time in the far-flung land of Ukraine, where Biden and his cronies are desperately trying to cook up more conflict to distract from their monumental failures here in America …"" The OAN host went on to claim that the hospital had ""no patients inside."" U.S. Defense Department spokesperson Eric Pahon told PolitiFact that Sharp’s claims are ""ridiculous."" Several independent experts characterized Sharp’s ""false flag"" allegation in the same way.  ""There is no evidence the United States has been militarily engaged in any element of the conflict in Ukraine, let alone the bombing of a hospital in Mariupol,"" said Graham Brookie, the senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. ""There is no legitimate reason that the United States would make worse a war that it has publicly denounced and is actively engaged in trying to end with every lever at its disposal."" In an email to PolitiFact, OAN’s Sharp said that other stories of questionable veracity have come out of Ukraine, such as the heroic yet unverified tale of the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" fighter pilot. He also pointed to another time in the segment where he hedged slightly, saying, ""We’re not saying we know what happened here, or that this was a false flag."" ""All I’m saying in my report is that we have a journalistic duty to question what we’re told, rather than straightaway accept it as fact,"" Sharp told PolitiFact. ""Everyone is ignoring the whole point."" Governments have plotted some false flags throughout history, albeit sparingly. But Sharp went beyond merely questioning what Ukrainian and international officials have said. ""As usual, OAN does not provide any evidence for their claim,"" said Scott Radnitz, director of the Ellison Center for Russian, East European and Central Asian Studies at the University of Washington. ""This war is one of the best-covered ever, considering the wide availability of smartphones. The bombing of the hospital in Mariupol had multiple eyewitnesses and its aftermath was caught on camera."" Journalists from the Associated Press, who were the last reporters left in Mariupol before getting out as Russia besieged the city, shot photos and video of the wreckage.   Smoke rises after shelling in Mariupol, Ukraine, on March 9, 2022. (AP) ""We watched smoke rise from a maternity hospital,"" they reported. ""When we arrived, emergency workers were still pulling bloodied pregnant women from the ruins."" A pregnant woman who later gave birth to a baby girl was photographed at the scene and gave the AP her eyewitness account: ""We were lying in wards when glass, frames, windows and walls flew apart … We don’t know how it happened. We were in our wards and some had time to cover themselves, some didn’t.""  Mariana Vishegirskaya stands outside a maternity hospital that was damaged by shelling in Mariupol, Ukraine, on March 9, 2022. (AP) Additional footage was posted to Telegram, including by Zelensky and the city council in Mariupol. Several news organizations also verified videos from the hospital.  A U.N. spokesperson laid the blame on Russia in a press briefing March 11. By claiming without evidence that the hospital had been a base for Ukrainian military activity, the Russian Foreign Ministry effectively admitted to the attack, Brookie said. Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow and the director of research in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, said it wouldn’t make sense for the U.S. to gin up a false flag as Sharp alleged.  ""Biden and team are trying to keep us out of this war,"" O’Hanlon said. ""So concocting stories of atrocities would serve little purpose and might even be counterproductive."" But Sharp’s segment would have been welcomed by Russian officials seeking to avoid blame, and by Russian state media, where such false narratives regularly get amplified, experts said. ""Wars always involve propaganda, and aggressors benefit when their actions that might incur global condemnation are obscured or blamed on the other side,"" Radnitz said. ""OAN, whether deliberately or inadvertently, assists Russia in this effort."" Sharp said the attack on the Mariupol hospital had ""the makings of yet another false flag operation"" by the U.S. There is no evidence that the attack was staged or a false flag carried out by the U.S. Its aftermath was documented by workers, witnesses and journalists on the ground.

The Biden administration is trying to buy less lithium from China, not more
","In late February, President Joe Biden met with a group of California business and government leaders to highlight new domestic efforts to mine lithium and other materials to help power electric cars and wind turbines.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The White House isn’t trying to buy more lithium from China for electric vehicles; it’s trying to buy less. Biden’s Feb. 22 meeting was about the U.S. trying to distance itself from purchasing foreign materials like lithium — particularly from China — by mining more domestically. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. In the virtual meeting, the president announced several investments aimed at expanding domestic supply of lithium, cobalt and other materials that are used to make electric vehicles, computers, solar panels and wind turbines. The U.S. currently gets many of these materials from China. According to the 2021 BP Statistical Review, China has 7.9% of the world’s lithium reserves. The U.S. has 4.0%. While the majority of reserves are in South America and Australia, China has become the third largest lithium producer in the world, spending over $60 billion over the past decade to build up the industry. To shore up production at home, Biden announced that his administration is giving $35 million to American mining company MP Materials to expand a project in Mountain Pass, California. The money will strengthen MP’s ability to process rare earth materials domestically for U.S. manufacturing. The initiative is part of an effort to make the U.S. less dependent on foreign products amid the supply chain disruptions that have helped fuel inflation. MP is expected to invest another $700 million in the supply chain by 2024. ""We can’t build a future that’s made in America if we ourselves are dependent on China for the materials that power the products of today and tomorrow,"" Biden said Feb. 22. ""And this is not anti-China, or anti-anything else. It’s pro-America."" Biden also discussed efforts to extract lithium from around California’s Salton Sea and estimated that U.S. demand for the material will increase by 400% to 600% over the next several decades. A Facebook post claims that Biden wants to buy lithium from China for electric cars.

Claim that Evers brought Republicans and Democrats together on tax cut doesn’t tell full story
","Wisconsin Republicans and Democrats both want credit for a massive tax cut signed into state law last summer.  In a sign of the times, the two parties can’t agree on whether the move — part of the Republican-written state budget that Democratic Gov. Tony Evers signed into law — was a bipartisan one or not.  Republican leadership said no. Evers said yes. The Wisconsin Initiative, a group whose website says it works to enact progressive policies, hold elected officials accountable and find solutions to issues facing the state’s working families, says yes, too.   A pro-Evers television ad from the group says the move would help working families with rising costs and declared that Evers ""brought Republicans and Democrats together to cut income taxes for the middle class.""  But that doesn’t exactly describe what happened.  Let’s take a look.  How the tax cut plan unfolded When Evers released his two-year spending plan for the state Feb. 16, 2021, it included a net increase of $1 billion in taxes over the biennium. He aimed to give tax breaks to the lower and middle classes and raise taxes on businesses and the wealthy.  Republicans didn’t care for it. They removed his tax increases and breaks and, after learning the state would receive more than $4 billion extra in tax collections over the next three years, proposed a plan to cut more than $2 billion in taxes in their own budget.  That included lowering one tax bracket from 6.27% to 5.3%, covering incomes up to $263,000 for individuals and up to $351,000 for married couples. The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimated at the time that about three-quarters of the cuts would go to those making $100,000 or more a year.  When Evers signed that budget, he cheered the tax cut and said it delivered on his promise to cut taxes for middle-class families.  Republicans didn’t like that, either.  ""Governor Tony Evers deserves NO credit for signing our budget,"" Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, said in a statement at the time, arguing it was not a bipartisan victory but rather that Evers was ""boxed into a corner."" Evers said his signature on the Republican-written budget by nature made it a bipartisan effort. ""I signed the budget — simple as that. I could have vetoed that,"" he said at the time.  Evers signed the budget, but the tax cut plan was written by Republicans When reached by PolitiFact Wisconsin, Morgan Grunow, executive director of the Wisconsin Initiative, pointed to bipartisan support as the Republicans’ budget moved through the Legislature as well as Evers’ final signature.  When it passed the state Assembly on June 29, 2021, four Democrats joined Republicans in supporting it. Three Democrats in the state Senate voted for the plan the next day before sending it to Evers’ desk.  ""At the end of the day, Governor Evers introduced the budget, Democrats and Republicans both voted for it, and Evers signed into law,"" Grunow wrote in an email. ""Bipartisan agreement on anything, especially this day and age, seems to align with the idea of bringing people together. The final vote tally speaks for itself."" It’s correct that Evers has long pushed for middle-class tax cuts. He campaigned on cutting state income taxes by 10% for Wisconsinites making $100,000 a year or less. (PolitiFact Wisconsin rated that campaign promise as a Compromise last July because he’d pledged to do so in his first budget, not his second.) But it was the Republican-written budget, not his own, that eventually accomplished that goal for him.  And while the budget that was ultimately signed into law received bipartisan support in both legislative chambers, Evers didn’t personally spur those Democratic lawmakers to join with their Republican colleagues.  His actions didn’t necessarily bring people together — the pieces unfolded on their own.  The Wisconsin Initiative claimed Evers ""brought Republicans and Democrats together to cut income taxes for the middle class."" The end result of the maneuvering was that both sides — Evers and Legislative Republicans — signed off on tax cuts. But it was more the result of political maneuvering and budgetary good fortune than bipartisan outreach on the part of Evers. Our definition of Half True is a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.  That fits here.

A single-day gasoline boycott isn’t a silver bullet solution to rising gas prices
","In the wake of rising gas prices amid Russia’s attacks on Ukraine, social media users have revived a more than 10-year-old myth about a surefire way to drive down costs at the pump.  ""In April 1997, there was a ‘gas out’ conducted nationwide in protest of gas prices,"" or so the long-repeated story goes. ""Gasoline prices dropped 30 cents a gallon overnight."" Facing higher gas prices than Americans have seen in years, some posts, such as this one from March 17, shared a call to action: ""Don’t pump gas on April 15, 2022!""  ""If running low, just get your gas the day before on April 14 or the day after on April 16,"" it said. ""Every little bit helps."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

Other news outlets also debunked the story in 2007, 2011 and 2019.  (Screenshot from Facebook.) In 2012, Patrick DeHaan, a senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy.com, told PolitiFact there’s no evidence to support the idea that a boycott drove gas prices down in 1997 and called the claim ""an outright myth."" We reviewed online news archives and found no evidence of a successful gasoline boycott in 1997. There were mentions of later gasoline boycotts — including one promoted by email chains in 1999 — but, in the end, the prices of gas ""had no major fluctuations,"" at the time of said boycotts, PolitiFact reported. In April 1997, the average national price of a gallon of gasoline varied only slightly, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. Prices were as follows:  $1.203 for the week ending April 7  $1.199 for the week ending April 14  $1.199 for the week ending April 21  And $1.195 for the week ending April 28. There was no indication from the weekly average prices that a boycott had dropped the price of gas by 30 cents overnight at any point during the month. ""Depending on ongoing market events at the time, the impact on demand could cause pump prices to decline,"" said Devin Gladden, a spokesperson for AAA. ""However, a one-day event is likely to have a limited impact since longer-term trends could still cause prices to continue moving along that set direction."" It takes time for gas prices to respond to changes in oil prices, and oil prices are influenced by changes in supply and demand. Boycotting the purchase of gasoline for a single day is unlikely to have a significant impact. As both DeHaan and others noted, it has the effect of simply shifting sales from one day to another. A post claimed there was a ‘gas out’ conducted nationwide in protest of gas prices. Gasoline prices dropped 30 cents a gallon overnight."" PolitiFact found no evidence to suggest that this boycott happened, and the experts we consulted in 2022 and 2012 knew of no such protest in 1997. It often takes time for gas prices to respond to changes in demand, so it is unlikely a single-day boycott would drive down prices as quickly and drastically as the post suggests, experts said.

There is no evidence that Putin invaded Ukraine to fight child trafficking
","According to one narrative being shared on social media, Russia has a noble aim for its war against Ukraine: to end child trafficking there. ""Putin vows to ‘crush’ child traffickers in Ukraine,"" read what looked like a headline in a screenshot shared March 2 on Facebook. The headline came from Real Raw News, an outlet known for sharing misinformation, including a similar claim on Ukraine that PolitiFact rated False. ""Putin is wanting to destroy the bio labs and confront many other crimes against humanity such as child sex trafficking,"" read another post from Feb. 25, referencing a separate debunked claim that Ukraine has U.S.-funded bioweapons labs. ""Putin is cleaning up our mess,"" said another lengthy and grammatically problematic post from Feb. 27. Ukraine is where ""all the child trafficking and heroin money is washed,"" the post said.  These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence that Putin’s decision to wage war in Ukraine has been motivated by a desire to rid the country of child trafficking. And although they don’t mention QAnon, these claims echo ideas central to the conspiracy theory, experts told us. QAnon has as one of its assumptions that the world is run by a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles that include famous Democrats and celebrities. Putin did not mention child trafficking in speeches or public meetings in the months leading up to the invasion, according to transcripts published by the Kremlin and reviewed by PolitiFact.  In one of those events, Putin claimed that ethnic Russians living in areas of Ukraine controlled by Russian separatists ""have been literally tortured by constant shelling and blockades"" and that they were ""forced to seek shelter in their basements — where they now live with their children."" Putin’s stated goal for the war has been to protect ethnic Russians against ""humiliation and genocide"" perpetrated by Ukraine and to ""demilitarize and denazify"" the country, according to a speech he gave on Feb. 24. PolitiFact rated Putin’s claim of genocide False. The Real Raw News article said that its information came from an anonymous source at Mar-a-Lago with knowledge of multiple phone calls between Putin and Trump. But Real Raw News is known for fabricating sources, stories, headlines and even bylines. The Kremlin’s transcripts of Putin’s conversations, meanwhile, reveal no such correspondence. It would make little sense for Russia to attempt to ""crush"" child trafficking in Ukraine, as it has a more serious problem with human trafficking than its neighbor, according to the State Department’s latest Trafficking in Persons report. Both countries struggle with the issue, but Ukraine acted to solve it between 2020 and 2021, while Russia failed to make ""significant efforts"" to eliminate the problem, the report said. While Ukraine convicted traffickers, increased financial assistance to victims, and launched awareness campaigns, Russia ""convicted only one trafficker,"" ""did not initiate any new prosecutions of suspected traffickers,"" and ""offered no funding or programs to provide services for trafficking victims,"" the report said. Some recent Facebook posts explicitly made the connection between Ukraine and QAnon beliefs. ""Ukraine was the epicenter of the cabal's satanic operations,"" said a Twitter post shared on Facebook as a screenshot but since deleted. ""We will find that many of these ‘labs’ & underground bunkers in Ukraine hosted a lot of the cabals workings."" Travis View, an expert on QAnon and co-host of the podcast QAnon Anonymous, said the pattern of these claims fits with past QAnon activity: ""QAnon followers typically incorporate current events into their conspiracy theories, and the developments in Ukraine are no different."" Jared Holt, a researcher who studies disinformation for the Atlantic Council think tank, said QAnon’s support for Putin is partly explained by followers’ support for Trump. The former American president has praised Putin publicly, including lauding his strategy in Ukraine in the early days of the conflict.  Another element at play is QAnon’s antagonism towards the traditional media and its vulnerability to disinformation from Russia, according to View and Holt. ""Putin represents a figure akin to Trump,"" Holt said, in that they are both unfairly portrayed as a villain by corrupt authorities. In their eyes, Holt said, ""Putin is fighting against a corrupt, Satanic cabal that has captured the Western world.""  A post on Facebook alleged that Russia started its invasion of Ukraine to fight child trafficking. The claim originates in an article published by a website known for fabricating stories and sources.  There is no evidence that ending child trafficking is a goal of the war in Ukraine. Russia itself is failing to deal with human trafficking within its own borders, according to a report by the U.S. State Department.  And while Putin has been very descriptive about his reasons for invading Ukraine, child trafficking has never been mentioned.

Viral image of helicopter lifting tractor does not show NATO ‘resupplying Ukrainian farmers’
","An old photo of an Indian Air Force helicopter hauling a tractor has been recontextualized online amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Thousands of Facebook users are sharing a post that falsely claims the image shows NATO assistance in Ukraine. The widespread image, shared March 10 on Facebook and with at least 29,000 likes, is the latest in the flurry of out-of-context photos and videos that have gone viral since the start of the war. ""NATO resupplying Ukrainian farmers (with) anti-tank supplies,"" the Facebook post says.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The picture in the post dates back to at least 2020. PolitiFact found an earlier version of the same photo via reverse image searching. Mahindra Tractors, an Indian tractor manufacturer, posted it on Twitter in November 2020. It then appeared in some articles online. ""A ‘Tough’ flight which only Mahindra Tractor can dare dream of @ 11,000 ft,"" the company wrote in the Nov. 2, 2020, tweet.  Mahindra Group, the company’s parent conglomerate with headquarters in India, did not immediately respond to PolitiFact’s inquiry asking where and when the photo was snapped and what it showed. We did not immediately hear back from NATO, either.  But it is clear that the photo predates Russia’s 2022 assault on Ukraine and does not show NATO airlifting anti-tank supplies to farmers in the country, as the viral Facebook post claimed. The chopper in the 2020 photo is labeled, ""Indian Air Force."" India is not a member of NATO.

Tulsi Gabbard falsely claims U.S. ‘not so different’ from Russia on freedom of speech
","Speaking on Fox News amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard falsely claimed that Russia and the U.S. are largely the same when it comes to the suppression of free speech. The March 15 claim by Gabbard, a former congresswoman from Hawaii, came shortly after Russia arrested a journalist who protested the war on state TV and enacted a law threatening up to 15 years of prison time for spreading ""false information"" about the Ukraine invasion. Fox News host Jesse Watters teed up Gabbard’s segment by playing a clip from ABC’s ""The View,"" when a host suggested that Gabbard and Fox News host Tucker Carlson should be federally investigated for ""shilling"" for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Watters then claimed Democrats are ""seeking out ways to silence free speech.""  ""Tulsi, it is striking when you see Putin propaganda and you line it up against Biden propaganda,"" he said. ""Do you think that we’re at risk of kind of moving in that direction right now?""  Gabbard responded that the U.S. is ""moving in that direction,"" claiming its leaders and media are ""afraid of even a single voice coming out as challenging the power elite."" She continued:  ""This is why we’re seeing not only still most of the mainstream media very vigorously defending and pushing the Biden propaganda … It’s not enough that they also have Google and Big Tech basically working for them and with them to control what information we see and what information we don’t see …  ""This is what’s so dangerous about the place that we’re in right now as a country, where this idea, this principle, this foundation of freedom of speech, freedom of expression is directly under threat and under attack. And you’re right, it’s not so different. What’s happening here is not so different from what we’re seeing happening in Russia, where you’ve got state TV and controlled messaging across the board. This is where we’re at."" Five experts told PolitiFact that Gabbard is wrong. The claim is ""absurd,"" said Scott Gehlbach, a professor of political science and an expert on Russia and Ukraine at the University of Chicago.  ""In Russia, one can now face up to 15 years in prison for simply calling a war a war,"" Gehlbach said. ""In the U.S., citizens such as Tulsi Gabbard are free to make not only truthful but untruthful statements without fear of legal sanction."" Russia has long trampled its independent press and citizens’ freedom of speech.  Opposition leader Alexei Navalny, a prominent Putin critic, was arrested in 2021 and recently added to the country’s registry of terrorists and extremists. The Kremlin’s restrictions, tightened further since its invasion of Ukraine, have driven citizens to use virtual private networks and encrypted servers to access factual information.  ""The state in Russia is criminalizing speech and locking people up,"" said Rutgers Law School professor Ellen Goodman, the co-director of the university’s Institute for Information Policy and Law. ""That is not happening in the U.S. — not at (the) hands of private parties or state.""  Russia shuttered its main independent broadcasters and cut access to international outlets like the BBC. It also blocked Facebook and Instagram and hamstrung users' ability to use Twitter. Each of those platforms — along with TikTok, which suspended new videos and live streaming in Russia in response to Russia’s law against ""false"" information — remain available in the U.S.   Russian President Vladimir Putin attends his annual news conference in Moscow, Russia, on Dec. 23, 2021. (AP) ""Russia is exercising extraordinary powers of censorship unseen in Russia since the Soviet era,"" said David Kaye, a clinical professor of law at the University of California, Irvine, and the former United Nations special rapporteur for freedom of opinion and expression. And it is filling the information void entirely with state-controlled media pushing the government’s messages. ""Is there anything remotely like this in the United States? No,"" Kaye said. ""The U.S. government lacks power under the Constitution to engage in the kind of actions taking place in Russia.""  News organizations in the U.S. operate independently of the government’s demands and create a diversity of information not easily found in countries with state-controlled media. That includes the U.S.’s state-owned outlets like Voice of America, which have editorial independence.  And while mainstream U.S. news organizations sometimes produce similar coverage, that’s a far cry from ""having that consensus chiefly stem from government coercion,"" said UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh, a Ukrainian-American and expert on First Amendment law. He added that speech in the U.S. is ""immeasurably freer"" than in Russia. Gabbard told PolitiFact that she was not saying that ""our lack of freedom of speech in the United States is as bad as in Russia,"" but that it’s heading that way. Institutions in Russia and the United States ""exert great control and influence"" over what people see and hear, causing people to fear that they will ""suffer"" if they say or do something different, she wrote in an email. ""In Russia, it is a powerful state/government which exerts such control,"" Gabbard said. ""In the United States, there is similar control but instead of the state directly having such control, it is giant tech and social media companies which are politically aligned with and work closely with those who hold political and institutional power."" Gabbard’s argument echoes conservative allegations of Big Tech bias and censorship against them. But plentiful research has cut against those claims.  In 2021, Twitter revealed that a study showed right-leaning news outlets were amplified on its platform more than left-leaning news outlets, and that tweets from right-leaning accounts similarly outpaced tweets from left-leaning accounts in the U.S. and other countries. Another 2021 study by researchers at New York University concluded that the allegations that social media companies censor conservatives are ""unfounded."" ""I know of no academic research that concludes there is a strong systemic bias — liberal or conservative — in how social media platforms identify what to show to users or in how they enforce their terms of service in content moderation decisions,"" said Steven L. Johnson, an associate professor of commerce at the University of Virginia who has studied social media.  Some Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have had accounts suspended, restricted, or marked with fact-checking labels. But those penalties have generally resulted from specific violations of the various platforms’ community guidelines. Gabbard said, ""What is happening here is not so different from what we're seeing happening in Russia, where you have got state TV and controlled messaging across the board."" Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia — a country with a long history of suppressing free speech and access to information — has restricted dissenting voices, independent news reporting and public discourse on social media platforms, including with a new law threatening prison time for spreading ""false"" information about the war. Those measures are without parallel in the U.S., where freedom of speech, expression and the press are enshrined in the Constitution.

Ron Johnson has not endorsed plan to phase out of Social Security, Medicare
","For more than half a century, Social Security and Medicare have been two of the most politically sacrosanct programs in the U.S.  That means hackles are raised anytime there are any plans, proposals, or allegations that changes are sought for the federal programs. Here in Wisconsin, the issue has come to the fore again, this time in the U.S. Senate race.  ""For over a decade, Ron Johnson has refused to fight for working Wisconsin families,"" Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate Alex Lasry said in a March 16, 2022 news release. ""Now, Ron Johnson is promising that if the GOP takes the majority, they are going to raise taxes on middle class workers and phase out Social Security and Medicare.""  A March 16, 2022 Lasry campaign ad cut to the chase and starkly said: ""Ron Johnson supports the new Republican plan that phases out Social Security and Medicare."" Is Johnson ""supporting the Republican plan that phases out Social Security and Medicare?""  The claim falls short from multiple angles. Lasry, an executive with the Milwaukee Bucks, is among the Democrats hoping to replace Johnson, a Republican seeking a third term in 2022. We reached out to the Lasry campaign to seek backup information for the claim, but did not receive a response by deadline. However, it’s clear the ad is referring to the 11-point ""Rescue America"" plan released in February 2022 by U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Florida. Scott is chairman of the Senate GOP’s campaign committee.  Point number six in the plan, covering ""Government Reform and Debt,"" states: ""All federal legislation sunsets in 5 years. If a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again.""  The proposal does not specifically say Medicare and Social Security would be phased out, but does refer to ""federal legislation."" And both programs were created generations ago through federal legislation.  Here is where the claim gets a bit messier. First, there is dissension among Republicans – notably Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who opposes key parts of it. ""Let me tell you what would not be a part of our agenda,"" McConnell said, according to The Associated Press. ""We will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half of the American people and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years.""  For his part, Johnson in a March 7, 2022 news release said this: ""Senator Rick Scott put forward his proposal that opposes reckless federal spending and intrusive government overreach and supports conservative goals like local control of education, election integrity, religious liberty, and an improved health care system. I think it’s important for elected officials to tell their constituents what they are for, and I support Senator Scott for doing so."" But that stopped short of endorsing everything in the package. ""Do I agree with everything on it? No. Most of it. I would have changes in certain things,"" Johnson said during an interview with the Breitbart Daily News Podcast, according to a March 8, 2022 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Jake Wilkins, communications director for the Johnson campaign, told PolitiFact Wisconsin that the senator ""had repeatedly said we need to save these programs for future generations."" ""There is no 'plan' put forward by the Republican Party to eliminate Medicare and Social Security, and Senator Johnson has no idea what Democrats are talking about,"" Wilkins said. That said, a look at our files shows Johnson has had a mixed history on Social Security and Medicare.  In 2016, we rated Half True a claim from Americans United for Change that ""Ron Johnson calls Social Security a Ponzi scheme and wants to privatize the program."" In doing so, we found: ""Johnson has expressed support for some form of privatization of Social Security, such as allowing individuals to invest some of their Social Security contributions, but it’s not clear that he backs complete privatization.""  Also that year, we rated Mostly True a Democratic Party of Wisconsin claim that ""Ron Johnson voted to turn Medicare ‘into a voucher program.’"" We found that Johnson supported a proposal from then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Janesville.  Under Ryan’s proposal, Medicare would no longer pay fees to health care providers -- instead, Medicare beneficiaries would get a fixed subsidy to use toward their health care. But neither of those relates directly to the claim at hand. And on that one, Lasry misses the mark. Lasry claimed Johnson ""is supporting the Republican plan that phases out Social Security and Medicare.""  But the plan is not backed by all Republicans (detractors include the Senate leader), does not directly call for the phase out of either program (it’s a generic statement on all laws being sunsetted for review) and Johnson has not endorsed any such phase-out (only the idea of Scott laying out a plan).  For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.   ",/factchecks/2022/mar/18/alex-lasry/ron-johnson-has-not-endorsed-plan-phase-out-social/
