Jeb Bush's Social Security plan raises retirement age to 70, Taddeo says
","Congressional hopeful Annette Taddeo warned Florida seniors preparing for a Thanksgiving feast that a Jeb Bush presidency could starve their plans for retirement. Taddeo, the former chair of the Miami-Dade Democratic Party, attempted to link Bush’s plan for Social Security to her Republican opponent, Carlos Curbelo of Miami, in a fundraising email PolitiFact Florida received Nov. 24, 2015 (click here to read the letter). ""Have you seen presidential hopeful Jeb Bush’s plan for Social Security? It’s disastrous for seniors and raises the retirement age to 70,"" the email read. ""But Bush is the candidate Annette’s opponent, Congressman Carlos Curbelo, thinks should be leading our country. Not that that’s a surprise after Curbelo called Social Security a ‘Ponzi scheme’ and voted for Speaker Ryan’s devastating budget. South Florida needs someone who will fight for Social Security — not work to end it."" Curbelo did call Social Security a Ponzi scheme in his first bid for Congress. That is not an accurate description of the program, so we rated Curbelo's statement False. For this fact-check, we wanted to know if Bush really released a Social Security plan for seniors that raises the retirement age to 70. (We won’t weigh in on whether it’s ""disastrous."") We found that Bush's plan doesn't suggest a specific age, and he also doesn't think the eligibility age should change for current seniors.  Bush’s comments Taddeo’s campaign directed us to a condensed version of Bush’s plan to reform Medicare and Social Security on Medium.com, which linked to the full plan on his website. Bush proposes allowing small businesses to set up collective or individual retirement accounts for workers. He also wants to slow down the growth of costs by cutting payments to higher-income seniors who have been able to save more while increasing minimum payments. Relevant to this fact-check, he suggests raising the retirement age, although he doesn’t say by how much. He says working longer is something many workers desire. ""We need to recognize that Americans are living longer, healthier lives, and we should make it easier for those who choose to work longer,"" Bush wrote. ""Life expectancy has increased substantially since Social Security was created in 1935. Yet Social Security’s structure still discourages work past the age of 62. Reforms should update Social Security to respect seniors’ desires and abilities to work later in life.""   That doesn’t mention 70 as the potential new retirement age for full benefits, though Bush did use that number earlier this year on CBS’ Face the Nation. Host Bob Schieffer noted during the May 31 interview that Bush favored raising the age and asked him how high.   ""I think it needs to be phased in over an extended period of time. I have seen ideas that are 68, for example,"" Bush said. ""So people that already have the supplemental retirement system, which is a contract, I don't think we violate that. For people that are about ready to be beneficiaries of their supplemental retirement, I don't think we change that. But we need to look over the horizon and begin to phase in over an extended period of time going from 65 to 68 or 70. And that by itself will help sustain the retirement system for anybody under the age of 40."" Bush has made similar comments at other points this year, though he only gave a specific age range to Schieffer. He has repeatedly said his plan would not affect current retirees or Americans nearing it. Bush told an audience in New Hampshire on April 17, ""I think we need to raise the retirement age, not for the people that already nearing (or) receiving Social Security ... but raise it gradually over a long period of time for people that are just entering the system."" And on June 2, a few days after appearing on Face the Nation, Bush told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, ""Social Security — I think we need to adjust it, because life expectancy has gone up, … adjusted by retirement age going up. … If we're going to fix it for the next 50 years, we need to start working on it now and progressively raise the retirement age. But people that are near retirement or already in retirement, I don't believe there should be any (impact)."" We should note that in his Face the Nation comments, Bush was wrong about the current retirement age. Bush suggested that the current retirement age for full benefits is 65, but that’s only for people born in 1937 or earlier. For people born between 1943 and 1954, the current retirement age for full benefits is 66, and the age rises incrementally after that. Those born in 1960 or later will get full benefits at 67. It’s clear Bush has brought up raising the retirement age for future Social Security beneficiaries as a way to stabilize the program. But Taddeo’s characterization of what he has said falls short on several fronts. Our ruling Taddeo said Bush’s plan for Social Security is ""disastrous for seniors and raises the retirement age to 70."" Taddeo has a point that Bush said he is open to the idea of raising retirement ages, but her email mischaracterizes his plan. Her email attempts to convince seniors nearing retirement that benefit changes are imminent if Bush is elected.  Bush has repeatedly said he does not intend to alter Social Security for current retirees or those who would be joining the program soon. And while 70 is one of several ages Bush threw out in an interview, his official plan doesn't establish specifics beyond stating age reforms are needed.  Taddeo’s statement contains an element of truth about Bush’s plan for Social Security but exaggerates that point to scare seniors. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/nov/30/annette-taddeo-goldstein/jeb-bushs-social-security-plan-raises-retirement-a/

Hartzler was modest on connection between drugs and foster care
","U.S. Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler, R-Missouri , visited ABC 17’s ""This Week"" on Oct. 9, and was asked about ""Take Back The District,"" an anti-drug initiative she was launching. Hartzler said drugs posed a significant problem in her district. Employers, she said, tell her they cannot find an employee to fill a position because applicants can’t pass a drug test, while military recruiters say they have to turn away otherwise exceptional recruits because of drug use. Hartzler talked about her years teaching at-risk teenagers and cited a widespread drug problem in the United States and one of its most sobering effects: the displacement of children into foster care. ""Twenty-five percent of our kids in foster care are there because their parents are involved in drugs,"" Hartzler said. Certainly drug use by parents can lead to state intervention, but is the number of reported cases really this high? Foster care According to the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, there are 397,122 children living in the foster system without permanent families. Hartzler has long been an advocate for the advancement of foster care, even co-publishing an article on its problems. Kyle Buckles, Hartzler’s communications director, pointed us toward the Green Book. Each year, statistics are compiled into the House of Representative’s Green Book, which is used to provide background material and data on the programs run by the Ways and Means Committee, including foster care. Foster care statistics Without considering alcohol, drug use by the parent was above 25 percent from 2010 through 2013, for which data is available. When alcohol is factored in, this number is more than 30 percent. Drug use is the second largest cause of the removal of children from their parent’s custody. The most prevalent circumstance for removal is neglect, which is present in over half of the cases in the United States — but it is important to remember that more than one factor may be cited in a particular case. For example, a child may be removed from his parents’ custody for neglect, parental drug abuse and child drug abuse. The problem appears to be getting worse. A 2009 study by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found that between the years 2002 and 2007, 12 percent of children between the ages of six to 11 were living with a parent who abused drugs or alcohol. Take Back the District Hartzler’s initiative has since met once to discuss the district’s drug issues. Her goal was to bring together law enforcement, parents, school officials, community leaders and citizens. The program met early on Oct. 19, where Hartzler, speakers and guests discussed the issuesand possible solutions to the problem and then diverted to a ""Faith-Based Rehabilitation and Ministry"" panel discussion. Our ruling Hartzler claimed that a quarter of children in foster care were there because of their parent’s drug abuse. Her claim is a modest estimation of the issue, according to reliable data kept by Congress. Drug abuse by parents is the second most prevalent reason for a parent losing custody of a child to foster care services. We rate this claim to be True.",/factchecks/2015/nov/30/vicky-hartzler/hartzler-was-modest-connection-between-drugs-and-f/

Sen. Roy Blunt right about future demand for food
","U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, attended the 2015 Missouri State Fair on Aug. 20 in Sedalia and won the support of agricultural associations, while opposing government regulations on agriculture. Surrounded by agricultural organization leaders, Blunt opposed the EPA’s proposed Clean Power Plan. ""The world food demand is going to double sometime between now and 2070. Nobody is better prepared to take advantage of that than we are, unless we let the regulators get in the way,"" Blunt said. We thought his estimation of the growth in demand sounded like an extreme claim and wanted to see the research. World food demand David Tilman is an author of the article ""Global food demand and the sustainable intensification of agriculture,"" and regents professor of ecology at the University of Minnesota. He’s conducted research focused on global food consumption and its effects. ""The senator is correct,"" Tilman said, ""Globally, increasing incomes and population mean that we likely will need to double the global production of crops within the next 40 to 50 years"" Projections from the United Nations, Food and Agriculture Organization, the University of Minnesota and many other researchers have found that world food demand, or the amount in which food production must increase, will double by sometime between 2050 and 2070. Why the growth? Global population is going to grow to almost 9.6 billion by 2050, and more than half of this is expected to occur in Sub-Saharan Africa, where one-quarter of the population is undernourished. Globally, income and urbanization has been growing rapidly for the past five decades, and with that comes increased demand for food and a change in diets. Global gross domestic production is projected to continue to grow at about 2.9 percent every year, with the most drastic changes occurring in developing countries. Researchers, including Tilman, have found that calorie and protein consumption is directly related to per capita GDP. In 2000, the richest countries were consuming 256 percent more calories and 430 percent more protein than the world's poorest nations. So as global GDP grows, as does population, so will the demand for world food. Also a steady increase in global income often leads to a change in diet. China’s long-growing increase in meat consumption, for example, is a result of increased income and is a trend observed throughout other developing nations. Population and diet change alone will cause a 69 percent increase in calorie demand by 2050, researchers say. Our ruling Blunt said, ""The world food demand is going to double sometime between now and 2070.""  The scientific community agrees.

Statement on smoking rates needs slightly more context
","Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and more than two dozen health professionals launched a statewide campaign last week to help Georgia smokers kick the habit. The ""Nobody Quits Like Georgia"" campaign emphasized connecting smokers with the counseling and other support they need to quit successfully. ""Atlanta and state-level health care leaders are taking action because while the national smoking rate has fallen, more than 18 percent of adults in Georgia are still smoking,"" Reed’s office said in a press release on Nov. 17. The health hazards of cigarette smoking have been publicly recognized at least since the mid1960s, so could almost one in five Georgia adults still be lighting up? PolitiFact decided to check. First, a little background. Health advocates have been pushing to reduce the national smoking rate among adults 18 and over to 12 percent by 2020. About 20.6 percent of American adults were smoking in 2009, but the percentage has dropped every year since. In 2013, 19 percent of adults, nationally, and 18.8 percent in Georgia, were smoking, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The CDC says smoking leads to disease and disability and harms nearly every organ of the body. More than 16 million Americans are estimated to be living with a smoking-related disease. These include cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung disease, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), according to the CDC. The financial toll of smoking is tremendous -- more than $300 billion a year in the United States alone. This includes about $170 billion in direct medical care for adults and more than $156 billion in lost productivity due to premature death and exposure to secondhand smoke, the federal agency estimates. So what about the city’s statement about the habit in Georgia? We started our fact-check by contacting Reed press secretary Jenna Garland. She told us the American Lung Association, lead sponsor of the campaign, provided the statistic that appeared in the press release. Searches of CDC statistics last week also verified that 18.8 percent of Georgia adults were identified as smokers in 2013, Garland said. ""At the time of our press conference and release, this data was absolutely correct. And it is still the primary data presented by the CDC,"" she said. Garland is right -- for 2013. The picture is peachier for Georgia, however, based on newer data for 2014. That was available in a press release put out by the Georgia Department of Public Health on the same day that Reed’s office issued its statement. In 2014, Georgia’s adult smoking rate had fallen to 17.4 percent, down 1.4 percentage points from 2013 as measured on the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System.(BRFSS). Particularly significant, the rate of smoking fell to 16.4 percent in young adults, ages 18 to 24, state officials said. National data from BRFSS for 2014 has not made public. We examined data gathered in the last 10 years on smoking rates in Georgia and the nation. You’ll see that smoking rates have been heading downward both in the state and nation throughout most, but not all of the decade. This is based on data collected by states through the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and submitted by the CDC. Percentage of Adults 18 and over who smoke Year Georgia U.S. 2005 22.1 20.8 2006 19.9 20.5 2007 19.4 20 2008 19.5 19.7 2009 17.7 18.3 2010 17.6 17.9 2011 21.2 21.2 2012 20.4 19.6 2013 18.8 19 2014 17.4 Not available Source: Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) reports and Georgia Department of Public Health.                                                              ---------------------
CDC spokeswoman Brittany Behm said that although the prevalence of smoking in Georgia has steadily declined in the past several years, the progress has not been as robust as it could have been. She said that’s largely because ""interventions we know work have not been fully implemented."" She said these include higher tobacco product prices, comprehensive smoke-free laws, hard-hitting mass media campaigns, and full and sustained funding for comprehensive tobacco control programs. ""Statistically, Georgia ranks 24th among the states and DC—almost exactly at the median,"" Behm said. Jean O’Connor, director of chronic disease prevention for the Georgia Department of Public Health, said state officials believe they’ve made serious headway, particularly with the tobacco-free schools program that’s now in 105 of the state’s 181 school districts. Enabling 1.3 million students to spend their school day free from exposure to tobacco appears to be showing up in the numbers, O’Connor said. With the smoking rate falling to 16.4 percent in the 18-24 age group, ""that tells us kids are aging up and not using tobacco products,"" she said. ""If you can get to 25 without using, odds of being addicted are very very low."" That’s reinforced in Georgia’s University System, one of the first in the nation to be smoke-free at its college and universities, O’Connor said. Our ruling A press release from Mayor Kasim Reed’s Office said: ""Atlanta and state-level health care leaders are taking action because while the national smoking rate has fallen, more than 18 percent of adults in Georgia are still smoking."" The first part of the statement is misleading. Smoking rates have generally been falling nationally and in Georgia. The state’s rate was lower than the national rate in 2013. Reed’s office is correct that, in 2013, 18.8 percent of Georgia adults over 18 were smoking. But newer figures paint a peachier picture for the state. It doesn’t change the mayor’s overarching point that the state still has a way to go. We rate Reed’s statement Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2015/nov/30/kasim-reed/Statement-on-smoking-rates-needs-slightly-more-con/
"['Islam', 'Terrorism', 'Virginia', 'Ted Cruz']","
Cruz is right: Obama doesn't link Islam to terrorism
","Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, says the U.S. can’t defeat an enemy it won’t define. The presidential candidate came to Richmond on Nov. 14 to address a gala dinner held by the Family Foundation, a socially conservative lobbying group. Before the speech, Cruz was asked during a news conference how the U.S. should respond to the terrorist attacks a day earlier in Paris. ""Well, the first thing we should do is identify the evil we are fighting,"" Cruz said. ""The fact that President Obama will not identify, he literally will not utter the words ‘radical Islamic terrorism’ and as matter of policy, nobody in the administration will say the words ‘radical Islamic terrorism.’"" We wondered whether the White House really does shun that phrase. We emailed the Cruz campaign twice but did not hear back. The White House press office also did not respond to emailed questions for this article. So we tried a LexisNexis search of media articles and speech transcripts that used the phrases ""Barack Obama"" and ""radical Islamic terrorism."" It brought up 1,900 items - more than we had the time to scour. But we did find in the list plenty of references to complaints by present and past GOP presidential contenders - Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Cruz - that Obama doesn’t use the phrase. We also ran the phrase ""radical Islamic terrorism"" through the search engine on the White House website and couldn’t find an instance of administration officials describing the Islamic State in that way. The closest thing was one instance, during a news briefing in February, when White House press secretary Josh Earnest referred to ""Islamic militants"" while discussing Islamic State fighters in Iraq. PolitiFact National, The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times all reported in February that the president and his administration try to avoid invoking Islam while describing the Islamic State and its followers, preferring to describe the organization’s philosophy in non-religious terms such as ""violent extremism."" Obama also has called the Islamic State a ""terrorist group"" with a ""twisted ideology."" The upshot, according to the articles, is that the White House wants to avoid tying the world’s 1.6 billion Muslims to terrorism. That could play into the hands of terrorists, who portray the U.S. as an enemy of Islam itself. Obama refers to ISIS by another acronym, ISIL. ""ISIL is not ‘Islamic,’"" he said in a Sept. 10, 2014, statement. ""No religion condones the killing of innocents."" In a Nov. 16 news conference in Turkey, Obama said the group does not represent Islam and ""is not representative in any way of the attitudes of the overwhelming majority of Muslims."" But Obama added that Muslims around the world ""have to ask very serious questions about how did these extremist ideologies take root, even if it’s only affecting a very small fraction of the population."" Two Middle East analysts told us the White House’s cautious phrasing is no coincidence. Rick Brennan, senior political scientist at the RAND Corp. said the administration avoids linking the words ""radical Islam"" and ""terrorism"" because it does not want to give the Islamic State religious legitimacy in the Islamic world and swell the organization’s ranks.  Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, had a similar take. There’s debate among analysts over the administration’s phraseology. Brennan told PolitFact National earlier this year that the White House’s wording has been ""too cautious,"" noting that Islamic State teachings reflect a strain of Islam that has attracted 40,000 or more followers. James Gelvin, a UCLA history professor, disagrees. He told PolitiFact that it’s unnecessary to emphasize a religious aspect of the Islamic State because ""their doctrine is exceedingly unpopular among most people who consider themselves Muslims."" Our ruling Cruz said that Obama administration won’t use the phrase ""radical Islamic terrorism."" Although we wouldn’t swear White House officials never have uttered the words in public, we could find no evidence to the contrary. It’s clear that the administration prefers non-religious ways to describe the Islamic State - such as a ""terrorist group,"" ""violent extremism"" and ""twisted ideology.""

"['History', 'Virginia', 'Ben Carson']","
Carson falsely says Thomas Jefferson helped 'craft' the Constitution
","During a recent TV interview, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson was asked which Founding Father impressed him the most. ""I’m particularly impressed with Thomas Jefferson, who seemed to have a very deep insight into the way people would react and tried to craft a constitution in a way that would control people’s natural tendencies and control the natural growth of government,"" Carson replied during a Nov. 22 broadcast on C-SPAN. Our ears perked up, because Jefferson was an ocean away from Philadelphia during the late spring and summer of 1787 when the Constitutional Convention met at Independence Hall. He was in Paris, serving as minister to France for the Confederation Congress. So did Jefferson really play a role in crafting the U.S. Constitution? Let’s take a look. Although Carson did not acknowledge Jefferson’s absence from the convention in the C-SPAN interview, he did note it in his recently published book ""A More Perfect Union,"" which urges Americans to ""reclaim our constitutional liberties."" Ying Ma, a spokeswoman for Carson, backed the claim about Jefferson’s role in crafting the Constitution by pointing to a biography of the third president posted on the Library of Congress website. It says, ""Although Thomas Jefferson was in France serving as United States minister when the federal constitution was written in 1787, he was able to influence the development of the federal government though his correspondence."" We contacted four Jefferson historians, and they all disagreed with Carson’s statement and evidence. When it came to the drafting of the constitution, which was done under a cloak of secrecy, they say Jefferson was in the dark. ""Jefferson didn’t know what was going on at all,"" said Joseph Ellis, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who wrote ""American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson."" Peter Onuf, a retired University of Virginia professor who specialized in Jefferson, wrote in an email, ""Jefferson never ‘crafted’ a constitution (federal or state), nor did he have any influence over the secret proceedings at Philadelphia. Technically speaking, Jefferson was not a ‘founder’ at all, having been absent from the founding - but Carson is certainly not alone in according him that status."" Jefferson was abroad from August 1784 through November 1789. He maintained steady correspondence with James Madison, who would become known as the ""Father of the Constitution."" Historians say Jefferson indirectly may have influenced Madison’s political thinking when, in 1785, he shipped to his friend almost 200 books from Paris on government, philosophy, religion and other subjects. Madison delved deeply into the books. But when it came to forming a government, Jefferson and Madison were miles apart in thought and distance. Jefferson opposed the creation of a strong central government; Madison supported it. Shortly after the Constitutional Convention began, Madison sent Jefferson a letter naming the delegates but withholding all other information. ""In furnishing you with this list of names, I have exhausted all the means which I can make use of for gratifying your curiosity,"" Madison wrote in June 1787. ""It was thought expedient in order to secure unbiassed (sic) discussion within doors, and to prevent misconceptions and misconstructions without, to establish some rules of caution which will for no short time restrain even a confidential communication of our proceedings."" In October 1787 - a month after the convention had agreed on a constitution and adjourned - Madison wrote Jefferson a long letter detailing the accord that was being sent to states for ratification. Jefferson described himself as ""neutral"" on the constitution, according Dumas Malone’s 1951 book ""Jefferson and the Rights of Man."" Malone wrote that Jefferson was pleased by the way a bicameral Congress would be set up but, like many anti-federalists, was disappointed the document did not include a bill of rights. By the time Jefferson returned from Europe in 1789, all but one of the states had approved the Constitution - only Rhode Island was holding out - and a new nation had been born. Two months before his landing, Congress had approved the Bill of Rights, which would win the necessary ratification by two-thirds of the states in 1791. Our ruling Carson identified Jefferson as a craftsman of the U.S. Constitution - a frequently made mistake. Jefferson played many leading roles in history, including as author of the Declaration of Independence, president of the United States, and founder of the University of Virginia. But in the production of the Constitution, Jefferson didn’t even make a cameo appearance. He was in France during the entirety of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, shut out from the top-secret deliberations. When he returned to the U.S. in 1789, the Constitution had been ratified, a president was in office, and the 1st Congress was open for business. Historians with whom we spoke say Jefferson, at most, deserves a footnote at the end of the credits for sending books from abroad that may have influenced Madison’s thinking. So we rate Carson’s statement False.",/factchecks/2015/nov/27/ben-carson/carson-falsely-says-thomas-jefferson-helped-craft-/

Facebook comment says illegal immigrants mow Texas Capitol lawn
"," Commenting on Gov. Greg Abbott pressing sheriffs to detain individuals living in the country without legal authorization, a reader brought up workers who groom the grounds of the Texas Capitol. ""Illegal immigrants mow the grass around the Capitol,"" said a Facebook comment posted Nov. 10, 2015, in reaction to the Austin American-Statesman’s summary of the paper’s Nov. 5, 2015, news story about Abbott telling Texas sheriffs he might withhold criminal justice grant aid if they don’t fully comply with federal requests for detaining ""criminal immigrants"" held in their jails. The newspaper published that comment, among others, prompting us to wonder: Do undocumented workers really mow the Capitol lawn? We attempted to reach the commenter to see how he reached his conclusion and didn’t hear back. Nationally, according to a July 2015 web post by the Pew Research Center, undocumented immigrants make up 5.1 percent of the nation’s labor force. ""In the U.S. labor force,"" the post says, ""there were 8.1 million unauthorized immigrants either working or looking for work in 2012. Among the states, Nevada (10%), California (9%), Texas (9%) and New Jersey (8%) had the highest shares of unauthorized immigrants in their labor forces. Closer to home, we reached the State Preservation Board, which manages the Capitol and nearby state facilities. By email, spokesman Chris Currens said the board contracts with a private company to care for the grounds and that company is required to use the online federal E-Verify system, authorized by Congress in 1996, which enables users to determine whether employees are citizens or have a required visa to work legally here. ""In short,"" the government says, ""employers submit information taken from a new hire's Form I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification Form) through E-Verify to the Social Security Administration and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to determine whether the information matches government records and whether the new hire is authorized to work in the United States."" U.S. employers submit the Form I-9 for each employee; on the form, an employee must attest to his or her employment authorization. In addition, a government summary says, the employee must present his or her employer with ""acceptable documents"" showing who they are and that they’re eligible to work in the country. Documents that fit the description, according to the form, include passports and permanent resident or alien registration cards. A note: E-Verify may be a flawed method of weeding out ineligible workers. In a July 2015 report, the Cato Institute pointed out that a government-commissioned analysis estimated that 54 percent of ""unauthorized workers submitted to E-Verify were incorrectly found to be work authorized because of rampant document fraud."" The cited Westat report, published in 2009, elaborated: ""This finding is not surprising, given that since the inception of E-Verify it has been clear that many unauthorized workers obtain employment by committing identity fraud that cannot be detected by E-Verify."" An upshot, Alex Nowrasteh of Cato told us by phone, is that ""even if"" workers ""cleared E-Verify, that doesn’t mean they’re legal."" Back to Texas: In December 2014, then-Gov. Rick Perry ordered agencies to use E-Verify. Perry told reporters then that 17 agencies already employed the system. Currens told us the State Preservation Board initially placed a clause requiring contractors to use E-Verify in April 2009 and grounds contracts have included the clause ever since. Also, Currens noted, each contract requires the contractor to certify that each employee is in compliance with federal immigration laws. The current Capitol groundskeeping contract, which is with Clean Scapes, an Austin company, requires the contractor to subject employees to pre-employment and annual criminal background checks. The company also must obtain photocopies of the worker’s driver’s license or state-issued photo identification and Social Security card or Resident Alien work visa/identification card. And the company  ""must provide documentation showing that this request has been met for all employees working"" on preservation-board-overseen properties. We asked the agency for the latest documentation. By email, Currens sent an undated notice to the board from Marilu Sanchez, a Clean Scapes human resources specialist, stating the company had run E-Verify for six employees, each one listed by name. Currens said the notice was submitted to cover the workers at the Capitol in the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, 2015. By phone, Carmen Zayas, a Clean Scapes vice president, said the landscaping company has long checked all its workers through the E-Verify system. ""People are always going to make assumptions about the landscaping industry"" employing immigrants without legal permission to live here, Zayas said. ""We take that process as seriously as anyone can."" By email, Currens told us the board ""is confident that the groundskeeping workers have proper legal status."" Our ruling A Facebook comment published in the American-Statesman said: ""Illegal immigrants mow the grass around the (Texas) Capitol."" If so, such immigrants have fooled the federal E-Verify system and the agency that oversees the Capitol grounds. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

So far in the 2015-2016 election, $4.88 million in dark money expenditures, mostly by conservative groups, have been made. That’s more than 10 times what was spent at this point during the 2011-2012 cycle -- when a total of $308 million in dark money was spent. It remains to be seen how much dark money might be spent on either side as Feingold challenges Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson in 2016, in a rematch of their 2010 contest. The ad In the TV ad, when the claim about Feingold and dark money is made, footnotes alluding to two news articles appear on the screen. The major one was a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story in June 2015 on spending by two groups Feingold formed in February 2011:  Progressives United PAC, a liberal political action committee, and Progressives United Inc., a so-called 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization. The Journal Sentinel article reported that data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics showed the PAC had given a mere 5 percent of its income to federal candidates and political parties. Instead, nearly half of the $7.1 million that had been spent went to raising more money for itself. The article also said Feingold and nine of his former campaign and U.S. Senate staffers drew salaries or consulting fees from the PAC, and five of them also spent time on the payroll of Progressives United Inc., the nonprofit. PACs, however, are required to disclose their donors. So, our focus here is on the Progressives United Inc. nonprofit. It is a dark money group in that 501(c)(4) groups (a reference to the Internal Revenue Service code) are not required to disclose their donors. At the same time, nothing prevents nonprofits such as Progressives United Inc. from disclosing donors on their own. The money Federal tax filings show Progressives United Inc. paid Feingold as president of the group $10,000 in 2011, $30,000 in 2012 and $19,500 in 2013 -- a total of $59,500. But he is no longer ""profiting"" from the nonprofit in that he took a leave from Progressives United after being selected a special envoy to the Great Lakes region of Africa in June 2013. He hasn’t received any payments since 2013. But Progressives United Inc. didn’t actually operate as a conventional dark-money group does -- at least while it was active. A Feingold campaign spokesman sent us links (using the ""Way Back Machine"" -- archive.org) so that we could access pages from the Progressive United Inc. website that have since been taken down. The donors were listed for 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. But Progressives United Inc. stopped operating at the end of 2014 and its website is dormant. That means the donor lists are no longer readily available -- at a time, with Feingold running for the Senate, when public interest in the lists might be high. A Feingold campaign spokesman told us the website is no longer active because Progressives United Inc. no longer is taking in income to pay for expenses such as web hosting. Our rating The National Republican Senatorial Committee said Feingold ""wanted to get money out of politics. Now he's profiting from that same dark money."" Feingold received $59,500 in salary from Progressives United Inc., a non-profit founded by Feingold that is not required to disclose its donors, but stopped receiving payments in 2013. While it was active, the group voluntarily listed its donors on its website. But those lists are no longer readily accessible, since the group’s website is no longer active.   For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.

U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson wants to take first steps to privatize the VA, challenger Russ Feingold says
","In an interview on a liberal talk show on Madison radio, Russ Feingold answered a question about the Veterans Administration -- hit by scandals nationally and in Wisconsin -- by contrasting himself and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, the man who took his Senate seat in 2010. Mike Crute, co-host of the ""The Devil’s Advocates,"" asked Feingold on Nov. 12, 2015: ""Do you think we have a problem with the Veterans Administration, does it need major reform, or does it simply need more financial resource?"" Feingold, a Democrat who was in the Senate for 18 years, began his reply by saying: ""Well, this is an area of enormous difference between me and the incumbent senator."" Then he made an attack on Johnson, saying of his Republican opponent in the 2016 Senate race: ""Look, we have to show a genuine commitment to make sure that veterans, when they come home, are able to get a job and that they have timely and adequate health care. The answer is not to privatize the VA. And Ron Johnson said specifically that he hopes the first steps occur to privatize the VA."" As we’ll see, Johnson has advocated for privatizing elements of the VA -- such as allowing veterans to get medical care outside the VA system. But he has not gone so far to call for replacing a public system with an entirely private one. VA scandals The Veterans Administration’s medical care of veterans, both nationally and in Wisconsin, has been under fire for more than a year and a half. In May 2014, Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned from President Barack Obama's cabinet. There had been intense scrutiny of the VA during the previous month, following allegations that 40 patients died while awaiting care at a Phoenix VA hospital where employees kept a secret waiting list to cover up delays. It turned out to be a system-wide problem in which VA employees lied about how quickly they saw patients to take advantage of a program that incentivized VA hospitals if they scheduled a primary care appointment within 14 days. In January 2015, the California-based Center for Investigative Reporting revealed that doctors at the VA medical center in Tomah, Wis., handed out so many narcotic painkillers that some veterans took to calling the place ""Candy Land."" That led to scrutiny from the VA and state regulators, as well as the arrests of three people on charges of illegal drug sales at the facility. Also in January 2015, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel columnist Daniel Bice reported that Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin -- under fire for her office's inaction over alleged overmedication at Tomah -- abruptly ousted one of her top state staffers. And in March 2015, Bice reported that Johnson aides had sat on whistleblower tips about the facility. Johnson on the VA As for Johnson’s position on the VA, there’s no question he has pressed for turning to the private sector for some aspects of care. A couple of weeks after the VA secretary’s resignation, the Senate passed legislation aimed at easing scheduling problems at Veterans Affairs facilities by allowing the VA to contract with private medical facilities -- enabling veterans facing long waits to get quicker treatment. The bill also enabled the VA to use $500 million from its current budget to hire more medical staff. Johnson was one of only three senators to vote no, indicating he wanted to go further, in terms of private options. He said at the time that he preferred another bill, which he co-sponsored, that would have given veterans the ability to receive treatment outside the VA system -- not just from private facilities the VA might contract with. ""I want to fix the problem and I think the best way to fix it is that we give veterans the ability to exit the system if they're not given quality care in a timely manner or if they're too far from a VA (facility),"" Johnson said. The Feingold campaign cited that statement among others as evidence to back Feingold’s claim. These two statements were from March 2015 were the strongest: According to to VoteVets.org, which has produced material criticizing Johnson, Johnson said at a campaign event: ""I’ll tell you from my standpoint, I believe the long-term solution on VA hospitals is, start moving it more toward a private system."" In an interview with a Wausau, Wis., TV station, Johnson was asked if veterans should be treated in private health care. He said: ""We're moving toward that model. The veterans' health care bill that we did pass, the Choice Act, starts a pilot program. And we need to assess that, we need to look at that very carefully. I don't want to throw everybody under the bus. I think the vast majority of people who work in the VA system are doing it because they really want to provide good, quality care. But, again, it's a bureaucratic, government-run system, and that's just a problem."" Again, Johnson was advocating a move toward more privatization. But he left the door open to making changes that would stop short of turning to a completely private system. For example, in an October 2015 statement cited by Feingold’s campaign, Johnson said: ""I really do think that is probably the long-term solution for the VA healthcare system is move more towards veterans’ choice. Accessing the private care system as opposed to building new centers that we’re not able to staff. There’s a better way of doing this. And I think it really is relying more on a private healthcare system."" Our rating Feingold said ""Johnson said specifically that he hopes the first steps occur to privatize the"" Veterans Administration. Johnson has advocated for privatizing at least parts of the VA system, but not for moving to a completely private system. We rate Feingold’s claim Half True.

Did Maggie Hassan vote against legislation to “prevent sanctuary cities"" in New Hampshire?
","Ever since New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan decided to run for U.S. Senate against incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte, the two-term Democratic governor has come under GOP fire. The state Republican party recently took aim at Hassan’s record on immigration, suggesting that Hassan has supported so-called ""sanctuary city"" policies that protect illegal immigrants from federal laws. ""In 2008, then-state Sen. Maggie Hassan voted to kill legislation that would have blocked any effort to promote sanctuary city policies in New Hampshire and protect illegal immigrants convicted of violent crimes,"" party chairwoman Jennifer Horn said in a memo titled ""Maggie Hassan’s terrible campaign kickoff."" PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to take a closer look at Hassan’s voting record in the state Senate. Before we get into the the specific New Hampshire legislation, let’s explain what the term ""sanctuary city"" means. As PolitiFact has noted before, there is no specific legal definition of ""sanctuary city."" Generally, though, the term refers to places where local law enforcement officers aren’t required to alert federal authorities to residents who may be in the country illegally. The policies have come into question nationally following the recent shooting death of a San Francisco woman, allegedly by a Mexican native with a criminal record. San Francisco’s quarter-century-old law declaring it a ""city and county of refuge"" generally bans public employees from assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement with investigations or arrests unless required by a law or a warrant. In New Hampshire, the issue of sanctuary cities came up for debate during the 2008 legislative session. Then, former state Sen. Joe Kenney, a Republican, proposed legislation that would have barred New Hampshire from serving ""as a sanctuary for illegal aliens."" The bill also mandated that state law enforcement agencies enforce federal immigration laws ""to the extent authorized by federal law."" Hassan, then a state senator, was one of 13 Democrats who voted to kill the bill, which went down in a 13-10 vote along party lines. The state Republican Party pointed to that 2008 vote to back up their claim that Hassan voted against any effort to curb sanctuary city policies and protect illegal immigrants convicted of violent crimes. The bill, SB353, specifically stated New Hampshire ""shall not serve as a sanctuary for illegal aliens"" and police ""shall enforce federal immigration laws to the extent authorized by federal law."" A spokesman for Hassan’s senatorial campaign said she voted against it because it was an unfunded mandate.   It’s worth noting New Hampshire was not home to any sanctuary cities then, nor were any efforts in the works to establish sanctuary cities in the state. And more than seven years later, New Hampshire still has no sanctuary cities,  according to national lists and state officials. In other words, this was mostly symbolic legislation, since no efforts were under way to promote sanctuary cities then, nor are there any efforts now. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service published a 2006 report listing 31 cities and counties that ""will generally promote policies that ensure such aliens will not be turned over to federal authorities."" No New Hampshire municipalities appeared on the list. The Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors stricter immigration laws, regularly updates a map on its website detailing sanctuary cities, counties and states. No New Hampshire cities or counties appeared on that map either. And New Hampshire didn’t appear on a list created by the Ohio Jobs and Justice PAC, which was founded by Steve Salvi, a critic of sanctuary cities. In addition, both New Hampshire Deputy Attorney General Ann Rice and Tilton Police Chief Robert Cormier, who heads the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police, said they are unaware of any sanctuary cities in the state. That brings us to the second piece of the bill, which would have required police to enforce federal immigration laws, to the extent allowed by federal law. Several years before SB353 was filed, in 2005, New Hampshire made national news because two of its police chiefs -- one in tiny New Ipswich and the other in the larger town of Hudson -- decided to use local criminal trespassing laws to arrest and detain immigrants who couldn’t prove they were here legally. A judge later ruled that the chiefs had violated the Constitution by trying to enforce federal laws, and the charges were dismissed after immigration lawyers challenged the trespassing charges levied against 8 men. New Hampshire police only have the authority to enforce state laws and local ordinances, not federal immigration laws, Rice said. Still, New Hampshire police do play a role in immigration enforcement. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency known as ICE, gets fingerprints from local law enforcement officers when they arrest and book a suspect. Under an initiative called Priority Enforcement Program, ICE then determines whether to detain the person for removal. ICE targets people who have been ""convicted of significant criminal offenses or who otherwise pose a threat to public safety."" If ICE decides the suspect should be detained, the federal agency requests a transfer from local law enforcement. ""All we do, is we would contact ICE and they would make a determination,"" said Cormier, who doesn’t know of any local police departments that don’t comply. ""We are sworn to uphold all state and federal laws, and part of that is to notify federal authorities if we get a hit on someone they are looking for,"" he said. Our ruling The New Hampshire Republican Party said that Maggie Hassan, as a state senator, ""voted to kill legislation that would have blocked any effort to promote sanctuary city policies in New Hampshire."" Hassan did vote against a 2008 bill that would have prohibited New Hampshire from serving as a ""sanctuary for illegal aliens."" However, it’s worth noting there were no efforts to establish sanctuary cities in the state at the time, nor are there any efforts today.   The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/nov/25/jennifer-horn/did-maggie-hassan-vote-against-legislation-prevent/

Cynthia Meyer says more black babies are aborted in New York City than born
","During the first Democratic presidential debate in October 2015, Hillary Clinton proclaimed, ""We’ve got to be committed to getting every child to live up to his or her God-given potential."" Cynthia Meyer, who took up the post of deputy press secretary for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in early 2015, fired back with a tweet, ""Would help if they had the chance to be born."" About a month later, in the next Democratic debate Nov. 14, 2015, the episode was repeated. Clinton echoed her earlier comment, again declaring, ""Every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential."" This time, Meyer responded by tweeting, ""More black babies are aborted in NYC than born,"" followed by the hashtag #blacklivesmatter. NYC meaning the city of New York. The pair of exchanges elicited a strong sense of deja vu, but Meyer’s second tweet raised a more specific question about abortion rates among black women in the Big Apple: Are there more abortions by black women in NYC than births? To our inquiry, over email Meyer said her responses were an effort to highlight the value of human life and call attention to NYC’s ""startling"" numbers, which come from a 2013 report on pregnancy outcomes compiled by the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s Bureau of Vital Statistics. The numbers have been widely reported by conservative media outlets, including a National Review article that Meyer emailed to us. ""To be clear, that tweet came from my personal Twitter account and I was speaking as a private citizen,"" Meyer said in an email. ""Happy to defend the stats, though."" Abortions by black women in NYC outpacing births?  Figuring out the answer to this question proved rather simple. The first place we went was that 2013 report, the most recent data available, which provides exhaustive breakdowns of birth statistics in New York City. The agency lists pregnancy outcomes by race and ethnicity, as well as by borough, type of birth (live birth, C-section, premature) and health of the mother. According to the report, in 2013 black women accounted for 29,007 terminated pregnancies, representing almost 42 percent of all abortions in the city. That same year, black women in the city gave birth to 24,108 babies. With abortions surpassing live births by nearly 5,000, African American women in the city clearly terminated pregnancies more often than they carried babies to term. Black women terminated pregnancies at a rate of 67.3 per 1,000 women ages 15 to 49, a rate far higher than any other racial or ethnic group. We checked: the statistics were similar the previous year, when African American women in the city had 24,758 births and underwent 31,328 abortions.   The numbers for black women in NYC starkly contrasted with women in other racial and ethnic categories. In 2013, births far surpassed abortions for white, Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander women. Hispanic women accounted for the second-most abortions in the city with 21,555, but they also had 35,581 live births. Asian women had both the fewest abortions and fewest births, while white women accounted for the most births overall and second-fewest abortions. There was less discrepancy between the number of births and terminated pregnancies for black women statewide. In 2013, black women in New York state gave birth to 36,130 babies and underwent 34,960 abortions, according to the state’s health department. During the previous year, the numbers were almost dead even, with black women accounting for 36,905 births and 36,633 abortions across the state.   The numbers are far different for the four biggest cities in Texas. The Texas Department of State Health Services reports births by both county and city, but abortions are only reported by county. We examined the numbers in 2013 for Bexar, Dallas, Harris and Travis Counties, which contain the cities of San Antonio, Dallas, Houston and Austin, respectively. In all four counties, black women had more live births than abortions. The same was true for white women in those counties. For Harris County, which includes Houston, the largest city in Texas and fourth-largest city nationwide, black women had 12,569 live births and 5,515 abortions, while white women accounted for 16,247 births and 2,661 abortions. If you’d like to peruse the numbers for all four counties, we input the data into a Google spreadsheet for easier side-by-side comparison. It’s important to note that abortion access across the state of Texas stands in stark contrast to NYC. Texas currently has 19 operating abortion clinics, but that number would drop to 10 if the U.S. Supreme Court allows the state's contested 2013 law to fully take effect.  In contrast, New York state has 80 abortion clinics. Attitudes toward abortion also differ greatly between the two states. Nationally in 2009, black women had abortions far more often than white and Hispanic women, according to data compiled in December 2013 by the National Center for Health Statistics. For some perspective, an online search turned up a 2008 Guttmacher Policy Review article by Susan A. Cohen, a vice president for the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and abortion rights. Cohen, saying the national abortion rate for black women is almost five times the rate for white women, suggested this is greatly explained by higher incidences of unintended pregnancy among African American residents. Higher rates, Cohen wrote, ""reflect the particular difficulties that many women in minority communities face in accessing high-quality contraceptive services and in using their chosen method of birth control consistently and effectively over long periods of time. Moreover, these realities must be seen in a larger context in which significant racial and ethnic disparities persist for a wide range of health outcomes, from diabetes to heart disease to breast and cervical cancer to sexually transmitted infections (STI), including HIV."" In examining the socioeconomic factors behind this phenomena, Cohen disputed the idea that black women are recruited into having more abortions, a sentiment that has been shared by anti-abortion activists and conservative politicians. These issues were also extensively explored last September by Zoe Dutton in a piece for The Atlantic called ""Abortion’s Racial Gap."" GOP leaders have used these statistics to argue against abortion, positing that it disproportionately affects black communities. In August, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson articulated this stance in relation to Planned Parenthood, claiming during an appearance on Fox News that the organization has contributed to abortion being ""the number one cause of death for black people."" The leading causes of death for black Americans are actually heart disease, cancer and stroke, according to the CDC, but Carson’s rhetoric speaks to the GOP’s broader stance against abortion. The debate over abortion has taken on more fervor in recent years as many states have introduced increased abortion restrictions. Texas has led in this area, in 2013 enacting a law requiring abortion clinics to adhere to the standards of surgical centers and employ doctors with admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic. In November 2015, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging the constitutionality of those two provisions as undue burdens on women seeking abortions. Our ruling:  A Hillary Clinton declaration that every child should be allowed to live up to his potential prompted a tweet from a spokeswoman for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton that ""More black babies are aborted in NYC than born."" The tweet from Deputy Press Secretary Cynthia Meyer echoes what has become a talking point among anti-abortion activists, that abortion disproportionately affects the nation’s African American population. Nationally, African American women had a higher rate of abortion than whites, Hispanics or Asians, according to 2013 figures. Even so, black women gave birth more than they terminated pregnancies that year. The same was not true for New York City, where more abortions were recorded for black woman than live births in both 2012 and 2013, the most recent available data. We rate this claim True. TRUE -- The statement is accurate and there's nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. CLARIFICATION, 4:20 p.m., Dec. 1, 2015: We amended this fact check to clarify that the described 2013 abortion rate for black women related to women aged 15 to 49.

Jeb Bush says United States lacks military equipment so it has to borrow in Europe
","Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush called for using ground troops against the Islamic State and beefing up our military the week after the Paris terrorist attacks. Bush criticized President Barack Obama and Congress for weakening the military through ""careless, chronic neglect,"" summing up the lack of sufficient personnel and equipment with a single anecdote. ""To conduct training exercises under our NATO obligations in Europe, American forces have been borrowing helicopters and other vehicles from our allies. Really,"" Bush said in a speech at The Citadel on Nov. 18. ""We don’t have enough of our own hardware and equipment even for training purposes. So the Brits are spotting us choppers. That’s just not unsafe — that’s embarrassing for the greatest country on the face of the Earth. Whatever challenges we face in Europe or elsewhere, we’re not going to meet them with borrowed equipment."" China, however, has been spending heavily on new military equipment, Bush said. We wanted to know if the U.S. military is so hard up that it’s borrowing choppers from the Brits. Borrowed equipment Military experts told PolitiFact that the decline in equipment and personnel dates back to the end of the Cold War, so it’s not entirely the fault of Obama and Republicans in Congress. However, the cuts have been stepped up over recent years as part of sequestration, the across-the-board spending cuts that went into effect in 2013 after Congress failed to reach a budget agreement. A spokesman for the Bush campaign sent us two October 2015 news articles quoting Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the Army’s commanding general in Europe, talking about his equipment shortages. As the number of U.S. military personnel in Europe has dropped 35 percent since 2012, the Army has reduced some equipment or relocated it, the New York Times reported. It’s possible for the Army to bring equipment to Europe from bases in the United States, but that is expensive and time consuming. ""I don’t have bridges, I don’t have the trucks that can carry tanks, we don’t have enough helicopters to do what we need to do,"" Hodges told the New York Times. ""Practicing with British helicopters here is an essential part of it. Using British and German bridges, using Hungarian air defense is part of it."" A spokesman for the Army, Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, said Hodges has consistently said that his forces lack sufficient airplanes. ""Whether this is 'embarrassing' or simply a reality of Army force structure relative to global conditions is a matter of opinion,"" Buccino said. He confirmed that the Army has been sharing equipment — as it did during a multinational exercise in Europe in August. ""This is not a new development,"" Buccino said. ""Our forces often train with partnered militaries using host-nation equipment. In fact, training with NATO allies across platforms and equipment allows us to develop interoperability across the alliance, which would be crucial if we have to fight in the European theater."" The United States started scaling back in Europe about 25 years ago, a strategy ""predicated on the notion of benign or at least non-hostile Russia,"" said Mark Cancian, a retired colonel with the Marines Reserve and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""What’s happened in the last two years has upset those assumptions, and everybody recognizes that."" Obama ""gets a little credit"" for trying to beef up the military in Europe, Cancian said. The Obama administration put together the European Reassurance Initiative, which includes $985 million for 2015 and requested $789 million in 2016. Steve Saideman, a professor at Carleton University in Canada who recently wrote a book about NATO, said the whole idea of NATO exercises is to improve working together, so it makes sense that it would include riding in another nation’s airplanes. Plus, it can be cheaper than sending them in from overseas. ""I really don’t see the problem with this,"" Saideman told PolitiFact. ""It is a way to grandstand on the issue, but it has no real substance. The larger issue facing the military is the unpredictability produced by sequestration, and Bush’s party represents half or more of the sequestration problem."" Lisa Samp, a Center for Strategic and International Studies fellow, says that Bush’s statement sounds like a bit of semantics. ""If in a multinational training exercise we put U.S. soldiers on another nations’ troop transport vehicles or aircraft, are we ‘borrowing’ their equipment or simply conducting joint training?"" said Samp, who served as director for NATO and European Strategic Affairs at the National Security Council from 2014-15. Samp said that there is a disconnect between our stated commitment in Europe and the forces we have there. ""The good news in Europe is that we have allies to help fill gaps; this is not so much a sign of weakness (as Bush suggests) but of a working alliance,"" she said. The decline of American forces in Europe is an outgrowth of the planned pivot to Asia, said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. And as PolitiFact Florida has previously noted, the military is in the process of buying and upgrading all sorts of military equipment, including the largest aircraft procurement ever: the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. One final note on China, which Bush said is increasing its military capability. The United States spent as much on the military in 2013 as the next eight countries combined, including China. ""Jeb Bush claims the United States military risks sliding to inferiority. Inferior to who exactly?"" said Matthew Fay, a defense expert at the libertarian Niskanen Center. ""By the best available estimates, the United States spent over $300 billion more than China and Russia combined in 2014."" Our ruling Bush said, for NATO exercises ""we don’t have enough of our own hardware and equipment even for training purposes. So the Brits are spotting us choppers."" The U.S. Army in Europe has used military equipment of allies as part of NATO obligations. However, Bush omits that the U.S. military has been cutting back in Europe since the Cold War, so cuts over eight years are nothing new. Experts say the equipment sharing isn’t as problematic as Bush makes it seem because the military is working with allies as part of NATO. With those caveats, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/nov/25/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-united-states-lacks-military-equipme/

10,000 IRS agents but only 2 dozen people focused on 'violent extremism'?
","Four days after the Paris terror attacks, House Speaker Paul Ryan led a news conference to discuss a bill that would require President Barack Obama to develop a plan for defeating the Islamic State. The Janesville Republican was joined Nov. 17, 2015 by U.S. Rep. Martha McSally, who made a claim -- comparing the number of Internal Revenue Service agents to the number of people ""countering violent extremism"" in America -- that we want to check. ""This administration needs to step up,"" said McSally, an Arizona Republican. ""We do not have a strategy. We do not have a focus. There are over 200,000 social media tweets and posts per day by ISIS, in a very sophisticated social media campaign. They are acting at the speed of broadband while we are acting at the speed of bureaucracy."" She added: ""We have 10,000 IRS agents making sure that you don't take an improper charity deduction and less than two dozen people focusing on countering violent extremism at home. It’s time for this administration to step up its game, take this seriously. It is a generational conflict and we must lead now more than ever."" McSally greatly understated what the IRS’ 10,000 revenue agents do. And to conclude there are only two dozen people who focus on countering violent extremism in the country, she defined that group very narrowly. Let’s take a closer look. Checking charitable deductions On the IRS part of McSally’s statement, her office asked the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service how many revenue agents the IRS has, according to emails forwarded to us by her staff. The IRS told the research service there were 10,840. A revenue agent, the research service told McSally, ""typically is an accountant who audits and examines the tax returns of individuals, businesses, and tax-exempt entities to determine whether they are meeting their tax obligations."" In other words, the work of the 10,000 IRS agents is much broader than merely checking whether a taxpayer improperly claimed a tax deduction for making a charitable donation. It’s also not necessarily surprising the number is as high as it is, given that millions of people and entities file federal income taxes. And only a federal agency, not state or local authorities, would be involved in auditing federal returns. That’s in contrast to the approach taken in countering violent extremism. Countering violent extremism Now for the second part of McSally’s claim -- that there are fewer than two dozen people ""focusing on countering violent extremism"" in America, which isn’t exactly the same as fighting terrorism. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, citing a White House strategy document on countering violent extremism, says violent extremists are ""individuals who support or commit ideologically-motivated violence to further political goals."" So, countering violent extremism is an effort to prevent such violence. We asked for more clarification from Amy Pate, research director of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. She said: Think of a 20-year-old, marginalized, radicalized American who one day shows up at the airport with a ticket to fly to Turkey and join ISIS. Countering violent extremism is aimed at preventing that sort of thing from occurring. It’s done through a variety of outreach and education programs, social media and other efforts, aiming to get down to the local and even the individual level -- such as showing parents how to spot whether a son or daughter might be becoming radicalized. ""The more local it is, the more successful it’s going to be,"" Pate told us. Indeed, the White House strategy document, issued in 2011, outlines how the federal government will ""support and help empower American communities and their local partners in their grassroots efforts to prevent violent extremism."" The White House also said, in February 2015, that ""communities provide the solution to violent extremism; and CVE efforts are best pursued at the local level, tailored to local dynamics, where local officials continue to build relationships within their communities through established community policing and community outreach mechanisms. The federal government’s most effective role in strengthening community partnerships and preventing violent extremism is as a facilitator, convener, and source of research and findings."" In other words, unlike auditing federal tax returns, which is done at the federal level, countering violent extremism has a federal component but is designed to be an effort that is spread out throughout the country. To back McSally’s statement on the two dozen federal workers, her office cited a statement made at a July 2015 congressional hearing by U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. He said:   ""Our committee asked the top agencies responsible for (countering violent extremism) how much money and how many people they have assigned to the problem. They could only identify around $15 million being spent and around two dozen people working full-time to combating domestic radicalization. That’s it."" The four primary federal entities for countering violent extremism are the departments of Homeland Security and Justice, the FBI and the National Counter-Terrorism Center. But McSally and McCaul are counting only the number of full-time federal employees in those agencies whose work is dedicated solely to countering violent extremism. Pate told us that ignores the many other employees from the four entities that spend least part of their time on countering violent extremism -- as well as countless other people across the country, including local law enforcement, community groups and individuals. Our rating McSally said the U.S. has ""10,000 IRS agents making sure that you don't take an improper charity deduction,"" but to fight terrorism, it has ""less than two dozen people focusing on countering violent extremism at home.""   There are 10,000 IRS revenue agents who examine and audit tax returns -- a much broader scope of work than merely checking for an improper deduction. And there’s an indication that as of mid-2015, strictly speaking, perhaps two dozen federal employees were focused solely on countering violent extremism. But that effort involves more federal employees who do at least some work on countering violent extremism, as well as people in local communities across the country who are involved. We rate McSally’s statement Mostly False. More on homeland security Rand Paul in Milwaukee: 40 percent of illegal immigrants ""had a visa and then became illegal,"" mostly because ""they changed jobs."" Half True. In Context: What Scott Walker said about a Canada wall. Ron Johnson: Some 8.1 million of the estimated 11 million to 12 million people ""in this country illegally are working.""

NC GOP mostly wrong about Cooper's approval rating
","North Carolina’s Roy Cooper enters a re-election year as one of only three Democratic governors in the South. Cooper also leads the only state where the governor and legislature didn’t agree on a full budget for fiscal year 2020. The state House and Senate passed a budget in late June. But Cooper vetoed it just days later, saying it didn’t do enough for education and health care.  The state House voted to override Cooper’s veto on Sept. 11, but the Senate hasn’t been able to wrangle the votes. Now, the North Carolina Republican Party is saying Cooper’s budget veto significantly affected his approval ratings. Cooper faces Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Forest in the November election. ""Radical (Gov. Cooper) has seen his approval rating plummet after refusing to give teachers their raises or increasing ed funding while holding the state hostage over expanding Obamacare,"" the NC GOP tweeted on Feb. 25. The tweet includes misleading information about the governor’s stance on education and why he vetoed the budget. But, since we’ve previously addressed a claim about the reasoning behind Cooper’s veto, we’re going to focus on his approval ratings.  Is it true that they have plummeted? PolitiFact and WRAL reviewed multiple polls conducted before and after Cooper vetoed the budget on June 28.  The word plummet means to ""drop sharply and abruptly,"" or ""drop straight down at a high rate of speed."" Most polls show a very slight dip, if any at all.  Experts who spoke with PolitiFact said use of the word ""plummet"" in this case exaggerates what poll numbers show about Cooper, who they say is generally in good shape for an incumbent facing re-election.  When we reached out to the NC GOP, its digital director Sasha Duncan pointed us to polling from Civitas Institute, a conservative think tank in North Carolina. Duncan pointed out that Cooper’s approval rating dropped from 58 percent in March 2019 to 51 percent between Oct. 15-17, when the poll was conducted. The same survey showed Cooper’s disapproval rating rising by 6 percentage points, from 29 percent in March to 35 percent in October. There are a couple reasons the Civitas poll doesn’t support the GOP’s tweet: Civitas is only one polling group, and experts say multiple polls are needed to properly gauge a change in attitudes. It showed a 7 percentage point drop in the survey that has a 4 percent margin of error, which most experts would not consider to be a dramatic fall. ""I would say that, generally, movements of less than 10 percent would not be considered ‘significant,’"" said David McLennan, director of the Meredith College Poll. The Civitas polling results were unveiled and discussed at an event in October, according to the Carolina Journal newspaper. At the event, Institute President Donald Bryson said Cooper’s approval drop was ""nothing for him to complain about."" ""That’s where an incumbent would want to be late in the year before an election year. But it’s still something to watch,"" Bryson said. Kaye Usry, assistant director of the Elon Poll, said Cooper’s approval rating suffered a ""slight drop"" between the March and October Civitas polls. ""There is certainly a downward trend in his overall approval rating, but it is slight,"" Usry said. As for the reason behind the drop? Usry and Jason Husser, the Elon Poll’s director, agreed that there’s little hard evidence to tie the ratings drop to the budget stalemate.  ""A decline along these lines could be driven by the budget stalemate, but it seems more likely that it would be driven by the campaign season calendar and that Cooper now has a general election opponent running a campaign against him,"" Husser said. What do other polls show? Much smaller dips. North Carolina is home to several reputable polling universities and organizations. Meredith College polls show that Cooper’s approval rating fell 3.5 percentage points from 48.6 percent in October to 45.1 percent in February, McLennan said. Their margin of error was 3 points, he added. Polls conducted by High Point University found Cooper’s approval rating to be 40 percent in February, 40 percent in November, and 41 percent approval in April. Raleigh-based Public Policy Polling has consistently found Cooper’s approval rating in the 45-to-50 percent range, said Tom Jensen, the group’s director. PPP found Cooper’s approval rating to be 40 percent in June and 45 percent in October, he said. ""I would consider a 7 point drop to be pretty significant if it was showing up in polling across the board, but it’s not,"" Jenson said in an email. ""And even if you did drop from 58% approval to 51% approval, that’s something most politicians these days would take in a second!"" J. Miles Coleman, associate editor of Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball politics blog, agreed with Jensen’s assessment that Cooper is in a good position. He pointed to surveys conducted by MorningConsult at the beginning of 2019 and the end of the year.  The margin of error in the Morning Consult polls is only 1 percent. Cooper had an approval rating of 49 percent at the beginning of the year and 47 percent at the end of the year. Cooper’s disapproval ratings, meanwhile, started at 28 percent and ended at 32 percent. By contrast, Coleman said one-term NC Gov. Bev Perdue started 2012 with a disapproval rate of 48 percent and ended the year at 59 percent disapproval. She didn’t seek reelection.  ""That type of double-digit negative movement would qualify as 'plummeting,’"" Coleman said of Perdue’s numbers. The Crystal Ball blog currently considers the race to be ""leaning"" in Cooper’s favor, he added. The NC GOP tweeted that Cooper’s approval rating has ""plummeted"" and, as evidence, they cited polls from a conservative think tank. But there are several reasons the GOP’s claim is inaccurate. The GOP cited a poll showed a 7-point dip, which experts don’t consider significant. Other polls show Cooper’s approval rating as stable. And experts, including the president of a conservative think tank, believe Cooper is in good position. The tweet exaggerated the reality of Cooper’s polling numbers.

Trump wrongly said insurance companies will waive co-pays for coronavirus treatments
","As coronavirus cases multiply in the United States, one concern Americans have is what they can expect to pay if they seek treatment.  Speaking from the White House, President Donald Trump suggested that people with health insurance shouldn’t have to worry about that. ""Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of the health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments, and to prevent surprise medical billing,"" Trump said March 11. We found that’s an exaggeration at best. We contacted spokespeople for the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services seeking clarification and did not get a response. But in an appearance March 12 on CNN, Vice President Mike Pence said insurers have agreed to waive copays for coronavirus tests — not treatment.  The telecast of Trump’s March 10 meeting with the insurance industry shows that, in fact, company leaders agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus tests — not treatments. ""All the insurance companies here — either today or before today — have agreed to waive all copays on coronavirus testing and extend coverage for coronavirus treatment in all of their benefit plans,"" Pence said. That’s a big distinction. For one thing, a shortage in diagnostic supplies means that many people aren’t receiving tests. You have to present symptoms to qualify. If you don’t receive a test, but do get screened, that qualifies as a doctor’s visit — not a coronavirus test. That qualifies for a copay. ""It’s not even waiving copays or deductibles for services you need to get tests — emergency visits, doctors, etc.,"" noted Sabrina Corlette, a professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute. ""It’s ‘we’ll waive copays for the tests,’ which is the lab service."" Health plans will cover treatment for coronavirus, including hospital stays, said Kristine Grow, a spokeswoman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, a major lobbying group. But they won’t necessarily waive copays or cost-sharing for that treatment. And there are other nuances to getting treatment that might entail higher cost-sharing. If a coronavirus diagnosis ultimately means a patient needs to be put in a private room, or some other form of isolation, that’s a service that costs more. And even if it’s covered, patients could end up paying part of the price out-of-pocket, Corlette said. For surprise medical bills, it’s trickier. There is a lot insurance plans can do, such as waiving in-network cost-sharing when someone gets treatment for the coronavirus, or agreeing to change their benefit structure if a patient gets care from someone out of network. But they don’t appear to have explicitly committed to doing those things, Corlette said. And the responsibility for surprise billing doesn’t just fall on insurance companies, said Zack Cooper, a health economist at Yale University, who studies surprise billing. Doctors and hospitals who are out-of-network are still able to balance bill — that is, send patients a bill for whatever insurance has not paid.  Plus, big insurance companies are only part of the picture. About 61% of Americans with employer-sponsored health care have what is called a ""self-insured"" plan. Those plans, which are regulated by federal law,  can opt out of the agreements around copayments. With all those caveats, Corlette said, Trump’s assertion is ""misleading."" The statements released by health insurance companies about waived costs are not as comprehensive as Trump indicated.  UnitedHealthcare announced that it has ""waived all member cost sharing, including copays, coinsurance and deductibles, for COVID-19 diagnostic testing provided at approved locations in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for all commercial insured, Medicaid and Medicare members. UnitedHealthcare is also supporting self-insured customers choosing to implement similar actions."" Ethan Slavin, a spokesman for Aetna, gave a similar response: He said the company will waive associated costs for members who get tested ""at any authorized location."" Anthem announced March 6 that it would provide coverage of the coronavirus screening test at no out-of-pocket-cost. But again, those commitments are not comprehensive. The statement by UnitedHealthcare doesn’t state that they are waiving all cost-sharing with respect to all emergency treatment or post stabilization, for example. ""The only place you can get tested in a lot of communities is still the hospital emergency room department, so that’s an emergency visit,"" said Sara Rosenbaum, a George Washington University professor of health law and policy. While the White House meeting shows that at the moment health insurance companies have agreed to not charge copays for the tests, the rules could change rapidly for other costs, said Thomas Miller, an expert on health care policy at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""Looking over the horizon we are going to be doing a lot of things differently,"" he said. Joseph Antos, another health care expert at AEI, said that since the final bills for treatment are settled after the patient has been treated, that allows negotiation or other consideration for patients who can’t cover what could be very high cost-sharing amounts in full. ""Most higher income people with good insurance should be able to deal with those costs and should not expect additional discounts related to coronavirus,"" he said. It’s also possible that Congress will decide to pass surprise billing legislation given the circumstances. Trump said the health insurance industry has ""agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments."" This isn’t what those companies said. They agreed to waive copayments for coronavirus testing. That’s only one component, and it’s a far cry from waiving copayments for all treatment. And, despite what the president’s phrasing may imply, the Americans who seek a test and are turned away will not have their copayments waived either. Patients who seek testing for coronavirus, and even those who end up needing treatment, will likely still end up facing medical bills. The size and scope depends on their insurance plans, and on what doctors they see. The president’s statement is inaccurate.

(Screenshot from Facebook) After winning big on Super Tuesday and in several state primaries March 10, Biden has emerged as the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination. He has a history of verbal gaffes on the campaign trail, so we wanted to look at each statement in the Facebook post to see if it’s accurate. While some quotes need additional clarification, Biden did say most of them. This checks out.  Biden said this during a campaign stop in Iowa in December. In a video depicting the event, a man confronts Biden about his son’s connection to Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company. ""You’re selling access to the president just like he is,"" the man says in the video. ""You’re a damn liar, man,"" Biden responds. Later in the exchange, Biden challenges the man to do push-ups and says ""look, fat, look, here’s the deal"" while addressing him. He also refers to the man as ""Jack"" and challenges him to an IQ test. This statement is also accurate, but it needs more context. Biden said it during a February campaign event in New Hampshire. In a video of the event, he responds to a woman’s question about his fourth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses. ""How do you explain the performance in Iowa, and why should the voters believe that you can win the national election?"" she asks. ""That’s a good question,"" Biden responds. ""No. 1: Iowa’s a Democratic caucus. You ever been to a caucus? The woman said yes. But Biden didn’t believe her. ""No, you haven’t. You’re a lying dog-faced pony soldier,"" he said. It sounds like an attack, but the audience laughed after Biden made the joke. His campaign said the line — which Biden has used before — comes from a John Wayne movie, but it’s not clear that it does. (Email us if you know the source of the line.) This quote is partially accurate. Biden made the statement before the March 10 Michigan primary while touring a Fiat Chrysler plant in Detroit. A video of the incident shows a man confronting Biden about his stance on gun rights.

""You’re full of s---,"" Biden responds, cutting off a person from the campaign who was trying to stop him, saying ""shush."" ""I support the Second Amendment."" Biden then said he was fine with people owning firearms, but not assault weapons or weapons that shoot ""100 rounds."" What happens next is less clear. Some media outlets first reported that Biden said, ""Don't tell me that, pal, or I'm going to go out and slap you in the face."" But a closer angle of the moment seems to show Biden saying ""I'm going to go outside with you."" Later, Biden says: ""Give me a break, man. Don’t be such a horse’s ass."" A Facebook post lists three times that Biden has allegedly ""attacked voters this primary."" The assertion that Biden said ""look, fat,"" ""old"" and ""you’re a damn liar"" to an Iowa man checks out.

Wisconsin state Sen. Roger Roth hits the mark: Tax burden at a 50-year low
","Is Wisconsin’s tax burden at a 50-year low? That was the claim made by state Sen. Roger Roth, R-Appleton, when he gave the GOP response to Gov. Tony Evers’ 2020 State of the State speech. In the Jan. 22, 2020, speech, Roth touted Republican-backed investments in the state’s infrastructure, worker training and childhood education. The results, he said, are economic growth, low unemployment, higher wages and frozen college tuition without raising taxes.  ""The average resident’s tax burden is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, while incomes continue to grow,"" he said. Is he right? When asked for backup, Roth’s office pointed us to the Wisconsin Policy Forum’s January 2020 report, ""Tax Burden Falls Again."" The report is an annual review of state and local taxes relative to state residents’ income. The Wisconsin Policy Forum is a nonpartisan research organization. The tax burden is the total share of taxes compared to income. The Wisconsin Policy Forum compiles all the state and local taxes in Wisconsin, using a variety of reports, such as the state’s Annual Fiscal Report, and information from state agencies. State and local tax revenue is compared relative to cumulative personal income of all income reported in Wisconsin. Those income numbers are from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The forum’s report shows Wisconsin's tax burden for 2019 was the lowest since at least 1970, which is as far back as the organization has data. State and local taxes, combined, took up 10.3% of residents’ income in 2019, down slightly from 10.4% in 2018. The state has established a new tax burden low each year since 2015. Jason Stein, research director at the Wisconsin Policy Forum, noted that doesn’t necessarily mean everyone is paying 10.3% of their income. Incomes and taxes vary region to region and person to person. Noah Williams, a professor of economics and director of the Center for Research on the Wisconsin Economy, echoed that point and said the policy forum’s approach is a reasonable one to use. The report shows overall tax burden has consistently trended down over the last 50 years, from an average of 14% in the 1970s to 11% across the 2010s. Behind the numbers The drop is not entirely the result of reduced tax collections. Indeed, according to the forum, state and local tax revenues increased by 4.5% in fiscal year 2019 — the most since 2011.  So what’s going on? Well, income has increased faster than average tax collections. Income has been on an upward trend since 2009. The policy forum found income grew by 5.1% in calendar year 2018, the most recent year available at the time of its report. Because income growth outpaced the increase in tax collection, the tax burden decreased. While taxes are determined by state and local governments, many other economic factors help drive income levels, Stein said. ""If the economy’s doing really well, it’s not purely a function of what’s happening at the state level,"" Stein said. ""If it was doing really poorly, it wouldn’t be purely a function of what’s happening at the state level either."" Roth claimed ""the average (Wisconsin) resident’s tax burden is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, while incomes continue to grow.""  The numbers check out. While tax collections are up, incomes have been growing at a faster rate than taxes. Thus, the tax burden continues to edge down. We rate his claim True.

An epidemiologist projects 40%-70% of adults could catch coronavirus in the coming year
","As more people are infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, many are wondering: Am I next?  The odds may not be in our favor, according to a recent Facebook post.  ""Harvard scientists just predicted that it may take many months to find cure for coronavirus,"" the March 10 post says. ""According to them, virus is spreading so fast that it will infect 70% of humanity this year.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Spokespeople for Harvard University did not immediately reply to PolitiFact’s emails asking about the post.  But news stories lend some credence to the Facebook post’s claims — and provide more information that the post fails to mention.  On March 11, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic that has infected nearly 120,000 people worldwide. More than 4,000 people have died and eight countries, including the United States, are currently each reporting more than 1,000 cases. Mark Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics and an expert on viruses, told CBS News, among other news outlets, that 40% to 70% of the world’s adult population could be infected in the coming year.  There are an estimated 7.6 billion people in the world, and an estimated 329 million in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Adults make up about three-quarters of the U.S. population.  ""That is a projection,"" Lipsitch said during the March 2 interview, ""so we will find out if that’s accurate as things go on. It is the best estimate that I’ve been able to make based on a combination of the mathematical models that we use to track and predict epidemics."" Other estimates are similar. The Guardian reported on Feb. 11 that 60% of the global population could be infected if the virus is unchecked. On Feb. 13, Bloomberg reported that Ira Longini, an adviser to the World Health Organization, said two-thirds of the world’s population could catch COVID-19.  But the publication also quoted David Heymann, an infectious disease expert at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, explaining that researchers need more data to get a better idea of how far the coronavirus could spread.  ""The models will be refined as more information comes to light,"" he said.  Our ruling The Facebook post says Harvard scientists say the coronavirus is ""spreading so fast that it will infect 70% of humanity this year.""  An epidemiologist at the university has said that 40% to 70% of the world’s adult population could be infected in the coming year.  But that is a projection, and other projections vary.  We rate this post Half True. ",/factchecks/2020/mar/11/viral-image/epidemiologist-projects-40-70-adults-could-catch-c/

Donald Trump’s wrong claim that ‘anybody’ can get tested for coronavirus
","To show that his administration has been fast and effective in its response to the new coronavirus, President Donald Trump claimed that anybody who wants to get tested for the respiratory disease caused by the virus can do so. ""Anybody that wants a test can get a test. That’s what the bottom line is,"" Trump told reporters March 6 during a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Moments later, Trump added that anybody that needs a test gets one. ""But as of right now and yesterday, anybody that needs a test — that’s the important thing — and the tests are all perfect, like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect, right? This was not as perfect as that, but pretty good,"" Trump said. (Trump’s mention of ""the letter"" and ""transcription"" was a reference to his recent impeachment.) As large public gatherings around the United States are being cancelled and some colleges are suspending in-person classes to avoid the spread of the disease, PolitiFact decided to fact-check Trump on his ""bottom line"" assessment that anybody who wants a test will get one. He’s wrong. Current supply of the test is limited, and it is clinicians who decide whether a patient meets criteria to warrant testing. Testing is not as easy as just calling your doctor or pharmacy, saying you want to be tested for COVID-19 and getting it done. ""Unfortunately, it’s not that simple yet,"" said Christopher Mores, a professor of global health at George Washington University. There is greater availability of tests, but the number of labs involved in the testing process is still limited, Mores said. Testing is expected to increase as more commercial labs participate, but even they have limits in the number of patients that can be tested daily, Mores said. PolitiFact found news reports of people who wanted to get tested and couldn’t, or of hindrances in the testing process. Here’s a sample: CBS Miami reported March 2 that a woman who had returned from Italy was told at a hospital that she likely had COVID-19 but was refused a test. The woman, not named by CBS Miami, said one of the reasons she wasn’t tested for the new coronavirus was because she was not in a high-risk category, since she was in her 30s and otherwise healthy. (She tested positive for earlier coronavirus strains, coronavirus 229E and NL63, according to CBS Miami.) The hospital and state health department did not comment on the case. Texas Tribune reported March 11 that Texas’ largest public health lab can do a maximum of 26 tests per day. Doctors and hospitals did not yet have capability to do tests on their own premises. (An NPR report indicates this issue is not limited to Texas.) The Mercury News reported that the president of the California Academy of Family Physicians said no one had been trained to do the test. (The story published March 7 and was updated March 10.) The CDC on its website said that if people come in close contact of someone with the respiratory disease and they develop symptoms, they should call their health care provider. ""They will decide whether you need to be tested, but keep in mind that there is no treatment for COVID-19, and people who are mildly ill are able to isolate at home,"" the federal health agency said. Elsewhere on its website, the CDC said, ""Clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested.""  Factors to consider for testing include whether individuals were in close contact with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patient within 14 days of symptoms, or if they traveled from affected geographic areas within 14 days of symptom onset.  Clinicians who want to test a patient should work with local and state health departments to coordinate testing through public health labs, CDC said. That process could be delayed if the labs are running at capacity. The CDC is typically the first one to develop a diagnostic test because they have access before others to clinical specimens and viral samples. The CDC test then becomes the basis for tests developed by others. But there were manufacturing problems with the CDC test at first. Trump administration officials have provided conflicting information regarding how many people can be tested. Stephen M. Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, acknowledged the confusion on March 7. Hahn said that production issues were eventually resolved by a third-party manufacturer. That manufacturer is producing tests for state public health labs, academic medical centers, community hospitals and other nonpublic health labs. The CDC has shipped tests to public health laboratories to test about 75,000 people, Hahn said. Additionally, 1.1 million tests were shipped to nonpublic health labs, and around 1 million more tests were close to being shipped, he said. But the number of tests shipped doesn’t equal the number of people that can be tested. For instance, 2.1 million tests would roughly translate to testing for 850,000 Americans, according to Hahn. Manufacturers plan to scale up production so they can ship 4 million more tests by mid March, Hahn said, and large commercial and academic labs are also expected to make more tests. Trump said, ""Anybody that wants a test can get a test."" This is wrong. It is health care providers who make the call on who gets tested, based on recommendations from the CDC. There’s an increase in the number of tests being manufactured, but an increase in the availability of tests does not mean that ""anybody that wants a test can get a test.""  Trump’s statement is inaccurate and a gross oversimplification of the facts.

Drinking water does not prevent coronavirus infection
","Drinking water is one of the primary ways to treat viral infections. But could it also prevent infections from the 2019 coronavirus?  Health experts say no.

The post includes a diagram of a lung and a long paragraph of medical advice attributed to ""Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases."" ""Even if the virus gets into your mouth … drinking water or other liquids will WASH them down through your esophagus and into the stomach,"" the photo reads. ""Once there in tummy … your stomach ACID will kill all the virus. If you don’t drink enough water more regularly … the virus can enter your windpipes and into the LUNGS."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared hundreds of times. (Screenshot from Facebook) A good rule of thumb is that if an online medical cure sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Such is the case with this Facebook post, which has been debunked by several other media outlets. While health experts recommend drinking water regularly to stay healthy, there is no evidence that sipping some every 15 minutes can help prevent coronavirus infection.  The primary way the virus spreads is through close contact with infected people and respiratory droplets, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When someone with the coronavirus coughs or sneezes, their germs land on surfaces around them. The virus then infects people who touch those surfaces and then their eyes, nose and mouth. So to prevent contracting the coronavirus, the CDC advises people to avoid touching their face as much as possible. Other ways to prevent infection include washing your hands with soap and water, covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and regularly sanitizing the surfaces in your home or at your workstation. As of now, there is no specific treatment for the virus. In a tweet published Feb. 7, the World Health Organization in the Philippines said it does not advise people to drink water as a way to avoid coronavirus infection.

No, coronavirus has not yet ‘officially reached Milwaukee County,’ contrary to politician's claim
","On the day coronavirus was officially declared a pandemic and the University of Wisconsin-Madison moved all classes online, state Sen. Chris Larson issued a news release responding to the ""first coronavirus case in Milwaukee County."" Just one problem. The county has no confirmed cases. An employee at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Foundation was tested for the disease Monday, March 9, 2020, after falling ill following contact with a person who traveled to a country with a Level 3 warning. The school released that information a day later, noting test results were expected at the end of the week. But Larson, D-Milwaukee, skipped the waiting-for-results part.  He sent out a release March 11, 2020, announcing, ""The coronavirus has officially reached Milwaukee County."" Larson is running for county executive, a role in which he would oversee — among many other things — many people and agencies with key roles combatting the virus. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported officials with the Milwaukee County Jail, House of Correction, the county Behavior Health Division facility, the airport, and the zoo are among those on a weekly conference call discussing the local coronavirus response. While health officials around the country have said the virus is a great concern, they have also warned about overreaction and misinformation Live coronavirus updates: Milwaukee Journal Sentinel blog When asked about the wording of the news release, Larson campaign manager Sonja Chojnacki said it was a reference to ""the possible case that’s being reported on."" She said she was not aware of any positive tests. Larson’s campaign sent out an amended news release referencing the ""potential coronavirus case at UWM"" after being questioned by the Journal Sentinel.  A positive test is hardly a foregone conclusion. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services is no longer releasing data on the number of people tested, but it reported only two of the first 46 tests came back positive. At the time Larson’s original news release went out, Wisconsin had three confirmed coronavirus cases. Two of those — in Dane County and Pierce County — were reported in the days before Larson’s release. The state notes one of those has already recovered. Larson, a state senator running for Milwaukee County executive, sent out a news release calling for action because coronavirus had ""officially reached Milwaukee County."" But that’s sloppy at best. To this point, no coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the county. Larson’s staff confirmed they were referencing a UWM Foundation employee who at that point had only been tested. The number of tests and cases are growing, so the situation in Milwaukee County will certainly change. But we rate statements based on what is known at the time they were made.

In a statement published March 6, Charlotte Petri Gornitzka, UNICEF’s deputy executive director for partnerships, addressed some misinformation about the coronavirus, including the fake handout. ""A recent erroneous online message circulating in several languages around the world and purporting to be a UNICEF communication appears to indicate, among other things, that avoiding ice cream and other cold foods can help prevent the onset of the disease,"" she wrote. ""This is, of course, wholly untrue. To the creators of such falsehoods, we offer a simple message: STOP."" There is ample evidence that viruses, including human coronaviruses, don’t like heat.

Trump said Bloomberg polled poorly in tough times, but that's not always true
","President Donald Trump ridiculed Michael Bloomberg on Twitter, saying New Yorkers didn’t approve of how he performed as New York City mayor during tough times.  ""Ever since (Mini Mike) Bloomberg’s bad debate performances, his support has dropped,"" Trump tweeted. ""Dropped a lot. Only his highly paid consultants, who are laughing all the way to the bank, still support him...And by the way, he did not poll well as mayor in handling crisis!""   Bloomberg made his leadership skills a significant part of his argument for why voters should have considered him for the White House, so we wondered about the president’s criticism. Even though Bloomberg has dropped out of the presidential contest, he has said he will spend money to defeat Trump, and Trump has continued to feud with him on Twitter.   We checked with the Trump campaign, and Deputy Communications Director Zach Parkinson sent us several examples of times when Bloomberg’s approval rating suffered in times of crisis. We also looked for examples. They include: 2009: During a nationwide economic crisis, Bloomberg’s approval ratings dipped, according to a Marist Poll. The poll also found that 46 city voters disapproved and 43 percent approved of his handling of the crisis.     2011: Fifty-one percent of city voters disapproved of the way Bloomberg handled Occupy Wall Street protestors, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.  2011: Bloomberg’s approval rating dropped after he was widely criticized for his handling of a snowstorm, and 71 percent of voters disapproved of his response to the storm, according to a Marist/NY1 poll.   The polls, however, were not all bad for Bloomberg in the aftermath of trying times: 2003: Fifty-nine percent of voters approved of the way Bloomberg handled a blackout, though in the same New York Times/CBS poll, only 32 percent of voters approved of his overall job as mayor.  2011: Bloomberg’s approval ratings rose 11 points following his handling of Hurricane Irene, and 86 percent of voters approved of his handling of Irene readiness, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.  2012: In the last year as mayor, 75 percent of New York City voters said Bloomberg had done an excellent or good job in responding to Hurricane Sandy, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.  It should be noted how Bloomberg came into the mayor’s office. As a candidate, Bloomberg seemed like a longshot on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, the day in which the city was to hold its primary election. But during the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, his popularity rose, and he narrowly won the general election. The 2001 mayor’s race could have hinged on many factors, not least of which that Bloomberg vastly outspent his rival, Democrat Mark Green.  The Bloomberg campaign did not respond to emails about this fact-check. Bloomberg, however,  laid out his case for his experience handling crises as mayor in a television ad filmed in late February. The ad highlighted his experience dealing with the aftermath of Sept. 11, the blackout of 2003, West Nile virus, and Hurricane Sandy.   Bloomberg has also expressed his ambivalence about polls in the past, telling The Atlantic magazine in 2012, ""If I finish my term in office … and have high approval ratings, then I wasted my last years in office. That high approval rating means you don’t upset anybody.""  Trump tweeted that Bloomberg ""did not poll well as mayor in handling crisis!""  Sometimes Bloomberg’s approval ratings fell when the city faced tough times, sometimes they didn't. Voters disapproved of his handling of a big snowstorm, Occupy Wall Street protestors and a financial crisis. Voters, however, approved of how he handled recovery efforts after Sept. 11, managed the city during a blackout and responded to some major storms.  We rate this claim Half True. ",/factchecks/2020/mar/11/donald-trump/trump-said-bloomberg-polled-poorly-tough-times-s-n/

No connection between the US national elections and international pandemics
","As coronavirus misinformation spreads like wildfire, there have been conspiratorial attempts to connect the disease to election year politics. Many tweets and Facebook posts are making the false claim that there is a trend of disease outbreaks matched to elections. ""Every election year has a disease,"" reads one. The posts connect SARS to 2004, avian flu to 2008, swine flu to 2010, MERS to 2012, Ebola to 2014 and 2018, Zika to 2016, and the coronavirus to 2020.  ""Coincidences? NEVER.""  One post we saw supposedly linked to the World Health Organization (WHO), but that lead to a 404 error page.  Our research showed that most of these connections weren’t real. We decided to take a closer look and see if the diseases were significant enough to appear in party platforms or mentioned during candidate interviews. In most cases, they weren’t.  Online, fact-based news is going to be very important in the coming weeks. Please consider donating to PolitiFact today.  SARS is a coronavirus disease that spread from animals to humans and was diagnosed in China in 2003. SARS is a respiratory illness that affects breathing and is usually associated with coughing and a fever. It is spread through infected droplets that can survive on surfaces and could affect you if airborne.  The SARS outbreak was stopped by July 2003, and in 2004 China took precautions by putting an embargo on animals that could have been the source of the disease.  SARS affected eight people in the United States, and all these cases were contracted from travel abroad. SARS did not spread within the United States during the 2003 outbreak, and there have been no cases reported since then. SARS wasn’t a main campaign point in the 2004 presidential elections. It was referenced once in the Republican Party platform that was released in August 2004, under a section on international diplomacy that mentioned it as a joint concern of the United States and China.  Avian flu is usually found in aquatic birds and poultry, but in rare cases the influenza can cross over and infect humans. The symptoms of avian flu are like general influenza, including cough, fever, sore throat or headaches.  The two most prevalent avian influenza viruses, H5N1 and H9N2, caused respiratory infections in humans in China as early as the 1990s. Vietnam, Indonesia, China, Egypt, Thailand, and many other countries struggled with the spread of H5N1 from 2004 to 2014. In 2014, there was only one case of H5N1 in North America, according to the CDC, and there were never any U.S. cases. As far as the 2008 presidential campaign is concerned, the Democratic Party platform mentioned avian flu briefly to justify strengthening international support systems.  Nevertheless, the avian flu was a pandemic before the 2008 presidential election and has continued to be a problem even today, with new strains appearing as recently as 2017. The 2008 strain of the influenza had no significant influence on elections that we could determine.  The swine flu, more specifically H1N1, started spreading in early 2009 and combined avian, swine, and human influenza in one new strain. The symptoms of the disease are like most flu symptoms, including a fever, chills, cough, sore throat, or a runny or stuffy nose. It also spreads like most influenza, with infected droplets that could be airborne or left on surfaces. The 2009 swine flu outbreak was the ""first global flu pandemic in 40 years,"" according to the CDC. The panic surrounding swine flu led to many extreme measures, including school shutdowns and people camping outside of free swine flu vaccine centers. But not everyone approved of the vaccine.  PolitiFact checked a statement from October 2009 by Glenn Beck, a conservative talk show host who was against the swine flu vaccination. He believed the vaccine would lead to neurological problems like that of an influenza vaccine from the 1970s. We rated his statement Mostly False.  Swine flu was a politically polarizing disease when it came to vaccinating and expanding the government’s health budget to prevent more outbreaks. It affected Americans directly and led to preventative legislation, but we found no examples of representatives using H1N1 in their campaigns during the 2010 midterm elections. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, is a viral respiratory illness that was first found in dromedary (or one-humped) camels and then spread to humans. Most cases of the disease came from direct or in-direct contact with camels.  Human-to-human transmission of MERS is more rare and mostly appears in unsanitary health care settings. Symptoms of the disease include fever, coughing, or trouble with breathing that can lead to pneumonia.  MERS was first diagnosed in Saudi Arabia in 2012, according to the CDC. All cases of MERS in 2012 were within the Arabian Peninsula, with two unlinked cases only reaching the U.S. in 2014.  MERS was not brought up by any campaigns or included in any party platforms in the 2012 presidential election. It didn’t affect the U.S. until 2014, and even then the only comment was from press secretary Jay Carney, when he said at a press conference that President Barack Obama had ""been briefed"" on the MERS developments. Even though MERS did occur during the 2012 election, it didn’t seem to have any effect on U.S. politics. The Ebola virus emerged periodically and caused outbreaks in many African countries as early as 1995. Ebola is introduced into the human population when there is close contact with the bodily fluids of infected fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope or porcupines. Human-to-human transmission only occurs when touching infected human bodily fluids or objects that have touched infected human bodily fluids.  The first signs of Ebola include fever, fatigue, or a sore throat. Later, the infected person will experience vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function. In the most deadly cases, there is internal and external bleeding. The first large outbreaks were in 1995 and 2000 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda, according to the CDC’s timeline.  The CDC also documented only four diagnosed Ebola cases in the U.S. in 2014, and only two of the Ebola patients were infected in the U.S. In 2018, there were only outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. In 2014, an NPR report broke down how Ebola was used by both Democrats and Republicans.  Democrats would use Ebola to ""argue that budget-cutting Republicans have deprived the government of the resources it needs to keep Americans safe."" Republicans used the government’s reaction to Ebola as an example of President Obama’s ""incompetence"" and linked Ebola to border security.  In contrast, Ebola was not a topic in the 2018 election because Ebola was only concentrated in two African countries and had a very low chance of coming to the U.S. again, according to the Association of Health Care Journalists. Ebola was not a huge threat to Americans in the United States despite some cases in 2014, but it was used as a political tool in the 2014 midterm elections. Comparatively, there were no cases of Ebola in 2018 in the United States, and it was not used as rhetoric in the elections. Zika is spread mostly through the bite of infected mosquitoes, but can also be transmitted through unprotected sex. The most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, headache, joint and muscle pain, and red eyes (conjunctivitis). While Zika has a low death rate, it became a larger issue when it was linked to fetal brain defects in infected pregnant women’s children.  Outbreaks of the Zika virus have been reported in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands since 1952, according to the CDC. It began to appear more in the United States in 2015 and 2016 because of people travelling from tropical climates and from local mosquitos in Texas and Florida. In 2016, the Zika outbreak hit a peak, with 5,168 symptomatic Zika virus disease cases reported in the U.S., according to the CDC’s 2016 report. Zika sowed division in an already divided Senate but didn’t impact the presidential race. President Obama’s administration asked Congress ""for more than $1.8 billion in emergency funding to enhance… efforts to prepare for and respond to the Zika virus"" in February 2016.  It took almost seven months for Congress to approve a federal spending bill to prevent the Zika virus from spreading. The New York Times reported that they voted to advance the funding, despite disagreements between Republicans and Democrats on where the funding should come from. A month later, the bill had fallen apart, with the Democrats rejecting provisions added by the Republicans. Finally, the bill passed on Sept. 28, 2016, with concessions made by both sides. During this congressional tug of war, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both brought up the Zika virus only once during their campaigns. When Trump was asked about how he would deal with the Zika virus while he campaigned in Florida, he said that Rick Scott, the state’s Republican governor, was doing a great job and ""he's going to have it under control, he probably already does."" Clinton urged Congress to pass a spending bill and ""called for more public education about the virus’ dangers, the development of a rapid diagnostic test, investment in treatment and a vaccine, better mosquito control and abatement, and improved access to health and family planning services."" While the Zika virus had an impact on Americans in 2016 and showed how divided the Senate was, we found little impact on the 2016 presidential election. The 2019 Novel Coronavirus, or COVID-19, is a respiratory disease that has symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. It is spread by airborne respiratory droplets that are released when an infected person coughs or sneezes and can also be spread by touching surfaces that droplets have landed on. Like it says in the name, COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It has spread across the world as people traveled to and from China. There are now 647 cases in the U.S. as of March 10, 2020. As COVID-19 has spread in the United States, Congress and President Donald Trump have approved funding to create a vaccine and prevent a pandemic. On March 6, 2020, Trump signed an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill.  This time, the virus has been a major point of discussion for the president and other presidential candidates.  A post on social media says ""Every election year has a disease"" ...

Some of the diseases never impacted the United States, and never came up as a large point in a campaign. There is some evidence that Ebola in 2014 impacted the election, but otherwise there is no straightforward connection between national U.S. elections and pandemics. The post is not accurate.

Foxconn progress is slow, but Gwen Moore is wrong expecting 13,000 jobs already
","Foxconn Technology Group was awarded a record-shattering volume of tax credits amid pledges to build a $10 billion high-tech complex in Mount Pleasant that could eventually employ up to 13,000 people. The project, announced in 2017, has been slow to develop, to say the least. Among other signs: The latest jobs report from 2018 showed just over 100 jobs eligible for tax credits (2019 figures aren’t out yet).  A timeline attached to the state credit application called for $2.1 billion in construction spending at the end of 2019. Foxconn has so far awarded about $370 million in contracts. The company has abandoned plans to build the latest ""Generation 10.5"" screens as originally promised in favor of a ""Generation 6"" plant. U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wisconsin, is getting impatient. ""(President Donald) Trump promised 13,000 new jobs to the people of #Wisconsin,"" she tweeted Feb. 14, 2020. ""3 years later, we’re still waiting…"" Moore raises Trump’s role in the process, while also implying those 13,000 jobs are overdue. We checked out both elements of her claim. Trump has played a high-profile role throughout the Foxconn project. After a series of media reports raised the specter Foxconn might scale back or even suspend its Wisconsin plans, Trump spoke with then-CEO and Chairman Terry Gou. The company then announced in February 2019 it was still building a liquid crystal display manufacturing plant in Wisconsin. Trump had also been present for the groundbreaking in June 2018, where he said this: ""Moments ago we broke ground on a plant that will provide jobs for much more than 13,000 Wisconsin workers,"" the president said. ""Really something."" He tweeted the same day that the plant ""will provide jobs for up to 15,000 Wisconsin Workers."" It’s fair for Moore to summarize this as promising 13,000 jobs, since Trump made these claims without attribution or qualification. Moore’s ""still waiting"" claim doesn’t fare so well. Her phrasing implies the jobs should have been here three years ago, or at the very least should by now. That was never the promise. A memorandum of understanding between Foxconn and the state in July 2017 said the company ""agrees to … create up to 13,000 jobs with an estimated average salary of $53,875 over a period of up to six years."" The formal agreement signed in November 2017 moved that up a bit, saying Foxconn agrees ""to the best of their ability, to projected employment of 13,000 jobs of hourly and salaried personnel of Wisconsin payroll between 2018 and the end of 2022."" It goes on to note the headcount is subject to timely construction and ""business needs."" When it comes to qualifying to get the tax credits, the timeline is a bit looser than that. Foxconn would need 13,000 jobs by 2022 to get the maximum available tax credits from the state, according to a credit disbursement schedule attached to the agreement. But that document also shows a minimum number of jobs needed to get some level of state credits, and that requires 5,200 jobs by 2022. That minimum threshold tops out at 10,400 in 2027, so Foxconn could get some level of incentives each year without ever reaching 13,000 jobs. The actual jobs count for Foxconn isn’t currently available. The company is required to report jobs for the prior year to the state by each April 1, and they have not yet reported 2019 figures. For 2018, Foxconn reported 189 jobs at the end of the year, of which 113 were deemed eligible for tax credits by the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. The company declined to provide a specific jobs number to PolitiFact Wisconsin, simply noting that Foxconn has so far ""invested millions of dollars in Wisconsin while hiring hundreds of hardworking Foxconn employees."" For maximum tax credits, Foxconn had to have 1,040 employees at the end of 2018 and 2,080 at the end of 2019. Moore said Trump promised 13,000 new jobs, and ""we’re still waiting"" three years later. She’s right that Trump referred to the jobs figure in what could reasonably be called a promise. But she’s off base with the impatient tone that implies those jobs are somehow overdue. The earliest date that could be seen as a deadline for 13,000 jobs is 2022, since Foxconn said in the state agreement it would seek to hire that many in that timeframe. While Foxconn’s progress has been slow, it’s not fair to claim we should be at 13,000 jobs by now. We rate Moore’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2020/mar/11/gwen-moore/foxconn-progress-slow-gwen-moore-wrong-expecting-1/
