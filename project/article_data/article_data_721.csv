They both like expensive jets, but Creflo Dollar did not endorse Donald Trump
","Well, they both like expensive jets. A new round of reports blazed across the internet again recently with this unlikely premise: Flamboyant Pastor Creflo Dollar of metro Atlanta -- who once tried to raise $65 million from his flock to buy a top-of-the-line Gulfstream  jet -- has endorsed Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump. The reports first surfaced a month or so back, died down and reignited recently as the campaign rhetoric between forces backing Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, well, escalated. Several readers have asked PolitiFact Georgia to take a look. We did, and what we got was an education on how misinformation -- or just plain made-up ""news"" --  is spread loud, and, like Jason in the ""Halloween"" movies,  comes howling back to life even after it is disproven. Dollar is an internationally known American televangelist and pastor of the nondenominational World Changers Church International, which is based in College Park, a suburb south of Atlanta. A year or so back, Dollar and other leaders at World Changers Church International launched Project G650. The goal: Raise nearly $65 million for a  luxury jet, largely from $300-plus donations from 200,000 of the faithful. One rationale given for buying the aircraft was that the church needed to be able to carry thousands of pounds of food and other goods to other parts of the world. Trouble is, the plane is designed to carry billionaires and their golf clubs, not large quantities of relief supplies. That food/relief argument never got off the runway, and PolitiFact Georgia gave Dollar a Pants on Fire rating. As PolitiFact quickly discovered, the Dollar-endorses-Trump rumor also crashes and burns. This time around, Dollar was the target of a satirical online site The Biz Standard News (as in BS News), which first ""reported"" in late May that Dollar was endorsing Trump. This is how the Standard defines its own site: ""The Business Standard News is a satirical site designed to parody the 24-hour news cycle. The stories are outlandish, but reality is so strange nowadays they could be true."" The Standard piece quoted the pastor as saying: ""God came to me in a dream last night and said that Trump is his chosen candidate. God apologized for the mixed messages he was sending. I now know that Trump has been touched by the hand of God."" The piece also had Dollar comparing Trump to the biblical figure John the Baptist. The initial piece of satire received little attention. But then a legitimate online news site,  WordOnDaStreet.com, mistook this fake story as real news and two months ago rehashed the article on its website. It was quickly picked up by numerous other media outlets and went viral. Soon, there were YouTube videos -- all fake -- purporting to show Dollar’s support for Trump. Dollar, meanwhile, refuted the reports, writing on his Facebook site Aug. 25 that he has endorsed no one in the race for president. The post stated: ""At World Changers Church International, I nor the ministry endorse any political party or candidate; nor do we advise our members who to vote for. Any reports stating that I have endorsed Donald Trump for President are false. I have not endorsed any candidate and do not plan to."" Snopes.com, the site known for sniffing out bogus reports, also looked at the Dollar-Trump endorsement and found it to be flatly false. Our ruling Social media sites have buzzed with the ""news"" that metro Atlanta Pastor Creflo Dollar has endorsed Trump. Those reports are based on a satirical news site. A parody on that site was picked up as legitimate news and went viral. Dollar has dissed the reports as categorically untrue. Which they are. We rate the reports Pants on Fire.   https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a48cab2e-8372-4b1c-b664-df4e586073df","[('Christian Times article on Creflo Dollar', 'http://www.christiantimes.com/article/creflo-dollar-denies-endorsing-donald-trump-saying-god-told-him-trump-was-his-chosen-candidate/61746.htm'), ('WordOnDaStreet \xa0article on Creflo Dollar', 'No link'), ('Business Standard site', 'http://wordondastreet.com/creflo-dollar-says-god-told-endorse-donald-trump-god-apologized-trumps-mixed-messages/'), ('Creflo Dollar’s \xa0Facebook page', 'No link'), ('YouTube video on Creflo Dollar ""endorsement""', 'http://wordondastreet.com/creflo-dollar-says-god-told-endorse-donald-trump-god-apologized-trumps-mixed-messages/'), ('YouTube video on Creflo Dollar', 'No link'), ('YouTube video denying Dollar endorsement', 'https://www.facebook.com/CrefloDollarMinistries/photos/a.10150127570434430.296956.72063929429/10154569901929430/?type=3&theater'), ('YouTube video about Creflo Dollar controversy', 'No link'), ('Snopes.com article on Tump and Dollar', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3_D9Jt0wmM'), ('\xa0', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2016/oct/19/social-media/they-both-expensive-jets-creflo-dollar-did-not-end/

Testing Ron Johnson claim on Russ Feingold, judges and Second Amendment
","U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson took aim at challenger Russ Feingold in a campaign ad on the Second Amendment. In it, Johnson claimed he will protect the rights of gun owners, but Feingold won’t. ""Your right to keep and bear arms, your ability to protect your family is at risk,"" Johnson said in the ad, which was posted online in August 2016. ""Sen. Feingold promises to protect those rights, but that's not what his record shows."" Johnson, a first-term Republican from Oshkosh, is mired in a tight re-election race with Feingold, a Democrat whom Johnson ousted in 2010. While carrying a shotgun in one hand and ammo in the other, Johnson in the ad references the vacant U.S. Supreme Court seat (""One more liberal justice will flip the court"") and says he has ""held firm defending the Second Amendment and will continue to do so."" Not so with Feingold, Johnson claims: ""During his 18-year Senate career, (Feingold) supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right, and he’d do it again if elected to a fourth term."" That last sentence is key because it contains a specific factual assertion that Johnson uses to conclude Feingold would not protect the rights of gun owners — namely that Feingold ""supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right."" Johnson also says that while Feingold ""promises to protect those rights,"" his voting record shows the opposite. But do the facts really support Johnson’s conclusion? Let’s take a look. Confirmation votes and court rulings When asked for backup, a Johnson campaign spokesman cited Feingold’s votes in the Senate to confirm the appointment of three U.S. Supreme Court justices — Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor — who dissented in major gun rights cases. In the 2008 case District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives people an individual right to carry a gun for protection and is not merely a collective right tied to participation in a militia. Breyer and Ginsburg dissented, with Breyer writing he did not think the Second Amendment protects an absolute right to own a gun, but instead ""protects militia-related, not self-defense-related, interests."" (Sotomayor was not yet on the court.) Two years later in McDonald v. City of Chicago, the Supreme Court effectively extended Heller. The court ruled that the Second Amendment, through the 14th Amendment, applies to states just as it does to the federal government. Breyer and Ginsburg dissented here too, as did Sotomayor. (Feingold opposed the appointment of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who cast a majority vote in support of both Heller and McDonald. The remaining Supreme Court justices who participated in those cases were appointed before Feingold became a senator in 1993, except for John Roberts, who is discussed below.) Thus, there is some truth to Johnson’s claim insofar as Feingold voted to appoint three justices who, after being confirmed, disagreed that the Second Amendment gives people an individual right to possess a gun. But here’s what Johnson left out of the ad: Feingold also voted to confirm judges whose decisions have strengthened gun rights. For example: • Feingold voted to confirm Chief Justice Roberts, who voted in the majority of both Heller and McDonald. • Feingold voted to confirm Wisconsin native Diane Sykes as a judge to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In the 2011 case Ezell v. Chicago, Sykes authored a court decision that invalidated a city of Chicago ban on gun ranges within city limits. • Feingold voted to confirm 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Thomas Hardiman, who in 2013 said the Second Amendment should protect an individual’s right to possess a handgun outside the home. • Feingold voted in 2003 to confirm 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Carlos Bea, who earlier this year joined a ruling that found a California county’s ordinance prohibiting gun stores from within 500 feet of residential areas violated the Second Amendment. And while Feingold has said he favors mandating background checks on people buying firearms at gun shows, he also has said he was pleased with the outcome in Heller and he has explicitly expressed support for an individual’s right to own a gun. ""I’ve long believed that the Second Amendment grants citizens a right to own firearms,"" Feingold said in 2010. Our rating In a campaign ad, Johnson said Feingold ""supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right."" Feingold did vote to appoint judges who, after being confirmed, disagreed that the Second Amendment provides for an individual right to possess a gun. But Johnson failed to mention in the ad that Feingold also voted to appoint judges who have issued rulings strengthening gun rights. And Feingold has stated clearly he supports an individual’s right to own a gun. Because Johnson’s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.","[('American Bar Association, ""Teixeira, et. al. v.

In N.C. Senate race, claim by Democrat Deborah Ross against GOP's Richard Burr is misleading
","In a recent campaign ad, North Carolina Democrat Deborah Ross blasted her opponent, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, for voting against the landmark Violence Against Women Act. ""Sen. Burr voted no on the Violence Against Women Act,"" a narrator says in the ad, while the text, ""Richard Burr: Opposed Violence Against Women Act,"" appears on the screen, along with a citation for a bill considered in the Senate in 2012. Here’s a screenshot from the ad:  Is Ross’ ad correct? In part, but it it leaves out important context. What was Burr voting for? First, we should note that the ad used some loose language about what Burr was actually voting on. The 2012 vote referenced in the ad was for a reauthorization bill -- that is, an updating of the existing Violence Against Women Act, which had lapsed in 2011. Burr was not in Congress when the act itself was initially passed in 1994; he was sworn in for his first term in the U.S. House the following year, in 1995. The 2000 and 2005 votes Congress voted to reauthorize the act in both 2000 and 2005, and both legislative efforts were fairly uncontroversial. For the 2000 effort, Burr was in the House, and he voted in favor of the reauthorization, which was passed by the overwhelming margin of 415-3. While that version didn’t become law, another version did become law during that Congress; it passed the House by voice vote. Individual House members’ votes aren’t recorded in a voice vote, but they are usually only held for non-controversial measures. By the time the 2005 reauthorization effort rolled around, Burr had been elected to the Senate. The reauthorization bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent, a process by which senators are given a chance to object to a bill and, if there no objections are made, the bill is deemed passed. So Burr would not have opposed the 2005 reauthorization. The 2012 vote The 2012 reauthorization effort was far more controversial than the previous two, since it involved changes that some social conservatives found objectionable. At the time, the Democrats controlled the presidency and the Senate, while the Republicans controlled the House. The Senate bill would ""allow Indian tribal courts to try certain non-Indians in some cases of domestic violence on reservations, expand the number of temporary visas for illegal immigrants who were victims of domestic violence and extend the protections of that act to gay men and lesbians,"" the New York Times reported at the time. These provisions were anathema to many conservatives, and when faced with a vote on April 26, 2012, Burr was one of 31 Republicans to vote against it, while 15 Republicans voted for it. Overall, the measure passed the chamber by a 60-31 margin. Instead, Burr voted for a failed Republican-sponsored amendment that would have stripped out some of the elements of the bill that were controversial to Republicans. We were unable to find a contemporaneous explanation by Burr on the reason for his vote through Google or Nexis. The only comment he made on the bill to a media outlet came was procedural rather than substantive, when he said that he thought there were more urgent bills for the chamber to prioritize than the reauthorization. Ultimately, the Republican-led House passed a version that omitted the provisions of the Senate bill that conservatives opposed. The House and Senate were unable to come to an agreement, and the measure was dead for the duration of that Congress. It’s worth noting that Politico reported on March 14, 2012, that the Democratic effort to push a vote on the Violence Against Women Act in the spring of 2012 was to make it a ""political weapon."" ""Republicans have several objections to the legislation, but instead of making changes, Schumer wants to fast-track the bill to the floor, let the GOP block it, then allow Democrats to accuse Republicans of waging a ‘war against women,’ "" the Politico story said. ""It’s fodder for a campaign ad, and it’s not the only potential 30-second spot ready to spring from Senate leadership these days."" With this ad, that mission was accomplished. The 2013 vote After the failure to get the two chambers to agree on a single version in 2012, the new Congress took up the effort again in 2013. Partisan control of each part of government remained the same in 2013, and the reauthorization effort played out in a similar fashion. Republicans pursued an amendment to strip out some of the elements they found problematic, such as the provisions related to native Americans and gender identity. On Feb. 7, 2013, the amendment failed by a 34-65 margin, with Burr voting in favor of it. Then, on Feb. 12, 2013, the Senate passed the original measure, 78-22. Burr was among a handful of Republican senators who switched their position and supported the bill. In fact, Burr has subsequently trumpeted elements of this bill. Burr joined with Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., to introduce the Child Protection Compact Act, which was enacted as part of the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization. This provision ""seeks to protect and rescue children from trafficking by creating ‘Child Protection Compacts’ between the United States and countries with significant numbers of children in human trafficking,"" Burr’s Senate website says. On the other hand, the Ross camp argues, the refusal of Republicans to approve the original bill resulted in a year-long delay in the reauthorization, which kept sexual violence awareness and assistance programs on college campuses from being established, even though reports of sexual assault on college campuses were at an all-time high. So where does this leave us? The Ross camp argues that the ad is accurate since it said that Burr voted against the 2012 version of the bill. They have a point, but making this argument requires ignoring that Burr voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act three times -- in 2000, 2005 and 2013 -- even as he voted against it once, in 2012. The Ross camp also argues that the 2012 vote is important because Burr opposed -- and even voted to strip -- provisions involving LGBT and native Americans. They also have a point here, but their argument would have been stronger had the ad specifically cited Burr’s actions toward LGBT and native Americans. The ad makes no such distinctions; a viewer would be left to assume that he opposed anything to combat violence against women. Finally, we think it’s relevant to note here that, according to Politico, the Democrats specifically teed up this vote to put Republicans in a bind so they could use their votes in campaign ads -- a tactic that both parties have used when they are in a position to do so. Our ruling Ross’ ad said Burr ""voted no on the Violence Against Women Act."" Burr did vote against the 2012 version of the law’s reauthorization, which was important because it effectively meant delaying the revival of an act that had expired. However, the ad ignores that three other times over 13 years Burr voted for a reauthorization of the same law. We rate the statement Half True.","[('Deborah Ross, ""Afraid"" (ad), Oct. 13, 2016', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb5UfJ4Ld_o'), ('Deborah Ross, ad backup, accessed Oct. 17, 2016', 'No link'), ('Richard Burr, legislative accomplishments web page, accessed Oct. 17, 2016', 'https://secure.deborahross.com/page/-/161012RossAfraidBackup.pdf'), ('Congress.gov, ""H.R. 3244 - Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000,"" accessed Oct. 17, 2016', 'No link'), ('Congress.gov, ""H.R. 3402 - Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005,"" accessed Oct. 17, 2016', 'http://www.burr.senate.gov/issues/legislative-accomplishments'), ('Govtrack.us, ""S. 1925 (112th): Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2012,"" accessed Oct. 17, 2016', 'No link'), ('Congress.gov, ""Senate amendment 2095 to Senate amendment 2093,"" accessed Oct. 17, 2016', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/106th-congress/house-bill/3244/actions'), ('Congress.gov, ""S. 47 - Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013,"" accessed Oct. 17, 2016', 'No link'), ('House roll call vote, Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization, Sept. 26, 2000', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/3402/actions'), ('Senate roll call vote, Hutchison amendment No. 2095, April 26, 2012', 'No link'), ('Senate roll call vote, Grassley amendment No. 14, Feb. 7, 2013', 'https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2012/s87'), ('Senate roll call vote, ""S. 47 (Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013),"" Feb. 12, 2013', 'No link'), ('Congressional Research Service, ""Congressional Oversight: An Overview,"" Feb. 22, 2010', 'https://www.congress.gov/amendment/112th-congress/senate-amendment/2095'), ('Politico, ""Schumer schemes to hit GOP,"" March 14, 2012', 'No link'), ('Washington Post, ""Violence Against Women Act reauthorization bill passed by Senate,"" April 26, 2012', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/47'), ('Washington Post, ""Sex offense statistics show U.S. college reports are rising,"" July 1, 2014', 'No link'), ('New York Times, ""The Caucus: G.O.P.

Clinton twists Trump's words on rescuing the auto industry during recession
","Donald Trump didn’t care about rescuing the auto industry during the 2008 recession, Hillary Clinton said at a rally in Michigan. Clinton told her audience at Wayne State University in Detroit that she supported the 2008 government bailout for the American auto industry, which was faltering during the financial crisis. But Trump, she said, doesn’t support American workers, much less those in Michigan’s auto industry. ""Nobody should be surprised, because back in the Great Recession, when millions of jobs across America hung in the balance, Donald Trump said rescuing the auto industry didn’t really matter very much,"" Clinton said at the Oct. 10 rally. ""He said, and I quote again, ‘Let it go.’ Now, I can’t imagine that. I supported President (Barack) Obama’s decision to rescue the auto industry in America."" Actually, Trump's public comments about the auto industry's demise were the opposite of what Clinton said. He called for saving it. In December 2008, when Congress and then-President George W. Bush were debating giving the auto industry a bailout, Trump gave several interviews in which he stressed the importance of saving the Big Three automakers: General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. Trump’s position on an auto bailout was inconsistent leading up to Dec. 19, 2008, when Bush laid out plans to go forward with the bailout. Trump said the government should help the auto companies, but he also regularly suggested the they could save themselves if they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, with some government support. Mid 2009, months into his first year as president, Obama forced Chrysler and General Motors to go through bankruptcy. While he might have clashed with Bush and Obama on exact particulars of how to solve the auto crisis, Trump consistently said the auto industry needed to be saved: Dec. 9, 2008, Fox: Trump told host Greta Van Susteren that ""I think you have to try and save the companies, and I think you can easily save the companies."" He added, referring to ""bankruptcy,"" that auto companies ""don't like the ‘B’ word. I think they probably should use it."" Dec. 10, 2008, CNBC: ""You have to save the car industry in this country,"" Trump said. ""General Motors can be great again, Ford can be great again, and Chrysler could be great."" Dec. 17, 2008, Fox: Cavuto asked Trump if he thought the country could do without one of the Big Three auto makers. Trump responded, ""No. I think you should have the Big Three…. I think the government should stand behind them 100 percent. You cannot lose the auto companies. They are great. They make wonderful products. Maybe they are making too much. Maybe they are not making too much. I just bought a Dodge Ram truck from Arrigo Dodge, who is a member of one of my clubs and a great guy."" Dec. 18, 2008, CNN: Host Wolf Blitzer asked Trump if Bush should bail out the auto industry. Trump replied, ""Well, I hope he does it, but you have to make a much better deal with the unions. … The fact is you have to make the companies competitive. And if you're not going to make a deal with the union, and a great and fair deal and a competitive deal, then they shouldn't do it. But absolutely, they should try and save the companies. You just can't lose Chrysler, you can't lose Ford, and you can't lose General Motors."" Clinton also quoted Trump saying ""let it go,"" referring to the auto industry. Clinton’s phrasing makes it sound like Trump said that quote during the recession. But he actually said it in 2015. And Clinton took the comment out of context. ""You could have let it go, and rebuilt itself, through the free enterprise system,"" Trump said in August 2015, according to the Washington Post. ""You could have let it go bankrupt, frankly, and rebuilt itself, and a lot of people felt it should happen. Or you could have done it the way it went. I could have done it either way. Either way would have been acceptable. I think you would have wound up in the same place."" So six years after the $80 billion bailout began, Trump has maintained his ambiguous position. He said either a bailout or just bankruptcy would have been fine. But his message was not firmly, as Clinton implied, that the country should have left the auto industry out to dry. Our ruling Clinton said, ""Back in the Great Recession, when millions of  jobs across America hung in the balance, Donald Trump said rescuing the auto industry didn’t really matter very much. He said, and I quote again, ‘Let it go.’ "" Trump is documented as saying just the opposite during the recession. He regularly said the auto industry needed saving amid a low point for manufacturers in December 2008. He said the government should stand behind the auto industry ""100 percent.""

"['Transportation', 'Texas', 'Texas Automobile Dealers Association']","
Car dealers tout $500 in average consumer savings, but cited study not so extensive
","To say Tesla Motors hasn’t had an easy ride directly selling its high-end electric vehicles to Texans is an understatement. That’s probably due in part to the sway of the Texas Automobile Dealers Association, which through the 2013 and 2015 state legislative sessions stopped Tesla’s effort to repeal a prohibition on vehicle manufacturers selling directly to Texas motorists -- a standoff expected to renew in the 2017 session. So we noticed when @teslaintexas, a Twitter account for Tesla’s efforts in Texas, said in a  September 2016 tweet: ""Auto dealers profit off the current system."" The tweet urged followers to tell legislators to legalize ""direct sales."" The auto dealers association, through the @autodealerstx account, shot back with a tweet stating ""consumers save avg of $500 per car sold through franchised dealer model. #txlege got it right the first time."" We wondered about that savings figure, ultimately finding the association’s cited study didn’t compare dealership sales to online or phone sales of the kind that Tesla conducts with Texas customers. First, it’s worth a look at what the auto dealers and Tesla have been tussling over. The Texas franchise law, implemented decades ago, prohibited direct sales of vehicles from the manufacturer to the consumer. In other words, Tesla cannot sell cars at their own Texas showrooms, though it may process orders by phone or online. Other states, including Connecticut, Michigan and Utah, have dealership statutes, according to Stateline, a reporting service on state policy funded by the Pew Charitable Trust. For their part, TADA has told lawmakers that the franchise model saves consumers money because it allows them to shop around independently-owned dealerships, where deals and other incentives can drop the car’s sticker price. So why has Tesla declined to sell its electric vehicles through Texas dealerships a la Ford, Chevrolet and Toyota? Appearing before the Federal Trade Commission in January 2016, Todd Maron, Tesla’s general counsel, said the Texas model would not work for the company because, unlike traditional dealerships that often sprawl side by side along major highways, Tesla's showrooms need to be smaller and are already built in high foot traffic shopping areas. Such a setup encourages a necessary education process for buyers who must learn about the company’s relatively new electric technology, Maron said. Large car dealerships cannot offer those resources, Tesla representatives have argued. Legislation that would have allowed Tesla to get around the state’s franchise dealer model won approval from a Texas House committee in 2013 but went no further. In 2015, Tesla-friendly measures got a House committee hearing and no more. Back to the money claim: We asked the dealers association about how it got its $500 savings figure for dealerships versus direct sales to motorists. On behalf of the association, consultant Jennifer Stevens pointed us to a journal article, ""State Automobile Franchise Laws: Public or Private Interests?"" It was published July 12, 2016 on the website of the Washington, D.C.-based Phoenix Center for Advanced Legal & Economic Public Policy Studies, a nonprofit founded in 1998 ""with a mission to provide independent assessments of the economic and material implications of regulatory and economic policy in the U.S. and abroad,"" according to its website. But, we noticed, the study didn’t compare shopping in a dealership to shopping for cars online. Rather, it largely considers a broader debate about state auto franchise laws -- whether dealers protect consumers from manufacturers or whether they’re a scheme to protect dealership owners. We noticed that the touted $500 figure doesn’t show up in the paper. Asked about that, one of the paper’s authors, George Ford, the center’s chief economist, pointed out the figure in the abstract of a March 2015 Phoenix Center policy paper, which minorly cited in first paper, on ""the price effects of intra-brand competition. In other words, this paper focused on competition among retailers that sell the same branded product, measuring competition as ""the distance (in miles) to the nearest same-brand dealer,"" the paper said. The abstract states: ""For the popular Honda Accord, for example, increasing the distance between Honda dealerships by thirty miles raises the price paid by consumers by about $500."" The researchers found that for nearly all the car models they looked at -- limited to the 10 most popular new cars bought in Texas from 2011-2013 -- competition between same-brand dealers lowered the price tag on new cars. The authors considered price as a function of the distance between the nearest same-brand dealers, allowing them to find the average price at various distances. The bottom line, according to the study’s authors, is that more independent dealers competing for consumers’ money meant lower prices for the consumers. Ford, a co-author of both papers, said there was previously a lack of economic analysis on the ""fairly important"" issue of price changes due to dealership competition, so he and a colleague set out to do that. Fiona M. Scott Morton, an economics professor at Yale University, disagreed with the overall analyses of the center’s two studies. The Texas model does not reduce in any discernable way the amount customers will pay for a car, a claim which long has been advanced by the automobile associations to keep the model, Morton said. In fact, according to her analysis of the issue at the state level, the opposite can be true. ""One issue that’s particularly confusing to lay people is the idea that the dealers create price competition with each other"" under a dealership model like Texas’, she said. ""There is no sense that a manufacturer who owns his own store would charge more. Truthfully, there are no issues with the manufacturer having their own stores."" Next, we hunted other relevant research on the specific question about customers saving money at car dealerships as opposed to via a direct sales model. Several professors, including Mortons, pointed us to a U.S. Department of Justice analysis from 2009, conducted by Gerald R. Bodisch that focused on the state bans on direct sales, which Bodisch said may hinder the development of a more cost-effective method for car distribution. In the paper, Bodisch writes that most buyers today likely would want some hands-on contact with the car before purchasing, but if state bans were repealed, the situation for consumers could look different. ""Surveys do show that many new car buyers in America would be interested in buying directly from manufacturers, particularly to avoid costs associated with the dealer/customer bargaining process. In one survey, almost half of respondents said that they would opt to buy cars direct from the manufacturer even if it didn't save any money,"" he wrote. Daniel Crane, a University of Michigan law professor who focuses on regulation and studies franchise models, said the study’s attempt to correlate the dealership model’s intra-brand competition with generally more savings for consumers is bogus. ""I’m not denying that it’s possible that (dealerships) could lead to lower prices, but it’s not because of the law. You don’t need the law for that,"" Crane said. ""The dealer could just turn out to be more efficient than the manufacturer."" The independent experts we talked with said there is no way to compare how much Texas consumers save when purchasing a vehicle at a dealership versus online from Tesla, because Tesla can’t sell directly to consumers from showrooms in the state. Finally, we circled back to the auto dealers association. Its president, Bill Wolters, stood by its tweet and cited study. By phone, Wolters agreed the study didn’t compare traditional dealers to Tesla’s sales methods. However, Wolters said, the conclusion suggesting dollar savings due to franchises being abundant signals a built-in advantage for consumers that Wolters said he doesn’t believe manufacturers like Tesla would offer through showrooms which, Wolters predicted, would solely be concentrated in the state’s biggest cities. Our ruling The auto dealers association responded to a tweet talking up direct sales by car manufacturers by saying consumers save an average of $500 by shopping at traditional roadside dealers. However, studies offered to back up this claim didn’t gauge whether shoppers save money by visiting dealers rather than buying directly from manufacturers. The $500 savings figure ties to shopping roadside dealers offering the same model of car. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Rubio: 'Not even Tim Kaine is willing' to say he trusts Hillary Clinton
","Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said Democrat U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy is in ""rare company"" by fully trusting Hillary Clinton. The U.S. Senate candidates relentlessly attacked the other’s presidential party nominee at the U.S. Senate debate Oct. 17 in Orlando. After Murphy explained to the audience why he supports Clinton, Rubio fired back with an unsubstantiated claim about U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee. ""If Congressman Murphy trusts Hillary Clinton 100 percent, he’s in rare company, because not even Tim Kaine is willing to say that,"" Rubio said, ""and he’s her running mate."" His line got a few laughs, but a quick search of articles and transcripts refutes his point. ‘I trust Hillary Clinton with our son’s life’ Kaine accepted his party’s nomination to be vice president on July 27 during the Democratic National Convention, less than a week after Clinton announced him as her choice. In his speech, the Virginia senator and former Virginia governor vouched for Clinton’s character and urged voters to trust her. ""Hey, last week, last week in Cleveland we heard a lot about trust,"" Kaine said, referring to the Republican National Convention. ""So let’s talk about trust. Let’s talk about trust. I want to tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton."" Kaine pointed to Clinton’s longtime work helping kids and families through her work on the Children’s Defense Fund, and added, ""And on a personal level, as (Nat) is serving our nation abroad, I trust Hillary Clinton with our son’s life."" Kaine reiterated his trust more recently during the first question of the vice presidential debate on Oct. 7 about why he would be qualified to fill the position of president if need be. ""We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life,"" Kaine said. ""We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now. We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander in chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander in chief scares us to death."" With all of this talk about trust, we wondered what Rubio was talking about. His campaign sent PolitiFact Florida a news release exploring Kaine’s comments regarding Clinton’s trustworthiness, pointing to Kaine’s interview ABC’s The View in October. ""During an appearance on The View, Tim Kaine would not say that Hillary Clinton is trustworthy when asked about ‘voters that have doubted her on the trust issues,’ reads the release. Watch the clip for yourself. After we did, we found the press release was misleading — and Rubio’s interpretation was even more over the top.  Kaine doesn’t say he trusts Clinton, but he’s never explicitly asked if he does. He is probed about the internal emails released by Wikileaks, and how findings that Clinton might have received debate questions ahead of time affect the campaign, especially since Clinton has struggled with trust among voters. ""And we've seen that one of the issues that she's struggled with is this issue of trust. Does this support that?"" The View co-host Jedediah Bila asked Kaine. ""Or what do you say to voters that have doubted her on the trust issues and now see these things coming through via Wikileaks?"" Kaine told the audience that the Russian government was behind the Wikileaks, adding that ""you can't automatically assume that everything in all of these documents are even real."" He then went on to defend Clinton’s character, referencing her fight for health insurance for low-income children. ""Hillary Clinton has a passion from the time she was a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago,"" Kaine said. ""Under the influence of this great guy named Don Jones, her passion has been empowering families and kids."" Our ruling Rubio said that ""not even Tim Kaine"" is willing to say that he trusts Hillary Clinton. This is wrong. Kaine has vocalized his trust of Clinton on multiple occasions, and there is no evidence suggesting Kaine doesn’t feel this way. Rubio’s statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

Trump off-base on Buffett, Soros deductions
","Facing scrutiny over possibly not paying federal income tax for almost two decades, Donald Trump turned the tables on Hillary Clinton during the heated second presidential debate. The New York Times obtained a few pages of Trump’s 1995 personal tax returns, revealing a $916 million loss that would have allowed him to legally avoid paying taxes for 18 years. Trump didn’t deny this and instead claimed Clinton backers Warren Buffett and George Soros did the same to a larger extent. ""Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who is a friend of hers, took a massive deduction,"" he said. We wondered if this was accurate. The Trump campaign did not respond to our requests for comment, but we found an instance where Trump gave exact numbers. ""Soros declared $1.5 (billion) losses, $1.5 billion in just six months, and Warren Buffett declared $873 million. Ask them, did they write off those losses? Oh, I doubt it,"" Trump told Fox Business News on Oct. 4, 2016. While both Soros and Buffett had losses, Trump is not exactly making an apples-to-apples comparison. Buffett’s loss was claimed on his business’s tax returns, not his own. Soros’ losses are from his hedge funds, so any deductions would not be on Soros’s private tax returns. Trump, meanwhile, claimed a personal deduction. It’s unclear exactly what loss of Soros’ Trump is referring to. The Soros Fund Management lost $1.3 billion between May and August 2011. Soros’ Quantum Fund lost $2 billion in 1998. But again, deductions caused by these losses wouldn’t appear on Soros’s personal tax returns, according to Lawrence Zelenak, a Duke University law professor. Buffett’s business Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is a publicly traded company, and acts as a holding company for other businesses. In 2013, the company suffered a $873 million loss after a failed investment. The company had profits that year as well, but received a $514 million deduction in 2013, according to its annual report. In other words, the deduction was applied to the company’s taxes, not Buffett’s own taxes. Trump’s companies are his own private ventures, meaning he can claim their losses in his personal income taxes by declaring them ""pass-through"" income. In 1995, Trump lost $916 million, according to a report by the New York Times. The article says Trump’s loss is from three Atlantic City casinos, a failure in the airline business, and a purchase of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. The almost $1 billion loss could have allowed Trump to legally avoid paying taxes for the next 18 years through an IRS provision called a ""carry-forward."" A carry-forward is an income tax rule that allows a taxpayer to save an unused deduction, credit or loss, and use it in the future. Trump’s loss could have allowed him to have a $50 million per year carry-forward over 18 years. However, Eric Toder, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said it’s hard to tell exactly how Trump handled his taxes the following years without the tax returns. ""We don’t know exactly what he did,"" Toder said. ""We know he took a large loss -- unusually large."" So we can’t know just how much Trump deducted without his personal tax returns (which he promised to release but has not). The same goes for Buffett’s and Soros’ personal taxes. Neither of their spokespeople got back to us, but Buffett released a statement detailing his personal taxes. In that statement, Buffett said his income was $11.6 million in 2015, and his deductions equaled $5.5 million. Buffett also said that $3.5 million of this was allowable charitable contributions, and the rest -- except for $36,037 -- was for state income taxes. Soros’s personal income taxes may have benefited from a tax rule that allows hedge fund managers and private equity executives to pay a lower income tax rate. Buffett does not run a hedge fund, and so would not have benefited from that same rule. Buffett’s low tax rate of 16 percent is because he earns the majority of his money from investments. In his statement, Buffett said he paid income tax every year since 1944, and none use a carry-forward. Our ruling Trump said, ""Many of (Hillary Clinton’s) friends took bigger deductions (than me). Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who is a friend of hers, took a massive deduction."" Trump’s $916 million loss could have allowed him to have a $50 million deduction each year for 18 years. As for Buffet and Soros, Trump is likely referring to a $514 million deduction Buffett’s company, not Buffett himself, took in 2013. (We’ll note that this amount is actually smaller than what Trump would have been permitted to take.) Buffett says he personally took a $5.5 million deduction. Soros manages a hedge fund. Experts told us any deductions from this hedge fund would not appear on Soros’ personal tax returns. Without copies of actual tax return forms, it’s impossible to tell for sure what each man did with their taxes, but with the information available, it seems that the situations of Buffett and Soros are not that similar to Trump’s. We rate Trump’s claim Mostly False.","[('Interview with \xa0Eric Toder, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, Oct. 11, 2016', 'http://fortune.com/2016/10/10/warren-buffett-taxes-trump/'), ('Fortune, ""How Warren Buffett\'s Released Tax Returns Prove Trump Wrong"", Oct. 10, 2016', 'No link'), ('NBC News, ""Trump’s Debate Claim About Tax Deductions Dubious, Experts Say,"" Oct. 10, 2016', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-presidential-debates/trump-s-debate-claim-about-tax-deductions-dubious-experts-say-n663791'), ('The New York Times, ""Donald Trump Acknowledges Not Paying Federal Income Taxes for Years,"" Oct. 10, 2016', 'No link'), ('BusinessWire, ""Some Tax Facts for Donald Trump,"" Oct. 10, 2016', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?_r=0'), ('The Balance, ""What Is the Definition of a Tax Carryforward?"", June 6, 2016', 'No link'), ('The New York Times, ""Pages from Donald Trump’s 1995 Income Tax Records,"" Oct. 1, 2016', 'http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161010005859/en/Tax-Facts-Donald-Trump'), ('Berkshire Hathaway, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. 2015 Annual Report, 2015', 'No link'), ('Berkshire Hathaway, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. 2013 Annual Report, 2013', 'https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-definition-of-a-tax-carryforward-795178'), ('Fortune, Buffett lost nearly $900 million exiting biggest buyout ever, March 1, 2014', 'No link'), ('Fox Business, Trump Bashes Soros, Buffett on Business Records, Oct. 4, 2016', 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/01/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html'), ('United States Securities and Exchange Commission, FORM 13F Soros Fund Management, May 16, 2011', 'No link'), ('United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Form 13F Soros Fund Management, Aug. 15, 2011', 'http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2015ar/2015ar.pdf')]",/factchecks/2016/oct/18/donald-trump/trump-base-buffett-soros-deductions/

Clinton correct Buffett claimed to pay a lower tax rate than his secretary
","During the second presidential debate, Hillary Clinton argued against tax rules that allow the ultra-rich to pay lower rates than the middle class. She said she would change them as president, a move that has become known as the ""Buffett rule."" ""Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary,"" Clinton said. Warren Buffett is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Forbes estimates him to be worth $64.3 billion and one of the richest men in the world. He is also a Hillary Clinton supporter and has sparred with Donald Trump over Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns. Urging major tax changes, Buffett has repeatedly said he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary and other employees. In 2007, Buffett told NBC Nightly News that he pays a smaller tax rate than multiple employees in his office. In 2011, Buffett wrote an op-ed in the New York Times called ""Stop Coddling the Super-Rich."" In the article, Buffett said that his taxes amounted to ""only 17.4 percent of my taxable income — and that’s actually a lower percentage than was paid by any of the other 20 people in our office."" In 2013, he told CNBC that while his tax rate rose 8 to 9 points more that year, ""The differential between me and the rest of the office, not just my secretary but the rest of the office, was greater than that. It'll be closer, but I'll probably be the lowest-paying taxpayer in the office."" A quick phone call to Buffett’s office confirmed this fact-check. Buffett’s assistant Debbie Bosanek -- the secretary Buffett mentions -- confirmed her boss pays a lower tax rate than she does. So, how can this be? Buffett’s op-ed says his tax rate is lower than his employees’ because money made off investments is taxed at a lower rate than wage income ""If you make money with money, as some of my super-rich friends do, your percentage may be a bit lower than mine. But if you earn money from a job, your percentage will surely exceed mine — most likely by a lot,"" Buffett said. Personal income is taxed based on how much a person makes each year. In 2016, the brackets range from 10 percent for those making $9,275 or less, to a top marginal rate of 39.6 percent for those making $415,051 or more. Meanwhile, the tax rate on long-term capital gains -- the profits from investments -- is 15 percent. However, if the taxpayer's taxable income is greater than $415,051, their long term capital gains are taxed at 20 percent. Here are the current rates for a single taxpayer. Taxable Income Tax Rate $0 to $9,275 10% $9,276 to $37,650 $927.50 plus 15% of the amount over $9,275 $37,651 to $91,150 $5,183.75 plus 25% of the amount over $37,650 $91,151 to $190,150 $18,558.75 plus 28% of the amount over $91,150 $190,151 to $413,350 $46,278.75 plus 33% of the amount over $190,150 $413,351 to $415,050 $119,934.75 plus 35% of the amount over $413,350 $415,051 or more $120,529.75 plus 39.6% of the amount over $415,050 On Oct. 10, 2016, Buffett released details about his personal tax data in a statement titled, ""Some Tax Facts for Donald Trump."" He says he paid $1.85 million in federal taxes in 2015, and his adjusted gross income was $11.6 million. That means he paid 15.9 percent in effective federal income tax. Lawrence Zelenak, a Duke University law professor, said in an email most taxpayers with incomes in the low six figures have a higher rate than 16 percent. ""That's true even if you consider only federal income tax. Add in payroll tax and Buffet's rate becomes even lower compared with his secretary,"" he said. Payroll taxes are separate from income taxes, and are deducted by your employer before you get your paycheck. These taxes pay for Medicare and Social Security. The employee tax rate for Social Security is typically 6.2 percent of your gross income, up to $113,700, and 1.45 percent on all income for Medicare. These two rates are not progressive or applied to all income, so as income increases, they make up a smaller percentage of the total income. Since Buffett makes the majority of his money from investments, his wage income -- and therefore his payroll taxes -- are low. But those who work for a living, especially those who make higher than average salaries, get taxed at higher rates. We don’t know what salary Buffett’s secretary earns, but it’s likely much higher than the median pay for secretaries. (Remember that Buffett is one of the richest men in the world.) A study from the nonpartisan The Tax Policy Center says that people making between $100,000 and $200,000 pay an average 19.6 percent in taxes, including payroll and income taxes.

Marco Rubio misleads about Floridians who will 'lose' insurance through Obamacare
","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., continued his attacks on Obamacare during the first U.S. Senate debate against his Democratic rival, U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy. Rubio said that Obamacare has ""enormous problems."" ""No. 1, it is running up our debt. No. 2, people are losing their coverage. In about three weeks over a half million Floridians are going to lose their coverage again,"" he said. ""It is collapsing under its own weight because it doesn’t work."" We will fact-check if that many Floridians are poised to lose their health care plans. Obamacare plans Bloomberg News reported Oct. 14 that nationwide, more than 1 million people will lose plans -- and the largest number of losses will be in Florida with more than 400,000. Bloomberg interviewed state regulators and learned a few health insurance companies are quitting the marketplace where people can shop for policies. Sign up for coverage begins in November. In August, Aetna announced that it would stop selling Obamacare plans in 11 states, including Florida for 2017, due to significant financial losses. UnitedHealth is exiting the individual market, and Humana will withdraw from most of the counties it serves in the individual market. As of May 9,  approximately 420,000 enrollees in Florida are expected to lose their plans due to withdrawals in the individual exchange marketplace with additional enrollees losing coverage off-exchange, according to Karen Kees, a spokeswoman for the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. Floridians who lose their plan can sign up for another one. Fifteen insurance companies have filed requests to sell individual coverage plans in Florida, including 11 insurers that requested to sell plans on the exchange. ""It’s not 400,000 are going to be uninsured. (It’s) 400,000 are going to have to switch insurers,"" said Timothy Jost, author of the Health Affairs Blog and emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law. And many people each year change plans any way when they seek out a better deal, he said. The premium could be similar for most shoppers since the amount is based on tax credits that are set based on a consumer’s income, Jost said. While the state said that premiums will increase on average 19 percent, Jost said that is before the tax credits that apply to many buying on the marketplace. Jost said the irony in the disruption is that Rubio pushed to defund the risk corridor program that was intended to stabilize the market so that plans that made big profits would pay in and those with big losses would collect. In the end, those funds were limited.  ""Rubio has to take a lot of credit for Floridians losing coverage,"" Jost said. ""Had the program operated the way it was intended to operate, a lot more insurers would still be in the marketplace."" Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said while these Floridians will still be insured a new plan could mean changes for them. ""Yes, they will get something of similar price and quality, but it won’t necessarily be in the same network, it may not cover their current doctor,"" he said. However, it is deceptive to say Floridians will ""lose"" coverage without explaining that they will get a new plan, said David Himmelstein, professor in the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College. ""Many Floridians will have to change insurers,"" he said. ""Some will likely have worse, or more expensive coverage -- although we don't know how many at present. Is that losing coverage? I don't think most people would characterize it that way."" Nationwide, most consumers will have multiple choices but fewer than in the past, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation found. Rubio made a similar misleading statement before about people losing health care. In 2013, Rubio said that ""300,000 people are going to lose their individual coverage because of Obamacare. Now those people next year, they don’t have health insurance."" Since Florida Blue provided assistance with switching plans, we rated Rubio’s statement Mostly False because he jumped the gun by saying flatly that they wouldn’t have insurance. Ultimately, more than 80 percent of the approximately 300,000 members remained with Florida Blue. This time, Florida Blue is expected to pick up many of those who will lose coverage with another carrier. Florida Blue currently has about 700,000 people covered through the marketplace, which is more than any other carrier, spokesman Doug Bartel said. It will continue to offer plans in every Florida county. ""We fully expect based upon our products, price, network and benefits that we will pick up many of the consumers whose insurance company is leaving the marketplace,"" he said. Rubio’s debate statement also ignores that due to the Affordable Care Act, more Floridians have coverage. More than 1.7 million Floridians purchased plans through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces between Nov. 1, 2015, and Feb. 1, 2016. So that’s more than the 400,000 who will ""lose"" their plan -- and they aren’t actually going to lose insurance. Federal data shows that the percentage of insured in Florida has been steadily dropping. In 2013, 20 percent of Floridians lacked health coverage. In 2014, that number fell to 16.6 percent, and in 2015, it fell again to 13.3 percent. The majority of Americans still get their insurance through their employer -- not the individual marketplace. Our ruling Rubio said in the Senate debate ""in about three weeks over a half million Floridians are going to lose their coverage again"" through Obamacare. That’s a reference to more than 400,000 Floridians who are expected to lose their plans under the Obamacare exchange. However, Rubio omits that they will be offered another plan including by Florida Blue, which will remain in every county in Florida. Rubio also ignores the fact that due to the marketplace, 1.7 million Floridians have signed up for coverage -- larger than the more than 400,000 who will have to switch plans. The percentage of Floridians who are uninsured has been dropping under Obamacare in recent years. We rate this claim Half True.","[('Bloomberg, ""More Than 1 Million to Lose Obamacare Plans as Insurers Quit,"" Oct. 14, 2016', 'https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-14/more-than-1-million-in-obamacare-to-lose-plans-as-insurers-quit'), ('C-SPAN, U.S. Senate debate, Oct. 17, 2016', 'No link'), ('U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Issue brief, April 2016', 'https://www.c-span.org/video/?415827-1/florida-senate-debate&start=216'), ('Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, Individual PPACA Market Monthly Premiums for Plan Year 2017', 'No link'), ('Health Affairs Blog by Timothy Jost, ""ACA Round-Up: Discontinued Plans, Quality And Network Breadth Info, And More,"" Oct. 3, 2016', 'https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/198636/MarketplaceRate.pdf'), ('Health Affairs Blog by Timothy Jost, ""Implementing Health Reform: New Guidance On Reenrollment Of 2015 Enrollees (Updated),"" Aug. 26, 2015', 'No link'), ('Henry J.

"['Illinois', 'Guns', 'Brad Schneider']","
Schneider claim about Dold gun stand omits key facts
","As the race for Illinois’ 10th District seat enters its home stretch, the debate over gun control remains one of the central issues between Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Dold and Democratic challenger Brad Schneider. On Sept. 16, Schneider tweeted a request for supporters to sign a petition asking Dold to stop blocking a vote on gun safety legislation. On Sept. 27, Schneider's campaign announced that the petition had gained more than 600 signatures. In the text of the petition, Schneider's campaign wrote: ""Republican Bob Dold refuses to sign a Congressional petition that would force Speaker Ryan to allow a vote on commonsense gun safety legislation. Instead, Dold continues to side with his Republican leadership and the NRA in blocking consideration of a bill that would keep firearms out of the hands of people on the terrorist watch list."" Let’s unpack that a little bit. ‘No fly, no buy’ At the heart of this claim is the debate surrounding the so-called ""No Fly, No Buy"" bill, officially known as H.R. 1076. As its title suggests, the bill aims to ban the sale of firearms to people who are on the FBI terrorist watchlist. First introduced in February 2015, the bill has been stalled in Congress since December 2015. Democrats have been using various procedural methods to try to move the bill forward. Schneider said Dold has refused to sign a congressional petition that would force a vote on H.R. 1076 and ""continues to side with… the NRA"" in obstructing the bill. We found that claim curious because Dold is one of the co-sponsors of H.R. 1076 and he has received an ""F"" rating from the National Rifle Association for his voting record on gun rights. The petition to force a vote on it currently has 181 signatures, which is 37 short of the required 218. It is true that Dold did not sign the petition. Democrats also have used ""orders for the previous question"" and motions to recommit to try and bring the bill to the floor. Put simply, an ""order for the previous question"" is a vote on whether or not to change the agenda and consider alternate legislation. A ""motion to recommit with instructions forthwith"" allows a member of the minority to add an amendment to a piece of legislation just before a vote. Schneider’s campaign offers a list of 25 instances when the Democrats presented either an order for a previous question or a motion to recommit to bring H.R. 1076 to the floor. (Since they first sent us the list, there have been an additional three orders for a previous question). The campaign points out that in each of these instances, Dold sided with the ""Republican leadership and the NRA"" in order to block consideration of H.R. 1076. We looked at each of the 25 instances cited by Schneider’s campaign, and indeed Dold’s voting record was not in favor of bringing H.R. 1076 to the floor for consideration. However, that is not the full story. Dold’s gun control record Dold, who is facing Schneider for the third consecutive time, said Schneider was distorting his record. ""While we have all grown accustomed to the shameless lies from Brad Schneider and his campaign, Brad's incredibly dishonest attacks against my record of championing common-sense gun legislation are sadly another example of the worst kind of politics that the 10th District and the American people are completely tired of."" Dold is referring to his record in co-sponsoring the Zero Tolerance for Domestic Abusers Act, as well as his co-sponsorship of the aforementioned H.R. 1076. He has also spoken on the House floor in favor of reducing gun violence following the Orlando shooting this past summer. Since part of the claim said Dold was siding with the National Rifle Association, we also looked at the gun lobby’s report card and found Dold received an ""F,"" a grade the NRA uses to label those they consider a ""true enemy of gun owner’s rights."" Schneider also has got an ""F"" rating. However, Schneider spokesman Steven Kirsch, while acknowledging Dold’s co-sponsorship of H.R. 1076, said, ""Democrats are using every tool available to try to force a vote on gun safety legislation. But instead of taking action in favor of the legislation he claims to support, Congressman Bob Dold sides time and time again with his Republican Party to prevent even having a vote. … Until Dold shows he is willing to take action alongside those fighting to a get a vote on this critical legislation instead of continuing to side with his party, his words of support remain just that – words."" Some additional caveats Neither orders for previous questions nor motions to recommit are as clear cut as they first seem. Both Republicans and Democrats, when they are in the minority, claim that previous questions have ""substantive policy implications."" At the same time, both call out the opposing majority party for claiming that previous questions are purely procedural votes. So which is it? We asked Josh Chafetz, a professor of law at Cornell Law School. He confirmed that this can be tricky: ""You can't separate procedure and substance, so the votes usually are good proxies for someone's substantive stance, BUT it can be very, very difficult to untangle exactly what the substantive consequences of a particular vote are. ... Basically, without getting deep into the weeds of a particular series of votes, you can't really say definitively what the substantive implications of a vote were."" Similar statements have been made about motions to recommit. In a 2012 interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin, Donald Wolfensberger, who currently is a fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center and served as a key Republican staffer in the 1990s, said ""both parties, when in the minority, have used (motions to recommit) to make political statements and embarrass the majority for partisan advantage. It is well understood in modern times that these are designed for partisan campaign purposes and usually have little to do with better policy."" Our ruling Dold has not signed the discharge petition for the ""No Fly, No Buy"" bill, and his voting record (as demonstrated through previous questions and motions to recommit) has not helped to progress a vote on the bill. However, there are additional details worth considering that the claim does not mention. Dold is a co-sponsor of the ""No Fly, No Buy"" bill itself, and his past record has caused the NRA to label him a ""true enemy of gun owner’s rights."" There also is some ambiguity on the intention behind procedural maneuvers. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information.

Marco Rubio called equal pay for women 'a waste of time,' Patrick Murphy says
","During their first debate, U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy attacked incumbent U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio’s positions on women’s issues, saying Rubio didn’t think the battle for equal pay was worth fighting. ""When asked about equal pay for women, your quote was that it was a waste of time,"" Murphy said Oct. 17 at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. We checked the record to see if Rubio called the issue a ""waste of time."" While he used the expression, it was because he opposed specific parts of equal pay legislation, not the overall concept. The Paycheck Fairness Act Murphy’s accusation centers on Rubio’s take on the 2014 version of the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill filed in the U.S. Senate by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md. Democrats had touted the measure as a way to increase gender parity in compensation, but Republicans opposed tthe bill. Rubio was one of the Republicans who planned to vote against it. In April 2014, after the bill was introduced, Rubio told CNN’s Jake Tapper that he felt it was addressing equal pay in the wrong manner. Rubio said that he was against provisions to make it easier to sue for discrimination, and that it would be better to focus on training to help women gain job skills (emphasis ours): ""The proposals before the Senate now are really geared toward making it easier to sue an employer,"" Rubio told Tapper on April 8, 2014. ""I understand the political benefit of highlighting that and why they're (Democrats) doing it, but it isn't going to solve the core of the problem. And I just think we're wasting time. Meanwhile, an entire generation of young women is caught in low-paying jobs with no way to emerge from that into a better-paying job."" Tapper pointed out that female staffers in Rubio’s office made less than the men. Rubio admitted there was ""a disproportionate number of women in our office who are working at the legislative assistant level,"" which accounted for the gap. ""In terms of apples to apples, where you have two people working the same job, we pay people based on their skill and their ability and not their race, their gender, or anything of that matter,"" Rubio said. The next day, the Paycheck Fairness Act lost a cloture vote, when Rubio and other Republicans voted against it, and the bill failed to advance. He voted against the measure two more times that year before it was reintroduced in the following Congress. Rubio had made similar comments in 2012 about an earlier version of the bill, which he had voted against. ""Once again, Senate Democrats have wasted the American people’s time by holding yet another show vote that proves any sense of urgency they have is about scoring political points instead of solving the problems that threaten America’s future,"" he said in a statement. He also attacked the 2012 version for including measures that he said would lead to lawsuits. He said the bill read to him like ""a welfare plan for trial lawyers."" Rubio touted another bill called the RAISE Act, but that bill focused on merit-based pay raises in union shops, not specifically gender equity. The context here is important, because it’s not that Rubio said he thought the concept of addressing the pay gap was a waste of time. He said he disagreed with Democrats trying to advance what he considered ineffective legislation. During the debate, Rubio said he supported equal pay for women, especially because he has two young daughters who will be entering the workforce. But he chastised Murphy’s talking point, alleging that under the Paycheck Fairness Act, a business trying to keep a woman from being lured away by another company wouldn’t be able to give her a raise to keep her without also giving her male counterpart a raise. ""It has unintended consequences that would not have achieved parity in pay, but would have had these consequences making it very difficult for businesses to actually give raises to men and to women,"" Rubio said. It’s not our job to debate the merits of one policy approach over another. It’s clear Murphy wants to make it appear as if Rubio said the very issue is a waste of time, when Rubio actually was deriding a specific Democratic approach. Our ruling Murphy said, ""When asked about equal pay for women, (Rubio’s) quote was that it was a waste of time."" Rubio did use the expression to describe Democratic efforts to advance the Paycheck Fairness Act. Rubio thought the bill focused too much on allowing workers to sue employers for discrimination, and not enough time focusing on job training and other solutions. That’s not the same as dismissing efforts to close the gender pay gap out of hand. Murphy misrepresented the context of Rubio’s response.

During a West Palm Beach, Fla., rally Oct. 13, Trump mentioned FBI Director James Comey, who decided that Clinton's actions did not rise to the level of prosecution. Trump said that Comey ""let her off the hook while other lives, including General Petraeus and many others, have been destroyed for doing far, far less. This is a conspiracy against you the American people and we cannot let this happen or continue."" Trump has made similar comments before, which we’ve looked at in another report. But this time there is more information publicly available about the information practices of both Petreaus and Clinton. ​So we decided to compare the two cases for the Truth-O-Meter. We're relying on Comey's statements because they were made under oath before two congressional committees, and he is one of the few people familiar with the circumstances and the secrets involved in both cases who is able to speak on the record. Comey’s initial testimony Petraeus pled guilty in 2015 to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling confidential materials. He was fined $100,000 and given two years probation. He had given his mistress, Paula Broadwell, access to eight notebooks with top-secret and code information. She had made copies of over 300 documents marked ""secret."" In addition, Petraeus lied to FBI agents investigating the case. In Clinton's case, the FBI found 110 emails with classified information on her server, eight of which were designated top secret. Comey, in a July 5 news conference, said there was no evidence of Clinton or her staff intending to violate the law. But he also said Clinton should have known that her handling of the emails was inappropriate, and that her behavior was ""extremely reckless"" because outsiders could hack her server. The FBI director was asked about the Clinton-Petraeus comparison during his July 7 appearance before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. ""Do you agree with the claim that General Petraeus, and I quote, 'Got in trouble for far less,' end of quote? Do you agree with that statement?"" asked Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-MD. ""No, it's the reverse,"" the FBI director said. Comey cited the Petraeus case as one that ""illustrates perfectly the kind of cases the Department of Justice is willing to prosecute. Even there, they prosecuted him for a misdemeanor. ""In that case, you had vast quantities of highly classified information, including special sensitive compartmented information. That's the reference to code words. (A) vast quantity of it, not only shared with someone without authority to have it, but we found it in a search warrant hidden under the insulation in his attic, and then he lied to us about it during the investigation,"" Comey said. (Later in the hearing, Comey said his staff had corrected him and the notebooks were found in Petraeus' desk, not his attic.) ""So you have obstruction of justice, you have intentional misconduct and a vast quantity of information,"" Comey said. ""He admitted he knew that was the wrong thing to do. That is a perfect illustration of the kind of cases that get prosecuted. In my mind, it illustrates importantly the distinction to this (Clinton) case."" ""And General Petraeus did not admit to these facts when the FBI investigators first interviewed him, did he?"" Cummings asked. ""No,"" Comey said, ""he lied about it."" Comey's subsequent testimony Eighty three days later, Comey was called before the House Judiciary Committee where Republicans tried to get him to change his mind about prosecuting Clinton, and Blake Farenthold, R-Tex., brought up the matter again. Farenthold: ""How do you respond to people who are saying that this is not how (the) average American would be treated. This is only how Hillary Clinton would be treated?"" Comey: ""When people tell you that others have been treated differently, demand from a trustworthy source the details of those cases because — I'm a very aggressive investigator, I was a very aggressive prosecutor — I have gone back through 40 years of cases, and I'm telling you under oath that to prosecute on these facts would be a double standard, because Jane and Joe Smith would not be prosecuted on these facts."" Comey said that, at the FBI, if an agent uses an unclassified email system to do business and, while on that system, talks about classified topics ""you will be in big trouble with the FBI. I'm highly confident of that. I'm also confident, in fact certain, you would not be prosecuted. That's what folks tend to lump together. So I care deeply about what people think about the justice system and that it not have two standards. It does not, and this demonstrates it."" Steven Aftergood, senior research analyst at the Federation of American Scientists and an expert on national security secrecy, said, ""FBI Director Comey's conclusions have unique weight because he was in a position to investigate and assess both cases in depth. The rest of us (including Trump) have to rely on what has been publicly reported or speculated upon. To me, Comey's conclusion is the end of the matter."" Finally, it's worth noting that during the Oct. 4, 2016, vice presidential debate, a variant of the theme came up as Republican Mike Pence said, ""If your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did . . . they'd be court-martialed."" Democrat Tim Kaine said, ""That is absolutely false, and you know that."" The Washington Post Fact Checker, after noting that Clinton's Cabinet-level position made this an apples-to-oranges comparison, consulted about a dozen retired military lawyers and found there was no absolute answer at all. ""What we found was that it’s absolutely unclear, and is subject to prosecutorial discretion and the circumstances of each case,"" the Post reported. ""Technically, yes, a service member can be court-martialed for behavior like Clinton’s, but it’s more likely the person would face administrative action. And the administrative action would depend on each service member’s disciplinary history, the evidence available and prosecutorial discretion."" We contacted several people at the Trump campaign noting Comey's testimony and asked for Trump's evidence. We didn't hear back. Our ruling Trump said Clinton was ""let off the hook"" for her email scandal ""while other lives, including General Petraeus and many others, have been destroyed for doing far, far less."" The director of the FBI director, the man who has intimate knowledge of both cases, has repeatedly insisted under oath that the reverse is true. Petraeus’ case was worse because he intentionally passed a large amount of classified information to an unauthorized person and then lied about it to the FBI. We rate Trump's statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e7a8b46e-fe2d-4fa1-b976-cedce2031a88","[('YouTube, ""Donald Trump, Town Hall 2-17-16 With Morning Joe and Mika Pt 2,"" March 23, 2016; ""Full Event: Donald Trump Rally in Waukesha, Wisconsin (9/28/2016) Trump DESTROYS Hillary Clinton,"" Sept. 29, 2016; and ""Full Event: Donald Trump Rally in West Palm Beach, Florida (10/13/2016) Donald Trump Florida Speech,"" Oct. 13, 2016', 'https://youtu.be/bOpFOuwuBYw?t=4m36s'), ('Congressional Quarterly (subscription required), ""Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Conducts a Townhall Meeting on MSNBC,"" Feb. 17, 2016; ""House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Holds Hearing on FBI Recommendations on Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\'s Email Server, Panel 1,"" July 7, 2016; and ""House Judiciary Committee Holds Hearing on FBI Oversight,"" and ""Republican Presidential Nominee Donald Trump Delivers Remarks at a Campaign Event in Waukesha, Wis.,"" both Sept. 28, 2016', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Was there a double standard on the investigations of David Petraeus and Hillary Clinton?""

Patrick Murphy right about Rubio not trusting Donald Trump with nuclear codes
","Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy questioned how Republican Sen. Marco Rubio could stand by Donald Trump at the first U.S. Senate debate, especially since Rubio attacked Trump throughout the Republican presidential primary. ""My opponent, Marco Rubio, made it clear: Not only does he think Donald Trump is a con man, he went on to say he doesn't trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes,"" Murphy said in Orlando on Oct. 17. Murphy is right — Rubio has not held back in his words against Trump. On multiple occasions, Rubio referred to Trump as a con man or con artist and said he doesn’t trust Trump with the nuclear codes. Rubio did not deny the comments in his response, saying, ""I don’t trust either one of them. And the job of a U.S. senator is not to blindly trust a president because they happen to be from your own party."" He added later: ""I stand by everything I ever said in the Republican primary. And I would admit right off the bat this is not the most inspirational choice we’ve ever had in American history in terms of these two candidates."" The problem, Rubio said, is Democrat Hillary Clinton is even less trustworthy with sensitive information than Trump. So the candidates agree that Rubio trashed Trump but backs the nominee anyway. We ran down the quotes in question. Rubio dubbed Trump a con on multiple occasions when he was vying for the Republican nomination. Most of the name-calling happened after a Feb. 25 GOP primary debate, as Rubio made the morning TV news rounds and attended rallies. Rubio called Trump a con man four times in 15 seconds at a rally in Oklahoma City on Feb. 26. ""I will never stop until we keep a con man from taking over the party of Reagan and the conservative movement,"" Rubio said of Trump. ""He’s a con man. He's a con man. He’s a con man. I'll tell you why."" Rubio, who was critical of Trump’s business background, accused Trump of ""taking advantage"" of voters’ economic anxiety. Then there were Rubio’s appearances on ABC's Good Morning America, NBC’s Today show and CBS’ This Morning, all on Feb. 26. ""A con artist is about to take over the Republican Party and the conservative movement, and we have to put a stop to it,"" Rubio said on CBS. In that same interview, Rubio said he doesn’t trust giving an ""erratic individual"" like Trump the nuclear codes. ""This is the most important government job on the planet, and we're about to turn over the conservative movement to a person that has no ideas of any substance on the important issues — the nuclear codes of the United States — to an erratic individual — and the conservative movement — to someone who has spent a career sticking it to working people,"" Rubio said. Our ruling Murphy said Rubio ""made it clear, not only does he think Donald Trump is a con man, he went on to say he doesn't trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes."" Transcripts and Rubio himself confirm this claim. Rubio even told Monday’s debate crowd he still doesn’t trust Trump with the nuclear codes — he just distrusts Clinton more. We rate Murphy’s claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6d61d798-0c97-4f59-b5c8-71091f7d51c6","[('Email exchange, Patrick Murphy campaign, Oct. 17, 2016', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw_LNuYUqc4'), ('Youtube, ""Marco Rubio Calls Trump a ""Con Man"" 4 Times in 15 Seconds""', 'No link'), ('ABC News, ""Marco Rubio Defends His More Combative Debate Style Against \'Con Artist’,"" Feb. 26, 2016', 'https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/marco-rubio-defends-combative-debate-style-con-artist/story?id=37216857'), ('Today, ""Marco Rubio: Donald Trump Is A ‘Con Artist,’ ‘We Must Put An End To This Lunacy’ | TODAY,"" Feb. 26, 2016', 'No link'), ('CBS This Morning, ""Marco Rubio hits ""con artist"" Donald Trump,"" Feb. 26, 2016', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV1TrW3xqHo')]",/factchecks/2016/oct/18/patrick-murphy/patrick-murphy-right-about-marco-rubio-attacks-don/
