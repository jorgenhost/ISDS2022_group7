Fact-checking Martin Shkreli's claim that Daraprim is 'underpriced, relative to its peers'
","The CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, the company that jacked up the cost of a life-saving drug from $13.50 to $750 essentially overnight, says the new price tag is still below market value. Martin Shkreli, a 32-year-old former hedge fund manager, was singled out as the man behind Turing’s controversial decision. So Shkreli took to the airwaves to defend himself, insisting that the price hike was altruistic or, at the very least, not unique. ""You only need less than 100 pills so at the end of the day, the price for treatment – to save your life – was only $1,000,"" Shkreli told Bloomberg TV on Sept. 21, 2015. ""These days, in modern pharmaceuticals, cancer drugs can cost $100,000 or more, rare disease drugs can cost half a million dollars. Daraprim is still underpriced, relative to its peers."" Daraprim is used to treat a parasitic infection known as toxoplasmosis, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers a leading cause of death attributed to food-borne illnesses.  The Toxoplasma parasite can be transmitted through contaminated food,  water, and kitchen utensils as well as contact with infected cat feces. While 60 million Americans carry the parasite with no symptoms, it can become deadly for those with weakened immune systems. We were curious about Shkreli’s claim that Daraprim’s new price was comparable to ""its peers."" (Shkreli has since said that he would lower the price amid the outrage, but he did not reveal the new price.) Neither Shkreli nor Turing Pharmaceuticals got back to us for this fact-check, but we found that while other treatments are certainly expensive, Shkreli is committing a false equivalence when he compares them to Daraprim. Shkreli is right that other treatments can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars: for example, the cancer drug Revlimid can cost $150,000 per year while Kalydeco, a drug for cystic fibrosis, can cost $300,000 a year, according to the New York Times. By Shkreli’s calculations, the new price of treatment –100 pills of Daraprim for $750 a pop – is $75,000. But that’s a low estimate, according to the Infectious Disease Societies of America. It estimated a new annual cost of $336,000 to $634,000, depending on dosage. Beyond cancer and rare disease treatments, few drugs cost more than $100,000, said David Howard, a professor of health policy and management at Emory University. So the high price Shkreli cited ""isn’t a good benchmark for deciding whether a drug is underpriced,"" he said. Numbers aside, experts told us the real problem with Shkreli’s claim is Daraprim and cancer drugs shouldn’t be compared to each other. ""They're not peers,"" said Amir Attaran, a professor of health law and policy at the University of Ottawa. ""He could have said, ‘A bar of gold cost $1 million, so Daraprim is underpriced.’ He's comparing fish and fowl."" Simply put, cancer and rare disease drugs are almost always under patent, while Daraprim’s expired in 1953. And unlike Daraprim, those drugs are the products of expensive, recent research. ""The comparison is irrelevant. Cancer drugs were developed by companies that invested hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars in research and development,"" said John Lamattina, a former senior vice president at pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who currently writes about the industry for Forbes. Daraprim, meanwhile, ""is generic drug. There’s no research and development they had to do,"" said Gerard Anderson, a professor of health economics and finance at Johns Hopkins University. The research and development for Daraprim happened long before Shkreli bought the rights. It’s the trade name for pyrimethamine, a drug created by Nobel Prize-winning scientist Gertrude Elion that can be used to treat malaria as well as toxoplasmosis. Though no generic drug company has taken up manufacturing Daraprim (there are only about 2,000 U.S. patients who use the drug every year), it’s been available for reproduction for more than 60 years. That means its peers should be other generic drugs like ibuprofen, penicillin, and antibiotics, experts told us. The proposed 5,000 percent price increase on Daraprim is indicative of a larger trend among more niche generic drugs. A joint House and Senate investigation, partly led by Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, found that the annual cost hikes for 10 generic drugs ranged from 390 to 8,200 percent. This ""anarchy pricing"" can be attributed to the failure of the free market and a lack of government regulation, says Alan Sager, a professor of health policy and management at Boston University. ""Essentially, this is an example of where the drug pricing system for generic drugs has totally failed,"" Anderson said. ""In the past, generic drugs have prices that are low because of competition. Anyone can make it with FDA approval. The only thing you can compete on is price. (Shkreli’s) found something where there's no competitors."" Anyone can legally make Daraprim, but for the time being, Turing’s monopoly gives it free reign to impose very high prices. As for Shkreli’s claims that the profits will go to research for a better version of Daraprim, experts aren’t buying it. ""Turing has not got a single clinical trial underway. Shkreli’s not testing new drugs of any kind for toxoplasmosis. He's got nothing registered,"" Attaran said. ""No one needs a new drug for toxoplasmosis anyways. It works so well bloody well."" Our ruling Shkreli, the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, said, ""Daraprim is still underpriced, relative to its peers."" By his own estimates, Daraprim is cheaper than cancer and rare disease drugs, which he considers Daraprim’s ""peers."" By others, Daraprim costs about the same, if not more. Yet experts told us cancer and rare disease drugs are not Daraprim’s peers. Daraprim’s patent expired more than six decades ago and is a niche generic drug. The same cannot be said of cancer treatments. We rate his claim False. Correction: An earlier version of this fact-check misspelled Martin Shkreli's name.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974E4140>],/factchecks/2015/sep/24/martin-shkreli/fact-checking-martin-shkrelis-claim-daraprim-under/

Did Hillary Clinton start the Obama birther movement?
","Call it ricochet politics. First, a questioner at a New Hampshire rally for Donald Trump repeats the lie that President Barack Obama is a Muslim. Trump fails to correct him and faces a round of questions as to why he didn’t. Then the host of NBC’s Meet the Press asks Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson if it would be okay to have a Muslim president and Carson said, ""I absolutely would not agree with that."" This prompts Hillary Clinton to tweet, ""Can a Muslim be President of the United States of America? In a word: Yes. Now let's move on."" Then Trump responds with a tweet of his own. ""Just remember, the birther movement was started by Hillary Clinton in 2008. She was all in!"" The birther movement refers to the long-running myth that Obama was not born in the United States and thus, under the Constitution, could not be president. Trump promoted this belief avidly for several years with anyone who would listen. This week, Trump told Late Show host Stephen Colbert that he doesn’t ""talk about it anymore."" Did Clinton not just start the birther movement but back it wholeheartedly by being ""all in""? The paper trail The allegation about Obama’s birthplace tracks back to the bruising 2008 Democratic primary between Obama and Clinton.  According to a Telegraph article, as early as April 2008, a Clinton supporter passed around an email that questioned where Obama was born. ""Barack Obama’s mother was living in Kenya with his Arab-African father late in her pregnancy,"" it said. ""She was not allowed to travel by plane then, so Barack Obama was born there and his mother then took him to Hawaii to register his birth."" The cry that Obama was not a legitimate candidate grew much louder in June 2008. On June 7, 2008, Clinton conceded and called for all Democrats to rally behind Obama. Some in her party did not care to listen. By June 10, 2008, opponents to Obama were posting on a website called Pumaparty.com. PUMA stood for Party Unity My Ass. The website encouraged frustrated Clinton supporters to back the Republican nominee.  John Avlon, editor-in-chief of the Daily Beast, explored the roots of the birther movement in his book  Wingnuts: How the Lunatic Fringe Is Hijacking America. Avlon described a posting on the PUMA website with the heading ""Obama May Be Illegal to Be Elected President!"" He wrote that a Clinton volunteer in Texas, Linda Starr, played a key role in spreading the rumor. Starr connected with Pennsylvania attorney Philip Berg in August and Berg followed up by suing in federal court to block Obama’s nomination. The suit was thrown out repeatedly on the grounds that Berg lacked standing and the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately refused to hear his appeal. There is no record that Clinton herself or anyone within her campaign ever advanced the charge that Obama was not born in the United States. A review by our fellow fact-checkers at Factcheck.org reported that no journalist who investigated this ever found a connection to anyone in the Clinton organization. Clinton, herself, answered this very accusation after Trump's tweet during an interview with CNN’s Don Lemon. Lemon asked Clinton if she started smear campaigns that Obama was born outside the United States. ""That is – no. That is so ludicrous, Don. You know, honestly, I just believe that, first of all, it’s totally untrue, and secondly, you know, the president and I have never had any kind of confrontation like that,"" Clinton said. ""You know, I have been blamed for nearly everything, that was a new one to me."" We should note that the birther rumor is distinct from the myth about Obama’s religion, which is what got the ball rolling at the Trump event in New Hampshire. Our ruling Trump said that Clinton started the birther movement and ""was all in."" It’s an interesting bit of history that the birther movement appears to have begun with Democrats supporting Clinton and opposing Obama. But Trump, and others who have made this claim, neglect to mention that there is no direct tie to Clinton or her 2008 campaign. The story appears to have started with supporters of Clinton, an important distinction. Trump goes on to completely distort the chain of events by claiming Clinton ""was all in"" on the birther movement. Most of the talk started after Clinton suspended her presidential campaign. And the only thing she officially has ever done is deny any accusation of starting a whisper campaign. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B37E00>],/factchecks/2015/sep/23/donald-trump/hillary-clinton-obama-birther-fact-check/

Fact-checking the link between climate change and ISIS
","""Absurd,"" ""embarrassing,"" and ""brazenly silly"" were some of the insults hurled at Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley when he suggested in July that climate change contributed to the rise of ISIS. Despite the derision, the former governor of Maryland continues to stand by his talking point. ""One of the things that preceded the failure of the nation-state of Syria and the rise of ISIS was the effect of climate change and the mega-drought that affected that region, wiped out farmers, drove people to cities, created a humanitarian crisis,"" O’Malley told Bloomberg TV on July 20. Two months later, O’Malley repeated his argument in an interview with the progressive radio show Democracy Now! on Sept. 10: ""Their government could not take care of the basic needs of families in those conditions. Civil war rose up as a result of protest and repression ... then the vacuum to that led to ISIS. So these are the cascading effects that happen in a world that’s very, very connected and in a world where climate change is now creating extreme weather conditions, prolonged droughts."" With recent events -- the pope’s visit highlighting climate change and the United States’ decision to accept more Syrian refugees -- converging on the topic, we were curious if O’Malley’s claim really was ""absurd."" O’Malley’s source A spokesperson for the O’Malley campaign told us that his source was a March 2015 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study, which was well received in its field, does not mention ISIS at all, but its authors told us O’Malley’s extrapolation makes sense. The study found evidence that climate change led to an extreme drought in Syria’s breadbasket between 2006 to 2009. Food prices skyrocketed, nutrition-related diseases became widespread, and 1.5 million internal refugees abandoned their farms and flooded into Syrian cities already crowded with 1.5 million Iraqi refugees displaced by the Iraq war, according to the study. This influx of people exacerbated existing problems like unemployment, corruption and brewing discontent with the regime of Bashar al-Assad, which failed to respond to the situation, according to the study. In 2011, the unrest reached boiling point and erupted into the Syrian uprising. If we follow the sequence of events like O’Malley does, it’s reasonable to say the next fallen domino is the rise of ISIS. ""Once the war had begun all sorts of pre-existing actors took advantage of the situation to pursue their goals -- ISIS was one and the collapse of Syria provided fertile ground for their actions,"" said co-author Richard Seager, a professor of climatology at Columbia University. O’Malley’s campaign also forwarded us many reports and comments from the Department of Defense linking climate change and ISIS. We should also note that the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study is not the first rigorous, academic investigation into the links between climate change and conflict (there’s at least one other on the Syrian conflict alone). Drought’s not the sole culprit In the grander scheme of things, experts say, the drought was just one of many sparks that set the Syrian powder keg ablaze. But both the study and O’Malley acknowledge that and get credit for not overstating climate change’s impact. While climate change may have played an indirect role in the Syrian uprising and ISIS’ rise, other causes – Assad’s recruitment of al-Qaeda members, the genocide against Sunni Arabs, etc.– are direct and ""crystal clear,"" according to Ali Khedery, a former special assistant to five American ambassadors in Iraq. Michael Doran, a senior fellow on Middle East security issues at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, pointed out that unrest in region is not confined to areas suffering from drought. He, however, said that O’Malley’s correct that the drought played a role in generating disaffection.   ""The drought did not cause the Syrian revolution or the fall of Assad,"" said Kenneth Pollack, a senior fellow on Middle East policy at the Brookings Institution. ""A very complex mix of factors did that, but the study suggests that climate change was part of that mix even if we can't tell how important it was."" The study, which Pollack said is garnering a lot of attention among Middle East experts, notes that there is no single cause for conflict, while O’Malley emphasized the ""cascading effects"" of the drought, rather than the drought itself. ""It's fair to say the uprising was going to happen at some point. But the drought did happen when it happened and based on the timing of it, the agricultural collapse and the migration were direct results,"" said study lead author Colin Kelley, a climatologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara. ""The drought creating this chaotic situation also created better opportunity for ISIS to thrive. If you say that in the way (O’Malley) said, it's fair to argue."" Our ruling O’Malley argued that ""the cascading effects"" of climate change contributed to the rise of ISIS The O’Malley campaign referred us to a credible March 2015 study that supports his point. According to the study, a drought in Syria in the 2000s displaced millions of refugees and added to discontent that eventually erupted into war. While the study does not mention ISIS by name, the authors say O’Malley is simply taking their argument one step further. Experts agreed that the drought, spurred by climate change, was one of many factors that led to the Syrian conflict. O’Malley’s phrasing suggests he understands this and is careful not overstate it.

Ben Carson wrong on vaccine claim during second GOP debate
","During the second GOP debate, Dr. Ben Carson backed up previous PolitiFact rulings when he said there is no correlation between vaccines and autism. But the retired pediatric neurosurgeon kept going and prompted another fact-check on the topic when he suggested that there are a ""multitude"" of vaccines that might not be necessary. ""Vaccines are very important. Certain ones,"" Carson said. ""The ones that would prevent death or crippling. There are others, there are a multitude of vaccines which probably don't fit in that category, and there should be some discretion in those cases."" We contacted Carson’s campaign to see what vaccines he meant and his source but did not receive a response. Based on context, in which the candidates were talking about the shots given to children, we decided to look at the vaccines on the childhood schedule supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics and our neighbors at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC recommends a series of shots to protect children against 15 infectious diseases. They are measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Human papillomavirus (HPV), Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib), polio, influenza (flu), rotavirus, and pneumococcal disease. Most everyone likely knows about measles, the flu and the two types of hepatitis – and that all of those diseases can be deadly. But of the others, are any not lethal or, at the least, not crippling? Hardly. Several experts told us no such disease is prevented by those on the childhood immunization schedule. ""Every one of those can kill or cripple or maim you,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrics professor at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and one of three inventors of the rotavirus vaccine. And just what is rotavirus? Think of it as a particularly nasty stomach flu – one estimated to have killed 453,000 children under the age of 5 in 2008, most in developing countries, according to the World Health Organization. The others: Mumps – Death is rare, and happens usually in adults. But complications of childhood mumps include deafness and sterility in both genders. Rubella  – A relatively mild virus that usually leads to severe birth defects and blindness and can cause miscarriage and stillbirth in expectant mothers. Chicken pox – Another relatively mild virus that killed 100-150 children annually before vaccines. Diphtheria – Once a major cause of death among U.S. children – including a record 15,520 in 1921 and the terror behind the original Iditarod sled-dog race in Alaska, this powerful disease killed a 6-year-old boy in Spain last year. Tetanus – This bacteria kills up to 20 percent of those infected, with many suffering from spasms severe enough to break bones. Whooping cough – A brutal disease that killed 20 in 2012, including 15 infants too young for the vaccine. The World Health Organization estimates it caused 89,000 deaths worldwide in 2012. HPV – The more controversial of all vaccines, largely because it prevents a sexually transmitted virus that can cause several types of cancer which can be deadly, even with treatment. HiB – A bacteria that can cause several invasive diseases, including meningitis, which that killed about 1,000 American children annually before vaccines. In 2008, it killed an estimated 199,000 children worldwide. Pneumococcal disease – One of the leading causes of illness in children that kills about 5 percent of those infected and leaves some survivors with permanent injury. ""I would bet that any single one of these vaccines have saved more children than the number of lives Ben Carson has saved as a neurosurgeon,"" said Dr. Adam Lauring, a professor at the University of Michigan medical school who specializes in infectious diseases. ""Because we don’t see many of these diseases anymore, they are almost perceived as inconveniences,"" Lauring continued. ""But fact is, people do die of these diseases and we have forgotten that because we haven’t seen them."" When they do appear, such as with last year’s measles outbreak, they are far less lethal disease than in year’s past. But that is likely a testament to technology and more ready access to healthcare than the fact the diseases remain incapacitating, said Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at NYU’s Langone Medical Center and director of a project on vaccine ethics and policy. ""High-tech medicine to pull you through but you still wouldn’t want to try to survive pneumonia in an artificial respirator in an ICU for weeks,"" Caplan said. ""It’s still devastating."" Our ruling Ben Carson, one of two medical doctors running for the GOP nomination, said during the second Republican debate that there is a ""multitude"" of vaccines for diseases that are not deadly or disabling. The diseases targeted by the vaccines recommended for children on a set schedule, however, are nearly universally lethal. The one obvious exception, rubella, is a disfiguring disease that can lead to birth defects. A medical doctor would surely know that. We rate Carson’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967F0F40>],/factchecks/2015/sep/23/ben-carson/carson-wrong-vaccine-claim/
"['Islam', 'Religion', 'PunditFact', 'Matthew Dowd']","
Did Pope Francis' namesake St. Francis reach out to Muslims?
","Pope Francis has shown an unusual readiness to take on divisive issues. He has spoken forcefully about the twin threats of global warming and runaway consumerism. The pope has decried the gulf between the haves and the have-nots. ABC News analyst Matthew Dowd said there’s no way to separate the pope’s visit to the United States from the ideological conflicts that dominate the American political scene. ""He's coming in as basically not only a spiritual leader, but a political leader that everybody is going to have to, in the course of that, respond to,"" Dowd said on ABC’s This Week on Sept. 20, 2015. Then, Dowd made passing reference to tensions between the West and the Islamic world and brought up an historical point about Pope Francis. ""He took the name of a saint who basically reached out to Muslims,"" he said. This piqued our curiosity. St. Francis of Assisi lived in the early 1200s during the Crusades, so he might have had contact with the Arab world. The order he founded - the Franciscans -- embraced poverty and service to the poor as the purest expression of Christ’s teachings. He saw animals as his brothers and sisters and is the patron saint of the environment. We decided to dig in on the Muslim angle. Dowd told us he learned this about St. Francis from a number of biographies and articles he’s read over the years. ""St. Francis journeyed to see the sultan in the midst of the Crusades,"" Dowd said. That fits with the historical record, we found. But what St. Francis did during his time with the sultan and the aim of his visit is far less certain. That said, the meaning of ""reaching out to Muslims"" is broad enough to cover Dowd’s statement. As interesting as anything else, we learned that in invoking this episode, Dowd joins a long line of people who have applied various interpretations to this moment in the life of St. Francis. The Fifth Crusade From 1217 until about 1229, various Catholic leaders launched forays into the Middle East. In 1219, Cardinal Pelagius led a crusade against al-Kamil the Sultan of Egypt. The cardinal’s forces seized the city of Damietta and were able to hold it for a time, but not do much more. St. Francis made it to Damietta in July or August 1219. John Tolan is a professor of medieval history at the University of Nantes in France, and the author of St. Francis and the Sultan. Tolan’s book provides this description of what St. Francis did next, taken from a letter written in early 1220 by Jacques de Vitry, the bishop of Acre who was in the Damietta encampment at the time. ""He was so inflamed with zeal for the faith that he did not fear to cross the lines to the army of our enemy. For several days he preached the Word of God to the Saracens and made little progress. The Sultan, king of Egypt, privately asked him to pray to the Lord for him, so that he might be inspired by God to adhere to that religion which most pleased God."" We found no dispute that St. Francis indeed spent a few days with the sultan. Another historian, Lawrence Cunningham, professor emeritus of theology at the University of Notre Dame and the author of Francis of Assisi: Performing the Gospel of Life, said in a 2006 interview that there’s other evidence of the meeting. ""My book mentions an Arabic inscription in stone in a Cairo museum that recounts the caliph spoke to Western holy men,"" Cunningham said. ""You also can see in Assisi a gift from the caliph to Francis: a piece of ivory horn on a gold stand."" If meeting with the sultan falls within the meaning of reaching out, then St. Francis reached out to the Muslims. Beyond that, the story gets murky. A range of interpretations Tolan told us no one knows much more than that St. Francis spent time with the sultan and returned safe and sound. ""What the two men said to each other has been a matter of speculation ever since the meeting itself in 1219,"" Tolan said. ""St. Francis has indeed come to represent, for 21st-century Catholics -- especially but not only Franciscans -- a voice for peace and in particular for dialogue with Islam. This was not always so.  For his 13th-century Franciscan hagiographers, he went to Egypt principally because he was hoping to obtain the crown of martyrdom. It is all of course a matter of interpretation, all the more so as Francis himself never wrote anything about Islam."" There are apocryphal stories that the sultan had St. Francis walk over a bed of crosses, or even challenged him to walk over a bed of coals. These are later embellishments to the tale. In his book and a shorter article, Tolan wrote that over the centuries, St. Francis has been cast as ""a scholastic theologian proving the truth of Christianity, a champion of  the crusading ideal, a naive and quixotic wanderer, a crazed religious fanatic, or a medieval Gandhi preaching peace, love and understanding."" Paul Moses, a professor of English at Brooklyn College, wrote the book The Saint and the Sultan: The Crusades, Islam and Francis of Assisi's Mission of Peace. Moses agrees with other researchers that St. Francis’s main goal was to convert the sultan to Christianity. That was certainly the presumption at the time, based on the letter from the bishop of Acre. Cunningham at Notre Dame also assumes that was the goal. But Moses sees evidence that St. Francis represented more. ""Upon his return home, Francis advocated a revolutionary new way for his friars to interact with Muslims, Moses said. ""Rather than preach at them, he said, they could just live peacefully among them and even ‘be subject’ to them. So here he is reaching out not just to the sultan but to Muslims in general."" Moses pointed us to the Early Rule, St. Francis’s first recorded guide for members of his order. In it, St. Francis says friars who go to the land of ""the Saracens and other nonbelievers"" can choose to act in two ways: ""One way is not to engage in arguments or disputes but to be subject to every human being for God's sake and to acknowledge that they are Christians. The other way is to announce the Word of God, when they see it pleases the Lord, in order that (unbelievers) may believe in almighty God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, the Creator of all, the Son, the Redeemer and Savior, and be baptized and become Christians because no one can enter the kingdom of God without being reborn of water and the Holy Spirit."" For Moses, the first option in particular speaks to a sort of religious tolerance. In contrast, Tolan describes the relevant section as ""basically a string of gospel citations"" that is ""quite ambiguous."" Our ruling Dowd said that Pope Francis’ namesake, St. Francis, reached out to Muslims. The historical record tells us that indeed, St. Francis, likely at great personal risk, left the safety of the crusaders’ camp and spent a few days with the Sultan of Egypt. No one actually knows what the two men said to each other. From all that we read and heard from historians, the presumption is that St. Francis tried to convert the sultan. Over the centuries, depending on the point a person wanted to prove, the story has been presented in different ways. In some versions, St. Francis challenges the Muslims. In others, he is attempting to bridge a religious gulf. The word ""outreach"" can have different meanings. The record doesn’t clarify the nature of the outreach, but, taken broadly, it does confirm that some kind of meeting took place. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B05BC0>],/factchecks/2015/sep/22/matthew-dowd/did-popes-namesake-st-francis-reach-out-muslims/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Hillary Clinton: Recessions more frequent under Republicans than Democrats
","Recently, Hillary Clinton has been making the ultimate pocketbook argument for her candidacy: When there’s a Democrat in the White House, she says, the economy does better. Earlier in this campaign season, she said the stock market does better under Democrats. In a speech to the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention on Sept. 19, Clinton went even further. ""I know it’s inconvenient for our Republican friends, but the facts do speak for themselves,"" the former secretary of state said. ""Economic growth is stronger under Democratic presidents. Unemployment is lower. The stock market rises faster. Businesses do better, and deficits are smaller. And one of my favorite inconvenient facts is under Republicans, recessions happen four times as frequently as under Democrats."" In this fact-check, we decided to focus the claim that recessions are four times as likely under Republicans as they are under Democrats. A look at the numbers The primary research on this question -- and the source cited by the Clinton campaign when we asked -- comes from a paper written by two Princeton University economists, Alan Blinder and Mark Watson. The paper, published in July 2014, found that the economy tends to do better under Democratic presidents by numerous measures. The authors looked at quarterly economic data from 1947 through mid 2013 and the National Bureau of Economic Research’s official list of recessions and found that Clinton’s claim is pretty much on point. Since 1947, there have been 11 official recessions, totaling 49 recessionary quarters. Of those 49 quarters, just eight occurred under Democratic presidents, compared to 41 under Republicans. So, over the past 65 years, quarters in recession were about five times more common under a Republican president than under a Democratic president. ""Sec. Clinton is correct in her claim,"" Watson, one of the paper’s authors, told PolitiFact. Looking at how many recessions started under Republicans, the difference is even more stark, noted Blinder, the co-author. Of the 11 recessions since 1947, nine under Republicans, compared to just two under Democrats. The paper also looked further back in history to 1875 and found that the trend held, though it was less pronounced. But what does this mean? Economists emphasize, however, that Clinton’s claim needs some additional context. Clinton presumably wants listeners to believe that Republican policies don’t work for the economy. But the research doesn’t necessarily support this contention. There are far too many factors that contribute to the country’s economic health. ""Democrats would no doubt like to attribute the large (Democratic/Republican) growth gap to macroeconomic policy choices, but the data do not support such a claim,"" the Blinder-Watson paper says. In short, the paper found that half of the Democrats’ economic advantage is a result of factors outside the control of the White House, Congress or the Federal Reserve. The other half ""remains a mystery,"" Watson said. ""It seems we must look instead to several variables that are mostly ‘good luck,’ with perhaps a touch of ‘good policy,’"" the report says. One section of the paper (it’s on page 14) gives an overview of booms and busts since World War II. It concludes that it’s difficult to draw a direct line from a president’s fiscal policy positions to economic cycles. For example, defense spending led to prosperity during the Korean War under Democratic President Harry Truman. His successor, Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, ended the war, and thus the prosperity turned into recession. Energy price shocks are another important factor, since they can produce economic downturns. Unfortunately for the Republicans, shocks hit during the presidencies of Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and George W. Bush, compared to just once under a Democrat, Jimmy Carter. The authors add that Democratic presidents have benefited from higher ""total factor productivity,"" which is essentially a measure of technological growth and dynamism. A clear example is the technology boom under Bill Clinton, which produced significant productivity gains. The authors acknowledge that it’s unclear why this has been the case under Democratic presidents. And sometimes the fiscal policy of a previous administration bleeds into the next one -- so just because a recession happened when one president was in office, the prior administration might bear some of the responsibility. While Democratic President Lyndon Johnson saw no recessions, for instance, his administration had to implement anti-inflation policies near the end of his tenure. Those policies contributed to a recession early on in Nixon’s term. Because of all the factors at play, assigning credit for economic results is tricky, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University professor and chief economist for the job site Indeed.com. In fact, it’s possible that causation actually runs the other way. ""It's possible that the public votes in response to economic conditions,"" she added, ""meaning political cycles can follow economic cycles."" Our ruling Clinton said that ""under Republicans, recessions happen four times as frequently as under Democrats."" The numbers back up Clinton’s claim since World War II: Of the 49 quarters in recession since 1947, eight occurred under Democrats, while 41 occurred under Republicans. It’s important to note, however, that many factors contribute to general well-being of the economy, so one shouldn’t treat Clinton’s implication -- that Democratic presidencies are better for the economy -- with irrational exuberance. Clinton is right on the numbers, but her claim needs additional information to put its implication into the proper context. We rate her claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097820940>],/factchecks/2015/sep/22/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-recessions-more-frequent-under-rep/

Mary Mannix says about half of Virginia's rural hospitals run in the red
","Hospital officials from across Virginia flocked to Richmond last week to air concerns about tightening revenues at their facilities. Among them was Mary Mannix, president and CEO of Augusta Health, a rural hospital in Fishersville about 90 miles west of Richmond. Mannix said her facility is on solid financial footing but that many other rural hospitals are not. ""Just about half of rural hospitals operate in the red in Virginia,"" Mannix said at a news conference organized by the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association, a lobbying group. ""They operate at a loss."" The struggles of rural hospitals across the nation have been well reported in recent years. Facing declining population bases and tightening Medicaid reimbursements, many have struggled to remain open and some have shut down, including Lee Regional Medical Center in Southwest Virginia in 2013. Many hospital officials hoped the General Assembly would ease the stress by expanding the state’s Medicaid program to reduce the medically uninsured. Under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, the federal government would pay all of the costs of expanding the program through 2017 and at least 90 percent in the future. Republican lawmakers have blocked the expansion and say Uncle Sam can’t be trusted to pay his promised share.   The debate is sure to continue when the General Assembly convenes in January. The hospital association says it will lobby lawmakers to find solutions to financial problems at hospitals -- although what solutions, the group isn’t saying. In the past, the association has backed Medicaid expansion. So we wondered whether Mannix was correct in saying ""just about half"" of Virginia’s rural hospitals are running in the red. We reached out to Lisa Schwenk, a spokeswoman for Augusta Health, to find the source for Mannix’s statistic. Schwenk referred us to Julian Walker, the spokesman for the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association. Walker sent us a hospital association chart showing that 17 of 37 rural hospitals in Virginia -- or 46 percent --  had operating losses in 2013, the latest year data are available. The chart listed basic ""acute care hospitals"" - facilities  where people get care for illnesses and injuries. It does not include psychiatric, rehabilitative or other specialized medical centers. The underlying information for the hospital association chart comes from Virginia Health Information, an independent, non-profit group that contracts with the Virginia Department of Health to provide information on the cost and quality of health care in the state. The group releases an annual report looking at the operating margins of all hospitals around the state. Michael Lundberg, executive director at Virginia Health Information, sent us a link to the group’s database showing the fiscal 2013 financial results for the hospitals. It lists 36 rural hospitals, 17 of which had a negative operating margin. That comes to 47 percent. In this database, the hospitals were allowed to determine for themselves whether they should be classified as rural or urban. Lundberg also sent us a second batch of data in which hospitals were sorted as rural or urban based on definitions from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. This grouping listed 25 rural hospitals in 2013, 16 of which ran in the red. That comes to 64 percent. By comparison, Lundberg’s figures show that of the 60 urban hospitals in Virginia under the federal definition, 13 had operating losses. That means nearly 22 percent of urban hospitals in the commonwealth had an operating loss in 2013. Our ruling Mannix said about half of the rural hospitals in Virginia are operating at a loss. Figures from the group that tracks hospital finances back her claim and suggest, if anything, her estimate is on the low end. We rate her statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096751EC0>],/factchecks/2015/sep/22/mary-mannix/mary-mannix-says-about-half-virginias-rural-hospit/

Cagle right on law enforcement death count
","Years have passed, but not the collective chill that comes when our minds are drawn back to Sept. 11, 2001. In the days leading up to this year’s 14th anniversary of the terrorists’ attacks, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle issued a press release, urging Georgians to stop to reflect on the critical role that law enforcement officers play in our communities. ""Eighty-three law enforcement officers have died in the line of duty this year,"" Cagle said in the statement issued Sept. 8, ""Twenty-four of them were shot and killed in cold blood."" Those are sobering national statistics, the sort that have been replayed more lately -- the result of angry displays and discourse that have escalated since the August 2014 killing of a black teenager by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. But are the stats accurate? PolitiFact decided to check. We contacted Ben Fry, Cagle’s chief of staff, who said the numbers came from the Officer Down Memorial Page, a resource that he said was recommended by the Georgia Sheriffs Association. The privately run website is dedicated to memorializing police officers who die in the line of duty and is constantly updated. It showed a 2015 death count of 92 by Sunday, Sept. 20, that included seven Georgia law enforcement officers. The causes of death varied. Twenty-eight died from gunfire, two accidentally. Auto and motorcycle accidents claimed 24 lives. Vehicle pursuits killed four, and vehicle assaults three. Heart attacks accounted for 15 deaths, and a fall caused one death. Five law enforcement officers died in 2015 of illnesses related to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, according to the website. Texas and Louisiana have had the most officers die this year, 10 and 9, respectively. The website numbers track those in Cagle’s statement; they’re more current and so higher. We decided to spot check the website’s data against information gathered for the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, as well media reports. The names of officers who die in the line of duty are etched in marble each spring, in conjunction with National Police Week, at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in  Washington D.C. That group keeps up-to-date data on law enforcement deaths and reported 92 on Sunday (identical to what the Officer Down Memorial Page was reporting that day.) We also used Google to verify all seven of the officer deaths in Georgia noted on the Officer Down Memorial Page. This included DeKalb County Police Officer Kevin Toatley, who was killed Saturday night when his patrol car was struck head on by a vehicle traveling in the wrong direction on South Fulton Parkway. The Officer Down Memorial Page, which has data that appears spot on, says that with the count of 92 deaths as of Sept. 20, all law enforcement deaths for 2015 are down 1 percent this year, compared to 2014. Gunfire deaths are down 26 percent; and auto-related deaths, at 36, are up 13 percent. (In May of this year. the FBI released its preliminary stats for 2014 law enforcement deaths in the line of duty. It showed 51 law enforcement officers were feloniously killed, meaning they were killed with ""criminal intent, as opposed to by accident), an increase of  almost 89 percent from 2013 when the death count was 27.  Between 1980 and 2014, an average of 64 law enforcement officers died this way each year. The 2013 death count was the lowest in this 35-year period.) With all the conversation about relations between the police and the communities they serve, that’s valuable information to know, especially when a recent poll by Rasmussen Reports.com suggests that all those discussions may be influencing public thinking. The telephone survey showed that 58 percent of likely U.S. voters believe there’s a war on police in America today. Our conclusion:  In the days leading up to the 9/11 anniversary, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle issued a press release, urging Georgians to stop to reflect on the critical role that law enforcement officers play in our communities. ""Eighty-three law enforcement officers have died in the line of duty this year. Twenty-four of them were shot and killed in cold blood,"" he said. His numbers come from a group that works to diligently track data and pay tribute to law enforcement officers who die in the line of duty. We rate Cagle’s statement True.

Web graphic says Bernie Sanders doesn't support compulsory K-12 education
","As the Democratic primary race between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont heats up, supporters of each candidate have aggressively gone after the other. We recently looked at a graphic circulating on social media, presumably assembled by backers of Sanders, that contrasted the two candidates’ views on a variety of issues. We found that the descriptions were Mostly True about the candidates’ stances on the death penalty and Mostly True about their positions on trade policy. This time we’ll look at a graphic -- this one presumably put together by Clinton backers -- that compares them on a different set of issues. Here, we’ll check the line in the graphic that says, ""supports requiring all children to have a K-12 education."" The chart says ""yes"" for Clinton and ""no"" for Sanders. (We asked the Clinton campaign if they wanted to comment, but they declined, saying that they had not produced the graphic.) We had no difficulty tracking down the source of this claim, since the chart cites an article in the liberal magazine Mother Jones. Recently, the magazine has published a few articles reviewing Sanders’ early history in politics and activism. In one, Mother Jones tracked down some of Sanders’ writings from a now-defunct newspaper called the Vermont Freeman. ""Some of his rants bordered on libertarian,"" wrote Mother Jones’ Tim Murphy. In August 1969 in a column titled ""Reflections on a Dying Society,"" Sanders wrote this: It is obvious that in the name of ""public safety"" the State is usurping the rights of free choice in many domains of life. To get (a Federal Housing Authority) loan, one MUST build with specified lumber and materials; to drive an automobile, one MUST have insurance and a car which has no rust going through; to run a farm and sell milk one MUST have a bulk tank; to drive a motorcycle one MUST have a helmet, to cite a few examples. The idea that ALL children MUST attend school until 16 years of age, even if some would rather do other things, is now treated as as given a fact of life as the sunrise. Another Mother Jones article pointed to an article from Seven Days, an alternative weekly in Burlington, Vt., in 1981, shortly after Sanders was elected mayor of Burlington for the first time. The weekly recapped Sanders’ political development and his four statewide races as the nominee of the left-wing Liberty Union Party between 1972 and 1976. ""During his four races for state office as a Liberty Unionist, Sanders called for public takeover of utilities, a guaranteed minimum wage, the abolition of compulsory education, and a radical revision of the nation's tax structure,"" the 1981 article said. In other words, the chart pegs Sanders’ current view on compulsory K-12 education to a column he wrote 46 years ago and to campaigns he ran in the early-to-mid 1970s. That’s pretty weak support. Is there any evidence that Sanders still has the same stance today? His office declined repeated requests to supply an answer, but we found some evidence on our own in Sanders’ legislative record in the Senate. In the previous Congress, Sanders introduced the DIPLOMA Act, which would have authorized grants for disadvantaged youth. The grants would be designed to ensure that ""youth are ready for school,"" ""are engaged and achieving in school,"" and that ""students are ready for postsecondary education at institutions of higher education and 21st century careers."" He also introduced the Supporting Community Schools Act of 2013, which would give local educational agencies tools to transform under-performing schools. The goals of these efforts would be to improve student achievement, to close achievement gaps between groups of students, and to increase student attendance and graduation rates. (Neither measure advanced through committee.) We couldn’t find any recent comments of Sanders opposing compulsory education. Our ruling A chart on the Internet said that Sanders does not support ""requiring all children to have a K-12 education."" However, it bases this claim on writings and campaigns from more than 40 years ago, and more recent legislative evidence indicates that Sanders supports a traditional view of K-12 education. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809727FAC0>],/factchecks/2015/sep/21/viral-image/web-graphic-says-bernie-sanders-doesnt-support-com/

Fact-checking Donald Trump's attack on Carly Fiorina's record at Hewlett-Packard
","The second GOP primary debate became a boardroom brawl at one point, with Donald Trump and Carly Fiorina attacking each other's self-tauted records as successful business executives. Fiorina rattled off her list of accomplishments as the head of Hewlett-Packard -- doubled the size of the company, quadrupled growth and cash flow, tripled its rate of innovation -- only to be summarily dismissed by Trump. ""The company is a disaster and continues to be a disaster,"" Trump said on Sept. 16. ""When Carly says the revenues went up, that's because she bought Compaq. It was a terrible deal, and it really led to the destruction of the company."" ""Honestly, Mr. Trump, I find it quite rich that you would talk about this,"" Fiorina shot back, with her own laundry list of Trump’s failings as as businessman. (We address one of her claims in a separate fact-check.) Trump and Fiorina both talk up their private-sector experience as proof of presidential acumen, so we were curious about Trump’s claim that Fiorina’s business record is exaggerated. The Trump campaign didn’t get back to us. The Compaq merger Fiorina has repeatedly claimed that she doubled the size of HP, referring to the revenues created by the company. But, as Trump says and as we and other fact-checkers have noted, this growth largely stems from the company’s controversial merger with Compaq. Under Fiorina’s direction and after an embittered proxy war, HP bought Compaq for $25 billion in 2002, ""a bold move"" to make the two struggling companies more competitive and in a position to take on then-industry giant IBM. In 2001, HP reported a net revenue of $45.2 billion and Compaq $33.6 billion, according their Securities and Exchange Commission filings, for a combined revenue of $78.8 billion. This may look like growth but, according to experts, it’s inflated and inorganic. ""Revenues will obviously go up after a merger so the real question is whether revenues grew after accounting for the combined revenues of HP and Compaq. Here, this is little to support Carly's statement,"" said Kartik Hosanagar, a professor at the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania. By 2004, Fiorina’s last full year as CEO, total revenues for the merged company were $80 billion. In other words, ""revenues barely grew during that period,"" Hosanagar said.    Fiorina is by no means the first executive to take credit for revenue increases spurred by a merger, pointed out Steve Morrissette, a professor at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. Still, he said, claiming it as growth is ""disingenuous.""   A ‘terrible deal’ We should note that HP has not been ""destroyed"" -- it’s alive and kicking, but the question of the merger’s long-term impact on the company remains somewhat unsettled, even more than a decade after the deal. When the merger was published on Sept. 4 , 2001, HP stock prices plummeted, and fell again when the deal was completed on May 3, 2002. It resulted in 30,000 layoffs, Fiorina’s ousting, a low profit margin ($2.4 billion in 2004, less than 5 percent of the revenues), and lower stock prices. (Fiorina, for her part, has maintained that this is due to the dot-com bubble burst rather than her leadership or the merger.) ""This was a big bet that didn’t pay off, that didn’t even come close to attaining what Fiorina and HP’s board said was in store,"" veteran financial journalist Carol Loomis wrote in Fortune in 2005. Dell’s CEO famously called the merger ""the dumbest deal of the decade."" In recent years, however, some industries watchers have come to view the merger in a better light. The Fiorina campaign forwarded PolitiFact several reports and columns hailing the deal as an ultimate boon. ""Hewlett-Packard Co.’s fiscal third quarter earnings showed a decline in nearly all of its businesses, with one exception: industry standard servers, a segment area that grew in part as a result of H-P’s much-maligned merger with Compaq Computer in 2002,"" according to a column published in August 2015 in the financial news site MarketWatch. Among the ""success"" camp, however, is a substantial number of analysts who say much of the credit should go to the man who replaced Fiorina as CEO, Mark Hurd. ""Ultimately, it turned out to be a good move,"" said Robert Burgelman, a professor at the Stanford School of Business who has studied the merger at length. ""But although the logic of the merger was correct, executing it was difficult. ...Hurd accomplished what Fiorina couldn't."" Still, many experts don’t buy the notion of Fiorina’s foresight or the brilliance of the merger. Morrissette of the Chicago Business School pointed out that HP is currently splitting into two companies. ""Time did not show the merger to be a success,"" he said. ""Most analysts do not consider HP a success story. The company has continued to struggle."" Our ruling Trump said, ""When Carly says the revenues went up, that's because she bought Compaq. It was a terrible deal, and it really led to the destruction of the company."" Though the HP-Compaq merger was almost universally condemned at the time the deal took place, time has made the merger look better in the minds of some. But there’s no question that the growth in HP’s revenue did indeed come from its 2002 merger with Compaq. That means it’s not organic growth, but rather merely due to increase in the volume of the combined company.

Fact-checking claims about Donald Trump's four bankruptcies
","In an effort to take out frontrunner Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidates have pelted Trump with criticism over his multiple trips to federal bankruptcy court. That criticism was on full display in CNN’s Republican debate Sept. 16. Most notably, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina criticized Trump’s history of bankruptcies in his businesses. ""You know, there are a lot of us Americans who believe that we are going to have trouble someday paying back the interest on our debt because politicians have run up mountains of debt using other people's money,"" Fiorina said. ""That is in fact precisely the way you ran your casinos. You ran up mountains of debt, as well as losses, using other people's money, and you were forced to file for bankruptcy not once, not twice, four times."" Trump doesn’t deny that four of his businesses have filed for bankruptcy. He argues, however, that filing for bankruptcy is a common business decision, and he was smart to make the moves when he did. ""Hundreds of companies"" have filed for bankruptcy, Trump said earlier in the debate. ""I used the law four times and made a tremendous thing. I'm in business. I did a very good job."" Trump’s four bankruptcies were Chapter 11 reorganizations (named for its location in federal bankruptcy code), which are designed to restructure businesses without shutting them down completely. The purpose is to ""save"" the business, as opposed to other forms of bankruptcy which would liquidate the company, said Michael Venditto, a partner at the ReedSmith law firm who has extensive experience with Chapter 11. Because they keep coming up, we decided to outline Trump’s four bankruptcies. We also talked to some finance experts, who told us Trump is correct that Chapter 11 reorganization is not always the result of bad business decisions. Bankruptcy 1: The Trump Taj Mahal, 1991 The first bankruptcy associated with Trump was perhaps the most significant in terms of his personal finances, according to news reports at the time. He funded the construction of the $1 billion Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, which opened in 1990. By 1991, the casino was nearly $3 billion in debt, while Trump had racked up nearly $900 million in personal liabilities, so the business decided to file for Chapter 11 reorganization, according to the New York Times. As a result, Trump gave up half his personal stake in the casino and sold his yacht and airline, according to the Washington Post. Bankruptcy 2: Trump Plaza Hotel, 1992 Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in New York for $390 million in 1988. By 1992, the hotel had accumulated $550 million in debt. As a result of the bankruptcy, in exchange for easier terms on which to pay off the debts, Trump relinquished a 49 percent stake in the Plaza to a total of six lenders, according to ABC News. Trump remained the hotel’s CEO, but it was merely a gesture -- he didn’t earn a salary and had no say in the hotel’s day-to-day operations, according to the New York Times.  Bankruptcy 3: Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts, 2004 Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy again in 2004 when his casinos -- including the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Marina and Trump Plaza casinos in Atlantic City and a riverboat casino in Indiana -- had accrued an estimated $1.8 billion in debt, according to the Associated Press. Trump agreed to reduce his share in the company from 47 to 27 percent in a restructuring plan, but he was still the company’s largest single shareholder and remained in charge of its operations. Trump told the Associated Press at the time that the company represented less than 1 percent of his net worth. Bankruptcy 4: Trump Entertainment Resorts, 2009 Trump Entertainment Resorts -- formerly Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts -- was hit hard by the 2008 economic recession and missed a $53.1 million bond interest payment in December 2008, according to ABC News. After debating with the company’s board of directors, Trump resigned as the company’s chairman and had his corporate stake in the company reduced to 10 percent. The company continued to use Trump’s name in licensing. So four Trump companies filed for Chapter 11 reorganization. Is that as big a deal as Fiorina says? Risky business While it would be better to avoid a situation where Chapter 11 reorganization is necessary, filing for bankruptcy can be a ""sound business decision"" when the company is facing serious financial problems, Venditto said. It’s better than the business shutting down completely. ""However, the source of the financial problems varies from case to case,"" he said. ""Sometimes it is the result of circumstances beyond the control of the business. Sometime it caused by poor judgment. More frequently, it is a combination."" Trump’s four bankruptcies all happened within the past 25 years. That’s a lot, said Stephen Lubben, a leading expert in corporate finance and professor at Seton Hall School of Law. But to be fair, the gaming industry has been struggling the past few years, he added, and three out of four of Trump’s bankruptcies were tied to casinos. It’s not fair to put all the blame on Trump for the four bankruptcies because he’s acting as any investor would. Investors often own many non-integrated companies, which they fund by taking on debt, and some of them inevitably file for bankruptcy, said Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown University. He added that people typically wouldn’t personally blame former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney or investor Warren Buffett for individual failures within their investment companies, Bain Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, respectively. ""The only difference is that Trump puts his name on his companies, which means people associate them with him, but he's not at all the leader in the bankruptcy space,"" Levitan said. ""These bankruptcies were not defining moments for Trump and shouldn't color our view of him."" Our ruling Fiorina said Trump was ""forced to file for bankruptcy not once, not twice, four times."" While it is accurate that Trump filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy four times, Fiorina’s statement doesn’t tell the whole story. In context, Fiorina’s phrasing suggests Trump was personally responsible for the failures of these businesses, but in reality, much was out of Trump’s control -- such as a struggling casino industry. But Trump is certainly not blameless. We rate Fiorina’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971F91C0>],/factchecks/2015/sep/21/carly-fiorina/trumps-four-bankruptcies/

Even the EPA says Obama carbon plan will only marginally affect climate change, Scott Walker says
","When the second Republican presidential debate took up climate change, Gov. Scott Walker made a counterintuitive claim about President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which requires the nation’s power plans to reduce their carbon emissions by nearly a third. About midway into the Sept. 16, 2015 debate, held in California, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was expressing concerns to moderator Jake Tapper about higher utility rates and fewer jobs. That's when Walker interjected and said: ""A lot of those people, though, and I'm going to echo what Senator Rubio just said. This is an issue where, we're talking about my state, it's thousands of manufacturing jobs. Thousands of manufacturing jobs for a rule the Obama administration, (its) own EPA has said will have a marginal impact on climate change."" Walker’s campaign confirmed to us that the governor was referring to the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, and to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. There are differences of opinion, of course, over how much one plan in one country can affect the global climate. But to Walker’s claim: Did the EPA -- the agency administering the Clean Power Plan -- say the plan’s regulations would have only a marginal effect on climate change? The plan In August 2015, the Obama administration announced that its Clean Power Plan regulations would require power plants to reduce carbon emissions, from 2005 levels, by 32 percent by 2030. (A 2014 draft of the plan had sought a 30 percent reduction.) Advocates said the reduction would help attack global warming and provide reductions in other emissions that create soot and smog. But the announcement prompted Walker to add Wisconsin to states that are challenging the first-ever requirements in court. The reductions won't be uniform, because individual states rely on different mixes of coal, natural gas, nuclear energy, water, wind and the sun to provide power. Wisconsin, which has traditionally relied heavily on coal, faces having to reduce emissions 34 percent-- the sixth-highest rate in the country, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. EPA’s view As for the the EPA, it has described the Clean Power Plan as a necessary, though not sufficient, step in addressing climate change -- and as part of a larger strategy to spur other nations to reduce emissions. During a July 2015 congressional hearing, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, challenged EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy on the impact on climate change. The Texas Republican quoted a former EPA assistant secretary under Obama as saying the plan would, at most, reduce the global temperature by 1/100 of a degree Celsius. McCarthy responded by saying that the value of the plan can’t be measured that way. She said that while the plan mandates carbon emission reductions in the United States, it also aims to prod other nations to reduce their emissions and to trigger investment in technological innovations that also will reduce emissions. The value of the plan is ""in showing strong domestic action, which can actually trigger global action,"" McCarthy said. ""(I’m) not disagreeing that this action in and of itself will not make all the difference we need to address climate action. But what I'm saying is if don't take action domestically, we will never get started."" (Separately, EPA spokeswoman Liz Purchia told us the agency has said the Clean Power Plan ""is only one component of our larger strategy,"" which includes measures for vehicle fuel efficiency and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.) During the same hearing, there were fears expressed that the plan will drive up the cost of electricity to consumers. And U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., expressed concern that China, India and Russia would not reduce the growth in their carbon emissions. So, the head of the EPA acknowledges that the Clean Power Plan -- since it applies only to the United States -- can have only a limited impact on global climate change. But besides reducing carbon emissions in the United States, the plan is aimed at getting other nations to do the same. Other views We interviewed two experts about the Clean Power Plan and the EPA’s take on it: Adele Morris of the Brookings Institution’s Climate and Energy Economics Project, and Chip Knappenberger of the Cato Institute’s Center for the Study of Science. Both agreed that the United States historically is a major emitter of carbons, but growing nations such as India and China will play a larger role in future emissions. And they agreed that a key part of the EPA’s strategy with the Clean Power Plan is that as a global leader, if the United States reduces emissions, other nations might be spurred to do so, as well. Other experts have made the same point. ""This appears to be an intentionally obfuscating perspective,"" Dallas Burtraw, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future a think tank that tracks energy policy, said of Walker's claim. ""Climate change is a global problem. The contribution of U.S. efforts are greater, in my mind, for the influence they have on the behavior of the other nations of the world than for the specific reductions that the U.S. achieves. The greater contribution is leadership in this case."" In June 2015 -- five months before a United Nations summit meeting aimed at forging a global accord to cut climate-warming emissions -- China submitted a plan to the U.N. detailing how it plans to reduce fossil fuel emissions by 2030. The New York Times reported that climate policy experts cited the significance of China’s plan, given that the United States and China -- the world’s top greenhouse gas polluters -- have long been viewed as the biggest obstacles to reaching a meaningful global warming deal. Our rating In the debate, Walker said the Obama administration’s ""own Environmental Protection Agency"" has said its Clean Power Plan ""will have a marginal impact on climate change."" The EPA acknowledges that the plan can have only a limited effect on global climate change, given that they order reductions in carbon emission only in the United States. But a key aim of the plan is to spur other nations to reduce their emissions, as well, and to spur new technologies that will help reduce emissions.

""There is no justice, and I want you to hear this clearly, when the top 1/10th of 1 percent -- not 1 percent -- the top 1/10th of 1 percent today in America owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent,"" Sanders told the crowd, packed into the Vines Center arena for weekly convocation. ""And in your hearts, you will have to determine the morality of that, and the justice of that."" We decided to examine Sanders’ statement that the richest 0.1 percent has nearly as much as the bottom 90 percent. It’s a standard line in Sanders’ speeches. Warren Gunnels, policy director of Sanders’ presidential campaign, said the senator’s source for the statistic is a Nov. 13, 2014, article in The Guardian, a British newspaper. As our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin have written, the article reported on the findings of a research paper, about wealth inequality during the past 100 years. The study was commissioned by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonpartisan organization in Cambridge, Mass., which is best known as the arbiter for determining when the U.S. economy falls into recession. The authors of the study were economists Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, and Gabriel Zucman of the London School of Economics. Using tax records, they made estimates for 2012 on wealth -- that is, the value of all assets, such as a home, and savings and retirement accounts, minus all debts, such as mortgages and credit card balances. The top 0.1 percent included 160,000 families with net assets of at least $20 million.  Meanwhile, the bottom 90 percent encompassed 144 million families with average wealth of $84,000. That report says wealth concentration among the richest Americans followed a U-shaped pattern during the past century. It was high in the beginning of the 20th century and then fell from 1929 to 1978. But the study found that wealth concentration among the richest has been rising since, fueled in particular by gains held by the wealthiest 0.1 percent families. The families in that echelon saw their share rise from 7 percent of total household wealth in the late 1970s to 22 percent in 2012. The bottom 90 percent’s share of the nation’s wealth fell from 35 percent in the mid-1980s to 23 percent in 2012. Two other prominent economists -- Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics and Edward Wolff of New York University -- have said the study makes solid estimates about wealth inequality. Wolff said he was not aware of another study that examined the wealth of the top 0.1 percent. But not all economists think the NBER study is the best way to measure wealth. Richard Burkhauser, a professor of policy analysis at Cornell University, told PolitiFact Wisconsin that while Saez and Zucman are ""very well respected economists,"" he faults their study for excluding Social Security income. ""To ignore it as they do grossly understates the wealth held by Americans in the bottom 99 percent of the population,"" Burkhauser said. Almost 60 million Americans - mostly retired and disabled workers - receive Social Security benefits averaging $1,223 a month, according to the Social Security Administration. Another criticism of the NBER study is that it doesn't take into account changes in tax laws, according to Alan Reynolds, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute. In a July 9, 2014, op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Reynolds wrote that new tax laws in the 1980s and ’90s skew the increase in wealth inequality. Those laws, he said, required that more capital income of high-earning taxpayers be reported on individual returns, while excluding most capital income of middle-income savers and homeowners. The Tax Policy Center in Washington estimates that 42 percent of all capital gains and dividends reported to the IRS for 2014 came from the top 0.1 percent. Put another way: Of roughly $722 billion in total capital gains and dividends reported, about $305 billion were filed by the top echelon of earners. The center also estimates that the top 0.1 percent paid slightly more than half of all capital gains and dividend taxes collected for 2014. They paid about $70 billion of the $138 billion generated through the levies. Our ruling Sanders said the top 0.1 percent of Americans have nearly as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. His claim accurately echoes findings in a study by two internationally known economists, and their work has been widely cited as authoritative.  But it needs a clarification: Some economists say the study underestimates middle-class wealth by excluding Social Security benefits and not fully considering certain tax laws. With that qualification in mind, we rate Sanders’ statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B18D80>],/factchecks/2015/sep/21/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-top-01-us-have-almost-much-wea/
"['Ohio', 'Public Service', 'William G. Batchelder']","
William Batchelder says his service career ranks No. 2 for longevity in the Ohio House
","
State Rep. William G. Batchelder was re-elected speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives when the General Assembly met for the first time Jan. 7. The Medina Republican reviewed the work of the previous two-year assembly in traditional opening remarks, and he also mentioned an achievement of his own:

""It has been my privilege to serve in the Ohio House of Representatives for more than 35 years,"" he said, ""and I understand that I am now the No. 2 member of this House in terms of length of service.""

It's a noteworthy distinction, but it brought a question to PolitiFact Ohio: if Batchelder's claim is true, how is it possible in a state with term limits?

We dug into the record.

First, Batchelder was correct. He was elected to the House in 1968, starting his first term in 1969, and served until 1999. Elected again in 2006, he was re-elected to his fourth consecutive two-year term last November -- making him the most senior member of the House and giving him its second-longest tenure in state history.

The longest-serving member was Robert Netzley, a Republican from southwest Ohio who died in 2010. He served 40 years until retiring in 2000, when he was term-limited. The longest serving member of the Senate was Ted Gray, who served a total of 43 years and retired in 1994.

Ohio's term limits were approved by voters through a constitutional amendment in 1992 and became effective in 2000.

They limit House members to four two-year terms, an eight-year cap, and state senators to two four-year terms, also eight years.

There is no lifetime limit on terms. The cap is on consecutive terms, and the clock is reset when a member leaves the House or Senate. Nor is there a restriction or waiting period on jumping from one chamber to the other.

An analysis by the Toledo Blade last July found that 18 active members of the total 132 in the General Assembly had served more than eight uninterrupted years in Columbus by making at least one jump between chambers.

Rep. Ron Amstutz of Wooster, a budget expert who was named as the lawmaker with the longest consecutive service in the term limits era, has been in office for 32 years. He first ran successfully for the House in 1980.

Batchelder, who left the House for a judgeship in 1999, now has served for more than 35 years. He has never served in the Senate. Term limits will prevent him from seeking another House term in 2014.

And on the Truth-O-Meter, his claim about ranking No. 2 for length of service in the Ohio House rates as True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F60D80>],/factchecks/2013/jan/18/bill-batchelder/william-batchelder-says-his-service-career-ranks-n/
"['Georgia', 'Children', 'Guns', 'College presidents']","
College presidents weigh in on gun deaths of young people
","
Five days after shootings in Newtown, Conn., left 28 people dead -- including 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary -- leaders at two of Georgia’s higher education institutions weighed in on the gun safety debate.

Leaders of Oglethorpe University and Agnes Scott College  -- both are in DeKalb County -- released an open letter pushing for stricter gun safety legislation. It was initially co-signed by more than 160 other college and university presidents nationwide, including Atlanta’s Morehouse and Spelman colleges and Clark Atlanta University. Oglethorpe President Lawrence M. Schall said he was moved to draft the letter after watching a televised memorial service for Newtown victims.

""For many years now, our nation’s leaders have engaged in fevered debates on higher education, yet lawmakers shy away from taking action on one issue that prevents thousands of young people from living lives of promise, let alone realizing their college dreams. That issue is gun safety,"" the letter reads. "" … In 2010, 2,694 young people were killed by gunfire. 1,773 were victims of homicide; 67 were elementary school-age children. If those children and teens were alive today, they would fill 108 classrooms of 25 each.""

Since the Connecticut shooting, the gun safety debate has come front and center at all levels of government. The White House has rolled out a $500 million gun safety package. State lawmakers are pushing for armed officers in schools. Metro Atlanta school districts have conducted ""active shooter"" lockdown drills for staff and students.

A multitude of statistics has been tossed about by advocates on both sides of the issue to make their points. We wondered if the data used by higher education leaders was accurate. And we were curious how it was compiled.

By the time President Barack Obama unveiled his gun-violence reduction plan this week, the list of higher education co-signers of the gun safety letter had risen to more than 300. The letter has received national attention, with coverage on news outlets including CNN, The Huffington Post, NPR and The Wall Street Journal.

A spokesman for Oglethorpe University said the gun death statistics used in the letter were taken directly from data also used by the Children’s Defense Fund, the Washington, D.C., child-advocacy organization led by Marian Wright Edelman. The data includes figures for children and youths through age 19. In one of her weekly ""Child Watch"" columns last month, Edelman used the same statistics to also implore action on gun violence.

The figures cited by the Children’s Defense Fund are actually data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and available in its WONDER (Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research) online database research system. For its various data, the CDC WONDER system uses information collected from its agency affiliates.

The mortality data used in the gun safety letter is compiled from death certificates issued in each state and recorded by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. That information is then included in the WONDER database. Of note are the types of gun deaths included in the numbers cited. The list of 2,694 young people reportedly killed by gunfire includes those who died of suicide, as well as accidental discharge of a firearm and discharge of a firearm with an undetermined intent.

The CDC’s homicide figure varies slightly from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports for 2010. The FBI crime statistics are produced from data provided by 17,000 law enforcement agencies across the United States. For children and youths through age 19, 1,402 were victims of homicide (it does not include suicide) by gunfire in 2010, according to the FBI crime report. That is similar to the CDC’s figure of 1,773 homicide victims of the same age during the same year.

The FBI and CDC data sets are the two main sources of these types of statistics, said James Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University in Boston. The CDC numbers can be slightly higher because the FBI figures do not include data from every police department in the country (about 92 percent of the departments submit information to the FBI). But the FBI data, which is published annually, is more up to date, Fox said. The lag time for reporting CDC data is about a year longer.

So, are the numbers of child gun deaths cited in the letter from the college and university presidents accurate?

It depends on who collects, compiles and publishes the data, as well as what is included in the numbers. In the case of the CDC data, it is virtually impossible to track down each death certificate from 2010 to verify the cause of death. Based on an examination of the WONDER data, the numbers appear accurate. It is important to note that the figure for the number of children and youths killed by guns three years ago includes causes such as suicides and unintentional discharges.

We rate the college and university presidents’ claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C15F00>],/factchecks/2013/jan/18/college-presidents/college-presidents-weigh-gun-deaths-young-people/
"['Rhode Island', 'History', 'State Budget', 'Lincoln Chafee']","
Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee says he submitted his state budget proposal earlier than any governor in the past two decades
","
Just 16 days into the new year, Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee went before the General Assembly to offer his third State of the State address and talk about his proposed $8.2-billion 2013-2014 budget.

Earlier in the day he released details of his budget package to the media and by the next day, his complete budget had been posted online.

During his Jan. 16 speech to members of the House and Senate, Chafee declared, ""I submit this budget to the General Assembly on Jan. 16th – on time and the earliest that a governor has done so in over two decades.""

State law requires governors to submit their budgets to the legislature by the third Thursday in January (or the first Thursday in February if it's their first year in office). Chafee beat that deadline by one day.

Submitting a budget early sounds like a good thing. At a briefing for reporters, Chafee’s director of administration, Richard Licht, said the early submittal reflected the discipline the governor has tried to bring to the whole budget process. And it will give the General Assembly more time to analyze it properly.

We wondered whether Chafee's claim that his budget is the earliest to be submitted in more than two decades was true.

We called his office to ask for their evidence.

Meanwhile, we turned to the always-helpful Thomas Evans, the state librarian.

Evans doesn't keep track of when a governor's budget is released, but he had data for when governors gave their State of the State/budget addresses and when their proposed budgets were submitted as legislation.

It turns out, there can be a big gap between the two. For example, in 1989, the second year on Evans' list, Gov. Edward DiPrete addressed the General Assembly on Jan. 4, yet his budget bill wasn't introduced until March 1.

In the previous 25 years, no governor has submitted a budget bill by the original deadline set by state law, according to Evans' data. (Extensions were written into the law for budgets submitted from 2005-2007 and for 2011 and 2012). Usually submission comes sometime in February. In eight years it was in March and in one year -- 1991 when Gov. Bruce Sundlun was dealing with the banking crisis -- it came April 9.

We confirmed Evans’ dates using The Journal's archives and found that details of the budget are usually released a day or two before the budget bill is introduced.

""The earliest the budget bill itself has been submitted in the last 25 years is Feb. 1,"" said Evans. That was in 2005 and 2007 (during the administration of Gov. Donald Carcieri) and 2012 (Chafee's second year).

Chafee's budget bill is on his website and Chafee spokeswoman Christine Hunsinger said it has been sent to the House.

However, it has not been officially introduced and referred to a committee for analysis.

Said Hunsinger: ""We hope they will introduce it Tuesday,""

That would be Jan. 22, still ten days earlier than the previous record.

We rate Chafee's claim True.

"['New Jersey', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie says current fiscal year income tax receipts higher than projected, before Sandy
","Gov. Chris Christie made some ambitious financial predictions in 2012, generating both praise and controversy.

Perhaps the boldest claim? New Jersey’s revenues would rise 8.4 percent for the current fiscal year that began July 1, a forecast criticized by Wall Street analysts and New Jersey Democrats.

But Christie has held firm on his forecast and discussed what he said is the state’s improving economic news during his Jan. 8 State of the State address in Trenton.

""Gross income tax receipts are exceeding the Administration’s projections for this fiscal year prior to Sandy,"" Christie said, citing other accomplishments such as job growth and increases in both consumer spending and industrial production.

Looking strictly at numbers, the governor’s claim is accurate.

New Jersey operates on a fiscal year that starts July 1 and ends June 30. Since Christie’s comment references the current fiscal year and the months before Hurricane Sandy, which hit the state on Oct. 29, 2012, we’re looking at gross income tax revenue for July through October, and comparing it with the same months in 2011.

For the current fiscal year, there was no growth in income tax revenue through August, with receipts falling nearly 1 percent to $780 million from $786 million the year before, according to a monthly report produced by the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services to track growth and decline in state revenue.

Things changed in September, when fiscal year-to-date income tax receipts climbed to $1.8 billion from $1.7 billion the year before.

""Income tax collections remain strong as the State’s economy continues to grow,"" state Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff said in a September news release about the revenue growth.

Fiscal year-to-date revenue through October jumped 9.8 percent to $2.69 billion from $2.45 billion for the same period a year ago, thanks to an extra payday that month and delayed tax payments.

Here’s why October’s revenue jump was so high.

Employers in New Jersey pay withholding taxes to the state every Wednesday, generating between $100 million to $150 million, said David Rosen, chief budget officer for the OLS. October happened to have five Wednesdays, meaning an extra $100 million or so in revenue for the state.

Another accounting shift resulted in a $60 million increase because of Tropical Storm Irene.

When Irene hit in late August 2011, taxpayers were given until Oct. 30 to make their quarterly tax payment normally due in September. That payment was to generate $60 million for the state. As a result of the deadline extension, the money didn’t show up in the state accounting system until November. So, the October ledger was minus $60 million.

The October 2012 ledger, however, shows $60 million because the usual Sept. 15 tax payment deadline applied this year and the money ended up in state coffers on time.

""Combined, these two effects artificially boost the current cash flow by about $160 million compared to last year’s baseline,"" the October 2012 OLS revenue report states.

So technically, there was growth in income tax receipts -- with some help from bookkeeping measures.

""The statement is literally true,"" Rosen said of Christie’s claim.

Treasury data showed similar growth in gross income tax receipts, but other revenue accounts aren’t doing as well, according to numbers from both the Treasury and OLS. Overall, New Jersey faces a shortfall of $425.9 million for the first six months of the fiscal year. Adding in money left over from last year, the total shortall is $549 million.

Christie spokesmen Michael Drewniak and Kevin Roberts did not respond to a request for comment.

Our ruling

During his State of the State address last week, Christie said, ""Gross income tax receipts are exceeding the Administration’s projections for this fiscal year prior to Sandy.""

Looking at the current fiscal year, year-to-date gross income tax revenue increased year-over-year in September and October -- even though October’s significant growth resulted primarily because of an extra payday that month and an accounting measure.

"['Ohio', 'Bipartisanship', 'Tom Niehaus']","
Tom Niehaus says 80 percent of the bills passed last Ohio Senate session were carried by bipartisan votes
","
Before he passed the gavel to his successor on Jan. 7, former Ohio Senate President Tom Niehaus recorded a farewell speech that put a positive spin on the Senate’s accomplishments under his leadership.

The 90-second speech touched on job creation, pension reform and bipartisanship.

""Unlike the gridlock in Washington, more than 80 percent of the bills we passed during this General Assembly had bipartisan support,"" Niehaus said in the online video, which was shared with reporters on Jan. 3.

Niehaus, a Republican from Clermont County, was Senate President for the 129th General Assembly, which included 2011 and 2012. Term limits prevented him from running for re-election.

Recalling that lawmakers debated many contentious issues the past two years, including collective bargaining reform, bills expanding gun rights, bills dealing with abortion and election law reform, PolitiFact Ohio checked out Niehaus’ claim of cooperation.

Niehaus spokeswoman Angela Meleca cited 191 of the 241 bills the Senate passed in the last two years that had bipartisan support. According to Meleca’s figures, the bills with bipartisan support represent just over 79 percent of the total bills passed.

Meleca said the Senate clerk’s office provided the figures and Vincent Keeran, the Senate clerk, confirmed the figures.

Bills were considered to have bipartisan support if the majority of Senate Democrats supported the legislation, Keeran said. With 10 Democratic senators, that means bills must have received at least six Democratic votes to be considered bipartisan.

Senate Democratic Leader Eric Kearney’s office did not dispute the figures. But a spokesman for Kearney said Democrats were not always included in shaping high-profile bills, such as Senate Bill 5, the attempt to restrict public employees’ collective bargaining power.

""A lot of the really important ones they push through probably didn’t"" have bipartisan support, said Kearney spokesman Mike Rowe.

Rowe’s point is well taken – SB 5, for example, received zero Democratic votes – but Niehaus did not claim bipartisanship on specific bills.

Niehaus’ claim was that more than 80 percent of the bills the Senate passed had bipartisan support. The actual numbers showed about 79 percent had bipartisan support. But while Niehaus didn’t hit the number on the nose, the driving point behind his claim certainly is accurate.

The senator’s point was that the two parties worked together and avoided gridlock.And since the threshold for bipartisanship is that a majority of Democrats support the bill, there clearly was bipartisan support for a significant amount of legislation.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Niehaus’ claim rates True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B156C0>],/factchecks/2013/jan/17/tom-niehaus/tom-niehaus-says-80-percent-bills-passed-last-ohio/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says Texas education spending increased a phenomenal 70 percent as enrollment escalated 23 percent
","
Asked about restoring public education aid, Gov. Rick Perry suggested that’s the wrong question.

According to a Jan. 9, 2013, Texas Tribune news story, Perry replied at a press conference earlier that day: ""We’ve had public education funding growing at three times the public education enrollment. So you’ve had a 70 percent increase of funding from 2002 to 2012. You've had a 23 percent increase in enrollment... I think under any scenario over the last decade, the funding that we have seen in the state of Texas for public education has been pretty phenomenal.""

Those contrasting figures seemed surprising given that the revenue-strapped 2011 Legislature modified school finance formulas--sending schools $4 billion less than if the formulas had stayed the same--and also made other school funding cuts. We were mindful, too, of other flawed education spending claims. Of note, Republican lawmakers have said Texas did not cut such spending (Pants on Fire), that they raised education spending (Pants on Fire) and also that they raised education’s share of the budget (Mostly True).

Enrollment increased about 20 percent from 2001-02 to 2011-12, from more than 4.1 million to nearly 5 million students, according to a December 2012 report by the Texas Education Agency. By email, agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us 2012-13 enrollment is expected to exceed 5 million, but the total has not been settled.

And how much did spending increase or decrease during the period?

To find out, we measured spending on public schools in two ways: how much spending from all sources--state, local and federal--changed and how much the state itself spent.

Overall expenditures

Overall school expenditures, counting state, local and federal sources, totaled $27.9 billion in 2002 and $44.2 billion in 2012, according to a chart from the Legislative Budget Board, which tracks fiscal issues for lawmakers.

That makes for a difference of 58 percent, though that’s also before adjusting for inflation, which the board’s staff did by converting figures to 2004 dollars using an inflation adjuster devised by the federal government, the Implicit Price Deflator for State and Local Government.

In 2004 dollars, Texas public school spending in 2002 totaled $30.1 billion. In 2012, the total was $33.3 billion--11 percent greater than in 2002.

By this measure, then, it looks like school enrollment went up faster than spending.

Then again, we learned, these figures were not behind Perry’s statement.

State spending alone

Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us by email that Perry was referring to the difference in state education spending alone ""as those are the funds the state has control over.""

The budget board’s chart shows $10.9 billion in state spending on the schools in 2002 and $18.9 billion in 2012, for a 73 percent difference, or a little more than Perry’s declared 70 percent.

Adjusting for inflation, though, reduces the increase to 20 percent. In 2004 dollars, such spending was $14.2 billion in 2012, compared to $11.8 billion in 2002.

Analyst Eva DeLuna Castro of the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities and school lobbyist Lynn Moak, a former Texas Education Agency official, each pointed out another wrinkle, suggesting that any consideration of state education spending should take into account changes in law approved in 2006 resulting in the state picking up about $7 billion more in annual costs in return for school districts cutting local maintenance & operation property tax rates.

Castro said by email: ""The property tax cut was $14.2 billion a biennium, or $7.1 billion every year. That means the state had to put in that amount of money a year to offset local property taxes falling by the same amount.""

The shift in funding sources did not, in itself, step up aid received by the schools, Castro said.

Moak said by phone: ""This was simply a source-of-funds transfer.""

To adjust for the annual cost shift, we subtracted $7.1 billion from the state spending in 2012, suggesting a $0.9 billion difference from the 2002 spending. However, adjusting for inflation makes the 2012 state spending equal $8.2 billion in 2002 dollars--25 percent less than the $10.9 billion spent in 2002.

We asked Frazier about taking inflation and the tax-swap law into consideration. She replied by email: ""The governor has laid out the accurate facts.""

Our ruling

Perry said education spending escalated more than three times as fast as enrollment from 2002 to 2012.

We accept that he was talking about state education aid, which outpaced the 20 percent growth in enrollment by about the cited margin. 
But that’s without considering inflation and the impact of the annual tax swap set in motion by lawmakers and Perry, which drove up state spending without in itself delivering more school aid. Make those adjustments and it looks like Texas schools in 2012 fielded 25 percent less in state aid than what they fielded in 2002.

We rate this claim as False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096870340>],/factchecks/2013/jan/16/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-education-increased-phenomen/
"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio says only 6.5 percent of immigrants ""come here based on labor and skill""
","
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is a key to the Republicans’ hope to capture more of the Hispanic vote in 2016. And to achieve that goal, Rubio -- a potential presidential contender -- wants to be the face of the GOP’s immigration plans.

Rubio unveiled his plan for immigration legislation in the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 12. Rubio’s plan calls for allowing more immigrants into the country who bring investment or skills, a guest-worker program for farm laborers and a path to citizenship for certain  people in the United States illegally.

Rubio sees his immigration plan as something that can spur economic growth.

""I'm a big believer in family based immigration,"" Rubio told the Journal. ""But I don't think that in the 21st century we can continue to have an immigration system where only 6.5 percent of people who come here, come here based on labor and skill. We have to move toward merit and skill-based immigration.""

That precise figure -- 6.5 percent -- caught our attention, so we decided to check it out.

Brookings policy brief

Rubio obtained the 6.5 percent figure from a January 2011 policy brief from the Brookings Institution, a centrist think tank. The author, Brookings vice president Darrell West, called for immigration reform that in the short term would allow employers to hire workers with scientific and technological skills.

West argued that some other countries such as Canada have already crafted policies to attract skilled and unskilled workers. Canada gives applicants points based on their field of study, education and employment experience.

""Some 36 percent of all Canadian immigrant visas are in the ‘skilled-worker’ category, as opposed to only 6.5 percent in the United States,"" West wrote. We contacted West to ask how he arrived at his figure.

West told us in an email that there are different numbers depending on the immigrant category and the definition of skilled workers. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security publishes numbers that relate to ""legal permanent residents"" and how many are family sponsored or employment-based.

""But even those numbers are not exact, because the employment category combines skilled and unskilled workers,"" West wrote.  ""My 6.5 percent figure was my best approximation of the conflicting numbers that exist in this area.""

We looked at the numbers ourselves and found the vast majority of immigrants are accepted for family unification and a smaller slice are for employment, though the numbers vary depending on the type of visa and employment.

West’s number drew from a group known as legal permanent residents. In 2011, a total of 1,062,040 persons became legal permanent residents. Family sponsored was the largest category for people who earned this status in 2011. Employment-based preferences accounted for 13.1 percent.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security provides a breakdown for people receiving the employment-based preferences. ""Professionals with advanced degrees"" accounted for 6.3 percent. Another category combined ""skilled workers, professionals and unskilled workers,"" and that accounted for 3.5 percent. (The combined category makes it difficult to pluck out a number for only ""skilled"" workers.) The 2011 Yearbook of immigrant statistics shows that within those employment categories, the numbers reflect not just workers, but their spouses and children.

Our ruling

In an interview on reforming our immigration system, Rubio said ""I'm a big believer in family based immigration. But I don't think that in the 21st century we can continue to have an immigration system where only 6.5 percent of people who come here, come here based on labor and skill. We have to move toward merit and skill-based immigration.""

Rubio pulled his number from a 2011 Brookings paper that said, ""Some 36 percent of all Canadian immigrant visas are in the ‘skilled-worker’ category, as opposed to only 6.5 percent in the United States.""

Immigration data shows that most people come here for family reasons. The number of legal immigrants who come based on an employment varies depending on the type of visa and category of employment. But one valid example is to look at legal permanent residents -- 13.1 percent were employment-based preferences in 2011, and professionals with advanced degrees accounted for 6.3 percent.

In Wisconsin fight over election-day voter registration, group claims 6,200 cases of fraud in Minnesota
","
In the debate over making it easy for people to vote vs. making it hard to commit voter fraud, talk of eliminating Wisconsin’s same-day registration has become the new focal point.

Republican lawmakers, expressing concern about fraud, have said they would introduce a bill to end election-day voter registration -- a procedure Democrats defend as a way to maximize voter turnout.

Republican Gov. Scott Walker has said he wouldn’t sign such a bill. Nevertheless, the issue has not gone away.

The Wisconsin Club for Growth stoked the debate in its newsletter on Dec. 12, 2012.

The group alleged that in the November 2008 election in Minnesota, more than 6,200 election-day voter registrations were ""fraudulent.""

Minnesota’s same-day registration, which allow residents to register to vote moments before casting a ballot, is similar to Wisconsin’s. The two states are among eight, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, that allow same-day registration. (Same-day registration is to begin in a ninth, Connecticut, in July 2013.)

Claim fleshed out

Here’s a closer look at the Club for Growth claim.

""In Minnesota, well over 6,200 election-day registrations from 2008 proved fraudulent,"" the group charged in its newsletter. ""Post-election efforts to verify names and addresses revealed one or both to be fictitious in that many cases.

""Remember, 2008 was the election that made ‘Saturday Night Live’ clown Al Franken Minnesota’s junior (U.S.) senator, furnishing the crucial 60th vote for the monstrosity of ‘Obamacare.’ Franken’s winning margin? 312 votes.""

In Wisconsin in 2012, the newsletter continued, ""same-day registration chaos prevailed at polling places in the June recall that narrowly deposed Republican state Sen. Van Wanggaard. The November presidential election saw 57,000 polling-place registrations in Milwaukee alone.""

In Wisconsin, election-day registration began in 1976, according to the state Government Accountability Board, which oversees elections. Like Minnesota, residents can use one of roughly a dozen proof-of-residence documents, ranging from a driver’s license to a residential lease to a recent utility bill to a paycheck. In fall general elections, roughly 10 percent to 15 percent of voters who cast ballots register on election day.

Minnesota voting

Asked for evidence to back its claim, Club for Growth Wisconsin pointed to an opinion article by Republican state Rep. Mary Kiffmeyer that was published in a Stillwater, Minn., newspaper in October 2012. Kiffmeyer served as Minnesota secretary of state from 1999 through 2006, heading the office that oversees elections there.

In the 2008 presidential election, Kiffmeyer declared, ""we have more than 6,200 ballots out of 23,000 cast by voters who still cannot be found.""

But while Kiffmeyer raised concerns about election integrity in her article, she did not state that the 6,200 ballots were fraudulent.

That figure was generated nine months earlier, in a January 2012 report by Minnesota Majority. The group describes itself as a state watchdog that promotes ""traditional values"" such as ""limited government, lower taxes, parental rights, free markets, protecting our borders and a strong national defense.""

The report contends there were 6,224 ""unverifiable voters"" in the November 2008 election and that Minnesota’s system ""provides a window for fraudulent voting by use of false identities and/or addresses.""

Let’s take a look at how the Club for Growth went  beyond the ""unverifiable voters"" phrase and turned it into ""fraud.""

Minnesota Majority said that when local election officials mailed verification postcards to voters who did same-day registration for the November 2008 election, 6,224 were returned as undeliverable ""without a valid explanation,"" such as the voter changing residences after the election.

(The same sort of verification is also done in Wisconsin.)

The group also said its volunteers found in ""many"" cases that addresses listed by same-day registration voters did not exist or were not in residential areas.

""While not all returned postal verification cards are the result of fraudulent registrations, the large number of unexplained PVC returns is alarming,"" Minnesota Majority said in its report, noting the 312-vote Senate win by Franken. ""Even if only a fraction of these returned cards were the result of fraudulent registrations, the numbers could be significant enough to affect the outcome of several elections.""

But Minnesota Majority overstates the number of same-day registrants who couldn’t be verified, according to the Minnesota secretary of state.

Patricia Turgeon, spokeswoman for the office, said only 2,873 same-day registrations were flagged because of address problems.

Turgeon said most of the 2,873 postcards likely were returned to local election officials because the voters moved sometime between the election and when the verification cards were mailed. She said there were also other reasons postcards couldn't be delivered, including: data-entry errors by local election officials; the voter's handwriting on the registration form was illegible; or voters were living somewhere where they cannot receive mail, such as in a battered women's shelter or on the street.

As for actual cases of fraud, another secretary of state official, Beth Fraser, said there were about 140 convictions for election fraud in the November 2008 election.

The vast majority of those voters were ineligible because of felony convictions. She said the state was not aware of a single fraud conviction from that election that was due to a voter providing a false name or address.

Our rating

Arguing for an end to election-day voter registration in Wisconsin, Wisconsin Club for Growth claimed that in the November 2008 election, more than 6,200 election-day voter registrations in Minnesota were ""fraudulent.""

According to the Minnesota secretary of state’s office, the number of verification postcards that were returned is far overstated. What’s more, that alone is not proof of fraud. While it’s possible that some of those voters provided fraudulent information about their names or addresses, there is no evidence of more than 6,200 fraudulent same-day registrations.

"['Ohio', 'Congress', 'Health Care', 'Chain email']","
Did members of Congress exempt themselves from complying with the health care reform laws?
","
A new poll released this month by the firm Public Policy Polling showed Congress to be less popular than colonoscopies, root canals or cockroaches.

To get a lower favorability rating than Congress, the Washington newspaper The Hill reported, they had to be compared to lobbyists, playground bullies, telemarketers and the Kardashians.

Maybe that explains why people keep forwarding a viral email making damaging claims about Congress.

Our friends at Snopes.com, the urban legend checker, say the email has been circulating in various forms since at least 2000. But it’s still circulating. A reader who recently received a version of the email forwarded it to PolitiFact Ohio asking about its accuracy.

It asserts that relatives of members of Congress and Congressional staffers ""are exempt from having to pay back student loans"" -- a ridiculously false claim that Snopes.com and our colleagues at FactCheck.org debunked and that we rated Pants on Fire.

We also rated as Pants on Fire its claim that members of Congress can ""retire with the same pay after only one term.""

But readers also asked about another claim in the email: that members of Congress ""specifically exempted themselves from many of the laws they have passed, such as being exempt from any fear of prosecution for sexual harassment, while ordinary citizens must live under those laws. The latest is to exempt themselves from the healthcare reform, in all of its forms.""

PolitiFact first examined the claim that members of Congress are exempt from the provisions of the Affordable Care Act in 2009, when the legislation was still under consideration in Congress. 
We rated it False. That claim was based on the assumption that the health care reform plan would have sent everyone -- except Congress -- into a new ""public option"" federal insurance plan. It would not have.

In fact, the law as passed did not even include a public option -- and Section 1213 of it requires members of Congress and congressional staff, starting in 2014, to buy health plans created by the health care act or offered through the state exchanges the act establishes.

Political scientist Norman Ornstein, a long-time observer of Congress and a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, debunked the claim of congressional exemption in a piece he wrote for the Washington newspaper Roll Call.

""On the assertion that Members of Congress are exempt from the provisions of the Affordable Care Act: also false,"" he wrote. ""Members of Congress are subject under the health care reform law to the same mandate that others are to purchase insurance, and their plans must have the same minimum standards of benefits that other insurance plans will have to meet. Members of Congress currently have not a gold-plated free plan but the same insurance options that most other federal employees have, and they do not have it provided for free. They have a generous subsidy for their premiums, but no more generous (and compared to many businesses or professions less generous) than standard employer-provided subsidies throughout the country.""

FactCheck.org examined the broader claim that members of Congress ""specifically exempted themselves from many of the laws they have passed (such as being exempt from any fear of prosecution for sexual harassment),"" and found it ""15 years out of date"" in 2010.

The reason: Passage of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. It specifically made sure a variety of laws dealing with civil rights, labor and workplace safety regulations applied to the legislative branch of government. The independent Office of Compliance was set up to enforce the laws in Congress.

The act specifically prohibits harassment based on sex, race, color, religion, national origin, age and disability.

Ornstein, who has been sharply critical of Congress (and only last month co-authored a piece for Foreign Policy magazine titled ""Yes, Congress Is That Bad"") said it is ""not surprising that, in tough times, Americans would be inclined to believe the absolute worst about their elected officials.

""But at least,"" he added, ""let the criticism be fair and based on facts instead of persistent urban legends.""

PolitiFact Ohio would agree.

At best, the chain email's statement about Congressional exemptions is ridiculously out of date. At worst, it is cynically inaccurate.

Gingrey defense of Akin's rape comments misses the mark
","
So you might have heard that U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey of Marietta got himself into some trouble last week when he talked about rape.

Gingrey, now in his sixth term in the House, said fellow Republican Todd Akin of Missouri was ""partly right"" when Akin said last year that a woman’s body has a way of shutting down if she’s raped to prevent pregnancy. PolitiFact Georgia wanted to see whether there was any accuracy to Gingrey’s remarks.

""[I]n a situation of rape, a legitimate rape, a woman’s body has a way of shutting down so the pregnancy would not occur,"" Gingrey said during a question-and-answer segment at a meeting Thursday of the Smyrna Area Council of the Cobb Chamber of Commerce. ""[Akin’s] partly right on that.""

Gingrey, an obstetrician/gynecologist who said he’s delivered more than 5,200 babies, explained some more.

""And I’ve delivered lots of babies, and I know about these things. It is true. We tell infertile couples all the time that are having trouble conceiving because of the woman not ovulating, ‘Just relax. Drink a glass of wine. And don’t be so tense and uptight because all that adrenaline can cause you not to ovulate.’ So he was partially right, wasn’t he? But the fact that a woman may have already ovulated 12 hours before she is raped, you’re not going to prevent a pregnancy there by a woman’s body shutting anything down because the horse has already left the barn, so to speak. And yet the media took that and tore it apart."" 
Akin later apologized for his remarks and said rape can lead to pregnancy. His initial comments were largely cited as the reason Akin lost his campaign for a U.S. Senate seat. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who feared Akin’s comments would hurt him with women voters, gave Akin a verbal stiff arm. Gingrey said Akin’s remarks weren’t helpful. 
Gingrey’s effort to clarify what Akin said, first reported in The Marietta Daily Journal in its Friday editions, made the rounds within hours on several national political websites. The Democratic Party leader in Gingrey’s district has already announced plans to challenge the incumbent next year. On Monday, Gingrey’s Twitter site, deluged with criticism of Gingrey’s remarks, had been removed.

Gingrey sent The Atlanta Journal-Constitution a statement Friday.

""I do not defend, nor do I stand by, the remarks made by Rep. Akin. … In my attempt to provide context as to what I presumed they meant, my position was misconstrued,"" Gingrey said.

Gingrey’s office did not respond to our messages for further comment.

Some doctors and organizations said there is no accuracy to the Georgia congressman’s claims.

""While chronic severe stress and anxiety may impact fertility sometimes, the fact is that a woman cannot prevent ovulation or conception with their emotions, especially in an acute traumatic situation like rape,"" said Barbara Croft, a board-certified OB/GYN based in Atlanta who has been in practice for 30 years.

Croft called Gingrey’s comments patronizing, condescending and unscientific. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a Washington, D.C.-based organization with about 56,000 members, including Croft, echoed her comments.

""While chronic stress, for example from extreme exposure to famine or war, may decrease a woman’s ability to conceive, there is no scientific evidence that adrenaline, experienced in an acute stress situation, has an impact on ovulation,"" the group told us via email.

Gingrey is a fellow with the organization, which is defined as a board-certified OB/GYN whose professional activity is devoted to the practice of obstetrics and/or gynecology.

For decades, some politicians and newsmakers -- mostly social conservatives -- have said women who are raped are less likely to become pregnant. Their definition of a legitimate rape is a woman who is sexually assaulted. 
The Washington Post reported that National Right to Life President John Wilke wrote an essay in 1999 that the ""physical trauma"" of rape has a way of preventing pregnancy. The newspaper’s website has a link to the essay. The link contains an analysis of Akin’s remarks by the Rev. Robert Fleischmann, the national director of Christian Life Resources.

""Statistically speaking, it appears something happens in a rape, either with the victim or with the perpetrator, that reduces the incidence of pregnancy,"" Fleischmann wrote in August. ""Fertility specialists continually debate the role of emotions, unresolved conflicts and trauma play in female infertility."" 

There is some discussion on websites such as FertilityFactor.com that severe stress, eating disorders, excess exercise or extreme weight loss can interfere with regular menstruation.

Some studies widely reported by news outlets conclude that the rate of rape-related pregnancy is higher than the rate of pregnancy from consensual sex. The likelihood of a rape-related pregnancy is usually in the 5 percent range, the studies show. Most of these studies, though, were done in the 1980s or 1990s.

The Chicago Tribune, citing a Mayo Clinic publication about infertility, reported in August that mental stress can temporarily alter an area of the brain that controls the hormones that regulate a woman’s menstrual cycle. The Tribune article reported that it is a chronic kind of situation that occurs over months or years, not the acute trauma of a rape.

Our conclusion:

Gingrey said it’s ""partly right"" that a woman's body has a way of shutting down so that a pregnancy doesn't occur if she's raped. There is some information that suggests that some conditions, particularly stress, can reduce fertility. But our research found it is not typically the stress of a rape.

There’s scant scientific evidence to support Gingrey’s argument.

Providence City Council resolution claims semi-automatic weapons are designed for military use
","In the wake of the deadly school shootings in Newtown, Conn., the Providence City Council passed a resolution calling for ""a ban on the sale, use, and possession of all semi-automatic firearms within Providence.""

The Jan. 3 resolution, approved on a 8-6 vote with one abstention, begins with a preamble, outlining a variety of claims about gun violence to support a ban.

It opens with 14 ""Whereas"" statements, beginning with the definition of a semi-automatic firearm as ""a weapon that fires, extracts, ejects and reloads once for each pull and release of the trigger."" (By contrast, fully automatic weapons continue to fire as long as the trigger is being pulled.)

But it was the second statement which caught our attention. It says, ""Semi-automatic weapons, whether pistol or rifle, were designed for use by the military on the battlefield.""

There is no doubt that some of the semi-automatic weapons sold to consumers these days are either very close to those used by soldiers or designed to have the characteristics of military weapons. It's one of their selling points. For example, Bushmaster M4-type carbines are advertised as having a ""distinctive military barrel profile."" The company says its products are used ""by the military of more than 50 countries worldwide.""

But we also know that other weapons, such as many hunting rifles, meet the definition of semi-automatic. So we wondered whether it’s accurate to say that all semi-automatics were really designed for military use.

We contacted the City Council’s majority leader, Seth Yurdin,to see what evidence he had.

He wrote back in an e-mail that, ""Semi-automatic weapons as a class were designed for the battlefield. Why? Semi-automatic weapons are efficient at killing as many people as quickly as possible.""

After listing several different types of weapons used in mass shootings, Yurdin said, ""Yes, there may be particular semi-automatic weapons that have not been designed to win military bids, but the point is that semi-automatic weapons are designed to be efficient killing machines.""

We tried unsuccessfully to contact several manufacturers about the histories of their products, but they did not respond.

But four experts with whom we did speak said the statement in the City Council resolution is wrong because many semi-automatic weapons -- from the very first to those in use today -- were not designed for war.

William Fowler, distinguished professor of history at Northeastern University, in Boston, said semi-automatic weapons ""are not necessarily military. Shotguns, for example, can be gas operated,"" utilizing gas from the discharge of one round to push the next round into the chamber, ready for the trigger to be pulled again.

Going back to the beginning, the first design of a semi-automatic rifle was unveiled in 1885. American gunsmith John Moses Browning crafted the first semi-automatic shotgun in 1902. By 1910, Winchester, Remington and others were making semi-automatic sporting rifles.

When they were first manufactured, ""a lot of time the semis were intended for use by the general public,"" said Frank Hanner, director of the National Infantry Museum in Fort Benning, Ga. ""These were pocket pistols and different things, what we would consider to be a Saturday night special today. A lot of these were intended for protection on the street.""

""The semi-automatic system was NOT specifically developed for the military,"" said Richard Colton, a historian at the Springfield Armory in Massachusetts, who cited the semi-automatic pistols that came out in the 1890s, many of them made in Germany, that were supposed to be for personal use.

David Stieghan, U.S. Army Infantry branch historian at Ft. Benning, said, ""Semi-automatic weapons such as shotguns and .22 caliber hunting rifles had already been in existence for 40 years"" before the U.S. military became the first to adopt them.

""The initial push was to manufacture them for hunting, and home defense and self-defense, because very few in the military cared about them until after World War I,"" he said.

Why didn't the military embrace them earlier?

""They were difficult to machine and manufacture in a way that was inexpensive, and they were not amenable to use in the trenches of World War I,"" said Stieghan. ""With all the mud, dirt, water and everything else, they were just not reliable enough.""

And what about weapons for sale today?

Stieghan said the vast majority of semi-automatic firearms available to the public were never designed for -- nor offered for sale to -- the military.

""There are all sorts of semi-automatic weapons that are unacceptable [to the military] because they're not rugged enough and they don't have the long-range and accuracy that the military would require,"" he said. ""They are designed specifically for consumers.""

Our ruling

The Providence City Council, in a resolution approved earlier this month, asserted: ""Semi-automatic weapons, whether pistol or rifle, were designed for use by the military on the battlefield.""

The military and gun experts we consulted told us that history tells a very different story.

The military did not embrace the weapons until decades after they were developed.

Even today, there are many semi-automatic weapons available to consumers that were not designed for battlefield use.

Why bother with such distinctions? The contentious debate over gun control is consuming the nation. We believe it’s imperative to get the facts right.

We rate the ""statement of fact"" in the council's resolution False.

Don Gaetz says he backed proposal to expand early voting hours per day
","
Amid criticism of new Florida voting laws that were widely blamed for long lines at the polls, Florida Senate President Don Gaetz said he’s willing to revisit the rules during the upcoming legislative session.

Gaetz voted for the controversial 2011 law, which among other things cut the number of early voting days from 14 to eight.

Gaetz, a Niceville Republican, is not yet convinced the state needs to expand the number of early voting days, but he’s quick to point out that it is because of him that the state expanded daily early voting hours in the 2011 bill.

""I sponsored the amendment that expanded the hours of early voting so that people who have irregular work schedules could vote,"" Gaetz said in a Jan. 11, 2013, editorial board interview with the Orlando Sentinel. ""And I said if that amendment didn't pass, I would join the Democrats in resisting the proposal to limit the number of days of early voting.""

Let’s rewind the clock. Is Gaetz correctly characterizing the past?

First, a refresher: The sweeping elections overhaul pushed by Republicans included a number of new restrictions on voter registration, political committees, the date of the presidential preference primary and, yeah, early voting.

Before Gov. Rick Scott signed HB 1355 into law, early voting started 15 days ahead of an election and ended two days prior. Supervisors were required to provide voters with eight hours of early voting on weekdays sometime between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., as well as a total of eight hours during each of the two weekends. Voting on the Sunday before an election was popular among African-Americans who hosted ""souls to the polls"" drives.

All told, supervisors had to provide 96 hours for early voting.

The new law reduced the number of days for early voting from 14 to eight. Republicans said they thought the changes would save money, but Democrats accused them of trying to suppress the vote of liberal and minority voters, who prefer early voting. The new law also meant an end to the ""souls to the polls"" rallies on the Sunday before the election.

The new law came with new restrictions for voting hours, too. Instead of eight hours of early voting per weekday, the law called for a minimum of six hours a day and a maximum of 12 hours a day.

* * *
Now we’ll examine what Gaetz had to do with it.

Gaetz spokeswoman Katherine Betta directed us to this amendment introduced by Gaetz and the sponsor of the proposed elections overhaul, Sen. Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, R-Miami, on May 5, 2011.

The amendment did three main things: It required local election supervisors to tell the Department of State 30 days in advance the hours and address of each early voting site; it reduced the number of days for early voting, as we have already explained; and it set the daily number of hours for early voting between six and 12 hours. The latter action is key to our fact-check.

Gaetz said he introduced the amendment to give more consideration to teachers and military members who populate his former Panhandle district and may have unusual working hours. Voting days of 12 hours would mean voting would be available outside of the traditional 9-to-5 workday.

Senate Republicans said they thought reducing early voting days would save money, but a few elections supervisors warned that 12-hour days might actually lead to higher overtime costs. According to news accounts, Gaetz said Republicans did not want to ""dramatically reduce early voting.""

At one point during the legislative process, the number of early voting days was reduced all the way down to five. Republicans fended off Democratic attempts to restore the number of early voting days back to 14. Gaetz’s amendment, which offered eight early voting days, was adopted by the Senate and included in the final version of the bill that Scott signed.

* * *

Now we will address the claim that Gaetz offered the amendment as a compromise and threatened to join Democrats against the measure without it.

We checked with the Senate’s former minority leader, Nan Rich, D-Weston, who said she had not heard about that.

""I never recalled him saying he was going to stand with the Democrats,"" she said. ""All I know is how he voted."" 
We looked for comments Gaetz may have made on the Senate floor but didn't find any. In an interview, Gaetz said he did not remember exactly when and where he said he would side with the Democrats without the amendment. He ruled out saying it on the Senate floor or to members of the opposing party, though.

""I may have said it in committee, I said it to my staff and I said it to the president,"" Gaetz said, referring to his Senate president predecessor, Mike Haridopolos.

Some Republican leaders in the Senate wanted to cut the number of early voting days to eight without expanding hours to make up for lost time, said Diaz de la Portilla in an interview with us. He said he never witnessed Gaetz saying he would cross party lines over the early voting amendment, but ""I know there were conversations.""

PolitiFact Florida has previously disproved the claim that the number of hours are the same. Under the new law, local supervisors may do a maximum of 96 hours. But they may also offer fewer than that. 

Gaetz declined to tell us what kind of changes, if any, he wants to consider in the upcoming legislative session, though he said he could see allowing for more early voting locations. He wants to wait for the findings of a special committee on ethics and elections headed by Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, before calling for across-the-board changes for every county, he said.

""My attitude is that as we speak, Sen. (Jack) Latvala is conducting a hearing with election supervisors to try to find out what were the reasons that there were difficulties in some places,"" Gaetz told PolitiFact Florida.

Our ruling

Back to our mission: Gaetz’s editorial board comments that he sponsored the amendment that expanded hours for early voting and threatened to join Democrats in opposition if leaders did not agree to it.

We cannot prove or disprove his claim that he threatened to side with Democrats. For this reason, we’re not rating this part of his statement.

Gaetz did introduced the amendment that permitted more hours for early voting. But his amendment empowered supervisors to provide up to 12 hours of early voting a day. It was not an automatic expansion, and supervisors could actually choose to offer less time than the old law.

Kirk Watson says in “our region,” 2011 was worst drought year on record
","
Two state senators urged the Lower Colorado River Authority to dispense water carefully in an opinion piece in the Austin American-Statesman on Dec. 31, 2012.

""Our region is facing an emergency situation with the ongoing and ever-worsening drought: 2011 was the most severe year of drought ever recorded,"" wrote Sens. Kirk Watson and Troy Fraser.

Statewide, 2011 was a record year -- specifically ""the worst single-year drought on record,"" according to a March 23, 2012, Statesman news story.

In a Dec. 31, 2011, wrapup of the year’s biggest local news stories, Statesman editors put the drought at No. 2:
  
Crops wilted, lake levels dropped, lawns turned brown, and wildlife went thirsty as Texas endured record drought. At one point in October, 88 percent of the state was deemed to be in exceptional drought, the most severe level. Austin received just less than 15 inches of rain, about half of its normal precipitation, and sweated through a record 90 days of triple-digit temperatures."" 

So not all areas suffered to the same degree. Was the drought as harsh here as elsewhere?

First, we checked to make sure what region the senators meant. Watson spokesman Steve Scheibal told us by email that it would be fair to say they meant counties in the river authority's jurisdiction in and around the Austin area (Watson’s District 14 takes in Bastrop County and most of Travis County) and upriver in Fraser’s District 24.

We figured that’s probably about the impression Statesman readers got from the words ""our region,"" given that the context was senators discussing the river authority.

So we based our fact-finding on Travis, Williamson, Hays and Bastrop counties around Austin, plus Burnet, Blanco, Lampasas, Gillespie, Llano, San Saba and Brown counties upstream.

  
We looked at 11 counties. Click to view larger map 


Scheibal sent us links to 2011-12 newsletters and reports from the river authority and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality that described record-setting drought across Texas and dry months in the Lower Colorado river basin.

To get a closer look, we spoke via phone and email with state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon, an atmospheric science professor at Texas A&M University.

Drought, he told us, can be defined by factors including lack of rainfall, length of time and impact on people and crops.

Factoring in duration, for example, the most severe Texas drought remains the 1950-1957 drought, which an Aug. 14, 2011, Statesman news story said ""reshaped Texas, ruining thousands of farmers and ranchers and pushing rural residents to migrate out of the country and into the cities."" That was the worst extended drought since reliable state records began in the 1890s, though a 2011 study of Texas cypress tree rings showed several longer, harsher droughts over the past 500 years.

To help us judge the ""most severe year of drought"" in the 11-county region, Nielsen-Gammon checked rainfall data recorded there for each ""water year"" back to 1893.

Water years run from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30, he said, beginning with the period when most rainfall accumulates and ending after peak water use. The key is ""how much water you end up with at the end of the summer,"" he said.

In rainfall, Nielsen-Gammon told us, 2011 was the second-worst ""water year"" (Oct. 1 to Sept. 30) in those 11 counties since 1893.

The lowest rainfall came in 1956. But the drought was more severe in 2011, he said, because summer temperatures averaged 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit above those of 1956, ""increasing the need for water by plants while simultaneously evaporating water from reservoirs.""

So, according to Nielsen-Gammon, the 2011 water year was the worst 12-month drought ever recorded in the 11-county region. The 2011 calendar year would also have been the worst recorded, he said, measured by the river authority’s records of water flowing into the Highland Lakes: Buchanan, Inks, LBJ, Marble Falls, Travis and Austin, of which lakes Buchanan and Travis are reservoirs supplying water customers.

According to a Jan. 8, 2013, river authority report sent us by Scheibal, 2011 saw the lowest-ever recorded water flow (from creeks and other tributaries) into the Highland Lakes. We confirmed that with river authority spokeswoman Clara Tuma, who told us its records began in 1942, after the construction of Mansfield Dam created Lake Travis.

Nielsen-Gammon told us that although it would take ""some sort of major rain"" to get the river authority’s water levels back up to normal, the rainfall picture for 2012 was better overall, with precipitation near or above normal levels. Forecasts for 2013 are a still a toss-up, both he and Tuma said. The river authority posted an update Jan. 9, 2012, with data and an interactive map from the National Drought Mitigation Service showing the region still in ""Severe Drought.""

Our ruling

Watson said 2011 was the worst drought year in ""our region."" In records dating to 1893 for the general area indicated, 2011 was the most severe single-year drought by rainfall combined with evaporation, and it also saw the lowest recorded water-flow into the Highland Lakes.

Claim spending rose under fiscal cliff deal misses half the story
","
As the nation gears up for more debates on the budget, we here at PolitiFact Georgia figure we’d better sort out what happened during the last one.

Thanks to the fiscal cliff deal passed by Congress on New Year’s Day, a series of automatic spending cuts and tax hikes designed to pressure legislators into acting on the federal budget won’t go into effect until March.

Lawmakers may have agreed to pass the the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, but they don’t agree on what it did.

Some supporters said the deal cut spending. But U.S. Rep. Tom Price, a Roswell Republican, begged to differ.

""My assessment was that it ultimately raised taxes and didn’t decrease any spending. In fact, it increased spending,"" Price said during a Jan. 2 interview on WMAL-FM, a Washington-area radio station. He voted against the deal.

So which one is it? A spending increase or cut?

A prior PolitiFact check addressed Price’s claim on taxes and found it was Half True. It’s valid to see the deal as a tax cut or an increase.

Thanks to the deal, our taxes are lower than if Congress allowed the nation to fall off the fiscal cliff and stay there. But we’re paying more taxes than we did in 2012.   

So, we wondered, is the deal’s impact on spending a matter of perspective as well?

For the most part, yes.    

Compared with what would have happened without a deal, it’s a spending increase.

As we mentioned before, the old statute required automatic spending cuts on Jan. 1. If this law stayed in place, outlays would have totaled nearly $47. 4 trillion over 10 years, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which measures the impact of legislation on the budget.

Passage of the deal pushed the CBO’s estimate to more than $47.7 trillion, a spending boost of about $330 billion.  

But compared with what the federal government spent in 2012, the deal is a cut, CBO figures show.

The agency calculated spending changes based on an ""alternative fiscal scenario"" in which 2013 outlays would have stayed roughly the same as they were in 2012.

Using this baseline, spending would have topped $50 trillion through 2022. Spending under the deal is about $2.3 trillion lower.

Now here’s where things get complicated. Even when analysts use the same baseline, estimates on the deal’s spending impact can vary by tens of billions of dollars.

Consider estimates by the conservative Heritage Foundation and the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

They compared spending under the fiscal cliff deal with the former law.
As we said above, the fiscal cliff deal is a spending increase if you use this baseline.  

The Heritage Foundation found that the deal increased spending by $47 billion over 10 years. This is proof that Congress has not gotten serious about cutting the budget, said Patrick Louis Knudsen, a senior fellow in federal budgetary affairs at the think tank.

""As dollar amounts go, it’s not a very large amount,"" Knudsen said. ""But as a matter of principle it is.""

On the other hand, the CBPP estimates that the increase is closer to $3 billion over 10 years. The group concluded it was not a significant increase.

Analyses differ because they tally certain spending line items differently. But in the world of trillion-dollar federal budgets, this $44 billion gap is not a major one.  

""With so much money being spent, whether spending goes up by $3 billion or $47 billion is a rounding error,"" said Howard Gleckman, an Urban Institute budget expert. ""We will never know who is right. I just say the deal barely changed spending from CBO's projections.""

One last thing. As we mentioned in our prior fact check on the tax portion of Price’s claim, the trick is to make sure you don’t mix up your baselines.

If your analysis compares current spending with expenditures in 2012, use the same baseline for taxes as well, experts told us.

Price runs into trouble on this front. His conclusion that taxes rose is valid compared with the amount paid in 2012. But from this perspective, spending is actually down.

Once again, we come to the conclusion that Price is both right and wrong.

If Congress had failed to change the law in 2012 that sent the country off the fiscal cliff, federal spending would be lower than it is now.

But if spending had stayed at 2012 levels, it would be higher.    

Price’s claim on spending is technically accurate. But he leaves out critical  information. And he mixes his budget baselines to make a point. In our book, that’s a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097479F00>],/factchecks/2013/jan/15/tom-price/claim-spending-rose-under-fiscal-cliff-deal-misses/

NRCC compares the nation's debt to all the word's platinum, takes aim at trillion dollar coin
","
According to the National Republican Congressional Committee, President Barack Obama, U.S. Rep. Ann McLane Kuster and other Washington Democrats have a platinum target on their backs.

That's because some economists and legal scholars say Obama -- and, by extension,other Washington Democrats could solve the nation’s debt limit problem by taking advantage of an obscure law to mint platinum coins, which Obama could use to offset the debt and avoid a standoff with House Republicans over spending cuts. Under this theory, as little as an ounce of platinum could be used to mint a coin with a denomination of $1 trillion.

Neither the White House, nor Kuster, the target of a recent attack by the GOP congressional group, have commented on the matter. But, according to the Republican campaign committee, not even all the platinum in all the world could solve America’s spending problems.

""Heard of that trillion-dollar platinum coin Democrats want?"" the congressional committee said in a press release issued Wednesday, January 9.

""Well, even if you took literally every single ounce of platinum in the world, it still wouldn’t add up to enough needed to pay down our nation’s debt,"" the release stated.""Yet President Obama and Washington Democrats like Ann McLane Kuster continue to support policies that bankrupt our country.""

The NRCC's point is a bit silly because that's not what economists are proposing. But just for fun -- and a chance to leaf through the pages of ""A History of Platinum"" -- we decided to check it out.

To be clear: We are not making a Truth-O-Meter ruling on whether Obama can do it or whether the strategy would succeed. We are simply addressing the NRCC's comparison of the total amount of platinum to the federal debt.

Is the NRCC right? We decided to check the scales.

First, let’s get a few calculations out of the way.

As of January 9, the date of the NRCC statement, the national debt stood at $16.432 trillion, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.

That same day, the price of platinum was listed at $1,583 per troy ounce, according to Platinum Today, a website (Troy ounces are the unit of measurement used to measure precious metals).

By those numbers, it would take approximately 10.38 billion troy ounces of platinum to pay off the debt.
So, has the world produced that much platinum? We decided to check the records.

According to the Platinum Metals Review, a publication by Johnson Matthey PLC, a London-based precious metals company, 130,715 million troy ounces were supplied between 1975, the first formal records available, and 2006. And more recently, mines supplied 36.935 million ounces from 2007-2012, company records show.

That brings the total of platinum mined since 1975 to 167.65 million ounces -- less than 1/60th of the 10.38 billion needed to pay off the debt.

Numbers prior to 1975 are harder to track. Johnson Matthey, the industry group,  didn’t keep formal records on platinum production before that time. Thankfully, historians Donald McDonald and Leslie B. Hunt offered some thoughts on the matter in their book, ""A History of Platinum.""

According to the book, referenced on the Johnson Matthey website, two countries -- Columbia and Russia -- supplied most of the world’s platinum through most of the 19th Century. But, in 1888, explorers discovered platinum deposits in the ore mines of in Ontario, Canada.

Between 1902-1919, companies mined about 33,000 ounces of platinum from the mines. And by 1929, that number increased to about 300,000 ounces per year of platinum, along with the five other metals known as the Platinum Group Metals.

Elsewhere in the world, explorers discovered the Merensky Reef in South Africa in 1924, and over the years it became the world’s largest source of platinum. By 1938, the amount produced from the Merensky Reef reached 25,000 ounces per year, and by 1955, that number reached 200,000 per year, and in 1973, it exceeded 1 million ounces, according to the Platinum Metals Review.

This steady increase in production makes the numbers difficult to track. But, for argument’s sake, let’s use some very generous numbers and say all the mines across the globe combined to supply 1 million ounces of platinum each year back to 1902 -- far more than most estimates.

That would add 72 million ounces to the total 167.65 million tracked between 1975-2012, and the total production dating back to 1902 would then reach 239.65 million troy ounces.

That total, priced at the $1,583 per ounce, the Jan. 9 rate, would equal about $379.365 billion in value -- still less than 1/40th of the $16 trillion debt figure. Even doubling the 167.65 million figure from 1975-2012 (335.3 million ounces) would leave the total value of platinum at $530.779 billion -- still less than 1/30th of the debt. And pricing that 335.3 million ounces total by $2,280, the market’s 20-year high from March 2008, the total ($764.484 billion) would still fall more than $15 trillion short.

Our ruling:

There are no formal counts of platinum production dating back before 1975, but based on recent records and historical accounts, there is no evidence to suggest the value of the world’s total platinum supply comes within reach of the national debt.

Records from Johnson Matthey PLC, an industry leader, show that 167.65 million troy ounces were supplied between 1975-2012, and historical records indicate that number far exceeds the amount mined in the years prior.

Even by the most generous counts, the total value of the the world’s platinum supply is only a fraction of the national debt.

Vince Megna says Gov. Scott Walker destroyed 200 consumer laws with Act 92
","
Vince Megna, the Milwaukee attorney known as ""King of the Lemon Laws,"" is mincing no words as he runs a partisan-style race attempting to unseat Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Patience Roggensack.

In a profanity-laced, theatrical series of YouTube videos and on his campaign website, the man who built a national reputation taking on auto companies and other big corporations goes after Gov. Scott Walker and other Republicans.

Megna is running in the spring 2013 race as a liberal Democrat even though the contest is officially nonpartisan. He considers Roggensack a Republican, a claim we won’t deal with here.

One of Megna’s big talking points is the measure by GOP lawmakers in 2011 -- in what became Act 92-- that limited attorney fees in the kind of cases that are Megna’s bread and butter.

""Governor Scott Walker signed into law the most destructive anti-consumer protection bill in Wisconsin history,"" Megna’s website says. ""With one swipe of the pen, 200 consumer laws were destroyed and more than 40 years of case law development was rendered moot.""

We’re not going to compare the measure with every consumer bill since statehood.

But we will test whether ""200 consumer laws were destroyed"" by it.

A bit of background first.

Rep. Robin Vos, R-Rochester, who is now the Assembly speaker, shepherded through the 2011 bill after a car dealer in his district fought a lawsuit by a man who said the dealership did about $5,000 of unauthorized work on his new truck.

Megna was an attorney for the truck owner. A Racine County judge ruled in the dealer’s favor. But the state Court of Appeals ruled the truck owner didn’t have to pay if he didn’t authorize the work.It sent the case back to the lower court.

Three days before subsequent trial at the lower court, the two sides settled, with the dealer paying $12,500 for damages and interest, $151,250 in legal fees and $5,284 in costs.

The Vos-backed bill said judges should presume that reasonable attorneys fees do not exceed three times the amount of compensatory damages. But judges can lift the cap under certain circumstances.

Over the objections of Democrats and consumer advocates, the law took effect in December 2011, so it’s slightly more than a year old.

When we asked Megna how the measure ""destroyed 200 consumer laws,"" he backed off a bit, saying he did not mean it in a literal sense.

Indeed, in 2011, he told reporters the effect would be to ""virtually repeal"" the statutes.

He repeated that to PolitiFact Wisconsin, saying that Walker’s action amounts towiping out the statutes because lawyers will be wary of representing tenants, discrimination victims and buyers of defective cars given the possible fee limits.

""Those are effectively wiped out because you can’t find attorneys who will represent you,"" he said.

Let’s take a look under the hood.

The law clearly can affect lawyer’s fees in many matters brought under so-called ""fee-shifting"" cases -- matters in which laws give consumers the right to recover attorney’s fees from the other side if they prevail.

As many as 280 statutory and administrative causes of action could fall under the three-times-damages cap, according to an October 2012 analysis in the Wisconsin Lawyer, a publication of the State Bar of Wisconsin. The Bar opposed the legislation, saying it would also hurt businesses’ legal defense against frivolous claims brought by someone who has actually violated the law.

Many of those 200-plus statutes are related to consumer protection; some are not.

But did the legislation ""destroy"" them?

We contacted consumer lawyers and those who defend businesses and found general agreement that the law will spawn changes, some potentially significant -- and in the eyes of lawyers for consumers, harmful to their cause because they believe getting a lawyer will be more difficult.

But none went so far as to say consumer laws that allow legal action had been destroyed or eliminated.

Attorney David Dudley represented many low-income clients from an office in Madison and relied exclusively on attorney-fee-shift provisions for its operation. He closed the office after the law took effect, blaming the legislation for the move. He now works for the federal government.

DeVonna Joy, a southeast-Wisconsin consumer lawyer, told us she now turns down more potential clients. Proving even small claims cases can cost a lot, the cap is ""absurdly low"" in many cases, and defense lawyers are dragging out more cases to pressure plaintiffs to settle, she said.

Joy acknowledged that other lawyers might be picking up some of the clients she’s rejected, but she said many already have been turned down multiple times when she hears from them.

Brian Schuk, a Delavan attorney who represents tenants and sometimes landlords, says he now refuses many smaller cases even when there is an obvious violation of the law. So now, more of those people don’t end up suing, or try to take on landlords without representation, he said.

At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, two professors active in public-interest law, Sarah Orr and Mitch, said it was too early to judge the ultimate impact, but both said fewer cases would be brought on behalf of consumers and tenants in matters such as fraud, debt collection and consumer-law violations. Note: Mitch officially has no last name.

But not all lawyers are trimming their caseloads -- including Megna himself.

Megna told us that his own practice is mainly intact because he handles some big-ticket cases that allow him to continue to handle smaller cases.

We also spoke with lawyers who often find themselves defending clients against consumer claims.

Tristan Pettit, a Milwaukee lawyer who frequently represents residential landlords and businesses, said he has not seen much effect one way or another.

Lisa Lawless, another Milwaukee lawyer, said the law’s impact is still an open question, but predicted that lawyers representing consumers would be more ""reasonable"" about settling cases faster. She praised the law, and said the fee cap was fair, but added that it could be an issue for lawyers taking on small damage claims.

Both say they have not noticed a drop-off in cases.

Finally, it’s worth noting again that the new law presumes a cap at three times damages, but a judge can go higher.

Megna acknowledged that it’s too early to say whether judges will allow fees above the suggested cap. Many cases in front of judges now were filed before the law went into effect and thus not covered by the limits.

But many lawyers who handle cases affected by the law predict the cap will become the standard -- in part because busy judges can’t take the time to sort out what is reasonable on fees.

Our rating

Megna described the impact of Act 92 in stark and dramatic terms saying that ""200 consumer laws were destroyed"" when Walker signed it.

It seems clear that the changes tilt the playing field against consumers in some significant ways, but the laws remain on the books and litigation will continue at some level -- perhaps reduced, but it’s premature to say.

Megna’s claim misleadingly suggests Walker and Republican legislators wiped hundreds of statutes off the books.

We rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097059080>],/factchecks/2013/jan/14/vince-megna/vince-megna-says-gov-scott-walker-destroyed-200-co/

Jim Jordan says seven of the nation's 10 wealthiest counties are in the Greater Washington area
","
Conservative Ohio Republican Jim Jordan has long preached the need to get government spending under control. In 2011, the congressman from Champaign County voted against raising the nation’s debt ceiling, and he recently opposed a compromise to keep the nation from plunging off a ""fiscal cliff"" because he felt it delayed needed spending cuts.

On Jan. 6, Jordan brought his critique of out-of-control government spending to Fox News Sunday, where he compared the federal government to an 18-year-old with a maxed out credit card and argued that Washington was the only winner in the ""fiscal cliff deal,"" while his constituents in Ohio lost money.
 
""Washington always wins,"" said Jordan, whose congressional district was recently altered to include parts of Lorain County ""The politicians, the consultants, the folks here always win. In fact, seven of the 10 wealthiest counties are in the D.C. area.  . . .  It's regular Americans who lose and it's about time we said stop this madness, cut up the credit card, we want a solution. Not another Washington deal which helps D.C.""

PolitiFact Ohio thought Jordan’s point about the relative wealth of the counties around Washington, D.C. was worth exploring.

It didn’t take long to find the statistics behind his assertion. An article in The Washington Post  last September that examined 2011 Census data verified Jordan’s claim that seven of the 10 counties in the nation with the highest household incomes are in the Greater Washington region.  

Loudoun, Fairfax and Arlington counties in Virginia held the top three spots with respective median household incomes of $119,134, $105,797 and $100,735. Howard County, Maryland, ($98,953) ranked fifth. Prince WIlliam County in Virginia ($95,146) ranked seventh. Fauquier County, Virginia ($93,762) was eighth. Montgomery County in Maryland ($92,909) placed 10th.

That’s seven of the top 10. And just for good measure, nearby Charles County in Maryland ranked 11th with a median household income of $91,733.

The District of Columbia itself, which the Census Bureau compared to both states and counties, had a median income of around $63,000, which would have been 125th among counties and fifth among states.

Just two counties in Jordan’s home state ranked among the nation’s 100 most affluent for 2011. Delaware County, north of Columbus, ranked 18th with an income of $85,365. Warren County northeast of Cincinnati ranked 80th at $69,201. Neither, by the way, is in his House district.

According to Census Bureau estimates, Ohio’s $45,749 median household income put the state in the bottom third, well below the national average of $50,502. Maryland ranked No. 1 in 2011, with a median income of $70,004. Virginia ($61,882 ) ranked ninth. Mississippi had the nation’s lowest median household income: $36,919.

The Washington Post attributed the region’s relative opulence to ""the stability of an economy built on the pillars of the federal government, its legions of contractors and a flourishing high-tech sector."" It noted that the Washington metropolitan area has the nation’s highest level of adults with college degrees, that a high proportion of its households have two wage earners and that many of its married couples put off childbearing until they’re professionally established.

The Post said that in 2007, before the recession began, five counties in suburban Washington made it into the top 10. By 2010, there were six. The seven in the latest ranking are ""all-time high,"" it said.

""It’s not only that we have low unemployment and a lot of dual-income households,"" Stephen Fuller, director of the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University told the Post. ""We lost a few government jobs, but not the high-paying, professional business-service jobs that are still growing, if not as fast as they used to. Since the rest of the country is in such poor shape, we just have to show a little bit of growth here, and we look pretty good.""

Jordan’s claim that the Washington area contains seven of the 10 wealthiest counties in the nation checks out.
