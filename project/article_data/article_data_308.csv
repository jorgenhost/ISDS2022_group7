Mitt Romney says achievement gap in Massachusetts improved on his watch
","
Mitt Romney heard both cheers and boos during his speech to the 2012 NAACP convention, where he vowed to ""help hundreds of millions of middle-class Americans of all races.""

While acknowledging the unlikelihood of a Republican addressing the group in the midst of a race against an African-American president, Romney nonetheless declared that he is the best candidate to help black Americans.

The former Massachusetts governor touted his own record on several topics, including education. He said he intervened in failing schools, promoted math and science and strengthened testing standards.

""When I was governor, not only did test scores improve – we also narrowed the achievement gap,"" Romney, who served from 2003 to 2007, said.

Romney’s education record in Massachusetts is uncharted territory at PolitiFact, so we decided to check it out.

A little on Massachusetts schools

We talked to several people knowledgeable about the school system in the Bay State, and all mentioned a 1993 landmark reform law that included the groundwork for the state accountability system (later called Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, or MCAS), authorized charter schools and invested more money in local school districts. Its universal goal was to raise educational standards for all Massachusetts kids.

Romney also referenced the reform in his speech to the NAACP on July 11, 2012:

""In the years before I took office our state’s leaders had come together to pass bipartisan measures that were making a difference. In reading and in math, our students were already among the best in the nation – and during my term, they took over the top spot.  

""Those results revealed what good teachers can do if the system will only let them. The problem was, this success wasn’t shared. A significant achievement gap between students of different races remained. So we set out to close it.""

This was all happening in a place where student achievement regularly leads the pack. Massachusetts, which has a disproportionately high number of colleges and universities, some of the nation’s wealthiest ZIP codes and a well-educated workforce, churns out many high performing students.

But the glare of those top achievers makes the shadow of struggling students that much darker. That is to say, Massachusetts still has a significant achievement gap. The term refers to the disparity in performance between certain subsets of students. White, middle- and upper-class kids consistently do better in school than African-American and latino and low-income kids in the U.S.

And in Massachusetts, because the kids at the top do so well, it’s that much harder for everybody else to catch up.

""Our scores are high, so as they get higher it’s pretty hard to move up,"" said Kathleen Skinner, a policy director at the Massachusetts Teachers Association, a teachers union.

Narrowing the gap

As backup for the claim in Romney’s speech, his campaign sent us a 2007 MCAS test results summary, and specifically pointed to 10th grade scores:

10th Grade Proficiency In Math
o    2005, White: 29%; Black: 19%. Gap = 10 points
o    2007, White: 29%; Black: 26%. Gap = 3 points

10th Grade Proficiency In English
o    2005, White: 46%; Black: 30%. Gap = 16 points
o    2007, White: 52%; Black: 40%. Gap = 12 points

That shows the achievement gap narrowing by 7 percentage points in math and by 4 percentage points in English.

But the gains in other grades are smaller.

Among eighth-graders, the gap tightened by only 1 point in math and 2 points in English. For seventh-graders, the change was 3 points in math, 5 points in English. Sixth grade: 1 point in math, no change in English. In fourth grade scores, the gap narrowed by 1 point in math and widened by 1 point in English. (Some of those are comparisons between 2006 scores and 2007, the only years provided in the test results summary.)

Skinner pointed out an important point about the MCAS: 10th-graders have to pass it in order to graduate.

""They start paying attention,"" she said. 
We also took a look at scores for the following year, comparing the achievement gap between 2007 and 2008. (These charts offer a slightly different comparison from the previous year, which looked at students who scored ""proficient"" on each test. The 2007-08 chart includes those scoring proficient and higher.) The best gains again were made by 10th graders who narrowed the gap by six points in English. But there was no change in the gap in math scores, and lower grades showed only one- or two-point gains, or no improvement at all, and the gap widened in a couple of instances, such as eighth-grade science scores. The 2008-2009 test score summary reflected a similar trend: small gains in some subjects and small setbacks in others.

Beverly Miyares, also with the Massachusetts Teachers Association, added that the dropout rate among black students in Massachusetts increased from 2002 to 2004, rising from 4.9 to 6.3.

That means more under-performing students who dropped out of school didn’t drag down the overall average test scores.

Romney’s role

In claims such as this, we don’t just consider the accuracy but also whether the speaker deserves credit: How responsible was Romney for narrowing the achievement gap?

""The most important point to make with Gov. Romney’s record is that the reform he initiated was part of a much larger and longer movement that existed in Massachusetts,"" said Chad d'Entremont, executive director of the Rennie Center, which provides independent, nonpartisan research to inform public education reform in Massachusetts.

Glenn Koocher, executive director with the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, which represents school boards, was less generous: ""He had nothing to do with it. It’s the teachers in the classrooms who are making the difference.""

Skinner, the expert with the teachers’ union, added that Romney was ""a somewhat absent ‘education’ governor. He was very agenda driven.""

""We would argue that he didn’t put anything in place"" to narrow the gap, she said.

We also wondered whether Romney had pushed any initiatives specifically aimed at helping minority students. Koocher and Skinner both mentioned charter schools, which are favored by many Republicans.

""The charter school program was always popular among minority parents (and) any parents that wanted to get their kids out of the public schools,"" Koocher said, adding that vouchers commonly used to pay tuition at charter schools are unconstitutional in Massachusetts. Instead, the per-pupil state spending is deducted from the public school district’s budget.

Ryan Williams, spokesman for the Romney campaign, said protecting the 1993 reform legislation was an important effort by Romney. He said there were attempts to repeal the graduation requirement, and Romney ""stood firm on that and did not back down.""

""It was one of the bigger things we had success in blocking,"" Williams said. ""A lot of what Romney did when he was governor was to preserve that legislation. He said, ‘I’m not going to roll these standards back."" 
Skinner mentioned another, perhaps less obvious, initiative from Romney that helped many minority students: universal health care. Romney signed a health care reform law in Massachusetts that led to a 98 percent coverage rate.

""In Massachusetts, all of our kids have health insurance, and I don’t think anybody should underestimate the impact that has on learning. Our kids get vaccinated, they can go to the dentist, they can go to the eye doctor,"" she said. ""Their health is less of an issue than it is in other places.""

Our ruling

Romney told the NAACP that when he was governor of Massachusetts, ""not only did test scores improve – we also narrowed the achievement gap.""

State education figures over two years support Romney’s claim about learning gains, although it’s worth noting that some areas declined on his watch, such as the drop-out rate. And it’s always somewhat dubious to take a snapshot of statistics from only one or two years, when, as d'Entremont said ""significant gains in student achievement don’t happen overnight, and the gains in Massachusetts are the result of a 20-year reform effort.""

What’s more, Romney, a single-term governor, should not get all the credit for improvement in the achievement gap, which is influenced by myriad factors.

His statement is partially accurate but omits a lot of important information and overstates his impact. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3F9B00>],/factchecks/2012/jul/18/mitt-romney/romney-says-achievement-gap-massachusetts-improved/
"['Immigration', 'Children', 'Families', 'Homeland Security', 'Wisconsin', 'Reince Priebus']","
Obama ""didn't deliver jack squat"" on pathway to citizenship pledge, GOP chief Reince Priebus says
","In one of his most famous ""Saturday Night Live"" skits, the late Wisconsin-born comedian Chris Farley portrayed Matt Foley, a motivational speaker who lived ""in a van down by the river.""

Lecturing two slacker teens, Foley bellowed: ""Well, I’m here to tell you that you’re probably going to find out as you go out there, that you’re not going to amount to jack squat!""

In other words, that the kids wouldn’t amount to anything.

On June 26, 2012, Wisconsinite Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, invoked the same colloquialism in arguing why President Barack Obama shouldn’t be re-elected.

Addressing immigration with conservative radio talk show host Vicki McKenna, whose show airs in Madison and Milwaukee, Priebus charged that Obama ""promised ‘pathway to citizenship’ and he didn't deliver jack squat on any of it. So, he's already lied to Hispanics -- or, either did that or was so grossly negligent in following through on his promises that it amounts to a lie.""

Obama did indeed promise a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

Has he failed to deliver ""on any of it""?

The pathway

As a candidate for president, Obama pledged to support ""a system that allows undocumented immigrants who are in good standing to pay a fine, learn English and go to the back of the line for the opportunity to become citizens.""

It’s one of more than 500 promises that PolitiFact National tracks on its Obameter.
(PolitiFact Wisconsin is using the Walk-O-Meter to monitor the 2010 campaign promises of Gov. Scott Walker.)

Our colleagues found that Obama, after being elected in 2008, said he would not push immigration reform until 2010, after first tackling issues such as health care reform and financial regulations.

In 2010, Obama and his fellow Democrats pressed forward with the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, better known as the DREAM Act. The measure was intended to give a path to citizenship to illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, as long as they completed schooling or served in the military, and maintained ""good moral character.""

The bill passed the U.S. House of Representatives, but a Republican filibuster prevented it from coming up for a vote in the Senate in December 2010. Chances for passage dimmed when Republicans took control of the House in January 2011.

In its most recent update on Obama’s promise, in May 2011, PolitiFact National found that Obama had recently held meetings on immigration reform, which primarily appeared to be an effort to rally supporters. That was enough for our colleagues to upgrade the status of Obama’s promise from Stalled to In the Works.

In June 2012, Obama signed an executive order allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children to obtain work permits. Under the change, the Department of Homeland Security no longer initiates the deportation of illegal immigrants who came to the country before age 16, have lived here for at least five years, and are in school, are high school graduates or are military veterans in good standing. The immigrants must also be not more than 30 and have clean criminal records.

Those qualifications are similar to those in the DREAM Act. However, Obama himself said at the time: ""This is not a path to citizenship. It is not a permanent fix.""

So, it's clear that Obama pushed for but was not able to enact legislation that would provide a path to citizenship. As an alternative of sorts, he signed an order giving protections to younger illegal immigrants.

Priebus’ evidence

When we asked Republican National Committee spokesman Ryan Mahoney to back Priebus’ claim, he cited a number of news articles about Obama’s promise and how Obama would make it a priority during his first year in office.

Priebus’ claim, however, did not just apply to Obama’s first year, rather that he has not delivered, period.

Two articles Mahoney provided were more on point.

The Los Angeles Times in October 2011 cited what it called ""a lack of progress toward revamping the nation's immigration system"" as one of two reasons for what it described as Obama’s diminished popularity among Latinos.

The article said Obama ""promised in 2008 to push for a comprehensive solution that would offer a path to legal status for the estimated 10 million living here illegally. It never happened.""

In November 2011, The Washington Post reported: ""Immigration advocates have been agitating against Obama since 2009, angry that overhauling immigration policy seemed to take a back seat even as he amped up (deportations)."" Obama's response

Joe Zepecki, spokesman for Obama’s campaign in Wisconsin, said Obama’s immigration reform efforts have been blocked by Republicans. Zepecki also cited news articles about meetings Obama held with lawmakers and immigration reform supporters, statements Obama has made supporting reform and statements he has made criticizing Republicans for blocking his reforms. And Zepecki cited Obama's executive order.

Our rating

Priebus said Obama promised a ""pathway to citizenship"" to immigrants ""and he didn't deliver jack squat on any of it.""

Obama has not delivered the pathway to citizenship, although Priebus does not make it clear that Obama’s effort -- the DREAM Act -- was blocked by Republicans.

That makes Priebus’ statement accurate but needing additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DD96C0>],/factchecks/2012/jul/18/reince-priebus/obama-didnt-deliver-jack-squat-pathway-citizenship/
"['New Jersey', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Lou Greenwald']","
Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald claims money in state budget would provide tax break for all New Jerseyans, including millionaires
","
Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald has been a longtime critic of Gov. Chris Christie for providing tax breaks to millionaires, but apparently he and other Democratic legislators approved a new state budget with funding to do just that.

Those dollars would provide a tax break for ""everyone,"" including people earning more than $1 million, the Camden County Democrat said during a July 15 interview on ""Inside Story"" on Philadelphia-based 6abc.

But PolitiFact New Jersey found Greenwald is wrong to suggest that funding would support an across-the-board tax cut.

Christie originally called for an across-the-board reduction in the state income tax, but the Republican governor and the Democrat-led Legislature have since indicated that any tax cut would likely be limited to individuals below a certain income level and not apply to millionaires.

Also, Greenwald and other Assembly Democrats have advocated for a plan that includes raising taxes on millionaires, not lowering them.

First, here’s the exchange between Greenwald and ""Inside Story"" host Matt O’Donnell.

O’Donnell:  ""Do New Jerseyans deserve a tax break right now? Do all of them deserve a tax break right now, not next year?""

Greenwald: ""The answer to that question is yes, and the money is in the budget to give them a tax break this year.""

O’Donnell: ""Everyone?""

Greenwald: ""Everyone.""

O’Donnell: ""Including people who make more than a million dollars?""

Greenwald: ""Oh, absolutely.""

Now, here’s the history behind the tax cut debate raging in Trenton.

Christie kicked off the discussion with his State of the State address in January, when he called for an across-the board 10 percent cut in the state income tax. That proposal equaled a tax cut for all New Jerseyans.

But Christie and the Democrats have indicated that such an across-the-board cut is now off the table.

In early March, Democrats in the State Senate and the State Assembly each laid out their own tax cut proposals, which only would benefit households earning up to $250,000 per year by providing an income tax credit based on their property taxes.

The key difference between the two proposals was that the Assembly Democrats called for increasing taxes on taxable income exceeding $1 million. 
The Legislature last month approved legislation sponsored by Greenwald to authorize that tax hike. At that point, the tax increase was no longer tied to an income tax credit, but instead to boosting property tax relief payments for residents earning up to $250,000. 
But Christie conditionally vetoed that bill and recommended amending it to implement an income tax credit for homeowners with $400,000 or less in taxable income. The governor’s latest proposal is based on the Senate Democrats’ plan.

Democrats, who set aside $183 million in the fiscal year 2013 budget for a tax cut, have said a reduction only would occur if Christie meets his revenue projections in the coming months.

While it remains unclear whether any tax cut will be approved, Christie and the Legislature have indicated that a reduction would not be an across-the-board cut, but limited to residents below a certain income level and not apply to millionaires.

In response to our findings, Brian McGinnis, communications director for Greenwald, told us the assemblyman’s point was that reducing the property tax burden for the middle class would ultimately benefit all New Jerseyans, including millionaires. 
""The Majority Leader has frequently talked about the hidden tax on all New Jerseyans being the hit a family’s property values take because property taxes are so high,"" McGinnis said in an e-mail. ""In providing significant property tax relief to 95% of New Jersey families, our plan would have addressed this problem — helping to stabilize property values and benefiting people throughout the state, including millionaires.

""Furthermore, as the Majority Leader said in the interview, lower property taxes for the middle-class makes our state a more attractive place to live, meaning millionaires (whom the Governor calls job creators) can attract more talented employees.""

Our ruling

In a TV interview, Greenwald said ""the money is in the budget"" to give a tax break to ""everyone,"" including people making more than $1 million.

But Christie and Democratic legislators have indicated that any tax cut would likely be limited to New Jerseyans below a certain income level and not apply to millionaires. In fact, Greenwald has been a leading advocate of doing just the opposite: raising taxes on millionaires.

We rate the statement False.

"['Georgia', 'Transportation', 'Jeff Dickerson']","
Transportation tax supporter says transit ridership by younger people jumped
","
Supporters of a tax to improve the region’s roads and transit are asking metro Atlantans to think of the children.

A transportation overhaul would create a better Atlanta for generations to come, said Jeff Dickerson, a communications consultant for Citizens for Transportation Mobility, which advocates for the penny-per-dollar sales tax.

What’s more, it would create the kind of transportation system younger people want, Dickerson said during an online debate on PBA.org, the website for Atlanta’s public television and National Public Radio stations.   

""Look at this number from the National Household Travel Survey,"" Dickerson said. ""Between 2001 and 2009 ... ridership among young people age 16 to 34 on transit increased 40 percent over eight years.

Increased 40 percent? Sounds like those young whippersnappers aren’t spending much time behind the wheel of Daddy’s T-Bird.

The referendum is up for a vote July 31 and would raise $7.2 billion over 10 years to upgrade roads and transit across the region.

We called up Dickerson and took a closer look at the data, which comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation.

The National Household Travel Survey tracks how and why people travel. It takes place sporadically. The most recent ones were conducted in 2001 and 2009.

In April of this year, the consumer group U.S. PIRG, a federation of state public interest research groups, and Frontier Group, an environmental think tank, issued ""Transportation and the New Generation,"" a report that analyzed data from this and other surveys.  

We found Dickerson used the correct percentage.

The report found that the average number of miles traveled on transit by a person in this age group increased by 40 percent between 2001 and 2009. Our own analysis of NHTS data and the report’s calculation confirms this.  

In fact, the survey’s other findings indicate these bright young things are relying on ways to travel that don’t involve a car.  

The number of bike trips per person in Generation Y is up about 27 percent, NHTS data said. Walking increased about 16 percent.

Meanwhile, the average number of trips these youngsters take in personal vehicles declined about 18 percent, according to the survey. The miles they travel is down 23 percent.  

Backers of public transit list a host of reasons why.

The report says higher gas prices have pushed younger people to try other means of transportation, as have more stringent state age requirements for driver’s licenses.

Darnell Grisby, director of policy development and research with the American Public Transportation Association, a transit industry group, mentioned findings by a real estate market research company that show that members of Generation Y overwhelmingly prefer walkable communities, whether in the suburbs or city.  

Also, the share of teenagers with driver’s licenses has dropped in recent decades.

In 1983, about 87 percent of 19-year-olds had their licenses, according to a University of Michigan study. By 2008, 75 percent did.

But one NHTS finding about transit use made us wonder whether the dramatic statistic Dickerson used during the debate told the whole story.  

While the average number of person miles that younger people travel on transit skyrocketed, the number of trips they took on transit did not. These increased by only about 4 percent

It appears that 16- to 34-year-olds are hopping on public trains and buses slightly more often but are taking much longer trips.

Why might this be? Baruch Feigenbaum is a transportation policy analyst for the Reason Foundation, a think tank that favors free-market solutions to policy issues.

Since such a small percentage of Americans use transit on their daily commutes, a small jump in the number of people who ride buses and trains might translate into a big percentage increase.

""While transit usage has increased, the gains may not be as impressive as they appear,""  Feigenbaum said.

How do we rule?

We found that the number of per capita passenger miles traveled did increase by 40 percent, the number Dickerson used.

But Dickerson’s use of the word ""ridership"" might have led viewers to think that younger people are taking 40 percent more trips on transit. This number ticked up by only about 4 percent.

By either NHTS measure, it’s fair to say that younger people are leaving Daddy’s T-Bird in the driveway and relying more heavily on transit.

But Dickerson could have been much more precise.

For this reason, Dickerson earns a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972F4540>],/factchecks/2012/jul/18/jeff-dickerson/transportation-tax-supporter-says-transit-ridershi/
"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Debbie Wasserman Schultz']","
Debbie Wasserman Schultz says 80 Ohio counties have links to auto manufacturing
","
Upcoming elections amid a tepid economic recovery have turned monthly employment reports from the U.S. Department of Labor into a regular theme for campaign rhetoric.

June 2012 employment numbers released on July 6 showed a gain of 80,000 jobs and an 8.2 percent national unemployment rate unchanged from the previous month. Each side put their own political spin on the news.

""Fox News Sunday"" host John Roberts hashed over the subject two days later with the chairs of the Republican and Democratic national committees. DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a congresswoman from Florida,  accentuated its positive aspects while repeatedly alluding to likely GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s 2008 advice that the auto industry in Detroit should be permitted to go bankrupt.

""In Ohio,"" Wasserman Schultz noted, ""80 out of 82 counties in Ohio actually have an auto manufacturing facility. So, if it was left to Mitt Romney, they essentially would have all gone out of business because he would have left those folks twisting in the wind.""

It’s widely recognized that the auto industry is a main driver of Ohio’s economy. But PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Wasserman Schultz’s statistics.

To begin with, Ohio has 88 counties, not 82. The Democratic National Committee’s press office did not respond to PolitiFact Ohio’s request for background on her comments, although her claim that 80 of the state’s counties contain auto manufacturing facilities is echoed in a March 2012 report from Obama’s re-election campaign (which got the number of Ohio’s counties right).

""Auto jobs are spread across the state,"" the Obama campaign statement says: ""80 out of 88 counties have at least one auto industry establishment.""

The Obama campaign document cites a statistic from a February 2011 Ohio Department of Development report, which says motor vehicles are produced in 80 of Ohio’s counties.

""The production of motor vehicles, bodies, trailers and parts is diffused across the state - 80 counties have at least one industry establishment,"" that report says. ""One half the jobs were located in 10 counties: Cuyahoga, Hancock, Logan, Lorain, Lucas, Montgomery, Richland, Shelby, Trumbull and Union counties.""

But a June 2012 snapshot of Ohio’s motor vehicle industry produced by the same agency estimates that at least 12 of Ohio’s 88 counties have no motor vehicle industry employees: Adams, Athens, Coshocton, Guernsey, Harrison, Hocking, Jackson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe, Muskingum and Vinton counties. That would put motor vehicle industry workers in 76 of Ohio’s 88 counties.

Ohio Department of Development spokeswoman Stephanie Mennecke told PolitiFact Ohio that the newer document used a more limited definition of the motor vehicle industry than the older report and that could help explain the change. For example, she said the newer report categorizes jobs produced by a Daimler diesel engine remanufacturing plant in Guernsey County are under a code for machinery workers, not motor vehicle industry workers.

It excluded categories like tire manufacturing, tire retreading, and the manufacture of storage batteries that the previous report included in its ""motor vehicle industry"" classification.

Mennecke said that different organizations use different definitions for ""auto industry"" when they produce their statistics, so it can be hard to compare numbers produced by different groups.

Wasserman Schultz’s claim referred specifically to auto manufacturing. The 80 county statistic from the Ohio Department of Development’s 2011 report referred to ""motor vehicle industry"" workers. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics lumps all other motor vehicle makers  into the  automobile category when it tabulates its auto industry employment statistics. Even the Ohio Department of Development varies its definition of ""motor vehicle industry"" in the different reports it produces.

Wasserman Schultz’s claim -- 80 of 82 counties in Ohio have an auto manufacturing facility -- is generally accurate.

While she misstated the total number of counties in the state, she got right the number of counties that have at least one business related to production of motor vehicles, bodies, trailers and parts.  A report from the Ohio Department of Development backs that figure.

A more current report from the Department of Development sets that figure at 76 of Ohio’s 88 counties. But an expert told PolitiFact Ohio that changes in how the industry group is defined could be part of the reason for that change.

That’s additional information that provides clarification.

On the Truth-O-Meter, her claim rates Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C304540>],/factchecks/2012/jul/18/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-80-ohio-counties-hav/
"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama says Mitt Romney calls Arizona immigration law a ""model for the nation""
","
At a San Antonio stop during his July 17, 2012, fundraising swing through Texas, President Barack Obama followed up a defense of the 2010 health-care overhaul by saying: ""We’re not going backwards when it comes to immigration.""

Referring to Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Obama continued:  ""My opponent says the Arizona law should be ‘a model for the nation.’"" Audience members booed. Obama then referred, without details, to his administration’s recent decision not to seek deportations of young, otherwise law-abiding illegal immigrants.

""I believe we can secure our borders and give opportunities to people who are striving and working hard -- especially young people who have been raised in this country and see themselves as Americans.  That was the right thing to do. We're not going backwards; we're going forwards.""

We wondered if Obama journeyed backward by saying Romney called the Arizona immigration law a model for the nation -- which he also said later the same day at the Austin Music Hall.

Noticeably, the president’s statement repeated a claim we checked before by U.S. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez, D-San Antonio. Gonzalez said in a March 27, 2012, conference call organized by the Democratic National Committee that while in Arizona, Romney had said he believes that the state’s much-debated immigration-enforcement law — which originated in 2010 as Senate Bill 1070 — should be the template for federal immigration laws, a stance that Gonzalez described as disturbing.

Gonzalez’s comment to reporters: ""Gov. Romney has actually (said) — while he was in Arizona, of course, and I understand that he was basically maybe playing up to the Arizona crowd — he felt that SB 1070, which has made its way up to the Supreme Court of the United States and will be argued in April, he believes that it should be the template, it should be the model for United States immigration law, not comprehensive immigration reform as the more responsible individuals in Congress have been espousing for a number of years, but an extreme version of an anti-immigrant law passed by the Arizona Legislature.""

After Gonzalez made that statement, the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2012 threw out parts of the Arizona law that would have made state crimes out of federal immigration violations including provisions requiring immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers, making it a state criminal offense for an illegal immigrant to seek work or hold a job and allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants, as reported by The Associated Press.

However, the court let stand a ""show me your papers"" requirement that police officers check the status of people stopped for various reasons who might appear to be in the U.S. illegally. Even then, the AP reported, the justices said the provision could be subject to additional legal challenges. And they removed some teeth by prohibiting officers from arresting people on immigration charges.

According to the AP, Romney did not immediately comment on the decision, though he said he believes that ""each state has the duty — and the right — to secure our borders and preserve the rule of law, particularly when the federal government has failed to meet its responsibilities.""

Now back to whether Romney referred to the Arizona law as a model.

In our check of Gonzalez, DNC spokesman Ricardo Ramirez pointed us to an answer Romney gave during the Feb. 22, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Arizona.
   
We found that Romney did not say in the debate that Arizona's 2010 law should be adopted by Congress in lieu of comprehensive immigration reform; his reply to a question focused instead on a different, older Arizona statute.

That said, we see how his reply could be misread.

As John King of CNN framed his question to Romney, crowd members applauded mention of Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona’s Maricopa County, shown in attendance, who is known for his advocacy of tough immigration policies. Then King said to Romney: ""You've talked, governor, about self-deportation, if businesses do their job, asking for the right documents, the people will leave. But what about arresting? Should there be aggressive, seek them out, find them and arrest them as Sheriff Arpaio advocates?""

""You know, I think you see a model here in Arizona,"" Romney answered. ""They passed a law here that says, that says that people who come here and try and find work, that the employer is required to look them up on E-Verify. This E-Verify system allows employers in Arizona to know who's here legally and who's not here legally. And as a result of E-Verify being put in place, the number of people in Arizona that are here illegally has dropped by some 14 percent, where the national average has only gone down 7 percent.""

E-Verify is a federal, Internet-based system that employers can use to verify whether someone is authorized to work in the United States. Participation is voluntary for most U.S. businesses; there is no federal mandate. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s website says that more than 280,000 employers across the country are using the system.

After the Arizona debate, many reporters, opinion columnists, Democrats and liberal groups interpreted that statement by Romney as him saying that SB 1070 as a whole should be a model, either for the nation or for other states.

However, Dan Nowicki, the Arizona Republic’s national political reporter, questioned those interpretations in a March 3, 2012, news article, pointing out that Arizona’s requirement that businesses use E-Verify is not contained in SB 1070 but in an earlier state law, the Legal Arizona Workers Act.

""It's clear from the (debate) transcript that Romney was describing part of the state's 2007 employer-sanctions law, which has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Nowicki wrote. ""That Arizona law requires employers to use a federal electronic system to verify whether new hires are eligible to work in the United States and provides punishment for companies that hire undocumented immigrants.""

According to Nowicki’s article, Romney spokesman Ryan Williams told the Republic that in the Arizona debate, Romney was referring to the E-Verify requirement as the model and not SB 1070. Williams reiterated that statement to us in an email.

Ramirez, of the DNC, also pointed to the rest of Romney’s debate response in the Feb. 22 debate as backup for Gonzalez’s claim.

The remainder of Romney’s answer: ""So going back to the question that was asked, the right course for America is to drop these lawsuits against Arizona and other states that are trying to do the job Barack Obama isn't doing. And I will drop those lawsuits on day one. I'll also complete the fence. I'll make sure we have enough Border Patrol agents to secure the fence. And I will make sure we have an E-Verify system and require employers to check the documents of workers, and to check E-Verify. And if an employer hires someone that has not gone through E- Verify, they're going to get sanctioned just like they do for not paying their taxes. You do that, and just as Arizona is finding out, you can stop illegal immigration. It's time we finally did it.""

So, Romney in the debate saluted the E-Verify element of a 5-year-old Arizona law — which was not part of the 2010 immigration-enforcement law that Gonzalez says Romney called a model for the nation.

Then again, Romney also said he would end the federal challenge to the 2010 law on his first day as president.

Obama’s campaign, asked to back up his San Antonio claim, emailed a statement describing Romney as extreme on immigration issues. The statement did not show that Romney considers the Arizona law a model for the nation.

Our ruling

Obama could legitimately have targeted Romney’s vow to immediately drop the federal challenge to Arizona’s immigration-enforcement law as president. Instead, the Democrat’s statement mischaracterizes Romney’s salute to Arizona’s 2007 mandate that employers electronically verify the legal status of employees. That E-Verify requirement was not in the 2010 Arizona law.

Paul Ryan says unemployment would be 11 percent with same workforce participation as when Barack Obama took office
","
At the Texas Republican Party’s 2012 convention, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin told the crowd that the high stakes in November’s election include American jobs.

""If the amount of Americans were in the workforce today like they were when President Obama took office, the labor force participation rate, our unemployment rate would be 11 percent today,"" the House Budget Committee chairman said in his keynote speech June 9, 2012.

We decided to check.

First, we defined our terms.

The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the U.S. labor force participation rate by taking the total workforce -- people who are employed or job-hunting -- and dividing by the total civilian population aged 16 or older. (People in military, medical or penal institutions are excluded.)

The general unemployment rate, which is the one most people are familiar with, expresses how many people in the labor force are unemployed.

Generally, climbs and dips in the general unemployment rate are a reasonable indicator that more Americans are losing jobs or getting hired, respectively. But in times of recession, high numbers of workers simply stop looking for jobs. Common reasons they give are retirement, disability, going to school or caring for household members, according to researchers at the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank who drew on federal data.    

But when adults stop looking for work, the overall workforce shrinks, which can have the effect of reducing the unemployment rate -- which could lead to erroneous conclusions about U.S. economic conditions.

To counteract that effect, the BLS also calculates what it calls the U-6 unemployment rate, which folds in people who stopped job-hunting and people who took part-time jobs for economic reasons. Since the U-6 rate was first published in 1994, its three highest points have all accompanied recessions, first in 1990-91, then 2001 and most recently 2007-09.

Of late, Republicans have taken to highlighting this distinction, as Ryan does here.

His claim can be restated this way: If the same percentage of Americans were employed or looking for work in May 2012 as in January 2009, general unemployment would have been 11 percent instead of 8.2 percent.

We asked Ryan’s office for his backup materials, and spokesman Kevin Seifert sent us data, calculations and supporting news coverage.

Seifert told us by email that according to the BLS, the January 2009 workforce participation rate was 65.7 percent, while the May 2012 rate was 63.8 percent. Applying those to the May 2012 population of 243 million, he said, gives a labor force of 159.6 million at the first rate and 155 million at the latter rate.

Subtracting the real labor force (155 million) from the hypothetical labor force (159.6 million) shows ""that 4.6 million more people would actively be seeking work right now instead of being characterized as discouraged, etc.,"" he wrote.

Adding 4.6 million unemployed workers to the May 2012 unemployment count, which was 12.7 million, would give a total 17.3 million unemployed, Seifert said. Then, 17.3 million unemployed people divided by 155 million would give a general unemployment rate of 11.2 percent, Seifert said.

We checked the numbers and math for ourselves, then asked Cheryl Abbot, a Dallas-based regional economist for the labor bureau, for help analyzing the calculations. It looked to us like Ryan should have divided by the hypothetical labor force, rather than the real May 2012 labor force (to correctly describe the unemployment rate of the larger, hypothetical group), and Abbot agreed. But neither that distinction nor small differences due to causes such as rounding off numbers seriously affected the result.

Accepting the assumption that all 4.6 million adults added to the labor force would be unemployed -- and using BLS figures that were not rounded off as much as the ones Seifert used to describe his math to us -- Abbot got a result of 10.9 percent.


Our ruling

The general unemployment rate in June 2012 would have been 10.9 percent if the labor force participation rate had remained at the 65.5 percent in place when Obama became president. That’s about 11 percent.

We rate Ryan’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C071C40>],/factchecks/2012/jul/17/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-unemployment-would-be-11-percent-sa/

Obama ad says Romney stashed money in Cayman Islands
","
A snarky ad juxtaposes an off-key Mitt Romney leading a crowd singing America the Beautiful with claims on the screen saying the Republican candidate has parked millions of his personal fortune far from U.S. shores.

""He had millions in a Swiss bank account,"" the ad says, and in ""tax havens like Bermuda … and the Cayman Islands.""

It ends with: ""Mitt Romney’s not the solution.""

We rated the Swiss bank account claim True. Here we’ll dig into the Cayman Islands charge.

Romney has released his tax return for 2010 and an estimate for 2011 indicating that his income was $21.7 million in 2010 and $20.9 million last year. His financial disclosure, which is required of all presidential candidates, shows that Romney’s personal wealth is somewhere between $85 million and $264 million, according to the Washington Post.

News organizations have analyzed how Romney has invested his money, gleaned the greatest tax benefits and maximized profits at Bain Capital, the private equity firm he founded.

The Cayman Islands is mentioned in several of the reports:

* Romney utilized shell companies in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda to attract foreign investors to Bain, according to 2007 documents analyzed by the Los Angeles Times.

The Times identified one such fund as BCIP Associates III Cayman. It’s listed on Romney’s 2007 financial disclosure as having paid him more than $1 million the previous year in dividends, interest and capital gains.

* Early in 2012, ABC News reported that Romney ""has as much as $8 million invested in at least 12 funds listed on a Cayman Islands registry. Another investment, which Romney reports as being worth between $5 million and $25 million, shows up on securities records as having been domiciled in the Caymans.""

That fund, called BCIP Trust Associates III, is part of his individual retirement account and provided between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 in income, the disclosure shows.

David S. Miller, a tax attorney with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP in New York, told PolitiFact that tax-exempt entities, including IRA accounts, sometimes invest through Cayman Islands corporations to reduce their U.S. taxes. ""Congress did not deliberately allow tax-exempts to reduce their U.S. taxes by investing through Cayman Islands corporations,"" Miller said. ""However, the practice is widespread and the IRS has approved of it.""

Miller agreed that it’s accurate to call the Cayman Islands a tax haven.

""That phrase usually refers to whether the jurisdiction imposes taxes and the Cayman Islands doesn’t,"" he said.

Other, more nuanced advantages exist for high net-worth individuals who put their money in foreign corporations. For example, a high net-worth individual can’t deduct the management fee paid to a fund manager, but a foreign corporation can.

""There are other advantages for U.S. taxpayers who invest through foreign corporations. They’re relatively subtle, but the advantages increase as the tax rates increase,"" Miller said.

Finally, in a transcript of a conference call hosted by the Romney campaign in January 2012, the trustee for the Romney family’s financial investments -- Brad Malt of the law firm Ropes & Gray -- acknowledged the existence of the Cayman investments.

""These are investments in third-party entities,"" Malt said, likening them to stock in Toyota.

He continued: ""Each of these investments is in a blind trust. … This means the decision to make the investment was made by me, not by Gov. Romney. … I should say I, in turn, have no control over where these funds are formed. … When we make an investment in a Cayman fund, we're presented with investment documents, the sponsor has already chosen where the fund is to be organized, and to be perfectly clear, the blind trusts are a tiny part of the investor base of these funds.""

He went on to emphasize that each of the Cayman funds files a U.S. tax return, which reports the blind trust's share of the fund income. ""Every dime of that, in turn, is reported on Gov. Romney's tax returns,"" Malt said.

When we asked the Romney campaign for a response to the Obama ad, a spokesman emphasized these same points -- that Romney has paid all taxes he owed, that investment decisions were made by the trustee and the trustee does not decide where the funds are ""domiciled.""

Our ruling

Obama’s ad says Romney had millions of dollars in the tax-friendly Cayman Islands.

Romney’s trustee acknowledged investing Romney’s money in funds located there, and several are listed on his financial disclosures. Those forms indicate the value of those investments is in the millions.

There's no evidence of anything illegal or improper, but it's clear that Romney had millions in the Caymans. We rate the claim from the Obama ad True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280F3EF66C0>],/factchecks/2012/jul/17/barack-obama/obama-ad-says-romney-stashed-money-cayman-islands/

A real photo of Trayvon Martin? Chain email makes false claim
","There’s more to Trayvon Martin’s appearance than the media would have you know, a chain email claims.

Martin is the 17-year-old Miami Gardens resident who was shot in February by volunteer neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman. The answer is attached within the email, ""Is This Little Trayvon Martin.""

Here, Trayvon is bigger and stronger than the boy we’ve seen in the hoodie. This Trayvon has facial hair. He’s inked up from his hands to his neck. His right cheek bears a can’t-miss tattoo -- a red star inset with ""LA,"" in the style of the Los Angeles Dodgers logo.

The email accuses reporters of deceiving the public by suppressing this photo and publishing photos of a younger Trayvon after his death. Then it complains the media won't report the 17-year-old’s disciplinary problems. Actually, the Miami Herald reported his suspensions and getting caught with marijuana and women’s jewelry. The email ends with a rant about the divisive, liberal agenda of the media. ""They don't show the up-to-date pictures of Trayvon Martin, in the media,"" the email says. ""Now you know why. Kinda scary, ain't it?""

A couple readers asked us to investigate the photo in their inboxes. As we suspected, it’s not Trayvon Martin. We will note that after Trayvon's death a much younger picture of him provided by the family got a lot of press. But this email goes way off the mark.

This man is Jayceon Terrell Taylor, also known as Game, a 32-year-old rapper from Compton, Calif., near Los Angeles.

Formerly known as The Game, he earned Grammy nominations in 2006 for his collaboration with rapper 50 Cent on ""Hate It or Love It.""

Game weighed in on the Trayvon Martin controversy in a March 2012 interview with MTV.com: ""I'm far from racist. I'm very educated and intellectual and I understand how life works and how people of all colors exist under the sun, but it just seems like more than not black people are, I don't know, there's always some negative occurrence that goes on in our existence. This is just another reminder that stupidity still exists.""

As for the right cheek tattoo, it used to be a butterfly. Game concealed it with the Dodgers logo and red star after a lot of criticism. ""I’m the face of L.A., so I put L.A. on my face,"" he once said.

A publicist for the rapper said this picture was probably snapped during a photoshoot with XXL Magazine, though he wasn’t sure when. It’s no matter. We have enough information here to make our ruling.

House speaker says 9/11 regulations led to new Georgia guidelines
","
If you’ve had to renew your driver’s license lately, you know by now not to leave the engine running because you’ll likely have to wait.

There’ve been scores of news accounts in recent weeks about Georgians waiting in long lines to renew their license, thanks to new rules that took effect earlier this month requiring drivers to present more personal records to confirm their identity.

So who’s to blame for this new round of regulation? Many drivers have pointed their fingers toward the state Department of Driver Services.

David Ralston, speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives, told reporters he was disappointed how the state agency prepared for the changes. However, the Republican lawmaker from Blue Ridge offered an explanation for the new regulations that suggested it is beyond the state’s control.

Many of the changes that the state made were required by federal law, so state lawmakers' hands were tied, Ralston said, according to the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer.

Ralston’s spokesman, Marshall Guest, confirmed that’s what his boss said and suggested some paths for us to use to find more details.

PolitiFact Georgia wondered if the speaker was correct, or was he incorrectly designating the new level of bureaucracy to the wrong people?

Georgia DDS officials say the changes were necessitated by a 2005 law passed by Congress called the Real ID Act.

The act, which took effect three years after it passed, says that federal agencies may not accept a driver’s license or other state-issued forms of identification, unless the state meets rules under the federal law to verify the person’s identity. The act says a driver’s license should include the person’s full legal name, date of birth, gender, picture, driver’s license number, address, signature and physical features.

The federal government has specific guidelines about what it requires from states, and Georgia says it is trying to follow suit. States should require a person to present a document without a photo that contains the driver’s full legal name and date of birth and Social Security number, the federal law says.

The Real ID Act was passed as part of a Homeland Security measure after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  

States were given the opportunity to get an extension to comply with the law. In 2007, the Georgia Legislature passed Senate Bill 5, which delayed implementation of the federal law until the governor felt comfortable the law would protect Georgians from identity theft. The state bill expressed concerns that the federal law would cost states $11 billion over the first five years of the program and that the federal government had not provided any money for its implementation. The state bill also mentioned worries that the federal law didn’t mention protections for information privacy or data security.

Since 2007, state DDS officials have been working to meet the federal guidelines under the Real ID Act in phases. This May, Gov. Nathan Deal’s office announced it had created a system called SecureID that will protect Georgians from identity theft and comply with the Real ID Act.

""This program will give Georgians the most secure IDs we’ve ever issued in this state,"" Deal said in a press release. ""It is our duty to protect our residents’ identities to the best of our ability.""

So now, you’ll need proof of your full legal name, Social Security number and address to renew your driver’s license.

It may not comfort some motorists as they stand in line to renew their license, but the new guidelines do come from the federal law passed in 2005. We rate Ralston’s statement as True.

 Has Portland-Milwaukie light rail project created more than 1,500 jobs?
","
PolitiFact Oregon takes job creation claims very seriously. It’s a popular way to justify taxpayer spending. But sometimes, the numbers just don’t add up.

Case in point: A recent claim by U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., that transportation projects created more than one-third of the 2009 stimulus bill’s total jobs. We gave a nod to his methodology but found no independent evidence to back up his claim.

The latest job-creation number to catch our eye? TriMet, the metro area’s transit agency, says that the $1.5 billion Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail Project created 1,525 direct jobs as of June 11, 2012. That includes 659 on-site construction jobs since April 2011, and 866 professional and technical jobs since March 2009. (The numbers have been revised up for July.)

We wanted to know whether those jobs would not have existed but for the light rail project -- which is how we think the average person interprets the word ""created"" -- and we wanted to know the duration of those jobs.

We should back up for a moment and talk about why this matters.

As we said, job numbers are a popular way to justify taxpayer spending. It’s easier to get behind an expensive roads project that will provide paychecks for construction workers, engineers,  managers and so forth in the private sector.

This is not new. Back in 1986, when the first light-rail line to Gresham was built, officials said the 15-mile line had developed some 1,200 jobs, according to a news story in The Oregonian. (This juicy nugget was pointed out by John Charles, president and CEO of the Cascade Policy Institute, a right-leaning think tank that advocates limited government and disapproves of light-rail.) Fast forward to today, where the projection for a smaller 7.3-mile line is ""up to 14,500 jobs,"" about half of which are ""direct"" jobs.

Economic development is obviously a big part of selling the the new light -rail line to the public. There’s a web page devoted to the subject: ""The Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail Transit Project is essential to the long-term economic vitality of our region, helping to connect people to their jobs and higher education. It also is providing many short-term benefits for the regional economy.""

Spokeswoman Mary Fetsch and Dan Blocher, TriMet’s executive director of capital projects, explained how the agency calculated the numbers. The methodology differs depending on the job. Construction jobs, for example, are tracked by name, regardless of duration. Some people may work for a year, others for two weeks, Blocher said, and the jobs figure does not differentiate.

Technical and professional jobs are calculated differently. There’s no certified payroll list, as there is for construction contractors, so TriMet goes through billings by hand and counts heads. He said the agency counted workers who had worked at least 160 hours on the project -- which is equal to one month -- and came up with 866 jobs. Many of these jobs are now gone since the project has moved into the construction phase.

What have we learned?  

The jobs created number does not differentiate between people employed for months and people employed for weeks. Certainly a job is a job, and that’s something for people who don’t have a job, but let’s be clear that these are not all long-term positions, even for a transit project that we know is temporary by nature.

Nor is it clear that all jobs are jobs that didn’t exist before the light rail project. When we hear that a project created 1,525 direct jobs, we picture 1,525 new jobs that wouldn’t have existed but for the project. But that may not be the case. We don’t know how many of the contracted companies -- if any -- hired new people for new positions. TriMet doesn’t know either. We should also note that about 100 jobs are in-house, with TriMet.

Is it fair, we asked, to include short-term jobs and TriMet jobs in the number of jobs created? Is it accurate to use the word ""create"" when maybe the better word is ""sustain""? Perhaps we’re being overly picky, but we think officials should take extra care when talking about what a public project can or cannot do in terms of jobs. (Ditto for private sector companies that take public subsidies for projects.)  

Fetsch defended the figures: ""I don’t think they’re inflated from my layperson’s perspective.""

She also explained that numbers are there to give people an idea of what happens when you put a shock of money into a region, like a $1.5 billion transportation project. We agree that’s a fair point to make, but it won’t affect our ruling.

Finally, we reached out to Chuck Sheketoff, executive director of the Oregon Center for Public Policy, a left-leaning think tank that advocates for middle- and low-income families. To him, a public agency or private contractor can claim a job is created only when the company has hired a new person for a new position in anticipation of that work. Also, it matters whether the work is part-time, full-time, weeks-long or years-long.

""Public agencies ought to be clear about creating temporary or full-time jobs. Everybody ought to,"" said Sheketoff.

We think so, too. We’re relieved to know TriMet's numbers weren't produced from thin air, and find the statement somewhat accurate.

But without knowing what the numbers mean or the definition of ""created,"" a reader could easily think the light-rail project resulted in more than 1,500 brand-new full-time, long-term jobs when really, it’s far more accurate to say that the transit project has provided work for more than 1,500 people.

We find the statement Half True, partially accurate but missing important details.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D17240>],/factchecks/2012/jul/16/trimet/has-portland-milwaukie-light-rail-project-created-/

Mitt Romney had millions in a Swiss bank account, Barack Obama campaign ad says
","
President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign is using hard-edged irony to attack Mitt Romney in a new ad that pairs Romney singing ""America the Beautiful"" with a series of claims about Bain Capital and his use of offshore accounts in his personal finances.

In this item, we’ll look at the claim that Romney ""had millions in a Swiss bank account.""

Romney has released tax returns for 2010 and an estimated tax return for 2011, in addition to a number of financial disclosure forms. Each of these forms is lengthy and, unless you're an accountant, difficult to decipher.

However, the question of whether the Obama campaign is correct to say that Romney ""had millions in a Swiss bank account"" is not in doubt, since the trustee for the Romney family’s financial investments -- Brad Malt of the law firm Ropes & Gray -- acknowledged it in an on-the-record call with journalists on Jan. 24, 2012.

Malt said on the call, ""Yeah, it occurs to me that one other question that came up. …  Why is there a Swiss bank account listed on the Romney's tax return? It is listed because I set that account up for diversification in 2003, when I became trustee of the blind trusts. It is a bank account. Nothing more, nothing less. An ordinary bank account. It earns some income, which is fully reported on the Form 1040 in the (2010) tax return. You'll see approximately $1,700 of interest earned by this account, which is reported. The tax is fully paid just as if this were a U.S. bank account, nothing more complicated than that.""

Malt added, ""By the way, I did close this account in early 2010. It no longer exists.""

Reporters on the call offered two follow-up questions about the Swiss bank account. One asked, ""Why was that Swiss bank account closed in 2010?""

Malt responded, ""I previously said that I regularly review Gov. Romney's investments and just in connection with one of my periodic reviews, I decided that this account wasn't serving any particular purpose. It might or might not be consistent with Gov. Romney's political views. You know, again, taxes were all fully paid, etc., but it just wasn't worth it, and I closed the account.""

The second question asked the Romney camp to ""elaborate on which institution held the Swiss account, how much the account held and whether the account also worked with any trusts or foundations.""

Malt responded that ""the Swiss bank account was in the Ann Romney blind trust. It held approximately $3 million. It was just an investment of the trust -- the bank account of the trust -- which, as I mentioned, I have subsequently closed. The bank was, sorry, Union Bank Switzerland -- UBS.""

Malt’s comments confirm that Romney ""had millions in a Swiss bank account"" because the couple filed their returns jointly, and the campaign has disclosed tax returns for Ann Romney’s trusts and family trusts, not just Romney’s funds.

Meanwhile, the Romney campaign also retroactively disclosed that the couple had a Swiss account in his 2006 presidential financial disclosure form, apparently the same one that was closed in 2010. In the 2006 disclosure form, the UBS money market account was listed as being worth between $1 million and $5 million.

We should note that there’s no indication that Romney did anything improper by having some of his assets in a Swiss bank account -- assets, we’ll reiterate, that were placed in the account by Malt, not by Romney. The purpose of a blind trust is to have a money manager make investment decisions so that a public official is protected from the appearance of a conflict of interest.

The Romney campaign said the account was legal and disclosed to the IRS and the U.S. Treasury. Income from the account was included in the Romney’s tax returns and all U.S. taxes due were paid during the period, the campaign said.

Our ruling

The trustee who managed Romney’s holdings has publicly confirmed that Mitt and Ann Romney had ""approximately $3 million"" in assets in a Swiss bank account between 2003 and 2010, and the Romney campaign did not object to that characterization when we contacted them for this story. 
Swiss bank accounts may make good fodder for campaign commercials and Jason Bourne movies, but there's nothing to indicate Romney did anything illegal or improper with the account. While it is now closed, the claim in Obama’s ad was stated in the past tense -- that Romney ""had millions in a Swiss bank account."" That’s correct, so we rate Obama’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A51740>],/factchecks/2012/jul/16/barack-obama/mitt-romney-had-millions-swiss-bank-account-barack/

Steve Doocy says someone earning $250,000 pays half that in taxes
","
Steve Doocy, one of the co-hosts of Fox & Friends, last week took aim at President Barack Obama’s longstanding proposal to let the George W. Bush-era tax cuts expire for taxpayers making $250,000 and up.

""If you make more than $250,000 a year, (President Obama wants to) jack up your taxes about 5 percent,"" Doocy said on the July 11 edition of the show. ""But when you think about it, at $250,000 you only really take home about $125,000, which in some parts of the country, if you've got a couple of kids in college, is not much money.""

A reader asked us to check whether Doocy was right that a typical taxpayer earning $250,000 a year would be left with only $125,000 in take-home pay. (Fox’s media office did not return an inquiry for this story.)

The main taxes we’ll consider here are federal income taxes, federal payroll taxes and state income taxes.

• Federal income taxes: A table produced by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center offers data on the ""effective tax rate"" -- that is, how much a filer paid in income tax divided by their income -- for various income ranges. More than a third of those earning $200,000 and up had an effective tax rate between 15 percent and 20 percent. Just under one-third had an effective rate between 20 and 25 percent. So, if you’re earning $250,000, this means you’re pretty typical if you’re paying between $37,500 and $62,500 in federal income taxes.

• Federal payroll taxes: An employee will pay Social Security taxes (6.2 percent on the first $110,100 of salary) and Medicare taxes (1.45 percent of all of their salary). Someone who’s self employed will pay twice that, to cover the employer’s share. So the payroll tax can add an additional $8,000 to $17,000 to the tax bill.

• State income taxes: State income taxes vary widely; in fact, some states have no income tax at all. A 5 percent state income tax, which is somewhere in the middle of the pack, could add an additional $10,000 to $12,500, or perhaps less, depending on how many deductions are being taken.

Adding these three tax categories together and subtracting them from $250,000 gives us a range of take-home pay from $158,000 to $194,500. Either figure is well above the $125,000 in take-home pay that Doocy claims.

Is it possible to get the taxes so high they can cut take home pay for $250,000 to just half? Let’s construct an extreme example to see if it gets us there.

Using the IRS’ tax calculator, we plugged in information for an individual who earned a $250,000 salary, without any other non-salary income such as capital gains.

Although this would shock our hypothetical taxpayer’s hypothetical CPA, we assumed the taxpayer refused to use even the most basic deductions beyond the standard deduction. No home-mortgage deduction, charitable donations, child credit or IRAs. And no offshore tax shelters.

According to the IRS calculator, this unlucky taxpayer would owe the IRS $63,811 in federal income taxes. Add in payroll taxes ($8,817 to $17,634) and income taxes for the state with the highest rate, Hawaii (roughly $25,000) and it brings you to, at worst, take-home pay of $143,555.

So, even in this extreme and highly improbable example, the taxpayer takes home more money than the $125,000 Doocy claimed.

We checked our math with Steve Street, an accountant with the firm Ross & Moncure in Alexandria, Va. He ran a hypothetical tax return for a single New Yorker earning $250,000, first as an employee and then as a self-employed businessperson, with no deductions beyond the standard deduction. The employee takes home $153,629, while the self-employed businessperson takes home $148,408.

One might be tempted to throw other taxes into the equation. However, tax experts do not typically include property taxes or sales taxes in such comparisons because they are so variable and require too many assumptions about behavior, said William McBride of the Tax Foundation. Assuming that someone has a house or property with a large tax bill is ""not a normal assumption to make,"" McBride said. ""You could also get there with sales taxes, but again you’d have to make some very particular assumptions about consumption which are not very representative.""

Even if you take this inadvisable course of adding in property taxes, it’s highly unlikely that they could provide the additional $20,000 in taxation needed to hit Doocy’s benchmark even in this extreme case. For instance, to return to our Hawaii example, the state’s highest median property tax payment for any county is $1,463, in Honolulu County. So to make it to Doocy’s $125,000 level you’d need to be stuck with a property tax bill almost 14 times the county’s median.

Bottom line? ""Doocy is stretching it,"" McBride said.

Our ruling 
Doocy said someone who earns $250,000 a year ends up with take-home pay of just $125,000. But typical taxpayers end up with comfortably more than that. We found someone with that salary would take home $158,000 to $194,500 -- and even more if they lived in a state without income tax. 
Even our most extreme example produced quite a bit more take-home pay than he suggested. We rate Doocy’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809689C240>],/factchecks/2012/jul/16/steve-doocy/steve-doocy-says-someone-earning-250000-pays-half-/

Fines are possible, but for uninsured
","
In an appearance on

Meet the Press

with a little more than a week to go before Election Day, John McCain criticized Barack Obama's health plan as too burdensome to many Americans.
 
""I think that we cannot fine small business people ... small business people who have employees without health insurance, that he's going to fine them if they don't have the insurance policy that Senator Obama wants them to have, that if they have children that don't have health insurance that Senator Obama wants them to have, they will be fined,"" McCain said.
 
We've previously checked McCain's statement that Obama wants to fine small businesses that don't participate in his health plan and

found it False

. Now we'll look at the statement that ""if they have children that don't have health insurance that Senator Obama wants them to have, they will be fined.""
 
Obama's health plan does have a mandate that children have insurance, and it would likely include an eventual fine once all the elements of the health plan are in place. Here's how Obama explained it in an interview with the

Indianapolis Recorder

published Oct. 24, 2008:



""We would not impose a penalty until we’ve ensured the (State Children's Health Insurance Program) and other programs have made it absolutely affordable for every child to be covered. My belief is that you’ve got to make sure people have an option before you start fining them. Once we’ve got the options in place, we’d impose a fine in the ballpark of what it’d cost to provide insurance for their child. ... Children are relatively cheap to insure. We’re going to be providing subsidies to make sure people can afford them, but we’re also going to expect our parents are showing some responsibility in signing up their kids.""

 

So McCain is right about a possible fine, even if he doesn't mention that it would not be imposed until after the program is in place.

 

We have a bigger problem with McCain's explanation that people get fined if their children ""d

on't have health insurance that Senator Obama wants them to have."" Actually, the fine is if the children are uninsured, not if they are insured under a certain

type

of plan. Obama wants all children to be insured, but he leaves many options through which this could occur. One of the central premises of Obama's plan is that people who are currently insured keep the insurance they have.
 
So we find McCain is correct to say that the parents of children could face fines, but he is wrong to imply that it's the type of coverage that matters. We rate his statement Half True.

The Coke theme song and more ridiculous allegations
","
We've seen a lot of groundless and ridiculous chain e-mails during the 2008 campaign.
 
There was the one that

fabricated Bible verses

to suggest Barack Obama fit the profile for the Antichrist; there was another that

falsified a list of books

that Sarah Palin supposedly sought to ban; and there was our all-time favorite, which

falsely claimed

 Obama wants the national anthem to be

I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing

.
 
We always liked that song when it was the Coca-Cola theme, and the chain e-mail provided a fun excuse in April to

watch the commercial

on YouTube. So it was a treat when several readers sent us a new e-mail that includes the national anthem quote along with some other equally ridiculous ones. (You can read the

full e-mail here

.)   
 
The e-mail has been widely circulated and posted on dozens of blogs because it has a few elements that make it look authentic. It says that Obama made the remarks ""on Sunday's Televised 'Meet the Press,' "" and the account appears to be written by Dale Lindsborg of the

Washington Post

. And unless you are a keen student of cola advertising, you might miss the satirical suggestion about the song.   
 
So let's put the Coke song on the turntable as we examine the new e-mail.
 
It begins, like so many chain e-mails attacking Obama, with a subject line that invokes patriotism: ""Meet the Press - read this if you're an American.""
 
It says the account is ""a narrative taken from Sunday Morning's televised 'Meet the Press', and the author is employed by none other than the Washington Post.""
 
It says that on the Sept. 7 show, Obama was asked by ""General Bill Ginn' USAF (ret.)"" why he doesn't follow protocol when the national anthem is played. (That question is based on

a photograph of Obama

standing with his hands folded at his waist while Sen. Hillary Clinton and others have their hands over their hearts. It has been misinterpreted in many chain e-mails as an indication that Obama refuses to say the Pledge of Allegiance, which we addressed

with this article

.)
 
During the

Meet the Press

appearance, Obama is said to have replied, ""As I've said about the flag pin, I don't want to be perceived as taking sides. . . .There are a lot of people in the world to whom the American flag is a symbol of oppression. And the anthem itself conveys a war-like message. You know, the bombs bursting in air and all. It should be swapped for something less parochial and less bellicose. I like the song 'I'd Like To Teach the World To Sing.' If that were our anthem, then I might salute it.""
 
Obama, it says, continued: ""We should consider to reinvent our National Anthem as well as to redesign our Flag to better offer our enemies hope and love. It's my intention, if elected, to disarm America to the level of acceptance to our Middle East Brethren. If we as a Nation of warring people, should conduct ourselves as the nations of Islam, whereas peace prevails. Perhaps a state or period of mutual concord between our governments. When I become President, I will seek a pact or agreement to end hostilities between those who have been at war or in a state of enmity, and a freedom from disquieting oppressive thoughts. We as a Nation have placed upon the nations of Islam an unfair injustice.""
 
It then abruptly shifts gears to his comments about his wife Michelle: ""My wife disrespects the Flag for many personal reasons. Together she and I have attended several flag burning ceremonies in the past, many years ago. She has her views and I have mine. Of course now, I have found myself about to become the President of the United States and I have put aside my hatred. I will use my power to bring CHANGE to this Nation, and offer the people a new path of hope. My wife and I look forward to becoming our Country's First Family. Indeed, CHANGE is about to overwhelm the United States of America.""
 
It is signed ""Dale Lindsborg, Washington Post.""
 
It would be difficult to tally the many, many ways this e-mail is false, but we'll start with the obvious ones. First, Obama was not on

Meet the Press

on Sept. 7. The guests were Joe Biden and

New York Times

columnist Thomas Friedman. Nor was Gen. Bill Ginn on the show.
 
Ginn is indeed a retired Air Force general and not a fan of Obama. In an interview with PolitiFact, Ginn cited Obama's association with Weather Underground co-founder William Ayers, the group ACORN and his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, as just a few examples why he does not want Obama to be president.
 


But Ginn said the

Meet the Press

account was fabricated and that he had never spoken to Obama. Ginn said his name might have gotten attached to the e-mail because of a message he sent to a friend expressing concern about Obama not putting his hand over his heart during the national anthem.


 
Neither is Dale Lindsborg a reporter at the

Washington Post

. Anne Kornblut, a real political reporter from the

Post

, said in an online chat that she checked the paper's directory and couldn't find anyone by that name.
 
And, Obama's quote is fabricated. It seems to be a mashup from at least two sources. The anthem part comes from 

a satirical column

published on the Web in October 2007 by Arizona writer John Semmens that produced the original bogus e-mail that we checked last spring.
 
We couldn't determine the origin of the part about redesigning the American flag ""to better offer our enemies hope and love,"" but a search of the Project Vote Smart database of Obama's speeches indicates he has not uttered the phrase. He also has not made the remark about his wife disrespecting the flag, according to the Vote Smart database.
 
This chain e-mail, like most that we've checked, is false. In fact, it's so ridiculously, maliciously false, that it sets the Truth-O-Meter ablaze. Pants on Fire.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'National Republican Trust PAC']","
Not much of a plan here
","
With a new television ad, a conservative group is trying to revive the debate over drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants, which flared up in the Democratic nomination race but has not been a major issue in the general election.
 
The ad debuted on Oct. 21, 2008, and is set to run in Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and other swing states, according to scriptwriter and producer Rick Wilson.
 
""Millions of illegal aliens in the U.S.,"" begins the spot, paid for by an independent political action committee called the National Republican Trust. ""Barack Obama's plan gives a driver's license to any illegal who wants one.""
 
For good measure, the spot includes an image of 9/11 ringleader Mohamed Atta on a driver's license.
 
Since the ad made an allegation about ""Obama's plan,"" we checked his Web site for any plan that mentioned drivers' licenses for undocumented immigrants.
 
We couldn't find one. Obama's

immigration plan

doesn't have anything to say on the subject.
 
In phone interviews, Wilson and the PAC's executive director, Scott Wheeler, pointed to comments made by Obama in three debates during the Democratic primary as evidence for the claim.
 
In the first debate, on Oct. 30, 2007, NBC's Brian Williams asked Obama whether he was for or against a plan by then-Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York to grant licenses to illegal immigrants.
 
""I think that it is a — the right idea,"" Obama said. ""Because there is a public safety concern. We can make sure that drivers who are illegal come out of the shadows, that they can be tracked, that they are properly trained, and that will make our roads safer.""
 
In another debate, on Nov. 15, 2007, CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Obama, ""Do you support or oppose drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants?""
 
""I am not proposing that that's what we do,"" Obama said. ""I have already said I support the notion that we have to deal with public safety and that drivers' licenses at the state level can make that happen. ... But what I also know, Wolf, is that if we keep on getting distracted by this problem, then we are not solving it.""
 
Blizter went on to press for a yes or no answer.
 
""Yes,"" Obama said.
 
In a third debate, on Jan. 31, 2008, Obama said: ""On the drivers' license issue, I don't actually want — I don't believe that we're going to have to deal with this if we have comprehensive immigration reform because, as I said before, people don't come here to drive, they come here to work.""
 
He continued, ""I agree with Bill Richardson (who supported granting drivers' licenses to undocumented immigrants) that there is a public safety concern here and that we're better off — because I don't want a bunch of hit-and-run drivers because they're worried about being deported and so they don't report an accident.""
 
So yes, Obama did indeed endorse the idea of granting drivers' licenses to illegal immigrants.
 
But does that amount to a ""plan"" to do so?
 
In the context of the presidential campaign, we think of a ""plan"" as a specific course of intended action a candidate has laid out, usually in writing. Voicing support at a debate for an idea — especially couched in qualifiers such as ""I don't believe that we're going to have to deal with this,"" and ""I am not proposing that that's what we do"" — is a far cry from having a plan to do so.
 
""When we say 'Obama's plan' we're saying it's part of his plans, not necessarily that he's created a plan,"" Wheeler said.
 
But it's not part of his immigration plans. We also note that drivers' licenses are handled on the state level, and Obama is running for federal office.
 
The federal government can impose standards on states for drivers' licenses that would be federally recognized — and in fact Congress did so in 2005 when it passed elements of what had been known as the Real ID Act. It said states have to require ""valid documentary evidence that the person (applying for a license) is a citizen or national of the United States"" or has applied for any of several types of legal status.
 
Obama voted for that bill, which passed 99-0. We could not find any evidence that he had a plan to change those requirements, other than his debate comments, which don't amount to much of a plan.
 
Finally, Obama saying he favored the idea of giving drivers' licenses to undocumented immigrants is different from saying he would give them to ""any illegal who wants one,"" as the ad claimed. If Obama were to offer a specific plan on the subject, who knows what restrictions it would include?
 
Certainly not the National Republican Trust.
 
So this group is guilty of some serious hyperbole. It took words of support from Obama for the concept of granting drivers' licenses to illegal immigrants and portrayed them not just as a specific plan, but as one that would hand licenses out like candy. We find it Barely True.

Extra taxes possible for high earners
","A campaign mailer from the Republican Party of Florida attacked Barack Obama on the issue of the economy. We received the mailer on Oct. 22, 2008. ""How do Barack Obama's plans impact your budget?"" reads the mailer. ""Will you count on Social Securty? Obama plan: Raise Social Security taxes."" Obama has floated proposals to raise Social Security taxes, but only on those who have incomes of about $250,000 a year and above. To be clear, when we talk about Social Security taxes, we're talking about payroll taxes paid by workers who have not yet retired (  not  taxes on the benefits of retirees). Most workers currently pay 6.2 percent of their earnings in Social Security taxes, on earnings up to a limit of about $102,000 in 2008. If you want to look at your own pay stub, the line that represents Social Security taxes is usually labeled FICA OASDI, which stands for Federal Insurance Contributions Act Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance. Now you know. The Social Security system is expected to need more money after the baby boomers retire. One of Obama's proposals to address problems with the program is to begin taxing benefits on higher incomes that are now exempt. He proposes to start taxing income of $250,000 and higher at a rate somewhere between 2 and 4 percent, and this includes an employer contribution, so the cost to the worker would likely be between 1 and 2 percent. By the way, people who make $250,000 or more make up roughly 3 percent of everyone who files taxes. So Obama does propose raising Social Security taxes. But the raise would hit only a small portion of the population. We find the Republican Party of Florida's statement to be overly broad and rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972A6980>],/factchecks/2008/oct/23/republican-party-florida/extra-taxes-possible-for-high-earners/
"['Abortion', 'National', 'John McCain']","
McCain abortion record is consistent.
","
Back during the Republican primaries, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney accused John McCain of flip-flopping on abortion. Romney was actually defending his own changes of position by arguing that other politicians change position, too.
 
""(McCain) said he was opposed to overturning Roe v. Wade. Now he's for overturning Roe v. Wade,"" Romney said in April 2007.
 
The charge stems from remarks McCain made on the campaign trail when he was running for president in 1999. McCain had answered written questionnaires saying he opposed Roe v. Wade, but when the

San Francisco Chronicle

and CNN asked him about it that year, McCain said, ""I'd love to see a point where it (the court ruling) is irrelevant, and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary. But certainly in the short-term, or even the long-term, I would not support repeal of Roe vs. Wade, which would then force X number of women in America to (undergo) illegal and dangerous operations.""
 
Anti-abortion Republicans immediately criticized the statement, and McCain aides started backpedaling, noting that McCain misspoke when he used the phrase “even in the long term.” McCain said in an interview a few months later, “I clearly misspoke there. I’m a person who’s made mistakes in this campaign, and I’ll continue to make mistakes. My voting record is clear, of 17 years of pro-life. I continue to hold that position, and I … continue to believe that Roe vs. Wade was a very flawed decision, as in the opinion of most experts.”
 
In South Carolina in 2007, McCain said, “I do not support Roe versus Wade. It should be overturned.” His Web site also reiterates that stance. ""John McCain believes Roe vs. Wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned, and as president he will nominate judges who understand that courts should not be in the business of legislating from the bench,"" the Web site states. ""Constitutional balance would be restored by the reversal of Roe vs. Wade, returning the abortion question to the individual states.""
 
We find McCain's brief remark of support falls well short of a full-fledged change in position. His voting record on abortion appears to be solidly anti-abortion, though he differs with some anti-abortion advocacy groups on the issues of campaign finance reform and stem cell research, which he supports. On the Flip-O-Meter scale, we rate McCain's position on Roe v. Wade as a No Flip.

The RNC needs a good talking to
","
(Published Oct. 22, 2008)
 
Sometimes they make it easy on us fact-checkers.
 
Take the new flier from the Republican National Committee landing in mailboxes in the hard-fought state of Virginia.
 
""Terrorists don't care who they hurt,"" it says on the front, with a photograph of an airliner looming over silhouetted figures in an airport concourse.
 
""Why should we care what they have to say?"" the text continues inside. ""Barack Obama thinks terrorists just need a good talking to.""
 
The flier, which first appeared in mid October, goes on to recount how Obama said he would meet with leaders of hostile nations, and concludes with an ominous warning: ""Barack Obama. Not who you think he is.""
 
We'll review past statements from Obama to see whether he really believes terrorists ""just need a good talking to,"" starting with more context from a comment the RNC cites as evidence for its claim.
 
It's from the CNN/YouTube debate among the Democratic presidential contenders on July 23, 2007. A questioner asked whether the candidates would meet with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea.
 
""I would,"" Obama replied. ""And the reason is this, that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them — which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration — is ridiculous.
 
""Now, Ronald Reagan and Democratic presidents like JFK constantly spoke to the Soviet Union at a time when Ronald Reagan called them an evil empire. And the reason is because they understood that we may not trust them and they may pose an extraordinary danger to this country, but we had the obligation to find areas where we can potentially move forward.""
 
To state the obvious, it's not fair to extrapolate from that comment the sentiment that ""terrorists just need a good talking to.""
 
Iran, Cuba and Syria are indeed designated ""state sponsors of terrorism"" by the U.S. State Department. But diplomacy with their leaders does not preclude confronting the countries in other ways, any more than summits with Soviet leaders kept Cold War-era presidents from engaging in the nuclear-arms race or competing with communism in Southeast Asia, Afghanistan and South America.
 
On many occasions before and after that debate, Obama has spelled out that his diplomacy would not replace military options.
 
""Tough-minded diplomacy, backed by

the whole range of instruments of American power — political, economic, and military

 — could bring success even when dealing with long-standing adversaries such as Iran and Syria,"" he wrote in an article that appeared in the July/August 2007 edition of

Foreign Affairs

(emphasis added).
 
And just because Obama favors diplomacy with certain nations that sponsor terrorism does not mean he would talk to all terrorists, as the claim implies. In fact, Obama has consistently argued for beefing up the U.S. military effort against the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and does not propose diplomacy with those groups.
 
He said at a rally in Iowa on July 14, 2007, that America must ""take the fight more effectively to the enemy's home by destroying al-Qaida's leadership along the Afghan-Pakistan border.""
 
Obama has arguably outhawked Sen. John McCain on that subject. McCain said in the second presidential debate that it was inappropriate for Obama to talk about launching cross-border raids into Pakistan because such talk ""turns public opinion against us.""
 
""If we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out,"" Obama countered in that Oct. 7, 2008 debate. ""We will kill bin Laden; we will crush al-Qaida.""
 
That's more than just a ""good talking to."" Examples abound of Obama pledging to take on terrorists militarily. This claim is beyond false. It's Pants on Fire wrong.

Almost a Phanatic
","
In one of most biting attacks this political season, Sen. John McCain accused Sen. Barack Obama of pandering to his audience by flip-flopping on his rooting interest in the World Series. 
On Oct. 21, 2008, in Bensalem, Pa., solid Philadelphia Phillies territory, McCain told a small audience, ""Now, I’m not dumb enough to get mixed up in a World Series between swing states. But I think I may have detected a little pattern with Sen. Obama. It’s pretty simple really. When he’s campaigning in Philadelphia, he roots for the Phillies, and when he’s campaigning in Tampa Bay, he ‘shows love’ to the Rays."" 
There’s nothing so ugly as a flip-flopper on sports team loyalties. So we better get to the bottom of this. 
Here’s the facts: 
Obama in Dunedin, Fla., on Sept. 24, prior to the postseason: ""Congrats for the Rays. But I’m a White Sox fan, and we’ll see you in the playoffs."" 
Obama in Philadelphia, on Oct. 11, after the upstart Rays took out his White Sox in the first round of the American League playoffs: ""I am a White Sox fan. But since the White Sox are out of it, I’ll root for the Phillies now."" 
Obama in Tampa, Fla., on Oct. 20. Fresh off their ALCS win over the Boston Red Sox, a small group of the Rays attend Obama's rally and rookie pitcher David Price introduced the nominee. Said Obama: ""I’ve said from the beginning that I am a unity candidate, bringing people together. So when you see a White Sox fan showing love to the Rays — and the Rays showing some love back — you know we are on to something right here."" 
Obama also joked that he had considered getting a mohawk as a show of solidarity with the Rays (that’s what hard-core Rays fans do these days). ""But my political advisers said they weren’t sure how that would play with swing voters,"" Obama said. 
In the days before the Internet, it may have been possible to get away with pandering to sports enthusiasts in competing towns. No longer. Bloggers quickly pounced when Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin told a New Hampshire audience that ""Red Sox fans know how to turn an underdog into a victor."" The previous week, Palin sought to connect with a Tampa Bay crowd using nearly the same line. ""How about those Tampa Bay Rays?"" Palin said. ""You know what that tells me? It tells me that the people in this area know a little something about turning an underdog into a victor."" Insert groan here. 
But Obama’s the one on the hot seat here. At no time has Obama wavered in his primary allegiance to the White Sox. Any movement on that front would be inexcusable. But his team is gone, and now whom is he pulling for? 
A statement released by Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor, quoted on a  New York Times  politics blog, sought to make things clear. ""Senator Obama said he’s rooting for the Phillies. Yesterday he said nice things about the members of the team who came out to support him, but that doesn’t change the fact that Tampa Bay bounced his White Sox out of the playoffs."" 
In the complex hierarchy of determining fan loyalty, we are left to weigh whether ""showing love"" for the Rays equates to ""rooting for"" the Phillies. No, these aren't equivalent. But if you're rooting for the Phillies, you sure don't show love for the Rays at a Tampa rally. 
Is it shameless pandering? Of course. But is it a flip-flop? Not quite. We call it Half Flip.",[<zip object at 0x000002809724BC80>],/factchecks/2008/oct/21/barack-obama/almost-a-phanatic/

No Cabinet picks yet
","
At a rally in Bensalem, Pa., John McCain accused Barack Obama of getting cocky.
 
""We have 14 days to go. We're a few points down. The national media has written us off . . . Just the other day, Sen. Obama's campaign announced that he's choosing his Cabinet,"" McCain said at the Oct. 21, 2008, event.
 
The remark invokes a theme from the McCain campaign that Obama has gotten overly confident. McCain and his surrogates have criticized (and sometimes ridiculed) the Obama campaign's use of an emblem that resembled the presidential seal on a lectern, and the campaign's use of large Greek columns as a backdrop for Obama's stadium speech to the Democratic National Convention.
 
Rather than ""a few points down,"" the

latest Gallup poll

showed McCain trailing by 10 points nationally;

the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll

had him down by 9 points. It's a matter of opinion whether the media ""has written us off."" There have been many news stories about how McCain has fallen behind, but most that we've seen have not said definitively that he will lose.
 
For this item, we are exploring whether McCain was correct when he said that Obama ""has announced that he's choosing his Cabinet."" We have seen no such comment by the Obama campaign, nor could the McCain campaign provide one.
 
Instead, the McCain campaign pointed to an Oct. 19 article in the

Sunday Times of London

that was headlined ""

Barack Obama lines up a cabinet of stars as John McCain struggles on

."" The headline seems to indicate Obama is far along in his Cabinet-picking.
 
But the story doesn't live up to the headline. The story is just another speculative account of what Obama might do if he is elected: ""A host of well-known figures . . . have indicated they would be willing to serve in some capacity,"" the article says.
 
It relies not on any ""announcement"" from Obama, but on unnamed sources such as ""an Obama adviser"" and ""one leading Democrat policy adviser.""
 
The closest the article comes to an announcement from Obama himself is to quote his comment from the final debate that he would adopt a bipartisan approach to government and admired Republican Sen. Richard Lugar and Gen. Jim Jones, the former NATO commander.  “Those are the people, Democrat and Republican, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House,” Obama said.
 
But that's a long way from ""announcing"" that he was picking his Cabinet. In fact, it came in response to a question.
 
The McCain comment is particularly silly because it's been widely reported that

both

campaigns have staffers planning a transition and exploring possible Cabinet choices. McCain's transition team is said to be headed by John F. Lehman Jr., a Navy secretary under President Reagan. William E. Timmons, a longtime Washington lobbyist, is also involved, according to an account in the

New York Times

. Obama's team is headed by John Podesta, a chief of staff under President Clinton.
 
The Obama campaign declined to comment on transition plans and the McCain campaign did not reply to an e-mail about it. News accounts suggest that Obama's team is further along than McCain's but that both campaigns have begun preparations so they are ready in case they win.
 
Clay Johnson III, deputy director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told the

New York Times

that “the White House staff has met with transition representatives” for McCain and Obama.
 
“Both campaigns are doing what they need to do to be prepared to govern on Jan. 20 at noon,” said Johnson, who was executive director of the Bush transition team in 2000-01. “The amount of work being done before the election, formal and informal, is the most ever.”
 
But back to McCain's claim. Has Obama ""announced that he's choosing his Cabinet""? He definitely has not. What's happening is the usual transition planning that occurs with any presidential campaign in the final days before an election. We find McCain's claim to be False.

Closer to 40 percent than 50 percent
","
In an interview with Fox News, John McCain was asked about Barack Obama's claim that 95 percent of Americans will not see their taxes go up under Obama's proposals.
 
 ""You spent a lot of time in your debate dealing with that. Is that honest? Is that truthful?"" commentator Sean Hannity asked in the Oct. 12, 2008, interview.
 
""Well, first of all, it's not truthful in the respect that 50 percent or 40 percent of the American people — of taxpayers — American citizens don't pay taxes, federal income taxes,"" McCain said.
 
McCain's statement is phrased a little awkwardly, but the context of the conversation makes it clear that he's talking about the number of tax filers who don't owe any income tax thanks to credits and deductions.
 
In their conversation, Hannity and McCain also say that Obama has promised a tax cut for 95 percent of ""Americans,"" which would be all tax filers. But Obama's policies do not provide a tax cut for 95 percent of

Americans 

— it's actually about 81 percent of all American tax filers.
 
Sometimes, though, Obama is more careful in his statements and claims that his tax put will give 95 percent of ""working families"" a tax cut. This percentage for workers holds up pretty well even if you do not consider people who don't owe taxes. For more on why that is,

read our story here

.
 
For this ruling, however, we wanted to focus on how many people don't pay federal taxes because they qualify for enough credits or deductions that they don't owe any taxes. Common credits include the earned income tax credit for low-wage workers, the child tax credit, education credits, and credits for child care expenses. Common deductions include medical and dental expenses, mortgage interest, charitable contributions, educational expenses and business expenses.
 
Many credits are refundable, which means the government sends a check if the taxes owed are less than zero. Deductions generally reduce taxes owed to zero, with no check sent if the tax bill is less than zero.
 
We consulted the nonpartisan experts at the Tax Policy Center. They said that the percent of taxpayers with zero or negative individual income tax liability will be 38 percent in 2009.
 
That's pretty close to 40 percent, the low end of the range McCain said. If McCain had said it was 40 percent, we would have ruled that his statement was True, because he would only be two points off. But he also said it could be around 50 percent, and that seems like pushing the envelope a tad too far. So we rate his statement Mostly True.

He represented them in one case
","
John McCain's campaign and the Republican National Committee have launched efforts to connect Barack Obama and the community organizing group ACORN.
 
ACORN was founded in 1970; its acronym stands for Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. ACORN's agenda includes left-leaning causes such as voter registration drives for low-income groups, initiatives to increase the minimum wage and programs offering help to victims of predatory lending.
 
By all indications, ACORN operates within the American political mainstream, though clearly it favors the left side of the ideological spectrum. Its voter registration efforts tend to focus on the low-income, minorities and youth, all traditional Democratic constituencies. Obama received an endorsement from the group's political action committee in February 2008 when the Democratic primaries were in full swing. But that's not to say Republicans never support ACORN's efforts: McCain himself appeared at a 2006 rally in favor of immigration reform, sponsored in part by ACORN.
 
The primary allegation against ACORN is that its voter registration drives result in many phony registrations. ACORN itself admits that some of its workers, in their attempts to meet registration goals, have turned in registration forms for people who do not exist or don't live in the geographic area. (Notorious examples include Mickey Mouse and the starting lineup of the Dallas Cowboys.) ACORN says the problems are isolated, and that it works with officials to correct them. They claim to have registered 1.3-million people to vote, so a small number of irregularities are to be expected. (For more on ACORN and the controversy surrounding its voter registration drives,

read the St. Petersburg Times story here

.) Several states are investigating the group's voter registration efforts.
 
The McCain campaign issued numerous charges about Obama's connection to ACORN in an Oct. 10, 2008, memo. For other charges, read our full story. Here, we'll look at the allegation that Obama was ""a trial attorney for ACORN.""
 
Obama graduated from law school in 1991, worked on the book that would become his memoir

Dreams from my Father

, and directed a voter registration drive in 1992. After that, Obama went to work for a civil rights law firm then named Davis, Miner, Barnhill and Galland. (It is now known only as Miner, Barnhill and Galland.) The firm's specialty is civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development work. 
 
Obama and two other attorneys represented ACORN along with other plaintiffs in a 1995 federal civil lawsuit against the state of Illinois — Gov. James Edgar and other state officials were the named plaintiffs — to demand that it enforce a new federal law known as ""motor voter,"" which allowed people to register to vote when they got their driver's license. Among the groups who sided with ACORN in the matter: the U.S. Department of Justice and the League of Women Voters. The courts concluded that Illinois had to enforce the law, and the case generated several federal court orders through 1995 and 1996.
 
Obama was making his first successful run for the Illinois state Senate in 1996; he would hold that office until he ran for U.S. Senate in 2004. Obama remained affiliated with the law firm while he served in the state legislature, but news reports say his actual legal work for the firm declined significantly as he focused on his elected office.
 
So if McCain campaign's statement means that Obama represented ACORN, this is true. But the statement implies that Obama worked for ACORN as a staff attorney, or in a longer-term relationship. Yet he really only represented them once. So we find McCain's statement Half True.

The truth fades into the background
","
A chain e-mail has been burning up the Internet with the allegation that Sen. Barack Obama is not eligible for FBI or Secret Service jobs because of his acquaintance with former antiwar radical William Ayers.
 
The implication is that anyone who wouldn't qualify for a federal law enforcement job has no business as commander in chief of the U.S. armed forces.
 
One version of the e-mail we received on Oct. 10, 2008, had the subject heading, ""FW: unbelievable food for thought.""
 
""Just passing along info that came to me,"" it began. ""This is something to think about no matter what other concerns may be on your plate. If Barack Obama would apply for a job with the FBI or with the Secret Service, he would be disqualified because of his past associations with William Ayers, a known (and unrepentant) terrorist. If elected President, he would not qualify to be his own body guard!""
 
It's worth noting that the president, no matter who he or she may be, automatically gets access to any classified information, and in fact has the authority to decide who else in the government gets access to it. Just by virtue of having been elected to the U.S. Senate, Obama already has access to a great deal of secret intelligence information.
 
Still, that says little about how Obama would fare in a background check, since none is required for either job.
 
An FBI spokesman said the bureau would not comment on whether any individual would pass a background check, and the Secret Service did not return numerous calls on the matter. So we asked outside experts whether Ayers would pose a problem for Obama.




 
Ayers was a founder in 1969 of the violent antiwar group the Weathermen, which took responsibility for at least 12 bombings between 1970 and 1974. A pipe bomb attributed to the group killed a police officer and severely injured another in 1970, and three of the group's own members were killed in a 1970 explosion in a Greenwich Village townhouse in which they were making bombs. Ayers was investigated in connection with the group's activities, but the charges were dropped in 1974 due to prosecutorial misconduct. He emerged from hiding, earned a doctorate in education from Columbia University, and is now a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Like Obama, he lives on the South Side of Chicago.
 
Obama and Ayers are both active in politics and civic life in the city. They both volunteered at two different charities, the Woods Foundation and the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, and Ayers hosted a small gathering for Obama and then-state Sen. Alice Palmer in 1995 as Obama planned to run for the seat Palmer was vacating.
 
Were Obama to apply to the FBI, he would have to fill out Standard Form 86, a background-investigation form used by the entire U.S. intelligence community. The more detailed iterations of the Internet rumor allege Obama would have to disclose his past connections to Ayers on the form, particularly in a section titled ""Association Record."" It asks seven questions along the lines of these two:
 
""Have you EVER been an officer or a member of, or made a contribution to, an organization dedicated to the use of violence or force to overthrow the U.S. Government...?""
 
The Secret Service did not return our calls for comment about the agency's application procedures, but its Web site indicates that applicants must fill out a modified version of the form called the SF-86A, which asks: ""Are you now or have you ever been a member of any foreign or domestic organization, association, movement, group, or combination of persons which is totalitarian, fascist, communist, or subversive; or which has adopted or shows a policy advocating or approving the commission of force or violence to deny other persons their rights under the Constitution of the United States, or which seems [sic] to alter the form of government of the United States by unconstitutional means?""
 
Note that the agencies ask whether the applicant himself has engaged in this behavior – not whether the applicant knows anyone who has. Ayers' militant activity occurred in the '60s and '70s, when Obama was a child. Even Obama's harshest critics do not allege he had anything to do with them.
 
So there is no reason to believe Obama would have to disclose his relationship to Ayers, experts said.
 
""There is nowhere on the form that Obama's relationship to Ayers as it exists or existed would even come up,"" said Mark Zaid, a Washington attorney who specializes in security-clearance work. ""It would never come up unless somebody mentioned it during a background investigation.""
 
Moreover, even if it did come up, there's no reason to believe it would impede Obama's hiring, Zaid said. ""Given what has been said publicly about their relationship, I can't fathom that it would ever get more than a moment's attention,"" he said.
 
A second lawyer specializing in security clearances, Elizabeth Newman of the Washington, D.C., firm Kalijarvi, Chuzi & Newman, concurred that the Ayers connection would pose no problem for Obama, even if it did come to the attention of the investigators.
 
""They would care if there was a recent relationship with someone who is currently on trial or currently considered to be advocating violent overthrow of the government,"" she said. ""But not something that was 20 or 30 years ago.""
 
A third security-clearance lawyer, Mark Riley of Odenton, Md., who is also a retired Army intelligence officer, was slightly less dismissive of the Ayers issue, saying it was ""something they would investigate.""
 
But Riley leaned toward the conclusion that the Ayers connection would not cost Obama a security clearance. ""The issue is what is Obama's relationship with him in his adult life,"" Riley said. ""If he didn't have one, other than they sat on a board and maybe had the same political causes, that's not enough to deny a fellow a clearance.""
 
So all three of the attorneys we contacted agreed unequivocally that Obama's relationship with Ayers would not be an automatic disqualifier, as the claim suggests.
 
In fact, Zaid said someone with Obama's record – a law degree from Harvard, teaching experience at the University of Chicago Law School – would be an excellent candidate.
 
""The agencies would be fighting over him,"" Zaid said. ""As an outright claim, this statement is false.""
 
We agree. It's False.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Barack Obama']","
That's a fair estimate
","
In the final presidential debate Oct. 15, 2008, moderator Bob Schieffer of CBS News asked each candidate for specifics about programs they would cut in order to balance the federal budget.
 
""We spend $15-billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies,"" Sen. Barack Obama said. ""It doesn’t – under the Medicare plan – it doesn’t help seniors get any better. It’s not improving our health care system. It’s just a giveaway.""
 
Obama used the same example when asked a similar question in the first debate.
 
""We right now give $15-billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system,"" Obama said. ""Doesn’t work any better through the private insurers. They just skim off $15-billion. That was a giveaway and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works.""
 
Obama is talking about the Medicare Advantage (MA) program, which pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare beneficiaries who sign up. It was conceived as a cost containment measure on the theory that competition between HMOs, PPOs and other private plans would drive down costs. In fact, MA plans have consistently cost the government more per beneficiary than traditional fee-for-service Medicare costs. About 18 percent of beneficiaries now belong to MA plans.
 
The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent Congressional agency, estimated that in 2008, the MA program cost 13 percent more than traditional Medicare. A Commonwealth Fund report estimates that that translates, on average, to nearly $1,000 more for each person in the MA program, for a national total of more than $8.5-billion last year (and a total $33-billion from 2004 to 2008).
 
Insurance companies argue that people enrolled MA programs get better service.
 
""One of the important things to keep in mind is that Medicare Advantage provides additional benefits and services not available in traditional fee-for-service programs,"" said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans.
 
Zirkelbach argues that the plan offers better hearing, vision and dental coverage and a disease management plan. MA plans have also proven useful in some rural areas that are short on health care providers. Some plans refund all, or part, of their clients' Part B Medicare premium, which can save people hundreds of dollars a year.
 
The tradeoff is that beneficiaries are often limited to using hospitals and doctors in the plans' network. While beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs are often less under MA plans, that is not always the case. Some services, like nursing home rehabilitation, can be more expensive than under traditional Medicare.
 
Brian Biles, a professor in the Department of Health Policy at George Washington University and a former senior vice president of the Commonwealth Fund, said  that while MA participants may get about 13 percent more value from extra benefits in the MA plan, it costs about 13 percent more. So it isn't necessarily any more efficient than traditional Medicare, just more costly, Biles argues.
 
""Why should some people get an extra $1,000 in Medicare coverage and some not?"" Biles said.
 
In testimony before the House of Representatives on June 28, 2007, CBO director Peter R. Orszag said Medicare is, in effect, subsidizing the added cost of the Medicare Advantage program.
 
But is it better? Orszag wasn’t convinced. ""Many Medicare Advantage plans offer disease management, care coordination, and preventive care programs, but little information is available on the degree to which the plans generate better health outcomes than the traditional Medicare program,"" he said.
 
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the government refused to pay MA plans more than traditional Medicare costs, that the taxpayers would save $9.5-billion in 2009, $54-billion over the 2009-2012 period, and $150-billion over 10 years. It was that last projection that Obama apparently used to come up with his $15-billion figure.
 
Joseph Antos, a health policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, believes that if the additional money paid for MA plans is eliminated or severely reduced, ""half the plans will drop out in two years.""
 
That won’t sit well with people in those plans, he said, and it’s likely to be strongly opposed by congressmen from rural districts – Republicans and Democrats alike – who have a high percentage of constituents in the MA program.
 
Antos also takes issue with Obama’s characterization of the extra money paid for MA as giveaways to insurance companies.
 
""In general, the extra money that goes to these plans ends up benefiting the beneficiaries to some extent,"" Anton said.
 
The programs tend to have a lower co-payment for prescription drugs and premiums for medical services.
 
""Does some of that stick to their (insurance company) fingers, of course,"" Antos said.
 
It's Obama's interpretation when he calls the added payments for MA programs insurance company ""subsidies"" or ""giveaways."" But Obama is on solid ground when he estimates that the government spends about $15-billion a year extra on the private MA program than on traditional Medicare, particularly as we move forward in coming years. And so we rate his statement True.

Project Vote not ""an arm of ACORN""

This year, Project Vote and ACORN worked together on a nationwide voter registration drive aimed at low-income, minority and youth voters. They have worked together on other initiatives with left-leaning groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Organization for Women. But Project Vote and ACORN are separate organizations with different histories.
 
ACORN was founded in 1970 in Little Rock, Ark., as an outgrowth of the National Welfare Rights Organization. Project Vote was launched more than a decade later in Washington, D.C.
 
Michael Slater, the current executive director of Project Vote, said the two organizations are separate. And in 1992, the two groups didn't really work together, he said. They began partnerships on voter registration after Project Vote went through a reorganization in 1994, according to Slater.
 
We also didn't find any evidence to indicate the two organizations had a relationship during the 1992 Illinois drive. A detailed article about Project Vote in

Chicago

magazine didn't mention ACORN. ACORN itself says Obama didn't work for them during that time.
 
The 1992 voter registration drive came at an early point in Obama's political career. He had graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991. He had returned to Chicago, where he spent his early 20s working as a community organizer, and was working on the book that would become his memoir

Dreams From my Father

. Obama started directing the Project Vote voter registration drive in April 1992, and ran it the rest of the year until Election Day. Bill Clinton carried Illinois that November, and Democrat Carol Moseley-Braun won one of the state's Senate seats, becoming the first African-American woman to serve as a U.S. senator.
 
People in Chicago seem to have credited at least a bit of those victories to Obama's registration drive, which reportedly brought 150,000 new voters to the rolls.

Chicago

magazine called his initiative ""one of the most important local stories"" of the campaign season.

Crain's Chicago Business

named him to its annual ""40 under 40"" list and wrote that he had ""galvanized Chicago's political community, as no seasoned politico had before."" 
 
Is it possible that ACORN and Project Vote were going about the same business in Illinois in 1992? Sure. Both groups have the stated goal of getting people to register to vote, especially low-income, minority and young voters.
 
But we find no evidence that Obama's 1992 work was for ACORN. We rate McCain's claim False.

Centerpiece? More like a side dish
","
Sen. Barack Obama mocked his rival's education policy during the final presidential debate, saying Sen. John McCain planned to help a couple thousand students in Washington, D.C., and more or less ignore the rest of the country.
 
His attack came late in the debate, as the candidates sparred over how to improve schools.
 
Here's the exchange in context:
 
""I'm sure you're aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided,"" McCain said in the Oct. 15, 2008, debate. ""There's a certain number, I think it's a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that...They wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children...That was vouchers, Senator Obama. And I'm frankly surprised you didn't pay more attention to that example.""
 
Obama countered: ""Even if Senator McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go — I disagree with him on this, because the data doesn't show that it actually solves the problem — the centerpiece of Senator McCain's education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots. That leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from Senator McCain.""
 
The senators were referring to the four-year-old D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, under which 1,903 children from low-income families have received up to $7,500 a year for tuition to private schools. Republicans in Congress – who believe in improving public schools through competition by providing vouchers parents can use to pay for private-school tuition – created the program in 2004.
 
It's true that McCain is a strong advocate of the D.C. program. On his campaign Web site, he

lists

13 items under the heading, ""John McCain's Education Policy,"" including: ""John McCain Will Expand The D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program.""
 
He devotes 87 words to the subject, while the average item receives 67 words.
 
""In our nation's capital, we have seen the dramatic benefits of giving parents control of money and choices,"" the site says. ""The Opportunity Scholarship program serves more than 1,900 students from families with an average income of $23,000 a year. More than 7,000 more families have applied for that program. The budget for the Opportunity Scholarships is currently $13 million. John McCain believes that this extremely successful program should expand to at least $20 million benefiting nearly a thousand more families.""
 
Obama actually overstated the number of slots McCain would add to the program. But more importantly, there's no indication that plan is the ""centerpiece"" of McCain's education policy.
 
True, there are just two items to which McCain's education page devotes more words.
 
But three of the items outline different ways McCain would, as the site puts it, ""Ensure that our children have quality teachers,"" an effort that would be national in scope. He would devote 5 percent of certain federal funds (Title II funds) to recruit teachers who graduated in the top quarter of their class, set aside 60 percent of those funds as bonuses for high-performing teachers, and use 35 percent of the funds for teacher development.
 
It was clear to us that McCain's plan to use — or continue using — Title II funds to improve teaching is the centerpiece of his education policy, even before McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said this in an e-mail: ""The focus of our plan is the reform of...Title 1 and 2 funding – which is in excess of 16 billion dollars...Moreover, we have higher ed and early ed policy which have nothing to do with the DC opportunity scholarship expansion.""
 
We agree. On this one, Obama gets an F for False.

Most small businesses won't be subject to Obama's tax increases
","
During the final presidential debate in Hempstead, N.Y., Barack Obama and John McCain got into an argument about Joe the Plumber.
 
McCain said Joe would get a bigger tax bill under the Obama tax plan. Obama defended himself by saying that ""98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000"" and would not see a tax increase under the Obama plan.
 
Joe the Plumber is an actual person: Joe Wurzelbacher, who met Obama during a campaign stop a few days before the debate in Toledo, Ohio.
 
""I'm getting ready to buy a company that makes about $250,000, $270,000, $280,000 a year,"" he told Obama. ""Your new tax plan is going to tax me more, isn't it?""
 
Obama said yes, it would --see

their entire conversation on YouTube

-- but Obama defended his tax policy as being good for people who are struggling.
 
""It's not that I want to punish your success. I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you, that they've got a chance at success, too,"" Obama said.
 
During the debate, John McCain mentioned Joe the Plumber at least a dozen times as the kind of small business owner who would pay more taxes under Obama's plans.
 
It's not clear from the exchange just what Joe means when he says the business ""makes"" up to $280,000 a year. Is he talking about total revenue? Profits? That's an important point here and it's one that Obama and Joe the Plumber never discussed. Based on Obama's proposals and current tax policy, for Joe's taxes to rise Joe would have to ""make"" $250,000 in net profit, after deducting all his expenses: his employees' pay, his supplies, his truck, his fuel costs, and other legitimate business expenses. He'd have to be an extremely successful plumber.
 
In response to McCain's statements during the debate, Obama said only 2 percent of small businesses would be subject to the tax.
 
It seems likely that Obama is right, according to data and an analysis from the experts at the Tax Policy Center.
 
Obama's plan is to roll back the Bush tax cuts on the top two tax brackets. In practice, this means that people with income above $200,000 for single people and $250,000 for couples would see taxes increase.
 
Now what does this mean for small businesses? It's not as easy as you might think to identify small businesses via the tax code. But there are several typical ways that small business owners pay their taxes, usually by declaring business income on their individual tax returns. Many people who declare business income are small businesses, though the group also includes professionals like lawyers, authors, or public speakers.
 
Looking at all the tax filers who report any business income at all, the Tax Policy Center confirms that about 2 percent will see their taxes increase under Obama's plan.
 
In an effort to focus more effectively on small business owners, the Tax Policy Center did an additional analysis where they looked at people who reported business income that accounted for at least 50 percent of their income. This means people who derive a significant living off their business income.
 
In 2007, about 2 percent of those tax filers would have made enough money to see a tax increase under Obama's plans.
 
There is a small bit of uncertainty in the best data available; it includes some people who we would not think of as traditional small business owners. But still, Obama's statement during the debate that ""98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000"" matches the findings of a respected, non-partisan group of tax analysts. For that reason, we rate Obama's statement True.

McCain's aim still off on tax votes
","
Sen. John McCain revived a claim against Barack Obama that Obama voted to raise taxes on people making $42,000 a year.
 
“He voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $42,000 a year,” McCain said in the presidential debate Oct. 15, 2008, at Hofstra University.
 
This time, McCain correctly noted the tax votes came on budget resolutions. But we’ve reviewed this charge before and found that McCain was stretching the truth. He does again this time, though not as badly.
 
Obama voted in March 2008 and June 2008 for budget resolutions. They are blueprints for the federal budget. The resolutions set targets for the committees that write legislation on taxes and spending. The resolutions, approved on mostly party-line votes, expressed support for rolling back tax cuts enacted under President Bush for people making $42,000 a year and higher.
 
So the McCain campaign is correct that Obama voted for the measures, which expressed approval for tax increases.
 
But it’s inaccurate to suggest that votes on nonbinding budget resolutions, which don’t have the force of law and don’t include precise details on taxes or spending, are the same as votes on legislation that actually increases taxes. The resolutions would not change the tax code.
 
Moreover, Obama as a candidate has proposed tax increases for couples earning $250,000 or more a year, or singles earning $200,000 or more.
 
We rated previous versions of McCain’s charge as Barely True. Although McCain added context to his charge, it doesn’t change the fact that the votes were never expected to raise taxes. So we rate the latest version of McCain’s statement Half True.

Obama's been critical of NAFTA
","
During a discussion of climate change and energy imports during the third presidential debate, Sen. John McCain detoured briefly to Canada.
 
McCain attacked Sen. Barack Obama's position on the North American Free Trade Agreement. Here's his claim in context:

           

 
""I think we can, for all intents and purposes, eliminate our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and Venezuelan oil. Canadian oil is fine,"" McCain said during the Oct. 15, 2008, debate. ""By the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, 'Yes, and we'll sell our oil to China.' You don't tell countries you're going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.""
 
What we take McCain's claim to mean is that Obama said he would renegotiate NAFTA whether or not Canada and Mexico – the other signatories to the trade agreement – want to do so, or renegotiate in such a way as to impose additional burdens on them but not on the United States.
 
It's true that Obama has been harshly critical of NAFTA on the campaign trail, citing shortfalls in its protections for workers and the environment. He has used words like ""devastating"" and ""a big mistake"" to describe the agreement.
 
Obama was particularly critical of NAFTA in February in the run-up to the Ohio Democratic primary. In a debate, he said, ""We should

use the hammer of a potential opt-out as leverage to ensure that we actually get labor and environmental standards that are enforced.""

 
In a June 20, 2008 conference call with reporters, Obama surrogate Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat, said he was ""absolutely confident Barack Obama

will reopen the negotiations on


NAFTA.


I have been assured by him and his top economic advisers there is no question his position is constant and will stay that way on the North American Free Trade Agreement.""

 

But would Obama do so ""unilaterally""? In a June interview with


Fortune

magazine, he indicated he would not.
 

""I'm not a big believer in doing things unilaterally,"" he told the magazine of his plans on NAFTA. ""I'm a big believer in opening up a dialogue and figuring out how we can make this work for all people.""

 

It's difficult to reconcile these two stands. There's little indication


Canada


wants to renegotiate the agreement, so it's not clear how Obama would do so without initiating the negotiation ""unilaterally.""

 

Perhaps it was a bit misleading for McCain to highlight Obama's harsher rhetoric on NAFTA instead of his softer stance. But only a bit – the fact is, Obama has often spoken of NAFTA in such a way that a fair listener would conclude he would press to renegotiate it regardless of how the other parties feel.

 

Characterizing that as a ""unilateral"" renegotiation, though not the clearest language in the world, was a pretty fair shorthand for McCain to use. We find his claim Mostly True.
