State Sen. Nina Turner says 99 state workers lost jobs the day after Kasich unveiled his 'jobs budget'
","
Ohio law requires the state to keep its budget in balance. But it's up to the governor and the General Assembly to figure out how to do it and how the burdens of the balancing act should be shared.

Gov. John Kasich took the lead in that process with what he called the ""jobs budget,"" a spending blueprint that includes cuts to local governments and school districts and to state agencies to close an $800 billion budget shortfall.

Kasich unveiled his spending plan March 15, 2011.

At a public forum at the Idea Center at Playhouse Square, State Sen. Nina Turner said she feared the governor was ""balancing the budget on the backs of employees"" and would impair the government's ability to provide services.

When ""the governor announced his 'jobs budget,' 99 folks from the Department of Taxation were let go the next day,"" she said.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to check it out.

On March 16, the state said it will close seven regional Taxpayer Service Centers on June 30 -- the end of the fiscal year -- resulting in the loss of nearly 100 jobs.

Tax Commissioner Joe Testa sent e-mail notices to employees at regional Taxpayer Service Centers in Akron, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dayton, Toledo, Youngstown and Zanesville. The Columbus center will remain open.

Workers in the Cleveland office told The Plain Dealer the closings are a mistake that will hurt taxpayers and hurt tax revenue.

But the tax department said the revenues are about half of the $7 million the state will save. Testa said the offices have only a fraction of the calls and walk-in traffic they once did.

We asked the governor's office about the job cuts.

""It's in the context of what we want to do with the budget as a whole,"" spokesman Rob Nichols said. ""We inherited an $8 billion budget hole. We had the seventh-highest taxes in the nation last year.""

The closing of the service centers is in line with a promise the governor made during his campaign: to shrink state government and make it more efficient.

""This budget presents a spending blueprint that Ohio taxpayers can finally afford,"" Nichols said. ""We can't keep doing what we're doing and expect to succeed in this state.""

Whether closing the tax service centers and laying off workers is a good idea is a question for someone else to answer. But Kasich is doing it.

That rates Turner’s statement as True on the Truth-O-Meter.",/factchecks/2011/may/11/nina-turner/state-sen-nina-turner-says-99-state-workers-lost-j/

Executive director of marriage group says most Rhode Islanders oppose gay marriage.
","
Opponents and proponents of same-sex marriage are retooling after Rhode Island House Speaker Gordon Fox announced April 27 that there was not enough support to pass same-sex marriage legislation in 2011.

A few days after that announcement, Christopher Plante, executive director of National Organization for Marriage - Rhode Island, which opposes gay marriage, was part of a panel on WPRI's ""Newsmakers"" program, which aired May 1.

""I don't believe Gordon Fox had the votes. Our head count showed pretty clearly that they didn't have the votes and he had to make the decision he did,"" he said. ""Similarly, the people of Rhode Island don't want same-sex marriage.""

NOM-RI has been quick to cite the polls it has commissioned as part of its campaign to press the governor and General Assembly to put the question of gay marriage to a statewide referendum. So we wondered whether any polls show that Rhode Islanders, in fact, don't want same-sex marriage.

We called Plante to see if he had any updated numbers. He didn't. He said he was basing his assertion on the belief that a majority of residents had contacted their legislators to object to same-sex marriage, which is why Fox said there weren't enough votes in the House to pass a bill.

People who call their legislators don't necessarily reflect the opinion of the general public, just as legislators don't always vote with the majority of their constituents. (In this case, House spokesman Larry Berman told us that the calls coming in to Fox's office ""were fairly evenly divided between those in favor of same-sex marriage and those opposed."" )

Even opinion polls aren't perfectly reflective because they usually only survey likely voters. But opinion polls are the best indicator we have, so we reviewed recent polls that addressed the issue.

NOM-RI itself has done surveys in Rhode Island. In its most recent, in December 2009, respondents were asked: ""As far as you are concerned personally, do you favor or oppose same-sex marriage in Rhode Island? And do you feel strongly about this?

A majority of those with an opinion actually endorsed same-sex marriage -- 42.6 percent said they strongly or somewhat favored it.  Another 32.2 percent strongly or somewhat opposed it -- clearly not a majority, even among those who responded. Just under 23 percent were undecided and the rest had no opinion.

That was up from a poll the group conducted six months earlier, when support for gay marriage was 36 percent and opposition was pegged at 43 percent.

(In an example of how you can get a different answer if you word the question differently, NOM-RI turned the question on its head in both surveys by asking respondents whether they supported or opposed this statement: ""Only marriage between a man and a woman will be valid or recognized in Rhode Island.""

(In the December 2009 survey, 44.9 percent expressed support for the statement [and, by implication, opposition to gay marriage], 43.6 percent felt the other way, and 9.7 were undecided. But even that question showed a significant increase in support for gay marriage compared to the poll six months earlier, when 52 percent agreed with the anti-gay-marriage statement and 38 percent expressed opposition to it.)

Supporters of gay marriage have done their own polling.

In a July 2010 poll commissioned by Rhode Island Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (RI-GLAD), 59 percent of 502 likely voters said they strongly or somewhat favored ""allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry legally."" Thirty-one percent were somewhat or strongly opposed. In a 2008 RI_GLAD poll, 49 percent favored same-sex marriage; in 2006, 45 percent approved.

However, when we looked closer at the 2010 RI-GLAD survey, we found that it initially primed respondents by telling them in an earlier question that, ""Churches, clergy and other religious institutions would NOT be required to perform same-sex marriages."" That reassurance might have bumped up the approval rating.

The only independent Rhode Island poll we found was released by Brown University in May 2009, before the NOM-RI and RI-GLAD polls. Its survey of 593 registered voters found that 60 percent of registered Rhode Islanders expressed support when asked, ""Would you support or oppose a law that would allow same-sex couples to get married?"" Thirty one percent said they would oppose it. About half of the opposition was hard core - 17 percent said they would even oppose civil unions for gay couples.

We mentioned those results to Plante.

""Would I repeat that I believe the majority of Rhode Islanders don't want gay marriage? Yeah, I'll repeat that,"" he said when we spoke with him. ""Can I give you a definitive poll that shows that? No.""

But he also said that his claim is justified because House Speaker Fox couldn't get enough votes for gay marriage in his own chamber. That, he asserted, is because people were ""calling their representatives and saying 'We don't want this.' . . . I wasn't making a statistical claim.""

We disagree. Of course it’s a statistical claim. When you say ""the people of Rhode Island don't want same-sex marriage"" you're saying that more than 50 percent would oppose such legislation.

The most recent polls from Brown, RI-GLAD and even NOM-RI -- Plante’s organization -- show the opposite.

Not only did the trends in the NOM-RI and RI-GLAD polls show opposition to same-sex marriage evaporating, the Brown and RI-GLAD polls showed that the public wants gay couples to have the right to marry, even if you assume that every voter who didn't express an opinion was opposed to gay marriage.

Plante's assertion isn't just false. It's ridiculous. We rate it Pants On Fire!

"['Immigration', 'National', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama says border patrol has doubled the number of agents since 2004
","In a speech on immigration reform in El Paso, Texas, President Barack Obama boasted about an unprecedented number of border security agents along the U.S. border with Mexico, but he said critics probably still won't be satisfied.

""Under Secretary Napolitano’s leadership, we have strengthened border security beyond what many believed was possible,"" Obama said in his May 10, 2011, speech. ""They wanted more agents on the border. Well, we now have more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history. The Border Patrol has 20,000 agents –- more than twice as many as there were in 2004, a buildup that began under President Bush and that we have continued.""

Obama said that commitment is beyond what was requested by some Republicans ""who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement.""

""I suspect there will be those who will try to move the goal posts one more time,"" Obama said. ""They’ll say we need to triple the border patrol.  Or quadruple the border patrol.""

Obama has touted this statistic about border patrol agents in his immigration speeches before. In July 2010, we fact-checked the president's claim that ""Today, we have more boots on the ground near the southwest border than at any time in our history."" (the same phrase he used in El Paso). And last month, our colleagues at PolitiFact Georgia checked Obama's claim in a TV interview that ""We have now more Border Patrol officers … than we’ve had at any time in our history.""

We rated both of those claims Mostly True, noting that while border patrol manpower is at an all-time modern high, President Woodrow Wilson sent between 75,000 and 150,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border in 1916 to quell a surprise attack in the New Mexico town of Columbus by Pancho Villa, a military venture otherwise known as the Mexican Expedition of 1916.

Here, we decided to focus on Obama's claim that ""the Border Patrol has 20,000 agents -- more than twice as many as there were in 2004.""

There were 20,745 border patrol agents as of April 9, 2011; 17,659 of them stationed along the southwest border with Mexico, according to data provided by Steven Cribby, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security.

That's up from 17,499 border patrol agents at the end of September 2008, four months before Obama took office (an 18 percent increase).

Singling out just the border patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexico border, the number has increased from 15,422 to 17,659 (a 14 percent increase).

According to a March 3, 2010, analysis of border security by the Congressional Research Service, ""Border Patrol agent manpower assigned to the southwest border has been increasing steadily since the early 1990s. In 1992, there were 3,555 agents assigned to the southern border, by 2000 that number had increased by 141 percent to 8,580. Since 2000, the number of agents assigned to the southern border has continued to increase, more than doubling once more to 20,119 agents at the end of FY2009. The rapid and steady increase of Border Patrol agents assigned to the southern border reflects the ongoing interest in Congress in stemming the tide of illegal immigration.""

The report notes that Obama's proposed 2011 budget requested a reduction of 181 Border Patrol agents. But the administration's proposed 2012 budget calls for increasing the the number of border patrol agents to 21,370.

Jack Martin, special projects director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports stricter illegal immigration guidelines, said Obama's statistic is true but that much of the credit for starting the trend toward more border security goes to Obama's predecessor.

""There has been a steady buildup of BP officers for several years given impetus by the 9/11 attacks,"" Martin said. ""The increase has by necessity been gradual because it is limited by the capacity of the BP training facility.""  In March 2011, the U.S. Government Accountability Office released a report, ""Border Security: DHS Progress and Challenges in Securing the U.S. Southwest and Northern Borders,"" in conjunction with testimony from GAO Director Richard Stana.

The report confirmed that personnel and other resources to stop illegal crossings of the U.S.-Mexico border have increased dramatically in recent years. In 2004, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was created, reorganizing several federal agencies under a single roof. That year, the agency had 10,500 agents to patrol land borders.  That number now stands at nearly 21,000. In other words, manpower has roughly doubled since 2004, as Obama said in his speech in El Paso. Again, that trend began under President Bush, whom Obama credited, but it continued under Obama.

"['Medicare', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Sen. Marco Rubio says those who voted for federal health care law also voted to cut $500 billion from Medicare
","
On May 1, 2011, Sen. Marco Rubio appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press to discuss everything from his take on Donald Trump’s presidential aspirations to the crisis in Libya.

During the nearly 10-minute interview, Rubio was asked by host David Gregory for his thoughts on fellow Republican Rep. Paul Ryan’s proposal to overhaul the nation’s Medicare system. Ryan’s proposal calls for a voucher-type system -- where, starting in 2022, those 65 and older would chose from a private health insurance plan, but the government would contribute a certain amount toward their premiums. The House passed Ryan's budget plan, including his Medicare proposal, on April 15 by a vote of 235 to 193. 
""Would you vote for the Ryan plan?"" Gregory asked.

""I will support any plan that saves Medicare, doesn’t impact current seniors and doesn’t hurt economic growth. The Ryan plan does that,"" Rubio responded.

The freshman senator then went on to say: ""The Ryan plan doesn’t cut Medicare. Actually, it increases funding in it. And the only people in this town that have voted to cut Medicare are the people that supported Obamacare, that cut half a trillion dollars over the next 10 years out of Medicare and is using it to fund a health care experiment somewhere outside of Medicare.""

Medicare cuts are an issue PolitiFact has covered extensively on the national level and in other states. So we wondered, once again, how accurate Rubio was in stating that those who voted for the federal health care law, in essence, voted to cut Medicare?

Medicare

First some background on how the Medicare system was affected by the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act.

Under the act, Congress voted to reduce $500 billion in projected Medicare spending over the next 10 years, not in one substantial chunk. The reductions are aimed at eliminating parts of the Medicare program seen as ineffective or wasteful. For example, the plan phases out payments to the Medicare Advantage program, an optional program set up under the George W. Bush administration, where seniors could opt to enroll in a private insurance program and the federal government would subsidize a portion of their premium.

On the surface, it may seem that lawmakers voted to cut Medicare spending under the new health law, but they instead cut the rate of growth. As a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office notes, the amount of spending for Medicare will continue to increase over the next decade, from $499 billion in 2009 to $929 billion in 2020.

And even though $500 billion in spending is being reduced, health care experts say the quality of care should not be shortchanged.

""Some (reforms) increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage,"" said Tricia Neuman, vice president and director of the Medicare Policy Project at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, in a video on the foundation’s website.

""Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending to help the program operate more efficiently and help fund coverage expansions to the uninsured in the underlying health reform legislation,"" Neuman said. ""Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care.""

Ryan plan

While Rubio said he would support any plan that ""saves Medicare,"" he also said that ""Medicare as we now have it is not an option"" because of the cost. Ryan’s plan would completely overhaul the Medicare system.

Currently, any senior 65 or older is eligible for Medicare, which provides health care coverage for the vast amount of elderly Americans. The program provides health insurance for 39 million seniors and another 8 million people under the age of 65 receiving Social Security benefits.

Under Ryan’s plan, starting in 2022 seniors would choose a private health insurance plan from a designated ""Medicare exchange."" The federal government would contribute an average of about $8,000 toward the annual premium for the private insurance plan. Ryan notes that this will result in a cost savings. But a CBO report notes that while government spending for beneficiaries would go down, the burden would then fall on beneficiaries to pay more out of pocket to cover the rest of their medical expenses. 
""To summarize, a typical beneficiary would spend more for health care under the (Ryan) proposal than under CBO’s long-term scenarios for several reasons,"" the CBO report states. ""First, private plans would cost more than traditional Medicare because of the net effect of differences in payment rates for providers, administrative costs and utilization of health care services. … Second, the government’s contribution would grow more slowly than health care costs, leaving more for beneficiaries to pay."" 
For example under Ryan’s proposal, according to the CBO, the cost to buy private insurance in 2022 would be about $20,510 a year. Even with the estimated $8,000 federal subsidy, the senior would still have to pay the difference of $12,510, about $1,000 more a month. 
Compare that to the Medicare program under the current health care law, the estimated cost to provide insurance would be about $14,770 in 2022, according to the CBO. That would leave the senior to pay just $6,150 out of pocket -- about $500 a month. 
Ryan’s plan, as noted in this news article from the Associated Press, also intends to keep the $500 billion in reductions that Republicans have criticized Democrats for approving under the Obama plan. 
How does that all add up? Neither the current law nor the Ryan plan would ""cut"" Medicare. Under both plans, the money allocated for Medicare in the budget would continue to grow for the next 10 years. The reduction -- under both plans -- is only in the rate of growth. Both Ryan's plan and the health care law would decrease the rate of growth. 
So what was Rubio speaking about? 
Rubio's position 
We turned to Rubio press secretary Alex Burgos to get a better understanding of Rubio’s take. 
""The Medicare cuts under ObamaCare are already current law,"" Burgos wrote in an e-mail on May 5, 2011. ""They are part of CBO's baseline. It does not follow that supporting the Ryan budget is the same as supporting the Medicare cuts in ObamaCare."" 
Burgos referred us to a statement made by Ryan press secretary Conor Sweeney to the Associated Press on April 13, 2011. Sweeney states that Ryan’s plan ""ensures that all current-law savings and future reforms are devoted to saving Medicare."" 
Burgos made it a point to underline ""current-law savings."" Still we wondered, aren’t the ""current-law savings"" Ryan's office touts a result of the same ""cuts"" to Medicare Sen. Rubio was referring to in his interview? 
Not according to Burgos, who counters that under the current health law, ""that money is being cut from Medicare to fund a health care experiment outside of Medicare,"" Burgos responded. The ""experiment,"" Burgos said, is the federal health care law approved last year. 
""The Ryan budget acknowledges these current cuts as the law, but ensures that money is preserved within Medicare,"" Burgos said. So Rubio's position is that what he calls a ""cut"" under the current law isn't a cut when it's included in the Ryan plan because it's already the law. 
The Ryan budget, however, is fairly explicit that it is reducing future spending in the Medicare program with the aim of restoring balance to the federal budget. If the Democratic health care law reduced future Medicare spending in order to expand coverage to the uninsured, then the Republican plan reduces future Medicare spending in order to reduce the deficit. In both cases, future Medicare spending is being reduced in order for the parties to pursue other policy goals. 
Our ruling

So back to the question. Was Rubio accurate in stating that those who voted for the federal health care law, in essence, voted to cut Medicare? 
To his credit, during his interview, Rubio did state that the cuts would be spread out over the next 10 years, instead of making it seem like the money would come out of the current-year budget. However, Rubio still identifies those who voted for the federal health care law as those who voted to ""cut Medicare,"" without noting that spending on the program is still expected to increase. 
The vote taken by Congress was not to cut Medicare but to reduce the rate of growth by $500 billion by targeting inefficiencies in the program. That's a cost-reduction plan that Ryan himself kept intact in his own budget proposal. Republicans, meanwhile, voted for a budget plan that envisions spending less on Medicare in the future to restore fiscal balance to the federal budget and reduce the deficit. Both parties have voted -- at different times and on different proposals -- to reduce future spending for Medicare.

We rate Rubio’s claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/may/10/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-says-those-who-voted-federal-healt/
"['Immigration', 'Crime', 'Texas', 'Silvestre Reyes']","
Silvestre Reyes says Ohio's most populous cities have higher crime rates than cities on U.S.-Mexico border
","
U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-El Paso, teed off on House Speaker John Boehner by comparing cities in Boehner’s home state of Ohio to communities along the U.S.-Mexico border.

On Monday, the day before President Barack Obama’s swing through El Paso and Austin, Reyes first noted a comment by the Republican speaker’s spokesman, Michael Steel. Steel said last week that before Congress takes up immigration policy, the priority ""must be ending the violence at the border — we really can’t deal with other issues until it is secure."" His comment appeared in the May 3  issue of Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper.

Boehner, Reyes said in a press release, ""should focus on controlling the level of violence in his own state before tarnishing the image of border communities that remain among the safest places to live in America. ... The fact remains that the six largest cities in Ohio all have higher rates of violence and crime than every major city along the U.S.-Mexico border.""

Whoa. Do the Buckeye State’s largest cities have more violence and crime?

Looks like it.

As backup, Reyes cited research compiled by CQ Press, which said in a November 2010 press release that its latest compilation of city-by-city crime information reflects data for cities of at least 75,000 residents that reported crime data to the FBI for its Uniform Crime Reporting Program as of September 2010.

In 2009, over all, Ohio’s six most populous cities—Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Toledo, Akron and Dayton—had higher crime rates than six border cities: San Diego, El Paso,  Laredo, Brownsville, McAllen and Yuma, Arizona. The best-rated Ohio city, Columbus, was 49th, the worst-rated border city, Laredo, was 144th, according to CQ Press.

We verified the population of each of the dozen cities with the U.S. Census Bureau. Its 2010 counts suggest the average population of the Ohio cities was nearly 363,000 while the average population of the border cities was a little more than 447,000.

According to CQ Press’s report, the six Ohio cities had higher rates of murder, rape, robbery and burglary than the six border cities. For murder, specifically, the Ohio cities’ rates ranged from Dayton’s 25.5 per 100,000 residents down to Akron’s 9.7 per 100,000 residents. Among the border burgs, Laredo had the highest rate, 7.5 murders per 100,000 residents, El Paso had the lowest, 1.9.

In two crime categories, though, there are wrinkles unfavorable to the border.

Yuma had nearly 501 aggravated assaults per 100,000 residents, second among all the checked cities to Toledo, Ohio, which had 629 aggravated assaults per 100,000 residents. Four Ohio cities had higher rates than the other border cities, though Columbus, with nearly 170 aggravated assaults per 100,000 residents, had a lower rate than any border cities except Brownsville and McAllen.

For motor vehicle theft, Cleveland topped the reviewed cities with 939 per 100,000 residents. Laredo placed second, though, with nearly 654 per 100,000 residents and San Diego was third, with 570 per 100,000 residents. Next, the five other most populous Ohio cities had greater motor vehicle theft rates than Yuma, Arizona or McAllen. El Paso, 305 per 100,000 residents, and Brownsville, 188 per 100,000 residents, had the lowest rates of motor vehicle theft.

Summing up: The six largest Ohio cities had higher overall crime rates and rates of murder, rape, robbery and burglary than the six major border cities. Yet a border city had a higher rate of aggravated assaults than four Ohio cities while the rate for Columbus was higher than the rate in two border cities. Also, all but one of the Ohio cities had lower rates of motor vehicle theft than Laredo.

We rate the statement Mostly True. 
CORRECTION, 10:25 a.m., May 11, 2011: The day this article posted, we subsequently amended our reference to the 2009 rate of aggravated assaults in Columbus. The initial article incorrectly said the Ohio city had the lowest rate of all the checked cities. In addition, the article's conclusion was later amended to correct the Columbus reference.",/factchecks/2011/may/10/silvestre-reyes/silvestre-reyes-says-ohios-most-populous-cities-ha/

Doris Kearns Goodwin says no U.S. combat deaths under Eisenhower
","
During the May 8, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, historian and author Doris Kearns Goodwin offered a striking statistic about combat casualties under President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Host David Gregory began the exchange by playing a video clip from Robert Kagan, a foreign policy scholar and commentator who has advised several Republican office-holders.

""The American people,"" Kagan said, ""have an interesting quality in their character which you can trace all through their history. They want their presidents to be men of peace, but they also want to know that, if necessary, the American president can kill.""

Gregory asked Goodwin whether she thought Kagan had a worthwhile point in analyzing President Barack Obama’s recent success in ordering the killing of al-Qaida mastermind Osama bin Laden.

""I think that's right,"" Goodwin said. ""I mean, think of two of our most lovable presidents, Theodore Roosevelt, what was his slogan? Speak softly and carry a big stick. This was a big stick. Eisenhower, having won World War II, could then take enormous pride in the fact that not a single soldier had died in combat during his time. So I think what happened in this thing is, it's not just the public perception of Obama that's strengthened now because he acted as commander in chief, but you never know what happens internally to a president when they take a risky thing and it works. JFK took control of his presidency after the Cuban missile crisis. This guy will now take control of his presidency. I think he's going to be able to trust his own judgment even more than the military, and that's huge psychologically. And America feels better again. I mean, that's the huge thing that we don't know about how long that will last. But our prestige and our sense of ourself is now heightened for a while, and everybody wants that.""

We thought we’d look into whether Goodwin was correct that ""not a single soldier … died in combat"" during the Eisenhower presidency.

We knew that Goodwin’s claim had problems when we checked the starting and ending dates of the Korean War. It was an active conflict through the signing of a truce on July 26, 1953. Since Eisenhower was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 1953, he served as commander-in-chief for the final six months of the war. His presidency ended on Jan. 20, 1961.

The final six months of the Korean war included a battle that became emblematic of the war -- the Battle of Pork Chop Hill. The battle produced many casualties at a time when the powers were negotiating an armistice, even though the battle was fought to control a topographic feature that had little inherent value. In his book The Korean War, Max Hastings wrote that the battle reflected both the ""courage of the defenders and the tactical futility"" of that stage of the war.

How many casualties were there during those six months? We didn’t find any official government data with casualties separated by year, but we did find a private collection. The veteran-supported Korean War Project has a website that offers day-by-day casualty figures for the war. So we looked at the figures for the first six months of Eisenhower’s presidency and found 3,406 casualties.

Casualties, however, include non-combat deaths and non-mortal wounds, not just combat deaths. So we took casualty ratios for the entire Korean War and determined that combat deaths accounted for 24 percent of casualties. Multiplying this percentage by the number of casualties produces 802 combat deaths during Eisenhower’s six months in charge. (The total for the war was almost 34,000.)

The figure we came up with isn’t exact, but it seems safe to assume that combat deaths during that period numbered in the hundreds.

In addition, Eisenhower was president during the start of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. At the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the National Mall, the names of the fallen begin with Air Force T-Sgt. Richard B. Fitzgibbon Jr., with a casualty date of June 8, 1956. The number of casualties in Vietnam remained much smaller than the number during the final part of the Korean War. The first battlefield fatality came in late 1961, almost one year into the Kennedy Administration.

Eisenhower also presided over some small-scale military deployments in or near Taiwan, Lebanon and Cuba, and he was president during the Suez crisis of 1956. But we were unable to confirm any casualties for these events.

Meanwhile, a lower-profile source of U.S. casualties stemmed from covert operations related to the Cold War.

""Eisenhower ordered a wide array of covert operations against the Soviet Union and Communist China, including clandestine overflights of both countries, during his two terms, and some of those missions involved American deaths,"" said Lance Janda, a historian at Cameron University in Lawton, Okla. ""The deaths were generally kept secret and did not occur during declared wars or major operations known to the public, and for that reason a scholar might argue they technically do not fall into the ‘combat death’ category. But I would find that line of reasoning extremely suspect. Eisenhower ordered Americans into harm’s way in support of the national interest, and their deaths therefore fall very clearly in my view under his responsibility as commander-in-chief.""

All this means Goodwin’s statement is incorrect.

She’s ""wrong, and not just technically so,"" said William W. Stueck, a historian at the University of Georgia.

When we contacted Goodwin, she immediately acknowledged her error.

""What I was reaching for when I talked was a more general point -- which is accurate -- that the general who had overseen major battles in a time of war was basically a man of peace during his presidency, thus fitting the idea that Americans love men of peace who can also kill,"" Goodwin said. ""That would have been a better way of putting it!""

Goodwin does have a point. After the shooting war on the Korean peninsula had ended -- a war that Eisenhower had inherited and which he ended within six months-- Eisenhower did preside over a relatively peaceful seven and a half years, particularly compared to his two immediate predecessors (Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman) and two of his three successors (Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon).

""Eisenhower was extremely skillful when it came to foreign policy and military affairs,"" Janda said. ""He was extraordinarily judicious in his application of American power, negotiating severe crises over Indochina in 1954, the Taiwan Strait in 1955, and Suez in 1956, which could easily have led to massive U.S. intervention and/or the use of nuclear weapons. He was also a powerful proponent of covert operations and diplomacy during one of the most difficult periods of the Cold War and the president who argued most forcefully of the dangers posed by the military-industrial complex.

Kathie Tovo says Austin Energy considering first rate bump since 1994
","
Answering a question for the May 1 ""Voters Guide"" from the League of Women Voters of the Austin Area, City Council hopeful Kathie Tovo made us check our pocketbooks. Tovo said: ""Austin Energy,"" the city’s electric utility, "" is considering its first rate increase since 1994.""

We wondered about that, since our first thought was that surely electric bills went up during that time. Tovo’s campaign manager, Mark Yznaga, told us Tovo was referring to the utility’s base charge for electricity. News reports and posts on Austin Energy’s website show hearings are expected to culminate in the City Council considering a rate bump as soon as later this year.

The utility says in a January ""Austin Energy Rate Review"" newsletter that since 1994, it’s added more than 100,000 customers, experienced big increases in the cost of materials and services and added business functions while expanding others such as energy efficiency and solar rebate programs. At the same time, the article says growth in Austin Energy electric sales has trended downward of late, requiring the utility to dip into its reserves for operations.

Echoing the newsletter article, Austin Energy spokesman Ed Clark told us the base electric rate, covering the costs of staff, the electric system, power plants, vehicles and the like, has not changed since 1994. It’s 3.55 cents for each of the first 500 kilowatt-hours of electricity used and 7.82 cents for each additional kilowatt-hour. Clark said customers also pay an unchanged $6 monthly service charge,

Yet that doesn’t mean they’ve paid the same amount for electricity every year.

Their bills include such variables as a fee for statewide transmission costs added by the Texas Public Utility Commission in November plus a fluctuating fee tied to ups and downs in fuel costs. At our request, Clark told us what an average residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt-hours a month would have been billed each August from 1994 through 2011. For the period, we calculate, the fuel charge averaged 2.322 cents per kilowatt-hour, though it’s exceeded that every year from 2004 on.

In 1994, the bill for 1,000 kilowatt-hours would have been $79.14. In 2010, the bill for using that much electricity was $100.20 -- an increase of 27 percent. In August 2011, the same usage would be billed $94.72, due to a drop in the fuel charge. Put another way, the 2011 charge looks to be 20 percent more than what it cost a customer using the same amount of electricity in 1994.

A-ha! Is it really fair to say Austin Energy’s rates have not increased since 1994?

Well, we realized, our comparison failed to consider inflation over the years. According to our check using the Consumer Price Index inflation calculator posted online by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 2011 bill actually ends up about $15 less than the comparable 1994 bill. When we ran this by Austin economist Stuart Greenfield, he pointed out that according to a finer inflation adjustment tied to household energy prices, the average August 2010 bill was about $33 less than what it was in 1994.

At a glance, still, Tovo’s statement could leave the misimpression that utility customers haven’t had to dig out more dollars for electricity since 1994. They have. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/may/10/kathie-tovo/kathie-tovo-says-austin-energy-considering-first-r/

Wisconsin GOP Rep. Petri says Obama commission recommended vouchers for Medicare
","
When House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan submitted his 2012 federal budget plan in April 2011, he touted how much more it cut spending, debt and deficits than President Barack Obama’s plan.

Some of the loudest objections to the Wisconsin Republican’s proposal, however, decried its transformation of Medicare. MoveOn.org, a left-leaning political advocacy group, went so far as to say Ryan would abolish the 46-year-old program in 10 years.

We ruled that claim False, partly because current Medicare recipients would continue to receive traditional Medicare even after 10 years.

But, as we noted, Ryan’s plan would change Medicare dramatically. Starting in 2022, Medicare would no longer directly help pay for doctor visits, hospital care, other services and prescription drugs. Rather, future Medicare participants would choose a private insurance plan and Medicare -- through what are called premium-support payments or vouchers -- would help pay for the insurance.

The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan group that studies health care policy, noted that in the days after Ryan’s budget plan was released, three national polls found Americans divided on such a change.

Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Tom Petri, R-Wisconsin, was conducting his annual survey of constituents. In his April 2011 newsletter, the 32-year Fond du Lac congressman posed this question to residents in the 6th District, which is north and west of Milwaukee:

""One of the recommendations put forth by the president’s debt commission was to convert the Medicare system from a government-run insurance program to a system where Medicare participants are given a voucher to purchase insurance in the private market. Would you support such a change?""

That left us with this question: Did a commission created by a Democratic president recommend the same sweeping change to Medicare that was part of the House GOP budget?

The debt commission mentioned in Petri’s question -- the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform-- was formed by an Obama executive order in February 2010. The 18-member panel included Ryan, who was appointed by Republican leaders of the House of Representatives.

The commission was charged with making recommendations to balance the federal budget, excluding interest payments on the debt, by 2015. The recommendations came in a report issued in December 2010. This is what Petri’s survey question cited in saying the commission recommended a voucher program for Medicare.

The word voucher appears only once in the commission’s 66-page report, as part of Recommendation ""3.3.13."" The recommendation addressed Federal Employees Health Benefits, the health insurance program for federal employees and retirees.

The commission said the insurance should be made into a premium-support or voucher program. Federal retirees could use their voucher to pay part of their Medicare premium.

But that is for a limited group, federal employees and retirees.

That is not transforming all of Medicare into a voucher program. Had that recommendation been made, it undoubtedly would have stirred the same criticism that the Republican plan has.

The commission’s report noted that two commission members -- Ryan and Alice Rivlin, director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Bill Clinton -- had proposed converting Medicare into a voucher system. The commission’s view was that such a system ""holds significant promise of controlling costs, but also carries serious potential risks.""

The commission suggested that, if its recommendation were put in place to make health insurance for federal employees and retirees a premium-support or voucher program, ""that experience would be useful in considering a premium-support program for Medicare.""

So, the president’s commission recommended trying a voucher program with federal employees and retirees and then, based on the results, deciding whether to try it with Medicare.

After we contacted Petri’s office on May 6, 2011, spokesman Niel Wright said the wording in the constituent survey question about Medicare was incorrect. He said the question should have stated that the president’s commission ""discussed,"" rather than recommended, making Medicare a voucher program.

Also after our call, this note was added to the electronic version of the survey question on Petri’s website:

""CORRECTION: The question above is somewhat misleading. Instead of saying that the recommendation was ‘put forth’ by the president's debt commission, the question should read that this recommendation was ‘discussed’ by the president's debt commission.""

Wright told us that when Petri’s office distributes results of the survey, a note will be included ""indicating that a problem with this question was brought to our attention,"" as would ""additional information clarifying how the question should have been phrased.""

Wright also said the survey was reviewed by the Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards, also known as the Franking Commission, and that ""neither the Republican nor the Democratic staffers at the commission noticed anything objectionable"" or partisan.  

Turning to the Truth-O-Meter, in surveying constituents, GOP Congressman Tom Petri said a commission created by the Democratic president had recommended making Medicare a voucher program. The commission did not make that recommendation and Petri admitted the wording in his survey was wrong.

"['Ohio', 'Labor', 'State Budget', 'John Kasich']","
Gov. John Kasich says federal workers have 'zippo, zero' ability to collectively bargain
","
Equity among workers is one of Republican Gov. John Kasich’s most consistent arguments in favor of Ohio’s new collective bargaining law.

The law, Senate Bill 5, will bring Ohio’s public workers closer in line with private sector workers, who, on average, pay more for health care benefits and have weaker pensions, Kasich repeatedly has said.

Now the governor is weaving collective bargaining for federal workers – or lack thereof – into his support for the law.

Even though SB 5 restricts collective bargaining for the state’s 360,000 public workers, they would still be better off than federal workers, Kasich recently told a Youngstown radio show.

""Two million federal workers negotiate zippo, zero,"" Kasich told radio host Dan Rivers on April 26 when discussing SB 5. ""There is no collective bargaining for federal employees.""

Kasich has been among the most vocal supporters of SB 5, and likely will continue to fill that role if the law heads toward a voter referendum this fall.

Considering his influence and the widespread interest in SB 5, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check the governor’s claim about collective bargaining for federal workers.

We did not have to dig deep to get started.

Our colleagues at PolitiFact checked a similar statement Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker made in late February, when his state, like Ohio, was in the middle of a controversial effort to pass legislation to limit collective bargaining for public workers.

Walker told NBC’s Meet the Press host David Gregory that ""most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for benefits, nor for pay.""

PolitiFact gave Walker’s claim a True rating. So how does Kasich’s similar claim hold up?

Federal workers generally cannot collectively bargain pay and benefits, but they can negotiate working conditions, according to the Federal Labor Relations Authority, which administers the labor-management relations program for more than 1 million federal workers.

""Employees also have the right to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives chosen by employees,"" the FLRA’s program guide reads.

There are about 1.6 million non-postal federal workers. Of those, about 1.1 million are represented by more than 90 labor organizations. Some workers in agencies such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission can negotiate wages. Others in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Government Accountability Office and other departments do not engage in collective bargaining.

For the most part, however, federal workers only can negotiate working conditions, said Sarah Whittle Spooner, FLRA counsel for regulatory and external affairs.

The right to negotiate working conditions is significant, said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell University. (PolitiFact also interviewed Bronfenbrenner while checking Gov. Walker’s claim. We interviewed her separately.)

Bronfenbrenner pointed to a recent union election among the Transportation Security Administration’s 43,000 workers. They had three options: either of two unions vying to represent them or no union at all. More than 16,000 of the workers voted in favor of a union representation and about 3,000 voted for neither union. Because the vote between the two unions was so close, there will be a runoff election May 23 to June 21.

""Would they have organized a union if they didn’t have the right to bargain?"" Bronfenbrenner asked. ""They wouldn’t have gone through all this if there wasn’t something at the end of the tunnel.""

So what does it mean for federal workers who can negotiate working conditions?

It means they can negotiate discipline policies, hours of work, procedures for performance evaluations, safety, procedures for layoffs and more, according to the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employees union, with about 625,000 members from about 75 federal agencies.

Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols acknowledged federal workers do have some ability to bargain collectively.

""The fact is most federal workers cannot collectively bargain for pay or benefits and the governor’s point is that under Senate Bill 5, Ohio’s public employees will have more collective bargaining rights than most federal employees,"" Nichols said.

So where does Kasich land on the Truth-O-Meter?

It would be easy to rate Kasich’s statement False. Federal workers may have limited collective bargaining powers. But that isn't ""zippo"" and ""zero.""

But the governor also is known to shoot from the hip, and ruling an off-the-cuff statement as False without looking at his underlying meaning would amount to a game of gotcha -- a game PolitiFact doesn’t play.

Kasich long has advocated reigning in collective bargaining, arguing that schools and governments needed better ability to control labor costs. But he has not called for it’s elimination.

Changes approved in SB 5 would reduce the number of topics subject to union negotiations, ban public workers from striking, prohibit employers from paying more than 85 percent of workers’ health insurance costs, and base pay raises on performance rather than length of service.

But public workers in Ohio would continue to have more collective bargaining powers than most federal workers, Kasich’s underlying point.

That some federal workers can bargain over working conditions, rather than having ""zero"" collective bargaining ability, is a critical fact, though, that could give a listener a different impression.

Bloggers say Nancy Pelosi in 2006 said getting bin Laden doesn't make us ""any safer""
","
After the killing of Osama bin Laden in a special forces attack on May 1, 2011, it didn’t take long for conservative bloggers to offer up a 2006 quote from House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that expressed skepticism about the importance of eliminating the terrorist who masterminded the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

On May 2, 2011, the conservative PowerLine blog posted a quote it said came from Pelosi in 2006. Others followed, including Michelle Malkin’s blog, Fox Nation and Commentary magazine. Here’s the PowerLine version:

""(E)ven if (Osama bin Laden) is caught tomorrow, it is five years too late. He has done more damage the longer he has been out there. But, in fact, the damage that he has done is done. And even to capture him now I don’t think makes us any safer.""

The blog paired that with a statement that Pelosi -- the former House speaker and now the House minority leader -- released shortly after President Barack Obama announced bin Laden’s death to the nation on May 1:

""The death of Osama bin Laden marks the most significant development in our fight against al-Qaida. I salute President Obama, his national security team, Director Panetta, our men and women in the intelligence community and military, and other nations who supported this effort for their leadership in achieving this major accomplishment. … (T)he death of Osama bin Laden is historic.""

PowerLine went on to argue that her seemingly different sentiments may have been colored by the fact that the White House in 2006 was occupied by a Republican (George W. Bush) and in 2011 by a Democrat (Obama).

""It is unfortunate that many public figures are unable to view events otherwise than through a partisan prism,"" PowerLine argued. ""Osama bin Laden's operational significance had undoubtedly dwindled over the years, and al-Qaida, after nine years of relentless attacks, is a shadow of its former self. But bin Laden's death is obviously an important and helpful milestone in the long war against radical Islam. …""

Several readers asked us whether Pelosi had really said that capturing Osama bin Laden does not make ""us any safer"". So we decided to look into it.

Pelosi did indeed say those words in a Sept. 7, 2006, press conference. In her opening remarks -- made just days before the fifth anniversary of the attacks -- she criticized the Bush administration and the then-Republican Congress for not enacting all the recommendations of the 9/11 commission.

Here’s a transcript of the full exchange that bloggers would eventually pick up on.

Reporter: ""Madam Leader, you mentioned Osama bin Laden, but that is a name we haven't heard in months, and now suddenly every time you turn around it is Osama bin Laden, Osama bin Laden. Now, not to throw you a real softball here, but what do you make of the idea that that is all in fact what we are hearing now? Do you think it is designed specifically to whip up fervor, fear, prior to the midterm elections?""

Pelosi: ""You know, I'm never one to question the motivation of people. I just want to question their effectiveness. Five years after 9/11, Osama bin Laden, who was going to be taken 'dead or alive'... you know what the president said at the time, and I wish that he had been... five years later he is still on the loose. The president said, 'You can run but you can't hide, Osama bin Laden.’ Apparently he could. And even if he is caught tomorrow, it is five years too late. He has done more damage the longer he has been out there. But, in fact, the damage that he has done is done. And even to capture him now I don't think makes us any safer.""

We think the bloggers are accurate in reporting Pelosi’s 2006 quote. She did indeed say that taking out bin Laden wouldn’t make the U.S. any safer, though we should also note that, from the context, it’s clear that she thought bin Laden should be pursued regardless.

The bloggers’ reporting of the second Pelosi quote -- the one from after bin Laden’s killing -- is incomplete, however. The final sentence of Pelosi’s statement reads, ""Though the death of Osama bin Laden is historic, it does not diminish our relentless pursuit of terrorists who threaten our country"" (emphasis added). In other words, the full text of what Pelosi said on May 1 communicates a more nuanced view, and one that’s less in conflict with her 2006 statement.

As it happens, Pelosi doubled down on this more nuanced view during her weekly news conference on May 5, 2011. Osama bin Laden, she told reporters,  ""is a person, he is a symbol. It is a historic event. ‘Hail to the Chief.’ (Obama) did a fabulous job. But it isn't an end to the threat to our national security... .""

Ultimately, we think the bloggers overstated the degree to which Pelosi’s 2006 and 2011 comments were contradictory. They are correct that Pelosi in 2006 said she didn’t think capturing Osama Bin Laden ""makes us any safer"" and then five years later celebrated his killing as ""historic."" But, because they left out the rest of her sentence referring to the threat that remains after bin Laden's death, we rate their claim Half True.",/factchecks/2011/may/09/blog-posting/bloggers-say-nancy-pelosi-2006-said-getting-bin-la/

Eric Cantor says almost 50 percent of Americans don't pay income taxes
","
House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has been unequivocal in demanding a ""real"" deficit reduction plan if House Republicans are to consider raising the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt ceiling.  

Cantor, R-7th District, recently appeared on CNBC’s ""Squawk Box"" to talk about various crises: namely the ""debt crisis,"" the ""spending crisis"" and the overall fiscal crisis the nation might face if we don’t cut spending.  

Entitlements must be addressed, said Cantor, who last month voted for a House Republican budget plan that would redesign Medicare and Medicaid. Cantor rejected increasing tax rates. But he acknowledged  the need for a ""pro-growth tax proposal"" that would eliminate some special interest tax deductions and loopholes to modestly increase revenue.

""We also have a situation in this country where you're nearing 50 percent of people who don't even pay income taxes,"" he said.

Is it true that half of all Americans pay no income tax? Let’s take a look.

First, a technical note. When Cantor says people, he means ""tax-filing units,"" which refers to individuals or couples that either file a tax return or would have if they had earned enough income, according to his staff.  

To support his assertion, Cantor’s camp provided a variety of studies and media reports that do indicate about 50 percent of U.S. households owed no federal income tax in 2009 -- the most recent year tax data are available.

In 2009, for example, the Tax Policy Center projected 47 percent of people would pay no income tax that year, up from previous estimates of 38 percent -- largely due to additional tax credits through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009.

Still, that’s a bit dated. Anything newer?

The Joint Committee on Taxation, sent a letter to Congress on the matter only days after Cantor’s ""Squawk Box"" appearance.

Using 2009 tax data, the committee estimated that slightly more than 50 percent of tax-filing units actually paid no income tax.

""In summary, for tax year 2009, approximately 22 percent of all tax units, including filers and non filers, will have zero income tax liability, approximately 30 percent will receive a refundable tax credit, and approximately 49 percent will have a positive income tax liability,"" the letter reads.

""That’s consistent with the numbers we’ve come up with,"" said Roberton Williams with the Tax Policy Center.  

""The main reason is the fact that we don’t specifically use the tax system to collect taxes; we use it for tax collections and to deliver social policy,"" he said. ""Because of that we end up giving people money that could be provided to them through spending programs.""

But because the U.S. uses the tax system to distribute money, it reduces the tax liability for 51 percent of tax filing units to, or below, zero.

Williams said that’s largely due to popular tax breaks, or tax expenditures.  

""There are lots and lots of them. We estimate they total more than a trillion dollars a year in reduced taxes and in fact the bulk of those go to the top end of the income distribution,"" he said.

Even so, because high earners have so much income liability, the breaks still don’t bring them down to zero. But popular lower and middle income breaks like earned income tax credits, child credits and mortgage interest deductions do get a majority of the population off the hook.  

So let’s look back.

Cantor acknowledged the need for eliminating certain tax loopholes and deductions while also pointing out that ""we also have a situation in this country where you're nearing 50 percent of people who don't even pay income taxes.""

Not only are we nearing that situation, but as the Joint Committee on Taxation pointed out shortly after Cantor’s statement, we moved beyond it. So we find the Majority Leader’s statement True.",/factchecks/2011/may/09/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-almost-50-percent-americans-dont-/

Wisconsin Sen. Lena Taylor says Gov. Scott Walker hasn’t created jobs, gives millions to friends and raises taxes on working people
","
Since budget protesters descended upon Madison in February 2011, Wisconsin has seen a barrage of television commercials, news releases and radio spots, with each side blasting the other.

One news release was particularly harsh:

As the Legislature’s budget-writing committee opened its hearings on the governor’s spending plan, state Sen. Lena Taylor (D-Milwaukee) issued a news release March 29, 2011, that made several sharp claims about Republican Gov. Scott Walker -- all rolled into one neat sentence:

""Gov. Walker has yet to create a job, he gives away millions to his friends, and he raises taxes on working people.""

Incompetence, corruption and raising taxes: sounds like the political equivalent of the trifecta.

Let’s examine Taylor’s statement, one claim at a time.  

Claim #1: ""Gov. Walker has yet to create a job.""

This goes at one of Walker’s main promises, to create 250,000 new jobs in his first term.

Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said: ""(Walker) typically talks about growing jobs in light of ensuring Wisconsin has a business climate that allows the private sector to create 250,000 new jobs, which is different than claiming the governor will directly create 250,000 new jobs.""

Officials are quick to claim the credit for job growth, and even quicker to assign blame elsewhere for job loss, but employment gains have much more to do with the economic cycle than individual politicians, said Bruce Hansen, an economics professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Nevertheless, if a person is in higher office at the time the economy tanks or improves, he or she typically gets the credit or the blame. So, let’s look at what has happened since Walker took office in January 2011.

According to Department of Workforce Development statistics, the state had a net gain of more than 13,000 jobs in January and February. To be sure, Walker’s policies hardly had time to take effect in that time frame, but that’s not what Taylor is citing as evidence.

Taylor said when she calculated the net job gain in January and February she took into account thousands of potential jobs that were lost when Walker killed a high-speed rail line to Madison.

In the past, Democratic groups have claimed somewhere between 10,000 and 13,000 jobs were lost when Walker rejected $810 million in federal funding for the new train link between Milwaukee and Madison.

PolitiFact gave a Barely True and Pants on Fire rating to variations on this claim, since -- among other reasons -- the groups double counted the number of jobs that were to be created.

Beyond that, the projections did not measure other impacts.

Walker might have saved some jobs in the airline, auto and gas industries by killing the rail line, said Steven E. Polzin, an expert on rail proposals from the Center for Urban Transportation Research at the University of South Florida, a pro cars and roads group.

But even if we were to accept Taylor’s calculations when it comes to subtracting jobs lost that were never created in the first place, and disregard Polzin’s thinking, Wisconsin still gained at least ""a"" job this year under Walker’s watch.

Claim #2: ""He gives away millions to his friends.""

In politics, friends can be a fairly ambiguous term. It can mean campaign contributors, ideological supporters or actual ... friends.

Does Taylor mean Walker literally gives million-dollar handouts to his golf buddies? Or that he uses state money to reward the governor’s supporters?

Taylor said she meant the latter.

""Throughout the January 2011 special session, the governor proposed and signed into law over $140 million in tax credits and contributions, which flows to a predominately corporate environment which has been strongly supportive and friendly to the governor,"" she told PolitiFact Wisconsin.

But Taylor’s evidence doesn’t exactly hold up after scrutiny.

For starters, the $140 million in tax credits and contributions don’t flow to ""a predominately corporate environment.""  

That figure incorporates a couple of different bills, including the Economic Development Tax Credit, which includes tax benefits for every job Wisconsin businesses create, and a tax break for Health Savings Accounts.

The Health Saving Accounts deduction primarily benefits individual workers who have an HSA, whether the workers voted for Walker or not. This credit allows people to deduct contributions they make to Health Savings Accounts from their state income taxes, as they can from their federal income taxes. Almost every other state already allows this.
   
And while the Economic Development Tax Credit does include a provision giving corporate companies additional tax cuts for locating their regional or national headquarters in Wisconsin, all businesses are eligible for the job creation tax breaks.

In other words, whether businesses are Walker’s friend or foe, they can obtain tax benefits from adding jobs.

Taylor also cited the recent Jack Links controversy, in which the snack food company was awarded a $75,000 grant. The company and its CEO made nearly $50,000 in contributions to the Republican Governor’s Association, which spent $5 million to help get Walker elected.

While Jack Links was awarded $75,000 after contributing $50,000 to Republican causes, the grant handed to the beef jerky company doesn’t validate Taylor’s statement. She has not provided evidence the company received the grant because of the political donations.

What’s more, the grant was for tens of thousands -- not millions -- of dollars. And the news release that was critical of the grant came out six days after Taylor's original statement.

Claim #3: ""He raises taxes on working people.""

Taylor’s evidence for this claim was pretty straightforward: ""Governor Walker strips $41 million from the Earned Income Tax Credit in his 2011-’13 budget.  This move reduces the credit available for persons eligible for the EITC which means that their tax liability is increased or refund reduced.""

Walker’s response?

""Her blanket statement about taxing the working class is way too broad in scope and factually inaccurate when you look at the impact of taxes in the budget on the worker,"" spokesman Werwie told PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""While the EITC credit will decrease, Senator Taylor doesn’t talk about Governor Walker’s efforts to hold Wisconsin’s income and sales tax steady. The EITC only hits some workers.""

He also argued there is a net decrease in taxes under Walker’s budget.

This is true if we combine all of Walker’s tax policies. However, Taylor was referring only to taxes on working class people, which the Earned Income Tax Credit reduction affects the most.

And the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau backs up Taylor’s view that the change is a tax increase in an April 15, 2011 memo. In that memo, the bureau listed the EITC change under the ""tax increases"" section, saying families with multiple children will pay more to the state.

Where does all of this leave us?

In her statement, Taylor said ""Gov. Walker has yet to create a job, he gives away millions to his friends, and he raises taxes on working people.""

But the state gained 13,000 jobs in January and February, ruining Taylor’s argument of ""yet to create a job."" Walker has not given away millions of dollars to ""friends,"" and the ""corporate"" tax cuts cited as evidence by Taylor are, for the most part, available to all businesses in Wisconsin.

By taking out funds from the Earned Income Tax Credit, Walker has raised taxes on ""working people,"" meaning Taylor was spot on with one of her claims.

Taylor batted one for three in her news release-- great numbers for a baseball player, but not a strong percentage on the Truth-O-Meter.

We rate Taylor’s statement as a whole as Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/may/09/lena-taylor/wisconsin-sen-lena-taylor-says-gov-scott-walker-ha/
"['Georgia', 'Nathan Deal']","
Deal touts Georgia's bond rating
","
Despite all of this state’s budget troubles and the struggling economy, Georgia’s no deadbeat, Gov. Nathan Deal said.

During a speech before the Atlanta Press Club that looked back at his work during the first 100 days of his administration, Deal said Georgia’s long-standing practices have kept it in good financial shape.

Deal’s evidence was our state’s bond rating.

""We have maintained our AAA bond rating. We are one of only about seven states in the country that has such a rating,"" Deal said.

One in ""about seven"" states? That sounds great for Georgia, but do so few states have such good credit?

First, here’s a short primer on bonds. If Georgia needs more money than it has on hand for a major public project, it doesn’t borrow from a bank. Instead, it issues bonds, which are promises to pay back a loan with interest over a set period of time.  

""It’s just like a huge mortgage, essentially,"" said Lee McElhannon, the director of bond finance at the Georgia State Financing and Investment Commission.

Members of the public buy the bonds as they would any investment. To figure out the likelihood that the state will make good on its bond, they consult information from the three major credit ratings companies: Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch.

These corporations analyze states’ credit worthiness and assign their bonds ratings based on factors such as the state’s existing debt, government framework, and economy.

The highest rating is AAA (or Aaa for Moody’s). A high rating means a state will likely have an easier time raising money.

We contacted Deal spokeswoman Stephanie Mayfield, who gave us more information.

She said Georgia is one of eight, not seven, states that maintain a AAA bond rating with the three credit ratings companies, she said. We checked with the three ratings agencies and found she’s correct.

The other states are Delaware, Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia.

Every ratings agency says the state’s bond outlook is stable. Georgia has held on to its Moody’s Aaa rating since 1974, according to a report the agency issued in April.

In conclusion: The actual number of states with AAA ratings from all major credit rating agencies is eight.

Tracking District Attorney Seth Williams’ shifting stance on juvenile lifers
","Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams took to the opinion pages of The Philadelphia Inquirer last week to defend himself from criticism that he reversed his stance on the individuals who have been deemed ""juvenile lifers"" in the criminal justice system. Williams, a Democrat who is finishing out his second term as district attorney and will not seek re-election, apparently took issue with an early March Inquirer piece that indicated the DA had changed his previous stance on offering the chance of parole to those convicted of homicide when they were juveniles. In the piece, the Inquirer reported Williams and his staff intend to seek sentences of life without parole for at least three of the 300 Philadelphia juvenile lifers whose sentences are under review. The district attorney wrote in that letter to the editor published last week that ""the article is contradicted by the paper's prior reporting"" and that his ""approach to these cases is fair, reasonable, and consistent with the judgments of the Pennsylvania legislature and the U.S. Supreme Court."" So did Williams reverse his stance or not? We decided to put it to the test on our Flip-O-Meter, which specifically tracks whether politicians have gone back on their promises. Let’s look first at what Williams’ stance on juvenile lifers was, and why it’s been of interest over the last several years. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Miller v. Alabama that it’s a violation of the Eighth Amendment for states to require a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for individuals convicted of committing homicide before they turned 18. The court ruled those sentences should be ""uncommon"" and reserved for ""the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption."" By the end of 2012, the Pennsylvania legislature passed new sentencing requirements for juveniles convicted of first- or second-degree murder, ranging from a 20-years-to-life sentence to a 35-years-to-life sentence, depending on degree and how old the person was when the crime was committed. That new legislation applied only to new sentences handed down after the Miller decision. But things got complicated last year when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Miller v. Alabama decision to prohibit mandatory sentences of life without the possibility of parole for juveniles would apply retroactively. That set off a chaotic process in the criminal justice system that’s being resolved by district attorneys, judges and criminal defense attorneys across the state resentencing individuals according to new requirements, but largely leaving it up to judge’s discretion to make a final determination on each individual. There were about 480 juvenile lifers across the state system; 300 of those are from Philadelphia. Last summer, Williams said in an Inquirer interview that it was his goal ""to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel."" ""As long as I'm the D.A.,"" he said, ""we will not be asking for cases going forward for life without the possibility of parole for people under the age of 18 because of the same exact reasons articulated by the Supreme Court in Miller."" The promise earned Williams praise from progressive groups, and he was even lauded in a New York Times editorial that ended with: ""Now that Mr. Williams has put that principle into practice, district attorneys in other counties with large numbers of juvenile lifers have a clearer path to follow."" In the same Inquirer interview from last year, Williams said ""I've got a lot of people who are tweeting every day about juvenile lifers without parole."" Some of them he even responded to. On June 3, 2016, the district attorney tweeted to someone asking questions about his policy: ""we will have hearings for all 300 chronologically they will get new sentences that will allow for the possibility of parole."" He even doubled down when the person responded, asking: ""does that mean the Philly DAs office will not seek LWOP (life without parole) in any of those 300 cases?"" Williams tweeted back: ""just keep reading my last tweet."" So at the beginning of this month, the Inquirer wrote that it appeared Williams’ stance had shifted. Journalist Samantha Melamed reported Williams’ office, in a letter to a federal court, indicated it intends to seek life without parole in at least three of the cases it had reviewed so far. Officials from Williams’ office confirmed that this week, saying it’s so far made 96 offers, three of which were for life without parole. They refused to provide any information about those three cases, saying the offers are still under consideration by defense attorneys and the final determination will be made by a judge. The Inquirer reported one of the individuals who the DA’s office is recommending life without parole for is Andre Martin, who was 15 when he shot and killed police officer John Trettin in 1976. From the story: ""According to Inquirer coverage from 1976, Martin had an IQ of 80 and was high on Valium and marijuana when he shot a police officer through the window of an apartment in a public-housing project."" Following that March Inquirer story about Williams’ apparent shifting stance, Williams wrote in a letter to the editor that there was no change in his stance and quoted the Inquirer’s original June 2016 piece that read: ""[Williams] said he won't rule out life without parole in the most heinous cases, but he has taken heed of the Supreme Court's opinion, in Miller, that neuroscience shows teens' brains are not fully formed, reducing their culpability."" Melamed said the Inquirer stands by its reporting, which is ""why the district attorney’s claim appeared in the form of a letter to the editor rather than a correction."" Williams’ chief of staff Kathleen Martin said in an interview this week that ""he hopes or expects not to have a lot of murderers who were juveniles remain, but in certain circumstances, including heinous crimes, that might in fact happen."" She described the office’s process for reviewing each of the juvenile lifer cases, saying it’s assigned a team of assistant district attorneys and other stakeholders to review every case, starting with the oldest ones. They’re seeking out surviving family members of victims, combing through old case files and reviewing information from the Department of Corrections about how the inmates have operated in prison. After that process, the team determined that they’ll request life in prison without the chance of parole for at least three juvenile lifers from Philadelphia. When PolitiFact asked Martin, Williams’ chief of staff, about whether or not this move conflicts with Williams’ past statements saying ""all"" 300 individuals would have a chance at parole, she said the three inmates in question still do have that chance because ""the judge is always going to have a final determination."" But that would go against what the DA’s office is requesting. Martin also said Williams’ original quote to the Inquirer that he wanted ""to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel"" was referring to his goals ""moving forward"" in sentencing new juveniles. ""It’s clear that the DA had a goal, but in the most heinous occasions, that goal cannot always be met,"" Martin said. ""There are just unfortunately some cases in which the best interest of the community at large is that certain people remain in custody."" Our ruling District Attorney Seth Williams told The Philadelphia Inquirer last year that it was his goal ""to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel"" when it comes to re-sentencing juvenile lifers still in the Pennsylvania prison system. His office says he made clear there could be exceptions in the most heinous cases. That’s why Williams’ team contends his stance didn’t shift when it didn’t offer the chance of parole to three individuals so far as it continues the process of reviewing 300 cases of juvenile lifers in Pennsylvania. But we keep going back to when he tweeted that ""we will have hearings for all 300 chronologically"" and that ""they will get new sentences that will allow for the possibility of parole."" He then doubled down on that stance when asked directly about it on Twitter. The district attorney also indicated he agreed with the Miller decision, and wouldn’t seek life without parole for juveniles convicted of homicide moving forward. That’s since changed for at least three people who could remain in prison for life without the possibility of parole.

Florida Blue ended 2016 with 1 million members in Obamacare marketplace, Sebelius says
","Democrats have ripped apart the GOP plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, arguing that it will take away insurance from millions of Americans. Kathleen Sebelius defended President Barack Obama’s health care law, which she helped implement, in a March 12 interview on Meet the Press. The former head of Health and Human Services pointed to the experience of one of the main insurers in Florida, Blue Cross Blue Shield, which is headed by CEO Pat Geraghty, as a success story. ""Florida has not been a welcoming state to this law. Pat Geraghty ended up 2016 open enrollment with 1 million members in the Florida marketplace and as a company in the black. He said, ‘Of course this works. We can make it work. We can go forward.’ "" We decided to fact-check Sebelius’ claim about the number of Floridians who enrolled through the federal health care law in spite of Republican efforts against it, including from Gov. Rick Scott, who campaigned on a promise to repeal it. Florida Blue enrollment Blue Cross Blue Shield operates under the name Florida Blue in the Sunshine State. The insurer’s enrollment rose in recent years through the Affordable Care Act, said Paul Kluding, a company spokesman. At the end of the open enrollment season on Jan. 31, 2017, Florida Blue had 940,000 ACA members -- an increase from 715,000 in 2016. Florida Blue anticipated an increase because some other insurers, such as UnitedHealthCare and Aetna, exited the marketplace where consumers can shop for policies. ""The number fluctuates throughout the year, but historically the enrollment numbers actually increase within the few months following the open enrollment close date, so that number will probably rise slightly over the next couple of months,"" Kluding said. Florida Blue sells plans in all Florida counties and is the largest insurer participating in the federal marketplace in Florida. With all insurers combined, about 1.7 million Floridians enrolled through the federal health care law for 2017. So Florida Blue is the largest insurer on the marketplace. Sebelius and Geraghty both attended an annual health care conference at the University of Miami on March 3. At the conference, Kluding said, Geraghty told Sebelius ""that the company is now serving approximately 1 million individual members, and that Florida Blue has operated this ACA business profitably."" Florida Blue made a small profit in the ACA market -- a single-digit positive margin, Kluding said. Sebelius’ number about Florida Blue enrollment was close to the actual figure. But she is cherry-picking an example of an insurer that had success in a particular state. Michael Tanner, a health policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that there are vast differences in how insurers fared in various states. While Florida Blue may have done well, it’s counterpart in North Carolina ""did terribly,"" he said. In North Carolina, Blue Cross lost $405 million on medical expenses for ACA customers in 2014 and 2015 but stayed in the marketplace for 2017. The majority of Blue Cross insurers in the states are non-profits, making comparisons to other providers difficult. ""It's a little bit apples and oranges to compare Blues to other insurers -- they have a special non- profit status, and they are not taxed the same way. They have the largest market shares and historically being the insurer of last resort, their pool didn’t change as radically as a lot of other insurance companies did,"" Tanner said. While Florida Blue has seen rising enrollment, some other insurers have scaled back offering plans on the exchange in Florida or have exited the market entirely. (Half of the insurers doing business in Florida offer plans on the exchange.) UnitedHealthCare and Aetna exited the individual market, although Aetna is still writing off-exchange plans, said Amy Bogner, a spokeswoman for the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. Humana withdrew from 31 of the 38 counties in the individual market in Florida and canceled all off-exchange business. In August, Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini blamed a pre-tax loss of more than $430 million since January 2014 for the decision. Our ruling Sebelius said Blue Cross Blue Shield ended ""2016 open enrollment with 1 million members in the Florida marketplace."" Her number is close. Florida Blue said 940,000 people enrolled as of Jan. 31, and the insurer expects the number to rise. It's also important to note that some other insurers have scaled back or dropped out of offering plans on the exchange.   We rate this statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/mar/15/kathleen-sebelius/florida-blue-ended-2016-1-million-members-obamacar/

Is being in the United States unlawfully a 'crime'?
","As Florida House members took up a bill that would increase penalties for certain violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, participants noted a fundamental but often overlooked issue in the overall immigration debate: If you are in the United States illegally, does your mere presence in this country mean that you have committed a crime? It first came up in comments by Ingrid M. Delgado, associate for social concerns for the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops. She had come to the Florida House Judiciary Subcommittee on Criminal Justice on March 15, 2017, to testify against HB 83, a bill sponsored by Rep. Dane Eagle, R-Cape Coral, that would heighten the penalties for certain violent offenses -- including sexual battery, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, murder, and the use of a destructive device such as a bomb -- if the defendant was in the country illegally. Delgado said, ""Unlawful presence is not a crime. It is a civil violation."" A few minutes later, Rep. Jennifer Sullivan, R-Mount Dora, spoke in favor of the bill, saying she wanted to remind her colleagues about the legal status of the people the law targets. ""It amazes me, honestly, that we've even been talking about this as long as we have,"" she said. ""I feel like in the midst of this, something has gotten lost that is a crucial, main point. And that is the fact that we're talking about people who are here illegally. That means that, legally, they are breaking the law."" The bill ultimately advanced through the subcommittee on a party-line vote, with Democrats voting against it. But we wanted to get to the bottom of whether undocumented immigrants were committing a crime by just being in the country. According to legal experts, the answer is that most of the time, unlawful presence is not a crime. When we checked with the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops, Michele M. Taylor, the group’s associate director for communications, pointed to the 2012 Supreme Court case Arizona vs. United States. The majority opinion found that ""as a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the United States."" Experts agreed. Unlawful presence is neither a felony nor a misdemeanor, said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. It is a civil infraction that results in removal and a bar on re-entry for a certain period of time. ""Not everything that’s illegal — meaning against the law or violating the law — is a crime,"" Shapiro said. ""There are civil violations, like when you get a parking ticket. ‘Unlawful presence’ is one of these. You don't go to jail or receive any other criminal punishment for being in the country illegally — you get deported."" Gabriel (Jack) Chin, a professor and director of clinical legal education at the University of California-Davis law school, echoed this analysis. ""It is not a crime to be present in the United States without authorization, such as by overstaying a visa,"" Chin said. ""But such a person is subject to being deported."" That said, it’s also important to distinguish between ""unlawful presence"" and ""unlawful entry,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. Improper entry by an alien is indeed a misdemeanor, Roosevelt said. This distinction can make the use of these terms tricky. For instance, an undocumented immigrant who entered the United States improperly would have committed a crime. However, once that person is here, the simple act of being in the United States unlawfully is not by itself a crime. ""It is a crime to cross the border other than as designated by immigration officials, but there is no separate crime for being unlawfully present in the United States,"" Chin said. Another example of illegal entry would be if an individual is found in the United States after previously having been deported. ""Unlawful re-entry after a deportation order can be a federal crime, depending on circumstances,"" Taylor said. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that generally opposes loosening immigration laws, said that while illegal presence is not a crime, it’s easy for such individuals to run into separate criminal problems even beyond their method of entry, such as filling out an employment eligibility form to get a job when they aren’t eligible to work. Our ruling Delgado of the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops said, ""Unlawful presence (in the United States) is not a crime."" It is generally accurate that the simple act of being in the United States illegally is not, by itself, a crime. Rather, it’s a civil violation that puts the individual at risk for deportation, but not for criminal prosecution. However, it’s worth noting that someone who is unlawfully present might still have committed a related crime by entering the United States after having been deported, for instance, or entering in an illegal manner.

Taking a closer look at Florida Democrat's claims about the gender pay gap
","Dozens of women rallied Tuesday at the Florida Capitol to fight for equal pay for women and men. Democrats organized the rally to bring attention to SB 410 and HB 319, which have not been scheduled for a hearing. The bills would enact penalties on employers who pay women less than men, allow victims of discrimination to sue for wages, and would extend protections to the transgender workers. An official of the Democratic Women's Club of Florida offered up a quick snapshot of the reality of today’s gender pay gap, which refers to the difference between what men and women earn. ""A woman working full-time is paid 79 to 80 cents for every dollar a man is paid, and it's even less for women of color, and on average $11,000 per year is lost simply because she isn't a man,"" said one of the club’s vice presidents, Patricia Farley. We did not hear back from Farley, but PolitiFact has explored claims about the gender pay gap more than once. Farley is referencing data widely available from the U.S. Census Bureau. ‘A woman working full-time is paid 79 to 80 cents for every dollar a man is paid’ This stat has become a rallying cry for those who seek to eliminate employment discrimination based on gender. And it’s backed by U.S. Census Bureau data. In a report released in September 2016, the Census Bureau wrote that in 2015, the female-to-male earnings ratio of full-time, year-round workers was 0.80.   Translated into dollars, that means that in 2015, women working full-time earned 80 cents for every dollar earned by men working full-time. The figure should be used with caution. For instance, former President Barack Obama’s administration released an ad that said women are paid ""77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men"" in 2012. That’s not accurate. The figure derived from a federal government measure actually refers to the average disparity between what men and women earn, so saying ""the same work"" is inaccurate. Also, discrimination is not the only explanation for a difference in pay. Other factors include: the degrees women pursue, the jobs women pursue, time taken off to take care of children, and the number of hours worked and experience. For instance, as of 2014, women worked in more minimum wage jobs than men. Excluding all those factors, a study by the American Association of University Women 2013 found a 7 percent wage gap between men and women a year after graduating college. As Farley said, women of color earn even less. A 2014 report from the National Women’s Law Center concluded that black women made 60 cents to the dollar earned by a white man, and Hispanic women made 55 cents, according to the report. Asian-American women actually earn higher wages than black and Hispanic men and women, as well as white women according to Pew Research. Still, Asian-American women lag behind white males for annual earnings. ‘On average $11,000 per year is lost’ Farley’s last point can be calculated by looking at the same 2015 Census data for the median earnings of full-time, year-round workers who are 15 years old and up, regardless of occupation. If you look at those numbers, the median wage in 2015 was $40,742 for women and $51,212 for men. The average difference is $10,470, which is very close to Farley’s $11,000. This pattern holds consistent if you look at data from the last five years. Other data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks average annual weekly median earnings of full-time salary workers 16-and-older using the Current Population Survey. In 2016, median weekly earnings for women were $749, or $38,948 a year. Men brought in $915 a week, or $47,580 a year. This produces a smaller average annual earnings difference of $8,632. Experts have said, however, that looking at a longer period of time would be more useful to draw conclusions. ""I think the average does help, but I'd rather see the lifetime earnings calculated for the mean and median female worker rather than extrapolating from the average for one year,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, told us in 2014. Our ruling Farley said that a ""woman working full-time is paid 79 to 80 cents for every dollar a man is paid, and it's even less for people of color, and on average $11,000 per year is loss every year simply because she isn't a man."" Farley is citing common talking points that can be backed up by data from the U.S. Census Bureau. While her figures are accurate, a bulletproof number to illustrate the gender gap will always be murky because the difference in pay can be affected by the careers women and men choose and taking time off to take care for children.

Do half a million people in Florida have Alzheimer's disease?
","A Florida physician who specializes in geriatrics and memory care warned a Florida Senate committee that Alzheimer’s disease is both a present and a looming problem for the state. ""Please make no mistake -- we are in the midst of an epidemic of Alzheimer’s disease,"" Rosemary Laird, a geriatrician at the Centre for Senior Health in Winter Park, told the Senate Health Policy Committee on March 14. ""Currently, half a million Floridians have Alzheimer’s disease, and in less than 10 years, a 40 percent growth rate means that another 200,000 Floridians will develop this devastating illness."" Laird was testifying in favor of SB 1050, a bill sponsored by Sen. David Simmons, R-Longwood, to establish a memory disorder clinic at Florida Hospital in Orange County. Laird’s office did not return a call, but we were able to find statistics that closely matched what she told the committee. They were cited in ""2017 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures,"" a report by the Alzheimer’s Association, the leading advocacy group for patients with the severe memory-loss condition and their families and caregivers. The report, in Table 4, offers projections for state-by-state numbers of residents with Alzheimer’s in 2017 and 2025. For Florida, it lists 520,000 people with the disease in 2017 and 720,000 for 2025, a growth rate of 38.5 percent. Rounded off, those are essentially identical to the figures Laird cited. However, it’s worth noting that the table cites these figures as ""estimates"" (for 2017) and ""projected"" (for 2025). The numbers in the report are footnoted to a study published in the academic journal Neurology in May 2013. The authors used Alzheimer’s diagnosis statistics from 2010 to create estimates of how many cases would be expected in future years as far out as 2050. Given the margins of error in estimates and projections, and given the difficulty of diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease in patients, it’s a slight overreach for Laird to frame these as hard numbers of Floridians who have the disease today. They are a useful yardstick and were published in a respected scientific journal, but her phrasing suggests too high a degree of certainty about the numbers who have the disease today. ""It is accurate to say that the numbers are estimates, or as we put it in the report, ‘projections,’ "" said Laura Cilmi, a spokeswoman for the Alzheimer’s Association.

Mick Mulvaney's misleading claim that House GOP health care plan keeps Medicaid expansion
","More than 10 million Americans have gained health insurance coverage because of expansions to Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Medicaid is a government-run health insurance program that primarily serves low-income Americans. If Congress repeals the law known as Obamacare and replaces it with the leading Republican proposal, there could be as many as 14 million fewer Medicaid enrollees by 2026, compared to projections under current law, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Mick Mulvaney, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, says the CBO analysis is wrong. ""The CBO score assumes that if you are on Medicaid today that you choose to get off Medicaid after the mandate goes away,"" Mulvaney said to reporters March 13, speaking of the Affordable Care Act’s mandate that most individuals purchase insurance. ""Does that make sense to anybody? That you are on a free program — because the plan doesn't get rid of Medicaid expansion."" We decided to fact-check Mulvaney’s claim that the leading House Republican proposal — the American Health Care Act — ""doesn’t get rid of Medicaid expansion."" We found his claim misleading. While the legislation doesn’t explicitly repeal the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, it reduces federal funding for the program to the point that many states would likely find continuing it unsustainable. How the Republican proposal stifles Medicaid expansion Individual states administer their own Medicaid programs, with financial assistance from the federal government, and each state sets its own specific parameters for Medicaid eligibility. Since the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, 31 states and the District of Columbia opted to expand those parameters to include all people with incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty line. On average, the federal government matches 57 percent of each state’s Medicaid expenditures. But it pays at least 90 percent for additional Medicaid enrollees who were made eligible by the expansion. The House Republican health care proposal says states can keep their expanded eligibility parameters. However, starting in 2020, the federal government would no longer pay extra for new Medicaid enrollees who are eligible because of the expansion — doing away with a vital component of the policy, the money. That means Medicaid costs would go way up for state governments that opted to continue their expanded programs. In order to maintain their current level of coverage, it would cost states an additional $253 billion over 10 years, according to estimates by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. As a result, the CBO and independent experts anticipate that states will decide to pull back from the Medicaid expansion, and states that were considering expanding their eligibility requirements in the coming years will decide against it. ""States don't have the wherewithal to pick up all of the substantially increased burden — especially when the next recession comes,"" said Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. Further, in seven states — Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Washington — state law requires ending Medicaid expansion if the federal government lowers its funding rate, or if the state has to take action to keep its own Medicaid costs from going up, according to Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Michael Cannon, health policy studies director at the libertarian Cato Institute, presented a different outcome in a blog post criticizing the House proposal as ""Obamacare lite — or worse."" Cannon predicted that by allowing the expansion to continue until 2020, voters, state officials and special interests will resist eliminating it. The House proposal says the federal government would pay the enhanced rate for Medicaid expansion enrollees who got into the program prior to 2020, as long as they maintain continuous coverage. However, changes in income and family situation, and thus Medicaid eligibility, happen frequently among low-income adults. Experts anticipate few individuals enrolled before 2020 will be able to maintain continuous coverage — especially given that the law would add more stringent requirements for coverage renewal. ""While this may seem like a reasonable way to protect coverage for those who already have it, in practice this means that the Medicaid expansion would wither on the vine and could shrink to nearly nothing in just a few short years,"" wrote Harvard University health policy professor Benjamin Sommers in the Washington Post. Our ruling Mulvaney said the House Republican health care ""plan doesn't get rid of Medicaid expansion."" The House Republican health care proposal does not explicitly repeal the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion. But by wringing out the funding that supports the expansion starting in 2020, experts predict states will have little choice but to abandon some or all of the expansion. In seven states, it’s actually required by state law. Mulvaney’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/mar/14/mick-mulvaney/mick-mulvaneys-misleading-claim-house-gop-health-c/

Donald Trump trumpets 40 percent decrease in illegal border crossings. Is he right?
","Illegal immigration from the U.S.-Mexico border dropped significantly during his first full month in office, President Donald Trump said in his first Cabinet meeting. ""In the first full month of my administration following the issuance of my executive orders, illegal immigration on our southern border fell by an unprecedented 40 percent,"" Trump said March 13. The Department of Homeland Security recently said there had been a 40 percent drop from January to February 2017 in illegal crossings at the southwest border. How much is Trump to credit for this decline and is it unprecedented? Experts say Trump’s hard-line immigration rhetoric likely played an important role, but other factors are also worth considering. The decline is a significant drop compared with recent years. Southwest border illegal crossings On March 8, DHS Secretary John Kelly described an ""unprecedented"" decline in illegal southwest border crossings from January to February. Total apprehensions at the southwest border dropped about 44 percent from January (42,504) to February (23,589). Total apprehensions include: - U.S. border patrol apprehensions between ports of entry, and - Inadmissibility determined by U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Field Operations at ports of entry. Specifically, the subset of apprehensions by border patrol along the U.S.-Mexico border decreased about 40 percent, from 31,578 in January to 18,762 in February. CBP historically sees a 10 to 20 percent increase in apprehensions from January to February, Kelly’s statement said. Monthly southwest border apprehension data for fiscal years 2012 to 2016 is available here and shows an uptick in apprehensions from January to February. But apprehensions may increase in coming months, according to DHS. ""We will remain vigilant to respond to any changes in these trends, as numbers of illegal crossings typically increase between March and May,"" Kelly said. ""However, the early results show that enforcement matters, deterrence matters, and that comprehensive immigration enforcement can make an impact."" Trump immigration orders, implementation memos Trump touted declines in illegal immigration along the southern border in the first full month of his administration and referenced directives he signed late January. Among things covered in Trump’s immigration orders and Kelly’s implementation memos: a directive to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall; authorization to hire 15,000 additional employees for immigration enforcement at the border and interior of the country; a stop to the practice of ""catch and release,"" or releasing immigrants caught illegally crossing the border. (Here’s a full recap.) Experts say Trump’s tough-on-immigration rhetoric played an important part in the reduction of illegal border crossings. But they also caution that one month’s worth of data is not enough to make a complete assessment and that other factors should also be considered. ""I do think that the election of President Trump is probably the most important factor driving these changes. But it is still very early to have firm conclusions,"" said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center. It’s likely that his rhetoric so far has had a stronger effect than his policies, as on-the-ground changes and implementation takes longer, Wilson said. ""The Trump administration’s rhetoric and executive orders have created uncertainty for potential migrants and in immigrant communities, and new fears that immigration enforcement will intensify both at the border and in the U.S. interior,"" said Faye Hipsman, a policy analyst with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank researching migration trends and policies. February 2017’s apprehension numbers represent a five-year low, Hipsman said. And the country hasn't seen a 40 percent decline in apprehensions in the last five years. But monthly apprehensions in fiscal year 2011 ""were regularly on par with this February’s figures,"" she said. ""The factors driving today’s border crossers — who are now majority Central American — are unchanged,"" Hipsman noted. ""Violence and insecurity still grip the region, poverty has not improved, and there are still tens of thousands of families living apart with some members in the U.S. and in others in Central America with desires to reunify."" And while apprehension data is generally used to measure illegal border crossings, past administrations have used both high and low apprehension numbers as an indicator of strong border enforcement, said Donald Kerwin, executive director of the Center for Migration Studies, a think tank studying international migration and member of a global network of migrant shelters and service centers. ""That metric can cut both ways,"" Kerwin said. Our ruling Trump said, ""In the first full month of my administration, following the issuance of my executive orders, illegal immigration on our southern border fell by an unprecedented 40 percent."" The numbers check out. February apprehensions declined 40 percent. Calling the decline unprecedented is a bit of a stretch, however. And experts warn that one month’s data is not enough to indicate a trend toward lower illegal immigration and that other factors, aside from Trump’s rhetoric and executive orders, should be considered in analyzing apprehension declines.

Paul Ryan's partially accurate claim on the Republican replacement for Obamacare lowering premiums
","Big headlines on March 13, 2017 confirmed what many on the left had feared about the Republicans' proposal for replacing Obamacare: The American Health Care Act, as the plan is known, would increase the number of uninsured by 24 million by 2026. That projection was made in a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, a gold-standard source for government information. But people on the right were ready with a response. In a statement issued the same day, House Speaker Paul Ryan began by making this claim: ""This report confirms that the American Health Care Act will lower premiums."" What we found is: It doesn’t, and then it does. And there’s more to the story. The report Let’s start off by making it clear that the Wisconsin Republican’s reference is to what is known as the individual or ""nongroup"" market -- that is, the roughly 7 percent of Americans who buy health insurance on their own because they aren’t covered by an employer or a program such as Medicaid. Here’s what the report says for those people: Increases: In 2018 and 2019, average premiums would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher than under Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. That’s mainly because the penalties under Obamacare for not getting insurance would be eliminated, ""inducing fewer comparatively healthy people to sign up."" Decreases: Premiums would start to drop in 2020. And by 2026, the premiums, on average, would be 10 percent lower than they would have been under Obamacare. That’s expected for several reasons: The GOP legislation would provide grants to states that could be used to reduce premiums; the bill would eliminate a requirement for insurers to offer plans covering certain percentages of health care expenses; and a younger mix of enrollees. While on average premiums are expected to eventually be 10 percent lower, the impact on different groups of people would be wide ranging. Under Obamacare, a 64-year-old can generally be charged premiums that cost up to three times as much as those offered to a 21-year-old. But under the GOP bill, it would be five times as much, unless a state chose otherwise. So, by 2026, premiums are projected to be 20 percent to 25 percent lower for a 21-year-old and 8 percent to 10 percent lower for a 40-year-old — but 20 percent to 25 percent higher for a 64-year-old. Some examples, for a people who earn $26,500 per year in 2026: The annual premium for a 21-year-old would be $5,100 under Obamacare, but only $3,900 under the GOP plan. For a 64-year-old, the premiums would be $15,300 under Obamacare vs $19,500 under the GOP plan. Finally, it’s important to look beyond what premiums will do. The report points out that compared to Obamacare, the GOP plan would require insurance plans to cover a lower percentage of total costs -- the insurance plans would have a lower ""actuarial value,"" so lower premiums would be buying less coverage. For example, a person’s deductible is expected to be higher than under Obamacare. Our rating Ryan says a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office ""confirms that the American Health Care Act will lower premiums."" His reference is to people who buy health insurance on their own, rather than getting it from an employer or a government program such as Medicaid -- and how the Republicans’ American Health Care Act compares to the existing Affordable Care Act. For those people, the report expects average premiums would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher in 2018 and 2019, but by 2026 would be 10 percent lower. And the report also says that out-of-pocket expenses, such as deductibles, would tend to be higher than under Obamacare.

Western PA congressman backs off ‘strange’ Obama shadow government claim
","Republican Congressman Mike Kelly was talking to a crowd in his district of Northwestern Pennsylvania earlier this month when he dropped a serious accusation against Barack Obama. He noted the former president had decided to stay in Washington, and not for the reasons Obama has given. ""He’s only there for one purpose and one purpose only,"" Kelly said, ""and that is to run a shadow government that is gonna totally upset the new agenda.""   Is that really what Obama stayed in Washington, D.C. to do? Obama announced late in 2016 he’d be sticking around in Washington for at least two years so his daughter Sasha could finish high school. He has office space paid for by the General Services Administration, a perk granted to all former presidents. According to the Chicago Sun Times, Obama is the first president since Woodrow Wilson to stay at a primary residence in Washington, D.C. after his tenure ended. Obama will be assisting former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in a Congressional redistricting effort, work Holder has described as a ""going into the states"" strategy. Holder also said Obama would be fundraising and interacting with state legislators.    No reports or intelligence has been released linking these post-presidency activities of Obama to a shadow government. And Kelly did not provide any evidence. A shadow government is commonly defined as a conflicting, secondary government led by members of the private sector that wields similar influence to the actual government. Kelly later withdrew his comments after they made national news. His spokesperson Tom Qualtere said, ""Because of the extraordinary interest in Rep. Kelly’s remarks, it is worth clarifying that Rep. Kelly does not believe that President Obama is personally operating a shadow government."" In another statement, Qualtere said, ""he was sharing the frustration of everyone in the room over how they believe certain Obama administration holdovers within the federal bureaucracy are attempting to upset President Trump’s agenda."" Kelly’s comments and his ensuing walkback landed in The Washington Post, The Huffington Post, The Hill and MSNBC. Aaron Blake, for the Post, wrote ""while the conspiracy theory is strange enough, the explanations offered by Kelly's office are something to behold."" A spokesperson for Obama did not respond to a request for comment. Our Ruling  Congressman Mike Kelly accused President Barack Obama of operating a shadow government, saying he was only staying in Washington, D.C. for that ""one purpose and one purpose only."" Yet there is no evidence Obama is running a shadow government, and Obama has provided another purpose for why he’s staying in Washington: so his daughter Sasha can finish high school. Kelly’s spokesperson later walked back the Congressman’s statement, saying ""Rep.

Are Mexican drug cartels working with 100,000 street gang members in Chicago?
","Echoing President Donald Trump’s views on criminal activity in the United States, the top executive with the National Rifle Association recently said crime is going up in many American cities and raised concerns about the role Mexican criminal organizations play. ""According to the FBI, drug gangs are expanding their networks all across the country. The FBI also says gang members are infiltrating law enforcement and even the military,"" Wayne LaPierre, NRA executive vice president, said Feb. 24 at the Conservative Political Action Conference. He continued: ""On the outside, gangs are committing more and more cross-border crimes. According to the FBI, Mexican drug cartels are working with 100,000 street gang members in Chicago alone. Think about that."" We were intrigued by LaPierre’s claim of Mexican drug cartels working with thousands of Chicago street gangs. An FBI report does offer this number, citing a media interview with a Drug Enforcement Agency special agent. But experts are skeptical about linking cartels to an estimated 100,000 street gang members in the city. National Gang Report The NRA referred us to a 2013 National Gang Report produced by the FBI’s National Gang Intelligence Center. It was compiled using surveys from the National Alliance of Gang Investigators Associations and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, open source reports and anecdotal information from gang investigators. The 2013 report affirmed that gangs in the United States have relationships with Mexican drug cartels and that they most commonly work with Los Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel. Specifically about Chicago: Mexican transnational criminal organizations ""partner with more than 100,000 documented street gang members in Chicago to advance their criminal activities,"" the report said. That statistic cites a September 2012 article from the conservative website The Blaze. The Blaze’s article centers on an interview with Jack Riley, then special agent in charge for the Chicago Field Division of the DEA. (The FBI referred our questions to the DEA.) Riley told the website the Sinaloa cartel likely had the strongest presence in Chicago out of all Mexican drug cartels. The cartels have made Chicago one of their main hubs due to its location, large Mexican population and high street gang activity, Riley told The Blaze. They also played a role in the city’s violent crime, he said. Regarding the 100,000 gang members figure, The Blaze reported: ""The drug cartels from Mexico have found willing business partners in more than 100,000 ‘documented’ street gang members in Chicago. The cartel operatives hide in plain sight, within the crowds of millions of hardworking Mexican citizens living in the city. ""It’s the perfect cover,"" Riley said. That number came up again in a November 2012 interview with the Washington Post. Attributing information to the DEA, the Washington Post reported that members of the Sinaloa cartel are selling record amounts of heroin and methamphetamine from Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood and that drugs then make their way to south and west Chicago in mostly African-American neighborhoods. ""Chicago, with 100,000 gang members to put the dope on the street, is a logistical winner for the Sinaloa cartel,"" Riley told the Washington Post. Experts weigh in John Hagedorn, a criminology professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, raised questions about Mexican cartels partnering with 100,000 gang members in Chicago, as the 2013 report said. ""The cartels have organizations in Chicago that supply mainly Latino gangs largely through kinship connections. Black gangs here have largely shattered and are not major wholesalers in drugs,"" said Hagedorn, who has researched gangs for more than three decades. ""The statement that the cartels 'partner' with 100,000 gang members is untrue, to be charitable."" DEA’s Riley has long linked the cartels to Chicago’s high rates of violence, Hagedorn said. While the cartels deal mainly with Latino gangs, the majority of homicide victims and offenders in Chicago are African-American, he said. Fulton T. Armstrong, a research fellow at the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies at American University, also had doubts about linking Mexican cartels to 100,000 gang members -- almost 4 percent of Chicago’s estimated 2.7 million population, he noted. ""I find the 100,000 figure very hard to believe. Law enforcement routinely exaggerates both the threats we face and their performance dealing with them,"" said Armstrong, who formerly was a national intelligence officer for Latin America, chief of staff of the CIA’s crime and narcotics center and career CIA officer. Armstrong said that when he also worked on the staff of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he repeatedly asked the DEA, the Office of National Drug Control Policy and other agencies for information on the flow of drugs within the country, but was told the data wasn’t available. His last unfulfilled request was in 2011, Armstrong said. Cartels' continued presence in Chicago The Sinaloa cartel exports and distributes wholesale amounts of methamphetamine, marijuana, cocaine, and heroin in the United States, James L. Jones, public information officer for the DEA’s Chicago field office told PolitiFact. ""It maintains the most expansive international footprint amongst Mexican cartels,"" Jones said. It also remains the largest supplier of drugs to the Chicago area and uses street gangs for distribution, Jones said. ""Chicago is home to an estimated 100,000 active gang members that are heavily involved in drug trafficking, violent crime, and other criminal activity,"" Jones said. ""These gangs operate as the primary mid-level and retail-level distributors of drugs in the city and are responsible for a significant portion of the city’s violent crime."" But it is not clear whether the 100,000 active gang members are all linked to Mexican cartels, which is what is suggested in LaPierre's original citation of the FBI. We asked the DEA for clarification on an estimate of how many or what percentage of the 100,000 are working with the cartels. ""That’s tough to quantify,"" Jones said. ""However, we know that cartels are the source for the drugs that are being distributed by the street gangs in Chicago."" The 2013 gang report cited by the NRA is not the latest version of the report.  The 2015 report no longer references the specific figure, but also notes that due to new survey methodology, the 2015 and 2013 reports do not compare. The 2013 report also offers an overall cautionary note: ""Due to inconclusive reporting and lack of confidence in estimates collected from the (National Gang Survey), the (National Gang Report) does not contain numbers or estimates of gang members in the United States."" It recommends contacting local agencies for more information. We reached out to the Chicago Police Department for the estimated number of street gang members in Chicago and how many of them are believed to be working with Mexican drug cartels. The department’s office of news affairs said it did not have a way to immediately provide a count. (AP in January citing the Chicago Crime Commission reported that the city had more than 150,000 street gang members, but many are not active. In January 2012, the commission released a gang book estimating there were more than 68,000 gang members in the city.)  Our ruling LaPierre said,  ""According to the FBI, Mexican drug cartels are working with 100,000 street gang members in Chicago alone."" LaPierre cites data in a 2013 national gang report produced by the FBI’s National Gang Intelligence Center. But it’s hard to gauge how solid that figure is, and experts question its veracity. The figure tracks back to a 2012 interview of a DEA special agent in The Blaze. The DEA told PolitiFact there’s an estimated 100,000 gang members in Chicago heavily involved in drug trafficking. It’s hard to quantify exactly how many of them are working with cartels, though cartels are the source for the drugs distributed by street gangs in Chicago, the DEA said. Independent experts, meanwhile, are skeptical about generalizing that all 100,000 street gang members — Latino and non-Latino — are collaborating with cartels, since the cartels mainly collaborate with Latino street gangs.

Donald Trump: One-third of counties have only one insurer on Affordable Care Act exchanges
","Insurance providers are ""fleeing"" Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges, President Donald Trump said at a March 13 ""listening session"" on health care. ""One-third of the counties — think of it, one-third — only have one insurer left,"" Trump said, adding that the Republican replacement for the 2010 health care law known as Obamacare will have ""far more choices, at a lower cost."" Trump has the right statistic about insurance provider participation. In 32 percent of counties, individuals looking to buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act online marketplace have just one choice for their insurance provider, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, last updated in November 2016. In several states, including Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wyoming, there’s only one insurance provider total participating in each state’s online marketplace in 2017.   That’s a significant change from 2016, when just 7 percent of counties — and one state, Wyoming — were limited to one insurance provider on the online exchanges. On the other end of the spectrum, Wisconsin has 15 insurance providers participating in the exchanges in 2017, and Ohio has 11.  It’s important to note that Trump’s claim doesn’t mean one-third of people have only one provider to choose from for health insurance. Because rural and sparsely populated areas tend to have lower competition, about 21 percent, or one-fifth, of exchange enrollees live in these counties where there’s only one insurance provider to choose from, according to Kaiser. So of the approximately 9.2 million people enrolled in the Affordable Care Act exchanges in 2017, about 1.9 million could only purchase insurance from one company. These individuals could still buy insurance outside the marketplace and from another provider. But if they did so, they wouldn’t be able to get a federal subsidy to defray the cost. Insurance companies that have dropped from the exchanges — including UnitedHealthGroup, Humana and Aetna — have said they were losing money by participating. Among plans offered on the exchanges, costs have gone way up. Looking at a standard measurement used by the Department of Health and Human Services — what a family of four with a household income of $60,000 would pay for premiums on the second-lowest-cost silver plan — average premiums for this type of plan rose by 38 percent between 2014 and 2017. ""Of course, everyone would like to see more competition in the marketplaces — that's important for keeping costs down,"" said Sherry Glied, dean of New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. ""But there has always been a recognition that there would be more competition in some places than others."" Glied added that individual insurance markets in many states were highly concentrated before the Affordable Care Act, too. Our ruling Trump said, ""One-third of the counties — think of it, one-third — only have one insurer left."" As long as you know that Trump is specifically talking about Affordable Care Act exchanges, Trump’s figure checks out. People trying to purchase insurance on a government exchange only have one provider to choose from in 32 percent of the nation’s counties, according to late 2016 data from Kaiser. That means 21 percent of Affordable Care Act enrollees, or about 1.9 million people in 2017, can only pick from one health insurance provider.

Ellison says travel ban will hurt Somalis fleeing famine
","The second in command at the Democratic National Committee, Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., called President Donald Trump’s revised travel ban inhumane and cruel, and particularly hurtful to an immigrant community he knows well. ""In Minneapolis, we are proud of our Somalia-American community,"" Ellison said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on March 7. ""Somalia is going through a drought and a famine. They could be banned from getting relief through coming to the United States because of this ban."" Under Trump’s latest executive order, refugee processing for people from six nations including Somalia is on hold for four months. The order caps the total number of refugees at 50,000 for the year, a cut of about half from what the Obama administration had planned. No new immigration visas will be issued for three months. So Ellison is right that Somalis can be banned from entering the country. But discussion of drought and famine is misplaced. Somalis can't apply for refugee status because of famine, said Mark Hetfield, president of the refugee assistance organization HIAS. ""Before the ban, there was no U.S. immigration or refugee program which assists victims of humanitarian disasters like famine, so the ban itself will not hinder U.S. relief efforts,"" Hetfield said. ""The refugee program is only for individuals with a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group -- not a well founded fear of famine."" Kathleen Newland, a senior specialist on refugee issues at the Migration Policy Institute, agreed. Trump's travel ban does not affect a famine response. ""The U.S. response to famine in any location would not be to move people to the United States, but to help them where they are,"" Newland said. ""I can’t see how the travel ban would affect relief efforts in and around Somalia."" The head of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees Filippo Grandi criticized the travel ban in general terms. ""We are concerned that this decision, though temporary, may compound the anguish for those it affects,"" Grandi said the day the latest executive order was signed. About 15,000 Somalis live in refugee camps in Kenya. Paul Spiegel, a researcher at the Center for Refugee and Disaster Response at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, said both war and drought have swelled the numbers at refugee camps. ""Some of these refugees could be resettled to the United States and other countries,"" Spiegel said. ""Although a rather small amount compared to the number of people affected by the famine, every life counts."" Ellison’s spokesman Brett Morrow also noted that the United Nations estimates that about 6 million Somalis need food aid. The freeze on visa and refugee processing blocks people from getting out, which puts additional strain on already stretched humanitarian efforts. Our ruling Ellison said that people threatened by famine in Somalia could be banned from getting relief through coming to the United States due to Trump administration visa and refugee restrictions. The problem with this claim is that the famine has little to no bearing on Somali refugee status. Somalis can't apply for refugee status because of famine or drought, experts say.  Ellison's statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Did a ShopRite owner say the Philly soda tax would mean layoffs in his stores?
","Philadelphia soda distributors and supermarkets have said the beverage tax that went into effect Jan. 1 has caused significant decreases in beverage and total sales, forcing them to either drastically cut hours or lay off employees. Pepsi recently announced its plans to lay off up to 100 employees over three distribution plants within the city after experiencing a 40 percent dip in sales apparently from the new tax, and Canada Dry Delaware Valley also blamed recent months’ low sales for new layoffs. But the most significant reaction so far comes from Jeffrey Brown, owner of six ShopRite stores in Philadelphia and 10 in the Delaware Valley, who told Philly.com last month that he expected to lose about 300 employees ""voluntarily and through layoffs"" this spring. Two days after the article was published, though, on Fox 29, he ditched the part about layoffs and said he expects some attrition as his stores are forced to cut hours. ""There will be some attrition, what happens when people don’t get enough hours, we’re unionized, so it goes by seniority, so when the new people, people that have been with us for like less than a year they get their hours cut. And when it gets cut beyond a certain point it’s not really worth their while to have the job and they start looking for other employment and the ones that don’t, we have to balance the numbers overtime,"" he told Fox 29. It wasn’t clear in that interview whether Brown had just forgotten to mention the layoffs he previously claimed were coming, or if he purposely steered in a different direction. But, in a follow up Philly.com article published Feb. 23, he referenced layoffs again, saying, ""There’s no way of knowing the layoff number, but 280, 300 jobs will be gone one way or the other. If a person quits or goes on unemployment, or I lay them off, the jobs will be gone."" The city has insisted businesses have been overreacting in their opposition to the tax, noting that the American Beverage Association last year spent over a million dollars in advertisements opposing Mayor Kenney’s plan to tax sugary beverages to pay for Philadelphia children to attend pre-K. Kenney's spokesperson, Lauren Hitt, noted, ""Brown is part of the same industry that spent ten million dollars and made plenty of misleading claims trying to kill the tax last year."" She also said via e-mail: ""We feel that Philadelphians should be skeptical of any unverifiable numbers that Brown or any other members of the soda industry put out."" Marc Stier, Director of the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, is also skeptical of Brown's claim that there's been a 40 to 50 percent drop in ShopRite's beverage sales, and a 15 percent dip in overall sales. He said he doubts the drop in beverage sales could account for that high a level of overall losses, referencing Progressive Grocer's 2016 Annual Consumers Expenditure Study that shows soda makes up only four percent of nationwide grocery store sales. But John Stanton, a St. Joe’s professor who’s specialized in food marketing for decades, asserts that Brown's numbers make sense. He said it's unlikely shoppers will substitute their sugary beverages with healthier options. ""I just think that’s kind of a ridiculous conclusion to draw,"" he said, ""Now, is it possible that someone is going to say, ‘Let’s buy just two liters of coke?’ It’s not like they’re going to say, ‘Let’s buy fresh carrots with the money we’re going to save,' because the two liters of coke taxed are going to cost as much as the three liters of coke untaxed, so it’s not like they have a lot of extra money."" He also says the beverage section is, in general, the most important section for a supermarket. Stores usually display soda and drink products in several areas throughout the store. Their sales tend to make up a large amount of total sales revenue. And, aside from the profit made when shoppers buy the product, supermarkets also make revenue through promotional allowances. That’s when a distributor (say, Pepsi) pays the store to display its product on an end cap, which is the small, outward facing section on the end of an isle. If shoppers at a supermarket start buying less Pepsi, Pepsi gives the supermarket less money in promotional allowances. So, by selling less of a product like Pepsi, the store not only loses sales revenue, but it sacrifices even more revenue from lost promotional allowances. Soda is generally a common product displayed on end caps and thus often contributes to a store's promotional revenue. ""Supermarkets rely on these promotional payments,"" Stanton said. Karen Meleta, a spokesperson for Brown, emphasized that the stores aren't only selling less soda, but they're also selling less of other products the tax covers: some sugary syrups and dairy alternatives like cashew and almond milk. ""If all people just stopped buying Coke and Pepsi, we probably would have been fine,"" she said. But, because of the variety of products now taxed, she said the ShopRite stores are losing thousands of customers to stores outside the city, where the same products are now less expensive. Kenney has insisted sales will rebound to normal levels in time, citing examples from tobacco and liquor taxes, but Stanton objects to that claim, too. He said shoppers are habitual. Once they create a routine, they tend to stick to it. ""I have a feeling [Kenney's] not a very good food marketer,"" he said. And Meleta said though she doesn't know whether sales for beverages not included in the soda tax have increased, if they have, it hasn't leveled out the overall losses. This all explains how the tax may contribute to revenue loss, but what about the discrepancy between layoffs and attrition? Though Brown did mention the possibility of layoffs, Meleta said no employees have been laid off. However, there has been up to a 6,000 hour reduction, and up to 300 employees have since left voluntarily, she said. Stanton said this is a reasonable result of significant decreases in beverage sales. He explained supermarket budgets are driven by revenue. If revenue goes down, there’s very little supermarkets can do other than cut hours. Ultimately, it’s up to management to decide how to distribute hours, whether to decrease hours for a large number of employees or to let some people go in order to pay others a ""livable wage."" ""To me, cutting people’s hours and letting people go, they’re the same thing,"" Stanton added. Our Ruling What we're judging here isn't the possibility of the beverage tax costing ShopRite stores 15 percent of their total sales or whether that necessitates substantially cutting hours. We're just checking to see if Brown has remained consistent in his explanation of how he is losing employees. Though Brown has distanced himself from his early use of the word ""layoff,"" a Philly.com article from Feb. 23 directly quotes him using it. He never definitively said layoffs were going to happen, but he mentioned the possibility. And on Fox 29, he didn’t deny the possibility of layoffs, he just didn’t use that word. In both cases his explanation was ambiguous. However, when we reached out to Brown to clarify his statements, a spokeswoman for him, Karen Meleta, said he had not made any reference to possibly laying off employees, and that there have been no layoffs to date. So, even if the tax is responsible for reduced profits in Brown's supermarket, causing him to have to cut hours and lose employees, he has clearly been inconsistent in citing layoffs or attrition. We rate the claim a Half-Flip.",/factchecks/2017/mar/13/jeffrey-brown/did-shoprite-owner-say-philly-soda-tax-would-mean-/

Would 'Trumpcare,' the GOP replacement for Obamacare, allow insurance executives to 'make millions'?
","U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin greeted the Obamacare replacement bill -- she calls it ""Trumpcare"" -- with a sharp retort. This was the Wisconsin Democrat’s tweet on March 8, 2017, two days after the unveiling of the the House GOP bill: #ReadtheBill & you’ll see #TrumpCare would allow insurance execs to personally make millions off your health care. To be sure, the top executives at five major insurers -- Aetna, Cigna, UnitedHealth, Anthem and Humana -- already make millions, with each CEO earning between $10.3 million and $17.3 million in 2015, according to the latest figures. Could the CEOs make millions more as a result of the GOP bill? There would be an opportunity for that: A proposed tax break in the bill connected to executive compensation would be worth millions of dollars to the health insurers. But the tax break would go to corporations, not personally to the executives. And Baldwin’s claim assumes the corporations would give millions of dollars in raises to the executives. A tax deduction change Baldwin’s attack centers on a provision of the bill, which is supported by President Donald Trump, that would change a tax deduction: Currently, Obamacare limits to $500,000 the amount of an individual executive's compensation that a health insurance company can deduct as a business expense. The aim, as U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., has noted was to prevent health insurers from passing along profits they made via Obamacare to their executives, and then deducting the cost of those raises on the company’s taxes. The GOP replacement bill would repeal the $500,000 limit, generally making the cap $1 million, the same amount that applies to other types of businesses. In other words, health insurance companies could increase their tax deduction. The upshot for the federal government, as estimated by Congress’ nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation: $400 million in lost tax revenue over 10 years. The effects So, as Baldwin suggests, the GOP proposal would allow health insurers to claim a greater tax deduction for the pay it gives its top executives. A CNN/Money news report said that of the $73 million paid to the CEOs of the five major insurers in 2015, only $2.5 million was deductible under Obamacare tax laws, but more than $70 million of it would be deductible under the Republican legislation. But there are other important facts to consider: It’s misleading to say that executives would ""personally"" benefit from the change, given that the tax break is for corporations, not individuals. The health insurance companies would have more of a financial incentive, in terms of tax deductions, to give raises to their executives. But even if the companies opted to provide bigger raises, there’s no evidence that the executives would reap ""millions."" As Matthew Gardner, senior fellow at the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told us: ""A more accurate version of Baldwin’s statement would be that Trumpcare would make it easier for insurance companies to increase their CEO’s pay."" Our rating Baldwin says ""‘Trumpcare’ would allow insurance execs to personally make millions off your health care."" One provision in a Trump-supported Republican bill to replace Obamacare is a tax break worth an estimated $400 million over 10 years. It’s possible that money could fund raises for health care company executives. But the tax break is for the companies, not individuals; the companies could use the savings for other purposes; and even if the savings were used for raises, there’s no evidence that executives would get millions. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/mar/13/tammy-baldwin/would-trumpcare-gop-replacement-obamacare-allow-in/

Tom Price undercounts Obamacare impact on getting more Americans insured
","Republicans supporting the House GOP’s effort to repeal and replace Obamacare are pushing back on criticism that the plan would strip health insurance away from an estimated 6 million to 15 million Americans. In comments on the Sunday shows March 12, surrogates for President Donald Trump drew a distinction between being insured and being able to access affordable health care. Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price also made the case that the number of new people insured as a result of Obamacare can be overstated. ""The number of individuals who actually got coverage through the exchange who didn't have coverage before, or who weren't eligible for Medicaid before is relatively small,"" Price said on Meet the Press. ""So we've turned things upside down completely for 3 million, or 4 million, or 5 million individuals."" Is that correct? The passage of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, did result in a spate of Medicaid enrollees who were previously eligible for the program (about 3.2 million). But beyond that, Price’s claim falls apart.  3 million to 5 million new enrollees? No Price focused on two pools of people -- those who benefited from the plan to expand Medicaid and uninsured Americans who purchased coverage through a federal or state exchange or marketplace. Through that lens, Price’s figures are off. Nonpartisan health care analysts at the Kaiser Family Foundation have concluded that, as of March 2016, more than 11 million Americans have gained access to health care as part of the Medicaid expansion. As we noted, an additional 3.2 million Americans signed up for Medicaid but were previously eligible. Finding data on the number of previously uninsured people who signed up for care through a health care exchange is more challenging. But the numbers that do exist further undercut Price. In 2015, researchers at the nonpartisan RAND Corporation estimated that 4.1 million previously uninsured Americans had gained access through a health care exchange or marketplace. That’s roughly 15 million Americans who weren’t insured who now are, which is three to five times the number Price used. Sherry A. Glied, dean of the Robert F. Wagner School of Public Service at New York University, recently examined how much of a factor the Affordable Care Act is playing in cutting the uninsured rate. Looking at the Affordable Care Act’s first open enrollment period (2013-14), Glied concluded that the health care law explained about 76 percent of the decline in the uninsured rate. Glied told us that translates to 9.8 million more people covered as a result of the health care law’s policies in 2014. ""Since then, the uninsurance rate has dropped further,"" Glied said, which would mean the pool of people covered because of Affordable Care Act policies has grown. That Medicaid expansion figure could be bigger It’s important to note that the health care law actually was designed so that even more people would receive health care through the Medicaid expansion. Historically, Medicaid coverage had been focused primarily on pregnant women, children and the disabled. Under the Affordable Care Act, eligibility was to be expanded to nearly all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. As part of the law, the federal government agreed to cover 100 percent of the cost of newly eligible people through 2016, 95 percent in 2017, 94 percent in 2018, 93 percent in 2019, and 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. The original plan was that every state would expand the program, but a 2012 Supreme Court decision allowed each state to decide for itself. To date, 19 states have refused to expand Medicaid eligibility -- creating a gap in coverage. How big is the gap? Kaiser estimates an additional 2.5 million people were intended to get health care as part of the Affordable Care Act but have not. What Price didn’t mention about the ACA The Affordable Care Act included another provision to cover people who previously might be uninsured. The Department of Health and Human Services estimated in 2016 that 2.3 million young adults gained health care from 2010 to October 2013 as a result of a provision of the law that allows people under age 26 to stay on a parent’s plan. The House GOP proposal retains that specific provision. Our ruling Price said, ""The number of individuals who actually got coverage through the exchange who didn't have coverage before, or who weren't eligible for Medicaid before is relatively small. So we've turned things upside down completely for 3 million, or 4 million, or 5 million individuals."" Price is understating the impact of the law on providing health insurance to the previously uninsured. The proposal to expand Medicaid alone has provided health insurance to more than 11 million Americans. We rate this statement False.   UPDATE March 12, 4:30 p.m. ET: A spokesman for Price's office responded after we published this item and cited the RAND study we referenced, as well as others, that look at the number of previously uninsured people who purchased insurance through the marketplace. Our rating remains False.",/factchecks/2017/mar/12/tom-price/tom-price-undercounts-obamacare-impact-getting-mor/
