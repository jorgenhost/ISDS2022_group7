Obama setting debt record, Georgia GOP says
","
Georgia Republican Party leaders are actively trying to make the case that President Barack Obama is not a good steward of the nation’s checkbook.

One recent post on the party’s website caused our Truth-O-Meter to light up.

""It is clear that America could not afford the first four years of Barack Obama’s presidency, let alone the unimaginable economic nightmare that would surely be his second term,"" the party wrote. ""In fact, at his current rate, President Obama will have added more debt to the United States of America by the end of his first term than each of the previous 43 presidents -- combined!""

The party even has an ""Obama Debt Watch"" digital tote board on its website.

Several Republican leaders have made similar claims, which have been fact-checked by our colleagues at our national PolitiFact office. The rulings have varied because the statements have been slightly different in each case.

Let’s start with the basics concerning this particular claim. There are two ways to measure the national debt: the amount held by the public debt and the gross federal debt. The public debt includes all debt borrowed by the federal government and held by investors through Treasury notes and other securities. The gross federal debt includes public debt plus debt held by the government. The most notable forms of debt held by the government are the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare, money which is owed to beneficiaries in the future.

Georgia GOP spokesman Chris Kelleher said the state party was measuring the federal debt held by the public, starting at the time Obama was sworn in as president on Jan. 20, 2009.

On that January day, the debt held by the public was $6.3 trillion, according to U.S. Treasury Department data. Three years later, the total was nearly $10.5 trillion. In August, after much debate, Congress approved and Obama signed a debt deal that allowed the federal government to raise its debt ceiling by more than $2 trillion but requires a similar amount in budget cuts over the next decade.

The federal government manages its finances on a 12-month fiscal year schedule that begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. We are currently in fiscal year 2012.

The White House’s Office of Management and Budget estimates that the debt held by the public will be about $12.8 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2013. The Congressional Budget Office has a slightly more conservative estimate of just under $12 trillion.

Using the White House numbers means the debt will have risen by about $6.5 trillion since Obama took office, which is greater than the $6.3 trillion debt estimate when he became commander-in-chief. Using the CBO numbers, the increase since Obama took office will be about $5.7 trillion, which is less than the amount it was on Jan. 20, 2009.

So which 2013 estimate should we use?

We interviewed two experts on such matters. Jason Peuquet, the research director for the  Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said he prefers to go with the OMB numbers. Georgia State University professor Katherine Willoughby, an expert in government budgets, said she prefers to use the CBO’s figures. Both, however, disagreed with the Georgia GOP’s process to base its claim. They say it’s more accurate to measure debt as a share of the nation’s gross domestic product.

Peuquet said that statistic is preferable because it is a better historic measure of debt and the economy.

""Dollars today are [worth] a lot less than they were 200 years ago,"" he said. ""So [the Georgia GOP comparison] is not an apples-to-apples comparison.""

In fiscal year 2009, the public debt as a share of the nation’s gross domestic product was about 53 percent, according to OMB and CBO figures. By the end of fiscal year 2013, both organizations estimate it will be 75.1 percent. The difference between those four years is not more than America’s first 43 presidents combined.

PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether it was fair for the party to put this all on Obama when Congress approved the August 2011 debt deal?

""In the American democracy, there are split powers,"" Peuquet said. ""Congress has played a big part in tax cuts and spending increases in the past.""

Said Willoughby: ""My take on this would be that the statement is partially true. Certainly, our debt has soared in light of the Great Recession. To be fair to Obama, though, it would be better to consider debt held by the public as a percent of gross domestic product.""

Willoughby noted that the public debt as a share of the nation’s GDP rose to dangerously similar levels during World War II. It went from 47 percent in 1942 to 106.2 percent by 1945, according to OMB data.

Georgia Republican Party spokesman Chris Kelleher said responsibility for the debt increases solely belong to the president. He said congressional Republicans were forced to go along or face a government shutdown.

""The fact of the matter is that the request for the increase in the debt ceiling -- which directly allowed our government to continue writing bad checks and adding to our public share of the debt -- came directly from President Obama. The blame lies squarely at his feet; for Barack Obama, the buck stops nowhere,"" Kelleher told us via email.

Our conclusion:

There are two factors to consider here. One, has the public debt risen under Obama’s presidency more than all of his predecessors combined? Two, is this all Obama’s fault?

The Georgia GOP’s rationale for its claim is based on using the raw totals reported by the OMB. There are other factors to consider, however, when examining the accuracy of this statement, such as measuring the debt increase by the nation’s gross domestic product. There, the GOP claim is in trouble.

As for whether Obama bears all of the blame here, Congress, which has a Republican-controlled House of Representatives, passed the 2011 debt deal and is partly responsible for the projected increase by fiscal year 2013.

With these caveats, we rate this claim as Half True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/13/GaGOP/obama-setting-debt-record-georgia-gop-says/

Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch says Kathleen Falk raised taxes by millions every year as Dane County executive
","
Democrat Kathleen Falk’s bid to knock Gov. Scott Walker out in a likely recall election is subjecting her 14-year tenure as Dane County executive to attacks by Republicans.

Led by Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, they are labeling Falk a classic Madison tax-and-spend liberal -- one out of step with the times.

""In a national economic downturn, Wisconsin families cannot afford to have a leader with an addiction to taxing and spending,"" Kleefisch wrote in an opinion piece published by Madison’s Capital Times on Feb. 3, 2012. ""The failed policies Falk has consistently stood for throughout her career are exactly the same policies that led Wisconsin down an irresponsible path to a $3.6 billion budget deficit.""

Kleefisch went on to cite chapter and verse:

""As Dane County executive, Falk raised taxes by millions of dollars every year, most notably in 2010, when she increased taxes by 8 percent, the second highest increase across the entire state of Wisconsin.""

The op-ed piece contrasts these claims with Walker’s state budget, which Kleefisch says was balanced ""without raising taxes on Wisconsin families.""

We’ve labeled inaccurate, multiple times, the GOP claim that Walker didn’t raise taxes. He came close, and he cut taxes more than he raised them in his budget overall, but he reduced tax credits for some lower-income working people, which the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau has scored as tax increases.

Asked to back up the claim about Falk, the Walker campaign -- speaking for Kleefisch -- pointed us to property tax figures compiled by Dane County and the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a nonpartisan research group. 
Falk’s approach as executive from 1997 to 2011 was to limit increases in the property tax levy to inflation with a factor built in for population growth. It was an effort to tie increases to service demand, said Scott McDonell, chairman of the Dane County Board, which largely approved of Falk’s approach. 
Did Falk’s budget raise property taxes by 8 percent in 2010, ""the second highest"" in the state? Yes.

In 2010, Falk busted past her self-imposed levy limit of 1.19 percent for that year. She blamed lagging sales tax and other revenue due to the Great Recession, and said higher property taxes, a 3 percent wage cut negotiated with county unions and efficiency moves would preserve needed services.

""I’ll be the first to say I’m not one bit comfortable with this levy increase, but using the formula would have resulted in painful cuts to public safety and human services that are unacceptable to me,"" Falk said at the time.

The 8 percent hike was second-highest behind Green County.

Did Falk’s budgets raise the levy by ""millions"" every year?

We analyzed the data and found that in Dane County, the property tax levy went up in a range from $2 million to $9 million every year. That’s in the neighborhood of 3 percent to 5 percent increases annually -- with the exception of 2010.

So the ""millions"" every year is accurate, though it’s worth pointing out that Dane County is nearly a half-billion-a-year operation supported by $133 million in tax levy -- so it doesn’t take a big percentage increase to get to ""millions"" of new property taxes in a year.

Falk’s campaign defends her budget record, saying her property tax ""cap"" was landmark. She, like Walker, touts the fact that she balanced budgets, though both were legally bound to do so.

The numbers showed Falk’s self-imposed limits held down property tax increases to the point that only 15 counties had a lower cumulative tax levy increase during that time, we found. Dane County ranked 57th among 72 counties, with 72 being the lowest levy increase.

By comparison, under then-County Executive Walker, Milwaukee County was fifth-lowest (68th ranked) from 2002 to 2011.

So both were in the bottom 20 percent of tax raisers, with Milwaukee County close to the champion of frugality.

Indeed, both counties raised property taxes: Dane’s levy went up $59 million in Falk’s 14 years, while Milwaukee’s rose $51 million over Walker’s nine years.

The difference: While Falk and the board gave themselves a cap on growth, Walker proposed zero tax levy increases each year and vetoed attempts to add to the levy. But the County Board almost always overrode him, complaining his budgets were unrealistic.

To be sure, Walker started each budget with the new, higher base. In effect, he used the new taxes he opposed one year to help his budget for the next year. So if you compare the tax levy he sought in his first budget to that in his last, it is up.

Our conclusion

Kleefisch takes on Falk’s record of consistent property tax levy increases.

While we found Dane County on the low side for tax hikes during Falk’s 14 years, Kleefisch’s main point is that taxes went up every year under Falk, and spiked one year. They did.

Chris Christie claims under Greg Schiano, Rutgers football had the best graduation rate in its division
","
Greg Schiano has his detractors in New Jersey, but Gov. Chris Christie isn’t one of them.

The governor defended the football coach, who recently left Rutgers University to become head coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in a Jan. 31 radio interview. Despite criticism about Schiano’s 11-year tenure with the Scarlet Knights, Christie said the coach transformed the program from a ""laughingstock"" into a fierce competitor -- and in more than just athletics.

""Here's something that people never talk about with coach Schiano: Rutgers had the best graduation rate of any Division I football program in America. Now, when all you see is scandal all over college football, in 11 years you never saw it touch Rutgers. Not once,"" Christie said on New Jersey 101.5’s ""Ask the Governor"" program.  ""And he graduated his kids from college, so those kids if they went on to the NFL like some of the folks who have gone on to the NFL and done really well, great. But the majority of them don't and for the majority who don't, he got them out of Rutgers with a Rutgers degree and I tell you, I bet you the parents of those kids love Greg Schiano because those kids now have a future because they have a college degree from a great university like Rutgers.""

There’s a reason people don’t talk about Rutgers’ football team earning the top graduation rate in its division: it never did.

There are 120 teams playing in the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s Football Bowl Subdivision, formerly known as Division I-A.

Rutgers’ Scarlet Knights play in the division’s Big East Conference with seven other teams. The most recent data available on graduation success rates, which are calculated by the NCAA, ranks Rutgers at the top of its conference, but not the top of its division.

Among Football Bowl Subdivision teams, Notre Dame, Northwestern University, Rice University, Boston College, Duke University and the U.S. Naval Academy had higher graduation success rates than Rutgers.

Rutgers never topped its division in graduation rates under Schiano, but it’s worth noting that in  five years, the team’s NCAA graduation rate climbed from 55 percent to 89 percent.

The governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment, but a spokesman for the Rutgers football program said: ""I would think he was referring to our APR, which he has commented on before.""

The APR, or academic progress rate, is another measure of academic performance based on whether a student-athlete remains academically eligible and remains with the school.

Emily Potter, a NCAA spokeswoman, said in an email that the academic progress rate is ""intended to be predictive of eventual graduation rates. Both should be important measures of academic success, and the higher that one of these measures is, the more likely it is that the other will also be high.""

But, ""having said that, it is true that graduation is not included in the actual measurement of APR.""

Rutgers grabbed the top spot in its division by that measure two years ago. Last year, Rutgers fell to the second spot in the academic progress rate rankings, behind Northwestern University in Illinois.

David Ridpath, an assistant professor of sports administration at Ohio University, said in an email that ""Governor Christie is incorrect, but probably not intentional on his part—still he should be more careful with his absolute statements.""

Our ruling

Christie claimed that ""Rutgers had the best graduation rate of any Division I football program in America.""

The Scarlet Knights ranked at the top of their conference, but not the top of their division for graduation rates in the most recent data. During Schiano’s tenure, the team never had the best graduation rate in the division. By another measure of academic performance, Rutgers football topped its division, but, according to a NCAA spokeswoman, graduation is not included in that calculation.

We rate the statement False.

Newt Gingrich says judge said he'd jail Texas superintendent if orders on graduation prayer violated
","Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich has his eye on a U.S. district judge in San Antonio. Gingrich has mentioned Fred Biery on the stump when arguing that the legislative and executive branches of government should remove judges perceived as abusing their power and acting out of sync with the nation’s culture. On Jan. 21, 2012, after winning the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, Gingrich again referenced Biery, urging voters to check out a position paper on his campaign website about ""the balance of power, putting the judiciary back in its proper role and eliminating dictatorial religious bigots such as Judge Biery in San Antonio, who issued a ruling that … not only could the students not pray at their graduation, if they used the word ‘benediction,’ the word ‘invocation,’ the word ‘God,’ asked the audience to stand or asked for a moment of silence, he would put the superintendent in jail."" A reader alerted us to Gingrich’s talk of Biery after the candidate mentioned the judge during a Dec. 18, 2011, appearance on the CBS News show Face the Nation. For this article, we’re checking the accuracy of the candidate’s description of Biery’s order during his South Carolina speech. We’re not going to delve into whether Biery is a ""dictatorial religious bigot"" — that’s Gingrich’s opinion — or whether his decision on prayer at graduation is an example of the judiciary overstepping its role. The case Taking Gingrich’s suggestion in his victory speech, we checked out the 54-page paper on his website, ""Bringing the Courts Back Under the Constitution."" Its Appendix B is devoted to Biery, chief judge of the federal Western District of Texas, and is headlined: ""Federal district court judge orders the censoring of high school graduation speech."" At issue: A June 1, 2011, order from Biery granting an agnostic family’s request for a temporary order prohibiting the 3,000-student Medina Valley school district, west of San Antonio, from including a prayer in its high school’s then-pending graduation ceremony. Gingrich spokesman Joe DeSantis pointed out the order when we asked for the backup for Gingrich’s victory-speech statement. In a May 26, 2011, lawsuit, the family challenged Medina Valley High School’s tradition of having students deliver an invocation and benediction as part of the graduation, a practice that the family said amounted to unconstitutional school-sponsored prayer. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of the family by the Washington-based Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said Christa and Danny Schultz were exposed to the ""unwelcome prayers"" at the high school’s 2009 ceremony, when their oldest child graduated. The couple’s younger son was in the 2011 graduating class. The lawsuit said: ""If the Schultzes were to attend the graduation of their son, they would once again be exposed to the school district’s longstanding practice of presenting prayers as part of graduation ceremonies"" unless the court stopped it. The lawsuit alleged that the graduation prayers violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment — ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion"" — and included a request that the judge issue an emergency order prohibiting the district ""from including any prayer … whether denominated an ‘invocation,’ ‘benediction,’ or otherwise"" at the graduation on June 4, 2011. During a May 31, 2011, hearing on the request, Craig Wood, a lawyer representing the school district, argued that with respect to the graduation speeches, the district was adhering to a 2007 state law that Wood said was enacted ""to honor the fact that students do sometimes wish to express religious viewpoints and ought not be penalized for doing so."" Wood was referring to the Texas Religious Viewpoints Anti-discrimination Act, which requires each school district to adopt a policy enabling student speakers at school events, including graduation ceremonies, to voluntarily express a religious viewpoint. At graduations, the law says, districts must ""state, in writing, orally, or both, that the student's speech does not reflect the endorsement, sponsorship, position, or expression of the district."" ""We're attempting to balance those First Amendment interests of all parties involved,"" Wood told Biery. ""And I will acknowledge, your honor, in a community like Medina Valley, it is not unusual for there to be a student selected (to speak at graduation) who would, in fact, make some sort of reference to some sort of religious deity. I will also tell you that in the last couple of years that the closing remarks made by the student had no religious connotation whatsoever."" By the end of the hearing, Biery had made it clear that he planned to grant the Schultzes’ request, articulating in court essentially what appeared the following day in his injunction. Ayesha Khan, legal director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, who represented the family at the hearing, requested that Biery’s order specify that the students’ remarks could not include a prayer. ""Well, I will put that in there: It’s not to be a prayer,"" Biery said. ""On the other hand, if these young ladies get up and say the same thing without invoking a deity, or they make a personal statement: I believe, myself, in a higher being, like I think Mr. Wood used that phrase. And they can make a personal statement of their own belief. I think that's certainly acceptable."" The order Biery’s order, dated June 1, says the district and ""its officials, agents, servants, and employees, as well as all persons acting in concert with them, are prohibited from allowing a prayer (as defined in paragraph (b) below) to be included"" in the ceremony. Paragraph b mandates that: ** the district instruct the students chosen to deliver the ""invocation"" and ""benediction"" to change their remarks to be ""statements of their own beliefs as opposed to leading the audience in prayer."" ** everyone scheduled to speak at the graduation be instructed not to present a prayer, ""to wit, they shall be instructed that they may not ask audience members to ‘stand,’ ‘join in prayer,’ or ‘bow their heads,’ they may not end their remarks with ‘amen’ or ‘in [a deity’s name] we pray,’ and they shall not otherwise deliver a message that would commonly be understood to be a prayer, nor use the word ‘prayer’ unless it is used in the student’s expression of the student’s personal belief, as opposed to encouraging others who may not believe in the concept of prayer to join in and believe the same concept."" At the end of paragraph B, Biery says that ""in stating their own personal beliefs,"" students may ""speak through conduct such as kneeling to face Mecca, the wearing of a yarmulke or hijab or making the sign of the cross."" Also in the order, Biery says that the district must remove the terms ""invocation"" and ""benediction"" from the ""program of ceremonies for the graduation exercises"" and that they are to be replaced with ""opening remarks"" and ""closing remarks."" Finally, the order says the injunction goes into effect immediately and ""shall be enforced by incarceration or other sanctions for contempt of court if not obeyed by district official(s) and their agents."" The fact-check So how does Gingrich’s statement describing Biery’s order stand up? Let’s break it down: ** Gingrich’s first claim — that the judge’s order said students could not pray at their graduation — has a basis. The order prohibits student speakers from leading the audience in prayer or delivering ""a message that would commonly be understood to be a prayer."" Then again, Biery’s order allows the students to talk about their personal beliefs and use the word ""prayer"" in that context. ** Next, Gingrich says Biery banned the words ""benediction"" and ""invocation"" from being spoken. That’s pretty close. Although the order did not specifically prohibit students from uttering ""benediction"" and ""invocation,"" the district was told to banish the terms from the paper program. And Biery said at the pivotal hearing that ""there will be no words ‘invocation,’ ‘benediction’ in the ceremony."" ** Gingrich says ""God"" was also not to be mentioned during graduation speeches. That seems like a reach since Biery’s order has only one curb on mentions of God; it bars speakers from using the phrase ""in God’s name we pray."" ** Also prohibited, according to Gingrich: asking the audience to stand or asking for a moment of silence. In fact, the order says speakers cannot ask the audience to "" ‘stand,’ ‘join in prayer’ or ‘bow their heads’ "" — actions that often precede organized prayer. The order does not mention moments of silence. ** Finally, Gingrich says that Biery’s order says the district’s superintendent would go to jail if the boundaries set by the injunction were crossed. That appears to be an overstatement in that the order says it ""shall be enforced by incarceration or other sanctions."" That is, punishments short of going to jail were possible. In a July 3, 2011, news article about the case, the San Antonio Express-News reported that Biery’s order said ""school administrators could be jailed if they didn’t comply."" We consulted two legal experts about the wording of that section of Biery’s order. Charles Silver, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, told us: ""It’s possible for someone who has violated a court order to be put in jail, but it would be unusual for that to happen. It would be much more likely for the punishment to involve a fine."" Mechele Dickerson, a UT law professor who teaches civil procedure, agreed that the most likely punishment for a violation of Biery’s order would have been a fine for the district. Also, she said, had the judge wanted to jail someone, the order’s language doesn’t necessitate that the person be the superintendent — unlike what Gingrich said. The punished person could be another ""agent"" of the district — the high school’s principal, for example — Dickerson said. Silver and Dickerson each said the punishment section of the order was fairly common. Silver said: ""It’s pretty much boilerplate language. The function is really to put people on notice: ‘Hey, the court means this.’ "" Each professor also noted that if the order was violated in some way, procedural steps would have to take place before anyone was punished. First, the plaintiffs in the case — the Schultz family — would have to file a motion with the court; and then a hearing would be held so that the judge could decide whether someone — possibly the superintendent — was in contempt. If so, the judge would then decide on punishment. Biery declined our request for an interview. In a telephone interview, Wood, the district’s lawyer, generally supported the views of Silver and Dickerson and said he thought Gingrich’s statement about Biery’s order wasn’t quite right. He agreed that the order’s language about the possible sanctions was standard and was informing the district that ""a violation was enforceable vis a vis the regular methods."" The sanctions imposed by the judge would most likely have depended upon the circumstances of the violation, Wood said, such as who had done it and ""the degree to which they thumbed their nose at the order."" The rest of the story Biery’s order survived for two days. On June 2, 2011, the district asked the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans to dissolve Biery’s order barring the students from praying at the graduation, arguing that the court had abused its discretion, that the district had not violated the Establishment Clause and that the injunction had violated the graduation speakers’ ""free speech and free exercise of religion rights as well as state law."" The Texas attorney general’s office announced that it had filed a brief with the appeals court supporting the district’s appeal. On June 3, a three-judge panel of the appeals court vacated the injunction, saying that they were ""not persuaded that plaintiffs have shown that they are substantially likely to prevail on the merits, particularly on the issue that the individual prayers or other remarks to be given by students at graduation are, in fact, school-sponsored."" The judges also said the Schultzes’ request for an injunction ""may be rooted at least in part in circumstances that no longer exist,"" pointing to the statement in the district’s appeal that it had agreed not to include the words ""invocation"" and ""benediction"" in the graduation program distributed at the event. The panel sent the case — which included more than simply the injunction request — back to the district court, and on Feb. 9, 2012, it was settled. On the issue of speeches at graduation, the settlement says the district will not include a prayer as part of the official program or invite nonstudent speakers that it ""has reason to believe will proselytize, promote religion, or disparage the religious beliefs (or lack thereof) of students or members of the community during their remarks."" Student speakers will, however, be allowed to pray or ask the audience to join them in prayer. For its part, Wood said, the district agreed to honor ""the students’ right to free expression whether it be religious or otherwise, taking careful steps to clarify that it’s not the district’s speech or sponsorship."" For example, if a student leads a prayer at the ceremony, district officials must remain seated. Our ruling To recap, Gingrich’s claim is that Biery ""issued a ruling that … not only could the students not pray at their graduation, if they used the word ‘benediction,’ the word ‘invocation,’ the word ‘God,’ asked the audience to stand or asked for a moment of silence, he would put the superintendent in jail."" The judge’s ruling did not broadly say students could not pray. However, his order prohibited students speaking at the graduation from leading the audience in prayer or delivering ""a message that would commonly be understood to be a prayer."" Gingrich is close on this part. Also, the judge told the district to banish ""benediction"" and ""invocation"" from the event. The rest of Gingrich’s claim, including its crescendo reference to putting the superintendent in jail, has weaknesses. The order did not bar ""God"" from any mention during the ceremony, only ruling out the phrase ""in God’s name we pray."" The judge’s order barred students from asking the audience to stand, presumably in preparation for organized prayer, but it did not forbid a moment of silence. The punch line of Gingrich’s primary-night claim — that the Texas order said the superintendent would be jailed if his ruling was violated — overstates things. The order lists incarceration or ""other sanctions"" as possible penalties, though nothing as a certainty, and doesn’t specify the superintendent as potential inmate. Also, the punishment language appears to have been standard.

Rhode Island Right to Life executive director Barth Bracy contends that more than half of Americans say they are 'pro-life'
","
Protesters from Occupy Providence, who staged a controversial counter-protest to an anti-abortion rally at the State House on Jan. 26, 2012, were the focus of a Feb. 3 appearance by Barth Bracy, executive director of Rhode Island Right to Life, on WPRO radio. 
""They came to disrupt and shout down our rally,"" Bracy said. ""They claim to represent the 99 percent. Apparently they haven't seen the polls that show over half of Americans identify themselves as being pro-life. And they decided that they're about taking a stand for abortion, for public funding for abortion and they're about shouting down the pro-life movement.""

Do opinion polls show that more than half of Americans identify themselves as ""pro-life"" instead of ""pro-choice"" -- the terms abortion opponents and abortion rights supporters use to describe themselves?

When we asked Bracy for the source of his numbers, he sent us to a 2009 Gallup Poll in which 51 percent of respondents identified themselves as ""pro-life"" and 42 percent said they were ""pro-choice."" That was a reversal from 2008, when 50 percent identified themselves as ""pro-choice"" versus 44 percent as ""pro-life.""

It was the first time that abortion opponents have had a majority since Gallup started asking respondents, ""would you consider yourself to be pro-choice or pro-life.""

But since then, the percentage in the ""pro-life"" category has dipped below 50 percent and hasn't recovered.

By May 2011, those identifying themselves as ""pro-life’ were back in the minority, 49-45 percent but with a 4-point margin of error. In the most recent Gallup poll, conducted in July, it was a dead heat: 47-47.

""We did see a shift from the more pro-choice view which prevailed for much of the 1990s and 2000s after Obama took office in 2009, which has softened a bit since then to a more even divide,"" Jeff Jones, Gallup Poll managing editor, said through a spokeswoman.

""The variation we have seen the last two years is due to sampling error, which tends to be a bit more of a factor when we are looking at things with a basically 50-50 split as we see here. I generally would say Americans have been evenly divided on abortion since July 2009.""

Also, the margin of error increased when Gallup began calling cell phones in 2008. It used to be plus or minus 3 points. Now it's plus or minus 4 points.

Thus, the margin hasn't been large enough for either side to claim a majority since that May 2009, survey.

We also checked with PollingReport.com, which logs abortion poll results going back to the 1990s.

The only other survey that has posed a similar question, albeit with slightly different wording, is a Fox News/Opinion Dynamics Poll that has asked people if they are ""more pro-life or more pro-choice."" There, again, more people called themselves ""pro-life"" beginning in 2009.

The highest ""pro-life"" score in that poll was 50 percent, in January 2011 (the most recent), with a margin of error of 2 percentage points. With 42 percent saying that they are ""pro-choice,"" you could say that the Americans with a clear opinion are in the ""pro-life"" camp, but Bracy didn't word his comment that way.

Bracy said he was using the 2009 data because that was what stuck in his head, and joked, ""Is it 2012 already?""

Our ruling

Barth Bracy said the polls ""show over half of Americans identify themselves as being pro-life.""

To us, that means greater than 50 percent of the population now feel that way.

That was true for one Gallup poll that is now nearly three years out of date. Although 51 percent in that survey said they were ""pro-life,"" the level of support has dipped a bit in subsequent surveys.

Gallup frequently polls people on this question, and its polls show that anti-abortion advocates have clearly gained ground since the mid-1990s, when fewer than 40 percent of Americans identified themselves as ""pro-life.""

Given the margin of error, the polls reveal a fairly even divide between the two sides. But the most recent polls show that, despite some surges of support, it is not correct to say that more than half of Americans call themselves ""pro-life.""

We rule Bracy's statement as Mostly False.

Gallup's next survey on the question will be released in May.

"['Oregon', 'Jobs', 'Kevin Cameron']","
Oregon House Republicans tout five-year plan for 50,000 jobs
","
Oregon House Republican leader Kevin Cameron came out swinging in January with a jobs plan that his caucus says could create 50,000 jobs over five years. The plan calls for a mix of tax cuts as well as job growth in forestry, farms and food processing. Cameron insists it’s not a partisan plan and has offered to work with House Democrats who share the chamber with Republicans 30-30.

Democrats said no, thank you, so we’re pretty sure the package won’t go anywhere this month. But a reader asked -- and we agree -- that the numbers need vetting. What’s their documentation for the claim that ""the plan could generate more than 50,000 jobs?""

As our sister organization PolitiFact Florida wrote in July 2010, we can’t weigh in on what may or may not happen in the future. But like PolitiFact Florida, we can check whether the House plan, as put together, actually calls for 50,000 jobs over five years. In other words, has a valid third party come by these numbers in some way?

Cameron is wise to use the word ""could."" And to put it into perspective, 50,000 jobs isn’t too big. Portland Mayor Sam Adams said way back when that he would bring 10,000 jobs over five years in the city. Also, Portland metro area employers added 14,200 jobs over the last year, according to December unemployment figures reported by The Oregonian’s Richard Read.

Nick Smith of the House Republicans provided emails and spreadsheets generated by the building’s nonpartisan Legislative Revenue Office, backed up by reports and data from Business Oregon and the state agencies of Employment, Forestry and Agriculture.

There are seven components to the plan:

(1) Water: Use 450,000 acre feet of water from the Columbia River to boost jobs in farm and food processing. The Agriculture Department estimates 72 acre feet of water could equal one direct job. That would yield 6,250 jobs, plus an additional 4,000 indirect jobs based on a multiplier used by Oregon State University.  

(2) Forests: Increase the amount of new growth timber harvested, adding 175 million board feet of timber to the 275 million board feet harvested in 2010. Legislative Revenue Officer Paul Warner checked with Forestry and calculated 7. 3 direct jobs for each million and 4.7 indirect jobs for each million, totaling 1,278 direct jobs and 823 indirect jobs.

(3) Enterprise: Create more enterprise and e-commerce zones, providing incentives to companies that promise to hire people. The Legislative Revenue Office estimates 4,900 direct jobs and 3,200 indirect jobs.

(4) Construction: Create an income tax credit for capital improvements to private homes and businesses. Legislative Revenue estimates the creation of more than 4,000 direct jobs and 2,600 indirect jobs.

(5) Unemployed: Give businesses a tax break to hire people. Legislative Revenue projects more than 600 direct jobs and 400 indirect jobs.

So far, that adds up to a little more than 17,000 direct jobs and roughly 11,000 indirect jobs. (Indirect jobs refers to the assortment of jobs that could be propped up by the direct job, such as at companies that supply material or at bars that serve thirsty new workers.)

The final two proposals rely on a ""general equilibrium analysis,"" and not impact analysis, which is why there’s no breakout between direct and indirect jobs.

(6) Taxes: Double the income in the two lowest tax brackets, and provide a $250 per child tax credit. Combined, this should save a family of four with an adjusted gross income of $35,000 a year, about $927 a year. Legislative Revenue Office estimates more than 18,500 jobs at the end of five years.

(7) Capital gains: Reduce the tax rate to 2.5 percent for two years, and then increase to 5 percent. This is expected to translate into nearly 3,800 jobs in 2016.

Again, PolitiFact Oregon is not in a position to second-guess economic modeling by Legislative Revenue. But we did ask Paul Warner, the top man there, and Chris Allanach to walk us through some of the analyses. At the end, we asked: Is it fair to say this plan could result in 50,000 jobs?

""Overall, I think it’s objective and under certain conditions I think those are reasonable approximations,"" Warner said. But, he also added, who knows what sorts of global and national factors might have an impact on our jobs picture five years from now?

We turned to House Democrats to get their take. Jared Mason-Gere directed us to Steve Robinson, a consultant and former state analyst. Robinson questions the numbers -- as well as the philosophies behind the tax cuts -- and reminds us of jobs lost by the reduction in money to the public sector, such as at the Department of Human Services. (He points us to a report by ECONorthwest that examines the impact of loss of funding on long-term care workers.)

We totally get that economists could measure impact on jobs in different ways. But the only real question we had left for Warner was whether his analyses regarding taxes and capital gains projected net jobs, in other words, accounting for losses as well as gains. He said yes, after a five-year period.

""So when you reach this new equilibrium state, your private sector is bigger and your public sector is smaller,"" Warner said.

We have a ruling to make. We stated upfront that we don’t have the economic credentials to second-guess these numbers, but we’ve largely cleared them of political manipulation. There are caveats galore, but House Republicans have relied on neutral third-parties to come up with job impact analyses.

The only quibble we have is that indirect jobs are not the same as direct jobs estimated, and the statement should have included the distinction. Still, we end up with nearly 40,000 direct jobs estimated. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/11/kevin-cameron/oregon-house-republicans-tout-five-year-plan-50000/

Barack Obama says preventive care 'saves money'
","
It’s been a staple of health care politics for years -- the claim that preventive care saves money. A little money up front, lots of money saved on the back end. Patients living longer and healthier lives. That makes sense, right? 
But while there’s little doubt that preventive care saves lives, the money is a different story. In general, academic studies do not support the idea that paying for preventive care ultimately saves money. 
We first published that conclusion in 2009, when we rated True a claim by New York Times columnist David Brooks that preventive care does not save the government money. When President Barack Obama claimed it did save money in a September 2009 speech to Congress, we rated it False. 
On Feb. 10, 2012, Obama revived this line of argument. His comments came during a media briefing to announce a partial reversal of a policy that would require church-affiliated organizations such as hospitals to provide a package of free preventive coverage, including contraception. Catholic groups criticized the policy -- which was set in motion by Obama’s health care law in 2010 -- on the grounds that it conflicted with churches’ religious beliefs. 
In announcing a partial shift of policy, Obama said, ""As part of the health care reform law that I signed last year, all insurance plans are required to cover preventive care at no cost. That means free check-ups, free mammograms, immunizations and other basic services. We fought for this because it saves lives and it saves money –- for families, for businesses, for government, for everybody. That’s because it’s a lot cheaper to prevent an illness than to treat one."" 
However, as we wrote in 2009, it’s not true that preventive care generally ""saves money."" 
Brooks' critique relied on estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. ""The evidence suggests that for most preventive services, expanded utilization leads to higher, not lower, medical spending overall,"" CBO director Douglas Elmendorf wrote in an Aug. 7, 2009, letter to Rep. Nathan Deal, the top Republican on a congressional subcommittee involved in the debate. 
Elmendorf explained that while the cost of a simple test might be cheap for each individual, the cumulative cost of many tests adds up: 
""But when analyzing the effects of preventive care on total spending for health care, it is important to recognize that doctors do not know beforehand which patients are going to develop costly illnesses. To avert one case of acute illness, it is usually necessary to provide preventive care to many patients, most of whom would not have suffered that illness anyway. ... Preventive care can have the largest benefits relative to costs when it is targeted at people who are most likely to suffer from a particular medical problem; however, such targeting can be difficult because preventive services are generally provided to patients who have the potential to contract a given disease but have not yet shown symptoms of having it."" 
In fact, a government policy to encourage prevention could end up paying for services that people are already receiving, including breast and colon cancer screenings and vaccines, Elmendorf said. 
Other studies backed up the CBO's analysis, including a Feb. 14, 2008, article in the New England Journal of Medicine that was written in response to campaign promises for more preventive care. 
""Sweeping statements about the cost-saving potential of prevention ... are overreaching,"" according to the paper. ""Studies have concluded that preventing illness can in some cases save money but in other cases can add to health care costs."" They write that ""the vast majority"" of preventive health measures that were ""reviewed in the health economics literature do not"" save money. 
""Some preventive measures save money, while others do not, although they may still be worthwhile because they confer substantial health benefits relative to their cost,"" the authors write. ""In contrast, some preventive measures are expensive given the health benefits they confer. In general, whether a particular preventive measure represents good value or poor value depends on factors such as the population targeted, with measures targeting higher-risk populations typically being the most efficient."" 
Meanwhile, a separate study conducted by researchers from the American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society concluded that, while interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease would prevent many strokes and deaths, ""as they are currently delivered, most of the prevention activities will substantially increase costs."" 
To make sure that the data hadn’t changed dramatically since we last looked at this issue, we contacted Peter J. Neumann, director of the Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health at the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies at Tufts Medical Center. He was one of the three co-authors of the New England Journal of Medicine article. 
He said the patterns his group found in 2008 have not shifted dramatically since then. 
""Sometimes preventive measures save money, sometimes not,"" Neumann said. ""The general message is that it depends."" 
Milton C. Weinstein, one of Neumann's co-authors, agreed. ""In general, the comparative effectiveness literature supports the general proposition that preventive care does not save money,"" said Weinstein, a professor of health policy and management at the Harvard School of Public Health. 
Our ruling 
As a general notion, the idea that ""preventive care … saves money, for families, for businesses, for government, for everybody"" is no more true today than it was in 2009. Yes, preventive measures often save lives and keep patients healthier. Certain preventive measures may save money as well. But the findings of CBO and physicians who have studied the medical literature indicate that Obama’s sweeping generalization that preventive services save money is not accurate. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2012/feb/10/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-preventive-care-saves-money/
"['Abortion', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says he signed legislation leading to closings of 12 abortion clinics
","
At a Personhood USA forum in South Carolina last month, Texas Gov. Rick Perry praised a move by Texas lawmakers to ""de-fund"" Planned Parenthood, which runs family planning and abortion clinics around the country.

According to a Jan. 18, 2012, account by Politico, Perry said: ""I was really proud to be able to sign legislation that we worked with our legislature to defund Planned Parenthood in the state of Texas. There are 12 abortion clinics that aren’t open in the state of Texas today because our members of the Legislature had the courage, the wisdom to do that.""    

Perry’s statement, made the day before he dropped his bid for president, came to our attention from Sarah Wheat, interim co-CEO of the Austin-area Planned Parenthood, who told us via email that none of the clinics Perry referenced provided abortions -- and that 11, not 12, clinics closed.

Wheat told us the Texas clinics to which Perry referred were ""nonprofit health centers … that provided family planning health exams, cancer screenings, treatment for sexually transmitted infections and other basic health care."" Wheat said in another email that the clinics were located in Arlington, Gainesville, Mesquite, Plano, Terrell, Mission, Progreso, Rio Grande City, San Carlos, Alice and Brownsville. She said clinics that provide abortions are ineligible for state funds, while the closed clinics had been receiving state money until September 2011, the beginning of the state’s new fiscal year.

Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), advised by email that there are now 156 state-supported family planning clinics -- compared to 300 through August 2011. Previously, such clinics served 220,000 women a year, she said, while expectations are that the remaining state-supported clinics will serve about 60,000 women a year through August 2013.

In a telephone interview, Williams confirmed  that abortion clinics do not receive state or federal funding. In an email, she said the clinics that closed had each received state funding in 2011.

Separately, she said that had those clinics provided abortions, they would not have been eligible for state money.

Perry repeated his characterization of the shuttered clinics at a Feb. 6, 2012, Republican Party event north of Austin, according to a KVUE-TV report. ""Since I signed that budget,"" Perry said then, ""there have been about a dozen Planned Parenthood 'abortion clinics' that have shut down in this state. There are lives that have been saved.""

We asked Perry spokesman Josh Havens for backup information on the governor’s claim that legislative action caused abortion-providing clinics to close. Havens  said in a telephone interview that he didn’t know which, if any, of the clinics performed abortions. Regardless, Havens said, he would ""make the argument that a Planned Parenthood clinic is an abortion clinic.""

""Even if the specific clinic was (for) family planning, it’s affiliated with its parent organization, which does do abortions,"" Havens said.

Havens agreed in an email that clinics that provide abortion services are ineligible for state funds.

The Planned Parenthood Federation of America Inc. bills itself as ""the nation's leading sexual and reproductive health care provider and advocate"" and runs its sexual health clinics through local affiliates. About 3 percent of the services Planned Parenthood offers are abortion services, the organization says.

In Texas, 14 Planned Parenthood-affiliated clinics provide abortions, according to information on Planned Parenthood’s website. Wheat said its 51 other clinics in the state focus on preventive services, including the provision of contraception and screenings for cervical and breast cancer. The organization also offers some services for men.  

Nationally and in Texas, whether government funding should pay for abortions has long been debated.

Title X of the Public Health Service Act, enacted in 1970, stipulated that federal family planning funds could not be used for abortions, according to Elizabeth Nash, a specialist in state-level sexual health policy at the pro-abortion rights Guttmacher Institute. In 1976, Congress passed the Hyde amendment, significantly reducing federal funding of abortions by banning Medicaid and other programs from spending federal funds on the procedures except in cases of rape or incest, or when the woman’s life is in danger.

In Texas, various laws have addressed the issue of state funding for abortions since the 1990s. But 2003 was a pivotal year. Before then, ""Planned Parenthood and other providers that pay for abortions with non-tax dollars received state money to provide Pap smears, well-woman exams, counseling and mammograms, mostly for low-income patients,"" according to a May 23, 2003, Austin American-Statesman news article.

In 2003, the newly Republican-majority Texas House and Republican-steered Senate agreed to a budget provision barring federal family planning funds from being distributed to health care facilities that performed abortions.  In subsequent legislative sessions, lawmakers renewed that language in each budget. Sometimes, they advanced into law additional proposals intended to keep public funds from reaching abortion providers and clinics affiliated with the providers.

So, what exactly did the 2011 Legislature do that affected the Planned Parenthood clinics?

To our inquiry, Williams of the DSHS pointed out two actions.

First, Williams said, lawmakers reduced the department’s family planning funding by two-thirds. That is, they appropriated $38 million for family planning services for 2012-13, compared to the $111 million budgeted in 2009-10. Williams said the reduction wiped out funds to some of the Planned Parenthood clinics that ultimately shut down.

Besides the funding cut, Williams said, lawmakers advanced two measures, House Bill 1 and Senate Bill 7, restructuring the way funding is allotted for the DSHS-supported family planning centers in the state.

""It stands to reason that (there are fewer clinics now) because of the budget cuts,"" Williams said. ""The budget for family planning was reduced dramatically, and that’s going to change the financial outlook for clinics. There’s less money available.""

Under the restructuring provision, state family planning aid is awarded first to public entities, like state health clinics, that provide family planning services, and last to clinics--like Planned Parenthood--that don’t provide comprehensive health services.

The budget cuts and establishment of the tiered funding system ""changed the landscape for Planned Parenthood and other providers,"" Williams said.

Wheat said that the cut in family planning aid caused the Planned Parenthood clinics to shut down. ""The number one, primary reason for these closures is there’s one-third of the funds that used to be available,"" she said. ""There’s precious few dollars in the state that are left.""

Some Planned Parenthood clinics, including an East Austin clinic now dependent on donations, had previously relied on the state funding to survive, Wheat said. She speculated that when Perry celebrated the 12 closures, he might have been including the East Austin clinic.

So, legislative moves approved by Perry evidently led to at least 11 Planned Parenthood clinic closings.

Presuming those clinics did not provide abortions, since they were eligible for state money, we asked Wheat whether shuttered clinics could still be reasonably associated with abortion clinics -- and if that, as Perry’s spokesman suggested, makes them about the same as abortion clinics.

Wheat said the family planning clinics and abortion service providers were entirely separate, independent nonprofit organizations, per language inserted into each budget since the 2003 legislative session that requires the separation of such institutions in order for family planning clinics to be eligible for state funds.

""We are all Planned Parenthood health centers, but the services that are provided and how we’re legally operated and governed, those are all completely independent,"" Wheat explained.

She said that while Planned Parenthood family planning and abortion clinics fall under the same umbrella organization, and all have to meet certain requirements--professional standards for personnel, for example--the two kinds of clinics are entirely separate, maintaining different bank accounts, different governing boards and filing separate tax returns.

At Planned Parenthood family planning clinics, Wheat said, counselors inform women facing unintended pregnancy of three options: adoption, abortion or prenatal care. Wheat said that if a woman chooses the abortion option, a counselor talks with her about how to proceed and offers a list of resources including abortion providers. However, Wheat said, the family planning clinics do not transfer any client’s medical records to an abortion clinic or otherwise provide medical referrals. Clinics will, however, transfer official medical records for women who opt for prenatal care, she said.

As we closed out this research, we asked Joe Pojman, executive director of the anti-abortion Texas Alliance for Life, to assess Perry’s statement. Pojman said that as far he knows, no Texas abortion clinics shut down as a result of Texas legislative decisions in 2011. Perry, he speculated, was suggesting that Planned Parenthood’s family planning clinics are closely related to the abortion services affiliated with the overarching Planned Parenthood group.  

Havens responded to a follow-up request for clarification of the governor’s statement in an email: ""The governor meant what he said. Planned Parenthood clinics either perform abortions or refer women to affiliated abortion clinics. Neither the governor nor the Texas Legislature make a distinction between whether the abortion is performed on premises or enabled through an affiliate. When a Planned Parenthood clinic closes, it can no longer perform this function.""

Our ruling

Planned Parenthood clinics shut down due to legislative decisions approved by Perry. 
But Perry's key point -- that the clinics provided abortions -- is unsupported. Abortion providers had been ineligible for state funding for years. This reference to abortion is critical to Perry's claim, which we rate Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/feb/10/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-he-signed-legislation-leading-clos/
"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Tommy Thompson']","
GOP Senate candidate Tommy Thompson says that as tax-cutting governor, he ""never raised taxes""
","
When it comes to reciting the tax cutting he did as Wisconsin’s governor, Tommy Thompson can riff as well as any politician.

The Republican U.S. Senate candidate launched into his litany with reporters after giving a speech at the Milwaukee Press Club on Jan. 23, 2012.

John Mercure, host of the afternoon news show on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee, noted that some Republicans prefer a more conservative nominee in 2012 and asked Thompson if he is conservative enough. Thompson said yes.

Mercure then asked: ""What do you say to those critics that say that you're not?""

Cue the riff.

""Ninety-one times I cut taxes; 91 times,"" Thompson replied. ""Three times, income taxes. Eliminated the inheritance taxes, eliminated the gift taxes. Gave the people of this state $2.1 billion in property tax (relief) -- and never raised taxes. If you want a conservative, follow me.""

We’ve rated Mostly True Thompson’s claim that Wisconsin’s overall tax burden went down while he served as governor from 1987 to 2001.

As we said in that item, tax burden is a broad measure:

""Tax burden"" takes those total collections -- including property, income, sales, corporate and other taxes --  and divides them into all personal income earned in the state.  It does not reflect what every individual experienced; it’s a composite measure of the composite statewide tax bite, or burden. The ""burden"" measurement is considered the gold standard for measuring tax impact.

But in saying he never raised any taxes, Thompson raised the bar awfully high, so we decided to take a look.

Darrin Schmitz, Thompson’s campaign spokesman, told us Thompson ""was referring to Wisconsin’s general taxes: income, sales, property and corporate taxes.""

But that’s an attempt to lower the bar.

Thompson did not qualify the statement when he made it. In fact, he listed a variety of taxes.

With a little research we found examples of taxes Thompson raised -- including some of the ones his campaign mentioned as not being raised.

General taxes: The 1995-1997 state budget contained $63 million in tax increases -- including boosts in the general tax increases Thompson cited, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the neutral scorekeeper that tallies tax hikes and tax cuts. The budget projected an increase of $17.5 million in sales tax revenue over the two-year period by eliminating an exemption for certain office equipment. And eliminating an exemption for certain health care providers raised corporate income taxes by a projected $900,000.

(That budget also raised fees by $120 million over two years.)

The 1997-1999 budget contained $125 million in tax increases, the fiscal bureau said. That included an increase of $36 million in sales tax revenue over two years by imposing a ""use tax"" on catalog sales.

Cigarettes: The cigarette tax was 25 cents per pack when Thompson took office. It was raised four times during his tenure and was 59 cents when he left to join President George W. Bush’s administration. (The tax is now $2.52.)

Gasoline: The gas tax rose to 18 cents per gallon shortly after Thompson took office, based on a law adopted before he took office, and rose by more than 8 cents to 26.4 cents before he left. (It’s now 30.9 cents.)

Twelve of the 14 gas-tax increases under Thompson were automatic annual adjustments, which occurred because of the previous law. But Thompson did not take action to stop the automatic increases and two of the increases -- which totaled 3 of the 8 cents -- were raised by budgets adopted during his tenure.      

That’s not an exhaustive list, but it provides enough for the claim at hand.

Our rating

Thompson stated flatly that as governor, he ""never raised taxes."" Thompson has a long list of taxes he cut and, on balance, he can claim to have reduced taxes. But he also raised some specific taxes along the way.

We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2012/feb/10/tommy-thompson/gop-senate-candidate-tommy-thompson-says-tax-cutti/
"['New Jersey', 'Jobs', 'Barbara Buono']","
Barbara Buono claims New Jersey ranked 45th in the nation for job creation in November 2011
","
State Sen. Barbara Buono isn’t buying Gov. Chris Christie’s claim about a ""Jersey Comeback.""

Instead, a dismal record of job creation in New Jersey suggests that ""the American Dream may be slipping out of grasp for many families,"" the Middlesex County Democrat wrote in a Jan. 25 column posted on her website.

""In New Jersey, our unemployment rate still remains above the national average and, as of November, we were ranked 45th in the nation in terms of job creation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,"" Buono continued. ""This is not to say Chris Christie is responsible for all of these woes, but his silence on the issue underscores his indifference (to) the plight of middle class New Jerseyans.""

PolitiFact New Jersey recently ruled, in part, on a similar claim regarding unemployment rates. So we decided to focus on Buono’s claim that ""as of November, we were ranked 45th in the nation in terms of job creation.""

But when we compared New Jersey to the other 49 states and Washington, D.C. for job growth during recent time periods, the Garden State is performing better than what Buono claimed.

Let’s start with the employment picture in New Jersey in November 2011.

That month, there were 3,880,700 total nonfarm jobs in New Jersey, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Those jobs represent private- and public-sector employment.

To back up the senator’s claim, one of her representatives sent us federal labor statistics that demonstrate how the state ranked 43 out of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. for the percentage of jobs created between November 2009 and November 2011.

But that still doesn’t support Buono’s claim about the 45th ranking. 
Buono spokeswoman Christina Zuk told us in an email: ""Bear in mind that the November data may have been adjusted, accounting for the 2% differential. We have no way of calculating what the rank was with the unadjusted data that are no longer available.""

But we told Zuk that the updated figures for November 2011 were available at the time Buono made her statement.

To get a sense of how New Jersey’s growth compares during a more recent time frame, we also looked at jobs created between November 2010 and November 2011. A year-over-year comparison is a common measure of employment changes.

With a 0.7 percent increase in jobs, New Jersey ranked 32 for growth between November 2010 and November 2011.

Since the rankings differ significantly between the one-year and two-year periods, we were wondering which was a better measure of job growth. Three economic experts told us either time frame is appropriate.

""There's no question that a year over year comparison is very common, and credible time frame to evaluate employment trends,"" Doug Hall, director of the Economic Analysis and Research Network at the Washington, DC-based Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, said in an email.

Hall added: ""In this case, however, I think November 2009 gives us something valuable, since it's more or less the time period since the national ‘recovery’ began.""

Edward Montgomery, an economist and dean of the Georgetown Public Policy Institute, agreed that both time frames are acceptable. Montgomery has held various federal government positions under President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton.

""It is not ‘wrong’ to look at job growth over intervals of 1 month, 6, months, a year, or even some other interval (e.g. 2 years),"" Montgomery said in an email. ""That said, it is more ‘usual’ to look at an interval that has some easy meaning or relevance like in the past year (nov 2010 to nov 2011) or over the last decade or since the President took office etc.""

Since Buono framed her column as a critique of the governor’s ‘comeback’ theme, we also analyzed job growth since February 2010, Christie’s first full month in office. In terms of the percentage increase in jobs, New Jersey ranked 39 out of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. for growth between February 2010 and November 2011.

So, when you study more recent time periods, New Jersey is performing better than the 45th ranking cited by Buono.

Our ruling

In a column, Buono claimed that ""as of November, we were ranked 45th in the nation in terms of job creation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.""

Her representative sent us data showing that New Jersey ranked 43 for the percentage of jobs created between November 2009 and November 2011. But that still doesn’t support what the senator claimed.

When you analyze growth between November 2010 and November 2011, New Jersey is doing better, ranking 32 for a 0.7 percent increase in jobs.

Since the 43rd ranking for the two-year period comes close to the ranking in Buono’s column, we rate the statement Mostly False.

"['Rhode Island', 'City Budget', 'Economy', 'Taxes', 'Lincoln Chafee']","
Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee says that the commercial property tax in Providence is second-highest in the nation behind only Detroit
","In his State of the State speech, Governor Lincoln Chafee declared this ""the year of the cities and towns"" and promised to work to relieve the burden on property taxpayers.

""People who have worked hard and played by the rules their entire lives are worried because they may be one property tax payment away from losing their home or business,"" he said in the Jan. 31 speech. ""We must reverse this trend.""

In the days afterward, the governor reiterated this commitment. During a Feb. 3 appearance on Channel 12’s ""Newsmakers,"" Chafee pointed to the negative effects of an increasing reliance on property taxes in Rhode Island’s economically distressed communities -- Central Falls, West Warwick, Pawtucket and, of course, Providence.

""And no wonder there’s empty stores in Providence,"" he said. ""The commercial property tax is second highest in the country behind Detroit.""

The issue of property taxes has come to the fore in Providence with the ongoing fight between the financially struggling city and its tax-exempt nonprofits. Providence leans heavily on tax payments from businesses and residents to raise revenue. But is the city’s commercial property tax really the nation’s second highest?

Chafee’s spokeswoman referred us to a report released last month by a financial panel advising Providence. The report, ""A System Out of Balance,"" from the Commission on Revenue, Sustainability and Efficiency, recommended a series of changes to raise money for the city, including higher sales tax receipts, more state aid and larger contributions from Providence’s nine colleges and hospitals.

To put the issue in context, the report included a comparison of commercial property tax burdens in Providence and other major cities across the country, taken from a joint study in 2010 by the nonpartisan Minnesota Taxpayers Association and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a Cambridge, Mass.-based nonprofit think-tank.

The ""50-State Property Tax Comparison Study,"" which has been done periodically since 1995, examines property taxes across the country in three ways: by comparing taxes in the largest city in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the second-largest cities in Illinois and New York  because Chicago and New York City have such idiosyncratic tax systems (so 53 cities in all); by comparing taxes in the 50 largest cities by population in the country; and by comparing the taxes in a single rural community in each of the 50 states.

Providence was considered among the first group of 53 cities. It did indeed rank second for the highest commercial property taxes, behind only Detroit. Des Moines was third, Philadelphia fourth and New York City fifth.

According to the study, for a commercial property valued at $1 million and with $200,000 in fixtures, the net property taxes in Providence would be $47,695 a year. The effective tax rate, which factors in statutory exemptions and assessment practices, would be 3.975 percent.

The same property in Detroit would pay $48,141 for a rate of 4.012 percent. In contrast, that property in Cheyenne, Wyo., which ranked 53rd in the study, would pay $7,824 under a 0.652-percent rate.

Providence is not included in the second group of the 50 largest cities in the country. (With 178,042 people, Rhode Island’s capital ranks 131st, according to the 2010 census.) If it were, it would still be second for commercial property taxes, again behind Detroit.

If Providence were included in the third group of rural communities, it would rank second for commercial property taxes, behind Iola, Kan.

Providence has moved up the list as its financial crisis has deepened in recent years: in 2007, the city ranked 16th for commercial property taxes. In 2009, it ranked sixth. It moved to second in 2010.

So Providence does have the second-highest commercial property taxes in the most recent 50-state study. But although that study is certainly comprehensive, it is not exhaustive. It did not look at every city in the country. We looked for more research.

Our first call was to the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group based in Washington, D.C., that does state-by-state comparisons of tax issues. Joseph Henchman, director of state projects, referred us to a draft report that compared the tax burdens that identical hypothetical corporations would have in about 100 U.S. cities. (The study looked at two cities in most states; it looked at only one city in Rhode Island and other small states.)

In that study, which has yet to be released, Providence would have the third-highest commercial property taxes for a corporate headquarters, according to Henchman, behind Des Moines and Columbia, S.C.

""It’s looking like no matter how you do it, Rhode Island is not coming up real good,"" said Henchman.

Our ruling

Chafee said that Providence has the second-highest commercial property tax in the nation, citing a City of  Providence report that cites the Minnesota report. Neither report makes that definitive claim.

But the Minnesota report does say Providence is second highest in its comparison of 53 cities. And if Providence were included in comparisons of the nation’s largest cities, it would also rank second.

A Tax Foundation study ranks Providence third for commercial property taxes by one measurement, but different ways of comparing tax burdens could account for the difference.

It’s possible there are other cities with higher commercial property taxes, but we couldn’t find any.

Although Chafee went a step too far in saying definitively that Providence’s commercial property tax is the second-highest in the country, there is ample evidence to support his statement and little that contradicts it.

We rate the claim Mostly True.

"['Taxes', 'Texas', 'Ted Cruz']","
Ted Cruz says David Dewhurst has a record of promoting a Texas income tax
","
U.S. Senate hopeful Ted Cruz gave reporters a humor-tinged handout about front-running David Dewhurst before the Republican candidates’ Austin debate in January.

The handout listed reasons Dewhurst, the state’s lieutenant governor, might duck the debate -- which Dewhurst did not. On the list: One of Dewhurst’s horses threw a shoe; Dewhurst, who is wealthy, was in Tokyo; his private jet broke down.

We fixed on reason No. 2: ""Come on, would you want to show up and have to defend your record promoting an income tax?""

Texas is one of nine states lacking a state income tax. The last statewide elected official to publicly suggest one, the late Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, left office in early 1999, nearly eight years after he briefly maintained that a state personal income tax made economic sense. The prospect proved so unpopular, Bullock later ushered in a constitutional amendment requiring voter approval before a personal income tax can become law.

So, we wondered about Cruz’s claim.

At the debate, reporter Brad Watson of Dallas’ WFAA-TV asked Cruz what proof he had of Dewhurst promoting an income tax. Cruz replied that in 2006, Dewhurst told The Associated Press, ""I think I’d rather see a tax that is based on income.""

Also, Cruz said, the Wall Street Journal editorialized in 2005 that Dewhurst was ""pushing what he called a wage tax."" Cruz, quoting the editorial, continued: ""A wage tax is of course a fancy disguise for a personal income tax.""

It’s way-back time.

To assess Cruz’s claim, we looked into the mid-decade efforts by state leaders to overhaul the state’s tax system partly to drive down local school property taxes. Those debates culminated in a 2006 revision of the business franchise tax and other tax changes.

First, let’s plumb the articles offered by Cruz as proof of Dewhurst’s actions.

A March 30, 2006, AP news article, headlined ""Businesses studying proposed tax structure,"" indeed quotes Dewhurst as saying: ""I think I'd rather see a tax that's based on income — you earn money, you pay something, you don't earn money, you don't pay anything.""

We can see why a critic would single out that comment, though the full AP story indicates that Dewhurst was speaking to the particulars of revamping the business franchise tax rather than advancing his desire to create a personal or business income tax.

The story initially points out that lawmakers had previously stumbled over how to restructure the business tax, which most corporations did not owe. ""They worried that proposals would not apply equally to different business structures,"" the article says. ""And business-friendly Republicans have been hesitant to levy a new tax that could be harmful to job creation and economic growth.""

According to the story, the consensus proposed fix -- which was a plan devised by a panel headed by John Sharp, a former Texas state comptroller -- would tax businesses on a percentage of their gross receipts, meaning the money a company brought in before expenses, with each company choosing between deductions for cost of goods sold or employee benefits like salary and health care. The story says sole proprietors and general partnerships would be exempt, along with companies that have annual gross receipts of $300,000 or less.

For more than 80 years, the story says, the state’s main business tax had been based on a company’s net assets, though lawmakers changed it in 1991 to make it more like a corporate income tax. Texas companies subsequently had the choice of paying either 0.25 percent of the value of their net assets or 4.5 percent of their net corporate income, whichever was greater, according to a 2003 report on Texas taxes by the nonpartisan House Research Organization.

In 2006, lawmakers revised the franchise tax along the lines of the Sharp proposal.

The March 2006 AP story, published before lawmakers acted, says two business groups seemed receptive to the proposed overhaul. But it quotes the president of the Texas Auto Dealers Association expressing concern that a gross receipts-based tax would be assessed against businesses even if they had not earned a profit.

Next, the story quotes Dewhurst as saying that the Texas Senate, over which he presides, is sensitive to that concern. It then quotes him saying he’d rather see a tax based on income so if you earn money, you  pay something and if you don’t, you do not.

Dewhurst appears to have reconsidered his comment the next day -- or, perhaps, recognized how it might be taken as a politically risky, Bullock-like call for a state income tax. According to an April 1, 2006, Houston Chronicle news article, Dewhurst ""retreated from his statement a day earlier that he favored basing a business tax on a company's income, rather than its gross receipts."" The story quotes Dewhurst saying: ""I have always opposed a business or personal income tax.""

Cruz told us in a telephone interview that he reads Dewhurst’s initial comment as noted by the AP as indicating he was for a business income tax.

He urged us to put stock as well in the May 10, 2005, Journal editorial, headlined ""Deep in the Heart of Texas,"" which takes Dewhurst to task for state budget and tax proposals then in circulation within the Republican-led Legislature. The editorial states that Texas’ status as a state without an income tax is ""in serious peril,"" continuing: ""Both the state Senate and House have endorsed what Mr. Dewhurst -- whose post of lieutenant governor is nearly as powerful as governor in the state -- is calling a ‘wage tax.’ A wage tax is of course a fancy disguise for a personal income tax, and imposing one is a sure way to put a state on the path to slower growth.""

Cruz told us: ""The wage tax that (Dewhurst) promoted is effectively the same thing as an income tax,"" though Dewhurst, he said, ""wasn’t foolish enough to use the label ‘income tax.’""

The Journal editorial airs concerns about possible tax increases to cover cuts in school property taxes, among them a new wage or payroll tax, which the editorial calls a toll on employers for hiring workers.

Finally, Cruz suggested significance in Dewhurst’s subsequent letter to the Journal regarding the editorial; the response talks up the Senate’s tax plan, but is silent on the Journal’s likening of a wage/payroll tax to a business income tax.

With Cruz’s backup laid out, let’s turn to other signs of an income tax plan being offered or endorsed by Dewhurst in 2005-06.

A Nexis search for such news articles shows the House and Senate each explored numerous tax ideas.

We spotted no stories on Dewhurst or anyone in the Republican leadership promoting a personal or business income tax. But two conservative observers said payroll tax elements of proposed House and Senate franchise tax overhauls amounted to income taxes.

Some nitty gritty: The House in March 2005 approved a revenue package that offered companies a choice of paying the existing franchise tax or a 1.15 percent payroll tax on salaries up to $90,000 a year.

In May 2005, the Senate answered with a plan allowing companies to choose the lower of two taxes, as long as they generate more money than a minimum tax of 0.25 percent of gross receipts. As described in a May 12, 2005, Austin American-Statesman news article, the first option for businesses was to pay 2.5 percent of the sum of their net taxable income plus payroll, though they could deduct from the tax base either half of their payrolls or $30,000 per employee plus the cost of some health benefits. The second option in the Senate plan would have required  companies to pay a 1.75 percent payroll tax, capped at $1,500 per employee.

In an opinion column published in the American-Statesman March 16, 2005, Matthew J. Griffing of the Young Conservatives of Texas said House Speaker Tom Craddick, a Republican, was to blame for the House advancing its payroll tax, which Griffing called a backdoor income tax. ""Of course, the Republican leadership does not have the courage to call this an income tax or assess it directly against the people. Instead, it calls it a ‘payroll tax’ and assesses it against employers rather than employees,"" Griffing wrote.

And a May 21, 2005, AP news article quotes a former U.S. House Majority Leader, Dick Armey of Texas, as saying the payroll elements of the business tax proposals were the same as income taxes.

The AP article, foreshadowing that year’s legislative failure to agree on how to fund cuts in school property taxes, points out that elements of measures approved by the House or Senate ""include some form of a tax on wages."" Critics, including Armey, the story says, ""call the proposals a disguised income tax, which is illegal in Texas."" It quotes Armey urging Gov. Rick Perry to stop the ""wage tax"" in its tracks but quotes Dewhurst as saying the proposed payroll tax was not an income tax.

Was the lieutenant governor right about that?

Close observers of the 2005-06 tax debate told us the payroll tax elements might have been objectionable, but they weren’t generally taken as income tax schemes.

Bill Hammond, president of the Texas Association of Business, said in a telephone interview the taxes would have been paid by employers on top of wages -- instead of being taken out of individual pay checks like an income tax. ""I don’t think anyone in the Capitol thought of that as being an income tax. If they had, it wouldn’t have gotten past the (committee) hearing stage,"" Hammond said.

Laura Hoke, spokeswoman for the National Federation of Independent Business in Texas, said the group opposed the payroll tax proposals as job killers, but did not view them as income tax plans.

Dale Craymer, president of the business-membership Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, and tax analyst Dick Lavine of the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, each said the payroll tax elements were not income taxes.

Lavine, who has helped the center urge lawmakers to establish a state personal income tax since the mid-1990s, said he would not call the payroll tax elements income taxes partly because they failed to tap all forms of income -- such as capital gains.

Broadly, Craymer said, ""there never was an income tax proposal"" from, or supported by, Dewhurst. Lavine agreed.

Finally, we consulted two out-of-state tax experts who each said he wouldn’t characterize payroll taxes, sometimes imposed by individual communities, as income taxes because they’re levied as a percentage of an employer’s payroll rather than being taken out of each employee’s wages.

Seen another way, payroll taxes are not based on a firm’s income, Richard Pomp, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law, said in a telephone interview. Instead, Pomp said, they’re tied to the costs of doing business.

After we described the payroll tax approaches considered in Texas, Michael McIntyre, a professor at the Wayne State University School of Law, saw significance in their not being based on all employees' wages, while he said income taxes are typically levied on all workers. ""I’d probably say it’s some other tax,"" McIntyre said.

Our ruling

Contrary to Cruz’s claim, Dewhurst has not promoted a personal or business income tax. It's even a stretch to say he edged in that direction in March 2006 with the comment he quickly forsook. 
All told, the idea that Dewhurst has a record of promoting an income tax is so far from accurate, it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2012/feb/10/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-david-dewhurst-has-record-promoting-/

Romney revises claim about the unemployed
","
Super Tuesday is only one month away, which means the GOP presidential hopefuls are descending on Georgia to convince voters they deserve Barack Obama’s job.

And speaking of jobs, they’re hammering Obama on unemployment.

When Republican front-runner Mitt Romney stumped at an Atlanta custom countertop showroom Wednesday afternoon, he said that ""25 or 24 million"" people are ""out of work or stopped looking for work.""

A PolitiFact Georgia team member stood among the crowd of 300, Truth-O-Meter in hand. It lit up and told us that Romney was doing a new take on an old talking point.

Last month, during the Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Romney said that ""we have 25 million Americans out of work"" during the Republican presidential debate. Our colleagues at PolitiFact National ruled his statement Half True.

Does Romney’s revised statement earn him higher marks on the Truth-O-Meter?

First, let’s look at his statement from January.

Officially, there were about 13.1 million unemployed Americans in December 2011, which put the unemployment rate at 8.5 percent. This is according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s source of employment statistics. Romney’s count was some 12 million higher.

Here’s why:  

When PolitiFact National analyzed Romney’s statement, they pointed out that certain critics have long argued that the BLS definition of unemployment is too limiting. It doesn’t count people who have stopped looking for work or are working part time, even though they’d prefer a full-time job.

To address this concern, BLS offers an alternative measure (known to economists as ""U-6"") that includes these other groups.

By this metric, an additional 2.6 million people in the U.S. were ""marginally attached"" to the labor force in December 2011, meaning they’d be ready to work if a job became available. Another 8.1 million were working part time but would prefer a full-time job.

Together, these three categories added up to 23.8 million people in December 2011, for a total ""U-6"" rate of 15.2 percent -- well above the official unemployment rate. Romney’s data was a little high, but in the ballpark.

Romney earned a Half True. His use of the term ""out of work"" was a stretch when about one-third of the ""25 million Americans out of work"" are actually working part time, PolitiFact National ruled in January.

Now on to Romney’s statement in Atlanta.

Romney described those ""25 or 24 million"" people as being ""out of work"" or having ""stopped looking for work.""

The newest jobs data shows Romney’s calculation for the total number of unemployed, looking for work or are working part time, even though they’d prefer a full-time job, remains more or less accurate.

In January, some 12.8 million people were unemployed and 2.8 million people were marginally attached to the labor force, according to BLS figures. An additional 8.2 million were working part time even though they wanted a full-time position. Once again, that totals 23.8 million.

But Romney’s latest description of these workers was a little off the mark.

The BLS describes ""marginally attached workers"" as people not in the labor force who want to work and are available to do it, and who have looked for a job in the past 12 months, but had not done so in the past four weeks.

These people want work, but have recently given up because they have family obligations, think they can’t get a job, or other reasons.

The BLS calls people who are working part time even though they’d prefer a full-time job as working ""part time for economic reasons."" This is defined as those who worked one to 34 hours a week because they can’t find full-time work or business has slowed down.

The BLS does not ask whether they stopped looking for work.

Of the 24 or 25 million workers mentioned by Romney, only 15.6 million clearly match his description as being ""out of work"" or having ""stopped looking for work.""

The remaining one-third may or may not be angling for more hours or a full-time slot at their current employer. They could have stopped looking for full-time work altogether. We don’t know.

Romney’s statement is partially accurate, but he gets important details wrong. He therefore earns a Half True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/10/mitt-romney/romney-revises-claim-about-unemployed/

Patrick Murphy voted for House Benghazi committee, US Rep. Alan Grayson says
","U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson wants voters to think he’s the only true Democrat in the race for Marco Rubio’s soon-to-be-open Senate seat. After all, he reasoned, his primary opponent helped Republicans create the Benghazi committee. ""Two years ago last Sunday, the Benghazi committee came into being,"" the Orlando businessman and former lawyer said in a fundraising email on May 11, 2016. ""There are only three Democrats in the House today who voted for it. One of them is my primary opponent, Patrick Murphy."" Murphy, a Jupiter Democrat, was a Republican before switching parties two years before being elected to Congress in 2012. His moderate views have been challenged by progressives and especially Grayson, who has endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders in the presidential race. Could it be true Murphy was among a handful of Democrats who voted to investigate leading Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton? In a word, yes, although Murphy said it was because he wanted to clear Clinton’s name. Back to Benghazi On Sept. 11, 2012, just before President Barack Obama’s re-election, Islamic extremists attacked a U.S. diplomatic mission and a CIA compound in Benghazi, Libya. U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed. Various conspiracy theories and cover-ups became partisan talking points as the White House was questioned about al-Qaida involvement and what officials did and did not know about the attack. Then-Secretary of State Clinton and the State Department faced scrutiny that has continued during her presidential campaign. By May 2014, seven congressional probes and a State Department review board had examined the issue. A conservative watchdog group obtained State Department emails about the attack  that had been withheld from one of these House committees, sparking calls for a new investigation. The Republican-led House voted to form the House Select Committee on Benghazi, comprised of seven Republicans and five Democrats, to again question the Obama administration’s handling of the incident. The May 8 vote largely went along party lines, 233 to 186. We say ""largely"" because seven Democrats crossed the aisle and voted to create the committee. Murphy was one of them. (He did not serve on the committee.) Grayson chose his words carefully when he cited ""three Democrats in the House today."" Four of those seven Democrats who voted for the panel are no longer members of Congress. Only Murphy, Minnesota’s Collin Peterson and Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema are still in office. Murphy released a statement following the vote, saying he hoped Congress would not use the panel to grandstand on the issue. We couldn’t find the press release on Murphy’s House website, but the Tampa Bay Times published the statement in part: ""While the congressman respects the work his colleagues have done already investigating this matter, when it comes to American lives lost overseas in service to our nation, we must make sure that all questions have been answered. He sincerely hopes that this committee is not used as a way to politicize this tragedy and the deaths of four Americans."" This isn’t the first time Grayson has attacked Murphy over the vote. On Oct. 2, 2015, he called the committee ""a partisan clown show"" that had been ""done with Patrick Murphy's permission."" By Oct. 21, Murphy told MSNBC that officials were abusing the process and the panel’s usefulness was over. ""Based on what we’ve heard just in the last several weeks from Leader (Kevin) McCarthy, to the whistleblower to Congressman (Richard) Hanna coming out, admitting pretty clearly that this is a political witch hunt, I think it’s past time that we disband this committee,"" Murphy said. MSNBC’s Chuck Todd asked Murphy if he regretted the vote, but Murphy stayed firm: ""I stand by it, because I think it’s more than proven that there is nothing to hide there."" When we contacted Murphy’s campaign, his spokesman echoed a past statement that ""Republicans turned this tragedy into a political circus"" and reiterated Murphy wanted the committee shut down. There’s little evidence that Clinton or other liberals are holding Murphy’s vote against him. Murphy is favored by Democratic officials in the U.S. Senate race, and Clinton reportedly told donors at a 2015 fundraiser that she is ""so proud of him."" Republicans on the committee have said they expected to release a final report in the summer before the 2016 election. Our ruling Grayson said Murphy is one of ""only three Democrats in the House today who voted"" to create the Benghazi committee. Murphy did vote with six other Democrats to create the committee in May 2014 (four of those seven are no longer in the House). Grayson is trying to paint Murphy as a conservative in liberal’s clothing. Murphy says his vote was to help clear Clinton’s name. That’s a bit of context that Grayson should have included, so we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/may/16/alan-grayson/patrick-murphy-voted-house-benghazi-committee-gray/
"['Economy', 'LGBTQ', 'Sexuality', 'States', 'North Carolina', 'Chris Sgro']","
Democratic Representative Chris Sgro says North Carolina has already lost $500 million due to HB2
","In calling on state leaders to repeal House Bill 2, a Democratic state representative – Chris Sgro, who also leads a group suing over the new law – cited both his moral opposition and the financial backlash North Carolina has suffered. ""We've already lost $500 million in economic impact and now we are violating federal civil rights law and risking Title IX funding,"" Sgro said in a press release after the Obama administration announced its belief that HB2 violates various federal laws. ""This is a travesty and embarrassment for North Carolina."" The General Assembly passed HB2 in March. The wide-ranging state law includes a requirement that people in government facilities use bathrooms that match the gender on their birth certificate. A number of businesses, performing artists, conventions and more have announced boycotts of the Tar Heel State in response. That led Sgro (who was appointed to the General Assembly after HB2 passed and is the only openly gay legislator in North Carolina) to claim the law has cost North Carolina half a billion dollars. North Carolina’s gross domestic product in 2015 was about $500 billion. So a $500 million loss wouldn’t be that much in the grand scheme of things. But it would still be important for the individuals and businesses who had counted on having that money. ‘Really tangible losses’ Sgro said he was quoting a study from the Center for American Progress (CAP). The D.C.-based liberal think tank published a study April 13 that detailed the actual and potential economic losses through 2018, due to boycotts over HB2. North Carolina had already lost $86.3 million by mid-April, according to the report. So why did Sgro say $500 million a short time later? It’s worth noting that the CAP study isn’t the only one – Time Warner Cable News put the losses at $77 million. But since Sgro said he was citing the CAP study, we’ll look at that one. Reading further, the CAP report goes on to say that North Carolina could lose an additional $481.2 million in the future, for a total of $567.5 million. That’s the number Sgro said he was referring to. The key here is the distinction the report makes between money that’s at risk versus money already lost. In an interview, though, Sgro defended combining the two. And his group, Equality NC, later repeated the figure in a second press release. ""I really think the higher number is the more accurate way to couch the economics of this,"" he said. ""There are some really tangible losses already."" There are indeed tangible losses. But even throwing in an estimated, yet-to-be-verified loss suffered by the High Point Furniture Market – which happened between when the study was released and when Sgro made his remarks – the ""already lost"" tally still isn’t even half of the $500 million Sgro claimed. We double-checked each of the individual losses listed in the study that made up the $86.3 million figure and were able to confirm all of them except for $3 million attributed to Lionsgate pulling a comedy film crew from Charlotte. CAP used an outdated report to come to that conclusion; we found a more recent report that put it about $1 million lower. The CAP study was released before Asheville announced more than $1 million in losses after a conference cancellation. Since that essentially cancels out the difference, we’ll continue to use the $86.3 million cited by CAP. Sgro said there are also losses that can’t be counted, like businesses that have quietly decided not to consider coming to North Carolina. Google’s venture capital branch has also pledged not to invest in North Carolina, and several studios have said they won’t film in the Tar Heel State – all losses that are difficult to quantify. ""It’s significant, and it's compounding every single day we don't repeal the bill,"" Sgro said. Still, though, those are future potential losses – not money that has already been lost or pulled. And we weren’t convinced by the argument that it’s accurate to lump the two together. That’s because a closer look shows that many of the companies listed in the CAP study haven’t actually promised to pull their investments out of North Carolina if HB2 remains state law. ESPN ""said it’s re-evaluating its plans,"" to bring the X Games to Charlotte, according to the Charlotte Observer. That’s a potential loss estimated at $50 million, but it might not happen even if HB2 remains the law. The same goes for another $127.5 million from Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, Red Ventures, the NCAA and various conferences in Raleigh. In each of those cases, the groups said only that they would reconsider plans in North Carolina. None said for certain that HB2 would derail those plans. Two big hits The NBA has been more certain about moving its 2017 All Star Game from Charlotte if HB2 remains intact, but that’s still only a potential loss – and one that the CAP study may have over-exaggerated. The study lists its economic impact as $195 million. That’s the same number estimated for the 2015 All Star game in New York City. But not only has the accuracy of that 2015 estimate been called into question, it’s also worth asking if New York is really the best comparison. When doing its own estimates, the City of Charlotte used the 2014 All Star game in New Orleans, a city much closer in size, tourism draw and prices than New York. That game likely brought New Orleans a much lower impact of $106 million. And what about CAP’s estimated $143.4 million from High Point Furniture Market losses? The law was condemned by many businesses and trade associations connected to the twice-yearly market, which has generated more than $5 billion in recent years and has been called North Carolina’s largest economic event. The $143.4 million number would represent a small decline in its economic impact. But we have no way of knowing whether it’s an accurate estimate. Tom Conley, the market’s CEO, told us the market is still trying to get an accurate count of this April’s attendance and any possible losses. But for the sake of argument, we’ll give CAP and Sgro the benefit of the doubt here. Using CAP’s formula and attendance numbers from previous spring shows, we calculated that of the $143.4 million that could be lost at some point, $55.4 million could’ve already been lost at last month’s market. A researcher with CAP told us he thinks the group’s number was even a bit conservative, pointing to a story from CBS News that estimated the losses from this spring alone could hit $115 million. Neither number, though, gets Sgro’s ""already lost"" claim even close to $500 million. If the CAP estimates on the furniture market turn out to be accurate, then combined with the $86.3 million in already lost and documented funds, we come to a total of $141.7 million already lost from North Carolina’s economy. That’s less than a third of what Sgro said. Using the CBS estimate for the furniture market, the total rises to $201.3 million. Finally, it’s important to note that that some of the already-lost money might even return to North Carolina in the future. PayPal and Deutsche Bank stopped plans to hire hundreds of workers, but they also both said they might change their minds if HB2 is repealed. Our ruling North Carolina’s economy has already lost, by various counts, either $77 million, $86.3 million, $141.7 million or $201.3 million. None of those are even close to the $500 million Sgro claimed has already been lost. It’s true that the state might eventually lose up to $567.5 million in economic impact, according to one study. Sgro was using that number, but the vast majority of that money hasn’t already been lost, like he claimed it had been. What’s more, many of the businesses threatening boycotts haven’t even said for certain that they will cancel if HB2 remains law, meaning the $567.5 million figure could drop substantially. And if HB2 is repealed, it’s also possible that some of the ""already lost"" money might return in the form of new jobs and investments. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/48fe6bc0-b383-4020-adf3-d8135ab9a49a",/factchecks/2016/may/16/chris-sgro/democratic-representative-says-north-carolina-has-/

Terry McAuliffe’s decision to restore voting rights to about 206,000 felons who have served their time and said Republicans opposing the action want to suppress turnout in this fall’s presidential election. Locke participated in a May 8 panel discussion of McAuliffe’s decree conducted by NewsOne.com, an outlet dedicated to presenting news to black Americans. ""There’s this feeling that somehow, since the governor did this, that somehow this state is once again going to vote for a Democrat for president of the United States,"" she said. ""So that is the fear, that somehow, these 206,000 individuals are going to vote for a Democrat."" ""We do not have voters in this country flocking to the polls,"" she added. ""The United States has a low voter turnout rate. You would think that you would want individuals voting in this country."" There’s no shortage of Republicans who are accusing McAuliffe of issuing the blanket restoration of rights to help presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton - his good friend and fellow Democrat - carry Virginia this fall. What caught our attention is Locke’s claim that the U.S. has a low voter turnout. We wondered if she’s right. Locke pointed us to a May 2015 study by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. It examined voter turnout in the member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 democratic nations - mostly with industrialized economies - seeking to improve trade. Voting-age population Pew looked at OECD members’ most recent national elections. It computed the votes cast as a percentage of each country’s estimated voting-age population.   In the U.S., Pew estimated that 53.6 percent of citizens old enough to vote participated in the 2012 presidential election. That ranked 31st among OECD nations. The only trailers were: •Japan, 52 percent in 2014; •Chile, 45.7 percent in 2013; and •Switzerland, 40 percent in 2011. By contrast, the five countries with the highest age-eligible turnout were: •Belgium, 87.2 percent in 2014; •Turkey, 86.4 percent in 2011; •Sweden, 82.6 percent in 2014; •Denmark, 81.8 percent in 2011; and •Australia, 80.5 percent in 2013. It’s important to note that three of the top five - Belgium, Turkey and Australia - have mandatory voting laws. There are 14 nations in the world that enforce such statutes, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. Registered voter turnout If Pew’s 53.6 percent voting-age participation estimate for the U.S. in 2012 sounds low to you, there’s a good reason. Turnout often is expressed as the percentage of registered voters who cast ballots and, under this measure, the U.S. does fairly well. In 2012, when President Barack Obama won a second-term challenge from Republican Mitt Romney, 84.3 of registered voters went to the polls - ranking seventh in that measurement among OECD countries. But Pew says national turnout comparisons based on registered voters ""may not be very meaningful."" That’s because ""in most countries, the government takes the lead in getting people’s names on the rolls - whether by registering them automatically (as in, for example Sweden or Germany) or by aggressively seeking out and registering eligible voters (as in the U.K. and Australia). As a result, turnout looks pretty similar regardless of whether you’re looking at voting-age population or registered voters. ""In the U.S., by contrast, registration is mainly an individual responsibility,"" Pew says. ""And registered voters represent a much smaller share of potential voters in the U.S. than just about any other OECD country: Only 65 percent of the U.S. voting age population (and 71 percent of the voting-age citizenry) is registered, according to the Census Bureau, compared with 96 percent in Sweden and 93 percent in the U.K."" For these reasons, Pew said that political scientists ""typically"" measure turnout by looking at the percentage of age-eligible people who went to the polls. We found one other data source that compares election turnouts based on countries’ voting-age population. The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance compiles that information for 109 nations and territories. The U.S., with its 53.6 percent turnout in 2012, ranked 73rd. Top on its list is Uzbekistan, a landlocked former member of the Soviet Union, where 98.4 percent of age-eligible people voted in its 2015 presidential election. At the bottom is Haiti, an impoverished Caribbean nation, had an 18.9 percent turnout. Our ruling   Locke said ""The United States has a low voter turnout rate."" She based her statement on a Pew study that shows the U.S. ranks 31st among 34 OECD nations in the percentage of age-eligible people who cast ballots in recent national elections. Wider data, compiled by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, ranks the U.S. 73rd among 109 nations and territories.

Pat Toomey says Katie McGinty agrees with Hillary Clinton on everything -- does she?
","Correction appended During a recent broadcast of Dom Giordano’s Philadelphia talk radio show on 1210AM, as Buzzfeed reported, U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., called it outrageous that Democratic nominee Katie McGinty tied him to GOP Presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. The two have wasted no time battling it out ever since McGinty won the Democratic primary April 26 to take on Toomey in the general election. As a comeback, Toomey compared McGinty’s campaign stances to those of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. ""She actually agrees with Hillary Clinton and the most liberal wing of the Democrats on everything,"" said Toomey. We reached out to Toomey’s campaign for more background. ""The only times McGinty has publicly deviated from the Obama and Clinton agenda are when she's gone even further to the left, like embracing Bernie Sanders-style single-payer healthcare and defending sanctuary cities,"" Communications Director Ted Kwong said to PolitiFact PA in an email statement. Many observers would dispute aligning Clinton with party’s most liberal faction. Nevertheless, we looked through issues backed by two candidates, and we found that Toomey’s claim doesn’t hold up entirely. Sure, there are plenty of things McGinty and Clinton agree on. Both cite a need for good-paying jobs and strengthening America’s clean energy economy — just two examples out of many. But, we haven’t found evidence to prove that Clinton and McGinty agree on each issue. Actually, we were able to find a couple on which their views don’t align. One of Clinton’s big campaign issues is that ""climate change is an urgent threat,"" and she says we need to ""invest in clean energy innovations."" McGinty has the same stance. However, when you look at fracking, McGinty’s views set her apart from much of the party. Clinton’s position has evolved some, but at present she believes fracking should only be permitted if the local residents approve. McGinty on the other hand thinks, with proper taxation and regulation, fracking should get the green light. The two democratic nominees also have had very different histories with free trade. Clinton’s position on NAFTA is complicated, to say the least. When Bill Clinton first signed the agreement into law in 1993, Hillary Clinton publicly supported it, but that support has waned over time. She most recently publicly backed NAFTA in her autobiography written in 2003 and in a teleconference that took place in 2004. Since that time, Clinton has not made public statements defending the free trade agreement. In fact, in 2008 Clinton called herself a ""critic of NAFTA from the very beginning."" In reality, Clinton’s public position on NAFTA has certainly shifted over the past few years. McGinty’s stance on NAFTA has also evolved, but her present position is much less convoluted. In a democratic debate live from the University Park campus of Penn State last month, McGinty called NAFTA ""something that hasn’t worked in 30 years."" So, it’s not the case to say that the two candidates agree on everything. It would be more accurate to say they share the vast majority of issues that they’ve endorse publicly. This is pretty common in Democratic races. In the lead-up to the primary, polling expert G. Terry Madonna told TribLive that McGinty differed little in stances from her fellow Democratic candidates, John Fetterman and Joe Sestak. ""This campaign is about personalities and style,"" Madonna said. ""On 100 issues in the Senate, these candidates would probably vote the same way on 98 of them. I don't think the issues are as defining as who these candidates are."" Richardson Dilworth, director of the Center for Public Policy at Drexel University, argued that campaign stances aren’t always directly representative of a candidate’s personal beliefs, but of the campaign’s stakeholders, of the constituencies the politician is aiming to attract. Looking beyond established platforms, two candidates can differ on more than their common planks would suggest. ""There’s a distinction between [Clinton’s] personal opinions and what she promises as a candidate. Those two things don’t have to agree. There’s no reason to expect that she’s going to have the same personal opinions as she would have about positions she publicly takes because the positions she has to take as a candidate are going to be negotiations among many stakeholders,"" Dilworth said. Dilworth thinks McGinty’s and Clinton’s strong similarities are no coincidence, though. ""Pennsylvania is, to a certain extent, representative of the country, more so than many other states,"" said Dilworth. ""In that respect, McGinty will be making a lot of the same pitches as Hillary Clinton because she’s going for the same kinds of voters."" Our ruling Senator Pat Toomey stated that Katie McGinty agrees with Hillary Clinton on everything. After closer inspection, it has become clear that although McGinty and Clinton share similar positions on many issues, there are a couple of significant instances where their opinions differ. Furthermore, many of their shared opinions can be attributed to the similarities in their intended audiences. McGinty and Clinton have expressed similar public opinions on many issues, but it wouldn’t be wholly accurate to say that they agree with each other on everything. We rate the claim Half True.   An earlier version of this story characterized Katie McGinty's views on fracking as in line with Bernie Sanders. This is inaccurate. As the article describes, she is pro-fracking, provided taxes and fair regulation are in place. Sanders is decidedly anti-fracking.",/factchecks/2016/may/16/pat-toomey/pat-toomey-says-katie-mcginty-agrees-hillary-clint/
"['Immigration', 'Virginia', 'Ken Cuccinelli']","
Ken Cuccinelli says half of illegal immigrants have overstayed visas
","Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli says Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s plans for a border wall with Mexico has its limits in stemming the flow of unauthorized immigrants into the U.S. ""Half the people who come into this country illegally don’t cross the border illegally,"" Cuccinelli, also a Republican, said recently during an interview with conservative radio host Laura Ingraham. ""They come on legal visas and then overstay, and then we can’t find them."" We examined Cuccinelli’s claim. Similar versions of this statement have been uttered by other Trump opponents, including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who recently suspended his campaign for the GOP presidential nomination. Cuccinelli was a key strategist for Cruz. Cuccinelli sent us several studies to back his point. He noted that in a 2004 report, the Government Accountability Office said three separate estimates culled from various surveys by the Department of Homeland Security found visa overstayers made up 27 percent, 31 percent and 57 percent of undocumented immigrants in three small surveys of immigrants. Two of those surveys asked immigrants caught in sting operations how they entered the country. The third survey asked green card holders whether they overstayed their visas or crossed into the U.S. illegally. ""The percentages above do not represent the illegal population but, as indicated above, do provide some evidence that in all likelihood, a substantial proportion of illegal immigrants are overstays,"" the GAO said. Cuccinelli also pointed to a widely cited report by the Pew Research Center in 2006. It estimated ""nearly half of all the unauthorized migrants now living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport or a border crossing point where they were subject to inspection by immigration officials."" While the source data gave an estimate that said somewhere between 33 percent and 50 percent of undocumented immigrants were visa overstayers, the report went middle-of-the-road and called it 45 percent. Pew relied on a 1997 study by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The INS report concluded that in 1996, 41 percent of illegal immigrants had entered the U.S. legally. The problem is that neither the INS nor its successor, the Department of Homeland Security, have provided updated statistics on the percentage of undocumented immigrants who overstayed visas since that aging study. Cuccinelli also cited a 2014 study by Robert Warren, a former INS demographer who worked on that federal agency’s 1997 report. Building on figures from the earlier INS report, Warren estimated that in 2012, visa overstayers comprised 58 percent of the people who became undocumented immigrants that year. Why do analysts estimate the number of visa overstays rather than relying on hard government figures? The reason is that while the U.S. does a good job getting information about foreign visitors when they enter the country, it does not collect reliable data from them when they depart, according to a report issued in January by The Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank that examines immigration trends. Michelle Mittelstadt, the institute’s director of communications, said that in the absence of firm data from the government, analysts typically say that between one-third to one-half of unauthorized immigrants are people who have overstayed the time they were legally allowed to be in the U.S. ""When we use those estimates, we are clear to note that this is based on some pretty historical work,"" Mittelstadt told us. ""The reality is that there are no better estimates out there right now."" Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that while estimates of undocumented immigrants have been stable since 2007, the number of people entering illegally across the southwestern U.S. border has ""collapsed."" That means that the proportion of those overstaying their visas likely is on the rise, he said. ""The patterns of illegal immigration have changed since this question was last investigated,"" Nowrasteh wrote in an email. ""Cuccinelli is likely closer to the truth today than he would have been in previous years."" Our ruling Cuccinelli said half of illegal immigrants ""come on legal visas and then overstay."" This widely cited statistic stems from an estimate based on research going back to the 1990s. The federal government hasn’t provided updated statistics on overstayed visas, and subsequent research has focused on adapting the old data to new trends. Estimates in those reports have ranged from 27 percent to 58 percent of illegal immigrants overstaying their visas. So Cuccinelli is using what research shows to be a plausible figure. But he would be more accurate to refer to it as an estimate rather than a fact. We rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/may/16/ken-cuccinelli/ken-cuccinelli-says-half-illegal-immigrants-have-o/

NC House speaker says 80 percent think bathrooms should be separated by biological gender
","As the battle over who should be able to use what bathroom rages on in North Carolina and nationwide, opponents of transgender-friendly rules say public opinion is on their side. Tim Moore, the speaker of the N.C. House of Representatives, said it’s an overwhelming consensus. ""The one thing where we’ve seen nearly unanimous – well, nothing’s unanimous – but 80 percent support out there is the concept that men should not be in women’s restrooms, changing rooms, bathrooms, et cetera – that that shouldn’t happen,"" Moore said in a May 5 discussion with reporters. We looked into polling on bathroom policy and found a wide range of results. Most don’t reach 80 percent, but clearly substantial numbers of people in North Carolina have told pollsters they oppose letting transgender people choose what bathroom to use. Polls have found safety concerns are also on some people’s minds. No one can say that there will never be any privacy or safety issues – of course there could be. But in a previous fact check, we looked for instances of sexual predators using the cover of transgender-friendly bathroom laws to dress up as the other sex and prey on people in bathrooms, the scenario many have said they’re concerned about. We found it Mostly True that such a scenario has never happened. We didn’t give it a True because there have been a few unproven allegations in the U.S. and one conviction in Canada. The Obama administration also hasn’t put stock in those concerns, and has said banning transgender people from the bathroom of the gender with which they identify is a civil rights violation. It was in that context, along with the administration’s threat to withhold federal funding from North Carolina, that Moore made his ""nearly unanimous,"" ""80 percent"" claim. Uncertainty abounds We did find one poll from the conservative Raleigh-based Civitas Institute that was close to backing up Moore’s claim. We’re not sure if it’s the poll he was citing or if he was citing a poll at all – Moore didn’t respond to our questions – but we’ll proceed anyway. The poll asked: ""Do you agree or disagree with a Virginia federal court ruling ordering girls and boys in public middle schools to share locker room, bathroom and shower facilities? The poll did find that 80 percent of people said they disagreed with the court ruling. However, we have several issues with the question. The question is not only leading and inflammatory but also fundamentally misconstrues what the court ruled. No boys and girls were ordered to shower, change or use the bathroom together. Instead, a federal appeals court ruled that a judge in Virginia had to reconsider a transgender boy’s request to use the boys’ facilities at school. The court also said the Obama administration acted legally in defining sex-based discrimination to include discrimination against transgender people. That’s the part that may have given rise to the poll question’s wording, since the student is likely to win now. Yet the Obama administration has repeatedly said that although schools should recognize transgender students’ rights, schools should also recognize other students’ right to privacy and that no student should be forced to openly share a changing area. In school districts around the country that have already recognized transgender students’ gender identities, officials have typically put private stalls in locker rooms and/or offered unisex one-person bathrooms. Given the issues with that question, let’s look at another. Another earlier poll from Civitas asked people a more accurate and nuanced question about transgender people in bathrooms, describing the arguments on both sides. This poll came before the state overturned Charlotte’s LGBT ordinance. ""The Charlotte City Council passed a new bathroom ordinance for transgender people that allows biological men and biological women, who identify as the opposite sex, to use the bathroom or locker room of their choosing,"" the question stated, asking people to pick sides. Nearly 70 percent said they opposed the idea. Not 80 percent, but close. But what about polls from groups with less political bias? According to a joint poll from SurveyUSA in partnership with Time Warner Cable News, 51 percent of North Carolinians think transgender people should not be able to choose which bathroom to use. That’s not ""nearly unanimous"" like Moore said; it’s barely a majority. Another joint poll from SurveyUSA and a different TV station, WRAL, found 56 percent in agreement that transgender people shouldn’t be able to choose which bathroom to use – again, a majority, but not close to 80 percent. Our ruling A prominent conservative group, Civitas, did find 70 and 80 percent in two polls, although we had some serious doubts about the question that found the 80 percent support. Two polls from the less partisan SurveyUSA in partnership with local TV stations have found 56 percent and 51 percent of North Carolinians support the idea. That’s still a majority, but it’s certainly not the ""nearly unanimous,"" ""80 percent support"" that Moore claimed.

"['Nevada', 'Energy', 'Solar Energy Fairness']","
Nevada solar subsidy claims need more evidence
","A group backed by Nevada’s energy monopoly is airing television ads that aim to cast a shadow over the well-publicized complaints of the rooftop solar industry. Solar Energy Fairness (which is backed by NV Energy, the state’s electric service monopoly) is airing an ad throughout Nevada with a narrator warning that ""big rooftop solar"" is trying to trick consumers into supporting a ""government-mandated subsidy with no limits."" ""Big rooftop solar's plan forces Nevada families who don’t have solar panels to pay higher power bills to subsidize rooftop solar,"" it warns. The rooftop solar battle has seen angry protests and everyone from presidential candidates to actor Mark Ruffalo speaking out on the issue, so we thought the subsidy question was one that needed to be answered. A primer on net metering The gist of the subsidies question centers around Nevada’s net-metering program. Like most states, Nevada has a net-metering law that allows ratepayers who install solar panels and microturbines to sell excess energy they generate for use by their neighbor. Lawmakers created the program in 1997 to encourage shifting more of the state’s energy production to renewable sources. Generally, the idea is that utility companies will buy excess energy at the retail rate, so the ""seller"" is charged only for their net energy use. The process is an incentive for customers to make the investment in solar energy to lower their power bills. Critics of net metering, however, say solar customers are getting an unfair advantage because they’re not paying for the network that harnesses and distributes electricity. And in 2015, Nevada’s Public Utilities Commission agreed. The regulatory group effectively lowered the amount of credits solar customers can receive after determining that net metering participants were receiving an unreasonable subsidy. That prompted a revolt from solar companies, who left the state in mass, laying off workers and fighting to reverse the commission’s ruling through the ballot. The evidence Solar Energy Fairness (the group behind the ad) claimed that net-metering participants in Southern Nevada received $623 in annual subsidies under the former plan. In Northern Nevada, the annual subsidy was $471, the group claimed. In explaining the regulatory change, the PUC said that net-metering participants see a cost shift, or subsidy, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars over an extended period of time. That cost-shift contradicted a 2015 Legislative directive to reduce any ""unreasonable shifting of costs"" from net-metering participants to other energy customers. But net-metering customers make up a tiny percentage of all energy customers in the state, so the commission’s highest estimate of a per-month subsidy for other power customers would be between $1-3 a month, depending on inclusion of a rebate program. While the ad itself refers specifically to the net-metering program, it’s worth noting Nevada has previously subsidized rooftop solar installation to the tune of $225 million through a rebate program approved by the state Legislature. Arriving at a figure Determining the exact subsidy figure is complicated. Utility commissioners outlined 11 possible variables in their ruling to determine the value of the net metering. It included a broad range of possible costs and benefits, ranging from the avoided energy that would be needed to replace locally produced solar electricity, total grid capacity and the possible social and environmental boons. The sticking point for many is that the commission only used two of the 11 factors (reduced line losses and capacity) when determining the value of excess energy produced through net metering — the other nine were not used because they were difficult to quantify. Rooftop solar advocates, like Chandler Sherman of advocacy group Bring Back Solar, say omission of the other nine factors nullifies the subsidy argument entirely. ""These are real tangible benefits,"" she said. ""This is real dollars and cents the utility is saving."" The problem is that arriving at a more balanced measurement of the full costs and benefits of net metering is really difficult. Devin Hartman, a former energy analyst with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, wrote a policy brief criticizing the ""utter lack of convincing evidence of cost-shifting"" in the commission's report. But he acknowledged that actually putting down a dollar figure for some of the benefits can be speculative as well. Ashley Brown, a former Ohio utility commissioner and current director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group, said expanded rooftop solar penetration undermines the ability of utility commissions to set rates, and said the presumed benefits generally are outweighed by costs. ""Solar is intermittent,"" he said. ""You have to ignore it for purposes of planning capacity."" Hartman told PolitiFact that the existence of a net-metering subsidy depends on variable market factors, but writing off all potential benefits likely leads to a flawed outcome. ""Methodologically, you can come up with a better estimate than saying, ‘we just don’t have anything,’ "" he said. ""There was room for improvement, even though the task itself was very difficult."" Another difficulty is the lack of standardized metrics used to measure potential net metering subsidies. A 2013 Rocky Mountain Institute study found many states overlap in their measurements of cost and benefits, but contain a ""significant range of estimated value across studies."" An independent analysis Both sides point to an independent analysis of Nevada’s net-metering program, done by Energy+Environmental Economics in July 2014 at the request of the commission. Rooftop solar advocates often refer to a section proclaiming a $36 million benefit for all consumers through net metering, but several factors in the study — like the price of solar per megawatt hour — have substantially changed since the report was issued in 2014. Still, it’s worth noting that study did not detect a major cost shift either way. Solar Energy Fairness spokeswoman Nicole Willis-Grimes said the Legislature has requested an update to the ""E3"" study, and Bring Back Solar’s Sherman says that SolarCity and non-profit group Natural Resources Defense Council are preparing their own study on the alleged cost-shift. Best estimates So what does all of this mean for the average energy customer who isn’t in the net-metering program? The subsidy figure used by Solar Energy Fairness likely represents the worst-case scenario, as it’s difficult to foretell the actual cost and benefits of the net metering program because so many factors have changed since the last independent report was filed in 2014. Though the assumed monthly subsidy cost is relatively small, Solar Energy Fairness spokeswoman Nicole Willis-Grimes notes that the number of net-metering applications skyrocketed in 2015 — going from around 6,000 participants between 1997 and June 2016 to more than 24,000 applications over the following six months. Our ruling A pro-NV Energy backed group is running ads claiming that ""Nevada families who don’t have solar panels to pay higher power bills to subsidize rooftop solar."" The net-metering subsidy question is complex and likely takes more than a 30-second television ad to explain in full. The root of the subsidy claim comes from a Public Utilities Commission decision that has been criticized for focusing too narrowly on the costs of the program. Rooftop solar systems have traditionally seen subsidies on both the state and federal level, but without hard evidence of a cost-shift occurring under the previous net metering rates, it’s a difficult argument to hold up. The reality is more complicated than Solar Energy Fairness puts on. We rate this claim as Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a31514aa-c154-4824-9ec9-400e0a178cdf",/factchecks/2016/may/13/solar-energy-fairness/solar-subsidy-claims-need-more-evidence/

Fighting for Ohio PAC ad takes Ted Strickland’s 'mixed and spotty' quote out of context
","A campaign ad by the political action committee supporting Republican Sen. Rob Portman features a video clip of his opponent, former Ohio governor Ted Strickland, a Democrat, saying, ""My record is mixed and spotty, and I can be criticized for that,"" before the ad launches into attacks on his economic record.   The narrator says that Strickland is speaking ""on his record,"" then slams Strickland for 350,000 jobs lost and $8 million in taxes raised. PolitiFact Ohio has checked those two figures before and rated the claims Half True and Mostly True, respectively. Now we’d like to know where Fighting for Ohio got that ""mixed and spotty"" clip. Did the former Ohio governor really fall on his sword over the economic upshot of his tenure? No, he didn’t. The ad takes Strickland’s words out of context. Text under the video cites a Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial board’s February interview of Democratic primary Senate candidates, which is posted in its entirety on YouTube. The context tells the tale. At the 26:13 mark of the interview, primary hopeful P.G. Sittenfeld asked Strickland, ""Why should Democratic voters not judge you by your record on guns?"" He criticized Strickland for reversing his anti-gun control stance, a change of heart Strickland’s aides have attributed to the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., that resulted in the deaths of 20 children and six adults. Strickland countered that he welcomed voters to judge him by his record, then changed the subject to the diversity of his cabinet appointees during his term as Ohio’s governor from 2007 to 2011. But the topic snapped back to guns (at the 28-minute mark) when one of the off-camera Plain Dealer interviewers asked Strickland to clarify his stance. ""Has my position changed over time? It has,"" Strickland answered. ""Can people criticize me for that? Absolutely. You’re not going to find me out there saying my records with guns is not a legitimate -- you know, it’s one of many issues that people will look at and make a decision about me and this race, and so on and so forth."" From there, Strickland tried to explain his gun rights position, calling President Bill Clinton’s 1994 crime bill, which he voted against in Congress, ""one of the worst pieces of legislation that’s been passed in decades."" He said he dropped his NRA membership ""five or six years ago,"" and defended a recent radio interview in which he boasted about his A+ rating from the NRA in 2010.   Strickland’s monologue concluded at the 31:40 minute mark, when he said, ""My record is mixed and spotty, and I can be criticized for that."" The next 12 minutes of discussion is fixed on the candidates’ stances on gun control. Not employment, not taxes. Steiner Public Relations in Columbus, Ohio, is fielding questions for Fighting for Ohio. Their spokesperson, Jen Detwiler, said, ""We’ll let the content of the ad stand on its own."" Our ruling An attack ad juxtaposes employment figures and tax dollars with a video clip of Strickland saying, ""My record is mixed and spotty, and I can be criticized for that."" Strickland’s stance on gun control may have wavered, but the context in which he made the ""mixed and spotty"" statement did not. Strickland was talking about guns, not jobs or taxes. The Fighting for Ohio PAC’s ""Spotty"" ad distorts the context of his statement.

","Not to get all inside-baseball, but news releases issued by Gov. Scott Walker are usually pretty plain, like the white chalk lines that meet at home plate. So, it was a surprise to see Walker’s May 10, 2016 release about the faculty at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, which arrived like a pitch thrown at a batter’s chin. Walker called a no-confidence vote being taken that day by the Milwaukee faculty a mere ""fuss."" The professors were expressing ""their collective groan"" about budgeting and ""job-for-life tenure."" The school ""should not be about protecting the interests of the faculty, but about delivering value and excellence to Wisconsin."" For a Walker news release, pretty vitriolic stuff. But in another way, the release was more typical, as it was filled with bullets of factual claims -- including this one, about the ratio of students to faculty at UW-Milwaukee: ""At 2.8 students per faculty,"" the release declared, ""average student enrollment per instructor is currently tied for second-lowest in its history since 1994."" Fewer than three students for every faculty member? That would be a swing and a miss. No-confidence votes UW-Milwaukee’s total enrollment of 27,000 (22,000 undergraduates) makes it the second-largest school, behind UW-Madison (43,000 and 31,000), in the University of Wisconsin System. The system is overseen by members of the Board of Regents, nearly all of whom are appointed by the governor. Since Walker took office in 2011, the system campuses have received budget cuts and professors have seen tenure protections partially weakened. Those are key reasons for a series of no-confidence votes directed at the UW System, beginning with one approved by UW-Madison faculty eight days before the UW-Milwaukee vote. Walker’s pre-emptive statement was issued less than two hours before nearly 300 Milwaukee faculty members unanimously passed their no-confidence vote. That represented roughly 40 percent of the full-time faculty. Walker’s figure To back the 2.8 ratio claim, Walker’s office cited a UW System chart on ""average individual instruction."" The latest figure, for fall 2013, shows a ratio of 2.8 for UW-Milwaukee. But that is not a ratio of the total students per faculty member, as Walker says in the news release. It is a much narrower measure. As the chart itself explains, that is the ratio is for ""individualized instruction, such as independent study or thesis research."" Indeed, you would expect a ratio of 2.8 students per faculty member for such one-on-one-style instruction. But Milwaukee’s overall ratio is much different. The actual ratio Robin Van Harpen, UW-Milwaukee’s vice chancellor for finance and administrative affairs, gave us figures for fall 2015. Using full-time-equivalents, the school had 22,491 total students and 779 faculty (faculty being full, associate and assistant professors). That’s a student-to-faculty ratio of 29 to 1. Moreover, in 1994, the year Walker referenced in his news release, the ratio was actually lower: 21 to 1. And it has steadily trended upward since then. In other words, the ratio of students to faculty at UW-Milwaukee is growing, not shrinking. Two final points: Lecturers and adjunct instructors, who also teach, are not considered faculty. But if you include them in the count, the current ratio is 19 to 1 -- still far above what Walker claimed. The day after the Milwaukee vote, Walker’s office essentially corrected itself in a statement on a no-confidence vote at UW-Green Bay. The statement cited the same 2.8 statistic as it applied to Green Bay -- but added a line to make clear that the ratio referred only to individualized instruction. Our rating Charging that the ratio of students to faculty at UW-Milwaukee is shrinking, Walker said the school has ""2.8 students per faculty"" member, ""tied for second-lowest in its history since 1994."" But Walker cited the wrong statistic. In fact, UW-Milwaukee has 29 students for every professor, associate professor and assistant professor -- and that ratio has been growing, not shrinking, since 1994. For a statement that is false and ridiculous, our rating is Pants on Fire.

Steve Adler correctly says Austin No. 1 in Texas in startups, venture capital investment, patents
","Austin’s typically soft-spoken mayor recently popped a big-as-Texas boast. ""There’s a reason Austin is number one in Texas in startups and venture capital and patents,"" Steve Adler said. Adler, speaking outside City Hall, went on: ""There’s a reason that tech and transportation companies come to Austin to roll out their new initiatives. And that’s because Austin is where good ideas become real. Claiming that Austin is anti-innovation has no basis in fact."" Hear hear! Still, we wondered about the rankings Adler declared while revealing his plans to vote against a ballot proposition, later rejected by voters, affecting background checks of drivers for ride-hailing services. Startups Adler's office didn't immediately offer his backup. Meantime, our online search for information on startups led us to a June 2015 report from the Kansas City-based Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation stating that in the ""last year,"" the Austin metropolitan area ranked No. 1 nationally for the area’s pace launching startups, which the foundation defined as ""firms less than one-year old employing at least one person besides the owner."" Asked what ""last year"" means in the report, foundation researcher E.J. Reedy advised by phone the conclusion tied to data from 2012 and 2014. According to the foundation, which says it focuses on improving lives through education and entrepreneurship, the nation’s top 10 metropolitan areas for ""startup activity"" among the 40 most-populous metropolitan areas were: Austin; Miami, Fla.; San Jose, Calif.; Los Angeles; Denver; San Francisco; New York; Houston; San Diego; and San Antonio."" Per Adler’s Texas point, the Austin area had 180.8 startups per 100,000 residents, the foundation says, outpacing the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area (142.5 startups per 100,000 residents), Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown (136.9 startups per 100,000 residents) and the San Antonio-New Braunfels area (111.9 startups per 100,000 residents). By email, foundation spokeswoman Lacey Graverson told us the presented concentrations drew on the U.S. Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics to tally startups matched with population data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Reedy agreed by phone that among the big Texas cities, the Austin area had the greatest concentration of startups. But generally, Reedy indicated, counts of startups can vary, partly because there’s no single accepted definition of startups, which inherently come and go at a rapid pace. The government has official measures, Reedy added, but each one captures an aspect -- for instance new employer businesses or newly self-employed individuals. Also, Reedy said, observers differ over what merits counting. Some stress large firms that employ many, he said, others urge a fix on technology firms and others say that any count should recognize small businesses (including one-person endeavors) that grow by an employee or two a year. A foundation chart presenting Austin’s ""startup density"" since the late 1970s indicates the area has had peppier times--including in 2008 (201.7 startups per 100,000 residents), 2006 (214.9), 1999 (217.9) and, the chart’s high point, 1981 (499.5), which was up a huge measure from 1980 (31.4):              SOURCE: Web page, ""Startup Activity, Austin Area, 2015,"" Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, June 4, 2015 (viewed May 5, 2016) Venture capital Next, we turned to exploring Austin’s ranking for venture capital, which describes money invested in a business or project at considerable risk. A January 2016 Austin American-Statesman news story, citing a survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association,  said Austin entities in 2015 were ""by far"" the state’s largest recipients of venture capital, with $740 million; Dallas firms placed second, fielding $214.4 million, ahead of Houston outfits, at $160 million. The Austin-connected investments added up to the largest annual dollar figure for Austin since 2001, the newspaper said, when 127 companies received $1.14 billion. By email, mayoral spokesman Jason Stanford pointed out another account of the survey results; a Silicon Hills News story said the 99 Austin deals in 2015, mostly to develop software, were down from 114 in 2014. Also, the story said, Austin’s number one deal for the latest year was Civitas Learning, attracting $60 million in venture capital, followed by Aeglea Biotherapeautics with $44 million, Mirna Therapeutics with $41.8 million and SpareFoot with $30 million, the story said. Nationally in 2015, the Statesman story said, venture capital investments rose to $58.8 billion, up 22 percent from the year before. Silicon Valley, as usual, took in the most money, with the San Jose area receiving $27.3 billion in 1,333 deals, the story said. Patents Stanford said Adler made his claim about Austin leading Texas in patents based on a May 2010 Forbes.com article by Andy Greenberg stating that Austin and neighboring Round Rock had ""produced an impressive average 1.7 patents for every thousand residents over the last 12 months,"" the second-most per-capita of any metro area in the country, he wrote. Greenberg elaborated: ""Austin’s culture of innovation may be boosted by well-known tech credentials like the South by Southwest (SXSW) Web startup and music festival held annually in March, as well as the nearby headquarters of hardware industry giants Dell and Freescale Semiconductor. But they also have two secret weapons in the innovation race: the University of Texas’s Cockrell School of Engineering, and IBM’s Austin research lab. ""IBM produces more patents than any other company in the world, and for the last seven years Austin has produced more of those patents than any other IBM office. In total the lab produced 880 patents in 2009. That’s just 30 less than all of Cisco, and 300 more than Sun Microsystems, Boeing, AT&T or Toyota."" We were unable to confirm or duplicate Greenberg’s Austin conclusion. To get our own sense of how Texas cities stand in patents originated, we reached out to the Dallas-based regional office of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. By email, spokesman Ryan Elliott pointed out patent counts posted by the office indicating that in 2012-13 and from 2000 through 2013, the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area generated more patents than the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area. However, the regions’ raw counts were close, according to the agency, while the Austin area was responsible for more patents than any other Texas area from 2009, 2010 and 2011 through 2013, by our reckoning. Snapshot: The Austin area was responsible for 12,387 patents from 2009 through 2013, according to the office, with the Dallas area accounting for 11,546 patents -- which we took to mean that the less populous Austin area ran well ahead of the Dallas area in patents per 1,000 residents. Our search for relevant analyses led to a 2013 report by the Brookings Institution finding that from 1980 to 2012, most U.S. patents--63 percent--had been developed by people living in just 20 metro areas home to 34 percent of the U.S. population. ""Reflecting the advantages of large metropolitan economies,"" the report said, ""92 percent of U.S. patents are concentrated in just 100 metro areas, with 59 percent of the population. For patents applied for from 2007 to 2011, the metro areas with the highest number per capita are San Jose; Burlington, VT; Rochester, MN; Corvallis, OR; and Boulder, CO."" The authors wrote: ""From 1980 to 2011, a few large metros notably changed their share of U.S patents. At the top, San Jose moved up from ninth to first, and San Francisco moved from seventh to fourth, moving ahead of Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Boston. Seattle and San Diego moved up 15 and nine places, respectively, to become seventh and eighth. Meanwhile, Austin and Raleigh moved up 41 and 55 places, respectively, to become 11th and 20th. Cleveland fell 10 slots from 13th to 23rd, while Philadelphia fell from fourth to 13th."" Not only did Austin surge in total patents, it lately achieved a high ranking in per-capita patents. From 2007 through 2011, a chart in the report indicates, the Austin metro area had 1,503 patents per million residents, tops in Texas and placing the area fourth nationally among high-patent areas behind San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, California (5,066 patents per million residents); Poughkeepsie-Newburgh-Middletown, New York (1,829); and San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont (1,638). In Texas, the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown metro area had 379 patents per million residents and the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area had 310 per million, according to Brookings. Next, we heard back from Mark Muro of Brookings who shared a chart that he said was based on a different data source -- global PCT patents, meaning the international patent system rather than the U.S. PTO. By that metric, the chart suggests that from 2008 through 2012, the Houston metropolitan area generated more cutting-edge ""technology"" patents per 1,000 residents (1,598) than the Austin area (1,294). An excerpt:                        SOURCE: Chart ranking 100 U.S. Core Based Statistical Areas in tech patents invented per 1,000 population, 2008-2012 (received by email from Mark Muro, senior fellow and policy director, Metropolitan Policy Program, Brookings, May 5, 2016) Regardless of those results, Muro and a Brookings colleague, Nick Marchio, suggested we hew to the U.S. patent office counts as the best general way of assessing the mayor’s claim. Marchio even volunteered to adjust the patent office’s raw counts for the population of each metropolitan area. Result: In 2013, the latest year of tabulated patents, the Austin area ranked No. 11 nationally with 1.55 patents per 1,000 residents, far outpacing the No. 2 Texas metro, Dallas, at 51st with 0.44 patents per 1,000 residents. Also, from 2009 through 2013, the Austin area ranked 10th nationally with 6.95 patents per 1,000 residents, far ahead of the No. 2 Texas metro, in this case the Houston area, which landed 52nd nationally with 1.81 patents per 1,000 residents. Our ruling Adler said: ""Austin is number one in Texas in startups, venture capital and patents."" Houston has been running ahead in international technology patents, it looks to us, but Austin lately leads the state in overall patents, startups and venture capital. We rate the claim True.

"['Debt', 'Deficit', 'Wisconsin', 'Sean Duffy']","
Did Sean Duffy flip-flop on what should be done about Puerto Rico's debt crisis?
","House Speaker Paul Ryan is not the only Wisconsin Republican being targeted by The Center for Individual Freedom for supporting a measure aimed at helping Puerto Rico resolve its debt crisis. The center, a conservative non-profit based outside of Washington, D.C. that does not disclose its donors, claimed in a TV ad that Ryan’s support for a measure from U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wausau, amounted to backing a ""bailout"" for Puerto Rico. We rated that claim Half True on the Truth-O-Meter. In a separate radio ad, the center argues Duffy flip-flopped on what Congress should do to help resolve Puerto Rico’s debt crisis. We’re going to put that one to our Flip-O-Meter. Our requisite reminder: The Flip-O-Meter simply measures whether a political figure has been consistent, not whether any change makes for good (or bad) politics or policy. So, has Duffy changed his views on how to respond to Puerto Rico’s debt crisis? The ad The one-minute ad, launched April 22, 2016, paints a bleak picture for Puerto Rico -- which is $72 billion in debt and now defaulting on debt payments -- then shifts its attention to a critique of Duffy.    ""In February, Congressman Sean Duffy warned against Super Chapter 9 for Puerto Rico. Duffy said granting Puerto Rico Super Chapter 9 would pave the way for overspending states like California, New York, and Illinois to also declare bankruptcy."" The ad maintains Duffy has ""flip flopped,"" and is now ""leading the fight"" for Super Chapter 9 bankruptcy for Puerto Rico. Unlike the 50 states, Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory,  isn’t covered under Chapter 9 of the U.S. bankruptcy system, which grants various public bodies -- including municipalities and public utilities -- the right to declare bankruptcy. Duffy highlighted that point in a Feb. 17, 2016 keynote speech to the American Action Forum, which is part of the conservative advocacy organization  American Action Network. ""I think bankruptcy should be the priority over a taxpayer bailout,"" Duffy said in the speech. ""I put out a state-based Chapter 9 bankruptcy proposal -- just like you have in Wisconsin, just like you have in Texas -- so municipalities and public corporations in Puerto Rico can file for bankruptcy just like they can in Wisconsin. ""But the general obligation bonds of Puerto Rico proper can’t access bankruptcy."" That is a key point in this discussion. ""Super Chapter 9"" has become a loaded phrase in Washington, but may carry different meanings for different people. For instance, in the radio ad itself, the definition seems to be applied to any measure that allows the territory of Puerto Rico itself to declare bankruptcy -- not just municipalities or smaller government units on the island. Indeed, it goes so far as to declare Duffy’s bill is ""Super Chapter 9."" Duffy, for his part, defined Super Chapter 9 as ""allowing bankruptcy for the general obligation bonds."" He said allowing this in Puerto Rico would amount to a ""tee-up"" for bankruptcy of general obligation bonds in high spending states like Illinois and California. But that provision is not in Duffy’s bill. For the purposes of this item, we can actually set aside the differing definitions, since we are looking at whether Duffy has changed his stance. We will also focus in on the period since February 2016, since that is the benchmark used in the ad. The bill Let’s look at the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act. This is the measure -- supported by Duffy -- that is in question in the radio ad. The bill, introduced April 12, 2016,  would create an oversight board as an entity within the Puerto Rican government to aid in reforming the territory’s financial crisis. The board could facilitate restructuring of debt with creditors and, as a last resort, seek court supervised restructuring. In our item examining whether the measure amounted to a bailout, we noted the measure would allow Puerto Rico to pay less to some creditors than the creditors are owed.

In terms of the impact on American investors, many bond funds have already sold their Puerto Rican debt, and the debt is now mostly owned by hedge funds, according to the Associated Press. But Oppenheimer Funds and Franklin Templeton still own part of the debts.

So, a restructuring almost certainly would mean that Americans who, through brokers or choices they made in their retirement accounts, put some of their savings into Puerto Rican bonds almost certainly will get a lower return on their money, the experts told us. Thus, the measure has some bankruptcy-like qualities. But that, too, does not change the bottom line when it comes to whether Duffy has been consistent in his stance. His position has been that, just like the 50 states, Puerto Rico itself should not be allowed to declare bankruptcy. Rather, municipalities and governmental units in the territory should be placed on par with those in the 50 states, and they should be allowed to declare bankruptcy. Our rating From the beginning, Duffy warned against allowing Puerto Rico as a territory to declare bankruptcy. Despite the suggestion of the radio ad, the bill he is sponsoring does not allow bankruptcy for general obligation bonds. We rate Duffy’s position on the issue of what to do about Puerto Rico’s debt as No Flip.",/factchecks/2016/may/13/sean-duffy/did-sean-duffy-flip-flop-what-should-be-done-about/

Is an arm of the World Bank tied to 8-fold rise in water rates in Manila?
","If a city can’t provide safe drinking water, should it turn the whole operation over to a private company? No, we’re not talking about Flint, Mich. This concerns the southeast Asian city of Manila, the capital and biggest city in the Philippines. In 1997, officials in the Pacific island nation set up not one but two private companies to deliver water to homes and businesses. One of those companies has been a financial success. So healthy, that the private banking arm of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, became a part-owner in 2004 for about $15 million. During a hearing on April 27, 2016, the International Finance Corporation’s role drew criticism from Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis. ""In Manila, for example, when the IFC, the development arm, took an equity position in the water company, water rates were raised up to 845 percent,"" Moore said. She was pressing a Treasury Department official on how to make international development banks more accountable. We decided to see whether residents had to pay more than eight times as much for their water once the International Finance Corporation bought a stake in the Manila Water Company. What we found, between 2004, when the IFC bought its share of the company, and 2012, is that rates did climb. But they only rose by about 170 percent, not the 845 percent Moore cited. Moore’s office said she relied on a 2010 resolution from the Philippines House of Representatives. Making apples-to-apples comparisons of rates is challenging. The soundest data we could find was in a 2013 report from local regulators, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System. This table shows the average price (in Philippine pesos) of a cubic meter of water at three points, when privatization took place in 1997, when the IFC gained part ownership in 2004 and 2012. 1997 2004 2012 Average rate 
(pesos/cubic meter) 4.02 14 38.12 Change from 1997 (percent) 248% 848% Change from 2004 (percent) 172% PolitiFact analysis of a 
typical bill Typical household bill 
(1997 pesos) 121 295 537   As you’ll see, the increase from 1997 to 2012 was 848 percent, near the increase Moore claimed. The 2010 resolution from the Philippines House of Representatives said that the cost of water rose by 845 percent between 1997 and 2009. The problem, though, is that the IFC did not become a part owner until 2004. The rate increase between that year and 2012 was about 170 percent. There are a few other important dimensions to bring into the picture. A better water service By the mid 1990s, Manila’s public water system was in crisis. About a third of the city’s residents, roughly 3.5 million people, had no running water. Leaks and water theft were literally draining the pipes. Water pressure could drop at any moment, leaving many with a completely unpredictable water supply. Cholera and infection-related diarrhea were on the rise. The Philippine government turned to the World Bank, which brought in the International Finance Corporation to devise a privatization plan. Gregory Pierce, a lecturer at Urban Planning at UCLA, told us privatization ""was a big fad in the early to mid 1990s."" The IFC’s role was advisory, but the framework it crafted produced the circumstances that exist today. Major capital investments, and rising rates to pay for them, were part of the plan. In other words, while Moore linked her comment to the year when the IFC took an equity position, its involvement dates back years earlier to the launch of a privatized water system. The Manila metro area was divided into two zones, and an international consortium, that included the American Bechtel Corporation, was the winning bidder for the eastern section. The company was called Manila Water. Manila Water soon spent over $300 million to install more than 1,200 kilometers of piping. The good news is, by every measure, quality and reliability went up. In 2007, an article in Economics and Management in Developing Countries reported that by 2002, the fraction of people with service had gone from about 60 percent to over 80 percent. Unlike before 1997, the water moving through the pipes met government drinking water standards. Leaks were repaired twice as quickly and while service might drop out, the average went from taps running 17 hours a day before the change to 21 hours a day afterward. As the authors of the journal article put it, ""If one goes by the numbers for water coverage, availability and quality, water privatization in Metro Manila seemed to have worked. However, water rates had risen dramatically during the same period."" Frederick Jones, a spokesman for the International Finance Corporation, said the benefits have been widely shared. ""While tariffs have increased for some residents of Manila, many of the people not previously connected to water services were poor families, who were forced to pay $3 a cubic meter for bottled water on the open market,"" Jones said. ""Today, the average tariff in Manila is $1.30, but this tariff is helping subsidize the poorest families, who now only pay 18 cents per cubic meter."" Two ways to look at price hikes Moore couched her claim in terms of the percentage rise in the cost of water. But Nathaniel Meyer, a senior organizer with the advocacy group Corporate Accountability International, said from a household perspective, what really matters is how much you pay. ""If a family in Manila in 1997 paid 4 pesos for their water and it’s gone up in absolute pesos, that's going to leave them less for food, health care, clothes for the kids and everything else,"" Meyer said. We ran the numbers for a household paying the average rate on 30 cubic meters of water a month. In its publications, Manila Water says 30 cubic meters is the amount used by the typical household. In inflation-corrected pesos, the typical bill went up about 20 percent faster each year after 2004 than before. Our ruling Moore said that when the International Finance Corporation became a part-owner of Manila Water, rates rose 845 percent. The source cited by Moore’s staff undermines that number. The International Finance Corporation bought its stake in 2004. Between 2004 and 2012, rates rose about 170 percent. Moore incorrectly used a figure that would apply to the period from 1997 to 2012. However, the IFC crafted the plan for privatization in the first place. All parties knew that important capital investments would follow, and that rates would go up. It is also true that in terms of the actual size of a family’s water bill, rates rose faster each year after the IFC bought its share than before. Moore wrongly pegged the rate increase to the date of IFC’s equity position, but the development corporation played a key role from the start. We rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c3d24c04-cbbd-4742-8c79-10b2e96cd9d4",/factchecks/2016/may/12/gwen-moore/arm-world-bank-tied-8-fold-rise-water-rates-manila/

Bill McRaven of University of Texas says UT students graduate with less than $21,000 in debt
","The University of Texas System’s chancellor suggests that if you’ve been a UT undergraduate--on any campus--you’re likely not buried in school debt. Bill McRaven prefaced his January 2016 declaration: ""I’m proud to say, and I checked these numbers for about the hundredth time yesterday, because I always make sure that I don’t get my pants on fire in terms of that Pants on Fire meter."" ""But across the University of Texas,"" McRaven told the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, ""our undergraduates..., their debt is less than $21,000… That’s probably one of the lowest debts across the nation--and so we’re proud of that."" We couldn’t resist checking his figure, finding it has a basis yet there are paths to a range of figures, especially if you bore in on graduates of particular UT institutions. A 12-year median Asked what McRaven was recalling, a UT System spokeswoman told us the median cumulative debt for certain UT graduates was $20,755 (meaning half the graduates had more debt, half had less) in inflation-adjusted 2014 dollars. By email, Jenny LaCoste-Caputo said McRaven’s figure, based on data collected for graduates from UT institutions over the dozen years through 2012-13, reflected borrowing related to tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies as well as transportation and other expenses. Those figures show some graduates accumulating far less debt, others more. For instance, some 10 percent owe $5,415 or less while at the high end, 10 percent owe $42,051 or more. LaCoste-Caputo, asked why McRaven highlighted the 12-year median, said the chancellor seeks to show that a UT degree pays off. She said that according to a UT System analysis, median annual earnings of graduates 10 years after graduation run about $60,000. Whatever the chancellor's intention, 12 years struck us as a pretty wide time window. So to our request, LaCoste-Caputo provided the median debt for loan-taking graduates of UT schools solely for the latest available year, 2012-13. That median debt load was $23,350, some 13 percent greater than the 12-year median. Transfer students not considered We confirmed another wrinkle: UT's median debt figures don’t reflect every graduate or loan. LaCoste-Caputo said the median calculations consider only graduates who also had been first-time students on a UT campus--not reflecting any debts accumulated by transfer students from non-UT institutions such as community colleges. For the dozen years, she advised, McRaven relied on data for 43,900 bachelor’s degree recipients and didn’t have sufficient data for 82,380 degree recipients who borrowed money while attending other schools besides UT. Put another way, she said, the median figure McRaven touted considers information for about 35 percent of the student-borrowers to get a UT degree in the period. Brace yourself. We're about to share other ways of looking at UT student debt plus some national figures. Another Texas analysis More research made us think a graduate's debt level can be influenced by which UT school she or he embraces. On behalf of the coordinating board, spokeswoman Kelly Carper Polden replied to our email queries by saying loan-taking UT students who graduated in the 12 months through August 2015 had average debt ranging from less than $17,500 to more than $39,000, counting state, federal and reported parent loans. Average Debt, Loan-Taking Graduates, University of Texas Schools, Fiscal 2015 Institution Average Debt UT-Arlington $24,970 UT-Austin $39,305 UT-Brownsville $23,634 UT-Dallas $24,028 UT-El Paso $22,593 UT–Pan American $17,264 The University of Texas of the Permian Basin $20,516 UT-Rio Grande Valley* Not Available* UT-San Antonio $30,406 UT-Tyler $28,474 SOURCE: Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (chart fielded by email from Kelly Carper Polden, assistant director of communications, May 6, 2016) *UT-RGV, bringing together the former UT-Brownsville and UT-Pan American, started operations in September 2015. From beyond Texas, Sandy Baum of the Washington, D.C.-based Urban Institute nudged us to information on a federal website enabling us to peg the median federal-loan student debt for 2013-14 graduates from each of nine UT campuses. By our calculation, the median across the UT schools averaged $18,465. Graduates of UT-Pan American had the lowest median debt, $12,994. Graduates of UT-San Antonio had the biggest, $23,723. Also, Sara Goldrick-Rab at the University of Wisconsin responded to our inquiry by suggesting we consider work by the Oakland-based Institute for College Access & Success, an independent nonprofit that says it works to make higher education more available and affordable for people of all backgrounds. Next, the institute’s Matthew Reed said by email that according to data volunteered by the majority of U.S. colleges to Peterson’s, which publishes a college guide, among 2013-14 graduates from UT schools who took out loans, the average debt level (not adjusted for inflation) ranged, by campus, from $14,900, at UT-Pan American, to $27,337, at UT-San Antonio--with average debt at the Austin flagship being $27,207. An institute spreadsheet also showed average loan totals for graduates of UT-Dallas ($19,613), UT-Arlington ($23,210) and UT-El Paso ($24,000). All told, these figures suggest a 2013-14 average debt level for loan-taking UT graduates of $22,711--about $2,000 more than McRaven’s 12-year inflation-adjusted median figure. But the ""transfers"" caveat persists: Reed said that like McRaven, the institute was limited to data for students who went to the same institution before graduating; no transfers considered. What gives? Reed said colleges resist efforts to collect data for all students, saying it’s unfair to hold them accountable for students who borrowed while studying elsewhere. Separately, Mark Kantrowitz, a Chicago-based expert, said by phone that Congress even barred the government from tracking individual students and their respective debt loads. ""Not perfect data,"" Reed said, ""but they’re the best available."" UT versus nation McRaven also said UT students probably carry smaller debt loads than peers nationally. Asked how he reached that judgment, LaCoste-Caputo pointed out the College Board’s Trends in Student Aid 2015 report, which states that in 2012-13, the average cumulative debt for bachelor’s degree recipients from U.S. public, four-year institutions was $25,500. Worth noting: 61 percent of students who earned bachelor’s degrees in 2013-14 from the public or private nonprofit four-year institutions at which they began their studies graduated with debt, the report says. Such borrowers, it says, averaged $26,900 in loans, reflecting an inflation-adjusted increase of 17 percent over a decade. Separately, we spotted an institute web page stating the average debt of 2013-14 graduates of public four-year institutions was $25,902 with the average debt in federal loans equaling $22,901. The average debt for graduates of private nonprofit institutions was $29,567, according to the page. And by our read of the spreadsheet provided by Reed, the average debt for loan-taking graduates of six reporting UT schools exceeded the average debt for graduates from about 200 other institutions nationally. But the UT average trailed the average for graduates of about 910 U.S. colleges and universities. By phone, Kantrowitz said  that by his estimate, debt accumulated by 2015 loan-taking U.S. college graduates averaged $35,000, counting federal and private-institution loans. Worse: Kantrowitz said he projects 2016 graduates to average about $37,000 in accumulated debt. We wondered why his figures considerably outpace estimates from others. Kantrowitz said he rolls in data from more institutions, public and private. He also emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that about 70 percent of recent graduates carry some school-loan debt. Our ruling McRaven said that across the UT system, undergraduate student debt ""is less than $21,000… probably one of the lowest debts across the nation."" The experiences of graduates over a dozen years supports this figure. Data also support the notion that UT graduates wind up less debt-burdened than most peers. Still, UT's analysis (like others) doesn't account for debts piled up by transfer students. Significantly too, UT graduates in 2012-13 had a median debt of $23,350, which outpaces the long-term figure aired by McRaven by more than $2,000. We rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Ed Gillespie says GOP shut out from Va. statewide offices for first time in 40-plus years
","Ed Gillespie says he’s convinced that the Republican philosophy of ""limited, effective"" government is just what Virginia needs. But there’s a hitch. ""To enact those policies, we must first win elections because for the first time in over 40 years, Republicans don’t hold a single statewide office,"" Gillespie, who plans to run for governor next year, said in an April 30 speech at the GOP state convention. We wondered if this really is the first time in more than four decades that no Republican holds any of Virginia’s five statewide offices. The 2013 sweep in statewide elections for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general by Terry McAuliffe, Ralph Northam and Mark Herring, respectively, left Democrats in full control of Virginia’s executive posts. Democrats Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, meanwhile, hold Virginia’s two U.S. Senate seats. If you’re a political junkie, stop here for a minute. Try to figure out the last full year - before 2014 - that Democrats had such a lock. Now, let’s go back in time together. From 2010 through 2013, Gov. Bob McDonnell, Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling and Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli - all of them Republicans - held the state’s top three positions. Actually, the GOP had at least one of those three offices every year since the early 1990s, when Democrats held them all under Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, Lt. Gov. Don Beyer and Attorney General Mary Sue Terry. But even with no Republicans holding an executive post in state government, the GOP back then had John Warner, who served in the U.S. Senate from 1979 until 2009. You have to go back to 1969 to find the last full year when Democrats held all five statewide posts. That year, Gov. Mills Godwin, Lt. Gov. Fred Pollard and Attorney General Robert Button were in office along with U.S. Sens. Harry F. Byrd Jr. and William B. Spong Jr. Later that year, Linwood Holton became the first Republican elected governor in Virginia. He was inaugurated Jan. 17, 1970. Byrd and Godwin, like many Southerners, abandoned the Democratic Party in the early 1970s as it moved to the left. Byrd became an independent in 1971 and, two years later, Godwin was re-elected governor as a Republican. Why is the GOP now frozen out of statewide seats?  A key reason is demographics, said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia. Much of Virginia’s population growth in recent decades has been in urban and suburban areas that tend to vote Democratic, such as Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads and greater Richmond, as well as in university towns, Sabato said. ""This really started in the 1960s, in a big way,"" he said. Voters in rural parts of the state remain receptive to socially conservative ideas that Republicans embrace, but ""that’s not where the people are,"" Sabato said. Our ruling Gillespie said this is the first time in more than 40 years that a Republican doesn’t hold a single statewide office. Actually, you have to go back almost 47 years to find the last time the GOP didn’t hold at least one statewide seat.

Donald Trump falsely claims Hillary Clinton 'wants to abolish the 2nd Amendment'
","Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton of coming after your guns and your right to them. ""Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment,"" Trump said May 7 at a rally in Washington. ""Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away, and she wants to abolish the Second Amendment."" We asked the Trump campaign for evidence for this claim, but they didn’t get back to us. The Clinton campaign vehemently denied it. ""Of course Hillary Clinton does not want to repeal the Second Amendment,"" Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said. We found no evidence that Clinton has ever advocated for repealing or abolishing the Second Amendment. Schwerin’s comments are largely consistent with what Clinton has said in the past few years about the right to bear arms. However, gun rights advocates argue that it’s reasonable to infer from a few of Clinton’s comments that she wants to roll back the Second Amendment as it’s currently interpreted. Straight shooting on the campaign trail In both her 2008 and 2016 White House bids, Clinton has called for stronger background check requirements all the while affirming her support for the right to bear arms. Clinton does want to keep guns out of the hands of ""people we all agree shouldn't have them — domestic abusers, violent felons, and dangerously mentally ill people,"" said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Violence. But Trump’s charge exaggerates the controls she wants to put in place and ignores what she has said on the record. ""I believe in the Second Amendment. People have a right to bear arms. But I also believe that we can common-sensically approach this,"" she said in a January 2008 Democratic presidential debate. In response to the on-air murders of a news crew in Virginia in August 2015, she said, ""We are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures, so whatever motivated this murderer ... we will not see more needless, senseless deaths."" More recently, she tweeted in April 2016,  ""We can protect our Second Amendment rights AND take commonsense steps to prevent gun violence. It’s just a question of whether we choose to."" Setting aside the bulk of Clinton’s comments on protecting the Second Amendment (examples here, here, here, here, here and here), we’ll now go over two points that some gun rights advocates and experts say gives Trump’s charge some credence. Two smoking guns? Clinton riled the gun lobby with two eyebrow-raising comments last fall. Clinton said in October 2015 that a national gun buyback program like Australia’s compulsory program was ""worth looking into."" After a gunman killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in 1996, Australia banned semiautomatic and automatic weapons and enacted a mandatory buyback of the newly prohibited guns. That program is ""incompatible with private ownership of guns,"" said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Dave Kopel, a pro-gun rights attorney and research director of the conservative Independence Institute in Denver, equates her musing about Australia’s program as ""wanting to abolish the Second Amendment."" (The NRA shares this view.) The full context of Clinton’s response, however, suggests she may have misspoken or not fully understood Australia’s program, as she also evoked voluntary buybacks as potential models for a U.S. program. ""Communities have done that in our country. Several communities have done gun buyback programs. But I think it would be worth considering on the national level if that could be arranged,"" she said, before comparing the buybacks to Cash for Clunkers, the Obama administration’s voluntary vehicle trade-in program. Second, Clinton said she disagrees with the the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down Washington’s handgun ban and recognized that the Second Amendment applies to the individual’s right to bear arms. ""The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment,"" she said in a leaked recording of a private fundraiser. Volokh called the comment ""a smoking gun"" that bolsters Trump’s charge. Reversing Heller, said Kopel, would be a huge blow to the individual right to bear arms  They both pointed out that former Justice Department officials under President Bill Clinton and his appointees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued in Heller that gun regulations do not violate the Second Amendment because it primarily pertains to a well-regulated militia and not the individual right to bear arms. Put both comments together, and Trump is correct, said NRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter. UCLA Second Amendment expert Adam Winkler, meanwhile, said that the accuracy of Trump’s charge depends on Clinton’s grounds for rejecting Heller. (According to news reports from the 2008 election, she supported Washington’s handgun ban.) ""If she thought the reasoning was wrong, but the result right, then she would fit in with a number of strong pro-gun advocates,"" he said. ""If, however, she thought there should be no protection for gun rights, then Trump's claim comes closer to the truth."" The Clinton campaign told us Clinton ""believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe."" This suggests Clinton disagrees with the court declaring the district’s ban on handguns unconstitutional, not necessarily the individual right itself — a position that’s more or less in line with the George W. Bush administration’s position on Heller of recognizing the right but allowing reasonable curtailment. Our ruling Trump said, ""Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment."" We found no evidence of Clinton ever saying verbatim or suggesting explicitly that she wants to abolish the Second Amendment, and the bulk of Clinton’s comments suggest the opposite. She has repeatedly said she wants to protect the right to bear arms while enacting measures to prevent gun violence. Gun advocates say Trump’s claim is backed up by Clinton’s openness to a gun buyback program and her disagreement with a Supreme Court decision on the Second Amendment. But whether or not these two cherry-picked comments actually reveal Clinton’s intentions is a matter of interpretation. For this claim to hold water, the support for Second Amendment abolition needs to be more direct. So we rate it False.",/factchecks/2016/may/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-claims-hillary-clinton-wants-/

Donald Trump says Germany now riddled with crime thanks to refugees
","After his GOP opponents dropped out of the race, Donald Trump was asked on NBC Nightly News if he would soften his opinions on immigration. ""As you try to appeal to the entire country, do you stand by them? Do you stand, for example, by the idea of a ban against foreign Muslims coming in?"" asked anchor Lester Holt. ""I do,"" said Trump. ""We have to be vigilant. We have to be strong. We have to see what's going on. There's a big problem in the world. You look what's happening with the migration in Europe. You look at Germany, it's crime-riddled right now."" A reader asked us to check if Trump was accurately characterizing what is going on in Germany in the wake of the German government's willingness to accept migrants, particularly its decision in August to waive rules for Syrian refugees seeking sanctuary. About 1.1 million arrived last year from the Middle East, Asia and Africa. We emailed Trump's spokeswoman to ask for the source of his claim, but we didn't hear back. When something is riddled, it's filled with something undesirable. When a body is riddled with bullets, it has a lot of bullets. Without knowing the precise point at which a city is ""riddled"" with crime, we'll look at the data to see if Germany now has a lot of crime. Germany's crime rate, particularly violent crime, is far lower than in the United States. The U.S. murder rate, for example, is nearly six times higher than Germany's, according to the most recent report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Government data show that despite a 440 percent increase in migrants, crime among that group only increased by 79 percent last year. We found out that the German government has repeatedly studied the question of crime and migrants. According to the Bundeskriminalamt, also known as the Federal Criminal Police Office or BKA, crimes by immigrants rose 79 percent in 2015. But at the same time, the number of refugees in the country rose more than fivefold — by 440 percent. In other words, the typical German was more likely to engage in crime than the average migrant. Not only that, the BKA found that the increase was in the first half of 2015. The rate then leveled off during the second half of the year, the period with the greatest influx of refugees, according to the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle. Nonetheless, in terms of raw numbers, that's 92,000 more crimes committed by migrants than in previous years. Instances of assaults, robberies and ""predatory extortion,"" a classification that includes threatening behavior, doubled over 2015. Smaller offenses, such as theft (mostly shoplifting), forging paperwork to get money and riding on public transport without paying the fare, nearly doubled. According to Die Welt (The World), a national German newspaper, most of the crimes committed by refugees are related to theft or trying to ride on public transport without tickets. Fewer than 1 percent, or less than 1,000, are sex crimes, in spite of social media rumors. However, concern over sex crimes peaked New Year's Eve amid widespread reports of groups of drunken North African migrants — Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco — sexually assaulting hundreds of women in Cologne and other cities. Those reports dovetailed with a 2014 study that found 40 percent of refugees from that region had gotten into legal trouble within 12 months of their arrival versus 0.5 percent of Syrians. A later analysis also revealed that migrants from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan were much less likely to be charged with a crime than migrants from other regions such as the Western Balkans, demonstrating that you can't lump all migrants together. Groups concerned about the influx of migrants believe that the government may not be giving the full story. The reports that migrants are generating less crime than other Germans have been met with some criticism. Data from a few states were not included, for example, and the New Year's Eve sexual assaults didn't make it into the latest report. It should also be noted that some of the additional crime has consisted of attacks on migrants and migrant camps. By the end of October, the number of attacks against shelters for asylum seekers had tripled compared to the count for all of 2014. When we compared the U.S. State Department's annual reports on German crime and safety from 2014 to 2016, we found that the low-to-medium risk in 2014 had, by the 2015 report, risen to a medium rating for most cities. The 2016 report specifically mentions the refugee problem: ""While the 2014 statistics (the latest available) for Germany are of interest, they fail to capture any effect that the approximately 1 million refugees and asylum seekers who arrived in country in 2015 may have had on crime."" It quotes some alarming statistics from the first quarter of 2015, but, as we've noted, the German government has released more up-to-date information that shows the initial refugee crime leveled off in the latter half of 2015. The crime and safety report also says, ""A number of ranking police officers have questioned the accuracy of the statistics being provided, specifically related to crimes taking place within refugee camps or being committed by refugees."" But overall, ""To our knowledge, there have been no large-scale empirical studies that have shown a connection between large-scale immigration and spikes in crime. In fact many studies show the opposite,"" said Natalia Banulescu-Bogdan, assistant director of the international program at the Migration Policy Institute and a fellow at MPI Europe in Brussels. ""It is important to be very careful about causation versus correlation,"" she said. Youth unemployment, being forced to wait while seeking asylum or trying to reunite with family members can increase tensions, but conditions such as youth unemployment can spark crime among non-migrants as well. ""There is nothing to suggest, however, that there is anything specific to refugee populations in general, or to those seeking asylum in Europe in particular, that predisposes them to crime,"" said Banulescu-Bogdan. ""In fact the opposite is more likely to be true, because there is so much more riding on their ability to avoid encounters with police and jeopardize their future in the country."" Our ruling Trump said Germany ""is crime-riddled right now"" because of migration to Europe. There are more criminal acts in Germany these days because there are more people, thanks to the influx of 1.1 million refugees in 2015 alone. But the data suggest that the refugees tend to be better-behaved than the typical German. Even if you presume that refugee-related crime is underreported for political reasons, we could find no evidence in German media reports that the country warrants Trump's riddled-with-crime characterization. Because his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Meist Falsch — Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/de3b3f76-de96-4103-8010-4a5d036cb6f6",/factchecks/2016/may/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-germany-now-riddled-crime-thanks/
