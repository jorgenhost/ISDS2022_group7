Did Mitt Romney's Massachusetts rank 47th in job creation?
","
Repeating a favorite talking point, speakers at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., took aim at Mitt Romney’s job-creation record as governor of Massachusetts.

""By the time he left office, Massachusetts was 47th in the nation in job creation,"" said Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, the Democrat who succeeded Romney in 2006.

This claim has been an old chestnut on the campaign trail since last year; we first rated it when President Barack Obama’s campaign adviser, David Axelrod, made it in June 2011. We rated it Half True then, and Half True again a year later. It became such a common talking point for Democrats the Romney campaign came up with a counterattack -- that Massachusetts under Romney initially ranked last among states in job growth, but by the end of his governorship, ""we were in the middle of the pack."" We gave this claim a Half True as well.

As usual, we will follow our usual approach of looking at the claim in two parts: First, are the numbers correct, and second, how much was the change because of Romney's policies?

We used state-level statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source of employment data. We used figures for non-farm jobs, seasonally adjusted. And because the Massachusetts governor takes office in early January, we used the data for December of each year as a baseline.

We found that from December 2002 to December 2006, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states (not including the District of Columbia) in job growth. (We calculated that by using the number of jobs at the beginning and end of the period for each state to determine the percentage change and then ranking the states.) Only Ohio, Louisiana and Michigan fared worse.

So the number is correct.

But does Romney deserve credit for the job situation? This is an issue we've addressed often at PolitiFact with governors from many states. Economists have consistently told us that policies of a governor have a relatively small impact on a state's economy.

For instance, the country was coming out of a recession when Romney took office. And it's likely that Massachusetts emerged more slowly from that recession because its pre-recession numbers were disproportionately inflated by the technology bubble, said Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent group that analyzes fiscal trends in the state. A lot of those tech jobs never came back.

Widmer warned us when we first looked at Axelrod’s 47th-in-the-nation claim in June 2011 not to put too much stock in any governor's influence over their state's rate of job growth. The ability for governors to manage the state economy is vastly overrated, Widmer said. States are tied to larger economic forces, he added, and governors often claim too much credit when things are going well and no blame when things are going poorly.

Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, echoed that point.

""Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office,"" he said. ""Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job. A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began. The executive’s policies may have speeded or slowed the recovery around the margins, but the conditions that caused the recovery to begin were already present before the oath of office was administered.""

(As we’ve noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)

Our rating

It’s correct that Massachusetts ranked 47th of 50 in job creation on Romney’s watch. However, the Obama camp -- like the Romney camp in its rebuttal -- exaggerates Romney’s influence on the state job market. Governors simply don't have that much impact. We rated this claim Half True more than a year ago, and today, we still think it merits a Half True.

Julián Castro says Milken Institute named San Antonio nation’s top-performing local economy
","
Second-term San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro did not shy from celebrating his hometown during his keynote address to the Democratic National Convention. 
Addressing the delegates assembled in Charlotte, N.C., Castro said that San Antonio residents recognize the value of investing in pre-Kindergarten and student college loans. ""We're investing in young minds today to be competitive in the global economy tomorow,"" Castro said. ""And it's paying off. Last year the Milken Institute ranked San Antonio as the nation's top-performing local economy."" 
Castro made the same claim in his keynote at the Texas Democratic Party convention. In that June 8, 2012, speech -- which we’ve previously dipped into twice -- Julián Castro said his city’s investments in infrastructure and education paid off ""late last year when San Antonio was ranked as the top-performing local economy by the Milken Institute.""

Indeed, we confirmed, San Antonio topped Milken’s 2011 list of the nation’s best-performing large metropolitan areas, rocketing up from 14th place the year before. Its rise is part of a recent trend in which Texas cities have dominated the list as the nation recovers from the 2007-09 recession.

The economic think tank’s annual list, which Milken spokesman Conrad Kiechel told us by phone has been issued in its current form for ""more than a decade,"" was described in a Dec. 30, 2011, Texas Tribune news story as ""a ranking that measures American metropolitan areas based on their ability to create and sustain jobs.""

Milken’s 2011 report on the best-performing cities says the index gives priority to job and pay gains, then some weight to several technology measures in relation to national averages: the local growth in high-tech gross domestic product, the concentration of tech industries and how many of 25 specific tech industries are concentrated there. Some measures are weighed across five-year spans, to flatten out extreme swings, and the most recent year, ""to capture recent momentum."" 
  
In recent years, the Tribune said, ""companies have flocked to San Antonio, making it an economic center rivaling Houston and Dallas."" In contrast to those cities, though, ""San Antonio has attracted high-wage jobs, capitalizing on its booming medical research industry.""

The Tribune story said InCube and Medtronic were the latest bioscience companies to move to San Antonio, which was already home to global headquarters for Valero Energy, Clear Channel Communications, USAA insurers and the H-E-B grocery chain.

The San Antonio Express-News credited the city’s rise to reasons ""including military base realignment, drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale and the growth of health care"" in a Dec. 16, 2011, news story.

Texas cities held four of the top five spots on Milken’s 2011 big-cities list, with Austin/Round Rock at fourth. Back in 2008, Austin was Texas’ only top-five city, but the state claimed most of those slots in 2009, 2010 and 2011. The other chart-toppers for 2011 were No. 2, El Paso; No. 3, Fort Collins/Loveland, Colo.; and No. 5, Killeen/Temple/Fort Hood.

Texas’ rise in the ranks, the Express-News wrote, came partly because of downturns in other parts of the country. The story quoted research economist James Gaines of Texas A&M University’s Real Estate Center: ""Our growth rate and advancement isn't all that wonderful. We've managed to stay flat or have very small positives. But because everybody has so many negatives, we look so much better.""

A Philadelphia Inquirer columnist interviewed Milken’s chief research officer, Ross DeVol, and wrote Dec. 16, 2011 that ""Technology and energy explain why nine Texas cities placed in the top 25 of the 2011 Milken ranking.""

Our ruling

San Antonio hasn’t just been holding steady in the economic downturn; it’s been gaining ground, even compared to other Texas cities. Castro’s statement rates True.",/factchecks/2012/sep/05/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-milken-institute-named-san-anto/

Cory Booker blasts Chris Christie for slashing funding to Planned Parenthood, causing a reduction in health services
","Newark Mayor Cory Booker didn’t mention Gov. Chris Christie by name, but the Democratic leader took a shot at his Republican governor Tuesday for cutting funding for women’s health services.

Before the mayor made a speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., Booker appeared at a Planned Parenthood rally and blasted the GOP for denying women access to health care.

""Now I want to be very clear. I come from a state where we’ve seen what Republican leadership will do to things like Planned Parenthood,"" Booker told the crowd, according to a video posted on YouTube. ""We’ve seen it. The first budget that came out of our Republican leadership slashed funding to Planned Parenthood.

""It resulted in, it resulted in the reduction of hours, the elimination of days, elimination of access to women in my city and all over my state.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Booker’s claim is on target. Christie eliminated nearly $7.5 million for family planning services in his first budget for fiscal year 2011, and has rejected efforts by the Democrat-led legislature to restore that funding.

As we discovered in a previous fact-check, that reduction in funding led to the closure of six family planning clinics, including two facilities run by affiliates of Planned Parenthood.

Those clinics included the following: Westampton and Brown Mills locations run by the Burlington County Health Department; Planned Parenthood of Southern New Jersey’s Cherry Hill center; FamCare, Inc.’s Millville facility; the Bayonne Women’s Health and Family Planning Center; and Planned Parenthood of Greater Northern New Jersey’s Dover site.

Representatives of those clinics previously told us that state funding cuts forced the closures.

On three occasions, Christie has rejected efforts by the legislature to restore those family planning dollars. The first time occurred when the governor vetoed a bill passed by the legislature in June 2010 to restore the funding.

At the time, Christie said New Jersey residents have access to ""comprehensive reproductive health care services"" at other sites and the state can’t afford to ""provide duplicative funding for family planning centers.""

In June 2011, the legislature included the $7.5 million in the fiscal year 2012 budget sent to the governor. Christie eliminated that funding as part of his line-item vetoes, and the legislature couldn’t secure enough votes to override that veto.

Most recently, the legislature passed a bill in June to restore the funding, but Christie vetoed it.

Our ruling

At a Planned Parenthood rally, Booker went after Christie’s record of cutting funding for family planning services.

""The first budget that came out of our Republican leadership slashed funding to Planned Parenthood,"" Booker said. ""It resulted in, it resulted in the reduction of hours, the elimination of days, elimination of access to women in my city and all over my state.""

It’s true that Christie eliminated nearly $7.5 million for family planning services in the fiscal year 2011 budget, and has rejected efforts to restore that funding. That funding reduction led to the closure of six family planning clinics around the state.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Religion', 'Texas', 'Hank Williams Jr.']","
Hank Williams Jr. says Barack Obama is a Muslim
","
Country singer Hank Williams Jr., who prides himself on being politically incorrect, took a moment during a Sept. 2, 2012, concert in Fort Worth to hammer misgivings about President Barack Obama.

As reported by critic Thor Christensen, who reviewed Williams’ performance at the Stockyards Music Festival for the Dallas Morning News, Williams said to a less-than-unanimous cheer: ""We’ve got a Muslim for a president who hates cowboys, hates cowgirls, hates fishing, hates farming, loves gays, and we hate him!""

Most everything in the singer’s statement shakes out as matters of opinion, which can’t be fact-checked. PolitiFact also did not wade in after Williams compared Obama golfing with House Speaker John Boehner to Adolf Hitler playing with Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister. (After Williams made that October 2011 analogy, he no longer sang the theme song for ESPN’s ""Monday Night Football."")

However, his reference to Obama as a Muslim struck us as factually checkable.

Such claims also have been gauged before -- and found lacking in evidence.

As PolitiFact noted in an Aug. 26, 2010, story, the president’s memoirs and independent biographies indicate that Obama was not raised in a particular faith, but he became a Christian when he was in his 20s while working as a community organizer in Chicago.

Still, Obama had a Muslim grandfather, Hussein Onyango of Kenya, and his Indonesian stepfather, Lolo Soetero, was Muslim, as biographer Davis Maraniss has written. Also, as a boy Obama was instructed in Islam at a school in Jakarta. Later, Maraniss writes, many of Obama’s college friends were Muslim.

In a July 27, 2012, opinion article in The Washington Post, Maraniss said: ""None of this adds up to Obama being Muslim, except in the minds of conspiratorialists.""

His article continues: ""Obama never met his Kenyan grandfather. After infancy, he spent time with his Kenyan father only once, and in any case Barack Obama Sr. was an atheist. The truth is that Muslims had nothing to do with the rise of the Obamas of Kenya and that conservative evangelical Christians were essential every step of the way,"" Maraniss said. ""It was proselytizing Seventh-day Adventists who first came to the Obamas’ villages out near Lake Victoria at the start of the 20th century. They taught English and Western ways to the first wave of young boys from the Luo tribe, including Hussein Onyango. His son, the president’s father, was also educated at a missionary school. 
""Later, as a young adult, Barack Obama Sr. was mentored by a remarkable evangelical Christian, Betty Mooney, whose grandfather was one of the founders of Texas Christian University. Mooney, who went to Kenya in the late 1950s to spread the gospel and literacy, met Obama Sr. in Nairobi and hired him to translate some of her literacy books into the Luo tribal language. She encouraged and helped sponsor his coming to the United States and specifically to the University of Hawaii, where he met Stanley Ann Dunham,"" the president’s mother. ""One can say that President Obama would not exist except for evangelical Christians.""

Maraniss said that while ""living in Jakarta from ages 6 through 9, young Obama temporarily took the last name of his stepfather, Soetoro, for school purposes. He was listed as a Muslim on school documents because students were listed in the religion of their fathers.""

Referring to Obama’s stepfather and his mother, Maraniss continues: ""Lolo was not particularly religious; Stanley Ann was spiritual but not part of any formal religion. For most of his three-plus years in Indonesia, Obama attended a Catholic grade school. When his family moved to a better neighborhood in his final year, he went to the local grade school, one of the best in the city. The central doctrine taught at S.D. Besuki was not Islam but Pancasila, or five principles, of modern Indonesia, which evoked the unity of the islands on the vast archipelago, social justice and a belief in one God. Conservative Muslims detested Pancasila (a Sanskrit word revealing Indonesia’s Hindu heritage), insisting that it was too liberal and open to too many religions and interpretations.""

Obama has said that as a young adult, the churches in Chicago impressed him with their commitment to social justice and the hope they gave to the poor. ""It was because of these newfound understandings that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of Trinity United Church of Christ on 95th Street in the Southside of Chicago one day and affirm my Christian faith,"" Obama said in a 2006 speech. ""It came about as a choice, and not an epiphany. I didn't fall out in church. The questions I had didn't magically disappear. But kneeling beneath that cross on the South Side, I felt that I heard God's spirit beckoning me. I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth.""
   
The pastor of Trinity then was Jeremiah Wright, the minister from whom Obama distanced himself in his 2008 campaign, after video of some of Wright's more provocative sermons were aired on television and the Internet. The break between the two men was over Wright's comments about American foreign policy and race relations, not tenets of Christian doctrine.
   
Several independent reports have documented Obama's church membership and faith life. ""Along his Senate campaign trail (in 2004), Obama would never fail to carry his Christian Bible. He would place it right beside him, in the small compartment in the passenger side door of the SUV, so he could refer to it often,"" journalist David Mendell wrote in his 2007 biography Obama: From Promise to Power.
   
After the falling out with Wright, Obama said he intended to find a new church once the campaign was over. In office, though, Obama has not attended one church regularly. Instead, he has worshipped at various churches in the Washington, D.C., area, including the Allen Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church. He also has attended services at Camp David, the presidential retreat.

More recently, the White House posted a photo of the president and his family walking to St John’s on Aug. 19, 2012.
   
In April 2010, Obama hosted an Easter prayer breakfast at the White House and spoke of being inspired by Christ's resurrection, particularly in light of the human failings of selfishness and pride. ""It's not easy to purge these afflictions, to achieve redemption,"" Obama said. ""But as Christians, we believe that redemption can be delivered -- by faith in Jesus Christ. And the possibility of redemption can make straight the crookedness of a character, make whole the incompleteness of a soul. Redemption makes life, however fleeting here on Earth, resound with eternal hope.""

Obama also gave remarks at the April 2012 Easter prayer breakfast at the White House, saying the day was ""an opportunity for us to reflect on the triumph of the resurrection and to give thanks for the all-important gift of grace. And for me, and I’m sure for some of you, it’s also a chance to remember the tremendous sacrifice that led up to that day, and all that Christ endured -- not just as a Son of God, but as a human being.""

Obama also said that the struggle to fathom Christ’s ""unfathomable sacrifice makes Easter all the more meaningful to all of us. It helps us to provide an eternal perspective to whatever temporal challenges we face. It puts in perspective our small problems relative to the big problems He was dealing with. And it gives us courage and it gives us hope. We all have experiences that shake our faith. There are times where we have questions for God’s plan relative to us,"" Obama said, drawing laughter, ""but that’s precisely when we should remember Christ’s own doubts and eventually his own triumph.""

Our ruling

Obama is not a Muslim. This has been clear for years. This claim sets the woods Pants on Fire.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'George LeMieux']","
George LeMieux says Charlie Crist said Sarah Palin would do a 'great job'
","
On the eve of the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Charlie Crist -- Florida’s former Republican governor turned independent -- penned an editorial in the Tampa Bay Times endorsing President Barack Obama. And voila! He landed a gig speaking at the Democratic National Convention.

Crist’s decision to back Obama wasn’t totally shocking. Crist literally embraced Obama over the stimulus package in 2009, and a year later he was headed toward defeat in a GOP U.S. Senate primary against Marco Rubio. Crist fled the GOP for ""no party affiliation"" and still lost the 2010 Senate race. Now Floridians are wondering if Crist will officially turn blue and try to win back his old seat from Republican Gov. Rick Scott in 2012.

The latest step in Crist’s reinvention prompted Florida Republican leaders to rev up their Crist-bashing engines.

One of those attacks is coming from George LeMieux, Crist’s former campaign strategist and chief of staff. ""This isn't the Charlie Crist I knew,"" LeMieux wrote an editorial that ran in the Tampa Bay Times.

LeMieux was the person Crist picked to fill a suddenly vacant Senate seat back in 2009. LeMieux hoped to return to the Senate by challenging Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson in November, but he  dropped out of the Republican primary after lagging behind U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, now the nominee.

LeMieux zeroed in on the fact that during the general election in 2008, Crist was a cheerleader for Obama’s rivals.

""The Charlie Crist I knew eagerly endorsed and campaigned for Sen. John McCain against Barack Obama,"" LeMieux wrote. ""He put himself forward as a potential vice presidential running mate for McCain. When he was not successful, Crist applauded the pick of Sarah Palin and said she would do ‘a great job.’ ""

Here, we will fact-check whether Crist said Palin would do ""a great job"" when McCain chose her as his running mate, and if his support for the ticket was as full-throated as LeMieux claimed.

Crist praises McCain’s choice of Palin

Crist was an early backer of McCain’s presidential bid and was often mentioned as a potential running mate. But on Aug. 29, McCain chose Palin, then the governor of Alaska, as his running mate.

The Miami Herald noted at the time that Palin and Crist shared some traits: ""She and Crist were among only three Republican governors elected in 2006. They ran populist campaigns. And their poll numbers remain high in their states.""

Crist’s office released a statement praising McCain’s choice: ""Sen. John McCain has made a great pick in Gov. Sarah Palin. She has demonstrated tremendous leadership as the chief executive of her state.""

Crist went on national TV to praise McCain’s choice on the same day. CNN host Larry King asked Crist if he was disappointed that he wasn’t picked by McCain.

""No, I was impressed at Gov. Palin being picked. I think that, once again, Sen. McCain has shown his independent streak, his maverick status, his go-with-the-gut call. And I think he made a great choice in Sen. (sic) Palin. I think that she'll be a great candidate. I watched her speech today. I was very impressed with not only what she had to say, but the way in which she delivered. I thought she was very effective, very articulate. And she's very bright. I've had the occasion to meet her at some governor association meetings and she's a very impressive lady.""

When King pressed Crist about whether Republicans would be able to sell Palin as commander in chief, part of Crist’s response was: ""I think they will have no trouble talking about the attributes that Gov. Palin brings to the ticket. As I say, she is a governor, she has executive experience and I think she'll do a great job.""

Crist also described Palin as someone who is ""not afraid to take on the establishment, not afraid to take on big oil companies, not afraid to establish tremendous ethics legislation. She's a reformer, worked incredibly hard in Alaska and will work incredibly hard in Washington to do exactly the kinds of things that Sen. McCain wants to do for our country. And that is to move us forward, to stand up for people, to stand up for country first and to do whatever it takes to put the people before any partisan politics. She's also reached across the aisle, as Sen. McCain has done; worked with Democrats, independents and Republicans to make a difference to the people of her state....""

 Crist and Palin on the campaign trail

Crist campaigned alongside Palin in Clearwater and Jacksonville in October 2008 (here are some pics).

Crist warmed up the crowd for Palin in Clearwater on Oct. 6: ""It's giddy-up time. We've got to get the action going. … It's up to each and every one of you now, it really is. Sarah did her job on this night and brought it home. She is a great governor, she's one of us. She'll be a great vice president of the United States of America.''

On Oct. 22, 2008, Crist was interviewed about Palin on CNN.

Interviewer Kiran Chetry asked Crist: ""Are you fully confident that if anything were to happen to John McCain, Sarah Palin could take over as president from day one?

Crist: ""I think she would do a great job. I mean, realize that, you know, she really is the only executive that's running -- the only one who has been the head of the government in Alaska. She's held executive positions as a mayor, executive position as a governor. Made those kinds of decisions. I think she's ready.""

About a week after McCain-Palin lost, Crist didn’t jump on the blame-Palin bandwagon at the Republican Governors Association meeting in Miami. ""She carried the banner for our party extraordinarily well. It was a tough campaign,"" Crist said. He said his party lost because Obama was such a great candidate and the sour economy was a terrible drag on Republicans, the Tampa Bay Times Buzz blog wrote. But when Palin took the stage, he wasn’t standing with her, although he said that was because he was working on his own speech.

But sometimes love doesn’t last forever -- and the falling out was evident by the spring of 2010. As Crist lagged behind Rubio in the GOP Senate primary, it was clear Crist was considering leaving the Republican Party, and that would mean a break from Palin.

In 2010, Palin publicly praised Rubio, while Crist named her in a campaign ad that accused Rubio, Palin and the tea party of following a road to ""extremism.""

 Our ruling

LeMieux said that after Crist was passed over by McCain for vice president, ""Crist applauded the pick of Sarah Palin and said she would do ‘a great job.’ ""

Yep, that was the case in 2008. Crist had heaps of praise for her and campaigned for the McCain-Palin ticket. Crist had plenty of motivation: It gave him free national publicity, and if McCain-Palin had won, Crist would have had some powerful buddies.

It’s worth noting that Crist started backing away from his previous praise during his hard-fought loss to Rubio in the 2010 Republican primary for senate. In a campaign ad, he accused Rubio, Palin and the tea party of following a road to ""extremism."" 
And though the Truth-O-Meter isn’t in the business of making predictions, we think we are on safe ground to say that Crist won’t be praising Palin at the DNC.

Still, we found lots of evidence to support LeMieux’s statement. We rate his claim True.

Bob McDonnell says GOP platform has included an anti-abortion amendment to the constitution without exceptions for “30 years”
","Gov. Bob McDonnell, the leading architect of this year’s Republican national platform, was recently asked to explain why a plank calling for an anti-abortion amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not provide an exception for rape. Controversy over abortion flared in the days leading up to last week’s GOP national convention
when Todd Akin, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Missouri, said that ""legitimate rape"" rarely results in pregnancy because ""the female body has ways to shut that whole thing down."" Many Republican officials, including presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have called on Akin to withdraw from the race. Akin has apologized for his comment, but won’t end his campaign.

On Aug. 26, former Gov. Charlie Crist, R-Fla., endorsed President Barack Obama in this fall’s election. Crist, in a column in the Tampa Bay Times, wrote that the GOP has included ""the Akin amendment in the Republican Party platform, which bans abortion, even for rape victims.""

That same morning, McDonnell appeared on ABC’s ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos"" and said there is no Akin amendment. ""I tell you, that’s so far afield,"" he said about Crist’s charge. ""He’s wrong on the platform.""

McDonnell said the GOP’s platform that supports a constitutional amendment banning abortion and is silent on whether there should be exceptions for rape or other circumstances ""has been there for more than 30 years.""

""The details, certainly, are left to Congress, and ultimately, to the states and the people on how they ratify such an amendment and, more importantly, what they do at the state level,"" the governor said.

We wondered if this year’s plank seeking an anti-abortion amendment in the constitution really is no different than those of the last 30 years.

There are several mentions of abortion in the 2012 platform. The GOP opposes federal funding for the procedure and seeks a ban on partial-birth abortions.

The sweeping platform statement on abortion says, ""Faithful to the ‘self-evident’ truths enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment’s protections apply to unborn children.""

This wording has varied only slightly since 1984, when the plank read, ""The unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We therefore reaffirm our support for a human life amendment to the Constitution, and we endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children.""

In 1980, the GOP favored an abortion amendment and was silent on exceptions. The party, however, offered an olive branch to those who disagreed. The plank said, ""While we recognize differing views on this question among Americans in general -- and in our own Party -- we affirm our support of a constitutional amendment to restore protection of the right to life for unborn children.""

Abortion made its platform debut in 1976 at the first GOP national convention to be held after the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 establishing abortion rights nationwide. The platform said, ""The Republican Party favors a continuance of the public dialogue on abortion and supports the efforts of those who seek enactment of a constitutional amendment to restore protection of the right to life for unborn children."" Our ruling

McDonnell said the GOP’s platform that supports an anti-abortion amendment to the constitution is silent on whether there should be exceptions for rape or other circumstances ""has been there for more than 30 years.""

Uncle Sam barred from bargaining Medicare drug prices, Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin says, blaming rival Tommy Thompson
","
When it comes to the massive Medicare Part D prescription drug program, you’d think Uncle Sam would have pretty good leverage in negotiating drug prices.

But the government is actually barred from doing such bargaining, according to Democratic Wisconsin Congresswoman Rep. Tammy Baldwin -- who lays blame on her opponent for the U.S. Senate, Republican Tommy Thompson.

Baldwin attacked Thompson, who served as health and human services secretary under GOP President George W. Bush, in an Aug. 15, 2012, interview.

She told John ""Sly"" Sylvester, a liberal talk show host on WTDY-AM and -FM in Madison:

""We have written into law, under Tommy Thompson's watch, a prohibition for the federal government to be involved in negotiating with pharmaceutical companies for better prices for seniors for drugs. That's unbelievable. You know, if you buy in bulk, you get a better deal.""

Let's check both parts of Baldwin’s claim -- that the government is prohibited from negotiating on drug prices and that Thompson played a role in creating the ban.

Negotiating drug prices

Medicare Part D is a voluntary insurance program for prescription drugs for people on Medicare. Congress created it by passing legislation in 2003, although the program didn’t take effect until 2006.

Here is some background from PolitiFact National:

In rating as Half True a claim by former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum -- that Medicare Part D came in 40 percent under budget because of its design -- our colleagues explained that private insurance companies offer a variety of plans subsidized by the government, and beneficiaries get to choose the plan that's best for them.

PolitiFact National has also reportedon the program as part of its Obameter, which tracks promises President Barack Obama made as a candidate in 2008.

Since Congress approved the program, proposed by Bush, Democrats have groused that it was a huge giveaway for the pharmaceutical industry because it did not allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Obama vowed to change the program to allow Medicare negotiate lower prices. But he backed away from the pledge during negotiations over his health care reform bill, and no provision on negotiating drug prices was included in the bill that became law in 2010.

(That eventually led our colleagues to rate Obama’s pledge as a Promise Broken.)

That isn’t to say there isn’t any negotiating.

A July 2006 New York Times article cited by Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus reported that ""Congress -- in what critics saw as a sop to the drug industry — barred the government from having a negotiating role. Instead, prices are worked out between drug makers and the dozens of large and small Part D drug plans run by commercial insurers.""

Thompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir also cited the negotiating done by the various companies offering Medicare Part D plans, arguing it has resulted in the overall cost of Medicare Part D to be lower than projected.

(PolitiFact National found in June 2011, in rating Santorum’s claim, that the program came in under budget because fewer people than expected used it, drug spending increased less than expected and the program had encouraged use of generic drugs.)

But we’re not here to settle Nemoir’s claim; and one could argue, as Baldwin does, that costs could be even lower if the federal government did the negotiating.

When we checked back with Nemoir, he acknowledged that the federal government is prohibited from negotiating drug prices on behalf of Medicare Part D plans.

Thompson’s role

The second part of Baldwin’s claim is that the prohibition was put into law ""under Thompson’s watch"" -- indicating he didn’t unilaterally impose the ban, but played a role.

Kraus cited a number of news articles, including one in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that said Thompson was the Bush administration’s ""point man"" on getting Medicare Part D through Congress; and one in the Philadelphia Inquirer that said Thompson ""lobbied tirelessly"" for the plan.

Moreover, Nemoir acknowledged that the prohibition on the federal government was done under Thompson.

Our rating

Baldwin said federal law adopted ""under Tommy Thompson's watch"" prohibits the federal government from negotiating for ""better prices"" on prescription drugs for senior citizens.

Her reference was to the Medicare Part D prescription program, which Thompson lobbied for and which includes the prohibition she stated.

We rate Baldwin’s statement True.

Chris Christie claims he was the first governor to endorse Mitt Romney
","Before Gov. Chris Christie made his case in primetime last week for why Mitt Romney should be elected president, the governor pointed to his original endorsement in October as evidence that he truly believes in the Republican nominee.

Leading up to his keynote address Tuesday at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., Christie dismissed a New York Post article claiming he doubted Romney could defeat President Barack Obama. As part of his rebuttal, Christie repeated a line he's said before: he was the first governor to endorse Romney.

""I’ve spent since October of last year -- first governor in America to endorse him -- (running) around the country to 15 different states campaigning for him and raising money,"" Christie said in an interview Tuesday on ""CBS This Morning.""

""I didn’t do that ‘cause I had nothing else to do,"" Christie continued. ""I did it because I believe the guy’s the best guy to be president and that he can win.""

But PolitiFact New Jersey found that Christie’s claim is off. He was one of the first Republican governors to back Romney, but not the first. The governor's office did not respond last week to an email presenting our findings. Here are the facts:

A week after announcing he wouldn’t make a presidential run himself, Christie traveled to New Hampshire and endorsed Romney on Oct. 11, 2011.

""I’m here in New Hampshire today for one simple reason: America cannot survive another four years of Barack Obama, and Mitt Romney is the man we need to lead America and we need him now,"" Christie said during a news conference.

But about four months earlier, the Romney campaign announced he had the support of two other Republican governors: Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman and Idaho Gov. Butch Otter.

The campaign announced Heineman's endorsement in a June 10, 2011 news release posted on its website. ""Mitt Romney has a proven record of balancing budgets, keeping taxes low, and creating an environment for job growth,"" Heineman said in the news release. ""As a governor, I understand the challenges this country faces and Mitt Romney has the experience to meet those challenges."" In a June 20, 2011 news release on its website, the campaign said Otter would serve as co-chairman of Romney's Idaho Statewide Steering Committee. ""Mitt Romney has the experience needed to grow the economy and create jobs,"" Otter said in the release.

In the months ahead, news articles noted both governors’ endorsements.

""Romney has been endorsed by two governors, Dave Heineman of Nebraska and Butch Otter of Idaho, as well as one former governor, Colorado’s Bill Owens,"" according to a July 2, 2011 article on the Washington Post’s website.

A Politico article on July 16, 2011 pointed out how only a few governors -- including Heineman and Otter -- had handed out endorsements in the GOP presidential primary race:

""Only a small handful of Republican governors have endorsed in the presidential race, with Govs. Dave Heineman of Nebraska and Butch Otter of Idaho backing Mitt Romney, and Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal endorsing Newt Gingrich.""

In a Dec. 1 article in the New York Times, Heineman was identified as ""the first governor to endorse Mr. Romney.""

Our ruling

In light of a New York Post article claiming Christie doubted whether Romney could beat Obama, Christie claimed in a TV interview that he was the ""first governor in America to endorse"" Romney.

But about four months before Christie offered his endorsement, the Romney campaign announced he had the support of Republican governors in Nebraska and Idaho, and news articles noted both endorsements afterward.

Barbara Buono says Chris Christie embarked on a tour to demand the state Legislature approve a tax cut that disproportionately benefits the wealthiest people
","
Even before Gov. Chris Christie stepped on stage Tuesday night to deliver his keynote address at the Republican National Convention, New Jersey Democrats were criticizing the governor for exaggerating his success as the state’s chief executive.

Barbara Buono, a Senate Democrat from Middlesex County who has said she is ""seriously considering"" a 2013 bid for governor, took aim at Christie in an opinion column published in Politico late Monday night for making ""wildly optimistic"" revenue projections to prove New Jersey can afford a tax cut.

""Being honest about the numbers would undermine the ‘Endless Summer’ tour that Christie has embarked on to demand that New Jersey’s Democratic legislature approve an immediate tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest – regardless of whether the state can afford it,"" Buono wrote.

Here, however, it’s Buono that’s not being forthright.  

Although Christie initially proposed in January to cut income taxes 10 percent across-the-board over three years, he backed off that proposal before the start of his ""Endless Summer"" tour.

Christie now supports a plan based on a proposal from the Senate Democrats that would provide homeowners with an income tax credit based on their property tax bills.

Under the governor’s original plan higher income filers, who pay more in income taxes, would have benefited more than lower income filers.

But under the plan Christie now supports -- the plan he signed onto before kicking off his tour of New Jersey to blast Democrats for not approving a tax cut -- that’s not the case since some wealthy individuals would not even qualify for a tax cut.

On July 2, Christie conditionally vetoed a bill increasing the state’s top income tax rate on millionaires to enhance property tax relief payments for certain residents.

Christie suggested turning that legislation into a tax cut plan based on a proposal the Senate Democrats released earlier in the year.

Under Christie's new proposal, homeowners who earn $400,000 or less in taxable income would receive an income tax credit based on their property tax bill.

The credit would be phased in over four years, reaching 10 percent of the first $10,000 homeowners pay in property taxes. The maximum credit under the plan would be $1,000.

To support the state senator’s claim, Christina Zuk, Buono’s chief of staff, pointed to a July 26 news article that quotes Christie saying: ""I'm fighting for the tax cut now because you know, businesspeople are making decisions now about whether they're going to expand next year. The Democrats say we'll get to it. We'll get to the tax cut in December or January. Well that's going to be too late for 2013. Those businesspeople are already going to be deciding where they're going to invest their money, where they're going to spend.""

But Christie just says tax cut, not income tax cut. And still, he has publicly backed off his original proposal and put forth a plan based on a homeowner’s property tax burden.

It’s also worth noting that Christie’s conditional veto also recommended restoring a cut he made during his first year in office to the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit, a program which benefits lower income individuals. The conditional veto increased the state credit to 25 percent of the federal credit amount, up from 20 percent.

Our ruling

Buono said that Christie embarked on an ""Endless Summer"" tour to ""demand that New Jersey’s Democratic legislature approve an immediate tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest.""

Christie first proposed an across-the-board income tax cut that would have benefited higher income filers more than lower income filers.

But Christie has since backed off that plan.

Before the governor kicked off his ""Endless Summer"" tour, he signed on to a version of the Senate Democrats’ plan to give an income tax credit based on individuals’ property tax bills.

We rate Buono’s statement False.

Birthers sanctioned by federal judge for ‘frivolous lawsuit,’ claims Tennessee Democratic Party
","
The ""birthers"" – people who contend President Obama is not a ""natural-born citizen"" and therefore ineligible to be President -- are back in the news, right here in Tennessee.

The Tennessee Democratic Party issued a press release Tuesday, just as the Republican National Convention was getting underway, noting that sanctions were imposed against the plaintiffs in a federal court lawsuit in Memphis that essentially sought to block Obama’s name from this year’s election ballot in Tennessee.

The lawsuit was dismissed by U.S. District Judge S. Thomas Anderson in Memphis on June 20 after he concluded that none of the plaintiffs had established sufficient legal standing to assert their claims.

On Aug. 24, Judge Anderson granted a motion by the defendants, including the Tennessee Democratic Party, to sanction the plaintiffs for bringing a case in which their attorney, Van Irion of Knoxville, ""knew or reasonably should have known that the claims in this case had no basis in law,"" according to the judge’s order.

That order of sanctions was the subject of the party’s press release, which reported that not only had the judge dismissed a ""birther"" lawsuit but had sanctioned Irion ""for bringing a frivolous lawsuit.""

Irion is a Knoxville lawyer who, according to its website, co-founded Liberty Legal Foundation, which operates out of the same West Knoxville office suite as his law office. Irion is also listed as the foundation’s president and lead counsel. The website says the foundation has three big issues: ""Obamacare,"" immigration and the President’s legal status as a citizen.

Liberty Legal and three plaintiffs – John Dummett, Leonard Volodarsky and Creg Maroney – originally filed a lawsuit in state court in Memphis against an entity called the National Democratic Party of the USA Inc. (which apparently doesn’t exist). Irion later added as defendants the Democratic National Committee, the Tennessee Democratic Party, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (current chair of the Democratic National Committee) and state Democratic Party Chairman Chip Forrester.

Irion charged that the defendants violated state fraud statutes by falsely representing that Obama is qualified to be President, because he is not a natural-born citizen, and they should be blocked from filing papers with the secretary of state that will place his name on the Tennessee ballot.

The defendants successfully moved the case into federal district court in Memphis, where, after several months, Judge Anderson dismissed it in June. The defendants then filed the motions for sanctions against the plaintiffs. The judge issued his ruling on the motions Aug. 24, holding Irion personally accountable for a share of the defendants’ attorneys fees. Irion says he will ask the judge to reconsider and, failing that, will appeal the sanction order.

The Democrats’ press release is correct as far as it goes. A federal judge did sanction a Tennessee lawyer who argues that the President’s birth disqualifies him from serving – a ""birther"" in the current highly polarized political environment.

But the judge denied two of the defendants’ three motions for sanctions. However, both of the denials were made on more or less technical grounds – one because the defendants’ attorneys did not serve Irion with a copy of the sanction motion at least 21 days before it was filed with the court, as required by court rules, and the other because it addressed legal issues that the court did not need to rule on in dismissing the case.

The press release accurately described the tone of Judge Anderson’s sanction order, which concludes: ""Having determined that counsel for Plaintiff reasonably should have known that all Plaintiffs lacked standing to bring this suit, the Court holds that Plaintiffs’ claims were frivolous and without any arguable basis in law. As such, counsel for Plaintiff has multiplied the proceedings in this case unreasonably and vexatiously and should therefore be required to satisfy personally the attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by Defendants because of such conduct.""

The Liberty Legal Foundation website added an item Aug. 30 that accused Judge Anderson of lying: ""Judge Anderson not only did not address the outright lies of the DNC attorneys, he piled on his own lies in order to personally sanction Van Irion.""

Our ruling 
The Tennessee Democratic Party wanted to bring attention to Tennessee ""birthers"" challenging President Obama’s citizenship, and did so by pushing a press release claiming the judge found the claims so ""frivolous"" that he sanctioned the plaintiffs who brought them.

Anthony Gemma asks why U.S. military uniforms are made in China
","
The revelation that uniforms for the U.S. Olympic team were made in China caused quite a stir in July.

A similar issue came up Aug. 28 during the last half-hour of the 90-minute Providence Journal - WPRI-TV debate between Democrats Anthony Gemma and David Cicilline. The two will face off in the Sept. 11 primary as Gemma tries to take over Cicilline's seat in the 1st Congressional District.

When the candidates were asked whether they would consider an increased tax on Chinese imports, Cicilline went in another direction, expressing outrage over the foreign-made Olympic garments.

He had jumped on the issue when the controversy broke out, staging a photo-op at Northwest Woolen Mills in Woonsocket, which already makes berets for the U.S. military. The Olympic berets, he argued, could have easily been made there.

Then it was Gemma's turn.

""Mr. Cicilline refers to the Olympic clothing that happened, but how about uniforms?"" he said. ""How about our servicemen and women's uniforms that are manufactured in China?""

Just the thought of that happening put our knickers in a twist, so we set out on a not-so-covert mission to find out if it was true.

We e-mailed Gemma spokesman Alex Morash Thursday morning. When we didn't hear from him for several hours, we called him; the voicemail said he wasn't accepting calls or messages. We e-mailed him again Friday afternoon.

We also called the Pentagon and heard back from two other agencies.

One was the Air Force, whose spokeswoman Capt. Shannon Stoneking said in an e-mail, ""All of our AF uniforms are made in the USA.""

The other was the Defense Logistics Agency, which is responsible for procuring dress and utility uniforms, along with footwear, headgear, medals and insignia for all four branches of the U.S. military and the Coast Guard.

Spokeswoman Mikia Muhammad told us that ""DLA is mandated to buy 100-percent domestic material with all manufacturing completed in the United States."" It's not a policy. It's federal law.

The source is the Berry Amendment, USC, Title 10, Section 2533a, originally passed in 1941 to require a buy-American policy for the military. The latest version, which took effect Nov. 16, 2006, prohibits the Department of Defense from buying items of clothing ""unless they are wholly of U.S. origin.""

There are exceptions for small purchases and for cases in which supplies are urgently needed for troops in the field -- uniforms are unlikely to fall into that category. But even in such cases, it must be demonstrated that the items cannot be acquired in sufficient quantity from U.S. manufacturers.

One reason for the amendment: If the military were to use manufacturers in a foreign country, supplies could be cut off if problems arose between the two nations.

The Air Force addressed the issue in a 2009 news release examining why the United States didn't save money by letting major clothing companies provide uniforms. It quotes Maj. Michael Perry, clothing program manager for the Air Force: ""All of the uniform items -- service dress, PT, utility, flight suits -- must be manufactured in the U.S. The [Berry] amendment holds us to this in order to preserve not only American business, but national security.""

The only exception we could find in searching the Internet came in the wake of a 2000 decision to make black berets standard headgear for the Army. To issue them by the fall of 2001, a waiver was granted to allow several foreign firms, including some with facilities in China, to make 4.7 million berets. (But the first contract went to an Arkansas-based company that, according to a Congressional Research Service report, had been making military headgear since World War I.)

Because of the controversy that erupted, the Department of Defense decided not to distribute 618,000 berets made by a United Kingdom company operating in China, according to an undated story in Army Times. But 240,000 berets made in Sri Lanka were shipped.

The Gemma campaign never did respond to our inquiry.

Our ruling

Anthony Gemma, raising a question during an Aug. 28 debate appearance, said uniforms for U.S. soldiers ""are manufactured in China.""

But federal law prohibits the military from buying foreign-made uniforms without special authorization, stemming from the Berry Amendment of more than 70 years ago. We could find no evidence that any U.S. military uniforms are currently being made outside the United States.

Even a search of the Internet, where you can usually find ""support"" for just about any idea, uncovered only one instance, involving the Army berets, and that was more than a decade ago.

Perhaps some knockoff uniforms sold to the public come from foreign countries. But those aren't uniforms for our soldiers.

We don't know where Gemma buys his clothing, but regardless of its origin, we hope he has flame-retardant undies because the Truth-O-Meter rules this ridiculous claim a Pants On Fire!

"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Sam Olens']","
Olens make oral argument on health care ruling at GOP convention
","
Most Republicans were fuming after the U.S. Supreme Court announced its highly anticipated ruling on the federal government’s controversial health care law in June, which was widely seen as a win for President Barack Obama, who pushed it through Congress.

And so we found it surprising when Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens declared a victory of sorts in the case during his remarks at the Republican National Convention.

""We prevailed on our two main arguments,"" Olens said.

Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was alongside Olens, explained.

""The court agreed that the commerce clause of the Constitution does not allow the federal government to force you to purchase a product you don’t want,"" she said. ""The court agreed that the Constitution does not allow the federal government to force states to adopt a budget-busting expansion of Medicaid.""

The two attorney generals then led the convention hall in a call-and-response that voiced their displeasure with the law they derisively call ""Obamacare.""

We decided to weigh the evidence of this claim about victory on the two main arguments and put its accuracy on trial in our PolitiFact courtroom. Did Olens and Co. win on the commerce clause argument and their point about Medicaid?

The health care bill was signed into law by Obama in March 2010. The National Federation of Independent Business, 26 states, including Florida and Georgia, and some individuals joined forces to file a lawsuit to have the new law overturned. They argued it violated the U.S. Constitution on several fronts. The original complaint was filed in a federal court in Florida, led by Bill McCollum, who was then the state’s attorney general; Bondi was his successor. Olens was elected as Georgia’s attorney general in November 2010 and took office the following January.

Let’s first deal with the Medicaid claim. The law expands the number of people eligible for insurance. The law provides that the federal government will pay 100 percent of the costs of covering these individuals through 2016. In the following years, the federal payment level gradually decreases, to a minimum of 90 percent. The states that sued said the eligibility expansion would be a burdensome cost. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs.
   
""As for the Medicaid expansion, that portion of the Affordable Care Act violates the Constitution by threatening existing Medicaid funding,"" Chief Justice John G. Roberts wrote. ""Congress has no authority to order the States to regulate according to its instructions. Congress may offer the States grants and require the States to comply with accompanying conditions, but the States must have a genuine choice whether to accept the offer.""

Now, about the other part of Olens’ claim. Nels Peterson, Georgia’s solicitor general, said Olens was correct because the court agreed with the states’ argument that the individual mandate is not a valid exercise of Congress’ power under the commerce clause in the U.S. Constitution.

""Upholding the Affordable Care Act under the Commerce Clause would give Congress the same license to regulate what people do not do,"" Roberts wrote. ""The Framers knew the difference between doing something and doing nothing. They gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it. Ignoring that distinction would undermine the principle that the Federal Government is a government of limited and enumerated powers. The individual mandate thus cannot be sustained under Congress’s power to ‘regulate Commerce.‘ ""

Peterson said the court found another rationale to rule in favor of the individual mandate. Roberts wrote in the majority opinion that the individual mandate could stand, instead, because it may ""reasonably"" be characterized as a tax.

""Because the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness,"" Roberts wrote.

Peterson described Olens’ argument about the legal arguments a ""sophisticated, subtle point.""

""We won on our two main arguments,"" Peterson said, ""but lost anyway.""

Kathleen Burch, who teaches constitutional law at Atlanta’s John Marshall Law School, said the argument made at the convention was somewhat misleading because the federal government had argued in the lower courts that it had the power to apply an individual mandate under the Constitution’s taxing and spending clause.

""It is true that the primary, meaning leading argument, made by the states was that the individual mandate violates the commerce clause, but the federal government came back and said that it had the power under the taxing and spending clause,"" Burch said.

The plaintiff’s original complaint in Florida argued that the federal government could not impose an individual mandate ""under Article I of the Constitution of the United States, and cannot be upheld under the Commerce Clause … the Taxing and Spending Clause, id.; or any other provision of the Constitution.""

""In some ways [Olens’] argument was a little disingenuous because of its omissions,"" Burch said.

Again, Olens said the states prevailed on their two main arguments. The attorney general was correct that they won their arguments on the commerce clause and about Medicaid. But a part of the states’ original argument was also that the government couldn’t use the taxing and spending clause to make individuals buy health insurance. We believe that additional information is necessary to examine this claim.

""And at a time when nobody thought we'd ever see a new steel mill built in America, we took a chance and build one in the cornfield in Indiana. Today, Steel Dynamics is one of the largest steel producers in the United States. These are American success stories."" 
What did Michelle Obama say? 
Let’s Move!

We asked Romney’s campaign, and did some searching of our own.

The first lady didn’t offer a blanket endorsement of Bright Horizons, a major provider of employer-sponsored child care that’s been named one of Fortune magazine’s ""100 Best Companies to Work for in America.""

Rather, she singled them out for a mention in a June 2011 speech in Washington, D.C., as a new partner for her healthy-kids initiative, Let’s Move.

Her comments were publicized a year later in a Daily Caller article headlined ""Michelle Obama praised Bain Capital-backed child care company,"" as well as by ABC News and Fox Business News with Neil Cavuto.

She was ""singing the praises of a company called Bright Horizons last year"" saying it was ""it was beyond just first-rate,"" Cavuto said.

"['Health Care', 'Missouri', 'Chris Koster']","
Koster doesn't exaggerate income threshold to qualify for Medicaid
","Medicaid expansion in Missouri continues to be a major item of partisan contention within the state legislature, and now, candidates for governor have begun weighing in on the issue. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, recently tweeted: ""A single mother of two can’t qualify for basic healthcare through Medicaid if she makes more than $3,504 dollars a year.""  Koster’s statistic seemed pretty low, and we decided to take a closer look at the state’s Medicaid eligibility requirements. Qualifying for Medicaid in Missouri Across the country, eligibility for Medicaid is determined by a person's or family's yearly income compared to the Federal Poverty Level. Each state gets to decide how poor a household must be in order to qualify. Missouri covers children newborn to age 1 at 196 percent of the poverty level, meaning babies qualify as long as their families make just less than $40,000 dollars a year. For children 1 to 18 years old, Missouri covers them at 150 percent of the poverty level, or a yearly family income of about $30,000 dollars, according to Medicaid.gov. However, their parents are only covered if they make less than about 18 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, or about $3,600 dollars per year. The Missouri Department of Social Services charts income guidelines for parents to qualify for Medicaid; it shows the maximum income to qualify for a family of three is $301 dollars per month, or $3,612 dollars per year. We reached out to Koster’s campaign, but did not get a response as to where he got the number he tweeted ($3,504). Carolyn Orbann, associate professor of health sciences at MU, said it’s important to note that because Missouri has not expanded Medicaid, childless adults are not covered regardless of their poverty level. That’s not the case in 32 other states. ""The states that have expanded Medicaid qualify adults without children who make 138 percent of the poverty level — in some states, even those who make more than that,"" Orbann said. In other words, a woman without children in Illinois or Arkansas could make around $16,000 dollars per year and be covered by Medicaid, but a woman in Missouri with two children making above $3,600 would not. Even among states that have not expanded Medicaid, only Texas and Alabama had lower maximum income caps for parents on Medicaid than Missouri, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan information source on health issues. Kansas, which also has not expanded Medicaid, covers parents at 38 percent of the poverty level — more than double Missouri’s 18 percent of the poverty level standard. Our Ruling Koster may be off by a little more than $100 when it comes to the maximum income a single mother of two can have and still qualify for Medicaid. But his point that Missouri’s maximum yearly income for parents on Medicaid is one of the lowest in the nation is on target.

Mitt Romney praised Donald Trump's business skill in 2012, then flip-flopped in 2016
","Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee for president, burst onto the 2016 presidential campaign on March 3, giving a speech in which he tore into Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. ""Let me put it plainly: If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished,"" Romney said. Part of Romney’s speech addressed Trump’s record as a businessman. But many observers were quick to point out that Romney was singing a different tune when he accepted Trump’s endorsement early in the 2012 presidential primary season. This backstory came up when Romney appeared on the March 6 edition of NBC’s Meet the Press. ""Were you just sort of saying something you had to say four years ago in order to accept his endorsement?"" asked host Chuck Todd. Romney responded, ""Well, Donald Trump has made a lot of money for himself. And there’s no question that he’s got a lot of money in his pockets and has been successful on that score. But if you look at his record overall … you say, ‘OK, he made a lot of money for himself, he inherited a lot of money from his dad, but this is not a guy who is a self-made man, and this is a guy who’s crushed a lot of people along the way.’ "" Then, Todd asked Romney, ""Why’d you say so many things about his business career, when clearly you’re not impressed?"" Romney responded, ""You know, he’s made a lot of money for himself, and I’m gracious enough in a setting where someone has endorsed me to point out that he’s been successful and made a lot of money -- he has a lot of hotels and so forth. But you can’t also ignore the fact that he’s had a lot of failures."" We took a look at Romney’s remarks now and in 2012 to see whether he’s flip-flopped on Trump’s business record. Here’s what Romney said during his March 3 speech when he criticized Trump: ""But wait, you say, isn’t he a huge business success that knows what he’s talking about? No, he isn’t. His bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and the men and women who worked for them. He inherited his business, he didn’t create it. And what ever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there’s Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks, and Trump Mortgage? A business genius he is not."" And here’s what Romney said in 2012 at a news conference in Las Vegas with Trump at his side: ""Being in Donald Trump's magnificent hotel and having his endorsement is a delight. I'm so honored and pleased to have his endorsement. ... Donald Trump has shown an extraordinary ability to understand how our economy works to create jobs for the American people. He's done it here in Nevada. He's done it across the country. ... I spent my life in the private sector. Not quite as successful as this guy. But successful nonetheless."" Romney’s comments in Las Vegas are less specific than what he said in 2016 -- he never singled out specific business ventures, other than the hotel where the endorsement event was being held. Still, in 2012, Romney communicated an overall admiration for Trump’s business acumen, citing his ""extraordinary ability"" to understand how to create jobs ""across the country."" Romney even said that his own -- and not insubstantial -- business accomplishments were ""not quite as successful"" as Trump’s. When we contacted Romney’s camp, they urged us to review the entirety of Romney’s interviews after making his anti-Trump speech, including with NBC’s Matt Lauer, Fox Business News’ Neil Cavuto, CNN’s Gloria Borger, and Bloomberg’s Mark Halperin. Not all of these interviews addressed Romney’s views of Trump’s business skills -- in the Fox Business and Bloomberg interviews, for instance, he emphasized as a reason for his change of heart some of the things Trump has done and said during the campaign, such as his comments about Muslims and Mexicans, his criticism of former President George W. Bush and his mixed signals on condemning the Ku Klux Klan. But when Romney did address direct questions about his views on Trump’s business record, his message seemed to be that he was focusing on the positive part of Trump’s business history in 2012 and giving a more detailed, nuanced recounting in 2016. ""Oh, let me tell you, this is a guy if we look at the past, this is a guy who was very successful and made a lot of money for himself,"" Romney said in an interview on the March 6 Fox News Sunday. ""But at the same time, take a very close look and look how many small people he crushed along the way and how many failures he had."" And in his interview with Lauer, Romney said, ""Oh, he's a successful guy -- he's made a lot of money -- but he hasn't been uniformly successful, and he's far from a business genius. Look, Trump University, Trump steaks, Trump mortgage, Trump vitamin company. One after the other, failure after failure. So just because he's made a lot of money, one, you don't measure your life by how much money you've made, but just because he's made a lot of money doesn't mean that his economic policies are right for America."" Still, we see his comments four years apart as being fundamentally different in their message. Hearing Romney’s 2012 comments, a listener would not have picked up on the notion he asserted in 2016 -- that ""a business genius (Trump) is not."" We rate Romney’s view on Trump’s business record a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2016/mar/06/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-praised-donald-trumps-business-skill-2/

David Brooks is right: Primary turnout doesn't predict general election outcomes
","Republican candidates and party leaders have touted high voter turnout in the GOP primary as a good sign for the general election, but conservative New York Times columnist David Brooks isn’t so sure. ""There’s no correlation between primary turnout and wins in the fall in the last 11 elections,"" Brooks said on Meet the Press on March 6. Is Brooks right that the GOP’s numbers, which surpass Democratic turnout, mean little for the general election?   We didn’t hear back from Brooks, but the data shows and experts agree that more votes in the nominating contests aren’t necessarily harbingers of November victories. Turn out for what It’s important to note that not all 11 presidential cycles had competitive primary contests on both sides. Primary turnout was low in five elections simply because one party’s nomination was locked up by incumbent presidents, and thus not predictive of general election results. In 1984, for example, the Democratic primary turned out about three times more voters than the Republican primary. Nonetheless, President Ronald Reagan won re-election with almost 60 percent of the popular vote. In the six elections where there were contests on both sides, the party with the higher primary voter turnout won the popular vote just three times. In 1976, 1992 and 2008, Democratic primary turnout surpassed that of the GOP nominating race, and the Democratic candidates won the general election. Here’s a chart showing this, compiled with data from the Federal Election Commission and a few other sources. (Bold indicates the party that won in the general election, and an asterisk indicates an election where both parties had competitive primary contests.) GOP primary votes (% of voting age population) Dem primary votes (% of voting age population) 2012 19,530,335 (9.5 percent) 8,571,580 (6.1 percent) 2008* 20,790,899 (10.7 percent) 37,235,154 (21.0 percent) 2004 7,940,331 (6.3 percent) 15,975,066 (10.8 percent) 2000* 17,156,117 (10.6 percent) 14,045,745 (9.7 percent) 1996 14,233,939 (9.1 percent) 10,883,909 (8.6 percent) 1992* 12,696,547 (8.8 percent) 20,239,385 (14.1 percent) 1988* 12,165,115 (9.1 percent) 22,961,936 (17.0 percent) 1984 6,563,029 (6.6 percent) 18,009,217 (17.3 percent) 1980* 12,690,451 (11.3 percent) 18,747,825 (14.7 percent) 1976* 10,374,125 (11.5 percent) 16,052,652 (17.6 percent) 1972 6,175,199 (8.4 percent) 15,993,965 (20.8 percent) In the other three elections, more votes in the primary didn’t lead to more votes in the general. About 6 million more votes were cast for the Democratic nomination in 1980, but Republican Ronald Reagan won about 8.5 million votes in the general election. Similarly, in 1988, Democratic turnout was almost double that of GOP turnout in the primaries, but George H.W. Bush won the election with about 7 million more votes. And in 2000, about 3 million more voters turned out for the Republican primary, but George W. Bush lost the popular vote to Al Gore. (Bush won the electoral college and thus the election.)  Primary causes Though it may not be the single predictor of a general election win, enthusiasm in the nominating contests is still meaningful. Democratic turnout this election cycle may be lower because the contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders is simply not as competitive or diverse as the Republican race. Exit polls show that the vast majority of voters in the Democratic primary are satisfied with either Clinton or Sanders, pointed out Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor and turnout guru. ""On the Republican side, 50 percent or less say that,"" McDonald said, pointing out that some are casting ballots in the GOP primary to vote against a candidate as much as they're there to  vote for one. ""Voters see stark differences between the candidates, and they’re not as happy if the opposing candidate would win."" Overall though, more votes in the primaries may not mean much in what will be a highly competitive general election, according to McDonald. He pointed out that the Democrats, while not turning up at the primary polls in droves, are still highly engaged. ""Those numbers have got to be pleasing and there are good reasons why the Republicans will be able to leverage the turnout. But I don’t think it means they’re going to win,"" he said. ""I would have to agree with (Brooks) on this."" Our ruling Brooks said, ""There’s no correlation between primary turnout and wins in the fall in the last 11 elections."" There were competitive primaries on both sides in six out of the past 11 elections. In three of those six elections, the party that saw more votes in nomination contest also got more votes in the general.

Ken Paxton mischaracterizes abortion risk in Texas
","This week, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments for Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, a landmark abortion case that will decide the fate of Texas’ 2013 abortion law, known as House Bill 2. The law, among other things, requires abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and requires abortion clinics to comply with the state-set standards for ambulatory surgical centers. Before the case went in front of the Supreme Court, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton prepared to defend the law. In a Feb. 5, 2016, press release, his office highlighted that the court received ""more than 30"" amicus briefs in support of the law. ""Statistics show 2 to 3 Texas women per week have major complications and 10 women per week seek help at an ER after an abortion,"" the release said. ""Texas believes abortion facilities have no special privilege to operate outside the parameters of the medical profession and it is the right and responsibility of the state to ensure the safety of patients."" We wanted to check: Is it true that two to three Texas women have major complications from abortion per week, and that 10 women in that time seek help at an emergency room after an abortion? Attorney General’s numbers   First, we asked the attorney general’s office where it got its statistics. Deputy Press Secretary Cynthia Meyer told us via email that those statistics came from an expert for the petitioners in this case. The expert, Elizabeth Gray Raymond, is an obstetrician-gynecologist and medical researcher who currently is a senior medical associate at Gynuity Health Projects, a women’s health research organization, and an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Medicine, an appendix for the case says. Gray Raymond cited a University of California at San Francisco study, Meyer said, that found that ""the incidence of major complications following an abortion (hospital admission, abdominal surgery, hysterectomy, or blood transfusion) was 0.23 percent, and that 0.87 percent of all abortions resulted in a visit to an emergency department in which treatment was provided for an abortion-related condition."" The events that qualified as ""major complications"" were hospital admission, abdominal surgery, hysterectomy, or blood transfusion, according to Gray Raymond’s testimony. The attorney general’s office then multiplied those statistics by an estimated 60,000 abortions per year in Texas, a number taken from Department of State Health Services data. (The exact total for 2013, the most recent data available, is 63,849.) That came out to a projection of 138 major complications a year, which, divided by 52 weeks in a year, works out to 2.6 complications per week, and 522 ER visits per year, which comes out to 10 visits per week. Using the more exact 63,849 abortions per year in Texas, we get 2.8 complications and 10.7 emergency room visits per week. Numbers in context In the study that was the basis for these calculations, researchers characterized the complication rates they found as ""low."" The complication rates, a press release about the study on the university’s website said, are about the same as rates for complications following colonoscopies. That exact comparison came up during oral arguments before the Supreme court, when Justice Stephen Breyer said abortions had ""28 times less than a risk of a colonoscopy,"" and that the risks were ""roughly the same as the risks that you have in a dentist office when you have some surgery."" The rate of major complications also was similar for vasectomies, according to Gray Raymond’s testimony. Gray Raymond concluded: ""The clear message of these data is that complications of induced abortion, and particularly complications that cannot be managed at the original abortion facility, are rare."" The University of California at San Francisco study, published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, began with the goal to determine rates of complications after abortions, in part because those rates previously may have been underreported; researchers thought that complications diagnosed at a separate facility, rather than immediately following an abortion procedure, previously had been missed. Their results showed that wasn’t the case. The study concluded: ""These findings show abortion complication rates to be low and comparable to previously published rates even when there is no loss to follow-up and ED visits are included."" The study that was the basis for the Texas attorney general’s weekly and annual calculations was based in San Francisco, and all study participants had abortions paid for by California’s Medicaid program. While the study is reliable, it may not be a one-to-one comparison between low-income women in northern California and all abortions in Texas. Ushma Upadhyay, one of the study’s authors, said by phone that the rates from her study could be comparable to rates in other states. However, the abortions in the UCSF study included, at 16 percent, a higher proportion than usual of second-trimester and late-term abortions, which have a higher risk of complication. That is twice the percentage of abortions performed in the second or third trimester in Texas in 2013, the last year for which data are available from the state. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, of the 63,849 abortions recorded in the Lone Star State in 2013, 92 percent were performed in the first trimester, when the risk of complication is lower compared with the second and third trimesters. The best way to apply the study’s complication rates to Texas, Upadhyay said, would be to separate abortions by types of procedure, rather than multiply the rate by the total 60,000 abortions in Texas. Our ruling Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office said in a press release that ""statistics show 2 to 3 Texas women per week have major complications and 10 women per week seek help at an ER after an abortion."" These statistics were based on a study of abortions in California, not Texas. That study included a higher percentage of abortions performed in the second and third trimesters than occurred in Texas, making a direct extrapolation to attribute those numbers to women in the Lone Star State  problematic. Moreover, the researchers who calculated the number of abortion-related complications in the study characterized those rates as ""low."" The numbers do not lead to the conclusion that abortion providers are operating ""outside the parameters of the medical profession,"" as the attorney general’s office says. To recap, Paxton characterized Texas abortion practices and outcomes based on a California study that included twice the number of women at risk for complications as exists in the Lone Star State. He also presented the figures in a misleading way to suggest that abortion providers were operating outside of medical norms. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Paul Ryan wrong in saying there is precedent for not nominating a justice in a presidential campaign
","Ten days after the death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, House Speaker Paul Ryan entered the debate on whether Scalia’s successor should be chosen before or after Barack Obama leaves the Oval Office. The Democratic president has the right to submit a nominee before he departs in January 2017, said the Wisconsin Republican, appearing Feb. 23, 2016 on CNBC’s ""Squawk Box."" But the GOP-controlled Senate, Ryan added, has the right not to move the nomination forward and instead await a nomination from the next president. Then co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin asked: ""Should you look at whoever gets nominated on the merits of who they are, or simply on the politics of the moment?"" ""We are in the politics of the moment, which is we are in the middle of a presidential election,"" Ryan said, referring to the early 2016 primaries and caucuses. ""We’ve already had South Carolina, New Hampshire and Iowa. We’re knee-deep in a presidential election. ""There’s a reason for having this tradition of not nominating somebody in the middle of a presidential election, because it gets so political. I agree with that precedent, and there is a precedent for that."" It’s relatively rare for a Supreme Court vacancy to occur in the months leading up to a presidential election. But Ryan’s office could not provide any examples in which a president did not make a nomination during a presidential election year. We couldn’t find any, either -- though, to the contrary, we did find a number of instances in which such a nomination was made. The record Let’s note that when it comes to filling Supreme Court vacancies, presidents decide when to nominate, and the Senate decides when to consider the nomination. Often, the administration gets a read on where the Senate stands on confirming a nominee before putting someone forward. But formally, the timing for the first step is up to the president. We found five instances over roughly the past century in which there was a Supreme Court vacancy in a presidential election year and the president made a nomination. President Nominee Nomination Outcome Franklin Roosevelt (D) Frank Murphy, to replace Pierce Butler January 1940 Confirmed Herbert Hoover (R) Benjamin Cardozo, to replace Oliver Wendell Holmes February 1932 Confirmed Woodrow Wilson (D) Louis Brandeis, to replace Joseph Rucker Lamar January 1916 Confirmed Woodrow Wilson (D) John Clarke, to replace Charles Evans Hughes July 1916 Confirmed William Taft Mahlon Pitney, to replace John Marshall Harlan February 1912 Confirmed Johnson nominated Abe Fortas, who was a sitting justice, to succeed Earl Warren as chief justice, after Warren indicated he wanted to retire. Fortas hit strong opposition in the Senate Judiciary Committee and in the face of a filibuster, he asked that his name be withdrawn. (The hearings uncovered questionable speaking fees Fortas received, and he resigned from the court in 1969.) Johnson had also nominated Homer Thornberry to take Fortas’ place on the court. But that nomination, too, was withdrawn, since Fortas was never elevated. In October 1956, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower did something even more extraordinary than making a nomination less than a month before election day. He put William Brennan directly on the court with a ""recess appointment"" to replace Sherman Minton. He then formally nominated Brennan in January 1957. A February 2016 article in the Cook Political Report by University of Georgia political scientist John Anthony Maltese notes there were also presidential election-year nominations made to the Supreme Court in the 1800s. Our rating Ryan said: ""There is a precedent"" for not nominating someone to the U.S. Supreme Court ""in the middle of a presidential election.’ It’s rare for a Supreme Court vacancy to occur during a presidential election year -- the last time was in 1940, although there were also two election-year nominations in 1968. But we could find no instances in which a president faced with a Supreme Court vacancy during a presidential election year did not make a nomination. It occurred five times between 1912 and 1940, and each time the nominee was confirmed. We rate Ryan’s statement False.

Prosecutor Tim McGinty claims credit for demolishing abandoned homes
","Ohio has the gloomy distinction of being one of the hardest-hit states in the national foreclosure crisis. Its policymakers are also on the leading edge of crafting legislation to expedite foreclosures, hoping to remedy the hazards of ""zombie properties,"" or vacant homes that sit as bait for vandalism and violent crime. Ohio HB 134 reduces the foreclosure process, which can take two to three years, down to as little as six months. Currently awaiting passage in the Ohio Senate, it would make Ohio the eighth state since 2009 to pass similar legislation. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine is most clearly associated with leading the demolition of empty homes. Ohio received funding through the National Mortgage Settlement after five of the largest mortgage servicers were accused of questionable lending practices. In 2012, with Ohio’s portion of settlement funds, DeWine dedicated a $75 million grant program to reimburse counties for demolishing abandoned properties. But Cuyahoga County prosecutor Tim McGinty, running for re-election, claims that his office is responsible for hundreds of demolitions in Cleveland. On his campaign website, McGinty claims he ""tore down hundreds of abandoned homes that served as havens for crime and reduce the value of our neighborhoods."" We zoomed in on the ""hundreds"" claim. Is McGinty stealing the attorney general’s shine? We made some calls to find out.   The city of Cleveland demolished 761 abandoned and blighted properties in 2014 and 2015, according to statistics recently presented in the City Council’s budget hearings. Most of the funds for the tear-downs came from from county and federal dollars, but when demolition dollars dried up, McGinty’s office pitched in $2 million from the county’s Delinquent Tax and Assessment Collection Fund. Gus Frangos, the president of the Cuyahoga County Land Reutilization Corporation (aka the ""land bank"")  says that the prosecutor, the city and his agency teamed up to tackle the problem. The land bank used $125,000 of the prosecutor’s funds to tear down 15 properties in ""very challenged neighborhoods, which Prosecutor McGinty’s office has identified based on crime data and other distress factors,"" Frangos says. His agency tore down an additional 117 structures using its own funds from operating grants, donations and contributions. Dan Williams, city spokesperson, confirms that the city received $1.68 million from the prosecutor’s office and tore down 191 structures in 2015. Our rating McGinty says he tore down ""hundreds of abandoned homes."" It’s true that he piggybacked on the attorney general’s already-established program. But he also directed spending of $2 million from the Delinquent Tax and Assessment Collection Fund so that more demolitions could take place.

Do U.S. global AIDS dollars build stability, less violence? Hard to prove
","President Barack Obama’s final budget plan includes $4.65 billion to continue the country’s long-standing program to combat HIV/AIDS worldwide.  Launched by President George W. Bush in 2003, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, called PEPFAR, now reaches 65 countries. PEPFAR got some bipartisan love from two former Senate majority leaders, Sens. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and Bill Frist, R-Tenn. In an op-ed in The Hill titled ""Big-hearted, self-serving and right,"" Daschle and Frist argued that global health aid is in the national interest. ""In a study for the Bipartisan Policy Center last November, we showed how the largest global health project in history, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), has not only saved millions of lives but also improved America’s national security,"" they wrote. Among PEPFAR’s achievements, they said ""our study found that in PEPFAR countries, political instability and violence have fallen 40 percent (compared to just 3 percent in equivalent non-PEPFAR countries), while economic growth has increased — and so has America’s reputation."" There are many fine reasons for America to promote better health overseas, but we wanted to explore whether the data prove that reducing political instability and violence is one of them. As it turns out, it’s tough to make the case. Correlation is not causation The report Daschle cited used World Bank data to make some comparisons. It included the table below to show how 12 PEPFAR countries in Africa made more gains than 12 other African nations.  The methodology behind this comparison is murky, if only because it’s unclear precisely how certain African countries were picked to contrast with the PEPFAR ones. We duplicated the study’s selection criteria and came up with a slightly different list of nations. That could alter the results in the table above. That aside, there’s a bigger issue. It’s one thing to say that two changes overlapped (corellation) and quite another to say that one thing caused the other (causation). Along those lines, the report offered some significant caveats. It noted that ""a multitude of factors influence the quality of governance, making it impossible to assign causation.""   It also highlighted that, ""PEPFAR was successful in Sub-Saharan Africa in part because it was launched during a decades-long period of development, whereby the quality of governance had been steadily improving in the region prior to and during PEPFAR’s introduction."" In short, the report took a more cautious stance than Daschle and Frist did in their op-ed. We would note that in one place, the Bipartisan Policy Center report actually was as forceful as Daschle and Frist. In its opening summary of PEPFAR’s accomplishments, it said ""PEPFAR has also played a role in security, stability, and governance."" So the report made both strong and more circumspect statements. We asked the center staff to help reconcile what Daschle wrote and what the report contained. We did not hear back. Rachel Robinson, an associate professor at the School of International Service, at American University, said you can’t claim that PEPFAR produced those changes because Washington did not randomly pick the participating countries. ""There were countries with high HIV prevalence not included in the original 15, Malawi, for example, and some of the original 15 had relatively low prevalence, such as Nigeria and Ethiopia, but were clearly of U.S. strategic interest,"" Robinson said. ""So, looking at how things came out in PEPFAR countries vs. non-PEPFAR countries is ill-advised from a research perspective."" Equally troubling, studies during the worst years of AIDS failed to find a connection between the spread of the disease and greater instability, said Bayard Roberts, a senior lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and editor-in-chief of the Journal of Conflict and Health. ""There was a lot of rhetoric from the academic, policy, and NGO sectors on how AIDS could pose a security risk to countries in sub-Saharan Africa, but this turned out to be vastly overstated and largely false,"" Roberts said. ""The claim that reducing AIDS is linked to greater stability seems equally incorrect."" Roberts questioned the fundamental logic behind Daschle’s claim. ""From an epidemiological perspective, it is not reasonable to conclude that reducing AIDS is causally linked to greater stability and less violence,"" he said. ""There are so many other, far stronger and more plausible reasons why political instability and violence decline."" Robinson’s colleague at American University, Carl LeVan, raised another issue with Daschle and Frist’s claim. ""It conflates security and governance,"" LeVan said. ""In countries such as Uganda, the level of democracy has arguably declined while the overall levels of violence have gone down, too. I single out Uganda because it is considered one of the cases par excellence of an illiberal ruler (Yoweri Museveni) leveraging his willingness to be a leader on HIV in return for some latitude from donors on how he rules politically."" Joseph L. Dieleman, assistant professor at the University of Washington’s Department of Global Health, said he knows of no study that shows PEPFAR or another large health intervention leading to greater stability and less violence. ""This would be very hard to prove empirically,"" Dieleman said. ""This doesn’t mean it isn’t true, just that these type of data make definitive proof very difficult to ascertain."" Our ruling Daschle said that U.S. global AIDS spending helped reduce ""political instability and violence"" by ""40 percent"" in recipient nations. No one questions that the program did much to ease the burden of disease and helped many sufferers. But there are several reasons the argument that it led to political stability is difficult to make. As the report Daschle cited notes, many of the countries were on an upward path before PEPFAR began. On top of that, Washington carefully selected which nations to include in PEPFAR. Finally, experts knew of no study that shows a large scale health intervention reducing instability and violence. On the contrary, and specific to HIV/AIDS, no study has found that the disease causes instability. Daschle’s statement treats correlation as if it were causation.

Ted Cruz says Donald Trump wrote 10 checks to Hillary Clinton campaigns
","During the Republican presidential debate in Detroit, Ted Cruz went after Donald Trump by bringing up the real estate developer’s past donations to the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton. Cruz said, ""Donald Trump has written checks to Hillary Clinton not once, not twice, not three times. Ten times. And four of those checks were not to her Senate campaign. It wasn't that she was the New York senator and it was a cost of doing business. It was to her presidential campaign."" We found that Cruz has a point that Trump has given multiple donations to Clinton, including to her presidential campaign. However, Cruz’s count is too high, and with the presidential donations, there is less than meets the eye. (We aren’t looking at Trump’s donations to the Clinton Foundation.) We looked up donations by Trump both in the Federal Election Commission donor lookup and a similar tool offered by the Center for Responsive Politics, a group that tracks campaign contributions. Cruz’s number -- 10 donations -- matches the number of donations that come up when searching the FEC site for donations by ""Donald Trump."" However, searching that way lumps in donations made by Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr. Weeding out the son’s donations requires clicking into the scanned images of his donation disclosure forms. Here’s a summary of the elder Trump’s donations to Clinton: Date Amount Senate or presidential 05/01/2002 $1,000 Senate 03/23/2005 $1,000 Senate 09/30/2005 $900 Senate 12/02/2005 $1,000 Senate 11/01/2006 $200 Senate 11/12/2007 $600 Presidential 11/09/2009 $1,700 Presidential 11/10/2009 -$2,300 (refund) Presidential This data supports Cruz’s general point that Trump has made multiple donations to Clinton over the years. But Cruz is off on the specifics in several ways. First, the number of total donations isn’t 10, as Cruz said, but seven. The number of donations to her presidential campaign wasn’t four, as Cruz said, but two. Second, the total amount of Trump donations to Clinton’s presidential campaign were refunded in November 2009. Who requested this refund -- Trump or Clinton -- was not recorded in the documentation. Third, the timing of both Trump’s biggest presidential donation and the refund is also curious. The money was not spent and refunded during the heat of the 2008 presidential primary campaign, when Clinton was running. Rather, the transactions came a full year after Barack Obama -- Clinton’s primary rival -- had already been elected president. If we can learn any more about the circumstances of these donations and refunds, we will update this article. Members of Trump’s immediate family also gave money to Clinton over the years. His wife, Melania, gave one donation of $2,000 to Clinton’s Senate campaign in 2006. His daughter, Ivanka, gave three donations totaling $4,400 to Clinton’s Senate campaign in 2006 and 2007. And Donald Trump Jr. gave three donations worth $6,100 in 2006 and 2007, minus a refund of $1,700 in 2008. On net, the younger Trump gave $2,100 in donations to Clinton’s Senate campaign and $2,300 to her presidential campaign. Indeed, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told PolitiFact that ""between Trump and his children, it is 10 times. It is all Donald Trump's money."" However, we don't consider this money to be Trump's -- his wife and the children who donated are adults -- and Cruz didn't refer to Trump's family at large. Our ruling Cruz said Donald Trump has written 10 checks to Hillary Clinton ""and four of those checks were not to her Senate campaign. … It was to her presidential campaign."" He has a point that Trump has made multiple campaign donations to Clinton, but he overstated the amounts. Trump ended up making five donations worth $4,100 to Clinton’s Senate campaign, and two donations worth $2,300 to her presidential campaign. The presidential donations were eventually refunded in their entirety. We rate Cruz’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2016/mar/04/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-donald-trump-wrote-10-checks-hillary/

Donald Trump resurrects debunked claim that wives of 9/11 hijackers fled the U.S. days before attack
","When the subject turned to terrorism during the March 3 Republican presidential debate in Detroit, Donald Trump called for being tough on the families of terrorists, not just the terrorists themselves. As an example, he resurrected a claim he has made before — that the wives of the 9/11 terrorists knew what was going to happen and fled the United States to Saudi Arabia just before the attacks. ""A man flies in the World Trade Center and his family gets sent back to where they were going —  and I think most of you know where they went and, by the way, it wasn't Iraq. But they went back to a certain territory. They knew what was happening. The wife knew exactly what was happening,"" Trump said. ""They left two days early with respect to the World Trade Center and they went back to where they went and they watched their husband on television flying into the World Trade Center, flying into the Pentagon and probably trying to fly into the White House except we had some very, very brave souls on that third plane."" During part of the response it sounds like Trump is talking about one wife, but he subsequently makes it clear that he's talking about all of the planes involved in the attack — actually there were four. So in the same breath he seems to be talking about multiple wives. Trump was clearer during the December 15 GOP debate in Las Vegas when he said that friends, family, girlfriends ""were put into planes and they were sent back, for the most part, to Saudi Arabia. They knew what was going on. They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television."" Regardless, Trump’s account of what happened in September 2001 doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Of all the hijackers, not one had a wife, girlfriend or family member in the United States during the days or months leading up to the hijackings, according to the 9/11 Commission report. Not all were pinpointed, but ""they sure weren’t living in the United States,"" Philip D. Zelikow, executive director of the 9/11 Commission, told PolitiFact in mid-December. In fact, only two of the 19 hijackers were married and only one had a girlfriend, and she was living in Germany. The commission concluded that most of the 19 hijackers had ""broken off regular contact with their families"" long before the attacks, except for the hijacker with the girlfriend in Germany. He was on the plane that crashed in rural Pennsylvania. Investigators concluded after extensive interviews that she knew nothing about the plot. Trump’s words might reflect some confusion with the hastily organized departures of members of Osama bin Laden’s extended family -- not any wives or girlfriends of bin Laden himself -- a few days after the attack. Most of the bin Laden relatives were in high school or college in the United States. In an interview with the New York Times, Saudi Ambassador Bandar bin Sultan said that with the help of the FBI, his government arranged for these people to assemble in Washington where a chartered plane would take them back to Saudi Arabia. But it seems clear Trump wasn't talking about them. And the fact that some of those relatives were evacuated from the United States for their protection doesn't make what Trump said during the Fox debate any more accurate. Trump's claim is False. 
The wives of the 9/11 hijackers ""knew exactly what was happening"" and went back to Saudi Arabia two days before the attacks to watch their husbands on television flying the planes.

Donald Trump is right: Marco Rubio has worst Senate voting record
","In a heated exchange, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump criticized rival Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida for his Senate voting record. ""This guy has the No. 1 absentee record in the United States (Senate), he doesn't show up to vote,"" Trump said at the March 3 Fox News debate in Detroit. Trump has trotted out this claim about Rubio multiple times, and we’ve found it to be Mostly True. Let’s revisit the facts. The ""most truant"" award goes to Rubio if we’re looking at the past year. If we examine career records among the remaining presidential candidates who have served in the Senate, he’s tied with Republican rival Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.   Votes missed this past year From March 2015 through March 2016, Rubio has missed 77 of 263 roll call votes, according to GovTrack. Here’s how Rubio stacks up against the other senator-candidates right now: Senator Votes missed (March 5, 2015 to March 3, 2016 Absentee rate Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) 125 41 percent Ted Cruz (R-Texas) 108 36 percent Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) 58 19 percent Rubio’s absentee rate of 41 percent puts him at the 100th percentile, which means that in the past year, he has had a worse voting record than every other sitting senator. In contrast, the Senate median absentee record for the past year is just 1 percent. The majority of the votes Rubio’s skipped came after April 13, when he announced his candidacy, the Tampa Bay Times noted. ""It's not unusual for presidential candidates to miss Senate votes,"" Rubio spokeswoman Brooke Sammon told the Tampa Bay Times. ""Sen. Rubio remains fully engaged in the issues important to Florida and helping Floridians, and as he travels the country to talk about his agenda to help the middle class, there will be no doubt where he stands on any important issues before the Senate."" Overall attendance Cruz and Rubio, as of March 3, both have a career absentee rate of 14.8 percent. Senator Votes missed (career) Absentee rate Cruz 152 out of 1,026 14.8 percent Rubio 224 out of 1,512 14.8 percent Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y., 2001-2009) 249 out of 2,616 9.5 percent Sanders 131 out of 2,865 4.6 percent But beyond the current field, neither Cruz or Rubio are the worst-ever offenders, according to a May 2015 Washington Post analysis. For example, President Barack Obama missed 24.2 percent of votes in his brief Senate career. And that doesn’t even compare to the most truant senator of all time: Maryon Allen, D-Ala., who racked up a 43.5 percent absentee rate during her five-month stint in the Senate in 1978. Our ruling Trump said Rubio has ""the No. 1 absentee record in the United States"" Senate. He’s accurate if we look at the number of votes missed this past year. In that time frame, Rubio has missed a higher percentage of votes than any other senator, including those running against him. If we look at career truancy records among the remaining presidential contenders, Rubio and Cruz are tied at 14.8 percent absentee rates. Some former senators have had worse records, including Obama.

"['National', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'John Kasich']","
John Kasich correct that he polls best among GOP hopefuls against Hillary Clinton
","Early in the Republican presidential debate in Detroit, the candidates mixed it up over polling data. First, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said that ""of all the people on this stage, (Donald Trump) performs the worst against Hillary Clinton"" in head-to-head matchups for the general election. Ohio Gov. John Kasich later added that he’s the candidate best positioned to take on Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. ""I beat Hillary Clinton by more than anybody, by 11 points,"" Kasich said. He was referring to the four Republicans on the debate stage -- himself, Rubio, Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Was Kasich correct? We turned to the polling averages at RealClearPolitics.com, a popular aggregator of comprehensive polling data. We’ll start by noting that polling experts typically urge caution when comparing head-to-head matchups for the general election this early in the campaign cycle. That said, we looked at the polling results a couple of different ways. One was the RealClearPolitics poll average, which averages the most recent polls. The other was the range of results since Feb. 1. Here’s a table summarizing the results:   Democratic nominee, RCP average Republican nominee, RCP average Head-to-head leader and margin Strongest poll for Republican since Feb. 1 Weakest poll for Republican since Feb. 1 Hillary Clinton 40.3 percent John Kasich 47.7 percent Kasich +7.4 Kasich +11 Kasich +3 Hillary Clinton 43.5 percent Marco Rubio 48.5 percent Rubio +5.0 Rubio +7 Rubio +2 Hillary Clinton 45.0 percent Ted Cruz 46.5 percent Cruz +1.5 Cruz +3 Clinton +2 Hillary Clinton 45.4 percent Donald Trump 42.0 percent Clinton +3.4 Trump +2 Clinton +8 What does this tell us? First, it confirms Kasich’s assertion that he beats Clinton ""by more than anybody"" still in the race. The average of recent polls shows that Kasich’s edge over Clinton is 7.4 points, which is larger than the leads over Clinton being posted by Rubio, Cruz or Trump. (In fact, on average, Trump actually loses to Clinton by 3.4 points.) The one element of Kasich’s statement that isn’t entirely supported by the data is that he beats Clinton by 11 points. It’s true that in his strongest recent poll, Kasich defeated Clinton by 11 points -- it was a USA Today-Suffolk poll taken between Feb. 11 and Feb. 15. But emphasizing that one poll is a bit of cherry picking. It also tells us that Rubio was correct that Trump does the worst against Clinton, as he loses to her by an average 3.4 percentage points in recent polls. Our ruling Kasich said that in head-to-head polls for the general election, ""I beat Hillary Clinton by more than anybody, by 11 points."" The RealClearPolitics average of recent polls shows Kasich faring better against Clinton than Rubio, Cruz or Trump. But focusing on the 11-point margin in his best poll is a bit of cherry picking. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/mar/04/john-kasich/john-kasich-correct-he-polls-best-against-among-go/
"['Gambling', 'Florida', 'Charles Van Zant']","
Gamblers lose $6 for every $1 Florida gets, Rep. Van Zant says
","While the Senate signaled its gambling bills were all but dead this year, they’ve stayed on life support in the House. But one lawmaker wanted his fellow representatives to remember gaming revenues come at a high price. Rep. Charles Van Zant, R-Keystone Heights, said lawmakers should remember that all gaming revenue is money someone has lost. ""Every time you lose a dollar at gaming, there's six more dollars that are lost,"" Van Zant said during a Feb. 29, 2016, meeting of the House Finance and Tax Committee. ""For every time the state gets paid a dollar in taxes, somebody loses $6, is another way of saying that."" Van Zant was speaking against HB 7109, a wide-ranging gaming bill that in part allowed for the ratification of the contentious gaming compact the Seminole Tribe of Florida negotiated with Gov. Rick Scott in 2015. The bill also included all sorts of provisions for pari-mutuels, licenses and permits, care of racing greyhounds, and more. While the measure passed and was reported favorably to the House, the Senate postponed its own gambling bills March 1. Barring some extraordinary procedural move, the Senate measure is likely tabled for the rest of the session, which ends March 11. That means the new compact likely won’t be ratified. Van Zant opposes gambling in general, so his point of view is that any gambling revenue, whether for the state or a casino or track, is all money taken from people who have placed a bet of some form. We’re not going to focus on his moral objections, but we were curious whether people lose six times what the state gets in taxes from gaming. It turns out that it depends on what kind of gambling you’re talking about. Gambling revenues Van Zant was not specific in the hearing about what form of gambling he meant, but his office referred us to a 2005 report in the National Tax Journal about state and local government taxes on casinos nationwide. ""The American Gaming Association (2004) reports that 443 commercial casinos in 11 states generated more than $27 billion in gross gaming revenue in 2003,"" the report read. ""State and local governments derived $4.32 billion in direct gaming taxes from this economic activity, or about 16 percent of gross gaming revenue."" That 16 percent rounds to $1 of state revenue for every $6 gamblers spend, Van Zant’s office said. Those numbers are more than a decade old, so we looked up a more current snapshot. The American Gaming Association in 2014 said casino gaming revenues (from gambling, not hotel rooms or drinks or some such) were $67 billion, and casinos paid out $10 billion in state and local taxes. So more recently, the nationwide figure rounds up to almost 7 to 1. But applying that logic to Florida’s gambling environment is difficult, at best. It would have helped if Van Zant had been more specific, because Florida has several forms of gambling. There are cardrooms, where people play poker and other games; pari-mutuels, which are essentially horse and dog racing; slot machines; lotteries; and Indian-owned casinos. The state gets a cut of all these forms of gambling, but the percentage varies depending on the game. For example, cardrooms are taxed at 10 percent. The slot machine tax rate, meanwhile, is 35 percent. There are various fees and permits and other charges involved, too. ""I think the national statistic stands on its own merit, but it is problematic to apply it to Florida’s specific tax and revenue-sharing structure related to legal gambling,"" state economist Amy Baker from the Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research told us. ""The gaming taxes are all on different bases and aren’t designed to be functionally equivalent."" She added the state hadn’t done a comprehensive revenue analysis across all forms of gambling combined, but it wouldn’t be a fast or simple calculation. To even try to make a direct comparison to Van Zant’s stat, we could look at only casino revenue. Seven of Florida’s eight casinos — which share revenue with the state — are owned by the Seminole Tribe. The state’s cut of casino revenue is spelled out in the Tribe’s compact, a business agreement that sovereign Indian tribes must enter into with their home states in order to run casinos on their land. (This is the agreement the Tribe wants the Legislature to renew with some new provisions.) The state is technically not allowed to tax the Tribe, because that’s against federal law. But the compact allows the state to agree with the Tribe to get money via ""revenue sharing."" Under terms of the compact that expired last year, the Seminoles agreed to share gaming revenues with the state based on tiers: The Tribe would pay 12 percent of net revenue up to $2 billion, 15 percent of revenue between $2 billion and $3 billion, and so on. Some of that revenue was guaranteed, while the rest depends on how well the casinos did in a given year. Calculating net revenue can get pretty complicated, but the shorthand version is that the state said the effective cut those casinos gave the state was 12.24 percent in 2015. That ratio comes out to about 8 to 1 — in effect, people gamble away $8 for every $1 the state gets, using Van Zant’s reasoning. That’s more than the 6 to 1 ratio he cited, but again, that’s just casino dollars. As we’ve noted, other forms of gambling bring in more taxes per dollar, some less. We also should point out that the vast majority of this money is what economists refer to as ""cannibalized."" That is, it’s money coming from people already in the state who gamble instead of spending that money elsewhere. Our ruling Van Zant said, ""For every time the state gets paid a dollar in taxes, somebody loses $6."" His argument is that the taxes states receive from gaming revenue is money other people have lost while gambling. Van Zant was using nationwide figures from 2005 for the amount of tax money state and local governments received from casinos. That ratio changed to about 7 to 1 by 2014. But that comparison is tough to apply to Florida. The state has more forms of gambling than just casinos, and the state gets money from all of them in different ways and at different rates. If we look at just the terms of how the Seminole Tribe shares its casino revenue, the state gets about $1 for every $8 people spend in casinos. Van Zant’s larger point stands that state tax revenue comes at the expense of comparatively high gambling losses, but the details are fuzzy at best. We rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2016/mar/04/charles-van-zant/gamblers-lose-6-every-1-florida-gets-rep-van-zant-/
"['Arizona', 'Immigration', 'Ted Cruz']","
Has Arizona’s economy improved because of its immigration laws?
","Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has talked tough on immigration, saying he would deport all 12 million undocumented immigrants. CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Cruz what is wrong with letting the ""good ones"" come back to the United States during the Feb. 25 GOP debate in Houston. Cruz referenced a Feb. 9 Wall Street Journal article and said Arizona’s strict immigration laws have prompted undocumented immigrants to flee the state. As a result, it has become tougher for business owners in the state to find skilled workers, but at the same time state spending decreased. ""Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration, and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state. ... Some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up, and from their perspective that was a bad thing. But what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they're spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars,"" Cruz said. ""And, the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop, are seeing wages rise. That's who we need to be fighting for."" Arizona is no stranger to controversy with some of its immigration laws. But has the departure of undocumented immigrants after legislation helped Arizona’s economy to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars? We decided to fact-check Cruz’s complex immigration claim. But first, some background on Arizona immigration policy. Why did immigrants leave?  Arizona’s undocumented immigrant population was on the climb prior to 2007, according to a Pew Research Center study. The population peaked in 2007 with about 500,000 undocumented immigrants in-state. But from 2007 to 2012, the undocumented immigrant population dropped 40 percent. However, immigrants across the state were already leaving because of the December 2007 recession. Arizona’s housing market crashed and construction jobs, one of the state’s major sectors, dried up. Immigrants ""have left long before the passage of these anti-immigration laws,"" said Lisa Magaña, an associate professor in the School of Transborder Studies at Arizona State University. Arizona passed Proposition 200 in 2004, which requires citizenship to receive social services such as childcare and housing assistance. The state passed Proposition 300 two years later, which bars in-state tuition for college students without a lawful immigration status. But the meat of Arizona’s policies toward undocumented immigrants did not start until 2008. Arizona required employers to use the federal E-Verify system in 2008, which requires an employee to have a Social Security number to legally work. Finally, then-Gov. Jan Brewer signed SB 1070 into law in April 2010. The measure allowed law enforcement officers with ""reasonable suspicion"" to ask for a person’s immigration papers when engaging in a stop. Most of the law was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court, but last September a U.S. District Court Judge upheld the law’s provision that allows police to question the immigration status of those they suspect are undocumented. Welfare Welfare has ""never gone"" to undocumented immigrants, Liz Schott, a senior fellow and welfare expert at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said. However, some children of undocumented immigrants are eligible for benefits if they were born in the United States and are citizens. Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors reduced immigration, noted that these U.S.-born children could share their cash welfare benefits with their undocumented parents. In 2008, Arizona spent more than $121 million in cash welfare. In 2014, they spent more than $32 million on cash welfare. According to Schott, Arizona just spends more in other welfare areas, such as child-care assistance for those working and/or attending school. ""They’re spending it all, they’re just spending it elsewhere,"" Schott said. Because it is difficult to determine how many undocumented immigrants receive cash welfare, it’s hard to credit this drop to people leaving the state. Prisons As for state prisons, Arizona’s Department of Corrections tracks noncitizens, either documented or undocumented, with a felony conviction. From fiscal year 2010, which ran from July 2009 to June 2010, to fiscal year 2015, the state’s noncitizen prison population has declined almost 23 percent, but that’s just about 1,400 inmates. The daily cost of keeping a noncitizen in a state prison hasn’t changed much, either. In fiscal year 2010, it cost $59.85 per day to house a noncitizen. In fiscal year 2015, it cost $61.55. Because of the dip in noncitizen inmates, that’s a savings of almost $28 million. However, overall state spending on prisons has increased almost 17 percent between 2008 and 2015. Elliott Pollack, CEO of his own Scottsdale-based economic consulting firm, said Cruz’s rationale bothers him. ""The cause and effect might be there to some extent, but I just don’t see how it saves hundreds of millions of dollars,"" Pollack said. ""There’s no evidence of that."" Meanwhile, Camarota said the departure of undocumented immigrants ""makes things a little better."" ""Could he (Cruz) be right? He could be,"" Camarota said. However, Cruz’s points are subject to error. Camarota also notes that undocumented immigrants ""paid something"" in taxes. A February 2016 report from the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates that Arizona’s undocumented immigrants pay more than $231 million a year in state and local taxes. Education  On education, the state also does not track spending on undocumented immigrants in schools. The Wall Street Journal article Cruz described uses the state’s decline in intensive English student enrollment -- about 80,000 students between 2008 and 2012 -- as a potential cost-saving measure, noting that it could save the state about $350 million per year. But it’s not that simple. ""I think it’s a combination of factors,"" Arizona Department of Education spokesman Charles Tack said, noting that the decline could be attributed to students leaving the system or being reclassified elsewhere. Plus, that measure correlates intensive English with undocumented immigrants, which isn’t tracked to begin with. We reached out to the Cruz campaign for comment but did not hear back. Our ruling Cruz said, ""spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars"" because of Arizona’s exodus of undocumented immigrants. That’s far from clear. While it’s technically possible to receive cash welfare through U.S.-born children, undocumented immigrants do not receive cash welfare directly. And, the state’s prison and education budgets do not solely account for those without papers. Even then, any potential savings would be hard to calculate. It is not an apples to oranges comparison. The recession played a significant role in Arizona’s immigrant population decline, too. There’s been no noticeable windfall in the state budget for welfare, education and prisons that we could document. We rate Cruz’s claim as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/mar/04/ted-cruz/has-arizonas-economy-improved-because-its-immigrat/

Donald Trump falls for phony Gandhi quote: 'First they ignore you, then they laugh at you ... '
","It's a message designed to inspire perseverance in the face of long odds, and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump invoked it on Instagram, accompanied by a photograph of a Feb. 28 rally in Alabama in advance of Super Tuesday. ""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win,"" says the quote, which Trump attributes to Mahatma Gandhi, India's legendary activist who eschewed all violence. The quote is certainly legendary. A quick Google image search of the phrase ""then they laugh at you"" produced a flood of memes crediting Gandhi. We stopped count at 100. We found it on Bernie Sanders' Twitter feed. Sarah Palin posted it on Facebook Feb. 24 in front of a photo of Trump. Our colleagues at Snopes.com found an instance where Hillary Clinton used it during a 2004 fundraiser. And last year, Billionaire Magazine cited it in a Tweet to celebrate enormous wealth, without a hint of irony. Inspiring? Yes. Accurate? No. We reached out to the Trump campaign in hopes that they had an original source for the quote. They didn't respond. But there's no evidence that Gandhi ever said it. ""I know of no source by Gandhi where this quotation occurs,"" said Dennis Dalton, professor emeritus at Columbia University's Barnard College, who has spent 55 years researching and writing on Gandhi's life.   It's been thought to be false for quite some time, prompting the Christian Science Monitor to list it five years ago as one of ""The 10 most famous things never actually said,"" although the Monitor reported no effort to find its origin. Some authors have suspected it's derived from a May 15, 1918, speech during a biennial convention of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America in which Nicholas Klein of Cincinnati, talking about that union, said, ""First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And they they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you. And this is what is going to happen to the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America."" Barry Popik, a contributor to the Yale Book of Quotations and the Oxford English Dictionary, found a more recent variant in a 1968 article in Women's Wear Daily. Referring to French artist, writer, designer and filmmaker Jean Cocteau, the article says, ""Cocteau expressed it best. ‘First, they ignore you. Then, they abuse you. Then, they heap you with honors. Or make you into a statue. Stone. Dead.’ "" Popik said the first reference he has found giving Gandhi credit for that type of quote comes from an out-of-print book — the 1982 proceedings of an event held by the Workshop in Nonviolence Institute. Snippets can be seen on Google Books. On page 9 of volume 18 are the words, ""Gandhi once observed that every movement goes through four stages: First they ignore you; then they abuse you; then they crack down on you and then you win."" Note that the catchphrase itself is not in quotes. It appears the author was paraphrasing. ""We have 1918 (in labor unions) and 1982 (in an antiwar group), and just about nothing in between. It's a real puzzle,"" said Popik. Dalton, the Gandhi historian, said a lot of quotes attributed to the nonviolent activist aren't real. ""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind,"" is a variant of a phrase written for the 1982 Richard Attenborough movie Gandhi. The catchphrase ""You must be the change you want to see in the world,"" was also never spoken by him, he said. ""The point is that a study of his life and work do tell us that he could have spoken or written such words, because they capture the spirit of what he did,"" said Dalton. ""That's perhaps the best answer that I can give."" In the end, it's comparable to people thinking that Sarah Palin said, ""I can see Russia from my house"" (Tina Fey said it while impersonating Palin on Saturday Night Live), that Humphrey Bogart uttered the phrase, ""Play it again, Sam,"" in Casablanca, or that Sherlock Holmes said ""Elementary, my dear Watson,"" during any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories. A lot of people believe it, even though it's not true. Our ruling Trump quoted Mahatma Gandhi as saying, ""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."" There's no evidence that Gandhi ever said any such thing. Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and many others have made the same mistake.

Is Joe Heck is the only Senate candidate to not weigh in on Supreme Court vacancy?
","Reluctance by Senate Republicans to confirm President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court pick after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia is giving Democrats across the country plenty of political ammunition. It’s also playing out in Nevada, where the state Democratic Party is repeatedly slamming Republican Senate candidate and U.S. Rep Joe Heck over his measured, non-committal position on filling the vacancy. Party operatives have unleashed at least five press releases and countless tweets and emails attacking Heck over his stated preference that ""each entity should exercise its prerogative."" But one attack stuck out as particularly noteworthy — the claim that ""every"" Republican Senate candidate other than Heck has announced a position on taking up the vacancy. Here’s what party spokeswoman Sarah Zukowski said: ""Every Republican Senate candidate has now taken a position on the issue of whether the Senate should go a whole year without doing its job, but all we get from Congressman Heck are non-answers and Washington-speak,"" she said in a press release on Feb. 23. It’s quite a claim to say that literally every Republican senatorial candidate has taken a position on any issue, much less the politically-charged Supreme Court vacancy, so we decided to look into it. Journalists at the New York Times and liberal websites Think Progress and Daily Kos have tried to chart out where individual Senate Republicans stand on the issue of approving a nominee either now or under the next president. But those lists are mostly focused on the positions of sitting senators, and don’t include Senate hopefuls like Heck. So we put together a more complete list of what candidates and incumbent senators up for re-election in 2016 have said about the court vacancy using candidates listed in political scientist Larry Sabato’s ""Crystal Ball."" We found several who haven’t addressed the issue at all. In Maryland, for example, at least 14 candidates have filed as Republicans to run for the open Senate seat currently held by Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski. Only a handful of the candidates have functioning websites, and we could only find two candidates  — Mark McNicholas and Chrysovalantis Kefalas  — who even addressed the vacancy issue. It’s a similar case in Colorado, with 12 Republicans vying to take on incumbent Sen. Michael Bennet. Candidates there are all over the map, including some like state Sen. Tim Neville who have taken a similarly neutral or otherwise vague position. ""As far as the schedule is concerned, the U.S. Senate is going to have the final say on who gets approved,"" he said to the Aurora Sentinel. ""So whether it happens now or after the next election, the Republican Senate majority needs to stand strong and only confirm a nominee that will stand firm in defense of the Constitution."" Duf Sundheim, a California Republican running a long-shot Senate bid, issued a similarly vague statement. ""Whether they approve or reject a nominee is a decision that should be made by each senator,"" he said. ""But they should do so with the highest level of veracity and honor."" In total, we found at least 15 candidates who issued vague statements not specifically spelling out what they believe the Senate should do regarding the court vacancy, and many more who didn’t announce any position on their website or social media accounts. It’s fair to point out that many of the listed candidates are, to put it generously, running grassroots campaigns with little money and little hope of ending up in office. Zukowski issued a backtracking statement to PolitiFact saying, ""All serious GOP Senate candidates have made it clear where they stand on the GOP's refusal to do its job."" But the party is wrong in saying that the entire field of Republican Senate candidates have announced a clear stance on the issue, and in declaring that Heck stands alone in taking a guarded position on the vacancy. Our ruling The Nevada Democratic Party says that ""every Republican Senate candidate"" has announced their position on the Supreme Court vacancy, except for Heck. Our research shows that’s not the case. There are more than a dozen candidates, at least, who issued similarly neutral statements, and even more who haven’t addressed the issue at all.

Is it legitimate?    Kenney’s communications director, Lauren Hitt, said Kenney got the statistic from the Economy League, which used a study from ReadyNation/America’s Edge, an organization with a goal of strengthening business ""through better policies for children and youth."" Cohen specifically mentioned the same study in his editorial. The study examines the total dollar effect of $1 in pre-K spending on the state’s output. Using a tool called the IMPLAN model, it theorizes that the money spent on pre-kindergarten would lead to new learning centers and new teachers and staff. Those new learning centers would spend locally on supplies and other resources for the pre-K programs, and the teachers would spend the money on food, clothes, restaurants and whatever else they’d need. The businesses would in turn hire more people to meet the increased demand. The estimated economic effect would be an additional 79 cents generated in the economy per dollar spent on pre-k for a total of $1.79. Tim Bartik, author of ""Investing in Kids: Early Childhood Programs and Local Economic Development"" said the study’s estimate of an additional 79 cents generated per dollar of spending is probably high because it doesn’t take possible tax increases into account, which is the way many early childhood education programs are financed. Kenney hopes to fund the annual $60 million to fund pre-K through a soda tax. Bartik said the likely effect of $1 on pre-K spending, given a tax increase, would be the dollar spent for pre-K and perhaps a little extra. ""I could imagine it being greater than a dollar,"" said Bartik, who is also a senior economist for the Upjohn Institute and has received a research grant from ReadyNation. ""How much greater I couldn’t say. It would be a lot of work to get the right answer.""   He said the estimated impact of an extra 79 cents for every dollar spent was not likely unless the pre-kindergarten program was privately financed. Steve Doster, the Pennsylvania director for ReadyNation/America’s Edge, confirmed the study did not take into account how each $1 spent on pre-K would be raised, such as through an increase of taxes.   ""When this report was generated it was generated looking at significant public investment from Pennsylvania,"" Doster said. This doesn’t mean expanded pre-K couldn’t have major benefits. In fact, Bartik said the total economic impact from $1 of pre-K spending could be as much as $3 to $5. But that estimate would include benefits from freeing the time of parents of pre-kindergarten students who could work more hours or gain more skills, the possibility of increased earnings of pre-kindergarten students years down the line and the spillover effects from both of those scenarios. The study being referenced by Kenney and Cohen -- and that would be of most interest to the business community -- is about the short run, the total dollar impact of one dollar spent on pre-kindergarten on the state output.    Ron Haskins said there hasn’t been much other research to back the estimates laid out in the ReadyNation/America’s Edge study but reaffirmed what Bartik and several other studies have pointed out in terms of overall economic benefits. No matter what kind of positive economic effect is being predicted, the total would depend on the unknown: the quality of the program. For pre-kindergarten to pay off for businesses or children, it must provide a good education across the board.   ""I want to emphasize,"" Haskins said. ""Without quality, forget the 79 cents."" Our ruling Mayor Jim Kenney cited a study saying every dollar spent on pre-k education in Pennsylvania would yield $1.79 for the state economy. Comcast’s David L. Cohen noted the same study in an editorial.   While studies and experts agree the economic impact of quality pre-kindergarten programs could be substantial, the study pointed out by Kenney is about shorter-term effects on the state’s output. Taxes required to pay for the pre-K program could lessen the economic effect, adding up to less than an extra 79 cents per dollar spent.   But research and expert opinion illustrate quality pre-K likely will have a substantial, positive effect on the local economy.   We rule the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2016/mar/03/jim-kenney/would-each-dollar-pre-k-spending-generate-179-loca/

Donald Trump's absurd claim that he knows nothing about former KKK leader David Duke
","A few days before Donald Trump dominated Super Tuesday, the Republican frontrunner was being rebuked left and right for declining to denounce former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. The controversy began Feb. 24, when Duke said that he supports Trump’s candidacy and told listeners of his radio program to ""get active"" for Trump. Two days later, Trump disavowed Duke in a news conference. But Trump, who claims to have the ""world’s greatest memory,"" seemed to have forgotten this by Feb. 28. When CNN’s Jake Tapper asked him about Duke, Trump claimed ignorance four times: ""Well, just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke. okay? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don't know. ""I don't know, did he endorse me or what's going on, because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. And so you're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about. … ""I don't know any -- honestly, I don't know David Duke. I don't believe I have ever met him. I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him. And I just don't know anything about him."" Later that day, Trump tweeted a video of his earlier disavowal of Duke, and blamed his failure to do it again on CNN on ""a very bad earpiece."" As fellow fact-checkers at the Washington Post and Factcheck.org have pointed out, Trump knew enough about Duke to denounce him several times over the past two decades. Duke mentions this election Trump, as we previously noted and as he acknowledged himself, renounced Duke just two days before he told Tapper he knew nothing about the white nationalist. When a reporter asked about Duke’s support on Feb. 26 (without identifying Duke as a former Klansman), Trump said, ""I didn’t even know he endorsed me. David Duke endorsed me? Okay, all right, I disavow, okay?""   And a few months ago, in August 2015, Trump ""repudiated"" an earlier expression of support from Duke in a Bloomberg interview:   John Heilemann: ""We’ve heard this week that David Duke — former Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan — has come out and said he’s in support of your candidacy. So my first question is why do people like that like Donald Trump? And second, how do you feel about the David Duke quasi-endorsement?"" Trump: ""I don’t know the answer to the first. Who knows why? But I don’t need his endorsement. I certainly wouldn’t want his endorsement. I don’t need anybody’s endorsement. I’m not looking for…""   Heilemann: ""Would you repudiate David Duke?"" Trump: ""Sure, I would do that if it made you feel better. I would certainly repudiate. I don’t know anything about him. Somebody told me yesterday, whoever he is, he did endorse me. And actually I don’t think it was an endorsement. He said I was absolutely the best of all the candidates. But I wouldn’t want him …"" 2000 Trump: Duke is ‘a big racist’ Fifteen years ago, when Trump was flirting with a White House bid as a Reform Party candidate, he named Duke as a cause of concern at least three times. In 2000, former wrestler and then-Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura broke with the Reform Party because he didn’t want to be associated with the Reform Party’s presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, whom Duke supported. ""Buchanan is an anti-abortion extremist and an unrealistic isolationist,"" Ventura told the New York Daily News on Feb. 12, 2000. ""The latest I hear is that he's now getting support from David Duke. I can't be a part of that and I won't be part of that."" Before he called it quits, Ventura said he consulted with Trump. After Ventura left the party, Trump also named Duke as one of the Reform's ""biggest problems"" on NBC’s Today Show. ""Well, you've got David Duke just joined — a big racist, a problem. I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party,"" Trump said on Feb. 14, 2000.   He announced that day that he wouldn’t seek the nomination of the Reform Party, naming Duke as one of his reasons. ""Now I understand that David Duke has decided to join the Reform Party to support the candidacy of Pat Buchanan,"" Trump wrote in a statement. ""So the Reform Party now includes a Klansman,  Mr. Duke, a Neo-Nazi, Mr. Buchanan, and a Communist, Ms. Fulani. This is not company I wish to keep."" A few days later, Trump himself quit the party and repeated his earlier statement. ""Although I am totally comfortable with the people in the New York Independence Party, I leave the Reform Party to David Duke, Pat Buchanan and Lenora Fulani. That is not company I wish to keep,"" Trump wrote in a Feb. 19, 2000, New York Times op-ed. 1991 Trump: A vote for Duke is ‘an anger vote’ Even earlier, Trump appeared on CNN on Nov. 19, 1991, and discussed Duke’s defeat in the Louisiana governor’s race and his possibly running against then-President George H.W. Bush. (Duke declared his candidacy as a Republican about a month after Trump’s interview.) Larry King: ""Did the David Duke thing bother you? Fifty-five percent of the whites in Louisiana voted for him. Four hundred New Yorkers contributed."" Trump: ""I hate seeing what it represents, but I guess it just shows there's a lot of hostility in this country. There's a tremendous amount of hostility in the United States."" King: ""Anger?"" Trump: ""It's anger. I mean, that's an anger vote. People are angry about what's happened. People are angry about the jobs. If you look at Louisiana, they're really in deep trouble. When you talk about the East Coast — it's not the East Coast. It's the East Coast, the middle coast, the West Coast."" King: ""If he runs and Pat Buchanan runs, might you see a really divided vote?"" Trump: ""Well, I think if they run, or even if David Duke — I mean, George (H.W.) Bush was very, very strong against David Duke. I think if he had it to do again, he might not have gotten involved in that campaign because I think David Duke now, if he runs, takes away almost exclusively Bush votes and then a guy like (Mario) Cuomo runs. I think Cuomo can win the election."" King: ""But Bush morally had to come out against him."" Trump: ""I think Bush had to come out against him. I think Bush — if David Duke runs, David Duke is going to get a lot of votes. Whether that be good or bad, David Duke is going to get a lot of votes."" Our ruling Trump said, ""I don't know anything about David Duke."" Trump seems to have forgotten that he knew enough about Duke to denounce him twice this election cycle. In 2000, he knew enough to criticize Duke’s racism. And in 1991, he knew enough to say he hated what votes for Duke represented. We rate Trump’s claim Pants on Fire!
