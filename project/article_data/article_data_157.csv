Trump mislabels Obamacare subsidy as gift to insurers
","The current sword hanging over the Obamacare health insurance markets is the future of one of the subsidies in the system. It’s called cost-sharing reduction and it cushions lower-income people from out-of-pocket costs when they see a doctor. This makes up a small slice of the total insurance picture, but President Donald Trump brought the matter to a head Oct. 12 when he canceled all payments. They are worth an estimated $10 billion next year and the move sent a jolt through the individual and small business market. Premium hikes of 20 percent were suddenly a real possibility for policy holders. Trump touted his decision at a cabinet meeting on Monday. ""I knocked out the CSRs (cost-sharing reductions),"" Trump said Oct. 16. ""That was a subsidy to the insurance companies. That was a gift that was, frankly, what they gave the insurance companies."" The very next day, two key Republican and Democratic senators announced a deal to keep the payments flowing. At first, Trump seemed at ease with the compromise. ""It is a short-term solution so that we don’t have this very dangerous little period -- including a dangerous period for insurance companies by the way,"" Trump said Oct. 17. ""For a period of one to two years, we will have a very good solution."" Then, about eight hours later, at a Heritage Foundation dinner, Trump raised doubts about where he stands. He praised the bipartisan effort, but then returned to his theme about insurance companies. ""I continue to believe Congress must find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies,"" Trump said. Amidst these head-snapping shifts, we asked, are those cost-sharing reduction payments a bailout, a ""gift"" to the insurance companies? We couldn’t find an economist who thought they are. In fact, while Washington would be sending insurers those checks, Trump’s statement missed the point that the money doesn’t end up in the companies’ pockets. Here’s why. This piece of Obamacare was designed to protect lower-income families from hefty out-of-pocket costs. The policies they bought on the Obamacare exchanges came with deductibles and co-pays, but instead of paying those themselves, the insurance companies do. Who gets the money? The doctors, hospitals and labs that provide the services. At the end of the day, the federal payment covers the insurer for footing the bill. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidelines for insurers spells this out pretty clearly. It defines cost-sharing reductions ""as expenses on behalf of an enrollee for essential health benefits, including deductibles, copays, and coinsurance."" The actual process of figuring out how much to pay each insurance company has a few bumps and turns. Washington pays companies an estimated amount up front, and then trues-up the books every quarter. Companies ""must report the amount they paid for each eligible medical claim, the amount enrollees paid for the claims, and the amount of cost sharing that would have been paid for the same services under the corresponding standard plan,"" the guidelines say. Martin Gaynor at Carnegie Mellon University said in no way does this amount to a subsidy for insurance companies. ""It’s not like we were just handing them a pile of money for an expense they didn't incur,"" Gaynor said. ""It’s supposed to keep things neutral. You paid this out on behalf of the enrollee, and now here’s money from Uncle Sam that’s intended to keep you whole."" We asked economist Jeffrey Clemens at the University of California San Diego, and finance professor Scott Harrington at the Wharton School. They both agreed -- the cost-sharing reduction is no gift because if you look at the full picture, the insurance companies are no better off at the end then they were at the start. The only wrinkle that Harrington saw was legal. Due to a court ruling, Trump had the right to cancel the payments. So long as he didn’t do that, that was good news for the insurers. But all that said, the cost-sharing reductions make insurance more affordable to people at or near the poverty line and that increases the number of policies insurance companies can sell. The value of the cost sharing is about one sixth the size of the premium tax credits, which do the heavy lifting to keep insurance affordable, but still, the impact is there. We asked the White House about this and did not hear back. Trump called the cost-sharing reductions payments a gift to insurance companies. In reality, the money pays the insurers for payments they make to health care providers. It is a pass-through. Every health care economist we reached said if the companies don’t gain any cash from the transaction, then there is no gift, no bailout or whatever term one might use. The one grain of truth is that anything that makes insurance more affordable increases sales, even if by a small amount. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973A7880>],/factchecks/2017/oct/18/donald-trump/trump-mislabels-obamacare-subsidy-gift-insurers/

Jobs have grown under GOP Gov. Scott Walker, but Democrat Tony Evers says growth fell 70% in 2016
","In a video posted Oct. 4, 2017 in his run for governor, Tony Evers repeatedly cites Gov. Scott Walker’s failed 250,000 jobs promise -- then hits him with a new attack. Midway into the video, an unidentified TV anchor says this in introducing a news story: ""Job creation in the state fell by an astounding 70 percent last year to the lowest level since Gov. Scott Walker took office."" After another reference to Walker’s jobs promise, from his first campaign for governor in 2010, the video replays the audio of the anchor’s words and then these words appear on the screen: ""Job creation fell by 70% in Wisconsin in 2016."" To be clear, the number of private-sector jobs in Wisconsin has increased each year Walker has been in office. But Evers refers to the most recent annual figure that measures how fast jobs are growing. Let’s see if he’s correct. The promise and the race Walker promised to create 250,000 private-sector jobs by the end of his first term. Our Walk-O-Meter, which tracks the Republican’s campaign promises, rated that pledge Promise Broken. The tally had reached only 130,000 by January 2015. We also rated rated as True a claim that as of June 2017, Walker still was short, as the job total had reached about 180,000 at that point in his tenure. Nevertheless, Walker survived a recall election in 2012, won re-election in 2014 and -- though he has pushed off a formal announcement of his intentions -- is widely expected to seek a third term. Meanwhile, Evers, the state school superintendent since 2009, is among a half-dozen Democrats with active campaigns who hope to win the August 2018 primary and compete in the November 2018 general election. Evers’ evidence To back Evers’ claim, his campaign provided us video of the full TV news story, which was aired in May 2017 on WKOW in Madison. The story said the increase in private-sector jobs in Wisconsin in 2016 was 70 percent lower than the increase in 2015, and that the figure was based on data given to the station by Walker’s administration. The original source of the data was the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. We asked Walker’s campaign organization for a response and were referred to Wisconsin Republican Party spokesman Alec Zimmerman. He cited a June 2017 opinion article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel by a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, which called Wisconsin’s job growth over six years ""extraordinarily strong,"" and told us: For someone to talk about Wisconsin’s job growth while leaving out the fact that the state is exceeding what most economists consider to be full employment, not only ignores a critical factors but gives a very skewed impression of Wisconsin’s economy ….We aren't talking about job losses. This is about slower gains, and gains that are slower because we are at or near full employment, a good thing. Quarterly figures The federal quarterly figures are considered the gold standard for job counts. Although the claim we’re checking focuses on the change in 2016, the Evers video also alludes to Walker’s entire tenure. So, for perspective, we’ll show the annual figures for private-sector job growth for each year since Walker took office in January 2011 (percentages are rounded). Year Annual increase in private- sector jobs in Wisconsin Percentage change in private-sector job growth vs the previous year 2010 33,658 --- 2011 29,800 -11% 2012 33,872 +14% 2013 29,723 -12% 2014 36,758 +24% 2015 38,077 +4% 2016 12,937 -66% So, for 2011 through 2015, the number of private-sector jobs rose by roughly 30,000 to 38,000 per year. But in 2016, the increase was 66 percent lower than the increase in 2015 -- nearly the 70 percent figure Evers claimed. While Evers doesn’t directly blame Walker, his video is an attack that clearly holds Walker at least partly responsible. We’ve reported in many fact checks that according to economists, a governor plays an important, but limited, role in a state’s economy, given that many factors are at play. As for what happened in 2016, Milwaukee-area economist Brian Jacobsen told us that nationwide, the growth in private-sector jobs was 29 percent lower than the growth in 2015. He said manufacturing-heavy states such as Wisconsin lagged more, but that the pace of job growth in Wisconsin has picked up in 2017. Andrew Reschovsky, a professor emeritus of applied economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us Evers’ statement is technically accurate. But he said it could be stated in a more ""transparent"" way, such as: ""The rate of private-sector job creation in Wisconsin was 66 percent lower in 2016 than in 2015"" under Walker. Our rating Evers says: ""Job creation fell by 70 percent in Wisconsin in 2016"" under Walker. He’s essentially on target in that the one-year growth in private-sector jobs in 2016 was 66 percent lower than the growth in 2015 (13,000 jobs versus 38,000 jobs) -- though it’s important to note that private-sector jobs have increased each year during Walker’s tenure, but much more slowly in 2016. Where clarification is needed is that Walker’s performance is only one of many factors affecting job growth. We rate Evers’ statement Mostly True. div class='artembed'>",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1F2C80>],/factchecks/2017/oct/18/tony-evers/jobs-have-grown-under-gop-gov-scott-walker-democra/

School voucher claim in Ga. gov. race leaves out important details
","As public school advocates, Georgia Democratic gubernatorial frontrunners Stacey Abrams and Stacey Evans have both taken a firm stance against privatized public education and especially school vouchers. But at a recent forum featuring the two candidates, Abrams accused Evans of voting for vouchers when she was a state representative. ""You voted for vouchers. You didn’t vote for it the last two times, but you voted for it in the beginning,"" Abrams said on Oct. 2. Abrams later said she was referring to Evans’ involvement with a bill about the Georgia Student Scholarship Organization. The program began in 2008, three years before Evans held a seat in Georgia’s General Assembly. Back then, the Student Scholarship Organization bill established a program that allows independent individuals and businesses to receive tax credits if they make donations to local private schools. The money is then used to fund scholarships that are given to qualified, low-income students to attend the private institutions. Abrams claims that Evans had voted in favor of school vouchers a few years later, when the Legislature made revisions to the program. Evans did vote for an early version of the 2011 bill, but not for the final version. According to her campaign, she only voted for the measure because it had provisions that improved the program’s transparency. When the final bill hit the House floor with its final revisions, the transparency clauses were removed, so Evans voted against the bill. Evans has also maintained that she has never voted for vouchers because the Student Scholarship Organization is not a voucher program. On June 26, 2017, the Georgia Supreme Court ruled that stated that the scholarship program is not a voucher program, because it is financed by private individuals, not public revenue, a fact that Abrams had acknowledged during the debate. Despite the Supreme Court ruling, the Student Scholarship Organization’s status as a voucher program is still subject to debate. Before the forum, the Evans campaign had already been defending her stance against vouchers, and on Oct. 12 the Abrams campaign shared its opinion on Facebook that the funds in the program are ""vouchers by another name."" Our ruling Abrams said Evans ""voted for (school) vouchers...in the beginning."" Abrams said she was referring to the Student Scholarship Organization program. Some aspects of Abrams’ statement are wrong. Evans wasn’t in the legislature in 2008 when program was approved. In 2011, Evans voted for revisions to the program, although she voted against the final version after those revisions were dropped. Over the years, there’s been a legal dispute over whether the tax credits that fund the Student Scholarship Organization make the program different from school vouchers. In June 2017 Georgia’s Supreme Court ruled that the ""voucher"" label did not apply. Abrams' claim had some accurate points, but it left out important details.

"['National', 'State Budget', 'Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs']","
Is Oklahoma spending more than ever? Only if you ignore inflation
","As Oklahoma’s elected officials wrestle to close a budget gap, a recent op-ed from the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs argued that tax hikes shouldn’t be part of the solution. ""Why do we need to raise taxes if the government is already spending more than ever before,"" the conservative think tank wrote. ""State government spending is at an all-time high. The state is on track to spend more in this fiscal year — more than $17.9 billion — than at any time in state history."" Where does the state money go? Well, schools, both K-12 and higher education, account for one of the heftiest lines in the budget. Another big ticket item is SoonerCare, the state’s Medicaid program. It all adds up. We wondered if it’s truly the case that the state is spending more money than ever before. The answer depends on whether you think inflation matters. Most economists, bankers and corporate CFOs do, and when you factor in that a dollar today is worth less than a dollar in the past, the council’s claim falls short. The council got its spending numbers through 2016 from the state’s Office of Management and Enterprise Services. The state hasn’t closed out the books for 2017, but preliminarily, expenditures hit about $17.9 billion. (Technically, we’re now in FY 2018.) Based solely on the raw dollars, that part of the council’s statement is on the mark. Here’s how the official totals look in the years for which we have final numbers: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Current dollars (billions) 12.85 14.14 15.02 16.08 16.62 16.65 16.71 17.04 17.52 17.40 17.96 But the numbers change when you take inflation into account. We used a very common yardstick -- constant 2009 dollars based on the changes in the national Consumer Price Index. Viewed that way, spending today amounts to about $15.83 billion in 2009 dollars. It was clearly higher at the height of the recession in 2009 ($16.08 billion) and 2010 ($16.35 billion), and a smidge more in 2011. This chart shows the constant (in red) and nominal or current dollars (in blue) side-by-side. Spokesman David Autry at the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs said the inflation adjustment had the biggest impact on the results, but he discounted its importance. ""Working Oklahomans (taxpayers) aren’t allowed the luxury of adjusting for inflation when the mortgage or rent comes due,"" Autry said. ""The taxpayers who foot the bill for state government are forced every day to live within their means."" Adjusting for inflation does have a place in the council’s toolkit. Autry said that the council adjusts for inflation when it looks at numbers over a longer period of time, because ""because readers may not have that kind of knowledge."" He also noted that the results shift depending on the choice of an inflation measure, and sent us three alternatives.  But even using his options, spending in 2010 topped 2016 for the two that looked at what consumers pay. Only by limiting the measure to what producers pay (the producer price index) did 2016 come out the highest. Autry sent this table: We can round out the spending burden picture by looking at spending compared to the state’s population and its economy. When there are fewer people, the burden falls on fewer shoulders. If the economy is smaller, even the same amount of spending would require a bigger economic effort. The state gained about 330,000 people between 2006 and 2016. Its economy grew by about $33 billion in real terms in the same period, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Based on population, constant dollar spending was higher in seven of the past 11 years. Measured against the size of the state’s economy, it was higher in eight out of the past 11 years. 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Per capita constant dollars 3790 4021 4080 4324 4346 4183 4070 4043 4050 3985 4034 Spending as percent of GDP 9.6% 10.1% 10.2% 11.2% 11.4% 10.5% 9.7% 9.3% 9.0% 8.7% 9.0% The Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs said that spending this year is on track to be the highest ever. While the raw numbers show that, the statement ignores the impact of inflation, a standard practice when comparing dollars over time. Factoring in inflation shows that real spending was higher in 2009 to 2011. When population and economic growth are added in, spending has been higher over most of the past decade. The statement contains an element of truth but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['Taxes', 'Missouri', 'Roy Blunt']","
Tax code is so long that nobody's really sure of its length
","The tax code has been a big topic since President Donald Trump visited Missouri in August. Trump called for tax cuts and policies that he said would grow the economy. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., continues to voice these ideas to Missourians. Blunt said that Missourians need a tax code that is simple and fair. ""Our tax code has nearly doubled since 1985,"" Blunt said in a tweet on Sept. 8, linking to an opinion piece with the same line from the Kansas City Star. Has tax code really doubled in 32 years? We decided to see if Blunt is right. We reached out to Blunt’s office and were pointed to an article from the Tax Foundation. ""In 1955, the Internal Revenue Code stood at 409,000 words. Since then, it has grown to a total of 2.4 million words: almost six times as long as it was in 1955 and almost twice as long as in 1985,"" the website said. The Tax Foundation defines itself as an independent, nonprofit think tank. The Internal Revenue Code is a list of regulations that govern how taxes are submitted and collected. However, the Tax Foundation also points out that tax code isn’t the only thing that Americans must deal with to complete their taxes. It talks about the 7.7 million words of tax regulations from the IRS and the 60,000 pages of case law that is tax related. These are not law, but are also important pieces of understanding taxes. We wanted to dig a little deeper still. If you download the Internal Revenue Code from the United States Code, also known as Title 26 in the document, the file is 6,550 pages long. Not all of that is the text of the code itself, but that is still rather lengthy. Blunt definitely got it right that the code is long, but has it doubled since 1985? ""Since it was last reformed in 1986, there have been thousands of additions and changes to the Tax Code over the last 30 years,"" said Caroline Bruckner, the Managing Director of the Kogod Tax Policy Center at American University. A report from the Taxpayer Advocate Service to Congress in 2008 about the complexity of the tax code, outlined how the word count of tax code has grown from 1.395 million words in 2001 to 3.7 million words when the report was done. That’s a 265 percent growth in word count in seven years. ""The Code has grown so long that it has become challenging even to figure out how long it is,"" the report said. The report from the Taxpayer Advocate Service stated the length of the code has more than tripled since 1975. A similar report published in 2012 by the Taxpayer Advocate Service noted 4 million words at the time of the report. That is a 286 percent growth in word count from the 2001 figure. Why does it grow, though? Bruckner pointed to the continuous changes that are passed by Congress to raise revenue and address problems as well as the IRS publishing changes to tax rules yearly to factor in inflation. ""Our tax laws are not static; and, in fact, when they are, they tend to create more problems than not for taxpayers. That’s one reason why Congress adjusts the Tax Code so often,"" she said. Why are politicians so fascinated with the size of a document? ""Outdated tax policies are stifling our economy and taking money out of the pockets of hardworking Missourians,"" Blunt said in the article for the Kansas City Star. Some view the volume of the tax code as the problem, but others think it is the complexity of the code and the process of collecting taxes. Bruckner believes there are ways to streamline the taxation process. ""The majority of adults in the U.S. now have a smartphone — who cares how long the tax code is if you could just pay your taxes using an app that tracks your expenses, deductions and credits for you? The challenge is how do we do that without compromising taxpayer privacy and security concerns,"" she said. The report from the IRS and the Taxpayer Advocate Service also discuss the amount of hours it takes Americans to complete their taxes and how much money it costs to hire people to assist. Blunt said the tax code has nearly doubled since 1985. Government and independent reports suggest the number of words used in the tax grown has grown even more than that.

Rex Tillerson overstates Donald Trump's effect on increased NATO defense spending
","President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized allies for not meeting NATO defense spending targets, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said it’s already made a difference. ""The president early on called on NATO member countries to step up their contributions — step up their commitment to NATO, modernize their own forces,"" Tillerson said on CNN’s State of the Union on Oct. 15. ""He’s been very clear, and as a result of that countries have stepped up contributions toward their own defense."" We wondered if NATO countries have stepped up defense contributions and whether the step was a result of pressure from Trump. We found that 25 NATO allies plan to increase spending in real terms in 2017, according to official NATO statistics released in June. But there are many factors at play that have contributed to the increase — not just Trump’s urging. There are 29 members of NATO, formally the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which was created in 1949 to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. NATO leaders reached a collective agreement in 2014 that directed members to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense spending by 2024. As of June 2017, only five counties met that obligation: the United States, Greece, Estonia, Poland and the United Kingdom. (In 2017, the United States has spent about 3.6 percent of its GDP on defense.) However, the latest data from NATO shows that 25 countries plan to step up spending in 2017. NATO expects Romania to meet the 2 percent threshold this year, and Latvia and Lithuania to reach it by 2018. It's also worth noting that all NATO members have been asked to submit national plans on increasing defense spending by the end of this year.  Other countries since 2014 have been contributing more to their defense, even if they are not at the 2 percent mark. At a June 29 press conference, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that 2017 marks the third consecutive year of increasing defense investment across European allies and Canada, adding that there has been ""an increase of almost $46 billion U.S. dollars more for defense since 2015."" The ""Trump administration's rhetoric on defense spending has put pressure on NATO allies to continue the upward trajectory,"" said Jeffrey Rathke, a senior fellow and deputy director of the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Experts said the trend really started in earnest after the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin after 2014. Specifically, the Russian invasion of Crimea and Russian-backed fighting in eastern Ukraine galvanized countries to focus on their territorial defense capabilities at this time. At the Wales Summit Declaration in 2014, members of NATO pledged to increase their defense spending to 2 percent of their gross domestic products by 2024. So some of the increase in defense spending was decided before Trump took office. Stephen M. Saideman, an international relations professor at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs, pointed to the situation in Canada as an example. He said Canada’s defense policy review was mostly completed before the 2016 American election.   ""They might have changed some of the numbers, but the biggest driver of the big increase in future spending (not in 2017 but down the road) has been the commitment to build 15 frigates/destroyers despite increased costs —and that is mostly due to political competition for votes in Halifax/Vancouver, not Trump pressure,"" he said. Since becoming president, there’s no doubt Trump has done several things to persuade NATO leaders to get their defense commitments up to the alliance's standard. But Trump was not the first president to call for a step up in defense spending. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama called for increased spending by countries on defense. The difference is Trump has made the issue a major point at almost all NATO-related discussions. Christopher A. Preble, the vice president for Defense and Foreign Policy Studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, said it’s possible countries have stepped up spending to protect themselves from the possibility that the president might not fulfill obligations made under the NATO treaty. In the past, Trump has questioned defending other countries from attack if they don't spend what he considers to be their fair share.

Tillerson said that NATO countries are contributing more to their defense as a result of pressure from Trump. According to NATO, over the last 3 years, European allies and Canada spent almost $46 billion more on defense, meaning increases in spending have occurred before Trump’s presidency.

Runner-up for Raleigh mayor says he got support from 'all over'
","Charles Francis stood outside his law firm in downtown Raleigh on Wednesday and gave several reasons he might have a shot at beating Mayor Nancy McFarlane in a runoff. A majority of voters supported someone besides McFarlane, Francis noted. That’s true; if you add up the 19,232 votes for Francis, a Democrat, with those of Republican candidate Paul Fitts, it equals more than McFarlane’s 25,414. (The race is nonpartisan but candidates and political parties often align themselves with each other.) Francis said he got ""broad support in some inside-the-Beltline precincts and some northwestern precincts."" He said he ran ""neck and neck"" with McFarlane in Brier Creek and that he ""had support all over Raleigh."" Since McFarlane didn’t get 50 percent of the vote (she got 48 percent), Francis can call for a runoff and has until Oct. 19 to make the decision. It’s no surprise that Francis, the Democratic candidate in a city dominated by registered Democrats, got votes in every precinct. But his claim that he got ""support all over Raleigh"" implies that he was competitive across the city. Let’s look at his level of support and where he got it. A map showing precincts across Raleigh appears to show a city that’s almost evenly divided between McFarlane supporters in the west and Francis supporters in the east. Francis, who is black, campaigned on the idea that McFarlane and the City Council haven’t done enough to help Southeast Raleigh, which is predominantly black. Preliminary election results suggest racial, economic and geographic differences between McFarlane voters and Francis voters. Northwest Raleigh Francis said he had ""broad support from some northwestern precincts."" The lone precinct he won west of Falls of Neuse Road had 11 total votes. Francis got seven of them. Otherwise, McFarlane carried every northwestern Raleigh precinct. In the area east of Glenwood Avenue, north of Interstate 440 and west of Atlantic Avenue and Litchford Road, McFarlane won 22 precincts by more than 100 votes. There were five northwestern precincts where McFarlane and Francis were separated by fewer than 50 votes. Francis said his ""neck and neck"" comment referred to the precinct encompassing the Brier Creek area, where McFarlane got 235 votes and he got 210. Votes in the other four precincts broke down this way: 31-13, 99-65, 127-78 and 57-30. Overall in those five close precincts, McFarlane garnered a total of 549 votes and Francis got 396. Southeast Raleigh There’s no concrete definition of the area that defines ""southeast Raleigh"" but it’s generally considered to be the area south of New Bern Avenue and east of Wilmington Street. By that definition, Francis won most precincts handily. He won all but five precincts by more than 100 votes. In some of those, he won more than 85 percent of the vote. Two precincts straddle Wilmington Street and McFarlane won both of those. But, unlike other southeast Raleigh precincts, the majority of voters in those precincts are white. Francis won one precinct by only 23 votes, but it was in a district where only 63 votes were cast. Inside the Beltline This is where Francis suffered his biggest losses. Interstate 440 and, in some places, Interstate 40 combine to make a loop around downtown Raleigh known as the Beltline. The Beltline encompasses the state Capitol, county seat – meaning it’s home to many government offices – and several universities, as well as the city’s richest and poorest residents. A PolitiFact analysis found that McFarlane carried 26 of the 33 precincts that are inside the Beltline or that straddle it, drawing 8,521 total votes to Francis’ 5,066. Francis defeated McFarlane by more than 100 votes in four precincts and by 98 votes in another – but they were all in southeast Raleigh. He drew 366 votes and beat McFarlane in precinct 01-28, which is more east than southeast, but only by seven votes. In another precinct that overlays part of Gorman Street and Western Boulevard southwest of downtown, Francis only lost 158 to 142. But elsewhere inside the Beltline, McFarlane trounced him. There were 19 ITB precincts where McFarlane had more than twice as many votes as Francis and 10 precincts where she had three times as many votes as him. She easily won most precincts west of Atlantic Avenue, south of Interstate 540 and north of Glenwood Avenue. More data coming The election results on the N.C. State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement website are preliminary. The vote counts haven’t been finalized. More than 9,000 residents voted early: giving McFarlane 4,297 votes and 4,018 for Francis. And, as the Francis campaign pointed out, the board has yet to sort those votes into the precincts where the voters reside. There are 108 precincts, but only six early voting sites. Another 400 residents voted by mail. So it’s possible that candidate performances in specific precincts results fluctuate in a week or so. Until then, the public has only the preliminary results to inform them about candidate performances. Our ruling Francis said he got support ""all over Raleigh."" He also said he got ""broad support in some inside-the-Beltline precincts and some northwestern precincts"" and that he got ""overwhelming support in Southeast Raleigh."" Francis was right about his performance in Southeast Raleigh but wasn't exactly competitive in northwest Raleigh and inside the beltline. That large swath of Raleigh stretching from Hillsborough Street to Millbrook Road – where he didn’t come close to competing with McFarlane – is too big and too dense of an area to suggest that he was competitive ""all over Raleigh.""

Colin Jost, on Weekend Update, says a Texas law bars ownership of more than 6 dildos
","Saying individual Americans should own fewer guns, a co-host of the news-like Weekend Update segment on NBC’s ""Saturday Night Live"" wrapped in a claim about Texas. Colin Jost, who also wondered aloud about the mass shooter in Las Vegas owning 47 guns, said in the Oct. 7, 2017 episode: ""No one should own 47 of anything."" Cats, for instance, Jost went on, before adding: ""There is a real law in Texas that says it’s illegal to own more than six dildos. And I get why—no one needs that many! If you have more than six dildos, it’s a clear sign you are training for something awful."" Cue laughter. But does Texas have such a law? An NBC spokeswoman, Lauren Roseman, declined to comment when we sought the basis of Jost’s statement. We similarly failed to draw comment--about Jost's accuracy--from the Texas attorney general’s office, law professors and representatives of Texas law officers and district attorneys. A law found unconstitutional For our part, we suspected that Jost was referring to a state law restricting ""obscene devices"" that remains in place despite being found unconstitutional by a federal appeals court nearly a decade ago. We recently looked into the law, which dates to the 1970s, in finding Mostly False a claim that U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the former Texas solicitor general, once supported a ban on sex toys. Cruz’s defense of the law, we concluded, came as part of his duties as the state’s top appellate lawyer at the time. Section 43.23 of the Texas penal code does not specify dildos. It states: ""A person commits an offense if, knowing its content and character, he wholesale promotes or possesses with intent to wholesale promote any obscene material or obscene device."" Another provision specifies: ""A person who possesses six or more obscene devices or identical or similar obscene articles is presumed to possess them with intent to promote the same,"" the implication being that the person would violate the restriction on promoting such devices. In ruling against the state in February 2008, judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals cited Lawrence and Garner v. Texas, the U.S. Supreme Court's 2003 opinion striking down bans on consensual sex between gay couples, in violation of the 14th Amendment. State lawyers did not appeal the dildo ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. ""Just as in Lawrence,"" the circuit court judges wrote, ""the state here wants to use its laws to enforce a public moral code by restricting private intimate conduct. The case is not about public sex. It is not about controlling commerce in sex. It is about controlling what people do in the privacy of their own homes because the state is morally opposed to a certain type of consensual private intimate conduct. This is an insufficient justification after Lawrence."" Law remains in place Lawyers familiar with the appeals court ruling agreed, when we asked, that the sexual devices statute remains in Texas law — but that’s an empty reality, most said. James C. Todd, a since-retired Texas assistant attorney general who defended the law in federal district court, said by phone he wasn’t surprised that legislators haven’t acted to repeal the law. His speculation: ""They don’t want to go back and in the next election have it said (that) my opponent voted against a law to prohibit indecency."" Todd said that while the law remains on the books, it’s unenforceable; since it’s declared unconstitutional, no prosecutor would prosecute someone for violating it, he said. Gary Krupkin, a Dallas lawyer who represents vendors of sex toys, said by email that the circuit court’s ruling had the same effect as the Texas Legislature repealing the law. Krupkin said he’s unaware of any other state law that could be used to ban, restrict, or otherwise impede the purchase, ownership, commercial sale or use of multiple dildos. Former judge suggests legal limbo We should otherwise note a legal twist explored by PolitiFact Florida in 2015. In 2008, a Texas state appeals judge upheld a conviction stemming from the sale of a vibrator by a store in Corpus Christi. The majority opinion upholding the Texas law was issued months after the federal circuit court had found it unconstitutional. In 2015, legal experts commented on this contrast by saying that technically, federal rulings are not directly binding on state courts, but plaintiffs still would be assured of relief if they pursued their case in federal court. In the July 2008 state appeals court ruling, Linda Reyna Yañez, a judge on the 13th District Court of Appeals covering Brownsville north to Wharton, wrote that though the court embraced the circuit court’s ruling against the law’s constitutionality, it wasn’t required to follow it. Yañez wrote: ""Fifth Circuit precedent is not binding on Texas courts."" The judge also wrote that because the state’s chief criminal appeals court earlier held that the same law didn’t violate due-process rights, the state appeals court had no binding basis to hold otherwise. In 1985, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had held that the statute did not violate an individual's right to privacy, concluding that there was no constitutional right to ""stimulate another's genitals with an object designed or marketed as useful primarily for that purpose."" At our request, Yañez, an Edinburg attorney who’s no longer a member of the appeals court, re-read the ruling in October 2017. Next, she told us by phone that she stands by the conclusion despite her personal backing of the circuit court’s ruling. ""I remember,"" she said, ""not being able to do what I really wanted to do,"" which would have been to find the law at fault, she said. But because the U.S. Supreme Court hadn’t taken up the law’s constitutionality while the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had previously upheld it, she said, ""I had absolutely no choice."" ""Theoretically a law enforcement officer could still arrest somebody"" for violating the law, Yañez said. ""This is the way it works. Sometimes you have these inconsistencies and people are left in limbo."" Todd later agreed by phone that it’s a rule of judicial decision-making that Texas appeals courts follow the highest state court’s ruling even on a matter of federal constitutionality. Then again, Todd said, ""I’ve always felt like they’re not going to ignore what the 5th Circuit says."" Krupkin said by email that we’d have to check every Texas county to cement whether anyone has been prosecuted under the law. ""However, there is a very small cadre of attorneys that specialize in dildo defense. As part of that group, I have not heard of any prosecutions,"" Krupkin said. Our ruling Jost said: ""There is a real law in Texas that says it’s illegal to own more than six dildos."" Such a cap on ""obscene devices"" has been state law since the 1970s though it’s worth clarifying that the law mostly hasn’t been enforced since federal appeals judges found it unconstitutional in 2008.

Ad opposing Ohio Issue 2 wrongly portrays proponent as health care CEO
","A TV advertisement opposing Ohio’s Issue 2 ballot initiative to lower drug costs portrayed the initiative as a ploy by the health care industry to hike up costs. ""Over the next few months, you’re going to hear a lot about the November ballot issue on prescription drugs,"" the May 23, 2017, video says. ""A California health care CEO is promising to reduce our prescription drug costs. It sounds too good to be true, because it is."" They went on to list a number of associations opposing the ballot initiative because they ""believe it could increase drug costs for millions of Ohioans."" If approved on Nov. 7, Issue 2 would require all drugs bought by the state -- whether for Medicaid or other state programs -- to match Veterans Affairs prices, which receive a 24 percent discount off market price in addition to sometimes undisclosed rebates. The idea is that it would lower the state’s health care costs. Whether or not the ballot initiative can achieve its goal -- or the opposite -- is contested, as we wrote about in another fact-check. For this check, we wanted to know if the person behind the initiative was indeed a health care CEO. His title is complicated, but the ad’s message is misleading. Notably, the video failed to mention that the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade association representing drugmakers, was behind the opposition campaign. The ad attacks Michael Weinstein, the president and co-founder of the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the biggest AIDS-fighting organization in the world. And he’s behind both this ballot initiative and a similar one in California. ""Both the New York Times and the LA Times have referred to Mr. Weinstein as the CEO of his organization — AHF — which is clearly a health care organization,"" Dale Butland, a spokesman for the opposition campaign, told us. ""Indeed, the New York Times Magazine profile of Mr. Weinstein was titled 'The CEO of HIV.' "" Christopher Glazek, the author of the New York Times Magazine story, said the title of the piece was intended as ""arch."" ""It's a nonprofit, and his official title isn't CEO,"" Glazek said. The organization derives its revenues from a network of pharmacies and clinics that provide care to mostly government-insured patients. The excess income goes to provide free care to more than 773,000 H.I.V. patients worldwide. Weinstein’s annual report showed a salary of $400,000, which Glazek characterized as ""low for directors of similarly sized nonprofits."" Christine Mai-Duc, who co-wrote the Los Angeles Times article, said, ""He is referred to as the ‘chief executive’ in a photo caption in our story, not in the story itself."" However, she noted that a follow-up story referred to him as the foundation’s ""top executive."" The group that favors the initiative said the description of Glazek is just wrong, and it’s politically motivated. ""I think calling him a health care CEO would be disingenuous if it were banal, but considering they are in the process of character assassination, then it is wrong that drug company CEOs are spending money from excessive profits to try to label him as one of them,"" said Dennis Willard, a spokesman for Ohio Taxpayers for Lower Drug Prices. The drug lobby PhRMA has so far outspent the AIDS Foundation roughly 5 to 1, according to the Columbus Dispatch. An ad against Ohio’s Issue 2 ballot initiative said, ""A California health care CEO is promising to reduce our prescription drug costs."" Weinstein is the president and co-founder of AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a nonprofit funding Issue 2, but the articles cited by the campaign referred to Weinstein as a CEO either in jest or in a photo caption. His organization deals with health care and he is indeed its top executive, but the ad makes it seem as though he represents the drug industry, which is actually true of the ad makers. It’s the national association for pharmaceutical companies that opposes the ballot measure.

Ohio Issue 2 ballot initiative proponents overstate impact on EpiPen prices
","Ohio Taxpayers for Lower Drug Prices claims its ballot initiative could lower the price tag for the EpiPen, a popular auto-injector for serious allergic reactions. ""We’ve gone from paying about $100 for EpiPens to over $600. And they only hold about one dollar’s worth of medicine,"" the Aug. 29, 2017, video says. ""We don’t have a choice but to pay it and the drug companies know it. Vote yes on Issue 2, the Drug Price Relief Act."" Do EpiPens really cost that much, and could their price go down with an up-vote on the ballot initiative? Prescription drugs may be severely overpriced, but the ad misrepresents the bill’s impact. And strangely, its example of EpiPens doesn’t really apply to the population that the group is trying to help. Issue 2 is a ballot initiative up for a vote on Nov. 7. If approved, it would require all drugs bought by the state -- whether for Medicaid or other state programs -- to match Veterans Affairs prices, which receive a 24 percent discount off market price in addition to sometimes undisclosed rebates. The idea is that it would lower the state’s health care costs. The ad has a point that the price for the EpiPen two-pack soared since 2007, from $94 to $609. Each pen holds about one dollar’s worth of the drug epinephrine. While the ad makes it sound as though there is no alternative, Mylan released a $300 generic EpiPen two-pack in December 2016 and Lineage Therapeutics offers a generic auto-injector for $110. That’s still a lot, but it’s less than the $600 the ad mentions. The ad also misrepresents the population the initiative would aid, as approximately 70 percent of EpiPen users are privately insured, and Medicaid patients already pay nothing out of pocket, according to Brittany Warner, an Ohio Medicaid spokeswoman. And even if the ad was referring to the prices paid by the state, instead of patients, Medicaid already enjoys significant discounts. Brand EpiPen 2-pak’s listed price for the Medicaid program is $291.41, but because it doesn’t include rebates (which remain confidential), it may be lower. The VA price is indeed lower: $182.33, which includes rebates. ""They’re trying to appeal to the sense of outrage of high drug prices, especially for things that ought to be covered for free, but it’s a weird example to cite in the context of this particular initiative, as the vast majority of people who use it are privately insured,"" said Kao-Ping Chua, a health policy researcher at the University of Chicago who co-authored a study of out-of-pocket spending on EpiPens. Chua said the privately insured and the uninsured bore the greatest brunt of the price increase, though the price they faced for the injectors varied depending on the type of plan they are on. According to Julie Knell, a spokeswoman for Mylan, the company that sells EpiPens, ""nearly 90 percent of consumers who received EpiPen Auto-Injector or its authorized generic had an out-of-pocket cost of less than $100 and more than 80 percent are paying less than $50."" ""I would still argue that $100 is a lot to pay for a life-saving medication,"" Chua said. ""This is the difference between life and death."" In addition to the Medicaid program, the state purchases drugs for state employees, prisons, and other state-run programs, but the campaign was unable to pin down the effect of the initiative on these groups. Dennis Willard, a campaign spokesman, said 4 million Ohioans would be affected, 2.8 million of whom are on Medicaid or CHIP. Rachel Sachs, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis School of Law, told us that if the initiative worked (she identified various legal issues with it in a blog post), the biggest impact would be felt by state correctional systems, which go unmentioned in the ad. Chua warned that if lowering the price for the privately insured was the goal of Issue 2, this wasn’t the best way forward, as companies could raise costs for private insurers to make up for lost revenue from states like Ohio. Opposition ads make a similar argument, claiming VA prices could also increase in response to the act. Researchers Thomas J. Hwang and Aaron S. Kesselheim evaluated this question when the group proposed a similar initiative in California. (It didn’t pass.) They said that the long-term budgetary effect of the ballot initiative was uncertain. A review claiming causation between a similar 1990 measure and increased VA prices couldn’t be ""credibly established,"" they said. Sachs said that restricting the price pharmaceutical companies can demand from the state of Ohio shouldn’t affect the price they offer private insurers or the VA. That’s because price discrimination makes it so that pharmaceuticals arrange different prices with each market, and there’s no reason to believe they haven’t already struck the best deal possible in each one. While studies suggest cost-shifting, or the displacement of costs on other markets, has little impact on hospitals, Sachs admits there’s insufficient research on this phenomenon in the pharmaceutical industry. In the absence of research on the impact of similar initiatives elsewhere, Gerard Anderson, a professor at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health, said it would be difficult to gauge the proposal’s impact on the privately insured. A pro-Issue 2 ad in Ohio claimed, ""We’ve gone from paying about $100 for Epipens to over $600. And they only hold about one dollar’s worth of medicine. We don’t have a choice but to pay it and the drug companies know it."" There is a key difference in the ""we"" paying $600 -- a relatively small fraction of the privately insured population -- and the population for whom the initiative plans to lower prices. The majority of those covered by state-sponsored insurance, like Medicaid, already pay a $0 co-pay. The campaign didn’t provide evidence of the impact on other state-insured populations, though it could have a significant impact on the smaller prison population, which does not face the same rebates as the Medicaid program. The ballot initiative would have no formal effect on prices for the privately insured, and the trickle-down effect for market prices remains speculative.

"['Income', 'Wealth', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
Is GOP tax reform framework aimed at giving breaks to the middle class, not high-income earners?
","Undaunted by his party’s failure to repeal Obamacare, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin has fixed his sights on the next Republican priority -- tax reform. He says the plan is squarely aimed at helping the middle class. On Sept. 27, 2017, the day President Donald Trump announced the framework of the GOP tax reform proposal, Ryan did a an interview on the Fox News Channel with conservative talk show host Sean Hannity. In it, Ryan stated: People who are low- and middle-income, they’re the ones who are literally living paycheck to paycheck, who are worried about losing their job or they haven’t gotten a raise in years. This is about them and not about people who are really high-income earners getting a break. Ryan made similar statements about the middle class earlier in the interview, as well as the same day at his weekly briefing with reporters and, repeatedly, several days later on CBS’ ""Face the Nation."" So, is the Republican tax reform framework focused on tax breaks for the middle class ""and not about people who are really high-income earners getting a tax break""? What we found are some benefits for the middle class -- but, more clearly, breaks for the rich, as well. Ryan’s argument When Trump unveiled the framework, the New York Times reported that he offered ""scant detail about how working people would benefit from a proposal that has explicit and substantial rewards for wealthy people and corporations."" The Times story added: ""Without more details, it is difficult to show how middle-income families will see the most benefit from the tax overhaul — or if it will favor the richest Americans."" One reason there are questions is that what has been proposed is a framework -- not all of the details have been worked out. Ryan spokesman Ian Martorana argued that while the plan ""reduces rates for everyone, the wealthiest individuals ""will continue to pay at least the same proportion of the country’s taxes.""  He also criticized an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, saying its assumptions about the plan make the analysis ""deeply flawed."" Tax Policy Center director Mark Mazur told us he believes the assumptions are reasonable, given that they are based on previous tax proposals outlined by Ryan and Trump. Key analysis of the framework The Tax Policy Center analysis found: The framework would collapse the seven individual income tax rates -- which range from 10 percent to 39.6 percent -- to three: 12, 25 and 35 percent. The higher percentages are applied to those who make more money. Ryan says the current 10 percent rate is reduced to 0 percent. The framework would also, among other things, increase the standard deduction, eliminate personal exemptions, increase the child tax credit and eliminate most itemized deductions. So, depending on the details, the provisions could all increase or decrease an individual’s federal income tax bill. One bottom line, according to the analysis: The top 1 percent of earners would receive about 80 percent of the tax benefit. This income group would see its after-tax income increase 8.5 percent, whereas the bottom 95 percent of earners would see an average 1.2 percent increase in their after-tax income. Other details from the analysis: In 2018, all income groups would see their average taxes fall, but some taxpayers in each group would face tax increases. Those with the very highest incomes would  receive the biggest tax cuts. In 2027, taxpayers in the 80th to 95th income percentiles   would, on average, experience a tax increase. Looking ahead, in 2027, some higher-income taxpayers would pay more in taxes, but the richest would still get breaks. Taxpayer groups in the bottom 80 percent of the income distribution — those making less than about $150,000 — would receive average tax cuts of 0.5 percent or less of after-tax income. Taxpayers making between about $150,000 and $300,000 would on average pay about $800 more in taxes than under current law. About 80 percent of the total benefit would accrue to taxpayers in the top 1 percent, whose after-tax income would increase 8.7 percent. The analysis also included this important caveat: The framework does not specify the income brackets to which the individual tax rates would apply, nor the maximum size and phase-out parameters of the increased child tax credit. So, to some extent, projections are hard to make. But while some in the middle class are projected to see tax cuts, the better-off do even better, according to the Tax Policy Center analysis. Other analyses Other think tanks have also had to make assumptions about the framework, given its lack of details. Here is what some of them concluded: Tax Foundation, a right-leaning group: It’s projected the plan ""would, on average, lower the tax burden on the bottom 80 percent of households, while slightly raising the tax burden on the top 20 percent of households. The group with the largest gains is households between the 60th and 80th percentile."" New York Times: The proposal ""is a potentially huge windfall for the wealthiest Americans, would not directly benefit the bottom third of the population (and) as for the middle class, the benefits appear to be modest."" Washington Post: ""Most people will pay lower taxes, although it's unclear if the rich get a bigger break than the middle class."" PolitiFact National:  ""The framework appears to favor cuts for wealthier individuals and could increase taxes on some middle class groups."" Our colleagues reached that conclusion in rating Stalled this campaign promise from Trump: ""Everybody is getting a tax cut, especially the middle class."" National Review: ""If they want to avoid raising taxes on a lot of middle-class families while sticking with their framework, Republicans are going to have to plug in the remaining numbers very carefully — and probably going to have to expand the child credit by more than $500 per child."" Cato Institute, a libertarian-oriented group: ""The problem is that ‘middle-class’ Americans pay little in federal income taxes, while ‘lower-income’ Americans pay virtually nothing. So Republican leaders are making promises that will be difficult to keep, and they are distracting themselves from the better message of growth and prosperity for all."" Again, these analyses emphasized that many details have yet to be filled in. Finally, it’s worth noting that some provisions in the framework specifically benefit the well-to-do, as PolitiFact National found in rating False a claim by Trump that the plan has ""very little benefit for people of wealth."" The plan would: Eliminate the alternative minimum tax. This is a calculation that guarantees that certain higher-income taxpayers with large deductions pay at least a minimum amount of tax. Eliminate the estate tax. Currently, for estates worth more than $5.49 million, the estate is generally 40 percent. Reduce from 39.6 percent to 25 percent the tax rate for ""small and family-owned businesses conducted as sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations"" -- collectively, these are referred to as ""passthrough"" income. (Ryan argues that most small-business owners in Wisconsin, after business expenses are considered, are middle-class.) It’s worth noting, as PolitiFact New York found, that the framework would increase the number of people who don’t have to pay federal income tax, although that’s not something that helps the middle class. Our rating Ryan says the Republican tax reform proposal is focused on tax breaks for the middle class ""and not about people who are really high-income earners getting a tax break."" Missing details in the framework for the tax reform make it difficult to tease out exactly how various taxpayers would fare, so it’s possible there will be more for middle-class taxpayers. But based on the framework, while there are some benefits for the middle class, what’s more clear is there are specific provisions benefiting the wealthy. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.

Eric Cantor says ""liberal"" immigration group backs his GOP primary rival, Dave Brat
","U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor, R-7th, is portraying himself as a bastion against illegal immigration in fending off a June 10 primary challenge from Dave Brat, a professor at Randolph-Macon College. ""Just yesterday, a liberal pro-amnesty group held a rally and encouraged their supporters to vote in our election for our opponent because Congressman Cantor is standing up to Obama on illegal immigration,"" Cantor’s campaign said in a May 29 email to supporters. The statement caught PolitiFact’s attention because we attended the May 28 rally at the state Capitol held by Casa de Virginia, a group that supports immigration reform. The speakers certainly needled Cantor, the House majority leader, for not scheduling a vote on a bill to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws. They held signs saying ""Eric Cantor: the one man blocking immigration reform,"" and ""Eric Cantor Give us a vote!"" But we didn’t hear anyone endorse Brat, who accuses Cantor of being soft on immigration. To the contrary, U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., brushed off speculation that the primary was tied to the timing of the rally. ""Some people think we’re here because there’s a primary next week, nothing could be further from the truth,"" Gutierrez said in the keynote speech.  ""The primary is really irrelevant to us. We’re here because the majority leader, Eric Cantor, controls the agenda of the Congress of the United States. And we have come here to say … Stop being an obstacle. Stop being in the way."" Gutierrez said at another point that the primary might be impeding passage of immigration reform. ""Here is the good news, they are going to finally have a primary here in Virginia,"" Gutierrez said. ""Maybe after all the partisan politics are over, we can finally get back to the business of the people of the United States."" We asked Ray Allen Jr., Cantor’s political adviser, for evidence that rally organizers urged those in attendance to support Brat. He pointed to a flier handed out at the event that said, ""Vote *ABC* June 10 -- Anybody But Cantor."" Allen sent us a photo of the flier in a red packet of immigration information that was handed out by organizers of the rally. ""While the flier says vote for anybody but Cantor, Brat is the only anybody on the ballot,"" Allen emailed. ""The intent of the flyer is obvious to all."" But the ""Anybody But Cantor"" flier was not included in the packet the rally organizers gave to the media. A man disseminated the orange sheet before the rally, but his affiliation was unclear. A disclaimer on the bottom of the page provided no clues, saying, ""This message is not authorized by any candidate."" The same man also passed out the flier at news conference Brat held in the Capitol shortly before the rally. Brat used the occasion to question Cantor’s toughness on immigration reform. Zachary Werrell, Brat’s campaign manager said his campaign didn’t pass out the flier and he had no idea who did. Lindolfo Carballo, coordinator of Casa de Virginia, said his group is not connected to the flier. ""It was someone who came to the event before we even started and was passing the flier around,"" he said. ""We asked him to stop. He wasn’t part of our group and the flier wasn’t part of our package."" Carballo said, ""We’re not endorsing anyone. We are just asking Eric Cantor to allow a vote on immigration reform."" As to Cantor’s claim that the group is backing Brat, Carballo said, ""He is going to play this game of his. We are not here to play."" Cantor has declined to schedule a House vote on a comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate last year. The legislation would spend billions on border control and establish a lengthy path to citizenship for many immigrants who entered the country illegally.   Cantor says rather than pass a comprehensive bill, Congress should take a piece-by-piece approach to immigration. The majority leader says he supports a path to citizenship for children who were brought into the country illegally by their parents. On May 16, Cantor announced that he would not allow an amendment to the defense authorization bill that would allow children of illegal immigrants to join the military and receive legal status once they’ve served. Cantor said he supports the concept of the measure, but did not want to attach it to the authorization bill. The majority leader has declined to say when or if he would set up a separate vote for the Enlist Act. Our ruling Cantor says Casa de Virginia, a group supporting immigration reform, endorsed his Republican primary opponent during a May 28 rally in Richmond. Seeking to shore up his conservative support, Cantor cited the action as proof that that he is ""standing up to Obama on illegal immigration."" The problem is that no speaker at the rally issued an endorsement of Dave Brat, Cantor’s opponent. To the contrary, the keynoter stressed that the group was not taking sides in the primary; it was simply calling on Cantor to allow a House vote on immigration reform. Cantor’s campaign points to a flier passed out at the event urging voters to support ""anyone but Cantor"" in the primary. Casa denies any connection to the flier. The missive was not part of an information package Casa distributed at the rally. We know this because we were there. Cantor’s statement is False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097352400>],/factchecks/2014/may/30/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-liberal-immigration-group-backs-h/
"['Oregon', 'Health Care', 'Jeff Merkley']","
Did 400,000 Oregonians gain access to health care under the Affordable Care Act?
 ","Cover Oregon, Oregon’s answer to the Affordable Care Act, has had a rocky rollout. Cost overruns, myriad software bugs and, now, an FBI investigation, added up to a public relations disaster. Despite that, however, thousands of people have enrolled for health coverage. The claim: Jeff Merkley, Oregon’s first-term Democratic senator, is running for re-election and will face Republican challenger and political newcomer Monica Wehby in November. In his first post-primary interview, Merkley conceded the inadequacies of Cover Oregon’s launch but said Obamacare, on the whole, has provided net benefits for the state. In particular, he disputed Wehby’s characterization of the new law as an ""unmitigated disaster."" ""Is it an unmitigated disaster,"" he said, ""that 400,000 Oregonians have gained access to health care"" through the new law? We decided to check Merkley’s figures. The analysis: We emailed Merkley’s campaign staff, which responded with a memo containing three sets of figures, each tied to a news story or government-provided statistic. The first showed that the ACA’s Medicaid expansion increased Oregon Health Plan enrollment by ""more than 300,000."" That total was broken into two pieces: The 201,726 Oregonians who used Cover Oregon to enroll for coverage under the Medicaid expansion that is considered critical to the ACA’s success and an additional 130,000 enrolled in the Medicaid ""fast-track"" program that contacted residents who were already receiving state and federal assistance through other programs. (Potentially, all of them qualified under expansion, so the distinction is did they use Cover Oregon or the Oregon Health Authority fast track?) Oregon Health Plan officials confirmed that there are roughly 320,000 more people officially enrolled in the plan and eligible for coverage now than there were before ACA coverage began Jan. 1, 2014. They acknowledged, however, that they have no way of tracking how many of those individuals had some other type of insurance before enrolling in the state plan. If significant numbers of people did have other insurance before joining the state rolls, that would cut into Merkley’s claim about the new plan’s effect on access to health care. The campaign memo’s next bullet point said ""more than 83,000 individuals have enrolled in private health insurance plans through Cover Oregon."" The actual figure of 83,852 people who bought private plans through the exchange, usually receiving tax credits to do so, came from a Cover Oregon release dated May 27, 2014. In checking that figure, we found a Cover Oregon document labeling those as ""gross enrollment"" figures. As of May 27, 2014, according to the document, at least 5,378 people have had their coverage either canceled or terminated, leaving a net private-enrollment figure of 78,474. The number will likely fall further because policies aren’t considered in effect until the first month’s premium has been paid. Earlier this week, insurers said only about 80 percent of first-month premiums have been paid, meaning the figure could end up closer to 60,000 than the originally cited 83,852. ""In a lot of cases, people still have more time to pay their first premium,"" Cover Oregon spokesman Michael Cox said. ""These numbers, to some extent, are still in flux."" Finally, Merkley’s campaign memo cited a U.S. Health and Human Services document, dated June 19, 2012, which said that 43,000 ""young adults in Oregon"" had gained or kept access to health insurance through their parents’ policies. Those three categories -- Medicaid expansion enrollees, private-coverage users and ""young adults"" -- totals roughly 426,000. That figure matches statistics cited by Cover Oregon. But, as noted above, there are problems with it. Most significantly, officials from two state health agencies say no one is tracking how many of the people enrolled for coverage under Cover Oregon or the Oregon Health Plan already had insurance. It may be fair to assume that many of those who tapped Cover Oregon subsidies, as well as people living near the federal poverty level -- and thus qualifying for the new coverage -- did not have the resources to pay for health insurance. There are two groups here: the private plan people who enrolled using Cover Oregon -- 80 percent of whom used subsidies, and the Medicaid-eligible Oregon Health Plan folks. The ruling: Sen. Jeff Merkley, following his primary victory, turned his sights to his November showdown with GOP nominee Monica Wehby. In disputing Wehby’s statement that Oregon’s health care launch was an ""unmitigated disaster,"" Merkley said ""400,000 Oregonians have gained access to health care"" under the federal Affordable Care Act. To some extent, the numbers are a moving target because they are collected by different groups and may represent totals from varying points in time. They will also change on an ongoing basis as, say, someone makes enough at a new job to lose qualifying status under Medicaid, even as someone else becomes newly eligible after losing work. It is true that the Oregon Health Plan now has about 300,000 more qualifying members than it did before coverage under the ACA began in January. In addition, a 2-year-old federal report adds 43,000 young adults to the mix who were able to remain on their parents’ plan. And anywhere from 60,000 to 83,000 Oregonians who didn’t qualify for Medicaid have purchased private health insurance plans, many with the help of tax credits. So those totals may well make Merkley’s 400,000 claim true. But neither he nor anyone else can say how many of them already had access to health care before the ACA went into effect. Merkley’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A50E80>],/factchecks/2014/may/30/jeff-merkley/did-400000-oregonians-gain-access-health-care-unde/

Chain email falsely claims Obama is only president not to visit D-Day monument
","Off and on for several years, readers have been sending us a chain email that claims, among other things, that President Barack Obama is the only American president in the last 69 years who has failed to visit France’s D-Day Monument on D-Day. With the D-Day anniversary coming up -- the pivotal Allied invasion of Normandy took place on June 6, 1944 -- we thought it was time to check it out again. You can read the full text here. In addition to the claims about Obama, the email also makes false statements about the D-Day anniversary celebrations in Normandy and the number of American forces involved in the battle. The email is fairly lengthy, so we’ll break it down into parts. Obama is the only American president in the last 69 years who has not visited the D-Day Monument on D-Day.  The email claims that since the D-Day invasion in 1944, the United States ""has only four times not been there to do the honors."" The language of the email is ambiguous, but we will assume it is referring to ""there"" as the D-Day Monument in Normandy, rather than also including the monuments in the United States and Britain. There are actually only four American presidents who have visited the D-Day Monument on D-Day. While Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, Ford, Carter and George H.W. Bush all visited France after 1944, they were never there on D-Day. Presidents Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson never went to France at all, according to the State Department. Here are the four who did visit Normandy on D-Day anniversaries: Ronald Reagan attended commemorative ceremonies and delivered the 40th anniversary address in 1984. Bill Clinton gave a speech at the 50th anniversary in 1994. At the 60th anniversary in 2004, George W. Bush delivered an address in Normandy with French President Jacques Chirac. Previously in 2001, Bush spoke at the dedication of the National D-Day Memorial in Bedford, Virginia. And in 2002, he spoke at an event in Normandy on Memorial Day, but it was not associated with D-Day. And the fourth president to speak on D-Day? President Barack Obama, at the 65th anniversary ceremony in 2009, where he dedicated the new visitor center at the U.S. Military Cemetery in Normandy. The email lists events from Obama’s schedules on June 6 of 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, and it’s correct when it says Obama was not at the D-Day anniversary in Normandy in those years. But the email omits mention of the year he was present at the anniversary -- 2009. Making the email’s claim even more ironic is that Obama is scheduled to attend the upcoming 70th anniversary on June 6, 2014 -- which means he would be the only U.S. president to ever visit the D-Day Monument on D-Day twice. For comparison, Snopes.com reported that George W. Bush had no public events connected to D-Day in 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2003, or 2002. Every year the French have a four-day celebration in Normandy complete with American uniforms, tanks, jeeps and guns.  The email is largely correct in stating that the French host a celebration in Normandy every year, but it is not necessarily 4 days long. For instance, in 2004, the 60th anniversary of D-Day was remembered with a 3-day celebration that included 17 official ceremonies between June 5 and 7. This year, 2014, marks the 70th anniversary -- possibly the last decennial anniversary for those who took part in or witnessed the battle. To commemorate this event, Normandy is hosting a 3-month long celebration, from June 5 to August 21. D-Day was ""the largest invasion ever attempted, where 200,000 Americans stormed the beaches at Normandy"" and 6,000 soldiers died. It is true that the invasion of Normandy was the largest land, air and sea operation in the history of warfare. However, the email’s numbers are off when it comes to the troops and casualties involved. Roughly 156,000 Allied troops landed in Normandy on D-Day, but only 73,000 of those were Americans, not 200,000, as the email states. The email also says 6,000 Americans died on D-Day, but this mistakes total casualties for deaths. The D-Day Museum in Britain defines casualties as all losses suffered by the armed forces, including those killed, wounded, missing in action and prisoners of war. There is no official casualty figure for D-Day because of the lack of accurate records, but it is estimated that there were 6,603 American casualties. The U.S. National D-Day Memorial Foundation has recorded the names of individual Allied troops killed on D-Day, verifying 2,499 American fatalities -- not 6,000, as the email says. Our ruling The chain email said that Barack Obama is the only American president who has not visited the D-Day Monument in Normandy on D-Day. This long-circulating email was always wrong -- presidents Reagan, Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama himself had indeed visited the monument in Normandy on D-Day -- but it’s especially wrong now, with Obama scheduled to visit the monument again on D-Day 2014, making him the only president to visit it twice on D-Day.

In 2014, Rick Perry saying he opposes federal government setting minimum wage
","It didn’t surprise us to read that Gov. Rick Perry opposes a hike in the federal minimum wage. Many Republicans do. Our curiosity was stirred by another claim in a May 29, 2014, email to reporters from the Democratic National Committee: ""Perry not only opposes raising the minimum wage… he doesn’t think there should be one."" None whatsoever? The current Texas minimum wage, tied by law to the federal minimum, is $7.25 an hour. Nationally, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 21 states had minimum wages exceeding the federal minimum as of January 2014, while Delaware’s minimum was set to pass the federal minimum as of June 2014. Perry said in a Feb. 21, 2014, appearance on CNN’s Crossfire: ""I don’t think that it’s the government’s business to be setting the minimum wage out there."" A week later, Perry elaborated on Iowa Press, a program on Iowa Public Television. Asked if he would repeal the minimum wage law if it were up to him, Perry said: ""I think you leave that to the small businessmen and women. I mean, the competitive nature of the free market works really well."" Pressed to air a repeal position, Perry replied: ""I don’t know whether I would repeal it or not. But I don’t think that the federal government in Washington, D.C., needs to be… setting... the standard out there. I think"" if "" it’s left to the small businessmen and women of the country, it makes a lot more sense to me."" He added: ""If a state wants to set a minimum wage, that should be that state’s prerogative, but not out of Washington, D.C."" Perry, asked if he would repeal the state minimum wage in Texas if federal law didn’t impose a minimum, said: ""I would leave it up to the Legislature to have a conversation on it and have a good debate about it. You know, is this a job creation or is it a job killer? If it’s killing jobs, I’m not going to be for it."" After we tracked down these appearances, DNC spokeswoman Kiara Pesante offered them up by email as the basis of the group’s claim. Footnote: Perry may not have entertained the prospect of government not setting a minimum wage in the past. According to an Oct. 22, 2006, Houston Chronicle news story on the Texas governor’s race that fall, Perry declined to say if he favored raising the state minimum wage (then $5.15) above the federal level; the story said Perry ""reiterated his support"" for the state’s minimum-wage law as written. We contacted Perry's office about where he stands on this topic and didn't hear back. Our ruling The Democratic committee said Perry doesn’t think there should be a federal minimum wage.

Sullivan claim about federal workers owing on taxes pegs correct figure, fails to acknowledge more of the rest of us are delinquent
","Conservative activist Michael Q. Sullivan stirred our interest with this May 23, 2014, tweet: ""From the ‘Do As I Say Not As I Do’ department: federal employees owe $3.3 billion in back taxes."" By email, the president and ceo of Empower Texans told us he drew his a-ha from an Associated Press news article, posted online May 22, 2014, which opened: ""From workers in Congress and at the White House to active-duty troops, more than 318,000 federal employees and retirees owe just over $3.3 billion in back taxes, the Internal Revenue Service said."" The described tally, effective as of Sept. 30, 2013, included 714 of about 17,000 U.S. Senate and House employees, according to IRS officials, though the data behind its report did not indicate whether members of Congress were delinquent on taxes, the AP reported. Its story said 36 of nearly 1,800 workers at the White House and its agencies owed taxes, though again there was no detailed breakdown. To our inquiry, a Washington, D.C.-based IRS spokesman, Bruce Friedland, emailed the relevant agency chart presenting the number of delinquent workers and retirees for about 100 federal agencies. According to the chart, that $3.3 billion owed was a slight decrease from the $3.38 billion owed by federal workers and retirees a year earlier. The share of delinquent workers and retirees inched up from 3.2 percent to nearly 3.3 percent of all people in those categories, based on 318,462 of nearly 9.8 million total retirees and employees, the chart says. Then again, federal workers and retirees appear to be less widely delinquent than taxpayers in general. The AP story said the IRS estimates at least 8.7 percent of all taxpayers are delinquent. Sullivan, nudged about this aspect, emailed: ""So what?... Federal employees should owe zero."" Our ruling Sullivan tweeted: ""From the ‘Do As I Say Not As I Do’ department: federal employees owe $3.3 billion in back taxes."" That dollar total is correct, though this message didn’t acknowledge that the 3-plus percent of delinquent federal employees and retirees compares to nearly 9 percent of taxpayers in general.

Rep. Steve King says Maxine Waters wins election with fewer votes because of lower turnout
","Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, is one of the most outspoken opponents of illegal immigration in Congress. On May 22, 2014, during a speech on the House floor, he argued that proposals to overhaul immigration laws are a Trojan horse for Republicans, since allowing illegal immigrants a path to citizenship will boost the number of Democratic voters and eventually doom the GOP. This is not the first time King has made this argument. Just over a year ago, King said that Ronald Reagan was wrong to have signed an ""amnesty"" law in 1986 that ""gave Barack Obama about 15 million additional Hispanic votes in 2012."" We found King’s math faulty and rated the claim False. This time, King sought to illustrate what’s at stake electorally by discussing how large immigrant populations can affect congressional elections. He said that while congressional districts are drawn to be roughly equal in population, the number of immigrants -- legal and illegal -- varies widely from district to district. ""If you would go to a district in California like Maxine Waters' district, she only needs about 40,000 to 50,000 votes in her district to get re-elected to the United States Congress,"" King said. ""If you go to my district, it is well over 120,000 votes for me to be re-elected to the United States Congress. ... I have a very, very high percentage of real American citizens that do vote in my district; she has a lower percentage. And I have a higher turnout of people who are responsible enough to vote; she has a lower percentage."" King continued, ""Democrats are happy enough to see the country filling up with people that they get to count when they do a district, because they get a Democrat district that is another vote here in the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker. They want to turn this country into a single-party country."" We thought we’d check whether King, a Republican from northwestern Iowa, was right when he said that Waters, a Democrat who represents a Los Angeles-area district, typically wins her seat in Congress with fewer votes than he does because of lower turnout and a higher illegal immigrant population. First, some background on how congressional districts are drawn. Each state is guaranteed at least one U.S. House seat, and the remainder of the chamber's 435 seats gets divvied up based on the states' total resident population. This means that both citizens and noncitizens are counted by the Census, even though only citizens can vote. This is one of the major reasons why the number of voters can vary from district to district. To check King’s statement, we took a deep dive into election returns for both districts. As we’ll see, King makes some valid points but ignores a few critical factors. First, let’s look at the election results for both lawmakers going back to 2002. The following table includes the votes won by either King or Waters, the number of votes won by the runner-up, the total votes cast for all candidates in the general election, and one-half the total votes cast. What’s important to note here is that the votes ""needed"" to win can either be characterized as one vote more than the runner-up won, or one more vote than half of all votes cast. Remember that King said he needed 120,000 votes to win and Waters needed only 40,000 to 50,000 to win. As you’ll see, King is only partially correct.   Year Winner’s votes Runner-up’s votes Total votes Half of total votes King 2002 113,257 68,853 182,237 91,119 King 2004 168,583 97,597 266,341 133,171 King 2006 105,580 64,181 180,464 90,232 King 2008 159,430 99,601 266,617 133,309 King 2010 128,363 63,160 195,239 97,620 King 2012 200,063 169,470 377,883 188,942 Waters 2002 72,401 18,094 93,407 46,704 Waters 2004 125,949 23,591 156,407 78,204 Waters 2006 82,498 8,343 98,506 49,253 Waters 2008 150,778 24,169 182,579 91,290 Waters 2010 98,131 25,561 123,694 61,847 Waters 2012 143,123 57,771 200,894 100,447   This table shows a big difference in turnout between presidential and non-presidential years. The only years in which half the vote total in Waters’ district is about ""40,000 to 50,000"" (as King put it) are midterm elections. In presidential years, winning half the votes in Waters’ district takes much more than that. The same pattern holds for King -- he has to win ""well over 120,000 votes"" only in presidential years and can get by with nearly 30,000 less than that in midterm elections. So right off the bat, King is cherry picking the elections he’s talking about -- midterm elections for Waters, presidential elections for himself. That said, King has a point that voting totals are consistently higher in his district than in Waters', even if the differences aren’t quite as dramatic as he indicates. According to experts, there are a few reasons for this -- some of which King cited, some of which he didn’t. • King’s district is home to more people than Waters’ district. While in theory congressional districts across the country are supposed to be roughly equal, in practice they tend to vary somewhat. The voting-age population in Waters’ district, which counts just adults and not children, is 517,004, compared to 584,777 in King’s, according to U.S. Census Bureau surveys cited by George Mason University political scientist Michael McDonald. That’s almost 68,000 more voting-age residents for King right off the bat. • Waters has more noncitizens in her district. King has a point that Waters represents more noncitizens, who can’t vote. Waters’ district has 118,576 noncitizens, compared to 20,062 in King’s district. That’s enough of a difference to make a significant dent in the pool of potential voters. • Waters’ district has a disproportionate share of Latinos and Asian-Americans, who tend to vote with less frequency. Even the citizens in Waters’ district who are legal voters are less likely to turn out to vote, which means Waters would need fewer votes to win. So on this point, King is on to something. Almost half of the residents in Waters’ district are of Hispanic origin, and another 13 percent are Asian-American. Nationally, Census Bureau data for 2012 shows that Hispanic turnout was 51.6 percent and Asian-American turnout was 47.3 percent -- both lower than non-Hispanic white turnout (64.1 percent) and African-American turnout (66.2 percent). King has far fewer Hispanics and Asians in his district. • During presidential years, Iowa is a much more competitive state than California, which draws Iowa voters to the polls. No Republican presidential candidate has made a serious play for California in a generation, but Iowa is consistently an up-for-grabs state in the quadrennial presidential showdown. Presidential voter-mobilization efforts by the parties tend to bolster turnout on the margins in Iowa, and the lack of it depresses turnout in California. • King’s district is considerably more competitive electorally than Waters’ is. In the 2012 election, the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan handicapping service, rated King’s district a +5 Republican district, meaning that the GOP presidential candidate performed 9 points better in the district than he did in the nation as a whole. While that doesn’t exactly make King’s seat a toss-up district, it did make it much more competitive than Waters’, which was rated a +26 Democratic district. Why does this matter? Three reasons. First, King is more apt to draw a credible challenger, and a credible challenger is more apt to draw votes, raising the threshold King needs to reach to win. Second, the minority party in King’s district, the Democratic Party, has more of a voter base that will vote for their party’s candidates up and down the ballot. This also raises the threshold King needs to win. Third, generally speaking, the more competitive a race it is, the more it energizes voters to come to the polls. By contrast, the GOP is so weak in Waters’ district that only the most hopeless Republican candidates bother to run against a long-serving incumbent like Waters. This tends to depress the vote in her races: People are apt to think there’s not much of a reason for anyone to come out to the polls. When we ran our assessment by King's office, spokeswoman Sarah Wells said the additional points we raised are all ""viable reasons, but for our purposes we would say that they are factors that lead to lower turnout, rather than additional factors to accompany Mr. King's two points."" That's a judgment call, and one we disagree with. We believe the array of factors calls into question King's decision to zero in on immigration in this comparison. Our ruling In a warning to Republicans about the risks of allowing illegal immigrants a path to citizenship, King said Waters wins election to Congress with fewer votes than he does because of ‘two things’ -- lower turnout and a higher immigrant population. King is correct that both lower turnout rates and a higher population of immigrants who aren’t allowed to vote accounts for some of the difference in their respective vote totals. But he gets some of the key numbers wrong, cherry picks the type of election he’s talking about and ignores the role of the districts’ size, the level of presidential competitiveness and differences in the quality of the competition they face.

A radio advertisement he released on May 27, 2014, faults Attorney General Peter Kilmartin, a Democrat, for his role in the 38 Studios deal, which loaned money to a video game company that ultimately failed. That venture, undertaken with funds approved by the General Assembly, stands to cost Rhode Island $112.6 million over 10 years. In the ad, Hodgson notes that Kilmartin, at the time a state representative, voted for the loan program, which was ushered through the legislature in 2010 by then-House Speaker Gordon Fox. A narrator opens the ad with the words, ""38 Studios. What a disaster."" ""You’d think that Attorney General Peter Kilmartin would tell us which insiders got us into this mess and how much money they made. But Kilmartin can’t do that. He’s been part of the problem from the beginning,"" it continues. ""Peter Kilmartin voted for the $75-million handout that made it all possible. Even worse, as next in command to Gordon Fox, his job at the State House was to get his cronies in the back room, then twist their arms to vote for deals like this. Well, he did a pretty good job with that."" ""So don’t wait for answers on 38 Studios from the attorney general — because they’re not coming. And us? Well, we’re just holding the bag for millions of dollars. Not just this year. Every year. For years. It’s just unbelievable."" Fox was Speaker of the House when that body voted 66 to 1 to approve a $125 million loan guarantee program that set the stage for the $75 million loan to Curt Schilling's 38 Studios. The company was not publicly identified as a potential loan recipient at the time. Kilmartin did, in fact, vote for the bill, although he and other legislators claim they didn’t know at the time that 38 Studios would be a beneficiary. But he wasn’t Fox's second in command when the vote went down, and was not assigned to the role of twisting arms to force support for the ill-fated deal, as the ad suggests. When we contacted Hodgson, he insisted that the ad doesn't actually say that. It simply says that Kilmartin was once Fox's second in command. That's all. Hodgson said the ad is accurate because Kilmartin at one time was the majority whip, a job that requires bringing fellow party members into line for a vote, when Fox was majority leader. But that was only up until Feb. 11, 2010, when Fox became speaker and Kilmartin withdrew from his leadership position because he was contemplating a run for attorney general. The House's vote on the loan guarantee program came on May 25, 2010, when Kilmartin had been out of the whip job for three and a half months. ""I explicitly stayed away from saying (Kilmartin) whipped the 38 Studios bill,"" Hodgson said. ""I was specifically referring to the time period that he was Gordon Fox's subordinate as the House Majority Whip."" But he wasn't specific at all. And that's not the impression his ad leaves. From start to finish, the ad talks about 38 Studios. The title on YouTube is ""Answers on 38 Studios."" The ad talks about Kilmartin's vote in favor of the loan program. The fact that Kilmartin was Fox's second in command, the ad says, is ""even worse."" But at the time of the vote, Kilmartin wasn't Fox's second in command. He didn't even have a leadership position. Hodgson is taking facts that he knows are unrelated and linking them to give the impression that Kilmartin played a larger role in passing the 38 Studios bill than he actually did. ""I was taking multiple time periods of his service and putting them into a combined time period,"" Hodgson said. ""I stand behind every word of that ad. We drew it very carefully to withstand PolitiFact."" Apparently he's unaware that PolitiFact's judges also take context into consideration.   Hodgson’s ad seems deliberately crafted to give the erroneous impression that Kilmartin worked with Fox to secure votes for the 38 Studios deal.     Taken in that context, Hodgson's claim commands a less-than-accurate rating on the Truth-O-Meter. We rate it Mostly False.

Democrats misfire with criticism of Deal on HOPE
","Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, went on the attack just one day after Georgia’s primary election. Shumlin was on MSNBC promoting state Sen. Jason Carter, his party’s nominee for governor of Georgia, and pouncing on Gov. Nathan Deal, Carter’s GOP opponent. ""Nathan Deal cut the HOPE scholarship program so that literally 100,000 Georgians will not be able to go to college or get technical training that they so badly needed to raise -- you know, give them a chance at a good job,"" Shumlin said. The HOPE scholarship program, which is funded by lottery sales, is sacrosanct in Georgia. Since the mid-1990s, HOPE has given tens of thousands of students the chance to attend a college, university or technical college. PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know whether Shumlin was correct. Did Deal slash the HOPE program to the detriment of 100,000 students? Deal pushed through several changes to HOPE in his first year in office that he said were needed to ensure its long-term viability. He took similar steps with the state’s popular universal and voluntary pre-kindergarten program, which also is funded by lottery ticket sales. The changes to HOPE, which had Republican and Democrat backing, were effective for fiscal 2012, which started July 1, 2011. For the first time, technical college students had to maintain a 3.0 grade-point average -- instead of a 2.0 -- to qualify for a HOPE grant. For all but the top students, HOPE awards were cut -- to cover about 90 percent of tuition costs (now about 80 percent). Another new requirement meant students had to start college within seven years of their high school graduation in order to receive a HOPE scholarship. The fallout was immediate. At the technical colleges, for example, the share of students receiving HOPE dropped from 74 percent in 2011 to 54 percent in 2013. They included 11,471 students who lost HOPE because their GPAs straddled between 2.0 and 3.0. A chart on the Georgia Student Finance Commission website documents what happened. It shows: -- 256,380 students were receiving scholarships and grants, totaling nearly $748 million, in 2010-2011, the year before the program was changed. -- 214,671 students received scholarship/grant awards, worth a combined $529 million, for the 2011-2012 fiscal year, the first year of the changes; -- and in 2012-2013, 193,876 students were on HOPE at a cost of $501 million. The result: 62,504 fewer HOPE recipients. That’s a lot. But it’s not 100,000. So where did Shumlin get that 100,000 students who lost HOPE? We reached out to the Democratic Governors Association, where spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told us the 100,000 figure came from an Atlanta Magazine article published in January 2014. The article showed 256,392 students on HOPE in 2011 and 148,331 in the scholarship/grant program in 2014, for a difference of about 108,000. The problem: The article included data for only part of 2014. (The 2014 Fiscal Year doesn’t end until June 30, 2014.) It should be noted that, according to Tracy Ireland, president of the Student Finance Commission, the 2014 figures were omitted from the agency’s website beginning in late April due to a computer error and were not reposted until May 23, after Shumlin’s MSNBC appearance and after PolitiFact started making calls for this fact check. The agency also went back May 23 and adjusted the website report to show more grant and scholarship awards than had previously been reported. (Award totals for fiscal 2012 were changed from 202,891, as shown on the website earlier in May, to 214,671. The fiscal 2013 awards were revised from 173,723 to 193,876). The numbers were changed, in part, to include students who received the Zell Miller Scholarship in fiscal years 2012, 2013 (as well as 2014) and others who received the new Strategic Industries Workforce Development grants, Ireland said. Both the scholarship and grant are funded by HOPE. Ireland said officials previously planned to add those numbers as part of a website rewrite, but instead updated them May 23. Democrats called the revisions suspicious. ""They are actively revising numbers to make the governor look better in an election year when his opponent is making this a key issue,"" said Bryan Thomas, a spokesman for Carter. Data on the Student Finance Commission’s website in early May showed there were 82,682 fewer HOPE scholarship/grant recipients between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2013. (The numbers are not independently audited, according to Ireland.) More to consider No one disputes that the changes to HOPE contributed to coinciding enrollment declines (Enrollment in the state’s technical colleges went from 195,366 in 2011 to 151,150 in 2013 and from 318,027 to 309,469 in the University System of Georgia in the same period.) But there’s more to know about the numbers. State officials say other factors likely played a role in the drop in HOPE awards and enrollment. Technical colleges moved during this period from quarters to semesters, causing some temporary upheaval. Likely more importantly, the state was starting to rebound from what’s generally referred to as the Great Recession. ""Changes to the (HOPE] program had an impact,"" Ireland said. ""But the improving economy also affected enrollment negatively."" Colleges and technical schools typically see enrollment increases during economic slumps and decreases as the job market improves, said Mike Light, a spokesman for the Technical College System of Georgia. Earlier this month, Ron Jackson, the agency’s commissioner, wrote Jason Carter after learning Carter was being quoted in the media as saying technical college enrollment is off 45,000, largely due to changes in the HOPE grant program. Jackson said technical colleges added nearly 45,000 students between 2008 and 2010, the peak of the Great Recession. Their enrollment of 151,150 students last year was closer to the colleges’ pre-recession numbers and follows a decline in two-year college enrollment, he wrote Carter. The picture also for some HOPE recipients isn’t as bleak as it first seemed, Jackson said. Of those 11,471 students who could not meet the 3.0 GPA requirement, 2,341 remained in college and graduated. An additional 2,341 came back after the GPA requirement was returned to 2.0 in 2013, he said. Claire Suggs, a senior education policy analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, agreed that there’s no way to know exactly how many students fell off the HOPE rolls as a result of the policy changes pushed by Deal. ""We do know HOPE was a significant driver [in the decline in scholarship and grant awards],"" Suggs said.. The "" immediate plunge"" in awards after the changes were enacted makes that apparent, she said. The Student Finance Commission’s Ireland said the program changes had to be made. In fiscal 2011, agency projections showed that the costs of lottery-funded programs were outstripping new lottery revenues at an accelerating rate. If unchecked, lottery reserves would have been depleted by the end of fiscal 2013, he said. Brian Robinson, a spokesman for Deal, said Democrats’ numbers are ""flat wrong and their analysis is sheer speculation."" ""We saved HOPE,"" Robinson said. ""We maintain the most generous scholarship program in the nation. Vermont should be so lucky."" He said Georgia’s technical college enrollment went down because 240,000 new jobs have been created in Deal’s tenure. ""That's a big reason technical college enrollment declined,"" Robinson said. Our conclusion: The number of students who receive HOPE grants and scholarships to attend universities, 2-year, 4-year or technical colleges fell off after changes to the program were enacted in the fiscal year that started July 1, 2011. Those changes undoubtedly were a big factor. Numbers on the Student Finance Commission website show 62,504 fewer HOPE scholarship and grant recipients in the first two years after the new rules were put in place. But state officials say other facts were at play, including the improving economy. Shumlin relied on a magazine article, which included data from only part of a year. There is some truth in his statement. The number of HOPE recipients are down. But they are not down as much as Shumlin said. And  the declines can be attributed to a variety of factors. We rate his statement  Half True .",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B0EA40>],/factchecks/2014/may/30/peter-shumlin/target-deal-hope-mark/

Claim that solar panels drain the sun’s energy is satire, not science
","Recently, several readers -- feeling depressed after reading that a promising type of clean, renewable energy was seemingly weakening the earth’s very life force -- asked us to check a claim circulating on social media that ""solar panels drain the sun’s energy."" Rest easy, readers: The claim stems from a bit of satire being passed along by the scientifically gullible. In mid May 2014, the website National Report published an article headlined, ""Solar Panels Drain the Sun’s Energy, Experts Say."" Here’s an excerpt: ""This week, a scientific research facility in Wyoming made a startling discovery that is certain to change the way millions of Americans look at the environmentalism movement, after they found conclusive evidence that solar panels not only convert the sun’s energy into usable energy, but that they are also draining the sun of its own energy, possibly with catastrophic consequences far worse than global warming. ""Scientists at the Wyoming Institute of Technology, a privately-owned think tank located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, discovered that energy radiated from the sun isn’t merely captured in solar panels, but that energy is directly physically drawn from the sun by those panels, in a process they refer to as ‘forced photovoltaic drainage.’ ""‘Put into laymen’s terms, the solar panels capture the sun’s energy, but pull on the sun over time, forcing more energy to be released than the sun is actually producing,’ WIT claims in a scientific white paper published on Wednesday. ‘Imagine a waterfall, dumping water. But you aren’t catching the water in buckets, but rather sucking it in with a vacuum cleaner. Eventually, you’re going to suck in so much water that you drain the river above that waterfall completely.’ ""WIT is adamant that there’s no immediate danger, however. ‘Currently, solar panels are an energy niche, and do not pose a serious risk to the sun. But if we converted our grids to solar energy in a big way, with panels on domestic homes and commercial businesses, and paving our parking lots with panels, we’d start seeing very serious problems over time. If every home in the world had solar panels on their roofs, global temperatures would drop by as much as thirty degrees over twenty years, and the sun could die out within three hundred to four hundred years.’"" However, people passing along this story by email appear not to be aware that the National Report is a satire site. As we noted just a few days ago in another check of a National Report piece that went viral, the site’s tongue-in-cheek disclaimer says, in part, that ""the views expressed by writers on this site are theirs alone and are not reflective of the fine journalistic and editorial integrity of National Report."" The urban-legend investigation site Snopes.com has archived an even clearer disclaimer that has since been removed. The former disclaimer said, ""National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental."" (Snopes also debunked the solar panels story on May 25, 2014.) We checked with a solar energy expert to make sure we weren’t missing something, and they agreed that the sun-draining claim is pure hokum. ""The sun is really big, really far away, and constantly producing mind-boggling amounts of energy through nuclear fusion. It couldn’t care less about your puny solar panel,"" said Mark Thurber, associate director of Stanford University’s Program on Energy and Sustainable Development. The closer you read the National Report item, the more obvious the satire becomes. It turns out that the Wyoming Institute of Technology only exists as a website, with an obviously fake backstory. ""WIT,"" according to the website, was originally founded in 1943 as the Wyoming Institute of Education and Nuclear Energy Research (WIENER, get it?) and has purportedly invented such technologies as ""smellovision,"" the ""space toilet,"" the world’s first computer virus, ""the world’s first 100% organic artificial nose, which was created for pop-star Michael Jackson in 1999,"" and the ""E-condom."" Our ruling As is often the case, what you see on social media isn’t accurate. It’s not true that ""solar panels drain the sun’s energy."" This claim originated with a satirical site, and it has no basis in science. Cue the solar flares: It gets a Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A47FDC0>],/factchecks/2014/may/29/chain-email/claim-solar-panels-drain-suns-energy-are-satire-no/
"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Marijuana', ""Don't Let Florida Go To Pot""]","
Less than 5 percent of medical marijuana users have cancer or AIDS, opposition group says
","One of the biggest question marks over Florida’s proposed medical marijuana amendment is over who will use it. According to an opposition group, it’s not who you may think. Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot, a campaign run by a coalition of more than 40 organizations opposing Amendment 2, says on its website that most patients don’t suffer from the life-threatening diseases often associated with medical marijuana use. ""Less than 5 percent of registered users in states allowing medical marijuana have cancer or AIDS,"" it says. The site ramped up earlier in May, and is run by St. Petersburg lobbyist group Save Our Society From Drugs. They use information from the Florida Sheriffs Association. Cancer and AIDS are often cited by proponents of medical marijuana as the diseases that marijuana can help. We were curious to know if it’s true that only 5 percent of patients who use the drug have those two diseases. Let’s check the registries and find out. Playing percentages Florida’s Amendment 2 specifically names cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, hepatitis C, ALS, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis as eligible for treatment. It also allows for ""other conditions for which a physician believes that medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks for a patient."" That provides doctors plenty of latitude to make recommendations for things not on the list, like chronic pain or muscle spasms. Marijuana is typically recommended to cancer patients to treat nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy treatments. AIDS patients often use it to treat nausea, pain and loss of appetite. The big problem with tracking why medical marijuana patients use the drug is that the rules and record-keeping vary widely among the 21 states that allow it. Eric Pounders, spokesman for the Florida Sheriffs Association, said the 5 percent figure comes from an average Save Our Society From Drugs calculated from data from 15 states, which all report things in different ways. For example, statistics from Rhode Island say 4 percent of users there have cancer, and 1 percent have HIV/AIDS. New Jersey says 2.3 percent use marijuana for a terminal illness. Vermont allows conditions to remain confidential. Washington has no database of users or their conditions. California has no mandatory patient registration. The Marijuana Policy Project, a national group that tracks state regulations and favors the Florida amendment, says only six states routinely update comprehensive user data, so Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot’s list of 15 states is suspect. Karen O’Keefe, the project’s director of state policies, says a state like Alaska (which Pounders cited) doesn’t keep very accurate records on patients at all. At any rate, the numbers reflect a trend among the states that report conditions: A very small number of medical marijuana patients have cancer or AIDS. Opponents think that’s a big problem. ""We want to show Floridians that the disease groups they are constantly hearing about, are not the ones that marijuana is primarily treating,"" Pounders said. He said pro-marijuana groups often use those two diseases to appeal to people’s sympathies. Dr. Gary Reisfield, from the University of Florida’s psychiatry department, agreed. While he said the 5 percent was comparable to research he’d seen, the outsized use of the two diseases as an example was a smokescreen by advocates. ""Cancer and HIV are the camel's nose under the tent,"" he told PolitiFact Florida. ""Physicians, most of whom favor medical cannabis legislation, will acquiesce to their patients' demands for cannabis for other ‘debilitating conditions,’ like pain, muscle spasm, headaches, insomnia and anxiety."" Those are the kinds of conditions for which most patients are treated, said Dr. Barth Wilsey of the University of California Davis Medical Center. He pointed to a University of Michigan study last year that found 87 percent of sample patients from a Michigan clinic sought medical marijuana for pain relief, either on its own or in conjunction with other conditions. Cancer was cited as 3.4 percent of the sample and people with AIDS were combined with hepatitis C under ""chronic infection,"" and totaled 2.3 percent. Wilsey added that doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with patients wanting to relieve pain, especially because most medical marijuana patients turn to the drug only after exhausting other options. He said he thought Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot was ""trivializing"" patients suffering from very real medical issues. ""The significance of this statement is tempered by the fact that millions of Americans suffer from chronic pain. One type, neuropathic pain, is particularly difficult to treat,"" Wilsey said. ""One thing is certain, we need more research on medical marijuana and less decision-making by legislatures and referendums."" Our ruling Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot said ""less than 5 percent of registered users in states allowing medical marijuana have cancer or AIDS."" The medical marijuana opponents that run the website said they estimated their total using figures from states with current laws allowing the drug. Not all states report figures the same way, however, or may not report them at all. Patients who don’t have cancer or AIDS still may have legitimate reasons to use medical marijuana, including for pain relief. So the statistic Don't Let Florida Go to Pot cites isn't perfect. But the available evidence does suggest fairly strongly that the people who use medical marijuana for cancer or AIDS is a small percentage of all users. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097216B00>],/factchecks/2014/may/29/dont-let-florida-go-pot/less-5-percent-registered-users-states-allowing-me/
"['Labor', 'State Budget', 'Workers', 'Wisconsin', 'Brett Hulsey']","
Brett Hulsey says Mary Burke would have required the same benefit cuts that Scott Walker did with Act 10
","Democrat Brett Hulsey says that any union member who supports Mary Burke ""is like a chicken who votes for Colonel Sanders."" Them’s fightin’ words -- and they’re aimed at a fellow Democrat vying to take on Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the November election. Hulsey, a state representative from Madison and former vice president of a union local at a Sierra Club office, alleges outsourcing of jobs by Trek Bicycle when Burke was a Trek board member. Hulsey is also displeased with Burke’s support of a charter school in Madison, where she is on the school board. But what really miffs Hulsey is Burke saying it was ""reasonable"" and ""fair"" for public employees to pay more toward their state-funded pensions and health insurance in 2011. In his controversial move to sharply limit collective bargaining, Walker and fellow Republicans imposed those cost-sharing moves on state employees and cleared the way for local governments to do the same. It was part of the law known as Act 10. Hulsey is accusing Burke of Walker-like anti-union behavior regarding those benefits and other issues. She supports ""taking"" public servants’ healthcare and retirement benefits, Hulsey claimed in a May 21, 2014 news release. And in a letter to Burke in advance of the South Central Federation of Labor’s annual bean feed, a long-running celebration sponsored by the Madison-based labor union umbrella group, Hulsey wrote: ""You told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that you would have required workers to give up bargained for healthcare and retirement benefits like Gov. Walker."" Is Hulsey right? Burke’s statements on Act 10 Burke, who entered the governor’s race in early October 2013, has been remarkably consistent in her comments on Act 10. As support for his claim, Hulsey cites an April 18, 2014 interview with the Journal Sentinel in which Burke said she would work to restore collective bargaining for public workers while still seeking efficient government. In the interview, Burke said: ""If I had been governor I would have made sure I bargained for the changes that needed to be made to balance the state budget. I think it was only fair to ask for contributions to health care and pensions but I think those could have been negotiated, certainly firmly but fairly."" Walker’s approach, she said, left the state divided and has caused teachers and prospective educators to question whether salaries and benefits will be sufficient to support their careers and pay off student loans. ""Wisconsin walked away from the table and left it in a worse place,"" Burke said. So, Burke staked out a somewhat nuanced position. She defended getting public workers to pay more. She said she’d have negotiated over the pension and health changes, in contrast to Walker’s approach of removing those as subjects of bargaining. And she suggested she could have achieved a result similar to Walker’s by being firm in her ""ask"" for the benefits changes. Could she have? That’s debatable. In 2011, some union leaders at one point said they’d agree to the benefits givebacks. But that was under extreme pressure because Walker had the votes for the stringent limits on bargaining -- and a ban on employers from deducting union dues from employee paychecks. In any event, it’s clear from Burke’s comments that she wanted a similar result on pension and healthcare cost-sharing as Walker, but wouldn’t -- and couldn’t -- have ""required"" workers to pay more. That’s because, she said, she’d have negotiated to try to get that. But her comments also suggest she would have made a high priority of getting those ""fair"" givebacks in exchange for something else. Burke’s comments have been met with disappointment from some quarters on the left and among union leaders, but she’s received endorsements from the largest state employee union, major teachers unions and the state AFL-CIO. They said her support is clear for collective bargaining, which she described as ""something that I believe in and think is right for our state,""  in an appearance on The Devil’s Advocates radio show. Meanwhile, Hulsey is making a full-throated pledge to try to repeal Act 10 as a whole, including the benefits cuts, saying the cuts were not necessary. He has pledged to provide back pay to workers whose wages declined because of the act. Hulsey told us that Burke’s comments -- that she would have negotiated the benefits changes she needed -- amount to an approach that would have ""required"" the cuts of workers, ""just in a more humane way"" than Walker. Our rating Hulsey claimed Burke told Journal Sentinel reporters and editors that she ""would have required workers to give up bargained-for healthcare and retirement benefits like Gov. Walker."" There’s an element of truth here in that Burke did say she backed benefits cuts in the same areas as Walker got, and was confident she could have achieved them. But Hulsey’s phrasing makes it sound like Burke backs Walker’s approach. That’s a huge stretch given that she would have left collective bargaining intact and tried to negotiate the cost-cutting moves.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'Congress', 'Eric Cantor']","
Eric Cantor says Senate immigration reform efforts are the Obama-Reid amnesty plan
","House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is facing his most significant primary challenge since he first won the Republican nomination for his Virginia congressional seat in 2000. With a few weeks to go before the June 10 election, he has hammered his opponent, Randolph-Macon College professor Dave Brat, on the air with negative ads while seeking to boost his own conservative credentials. In short, he’s taking the challenge seriously. Cantor’s latest attempt is to brand himself as a staunch critic of immigration reform efforts that passed the Senate last year but have stalled in the Republican-controlled House. According to reports, the GOP leader sent out a campaign mailer that claims Cantor is ""stopping the (President Barack) Obama-(Sen. Harry) Reid plan to give illegal immigrants amnesty."" He went on to claim the ""liberal plan would give six million illegal aliens citizenship."" The timing of the flier is interesting; just last week, Cantor reaffirmed his support of a plan that would give citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants who enter the U.S. military. Some might call that amnesty. But let’s go back to the Senate plan and take a look at whether Cantor’s mailer is an accurate portrayal of the bill. Is it amnesty? We asked Cantor’s campaign to explain the language of the ad to us. They didn’t respond. Is it reasonable to call the Senate bill ""amnesty""? In the past, we’ve said yes and no, generally settling on Half True. In addition to spending billions on new border control measures, the bill also seeks to address the status of the 11.5 million undocumented immigrants already residing in the United States. Some of those individuals would be eligible for a pathway to citizenship. In that respect, the bill does include an amnesty provision, because in legalese, the previous offense (in this case entering the country illegally) is eventually forgiven. But the path to citizenship is not without significant hurdles and the bill does not ""give"" away citizenship status, as Cantor portends in his campaign literature. For many people, it would take up to 13 years before they are legally citizens. And it’s not free, either. The bill would allow people to seek ""Registered Provisional Immigrant Status,"" by demonstrating residence in the United States prior to Dec. 31, 2011, having no felony convictions and not more than two misdemeanors and paying a $500 penalty plus back taxes. Another $500 would be required after six years. After 10 years under Registered Provisional Immigrant Status, a person could pay $1,000 and seek a green card using a new merit-based system. People brought here illegally as minors, known as ""Dreamers,"" and some agricultural workers would get green cards in five years, versus the 10 for everyone else who qualifies. New security measures would have to be underway before unauthorized immigrants could begin that process, however. Is it Obama and Reid’s bill? Obama and Senate Majority Leader Reid both support the Senate immigration bill. Reid voted for it, and Obama has called on the House to take up the legislation. But it’s a tough sell to pin the bill entirely to those two Democratic leaders, and by calling it a 'liberal"" plan, Cantor conveniently leaves out that it had sizeable Republican backing. For starters, the bill is largely the product of the so-called ""Gang of Eight,"" a group of four Democratic and four Republican senators who spent months working on the legislation before successfully ushering it through the upper chamber. Obama’s efforts were mostly behind the scenes. Perhaps the most significant addition to the Gang of Eight was Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who joined Republican Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and added a critical conservative and Latino voice to the debate.  Someone on the left could just as easily call it the Rubio-Graham plan. It's far more accurate to label it a bipartisan proposal. The four Republicans in the ""gang"" weren’t the bill’s only GOP supporters, either. When it passed 68 to 32 in June 2013, 14 Republicans eventually voted for it. The Democratic caucus supported it unanimously, supplying the other 54 votes. Still, that makes it about as bipartisan a measure as you’ll see pass out of the Senate on such a controversial topic these days. While many conservative groups have come out against the Senate bill, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a right-of-center organization, has backed the immigration reform efforts, as have faith-based groups that more often side with the GOP on social issues. That’s not to say it’s not a contentious or politically charged piece of legislation. But characterizing it Reid and Obama's liberal bill is a distortion of reality. Our ruling In recent campaign literature, Cantor said the Senate immigration bill is ""liberal"" and the ""Obama-Reid plan to give illegal immigrants amnesty."" Reasonable people might consider this amnesty, but it’s a much more rigorous path to citizenship than Cantor lets on in his flier. It’s certainly not a ""give"" away. Further, the plan had significant support from both sides of the aisle, both inside the Senate and from outside organizations. The bipartisan Gang of Eight is credited with putting together the package, not Obama and Reid. Weighing all of that, we think Cantor is intentionally misleading Virginia voters on this issue.

Charlie Crist says 41,200 veterans lack health care due to Rick Scott not expanding Medicaid in Florida
","As Memorial Day approached, both Gov. Rick Scott and his anticipated Democratic rival Charlie Crist called on Veterans Administration Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign amid news reports that VA staff falsified documentation about how long veterans were waiting to receive health care. But then Crist pointed the finger at Scott in a series of tweets on May 22 and 23: • ""In addition -- if I were governor, I would take immediate action to make sure our veterans here in FL are getting the care they need."" • ""I’d call a special session to expand health care to the more than 41,000 FL vets who are left w/o coverage due to Scott’s failure."" • ""41.2k vets in FL don’t have health care because Scott didn't expand Medicaid. Unconscionable."" It was that last tweet that caught our eye. We decided to fact-check the number Crist cited and whether they lack health care because Scott failed to expand Medicaid. Florida rejects Medicaid expansion Medicaid is an insurance program operated by states in partnership with the federal government to care for low-income people. The Affordable Care Act aimed to expand the program. Specifically, the law would cover all costs for the first three years for states to extend Medicaid to households earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level — which in 2013 was $15,865 for an individual, $32,499 for a family of four. Scott, who campaigned on his opposition to Obamacare, initially opposed Medicaid expansion. But in February 2013 he changed his position and came out in support of it. Scott didn’t push the Republican-led Legislature to approve it, and ultimately legislators rejected it. The result is that now more than 800,000 uninsured Floridians earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to qualify for subsidies to help buy insurance in the federal marketplace. Urban Institute study  About 40 percent of veterans nationwide are on VA care. Generally, veterans have to serve for two consecutive years and not be discharged dishonorably to be eligible for VA health care, which gives priority to those with service-related injuries or who are low income. Also, some veterans choose not to enroll in VA care, for example, if they don’t live near any VA facilities. Some veterans who either aren’t eligible or choose not to enroll in VA could be eligible for Medicaid. In tweeting his attack, Crist linked to a March 2013 nationwide study by the Washington-based Urban Institute. The study analyzed U.S. Census Bureau data to estimate how many military veterans aged 19 to 64 don’t have insurance. (Veterans 65 and older qualify, like other Americans, for Medicare.) The study found that 535,000 uninsured veterans nationwide would qualify for Medicaid or new subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. However, the majority would only qualify for Medicaid if their state chose to expand it. The institute’s report said in Florida there were 103,700 non-elderly veterans who lacked health insurance, which included 41,200 who would qualify for Medicaid if the state expanded the program. We ran the study by Jack Tsai, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale who co-wrote a separate study about the number of uninsured veterans and Medicaid expansion, but didn’t include a state-by-state breakdown. Tsai said that the methodology of the Urban Institute study is ""fairly solid."" However, he noted it is based on data from a few years ago, and that Crist’s statement didn’t include details about the study’s limitations. There are various reasons why some veterans remain uninsured: Some might feel they don’t need insurance or haven’t gotten around to obtaining it or may not be aware of their VA eligibility or don’t want anything to go to the VA. Likewise, there might be similar reasons to not enroll with Medicaid, while others could be in between jobs. We asked spokespersons for the governor’s office and his campaign if they had any evidence to refute Crist’s claim.  Campaign spokesman Greg Blair reiterated that Scott supported Medicaid but the Legislature didn’t go along with it. He also pointed to 2011 Medicaid reform intended to lower the cost of health care. Our ruling Crist said in a tweet that 41,200 veterans in Florida ""don’t have health care because Scott didn’t expand Medicaid."" Crist’s tweet linked to a map that cited the Urban Institute study showing the number of uninsured veterans in each state that might qualify for the Medicaid expansion. Crist’s tweet omits two major points: Some of those 41,200 veterans could get health care other ways. It’s possible some are eligible for services through the VA but for a variety of reasons haven’t sought those benefits. Also, Scott’s not solely responsible for Florida failing to expand Medicaid. After Scott opposed the expansion, he came out in support of it in February 2013. But Scott didn’t lobby for it, and the Legislature rejected it last year.

"['Crime', 'PunditFact', 'Guns', 'Pierre Thomas']","
ABC's Thomas: Mass shootings have tripled since 2000
","The brutal murders May 23, 2014, near the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara, dominated the national news and provoked a lot of talk about what could have been done to save the lives of six young college-aged victims. The public quickly learned the basics. The killer had a history of mental illness. He revealed his plans in a YouTube video posted shortly before his rampage. He killed his first three victims, his roommates, with a knife. He legally owned three handguns and used at least one of them to kill three strangers before committing suicide. In a search for some pattern, ABC’s This Week host, Martha Raddatz asked ABC senior justice correspondent Pierre Thomas about deadly gunfire on or near college campuses since 1996. ""Officials you talk to say there really is a spike nationwide,"" Raddatz said. ""The problem is, it's even bigger than that,"" Thomas said. ""Between 2008 and 2000 roughly, we were averaging about five mass shootings a year. We're now averaging 15. So that's a three-fold increase."" That seemed like a major jump. Does the country really have three times as many mass shootings? We decided to take a closer look. We reached out to Thomas to learn what background information he was using and did not hear back. However, we found an FBI study that, while it ultimately doesn’t support his claim, does offer some numbers that sound very much like the ones Thomas used. Pete Blair, director of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center at Texas State University was the lead researcher on the study Active Shooter Events from 2000 to 2012. Blair found that from 2000 to 2008, there were about five events each year where someone with a gun attempted to kill multiple people. But after 2008 there were nearly 16 each year. That matches the tripling that Thomas described. The problem is, Thomas talked about mass shootings. That’s not the violence Blair studied. In about 20 percent the cases Blair looked at, no one died. In more than 10 percent of the cases, only one person was killed. Neither scenario meets the definition of a mass shooting. Blair explained that the FBI’s focus was on crafting strategies to save lives once a gunman arrives. ""Active shooter is a response protocol for the police,"" Blair said. ""We believe that we can learn as much from events that do not turn into mass killings as those that do."" Blair found that about half the time, the incidents are over before police arrive and the most common reason is that the shooter commits suicide. In research circles, there is no hard and fast definition for a mass shooting. Instead, the FBI uses the term ""mass murder"" when four or more people are killed in what is essentially a single episode. By that definition, Blair said there has been no increase in mass shootings. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston, told PunditFact the rate of mass murders has held steady for decades. ""Since 1976, we’ve averaged about 20 cases a year,"" Fox said. ""On average, about 100 people a year are killed by mass murderers."" The data on killings is fraught with analytic pitfalls. USA Today researchers found that the FBI’s homicide data is accurate only about 60 percent of the time. On top of that, different studies look at different kinds of events. For example, Fox includes killings within families and murders committed during burglaries in his tally. In contrast, the magazine Mother Jones did an extensive investigation that aimed to identify instances where at least four people were murdered and the motive was indiscriminate killing in a public setting. Researchers eliminated cases where the violence took place in a home or was tied to a robbery or gang warfare. (Those standards might exclude the Santa Barbara slayings because three of the victims were the killer’s roommates and were slain in their apartment. Nor would it be correct to call them shootings because they were stabbed to death.) Using its approach, Mother Jones found that the rate of these killings has gone up over time. During the period 2000 to 2008, there were 1.8 mass murders a year. From 2009 to 2013, the rate doubled to 3.6 events per year. This shows an increase, but not as large as Thomas suggested. There’s another way to slice the data. Criminologist Gary Kleck at Florida State University went beyond homicides and focused on any event in which seven or more people were killed or injured in a single location. By his tally, the yearly average between 2000 and 2008 was 2.4 events, compared to 5 events per year after 2008. This offers some support for Thomas’s statement but again, the numbers are quite different from the ones he used. Our ruling Thomas said that mass shootings have tripled since the 2000 to 2008 period and the country now sees about 15 episodes a year. The study that matches those figures looked at a different form of violence and included instances where no one was murdered. The study’s author told us that mass murders, as defined by the FBI, have not increased. Using a more narrow definition, Mother Jones found that the country now has between three and four mass killings a year, a doubling since about a decade ago. Another study that looked at the number of people wounded, not necessarily killed, offered similar results. The annual rate is much lower than Thomas said and the change in the rate is also considerably less. There is some evidence that mass killings have increased but that finding hinges on a careful choice of incidents, and by any measure, Thomas’ numbers are way off. We rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976D9100>],/factchecks/2014/may/28/pierre-thomas/abcs-thomas-mass-shootings-have-tripled-2000/

Sarah Palin: Federal government spending tax money on 'Zombie Apocalypse Plan'
","Sarah Palin’s Facebook page is a popular venue where her 4.2 million fans can track her political endorsements, follow her reality TV appearances and join in on her outrage about how the country is being run. Recently, the former GOP vice presidential nominee and Alaska governor made an ""unbelievable"" connection between the abuse of tax dollars and zombies. ""As unbelievable as it sounds, your tax dollars are funding the federal government's Zombie Apocalypse Plan. I kid you not,"" Palin wrote May 22. ""(Google it; it really is the strangest thing. It’s not like government isn't trillions in debt and wasting billions of your dollars everyday ... but I digress.)"" We took her advice to heart and did some digging. After a few Internet searches and some interviews, we found this: The government does not have a plan for the zombie apocalypse. We repeat: There is no zombie apocalypse plan. ""Nor do we conduct any research or know of any viruses or other conditions that would result in zombie-type behavior,"" said Centers for Disease Control spokesman Llelwyn Grant. That’s probably not all-too surprising given the lack of real-life zombies. But since Palin was so matter-of-fact about the plan being real, we’ll explain where she got her information. Palin’s claim is based on a public outreach strategy developed by the communications office of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2011. Officials aimed to grow the audience of their annual, and tired, message about preparing for hurricanes and other disasters by connecting it with a zombie apocalypse, like the one depicted in AMC’s The Walking Dead (which PolitiFact Georgia dutifully fact-checked). CDC officials created a tongue-in-cheek blog post from Dr. Ali Khan, assistant surgeon general and director of the CDC’s Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response. Khan wrote: ""The rise of zombies in pop culture has given credence to the idea that a zombie apocalypse could happen. In such a scenario zombies would take over entire countries, roaming city streets eating anything living that got in their way. The proliferation of this idea has led many people to wonder 'How do I prepare for a zombie apocalypse?' ""Well, we’re here to answer that question for you, and hopefully share a few tips about preparing for real emergencies too!"" Khan advised people to build emergency survival kits before a zombie outbreak that include water, non-perishable food, a battery-powered radio, tools, medications, cleaning supplies, vital documents and a first-aid kit -- supplies that are key to surviving the aftermath of a hurricane or tornado. And Khan advised families to create an emergency plan detailing where to go and who to call if zombies show up, though ""you can also implement this plan if there is a flood, earthquake or other emergency."" Reading the screed makes clear that Khan was having fun with the zombie fascination, and that this wasn’t an actual government plan to fend off walkers. The CDC, however, does offer real tips for preparing for and responding to explosions, nuclear blasts, smallpox, Anthrax, earthquakes and other hazardous situations. Zombies didn’t make the official list. Most people realized the joke. The Atlantic bemoaned the lack of meaningful advice for effective zombie-killing weapons, hot-wiring cars, figuring out the best time of day to travel, ""or really any worthwhile strategy for keeping zombies out of your house."" As a PR stunt, it was pretty effective. The CDC department expected a week’s worth of attention but it stretched over a year, leading to an elaborate graphic novella generated within the agency and a ""CDC Zombie Apocalypse Team"" T-shirt produced by the CDC Foundation that benefited disaster and health programs. It earned a spotlight in national media, including the New York Times, CNN and Fox News, where host Bill O’Reilly dubbed the campaign one of the ""dumbest things of the week."" Most CDC blog posts get between 1,000 and 3,000 hits, according to a case study of the campaign for the University of Southern California. But the zombie post crashed the server after getting tens of thousands of hits, and generated more than 4.8 million page views in the two years after its launch. A chunk of the online traffic came from the agency sharing the blog post on Twitter. Palin attacked the zombie apocalypse plan (remember, not a real how-to guide) as wasting tax dollars. But this doesn’t appear to be a story about wasted stimulus grants or $16 muffins or IRS Star Trek parodies. In this case, the CDC was using an unorthodox tactic to disseminate real information. People may argue with the method, but the campaign was designed to get people prepared for real disasters. The CDC says the zombie apocalypse campaign did not require outside contractors and did not take much time. Essentially, the project cost the hours that it took to produce it by its in-house staff. We asked for more specifics but did not hear back by our deadline. Stock images of zombies cost the team $87, but there were not many initial expenses because the project was based on social media sharing, according to the USC case study, co-authored by the CDC staffer who drafted Kahn’s original blog post. When the campaign became Internet gold, the CDC spent $20,000 on posters, postcards and copies of the graphic novella for libraries, schools and scout troops, the report says. The CDC retired its zombie attack campaign, but it remains online to accommodate public interest, a spokesman told us. Officials blogged in 2012 about ""teachable moments"" from The Walking Dead, such as keeping your gas tank half full during an emergency and keeping a first-aid kit around to quickly treat cuts induced by rooting around rusty cars in search of abandoned gasoline. For the record, the CDC says it would take a zombie apocalypse very seriously, conducting an investigation into the disease, helping to quarantine infected citizens and sending medical teams into the field. But it’s not banking on it happening. Our ruling Palin wrote on Facebook, ""As unbelievable as it sounds, your tax dollars are funding the federal government's Zombie Apocalypse Plan. I kid you not."" People who worry about the zombie apocalypse will not be comforted to hear this, but there is no plan. The CDC played off the zombie apocalypse craze in 2011 as way to pass along real information about preparing for emergencies that don't involve zombies. They wrote up a tongue-in-cheek blog post, which successfully generated plenty of attention.  So when the zombies come, you’re on your own. And Palin’s claim is False. May 28 update (2:04 p.m.): Since our fact-check first posted, our zombie friends have alerted us to some more zombie government business that we think is worth mentioning. None of it affects our rating of False. In the first case, the Washington Examiner reported on the Department of Homeland Security allowing federal government contractors to potentially be reimbursed for attending HALO Corp.'s 2012 Counter-Terrorism Summit. As part of the summit, Halo put on a ""live war game of a zombie apocalypse, complete with 40 actors in full zombie makeup,"" the Washington Examiner reported. In the second, Foreign Policy magazine found a 2011 military training document that included plans for a zombie attack. But it’s not really a ""plan."" It’s part of a training exercise, the magazine reported. ""The document is identified as a training tool used in an in-house training exercise where students learn about the basic concepts of military plans and order development through a fictional training scenario,"" Navy Capt. Pamela Kunze, a spokeswoman for U.S. Strategic Command, told CNN.

Social media meme says 75 have joined food stamp rolls for every job created under Barack Obama
","A reader recently asked us to check out a meme circulating on social media that is critical of President Barack Obama. It reads: ""Obama Fun Fact #301: For every one job created under the Obama administration, 75 people went on food stamps."" Here’s a fun fact: The numbers here are wildly inflated. A little Googling turned up what appears to be the source of this statistic: A release by the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee headlined, ""For Every Person Added to Jobs Rolls Since January 2009, 75 People Added To Food Stamp Rolls."" This release was picked up in a Nov. 2, 2012, post by the conservative Weekly Standard. When the committee released its data, it said the most recent figures were 194,000 jobs created between January 2009 and October 2012 and 14.7 million added to the food stamp rolls between January 2009 and July 2012. That would be roughly a 75-to-1 ratio -- but it’s also a snapshot in time. Since the committee wrote that, employment has increased by 4 million jobs while the number of food stamp recipients has remained about the same, making the comparison grossly out of date. In fact, late 2012 was pretty much the only point in time during Obama’s tenure where the ratio was that bad. Prior to that, job growth was negative, so the calculation wouldn’t have made any sense. Shortly after, the number of jobs (the denominator) began growing as the number of food stamps (the numerator) stagnated, making the ratio fall consistently over time. So what is the correct number? The standard way of counting how many jobs were created during a specific time span is to use seasonally adjusted data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ payroll survey for total non-farm employment. The one tricky part is to determine when to start the clock for Obama. We chose three possible points: January 2009, when Obama was sworn in; July 2009, when the recovery from the last recession officially began; and February 2010, the post-recession low point in employment. We compared each of these dates to the most recent month available, April 2014. Regardless of the time frame, Obama has overseen a net increase in jobs, though the amount of the increase varies. From January 2009-April 2014, the number of jobs increased by 4,276,000. From July 2009-April 2014, the number of jobs increased by 7,635,000. And from February 2010-April 2014, the number of jobs increased by 8,597,000. Now let’s look at the statistics for food stamps, a program now known officially as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The average monthly number of beneficiaries for fiscal year 2009 -- which was split between the tenure of Presidents George W. Bush and Obama -- was 33,490,000. So far in fiscal year 2014, the average is 46,788,311. That’s an increase of 13,298,000 people. Now, looking at as the meme does -- as a ratio -- the number of food stamp beneficiaries was between 1.5 and 3.1 times higher than the number of new jobs. That’s not the type of statistic Obama is apt to broadcast on the hustings, but it’s also far smaller than the 75-to-1 ratio claimed in the Facebook post. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, said she can’t think of any other way to make the calculation that would make the meme’s math work. ""I can't see a way that this is anything other than false,"" she said. Anyone continuing to circulate this meme is hereby warned that it is no longer accurate. Our ruling The meme claims that ""for every one job created under the Obama administration, 75 people went on food stamps."" The actual ratio is far smaller -- between 1.5-to-1 and 3.1-to-1. That doesn’t put the administration’s economic record in a very flattering light, but the ratio is far lower than the meme suggests. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097171380>],/factchecks/2014/may/28/facebook-posts/social-media-meme-says-75-have-joined-food-stamp-r/

No evidence that choice students outperform public school students, Mary Burke says
","One way Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke contrasts herself with Gov. Scott Walker is with the state's school voucher program, which uses public money to pay for lower-income children to attend private schools. With his 2013-’15 state budget, Walker expanded the voucher program, also known as school choice, by opening it to a limited number of students outside of Milwaukee and Racine. Burke, a Madison School Board member, opposes the expansion. Speaking to the Milwaukee Rotary Club on May 6, 2014, she elaborated on why, saying: ""What I want to see is initiatives and programs that are actually based on research and success that’s going to improve education, instead of saying that, well, our answer is just to roll out a voucher program that actually has no research that shows that it’s going to improve student learning."" This debate has been engaged many times before. So let's see what we know about research into the performance of public vs. voucher school students. Vouchers and their expansion Vouchers in Wisconsin date to 1989, when Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson and a Democratic-majority Legislature created the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, the nation's first urban school voucher program of its kind in the country. Under the original law, the number of vouchers was limited to 1 percent of the enrollment in Milwaukee Public Schools. And only non-sectarian private schools in the city were eligible to take choice students. Choice started with about 300 students in the 1990-’91 school year. The program has since been expanded several times -- more than 25,000 students now participate -- with the two most recent expansions occurring under Walker: Expansion of school vouchers in Wisconsin 1995: Religious schools can participate; voucher limit raised to 15 percent of Milwaukee Public Schools enrollment 2005: Voucher limit raised to 22,500 MPS students 2011: Voucher limit eliminated; income eligibility raised; private schools outside Milwaukee can accept Milwaukee choice students; Racine-area students and schools are made eligible 2013: On limited basis, vouchers available to students outside of Milwaukee and Racine   Now let’s look at data on the performance of public vs voucher students. Test scores and Arkansas research In assessing Burke’s claim, it’s important to note there are limited ways to compare the performance of voucher vs public school students. Wisconsin does not require voucher schools to publicly disclose measures such as retention rates, graduation rates or college-entrance exam scores. As we reported in an April 2013 article on competing claims about voucher schools, and as we found in doing additional research for this article, there are two primary measures of vouchers in Wisconsin: 1. Annual statewide test scores reported in 2011 through 2014; and 2. A study by researchers based at the University of Arkansas that tracked the test scores of particular choice and Milwaukee Public Schools students over five years, ending in 2011. 1. Here’s how public and voucher students compared on statewide test scores: 2011: In first direct comparison involving statewide tests, students in Milwaukee Public Schools performed better than or about the same as voucher students in reading and math 2012 and 2013: Students attending public schools were more proficient, as a group, than their private school-choice counterparts in Milwaukee and Racine in reading and math 2014: On average, MPS students performed higher than Milwaukee choice students in reading and math. Racine public school students also scored higher on math and reading proficiency than Racine voucher students. An April 2014 report from the Public Policy Forum, a nonpartisan research group in Milwaukee, shows that from 2010-’11 through 2012-’13, Milwaukee Public Schools students outperformed voucher students at every grade level (third through 10th grades) on the statewide reading and math tests. So, overall, four years worth of publicly available, annual state test scores give a clear edge to public school students over voucher students. 2. Arkansas research The Arkansas research, meanwhile, took a different approach. Its ""longitudinal"" study tracked representative samples of 2,727 Milwaukee choice students and 2,727 Milwaukee Public Schools for five years, from the 2006-’07 through 2010-’11 school years. Key findings: Growth in math achievement was similar in all years, while voucher students made gains in reading in 2010-'11 that were higher than students in the Milwaukee Public Schools sample. Milwaukee students enrolling in a private high school in the choice program ""increases the likelihood of a student graduating from high school, enrolling in a four-year college and persisting in college by 4 to 7 percentage points."" It’s important to note that the reading advantage was for just one year, and the Arkansas researchers cautioned that some evidence suggested it was due to the introduction of a new state testing requirement for private choice schools. University of Arkansas education reform professor Patrick Wolf told us there's no way to know whether the reading improvement was due to the voucher schools themselves or other factors, such as teachers preparing their students more for the annual test because 2011 was the first year that voucher schools had to publicly disclose their test scores. On the high school finding, a majority of students who were enrolled in private choice schools in the ninth grade were no longer in a choice school by the time they reached 12th grade. The results, therefore, should be interpreted as the effect of ""exposure"" to choice schools rather than long-term persistence in that sector, the Arkansas study found. Wolf said that while there is no overall evidence that voucher schools improved learning in Milwaukee, for Burke to say there is no evidence ""is a bit of a stretch,"" given what the Arkansas research found. Before we close, we’ll note two other studies that indicate voucher schools have an indirect impact on student learning. One study was done in 2003 by an economics professor then at Harvard University and one was done in 2008 by an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The studies said competition from voucher schools were linked with improved performance of students in Milwaukee Public Schools. For example, the 2003 study found that test scores in math, science, social studies, language and reading increased more in MPS schools where at least two-thirds of students were eligible for vouchers. Our rating Burke said the Wisconsin voucher program ""has no research that shows that it’s going to improve student learning."" Public school students consistently outperformed voucher students on statewide test scores from 2011 to 2014. The one study held up by choice advocates shows only limited instances in which voucher students performed better, and the study couldn't determine whether the voucher schools themselves or other factors were the reason. Burke goes too far in saying there is no evidence that vouchers improve student learning, but the evidence is thin. We rate her statement Mostly True.
