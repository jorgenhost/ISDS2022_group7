Dem challenger to GOP U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin says Duffy voted twice to end Medicare
","
How preoccupied were Wisconsin political types with the state's gubernatorial recall election?

On June 6, 2012, the day after the vote, Democrat Pat Kreitlow used Republican Gov. Scott Walker's victory to whack first-term U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis.

Kreitlow, a former state senator and TV anchor, is seeking to oust the former district attorney and MTV reality show star in the November 2012 election.

Here's the first paragraph of a two-paragraph news release that Kreitlow issued about Walker's defeat of Democratic Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett:

""Governor Walker's margin of victory shows that there are still well over a million Wisconsin residents who believe our leaders should represent regular Wisconsinites and not corporate special interests. Unfortunately, Congressman Sean Duffy does not abide by this belief and voted twice to end Medicare and make seniors pay thousands more for their health care, all to give more tax breaks to multimillionaires and corporations who ship our jobs overseas.""

Hmmm. Duffy, who represents a northwestern Wisconsin district, voted twice to end Medicare, the federal program that pays the health care bills for Americans over age 65?

Deja vu

Where have we heard before that Republicans voted end Medicare?

Oh, yeah. That was PolitiFact National's Lie of the Year for 2011.   

Wisconsin Democrats were well represented among those making end-Medicare-related claims, with former state representative Sandy Pasch  and state legislative candidate Shelly Moore each earning a Pants on Fire.

PolitiFact National pointed out that the target of the Democrats' attacks -- a budget plan advanced by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- would not affect people currently in Medicare, or even people 55 to 65 who would join the program in the next 10 years.

Our colleagues also noted that in 2011, the University of Pennsylvania-based FactCheck.org concluded that Medicare would remain an entitlement, though more costly to future beneficiaries. And The Washington Post’s Fact Checker said that while there’s ""a worthwhile debate"" about whether Ryan’s proposal should be adopted, ""it is not true to claim Republicans are trying to ‘kill’ Medicare.""

That makes three fact checkers knocking down the claim that Republicans voted to end Medicare.

Nevertheless, now comes Kreitlow.

Kreitlow's case

The evidence to back his claim are Duffy's votes in April 2011 and March 2012 for Ryan's budget proposals, said Kreitlow campaign manager Jocelyn Steinberg. The proposals would replace Medicare with a voucher, she claimed.

Steinberg cited statements in eight news or opinion articles, including some that vehemently disagreed with PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year selection.

Among them:

Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman claimed Ryan's 2011 plan ""ends Medicare and leaves seniors with a voucher and no guarantee they can afford health care costs that would double."" The Economist magazine opined that the plan ""ends the guarantee that all American seniors will have health insurance."" And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said ""most elderly people would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system.""

There's no question Ryan's 2011 and 2012 budgets, neither of which were adopted, would have dramatically changed Medicare; indeed PolitiFact National rated as Mostly True a claim that his plan would privatize Medicare.

As our colleagues noted in that item:

""Right now, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care beneficiaries receive. Medicare beneficiaries pay premiums for some types of coverage, and younger workers contribute payroll taxes. Ryan’s plan leaves Medicare as is for people 55 and older. In 2022, though, new beneficiaries would be insured by private insurance companies rather than the federal government,  although they would receive ""premium support"" -- financial assistance from the government for buying insurance. People who need more health care would get a little more money.""

The point is, Medicare would change -- significantly -- under the proposals Duffy supported. But it would still exist.

Asked to respond to Kreitlow's claim, Duffy campaign manager Justin Richards simply noted PolitiFact National's Lie of the Year selection.

Our rating

Kreitlow said Duffy ""voted twice to end Medicare."" But under the proposals Duffy voted for, a revamped Medicare would remain.

At this stage, Kreitlow’s statement is false and ridiculous -- Pants on Fire.","[('\nWisPolitics.com, Pat Kreitlow campaign news release, June 6, 2012\n\nInterview and email interview, Pat Kreitlow campaign manager Jocelyn Steinberg, June 14, 2012\n\nEmail interview, Rep.

Vincent Prieto claims Chris Christie’s proposed budget is largest spending plan in state history
","
Gov. Chris Christie touts himself as a chief executive who tightened Trenton’s purse strings, squeezing out excess spending while paring down state government.

But a Democratic state legislator claims the Republican governor’s proposed budget makes history for two costly reasons.

""This is the biggest spending budget in the history of the state of New Jersey. It is the largest in the nation at this point in time, that just was written by the governors of the nation,"" Assembly Budget Committee Chairman Vincent Prieto (D-Hudson) said during an interview on My9 News' ""New Jersey Now"" that aired June 17.

Those are two big claims, both of which are short on facts.

The budget proposal that Christie outlined in February for the upcoming fiscal year called for nearly $32.15 billion in state spending. The Senate and Assembly are scheduled to vote on a Democratic budget proposal on Monday.

Though Christie’s proposal is one of the largest budget plans in New Jersey’s history, former Gov. Jon Corzine proposed more costly budgets.

Corzine’s fiscal 2008 budget proposed $33.3 billion in spending for the year, the most in state history. Final state spending that year ended slightly higher, at $33.61 billion, according to state Treasury Department reports.

Corzine proposed a $32.97 billion spending plan for fiscal 2009, but the state ultimately spent less than that, with the final tab at $30.8 billion, excluding federal stimulus aid.

But comparing apples to apples -- budget proposals to budget proposals -- the governor introduced the third largest spending plan in state history.

Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, said Prieto was referring to a larger measurement of spending that includes federal money, as well as spending from funds like the Transportation Trust Fund. By that measure, Christie’s proposal includes more spending than previous budget plans.

The assemblyman’s ""point is accurate,"" said Hester.

But Prieto does not make that distinction during the interview, which focused on whether the state can afford a tax cut considering lower-than-expected state revenues.

Andy Pratt, a spokesman for the state Treasury Department, said Prieto is including expenditures that are listed as off-budget and said the budget has never been referred to in this way. ""Only if you are looking for a way to make some kind of political point would you do it another way,"" he said.

Prieto also said Christie’s proposal is the largest in the nation. That’s not true.

Hester said Prieto meant to refer to the percentage increase in state spending, not the broader measurement of spending, between Christie’s proposed budget and the current budget.

The National Governors Association and the National Association of State Budget Officers released a report in June that tracks spending from states’ general funds only. The report found Christie’s budget proposal for fiscal 2013 increases spending by 7.2 percent over fiscal 2012.

The percentage increase in New Jersey’s spending is larger than any other state, according to data in the report. California is proposing the next largest increase at 7 percent.

So by that measure, Christie is proposing the largest spending increase in the nation, but Prieto is wrong to characterize the governor’s budget as ""the largest in the nation.""

The budgets for California, New York, Texas and Massachusetts all propose to spend more in the upcoming fiscal year than New Jersey, according to data in the report.

Our ruling

In a discussion about whether New Jersey can afford a tax cut considering lower-than-expected state revenues, Prieto said Christie’s proposed budget is ""the biggest spending budget in the history of the state of New Jersey. It is the largest in the nation at this point in time.""

The governor’s fiscal 2013 budget calls for $32.15 billion in state spending. That’s the third largest -- not the largest -- budget proposal in state history.

A spokesman for Prieto said the assemblyman was referring to a broader measurement of spending, which includes federal funds. But Prieto did not make that distinction.

Also, New Jersey’s budget is not the largest in the nation.

We rate this claim False.

"['Deficit', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'Gerry Connolly']","
Rep. Gerry Connolly says Reagan raised taxes during five years of presidency
","
U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-11th, recently invoked the name of Ronald Reagan to drum up support for raising taxes for a new stimulus program.

During a June 5 floor speech, Connolly lamented the refusal of House Republican leaders to allow the American Jobs Act to come up for a vote. The bill, proposed by President Barack Obama, calls for $447 billion over 10 years to pay for infrastructure and school improvements, new job training programs, unemployment insurance, and temporary tax cuts for working families and small businesses.

The stimulus would be funded by levying taxes on corporations and people earning more than $1 million a year.

Connolly said the House, in considering the legislation, should ask, ""What would Ronald Reagan do?""

""Many Republicans decried the use of additional revenue to help offset any increase in national debt,"" Connolly said. ""Apparently, they forgot that when faced with rising deficits, Ronald Reagan looked to revenue increases, broadening the tax base, closing loopholes and raising taxes. Yes, he raised taxes in 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987.""

Did the Gipper really raise taxes during five years of his presidency? We checked.

Let’s start by noting that if you recall Reagan as tax cutter, your memory is good. Reagan campaigned in 1980 on reducing taxes. During his administration, the top income tax rate decreased from 70 percent in 1981 to 28 percent in 1986.

But to combat a rising deficit and debt burden, Reagan also approved increased taxes.

In 1982, The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act raised taxes by $37.5 billion per year, and the Highway Revenue Act raised the gasoline tax by $3.3 billion.

In 1983, Reagan signed off on legislation to raise payroll taxes and tax Social Security benefits for some higher earners.

In 1984, the Deficit Reduction Act included increases in taxes on estates and distilled spirits and ended some business tax breaks, to the tune of $18 billion per year.

In 1985, Reagan signed legislation making permanent a 16-cent federal excise tax on a pack of cigarettes, then worth about $2.4 billion a year.

In 1986, the Tax Reform Act lowered the top income tax bracket from 50 percent to 28 percent. To pay for the reductions, however, the legislation closed a number of tax loopholes.

In 1987, Reagan signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act that extended the telephone excise tax and eliminated a real estate tax deduction loophole.

So it’s accurate to say Reagan increased levies during five years of his administration, but there’s a caveat: The overall tax burden on businesses and individuals went down during his presidency.

We examined data from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center that computes the nation’s tax revenues as a percentage of its Gross Domestic Product -- the total of all goods and services produced.

When Reagan took office in 1981, federal taxes were 19.6 percent of GDP, the highest level since World War II. That figure dropped to 17.3 percent during his first term and rose to 18.2 percent at the end of his second term.

For comparison, federal tax revenues for this fiscal year are estimated at 15.8 percent of GDP.

Reagan’s efforts to cut top income tax rates at the same time he was increasing defense spending created strain, and the federal debt rose from $994 billion at the start of his first term to almost $2.9 trillion at the end. As a result, Reagan was willing to accept and sometimes promote proposals that would close loopholes and create a broader tax base, according to C. Eugene Steuerle, who organized the Treasury Department's 1984-86 tax reform effort and is now a fellow at the Urban Institute and Tax Policy Center.

This April, President Barack Obama said Reagan ""understood repeatedly that when the deficit started to get out of control, that for him to make a deal, he would have to propose both spending cuts and tax increases."" PolitiFact National rated the claim Mostly True, noting that Reagan did not repeatedly propose increases but agreed to tax hikes put forth by Congress.

Our ruling

Connolly said Reagan, as president ""raised taxes"" in 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987.  Reagan did, in fact, sign off on at least one tax increase during each of those years.

Some of the increases were modest in scope. And it’s important to note that overall U.S. taxes, when measured as a portion of the nation’s GDP, went down during Reagan’s presidency.

But there’s no doubt that Reagan was willing to cut budget deals that included raising revenues. We rate Connolly’s statement True.","[('\nRep.

Pro-transportation group says tax foe backs hike
","
The folks leading the charge in support of a regionwide penny-per-dollar sales tax for transportation projects have raised a question to critics who don’t like the plan:

So what’s your solution?

A press release on that question brought on a verbal dispute we felt was worthy of a fact-check as both sides search for any weakness in the opponent’s position, showing what a tightly contested campaign this has become.

Sales tax supporters thought they found the answer to their question when they read quotes attributed to Debbie Dooley, a prominent Georgia tea party activist who is among the most vocal opponents of the plan.

""Tea Party leader wants gas taxes raised,"" read the headline to a press release written by Citizens for Transportation Mobility, an advocacy group in favor of the referendum. ""Dooley publicly supports a never-ending tax with less public accountability.""

Dooley countered that the group wasn’t telling the whole story about her position on gas taxes.

""We have repeatedly said until elected officials show us they are responsible with our tax dollars, they’re not getting a dime,"" Dooley told PolitiFact Georgia.

In 2010, the Georgia Legislature voted to allow residents to vote by referendum on whether to increase their sales tax rates to pay for transportation projects. The Legislature divided the state into 12 regions to give residents choices of potential transportation projects that may best help their region, if they choose to do so. In a 10-county region that encompasses the city of Atlanta, its largest counties and other suburbs, the tax could fund 157 transportation projects if the referendum passes. The vote is scheduled for July 31.

Some referendum opponents have a list as long as Buford Highway that outlines their objections to the plan. One reason they’ve said they don’t want it is they’re not in favor of an additional tax across an entire region. They don’t trust elected officials to spend the money as planned.

Dooley outlined those concerns and others at a June 12 forum organized by the Civic League for Regional Atlanta.

""We don’t feel like they’ve been fiscally responsible with the tax dollars they’ve been given,"" Dooley said of elected officials in her opening remarks.

Dooley said she and others have presented some ideas to referendum supporters, but were rebuffed. She then talked about the gas tax.

""We support increasing the gas tax, which has not been done since 1991,"" Dooley said at the forum, Citizens for Transportation Mobility wrote in the press release.

Georgia’s excise gas tax is currently 7.5 cents a gallon, the second lowest in the country. (Excise taxes are special taxes on the purchase of items such as gasoline, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. Excise taxes are usually fixed amounts per item, rather than percentages of the price.) It has not changed since 1971, which Dooley actually said at the forum.

Citizens for Transportation Mobility criticized Dooley’s idea.

""We have been waiting on the opposition to come up with their ‘Plan B’ and we now see that they want to build more toll roads, raise gas taxes and take away the power of citizens to vote on a specific project list,"" said Che Watkins, campaign manager for Citizens for Transportation Mobility. ""We are frankly shocked that a tea party leader would advocate for higher permanent taxes with less public accountability.""

Dooley actually said more than what was mentioned in the press release, a video of the meeting showed.

""One of the funding mechanisms we would look at once the gas prices came down to a manageable level is to increase the gas tax,"" she said.

Citizens for Transportation Mobility spokeswoman Saba Long defended the organization’s position, noting that Dooley didn’t say how much lower gas prices must be in order for her to support increasing the gas tax.

""She’s trying to have it both ways,"" Long said.

Dooley told PolitiFact Georgia gas prices must be $2 a gallon or less before she would consider supporting an increase to excise gas taxes.

Dooley did float the idea of raising the gas tax. But she said in the same sentence that gas prices must come down first. She also stated her distrust of elected officials with tax dollars. Neither was included in the press release.

The Citizens for Transportation Mobility statement was based on an accurate comment by Dooley, but it leaves out some important context.

"['Rhode Island', 'Legal Issues', 'Pop Culture', 'Technology', 'Christopher Blazejewski']","
State Rep. Blazejewski says Rhode Island law made white lies misdemeanors if transmitted on the Internet.
","
Are you a 42-year-old grizzled ogre with no money and chronic halitosis searching for an online date by claiming to be 32, rich and extraordinarily handsome?

Good news! Thanks to a new law, you don't risk going to jail for lying through your few remaining teeth.

But previously,  you could have faced misdemeanor charges in Rhode Island, if you believe state Rep. Christopher Blazejewski, a Providence Democrat. On June 12, he told the Rhode Island House that it was illegal to transmit a lie on the Internet, on radio, on TV, or over the phone about anything.

""Under current law, if you go on a dating website and you say you're 32 and you're actually 42, you've committed a misdemeanor under our current law. Any transmission of false information makes you a criminal under Rhode Island state law,"" he said during the final day of the session.

He was pushing for House Bill 7389 to change the law that makes all electronic lying illegal. He wanted to keep the section that made it a felony if you lie to get payment from a claim, but delete the paragraph that made it a misdemeanor to engage in all other types of lying.

To say PolitiFact Rhode Island was intrigued would be an understatement.

Could many of the Pants-On-Fire politicians and pundits we've exposed during the past two years have faced a fine of up to $500, and up to a year in jail?

Well, if it was true then, it isn't now. The bill passed the House and Senate, Governor Chafee signed it on June 20, and the legislation took effect immediately. In Rhode Island, telling white lies on the Internet is now officially legal.

But the question persists: Was Blazejewski correct at the time he made the statement?

The statute involved is Section 11-52-7 of the Rhode Island General Laws. Paragraph (a), which is still in effect, makes it a felony to transmit false data ""for the purpose of submitting a claim for payment.""

Paragraph (b) dealt with electronic lying for any other purpose. It said, ""Whoever intentionally or knowingly: (1) makes a transmission of false data; or (2) makes, presents or uses or causes to be made, presented or used any data for any other purpose with knowledge of its falsity, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . ""

During a three-minute hearing on the bill on March 13, the lone witness, Steven Brown of the Rhode Island Affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union, called for its repeal because ""any other purpose"" is overly broad and a violation of free speech.

""Make sure that none of us get charged with a crime for lying on a dating site, telling our spouse that we're stuck in a meeting when we're somewhere else, or a variety of other situations that many of us may have encountered over the years,"" he urged the legislators.

At the Rhode Island attorney general's office, spokeswoman Amy Kempe consulted with Ronald Gendron, chief of the white collar crime and public corruption unit. (Note: We talked with her before Governor Chafee signed the bill.)

""On the surface, someone could take that portion of the statute literally"" and prosecute for any lie, she said. But ""that was neither the intent nor is it the application of the statute.""

Laws need to be interpreted in context, and this statute, as a whole, ""was clearly designed to accommodate a fraud for money,"" said Kempe.

Paragraph (a) made it a felony to transmit a lie ""for the purpose of submitting a claim for payment,"" such as for an insurance loss. Paragraph (b), in its reference to ""any other purpose,"" really only applies to other types of deception where financial gain is involved, she said.

Finally, Jared Goldstein, a law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law, said the plain language of the law did ""indeed appear to make it a crime to knowingly or intentionally send any false information over the Internet, without any limitation on the context or subject matter. If read literally, the language would seem to cover giving false information on a dating site. Or lying to a friend in an e-mail message. Or maybe even clicking 'Like' for a friend's photo that you don't really like.""

""If the provision is read in that literal way,"" he said, ""it would almost certainly be unconstitutionally overbroad because it would prohibit a huge amount of Constitutionally-protected speech. Even if it is not read that way, but construed narrowly to cover only false information that can constitutionally be prohibited, the law may still be unconstitutionally vague, because it doesn't clearly tell the public what is prohibited.""

Our ruling

Rep. Christopher Blazejewski said that ""Under current law, if you go on a dating website and you say you're 32 and you're actually 42, you've committed a misdemeanor.""

That's indeed what the law said at the time. (It has since been changed.)

Whether you risked prosecution if you told such a lie would have been another matter entirely. The attorney general's office said the statute was only meant to apply to lies designed to garner financial gain. And the law professor we checked with says it was such a broad, vague limit on free speech, it was probably unconstitutional.

Nonetheless, the PolitiFact judges rate Blazejewski's claim as True.

Tommy Thompson says federal health care reforms are a ‘government takeover of health care’
","
Republican Tommy Thompson uses a farm field as a backdrop and a stop sign as a prop in a new television ad for his U.S. Senate campaign.

The former governor rattles off a list of practices that he would ""stop"" if voters send him to Washington in November 2012: deficits, tax hikes,over-regulation of business.

""And I’ll stop the government takeover of health care by repealing ‘Obamacare,’ "" he concludes.

Thompson is one of four candidates seeking the GOP nomination for the seat held by retiring U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl (D-Wis.). We asked Thompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir to explain the last item, about which plenty has been written.

He provided this explanation.

""The statement is ‘I’ll stop the government takeover of health care,’"" Nemoir wrote in an email.

But that skips the end of the sentence, which is the key: Thompson says he’ll stop the takeover ""by repealing ‘Obamacare.’ "" Did the federal health reforms -- part of a key case awaiting a U.S. Supreme Court ruling -- amount to ""the government takeover of health care.""

Seems like we’ve been down this road a few times.

Indeed, calling the 2010 health care reform bill a ""government takeover of health care"" was deemed the 2010 ""Lie of the Year"" by PolitiFact National. Readers also chose it as that year's most significant falsehood. It concluded that the statement ""is simply not true.""

Here are some details from that item:

• Employers will continue to provide health insurance to the majority of Americans through private insurance companies.
   
• Contrary to the claim, more people will get private health coverage. The law sets up ""exchanges"" where private insurers will compete to provide coverage to people who don't have it.
   
• Under the law, the government will not seize control of hospitals or nationalize doctors.
   
• The law does not include the public option, a government-run insurance plan that would have competed with private insurers.   

• The law gives tax credits to people who have difficulty affording insurance, so they can buy their coverage from private providers on the exchange. But here too, the approach relies on a free market with regulations, not socialized medicine.
   
PolitiFact National concluded: ""PolitiFact reporters have studied the 906-page bill and interviewed independent health care experts. We have concluded it is inaccurate to call the plan a government takeover because it relies largely on the existing system of health coverage provided by employers.""

For his part, Nemoir said the law is ""a mandated program reducing consumer health care choice coupled with massive increases in both cost and regulation of an industry impacting virtually all Americans, and currently responsible for nearly 20 percent of our GDP, seemingly fits the formally undefined, ‘government takeover.’""

Nemoir also said Thompson, who served as U.S. Health and Human Services secretary under President George W. Bush, ""has demonstrated leadership on tough issues throughout his career and is uniquely positioned as a health care expert.""

That may be true, but his resume is not at issue in the ""government takeover"" claim.

Finally, Thompson suggests he would repeal the health care law by himself. Of course, there are 99 other senators, and the House of Representatives, and the president, who would have a say in it. But we think most would recognize that as Thompson simply stating his position, not claiming he could do it unilaterally.

Our conclusion

Thompson says in a TV ad that federal health reforms amount to ""the government takeover of health care."" It’s not a government takeover. We’ve said numerous times that characterizing the law in this way is a distortion of the facts -- and the 2010 Lie of the Year.

Chris Christie claims New Jersey’s job growth in May represents 25 percent of the net new jobs nationwide
","
For those Democrats questioning whether to cut taxes, Gov. Chris Christie has a statistic to prove his ""Jersey Comeback"" is real: the Garden State in May created one out of every four net new jobs in the nation.

Christie offered that statistic during a June 14 press conference as one of the ""real facts"" Democrats should address.

""Fact is, it is time for a tax cut in this state,"" said Christie, according to a video posted June 15 on YouTube. ""It is long overdue for a tax cut in this state, and I hope that today they stop with the make-believe and start addressing the real facts, which are that New Jersey is the single biggest job producer last month of any state in the country -- 25 percent of all the jobs created in the country right here.""

But PolitiFact New Jersey found that Christie was making an invalid comparison of federal labor statistics.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics announced June 1 that the nation had seen a net increase of 69,000 nonfarm jobs in May, accounting for both job gains and losses. State officials said June 14 that New Jersey saw an over-the-month increase in May of 17,600 nonfarm jobs. Both figures are preliminary and seasonally adjusted.

Christie’s mistake was claiming that the 17,600 jobs in New Jersey were part of that 69,000 for the nation. 

The most valid comparison would be to consider New Jersey’s 17,600 jobs as a share of the job gains across the country in May, according to Doug Hall, director of the Economic Analysis and Research Network at the Washington, DC-based Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank.

In May, a total of 184,500 jobs were created in 27 states and Washington, D.C. Of that amount, New Jersey’s growth represents about 9.5 percent.

Those statistics, which were released by the bureau the day after Christie’s press conference, also show that California and Ohio saw greater job gains in May than New Jersey. So, Christie’s wrong to say ""New Jersey is the single biggest job producer last month of any state.""

Brian Murray, a spokesman with the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, argued that at the time of the governor’s statement, Christie only had ""the net national gain of 69,000 jobs against which to compare the state numbers.""

""I understand your point that the comparison made is not recommended by the BLS,"" Murray said in an e-mail. ""But I think you should consider that it was not until June 15, a day after the Governor made his remarks, that the public and Governor’s Office could have seen the full BLS numbers on national figures and other states like California.""

Christie may not have had the additional labor statistics, but that doesn’t change the fact that he made a flawed comparison with the publicly available figures at his disposal.

Our ruling

At his June 14 press conference, Christie claimed New Jersey’s over-the-month increase of 17,600 jobs in May represented ""25 percent of all the jobs created in the country.""

The governor was comparing the state’s job growth to the national estimate of 69,000 net jobs created. But according to the bureau, state estimates and the national estimate are developed separately, making it wrong to compare the two.

We rate the statement False.

Lamar Alexander says three Tennessee cities among worst five in nation for asthma
","
Even as coal advocates applied political pressure on Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, the state’s senior senator stood his ground in refusing to join the fight to kill the Environmental Protection Agency’s planned implementation of clean air rules.

Commercials by the group American Commitment, a conservative group recently focusing on boosting the coal industry,  branded him an ally of what it calls a ""war on coal"" by President Obama. The group asked people to call and write Alexander to make him switch his stance and vote for a resolution by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, to disapprove the EPA's new Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for power plants.

Alexander responded by saying he was ""standing up for Tennessee."" He cited the pollution created from ""dirty air"" blowing into Tennessee from other states causing smog in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and even pointed out that more Tennesseans work for companies that make pollution-control equipment required under the rule than work mining coal.

At a Congressional field hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reforms Committee in Murfreesboro, Alexander also claimed that one result of  ""dirty air"" is that, in Tennessee, ""three of our cities are among the top five worst cities in the U.S. for asthma.""

We decided to see if that was indeed true.

A quick primer on asthma from the Mayo Clinic: It is ""a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.""

The Mayo Clinic says, ""It isn't clear why some people get asthma and others don't, but it's probably due to a combination of environmental and genetic (inherited) factors.""

Alexander’s office said he was referring to the 2012 Asthma Capitals rankings released in May by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA). The AAFA  describes itself as a non-profit founded in 1953 that ""is the leading patient organization for people with asthma and allergies, and the oldest asthma and allergy patient group in the world.""

Sure enough, the rankings have Memphis at No. 1, Knoxville at No. 3 and Chattanooga at No. 5, with New Haven, Conn., at No. 2 and Pittsburgh, Pa., at No. 4. And it was apparently no fluke -- the 2011 rankings had those Tennessee cities ranked Nos. 2-4, though Knoxville was ahead of Memphis last year.

Nashville, it’s worth noting, ranked No. 26 this year after coming in at No. 10 in 2011.

It’s important to note that the AAFA emphasizes the rankings are an attempt to measure which cities ""are more challenging places to live"" for asthma sufferers, not necessarily just a listing of places with the highest prevalence of people suffering with asthma. The report also notes that air pollution is not the only factor it considers, with a total of 12 data sets that include the number of high-ozone days, pollen counts, medication utilization, poverty rates and public smoking laws.

Our ruling

Alexander wasn’t saying dirty air was the only reason Tennessee cities rank high on a list showing the most challenging cities in the country for asthma, just that the nation’s 17th-largest state placed three of its cities in the top five of those rankings.

We rate that statement True.","[('\nSen.

U.S. Rep. David Cicilline says women earn only 77 percent of what men earn in the same job
","
Some ""facts"" are repeated so often they become accepted wisdom. One of them, involving the gap between pay for women and men, was offered up by U.S. Rep. David Cicilline in a news release supporting the Paycheck Fairness Act, which failed a test vote in the House on June 5.

""Nearly a century since suffrage was achieved, women continue to lag behind men in terms of compensation in the workplace,"" Cicilline said. ""It is unacceptable that women continue to earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position. In many families, women have grown increasingly responsible for household income, and we must work to ensure that their pay keeps pace with their participation in the job market.""

The 77-cent figure has been repeated a lot by politicians and news organizations. President Obama has cited it. We saw it in a Cicilline fundraising letter after the GOP blocked the paycheck bill.

It was the subject of an NBC ""Meet The Press"" exchange in which liberal commentator Rachel Maddow quoted the figure and Republican political strategist Alex Castellanos said the statistic was misleading.

""For example, men work an average of 44 hours a week. Women work 41 hours a week. Men go into professions like engineering, science and math that earn more. Women want more flexibility,"" Castellano said amid a lot of overtalk.

If the wage difference were so great, said Castellano, ""every greedy businessman in America would hire only women, save 25 percent and be hugely profitable.""

An issue of discrimination

The underlying issue here is discrimination and the question is whether the pay is truly different for men and women doing the same job.

Because Cicilline said women earned only 77 cents for every dollar that men earned ""in the same position,"" we decided to focus on his statement.

When we asked Cicilline's office about the congressman's comment, spokesman Richard Luchette sent us to the usual source: a 2011 Census report showing the 77-percent level of female earnings to male earnings from 1960 to 2010. The data, in Figure 12 of the report, apply to full-time, year-round workers more than 14 years old. (The 77-percent number has been increasingly slowly, up from 60 percent during the 1960s and 1970s.)

But that's not a job-by-job comparison.

Luchette said Cicilline's statement is accurate because when he referred to ""in the same position,"" the congressman meant ""to refer to men and women who were in the same position in the labor force [full-time, year-round employees].""

We believe that when someone says they are paid less ""in the same position,"" most people would understand that to be a job-by-job comparison. That's the standard we will use in this fact check.

There are different ways to measure gender differences and each has its drawbacks. For example, the census looked at annual salary, but that includes bonuses and other compensation that are more likely to boost the pay of people in higher-paying brackets. It also includes self-employed but fails to account for professions such as teaching, where the full-time jobs don't last for a full year.

There are other -- and perhaps better -- ways to measure the gap. For example, among people with full-time jobs, men were more likely to work longer hours than women, which would make their annual income look larger than women's.

If you look at weekly pay among full-time workers, women age 16 and older are paid 81 cents for every dollar men earned in 2010, according to Table 1 of a July 2011 report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

If you look at hourly pay for all workers (Table 9), women earned 86 cents for every dollar men earned that year.

The amount rose to 95 cents if you looked at women who had never married, suggesting that marriage may be a factor. The rate was 97 cents among female college graduates, compared to male college graduates.

Still, that's a gap.

Perhaps the most revealing part of the report is Table 5, which looks at weekly earnings by the number of hours men and women work.

Overall, women age 16 and older earned 75 cents in 2010 for every dollar men earned. But that hides some surprising numbers.

If you look at part-time work (less than 35 hours), women earned $1.04 cents for every dollar men earned. Women who worked 35 to 39 hours earned nearly $1.13 cents for each dollar earned by their male counterparts. But as soon as the number of hours rose to 40 hours, women's earnings dropped to about 87 cents per dollar.

By the job

But that's still not the type of job-by-job comparison we believe Cicilline was talking about.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics tried to do that, too. Table 2 of the report compared the weekly earnings for men and women -- all employed full time -- for 501 occupations.

However, for nearly 8 out of 10 of those jobs, the analysts didn't have enough data on male workers or female workers to make a reliable comparison.

Among the 111 categories for which a comparison was possible, women in 45 jobs were paid less than 80 cents on the dollar and women in 35 positions were paid 80 to 90 cents for every dollar paid to men doing same task.

Only in 31 of the categories did women earn at least 90 cents for every dollar that the men earned. (Women were paid more in only four jobs. Pay rates for women were $1.05 for every dollar earned by men among people who worked as stock clerks and order fillers. The rates were $1.10 among female bill and account collectors, $1.12 for food preparation and serving workers, and $1.05 among social service counselors.)

Even in professions where women have predominated, men made more, according to the report. Female elementary and middle school teachers earned 91 cents on the dollar compared to men. Female registered nurses made less than 87 cents.

The Institute for Women's Policy Research has done a more-exhaustive evaluation of the database and concluded that women earned less in the most common, highest paying and lowest paying occupations. But, again, the data are limited.

Even those numbers may be overestimating the gap.

Three years ago, the U.S. Department of Labor released the results of a study by CONSAD Research Corp. that it had commissioned because, according to the preface by Charles E. James Sr., a deputy assistant secretary, ""the raw wage gap continues to be used in misleading ways to advance public policy agendas without fully explaining the reasons behind the gap.""

Once adjusted for the fact that women are more likely to work part-time (where the pay for everyone tends to be lower), leave the labor force for children or elder care, and gravitate toward ""family friendly"" occupations where compensation is more likely to be in the form of health insurance or other fringe benefits, the gap shrinks to between 93 cents and 95 cents on the dollar, the report said.

""The raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action,"" said James. ""Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers.""

The report was released in January, 2009. Obviously, that hasn't stopped the debate.

Our ruling

David Cicilline said women ""earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position.""

His spokesman said that was only a comparison among full-time, year-round workers. But we believe the average person would read his statement as a comparison of male and female workers in the same job, an indication that wage discrimination exists.

But the source of that 77-cent figure is not based on a job-by-job assessment. It's an across-the-workforce number that fails to take into a host of factors that could skew the amount.

All the data we examined showed pay gaps for women from as low as 58 cents to as high as $1.12 for every dollar earned by men.  And when you look at weekly earnings among wage and salary workers who work less than 40 hours a week, women earn more than men.

In citing the 77-cent figure, Cicilline ignores conflicting estimates suggesting that the gender gap is narrower or, perhaps, nonexistent when lifestyle choices are taken into account. He also skirts a key problem: for most occupations, there is not enough good data to make the kind of comparison he is talking about.

In other words, his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression: our definition of Mostly False.

Has Wisconsin AFSCME really lost 50 percent of its members since Gov. Scott Walker ended automatic dues?
","
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker survived a recall vote this month, prompting pundits to weigh in on what that means for public sector unions that had campaigned aggressively for his ouster. Remember, Walker is the Republican governor who pushed through a number of changes unfriendly to organized labor in the Badger State, including an end to automatic union dues deductions from public paychecks.

Here in the Beaver State, Steve Buckstein of the Cascade Policy Institute, a think tank that promotes limited government, tweeted: ""Did you know Wisconsin's AFSCME union has lost 50%+ of its members since no longer requiring membership?"" The tweet links to a June 14 online post by Buckstein called ""End Forced Unionism Now,"" where he quotes from an opinion column by syndicated writer Charles Krauthammer, also published in The Oregonian:

""Without the thumb of the state tilting the scale by coerced collection, union membership became truly voluntary. Result? Newly freed members rushed for the exits. In less than one year, AFSCME, the second largest public-sector union in Wisconsin, has lost more than 50 percent of its membership.""

The question is a simple one: Did membership in Wisconsin’s American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees drop by 50 percent since dues became optional?

Here’s a quick reminder of what happened in Wisconsin: In March 2011, Walker signed a bill that drastically changed bargaining rights for some but not all state, local and school employees. As pointed out by Krauthammer, dues are no longer taken out of paychecks automatically, curtailing the union’s money base.

According to PolitiFact Wisconsin, the law ""limits the ability of public unions to bargain collectively for anything except raises controlled for inflation. It ended bargaining over benefits, overtime and work conditions."" Unions have to recertify every year with fresh votes. And he increased employee contributions for pensions and health care.

We asked Buckstein for his sourcing; he said he relied on the Krauthammer column. Krauthammer cites no source for the information, but a quick check online shows a May 30 news article in the Wall Street Journal: ""Wisconsin Unions See Ranks Drop Ahead of Recall Vote.""

The reporters write that membership in the state’s second-largest public-sector union ""fell to 28,745 in February from 62,818 in March 2011, according to a person who has viewed AFSCME's figures."" That is indeed more than half its membership. Another story in the Wall Street Journal a few days later puts the drop at 45 percent.

The union disputed the figures then, and disputes them now to PolitiFact Oregon. However, Wisconsin State Employees Union, AFSCME Council 24, declined to give updated figures, saying that even people on the inside don’t have an accurate count. Certainly numbers are down, they say. (A spokesman for Walker said the state does not have figures.)

But what the union really objects to is the underlying premise in the syndicated column, and by association, Buckstein’s post: That premise is that union membership numbers dropped dramatically because people were given a choice between joining a union or not joining a union.

According to the original Wall Street Journal news article, some members didn’t re-up because of the financial pinch of health care and pension costs. Bargaining was so curtailed that another fact check by PolitiFact Wisconsin found four experts who agreed the law could mean the end of some public unions in Wisconsin.

Buckstein acknowledges that numbers probably went down more in Wisconsin because of the changes as a whole. But he stands by the idea that more members may opt out when deductions become optional.

Oregon is a great example, he says. A check with the Department of Administrative Services finds that 24 percent of the more than 24,000 people eligible to be represented by the state’s two biggest state government unions pay a share in lieu of member dues. In other words, they pay in, but are not members. The fair-share option may not be available to all employees, and depends on the terms of the bargaining contract. In either case, the money is deducted automatically from workers’ paychecks.

People on various sides of the political spectrum have their own theories about why there was a decrease in Wisconsin: higher premiums, limited bargaining subjects, complicated recertification votes, optional dues, all or some, or none of the above. We can’t rule on reason.

What we can rule on is that membership has gone down about 50 percent, according to news reports, since Walker implemented his changes. That decrease may or may not hold when numbers finally shake out. The tweet is accurate, but needs additional information.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'David Plouffe']","
Mitt Romney said he would veto the DREAM Act, says David Plouffe
","
Since President Barack Obama announced a new policy to suspend deportations for some young illegal immigrants, his campaign has been touting that policy and putting down his Republican rival, Mitt Romney.

Obama adviser David Plouffe answered a question on Fox News Sunday on June 17, 2012, about why Hispanics should vote for Obama.

""So, this is someone who believed that we are a nation of laws, but also a nation of immigrants, and that people who want to staff our labs and start businesses and serve their country ought to be able to do that,"" Plouffe said. ""Gov. Romney has said he would veto the DREAM Act. Gov. Romney essentially said the 11 million here ought to just go home. They ought to self deport. So, this is someone you're not going to be able to trust.""

We wanted to know if Romney specifically said he would veto the DREAM Act because we often find distortions when one campaign describes its opponent’s position.

A little background: The DREAM Act is the federal Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, a bill proposed several times over the years but never passed.

Generally speaking, it pertains to children brought to the U.S. illegally by parents or relatives. If the young people have stayed out of trouble and were in school or in the military, they would be allowed to move to a legal status and not be deported. The idea has been around since at least 2001, when a bipartisan bill was introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, though details of the bills have varied over the years.

We should also note that the term ""DREAM Act"" has been applied to some state legislation that gives in-state tuition to young illegal immigrants who had been long-time state residents.  

In the context of this fact-check, though, the most applicable legislation is the federal DREAM Act of 2010. The bill wasn’t able to win the 60 votes needed for a full consideration, failing a cloture vote on Dec. 18, 2010. 
We went back to the archives of the Republican primary and soon found what Romney had to say about the DREAM Act. (We contacted the Romney campaign but didn’t hear back.) 
In 2011, the DREAM Act and other immigration issues were hotly debated topics in the Republican primary. Romney took a hard line on illegal immigration and attacked his primary opponents Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry on the issue.

When asked about the DREAM Act in 2011, Romney said he would veto it, but he also said he supported part of the DREAM Act -- the part that allowed people who had served in the military to achieve legal status.

Here’s Romney's answer to a voter on Dec. 31, 2011, in Le Mars, Iowa, who asked if he would veto the DREAM Act if Congress passed it:

""The answer is yes. I’m delighted with the idea that people who come to this country and wish to serve in the military can be given a path to become permanent residents in this country. Those who serve in our military and fulfill those requirements, I respect and acknowledge that path. For those that come here illegally, the idea of giving them in-state tuition credits or other special benefits I find to be the contrary to the idea of a nation of law. If I’m the president of the United States I want to end illegal immigration so that we can protect legal immigration. I like legal immigration.""

(We should note that the DREAM Act did not automatically award in-state tuition to anyone, though some states have those laws on the books.)

Romney recently repeated support for the military portion of the DREAM Act in remarks to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in Orlando on June 21, 2012.

However, Romney declined to say whether he would renew the executive policy of Obama.  

""Some people have asked if I will let stand the president's executive order. The answer is that I will put in place my own long-term solution that will replace and supersede the president's temporary measure,"" he said.

He also criticized Obama for failing to pass comprehensive immigration reform when there were Democratic majorities in the Congress:

""For two years, this president had huge majorities in the House and Senate – he was free to pursue any policy he pleased. But he did nothing to advance a permanent fix for our broken immigration system. Nothing.

The DREAM Act, though, provided a path to legal status to young people who are in school, without serving in the military.

U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta claims bipartisan support for jobs bills
","
There is plenty of blame to go around for the government’s failure to create jobs, according to U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta. But little of it falls on Congress, the New Hampshire Republican said last week as he filed for re-election.

""It is frustrating. Now, in the House of Representatives, we have 40 different jobs bills that have passed and almost all of them have been bipartisan,"" Guinta said June 13, 2012 after he filed his re-election papers with the N.H. Secretary of State. ""That’s significant.""

It’s not hard to believe that Congress passed 40 jobs bills during the 2011-12 session. But, with all the partisan gridlock coming out of Washington, are a majority of them really bipartisan? We decided to check the Congressional voter rolls.

First, we went first to Guinta’s office, which identified a list of jobs-related bills that have passed the House as part of the House Republicans’ Plan for American Job Creators.

The list, published on House Majority Leader Eric Cantor’s website, includes 42 pieces of legislation proposing to rework the country’s tax code, to repeal business regulations and to increase access to energy, among other actions. We are well aware that the two parties define ""jobs bills"" differently, due to philosophical differences about what sorts of policies are useful for expanding jobs. (We address this question here.) However, for this item, we will use Cantor’s list while acknowledging that it’s not the final word on what constitutes a jobs bill.

Of the total 42 bills, 11 of which were signed into law by President Barack Obama, at least 38 received some level of support from both parties, according to searches of THOMAS, the Library of Congress’ searchable database. Vote totals for two of the bills were unavailable.

Some bills, including H.R. 2433, the Veterans Opportunity to Work Act, drew strong support from both sides of the aisle; 235 Republican votes and 183 from Democrats. And, H.R. 3606, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, earned support from 232 Republicans and 183 Democrats. Both bills have become law.

But other proposals drew only a handful of votes from the minority party. H.R. 10, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, for instance, passed the House with 237 Republican votes and four Democratic votes. And, H.R. 658, the FAA Transportation Modernization & Safety Improvement Act, passed with 221 Republican votes and only two from Democrats. The transportation act was signed into law, while the regulations act has stalled in the Senate.

Further, the Fiscal Year 2012 and 2013 budget proposals, known as the Ryan budget plans, both passed the House without any Democratic support.

So, this begs the question, what makes a bill bipartisan?

In Guinta’s view, bipartisan legislation means any bill that reflects the interests of members of both parties.

""Bipartisanship is being able to stay true to your principles, while finding common ground to work together on issues you can find agreement on,"" Derek Dufrense, Guinta’s legislative assistant, wrote in an email statement.

This definition has been used for decades by politicians looking to tout their bipartisan credentials. But, political scientists, analysts and journalists take a different view.

Though there is no formal definition for a bipartisan bill, many political scientists defer to the terms defined by Congressional Quarterly Roll Call, the Washington publication group which has long tracked partisan bills as those that receive support from less than 50 percent of both parties, which would be at least 121 votes from Republicans and 85 votes from Democrats.

""If you take the inverse, that gives you a good sense of how partisan things are,"" said David Hawkings, editor of CQ’s Daily Briefing.

""When I first came to town 25 years ago, you wouldn’t refer to something as having a bipartisan tone to it unless it had a few dozen members of both party. Today, you hear ‘bipartisan’ when there’s only five, six members of the minority party,"" Hawkings said. ""That’s the new reality.""

Under the CQ terms, six of the 42 jobs bills meet the publication’s 50 percent standard, earning votes from half the members of each party.

They are:

-- H.R. 2433 and H.R. 3606, referenced above.

-- H. Res. 72, Review of Federal Regulations: 238 Republican votes, 153 Democrats

-- H.R. 674, 3% Withholding Rule Repeal: 295 Republicans, 170 Democrats; passed the Senate, signed into law.

-- H.R. 1249, the America Invents Act: 168 Republicans, 136 Democrats; passed the Senate, signed into law.

-- H.R. 4105, Applying Countervailing Duty to Nonmarket Economy Countries: 294 Republicans, 176 Democrats; passed the Senate, signed into law.

A 50 percent threshold is pretty high in today's polarized environment, but even if you reduce it to at least 25 percent support from both parties, only 10 bills qualified.

""There are a number of ways you could talk about it, but having only a handful of members of the opposite party, that seems like a big, big stretch,"" said James Pigg, director of the Waggonner Center for Bipartisan Politics and Public Policy at Louisiana Tech University. ""I’d have a hard time calling that bipartisan.""

Our ruling:

Guinta claims that ""in the House of Representatives, we have 40 different jobs bills that have passed and almost all of them have been bipartisan.""

The House of Representatives has indeed passed more than 40 bills that Republicans consider jobs legislation. But whether they are truly ""bipartisan"" depends on your definition.

Thirty-eight of them had support from at least one Democrat. But, according to political analysts, one vote does not a bipartisan bill make. Political analysts and academics alike commonly refer to Congressional Quarterly’s definition of a bipartisan bill as one that receives majority support from both parties. Only a fraction of the 42 bills referenced by Guinta meet that standard -- six to be exact. And even if you lower the threshold to 25 percent, it's only 10 bills.

Guinta makes a sweeping claim that suggests broad support for nearly every bill. But in fact, the levels for bipartisanship are pretty skimpy. We rate this claim Mostly False.","[('\nEmail interview with Derek Dufresne, legislative assistant for U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta, June 19, 2012\n\nInterview with Laena Fallon, spokeswoman for U.S. Rep.

"['History', 'Texas', 'Paul Ryan']","
Paul Ryan says national Coca-Cola study showed Texans and Wisconsinites love their states the most
","
U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, keynoting the Republican Party of Texas convention in Fort Worth, linked pride in Texas and Wisconsin, his home state, telling delegates on June 9, 2012: ""I remember reading a few years ago a story about how Coca-Cola did this big, exhaustive marketing study about how people love their states. First place: Texas. Second place: Wisconsin.""

We sought the skinny on that.

By email, Ryan campaign spokesman Kevin Seifert replied: ""Ryan's statement is fairly straightforward, Wisconsinites and Texans both love and are proud of their home states.""

Seifert also pointed us to an entry on the website of Worthpoint, which provides market data on art, antiques and collectibles including soda paraphernalia. The entry states that national focus groups run by Coca-Cola once found that Wisconsin and Texas natives most strongly identify with their states, and by a wide margin. Also, the entry says, Wisconsin and Texas were the only states the Coca-Cola company allowed to develop logos and advertising lines tying each state to the brand and the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Wisconsin ""developed this program and used it for most of the decade of the nineties.""

Responding to our inquiry, a Worthpoint representative, Nathan Trapuzzano, pointed out by telephone that the online entry is a copy of a December 2006 eBay post related to the completed auction of a Coca-Cola jacket. ""By putting it on our website, we’re not saying every word here is true,"" Trapuzzano said.

We asked eBay to elaborate. By email, spokeswoman Kari Ramirez said eBay could not provide information on the person who posted that information.

We also reached out to the Coca-Cola Company. Spokeswoman Kerry Tressler said that while the company's internal search for such a study came up dry, it is ""likely possible that the study took place.""

In a follow-up email, Tressler said: ""We launched a grassroots marketing effort in the early 1990s called ‘Coca-Cola Texas’ with a similar program in Wisconsin. Given the size and scope of that type of program, it is highly likely there was a marketing study at the time to validate the points of these campaigns.""

An online Nexis search led us to a Feb. 25, 1992, press release about Coca-Cola launching the Texas campaign, the ""most comprehensive marketing initiative ever focusing on a single state."" Separately, Seifert alerted us to a May 11, 1992, press release saying that up to 10 different radio spots would air in Wisconsin that year featuring a fictitious Coca-Cola truck driver touring the state to discover what ""Wisconsin Proud"" is all about. The release calls the campaign an extension of Coca-Cola’s ""Wisconsin Proud"" theme introduced, mainly on billboards, in 1989.

We came up with nothing more potentially related to Ryan’s claim. You might say: That. Is. It.

Our ruling

We count on individuals who air claims to have factual backup. On this front, an unattributed eBay post about focus groups is insufficient. And while it’s believable that Coca-Cola ad campaigns launched 20 years ago drew on research, that does not demonstrate there was an exhaustive national study like the one described by Ryan.

Ryan's claim still strikes us as having a touch of truth. As prideful Texans, we’re hat-in-hand sorry to rate this claim Mostly False.","[('\nEmail, Kevin Seifert, communications director, Paul Ryan campaign, June 12, 2012\n\nTelephone interview, Nathan Trapuzzano, customer care representative, Worthpoint, Columbus, Ohio, June 21, 2012\n\nEmail, Kari Ramirez, spokesperson, Global Communications, eBay Inc., June 21, 2012\n\nEmails (excerpted), responses to PolitiFact Texas, Kerry Tressler, director, Brand & Business Communications, The Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, June 14, 2012 and June 19, 2012\n\nPress releases, Coca-Cola campaigns in Texas and Wisconsin, February 25, 1992 and May 11, 1992 (Nexis search and pointed out by Seifert)', 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/19lmYregd2Eaz8FPrw14q_YoUv9slYiItf8swysz1Xpw/edit')]",/factchecks/2012/jun/22/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-national-coca-cola-study-showed-tex/
"['New Jersey', 'Jobs', 'Joshua Henne']","
Democrat-backed One New Jersey claims the state has lost jobs since Gov. Chris Christie took office
","
On the heels of a cutthroat budget battle, a Democrat-backed group called One New Jersey entered the political scene in mid-July and quickly took aim at Republican Gov. Chris Christie.

In a July 20 press release, One New Jersey spokesman Joshua Henne said: ""After nearly two years of Christie’s bluster, middle-class and working families are far worse-off than when he took office – with less jobs and higher property taxes.""

For this Truth-O-Meter item, PolitiFact New Jersey is focusing on Henne’s claim that New Jersey has fewer jobs now than when Christie took office in January 2010.

After reviewing data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found that the number of non-farm jobs in New Jersey has fluctuated between growth and decline throughout Christie’s tenure. But when Henne made his statement, there was a net increase of jobs, federal data shows.

First, let’s explain how labor statistics are compiled.

Federal labor statistics are measured through two monthly surveys: household interviews and reports from public- and private-sector employers, commonly referred to as the payroll survey.

To support his claim, Henne referred us to household survey data. Those figures show a decrease of 12,266 employed persons in New Jersey between January 2010 and June 2011, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

But there’s a major problem with Henne’s argument: he used the wrong survey to talk about jobs.

The household survey estimates employed persons, while the payroll survey estimates jobs. That’s a critical difference, especially since many Garden State residents work in neighboring states.

Now, let’s turn to the job growth estimates from the payroll survey.

When Christie became governor in January 2010, New Jersey had 3,852,600 non-farm jobs. Based on the payroll survey data publicly available at the time of Henne’s statement, New Jersey had 3,859,000 non-farm jobs in May 2011. Both figures were seasonally adjusted.

That represents an overall increase of 6,400 non-farm jobs. During that time period, New Jersey was split in terms of job growth on a month-to-month basis -- eight months saw job gains and eight months saw job losses, according to data publicly available at the time of Henne’s statement.

New Jersey experienced further non-farm job growth in June 2011, but Jay Meisenheimer, an economist with the Bureau of Labor of Statistics, said the job increases in New Jersey can’t be characterized in any particular direction. ""It just looks like a flat trend,"" he said.

Stanford University economics professor Robert Hall agreed in an email that ""the most you could say is that the change is around zero.""

It’s worth noting that New Jersey’s numbers vary between government and private-sector workers.

Between January 2010 and May 2011, the number of government employees dropped by 24,700, while private-sector jobs increased by 31,100, according to seasonally adjusted figures publicly available at the time of Henne’s statement.

Those changes in private-sector employment are ""the most appropriate indicator of what is happening in the NJ economy,"" according to Rutgers University professor Joseph Seneca.

Henne failed to respond to two questions about his use of the household survey to quantify jobs in New Jersey. ""We stand by the fact that middle-class and working families took a hit when it comes to jobs. Because it is just that, a fact,"" Henne wrote in an email.

Before we issue our ruling, we should point out that although Henne blamed Christie for job losses, some economists said larger factors include individual job markets and the recession. That's also despite the fact that Christie often has taken credit for creating private-sector jobs.

""State policy is an element in job creation and destruction, but the overall condition of the job market in the industries in the state is the larger factor,"" R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia University Business School, said in an email.

Where does all this leave us?

To support his claim that there are ""less jobs"" since Christie took office in January 2010, Henne cited the wrong set of data. The data used to measure jobs shows a slight increase since Christie became governor, even though some economists said the growth is mainly flat.

But New Jersey also has seen an increase in private-sector jobs -- a measure considered by a Rutgers professor to appropriately reflect the state of the economy. Beyond crediting or blaming Christie, economists said other factors include the recession and individual job markets.

We rate the statement False.

"['Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Ron Johnson']","
U.S. Senator Ron Johnson says federal government spending is 25 percent of the economy, compared to 2 percent a century ago
","
As the debt-ceiling crisis deepened, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, lambasted Democrats for failing to put together a public plan to bring down federal spending.

Johnson, in an appearance on CNBC’s ""Squawk Box,"" argued constitutional limits on government spending were the only way to keep politicians’ hands off the pocketbooks of their constituents. To illustrate his point, the freshman Republican reached way back into the history books.

""We’ll increase the debt ceiling, give the president what he wants, and all we’re saying is, ‘Let’s pass a constitutional limitation to the size of government,’ which by the way is the root cause of the problem,"" Johnson said. ""The federal government is spending 25 percent of our entire economy versus 100 years ago, we spent only 2 percent. The problem is the size, the scope, all the regulations and the cost of government.""

PolitiFact National has tested the current end of this claim and found it True. But the back end is new territory.

Has the federal government’s share of the nation’s economy really jumped twelvefold in a century?

A frequently cited source on the history of federal spending is the White House Office of Management and Budget.

Its website shows the federal share of ""gross domestic product"" -- the GDP, essentially our total economic output for a year -- was 25 percent in 2009, 23.8 percent  in 2010 and is estimated at 25.3 percent for 2011.

In 1930, by contrast, the federal government made up just 3.4 percent of the economy.

There are many reasons for the change -- ones that go beyond year-to-year growth in spending for existing programs.

Before the 1930s, the federal government was basically the post office, veterans benefits, a small defense department and national-debt payments, according to an official government summary and experts we consulted. Local government was dominant.

World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam pushed up the federal role considerably, and when that spending waned, it was more than offset as the country aged into Social Security and the Great Society programs --  including Medicare and Medicaid --  took off.

The federal share of the economy went up and down in the 1980s and 1990s, amid recessions, higher debt interest payments, higher health care spending and tax cuts. Homeland security and military spending in Iraq and Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks pushed the number up, as did the recession that began in 2007.

The largest part of the growth since the 1950s, the Office of Management and Budget reports, came from a category that includes Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance, deposit insurance, and means-tested entitlements such as Medicaid, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, the refundable portions of the Earned Income and Child Tax Credits.

""A big part of the difference is that as the U.S. got richer, a lot more services were demanded, and a whole layer of protections unknown in 1910 got assumed by the government,"" said Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist.

As we noted, the current numbers cited by Johnson are accurate.

But what about 100 years ago?

The OMB calculations on the federal share of the economy go back only to 1930, because GDP was not calculated before then.

But earlier spending numbers are readily available, and several researchers have produced calculations dating back to the early 1900s. They use U.S. Census Bureau data that measured the economy in a different way, but produce comparable numbers, according to the economists we consulted.

Johnson’s staff pointed us to 1902. We also looked at other years in that first decade of the century, to see if they were consistent with the year in question.

Economists Robert Gordon at Northwestern University and Randall Holcombe at Florida State University independently calculated a federal share right around 2 percent in that time period.

Our calculations produced a similar result.

So Johnson’s numerical claim is on target.

At the advice of our experts, though, we took one more step: We looked at what the combined local-state-federal share was a century ago compared to today.

If local government was predominant and the federal government minuscule in earlier times, is it possible that all government spending combined took up the same share of the economy as today?

No, we found.

Holcombe said the total government share has gone up markedly, though not on the order of the twelvefold increase in the federal-only share.

Gordon confirms that.

Let’s tally this up.

Johnson turned the clock way back in criticizing the size of the federal government. He claimed it took up just 2 percent of the economy a century ago, but 25 percent today. Johnson’s reference hearkens back to an entirely different era in American governance -- and it’s not clear just how far back in time on a percentage basis Johnson thinks we should go.

But based on widely available, and generally accepted, historical data, he accurately described the dramatic rise of Washington, D.C., in our economic lives over the last 100 years.

We rate his statement True.","[('\nRon Johnson, video of appearance on ""Squawk Box,"" July 25, 2011\n\nOffice of Management and Budget,history of federal outlays (Tables 1.1 and 1.2), accessed July 26, 2011\n\nU.S. Census Bureau, Bicentennial Edition: Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1970, accessed July 26, 2011\n\nOffice of Management and Budget, historical summary of federal budgets, updated May 11, 2009\n\nInterview with Gary Burtless, Brookings Institution, senior fellow, economic studies, Brookings Institution, July 25, 2011\n\nEmail exchange with Robert J.

"['Immigration', 'Rhode Island', 'Elections', 'Travis Rowley']","
Young Republican chairman says the Board of Elections heard eyewitness testimony from residents that illegal aliens voted in Rhode Island elections
","
Controversy continues to churn over the issue of voter identification one month after the General Assembly passed a voter ID bill. Gov. Lincoln Chafee signed it into law on July 2.

Under the new law, voters in the 2012 election will be asked to show some form of identification; in 2014, they’ll be asked for an ID with a photo.

Opponents have continued to complain that it's an expensive solution -- cost estimates for providing free IDs vary widely -- for a problem that essentially doesn't exist. They also maintain it will lower turnout of the poor, elderly and minorities.

Supporters say requiring an ID is essential to the integrity of an election.

The law allows registered voters without an ID to cast a provisional ballot. That ballot will be counted later if the local Board of Canvassers determines that the signature on the ballot application matches the signature on the person's registration.

On July 19, GoLocalProv published a column by Travis Rowley, pundit, chairman of the Rhode Island Young Republicans, and a supporter of voter ID, arguing that past abuses made the new law necessary. (The column grew out of a challenge he accepted during the July 8 edition of Channel 36's ""A Lively Experiment"" to cite a single conviction for voter fraud in the state.)

In the column, Rowley talked about cases in East Providence involving people who voted where they had their businesses -- not where they actually lived. He mentioned anecdotes of people supposedly posing as other voters, citing the claim of Rep. Anastasia Williams, a Providence Democrat.

Williams says that she and her daughter went to their polling place in 2006, only to discover that two other people had used their names. (Rowley reported, incorrectly, that it was last year. Williams never filed a complaint.)

At the end of his column, Rowley played the illegal immigrant card:

""The RI Board of Elections has heard official testimony from Providence residents who claim to have witnessed known illegal aliens voting in local elections,"" he said.

We were intrigued.

So we called Robert Kando, executive director of the board, to find out about these cases.

Kando said that during his six-year tenure with the board, it has heard just one such claim. A check of Journal archives uncovered no cases and former elections board Chairman Roger Begin, who served from 1994 to 2006, said he could not recall any instances.

The case Kando recalled ""was during one of our recount hearings -- it was not the last election, it was a while ago -- where a losing candidate or the candidate's wife, who was looking for a new election, said, 'We saw people who we know aren't U.S. citizens and we know they voted.' The question then was, 'Who?' They said, 'It's just someone that we knew. But we didn't know their names.' ""

Given that lack of specifics, Kando told us, ""there was no need to ask any more questions."" In addition, no complaint was ever filed with the board.

So we sent messages to Rowley on July 22, via email and his website, to tell him what Kando said and to ask if he had additional information. While we waited for a response -- we have yet to receive one -- we did some further checking.

With Kando's help, we went back and checked the records, including listening to the tape of the Sept. 20, 2006, meeting that served as the source of Kando's statement. It turned out that his recollection of that meeting five years ago was off a bit.

The agenda included complaints from two unsuccessful Providence candidates who said they had seen evidence of voter fraud. The board took testimony from both Laura Perez and Eulogio Acevedo, along with hearing from Acevedo's wife, Maryelyn. Contrary to Kando's recollection, the Acevedos made no reference to fraud by illegal immigrants.

But Perez did. She had lost to Grace Diaz in the District 11 primary and in her complaint letter she said, ""I personally witnessed an individual who voted but is not an American citizen."" She reaffirmed that statement during the hearing. Her other allegations of irregularities involved five people, but none of those complaints involved citizenship status.

The board voted to send both complaints to the state police for investigation. Perez told us police never contacted her. Perez's letter gave no names. She told us she knew the identity of the woman -- and that the woman was in the country illegally -- but wasn't going to reveal the name until the state police contacted her.

State police Lt. John Lemont, assistant detective commander, said he recalled the case, one of several that police were probing at the time. But in her letter, ""there wasn't information specific enough to go forward with an investigation. We therefore closed the investigation.""

Asked if he's heard of other allegations of voter fraud involving illegal immigrants, Lemont said, ""I'm unaware of any other complaint, other than this one person."" There have been successful prosecutions, but those have been ""based on people voting in the wrong district.""

The Sept. 20, 2006, elections board meeting also included a presentation by Terry Gorman, president of the then-fledgling Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement. He was seeking support for a voter ID law. Gorman offered no evidence of voter fraud by illegal immigrants.

The only other person to speak on the topic that day was Angel Taveras, now mayor of Providence, who was at the meeting to represent a client but stressed that he was testifying as a private citizen. He complained that citizenship status was being singled out. ""We should make sure there was NO fraudulent voting,"" he said, predicting that if an investigation is undertaken, ""I think what you're going to find is there is very little, if any, of it.""

Perez herself, who believes a lot of the votes cast in her district were done by people paid to engage in voter fraud, said she doubts that many undocumented immigrants were engaging in the practice. ""Undocumented people are less likely to run that type of game,"" she said. ""They're not going to take the risk. For $100? Hell no.""

So, in summary, when Rowley talks about the ""official testimony from Providence residents who claim to have witnessed known illegal aliens voting,"" his statement implies there were several complaints.

There weren’t.

There was just one.

In 2006.

There's a grain of truth to his claim. Perez did report one case. But because Rowley substantially overstated the evidence regarding illegal immigrant voting, the Truth-O-Meter rates his statement Mostly False.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'Tom Leppert']","
Tom Leppert says David Dewhurst is a career politician
","
Tom Leppert, the former Dallas mayor seeking to succeed U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, wasn’t impressed with Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst joining the race.

""It comes as little surprise to me that David Dewhurst has thrown his hat into the ring. Like other career politicians, he has long expressed his interest in a host of higher offices,"" Leppert said in a statement issued July 19, the date Dewhurst posted his declaration video.

We wondered how Leppert, a businessman who was mayor from June 2007 until his resignation in February, adjudged Dewhurst a career politician.

Dewhurst, 65, won his first run for office, state land commissioner, in 1998. Four years later, he was elected lieutenant governor; he was re-elected in 2006 and 2010. The job pays $7,200 a year, though Dewhurst gets temporary bumps by assuming gubernatorial duties every time Gov. Rick Perry is out of state.

So, he’s in his 13th year in office.

But he had jobs before entering politics. After graduating from the University of Arizona, he served in the U.S. Air Force, the CIA and the State Department, according to the biography posted online by his campaign, then returned home to Houston in the 1980s to go into business.

That worked out. In his 1998 campaign, Dewhurst revealed that his 1997 taxable income was $3.7 million, the Houston Chronicle reported. He has put millions of his own dollars into his campaigns.

In April 2010, Dewhurst’s lieutenant governor campaign said he’d experienced a net loss of $1.34 million in 2008, while paying $565,000 in income tax, according to a statement quoted by the Austin American-Statesman.

Leppert spokesman Shawn McCoy told us by email that Leppert was applying the ""career politician"" standard employed by Dewhurst in 1998 against his Democratic opponent, Richard Raymond. At the time, McCoy said, ""Dewhurst repeatedly called Raymond a ‘career politician.’ Raymond had spent three terms (six years) in the Texas Legislature.""

""It would be comical for Dewhurst to claim that after spending the past 12 years in statewide elected office, including three terms as lieutenant governor, that he is not a career politician,"" McCoy said.

McCoy also passed along newspaper stories from that year including a January 1998 San Antonio Express-News article quoting Dewhurst saying, ""I am … the underdog against career politicians."" At the time, he was poised to face then-state Sen. Jerry Patterson in the Republican primary.

Mindful there’s no set definition for ""career politician,"" we sought professorial perspective.

Antonio Merlo, a University of Pennsylvania economist who once analyzed how many U.S. House members proved career politicians, told us in an interview that a fair definition is somebody who has been a politician most of their working life, often by advancing through different levels of governance.

Merlo agreed the term is often tossed out as a pejorative even though, he said, there’s nothing inherently wrong with being a career politician: ""Every job, you’re learning while doing. Politics is a full-time occupation. It’s very complex, especially if you want to do it at a high level.""

More significant, Merlo said, is whether an officeholder has been constructive or just there ""because they’re lazy and they want to survive off the spoils.""

Merlo encouraged us to contact Princeton University political scientist Nolan McCarty, who had no objections to Merlo’s definition of a career politician.  Of Dewhurst, McCarty said a dozen years in politics ""for somebody that age doesn’t strike me as your typical career politician."" In contrast, he said, a Dewhurst predecessor as lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock, started in politics as a young man and was absolutely a career politician.

Our take: Dewhurst may be into his second (or third or fourth) career. But he’s held office less than a third of his adult life. We rate Leppert’s statement False.","[('\nEmail, response to PolitiFact Texas, Tom Leppert campaign, news clippings, response to PolitiFact Texas, July 20, 2011\n\nTom Leppert, press release, ""Tom Leppert Statement On Dewhurst Campaign Announcement,"" July 19, 2011\n\nTelephone interview, Nolan McCarty, professor of politics and public affairs, Princeton University, July 22, 2011\n\nTelephone interview, Antonio M.

"['New Jersey', 'LGBTQ', 'Marriage', 'Steven Goldstein']","
Garden State Equality Chairman Steven Goldstein says polls now show a majority of Catholics support gay marriage
","
Last weekend was ""bittersweet"" for Steven Goldstein.

Same-sex couples could wed legally in New York, while Goldstein, the head of the gay rights advocacy group Garden State Equality, said New Jersey is ""still denied that freedom.""

Goldstein, whose group filed a lawsuit this summer aiming to legalize same-sex marriage in New Jersey, argued in a July 24 column published in The Sunday Star-Ledger’s Perspective section that New Jersey’s civil union law doesn’t provide real equality.

""The governor cites his faith as a basis for his opposition to marriage equality,"" wrote Goldstein. ""But no faith is monolithic on any issue. Polls now show a majority of Catholics favor marriage equality, as does the general electorate.""

Do a majority of Catholics really favor gay marriage?

Goldstein provided PolitiFact New Jersey with two national surveys to support his statement, and they mostly do.

First, let’s note that both polls -- and another survey we found -- highlighted the views of white Catholics. Pollsters said this is done to control for race and because white Catholics are considered a swing voter group. But we’re going to look at all Catholics since Goldstein didn’t distinguish.

Also, because the Catholics made up a smaller group than the poll sample, the margins of error are higher.

An ABC News/Washington Post poll released in March asked 1,005 adults, ""do you think it should be legal or illegal for gay and lesbian couples to get married?"" It found that among those who identified themselves as Catholic, 60 percent support same-sex marriage and 38 percent oppose it, with a 7.5 percentage point margin of error.  

A Public Religion Research Institute poll released in May surveyed 1,007 adults. It asked respondents whether they strongly favor, favor, oppose or strongly oppose ""allowing gay and lesbian couples to legally marry.""

It found among the Catholics surveyed, 56 percent either favored or strongly favored and 36 percent either opposed or strongly opposed, with a margin of error of 7 percentage points.

It’s worth noting that in another national poll by the Public Religion Research Institute from September 2010, when Catholics were given the option of choosing civil unions, support for marriage dipped.

It found that of the Catholics surveyed, 43 percent said gay couples should be allowed to marry, 31 percent said gay couples should be allowed to form civil unions but not marry and 22 percent said there should be no legal recognition of a gay couple’s relationship. It’s also worth noting that in that poll, the more often Catholics said they went to church, the less likely they were to support same-sex marriage.

A national Quinnipiac University poll released in July that asked 2,311 registered voters whether they ""would support or oppose a law in your state that would same-sex couples to get married?""

Of the Catholics surveyed, 53 percent said they would support such a law in their state and 41 percent said they would oppose, with a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points.

Mark Gray, a research associate with the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, pointed to his analysis of 2010 data from the General Social Survey, which found that 48 percent of Catholics either strongly agreed or agreed that ""homosexual couples should have the right to marry one another"" and 36 percent disagreed or strongly disagreed, with a 5.8 percentage point margin of error.

""Right now at this point you can’t really say it’s a majority, you can’t really say it’s not a majority, given the margin of error,"" Gray said.

Michele Dillon, chair of University of New Hampshire’s department of sociology, said ""the actual percentage varies poll to poll, it’s either close or over 50 percent,"" but, ""the momentum is in favor of same-sex marriage"" -- both nationally and among Catholics.

Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, said ""there’s no question there’s been a movement"" in favor of same-sex marriage, mostly driven by a younger generation. Young people, ""including young Catholics, are far more likely to be supportive of gay marriage,"" he said.

But, Donohue argued, ""people tend to be a bit more liberal"" when asked their opinion on the phone, ""as opposed to the privacy of the ballot box.""

Back to Goldstein’s statement.

Goldstein said, ""polls now show a majority of Catholics favor marriage equality."" We found polls generally support his claim.

However, because the margins of error are so high -- enough to possibly affect the results -- we rate Goldstein’s statement Mostly True.

"['Federal Budget', 'History', 'Florida', 'Allen West']","
Allen West says spending cuts are part of a debt ceiling increase for the first time in history
","U.S. Rep. Allen West supports Speaker John Boehner's plan for cutting spending and raising the debt ceiling, even though some of his fellow tea party supporters have been skeptical. 

On July 27, 2011, he appeared on CNN to defend the plan.

""We can sit around and try to come up with the 100 percent plan, and this plan definitely is not it,"" said West, R-Plantation. I'll give it about a 70 to 75 percent rating. But it is a plan that I can take and I can execute to 100 percent. I think the most important thing when I look at this, it still does fit within the framework that I'll support of cut, cap and balance,"" he said.

""So I'm very pleased that I can stand to support this because we don't have the tax hikes that I don't want to see happen, and we don't have the complete blank check that's going to be given to the president of $2.4 trillion. This is the first time in the history that we've had the raising of a debt limit also with spending cuts,"" he added.

We should point out that raising the debt limit does not give the president ""a blank check."" Congress still retains its usual power to approve or deny spending. We looked at a similar statement from Eric Cantor, the Republican House majority leader, and rated it False. 

Here, we were interested in West's point that this was the first time a debt ceiling vote had ever been paired with spending cuts. Was this year's debt proposal that historic?

In a word, no.

We spent a long time mulling the details of federal legislation over the past 30 or so years. We found a few different examples that contradict West's statement.

The most recent example of legislation to raise the debt ceiling that also included spending cuts was the 1997 agreement between President Bill Clinton and House Republicans led by Speaker Newt Gingrich. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included net reductions in direct spending of $122 billion over five years and increased the debt limit to $5.95 trillion, from $5.5 trillion, according to a 2005 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. 

The deal included spending cuts, tax cuts and new spending on social programs supported by Clinton. At the time, the agreement was expected to lead to a balanced budget by 2002. In fact, the budget went into surplus in 1998. (Keep in mind that there was still substantial public debt at this point, but at least the government wasn't spending more than it took in during a given year.)

News coverage from the 1997 deal depicted it as a great victory for the Republicans, though one with bipartisan support. Here's how USA Today's story began on July 31, 1997: 

""The Republican-led House of Representatives, savoring the afterglow of a successful engagement with a Democratic president, voted overwhelmingly Thursday for a spending plan that should balance the federal budget by 2002.

""The measure sailed through the House by a lopsided 346-85 vote on a wave of bipartisan self-congratulation, standing ovations and paeans to the promise of protecting generations to come.

""Speaker Newt Gingrich, who in past years has conceded being outmaneuvered by President Clinton on the budget, triumphantly announced the vote. Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, strode onto the House floor clapping his hands in anticipation of leading the Senate debate to a similar conclusion today.""

After the debt ceiling was raised in 1997, it wasn't raised again until the George W. Bush administration in 2002. The debt ceiling was raised seven times during the Bush administration, and it's been raised three times already during the Obama administration.

We found two other examples of budget agreements that included automatic mechanisms to cut spending. 

The 1990 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act set caps to cut discretionary spending along with new pay-you-go rules, and that too included a debt ceiling increase. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act of 1985 set strict deficit targets and automatic spending cuts if the yearly deficit targets were breached. Lawmakers knew that the automatic spending cuts were virtually certain to take effect, and they did. 

""The debt ceiling has been used numerous times in the past to enact both budget enforcement procedures and actual spending cuts, often to make debt ceiling increases more politically palatable,"" said Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst with the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

As we finished our research, we wondered if West meant whether it was the first time the spending cuts had equaled the increase in the debt ceiling. The 1997 agreement would not meet that criteria. Even if that's what he meant, that's not how West phrased his statement on CNN.

West said, ""This is the first time in the history that we've had the raising of a debt limit also with spending cuts."" We found that the 1997 budget agreement raised the debt ceiling and also included spending cuts. So we rate his statement False. ","[('CNN,\xa0interview with Allen West, July 27, 2011\n\nCongressional Research Service, via OpenCRS,\xa0The Budget Reconciliation Process: House and Senate Procedures, Aug. 10, 2005\n\nTHOMAS,\xa0The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Sept. 9, 1997\n\nCongressional Research Service, ""The Debt Limit: History and Recent Increases,"" July 1, 2011\n\nKeith Hennessy,\xa0The 1997 Bipartisan Budget Agreement cut spending and cut taxes, July 9, 2011\n\nFactcheck.org,\xa0The Budget and Deficit Under Clinton, Feb. 11, 2008\n\nRoll Call,\xa0A look back: Debt ceiling debate then and now, June 14, 2011\n\nCNN,\xa0President Clinton announces another record budget surplus, Sept. 27, 2000\n\nInterview with Richard Kogan of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, July 28, 2011\n\nE-mail interview with Jason Peuquet of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, July 28, 2011\n\nE-mail interview with J.D.

Bill O'Reilly says poverty hasn't budged since 1965 despite 'trillions' spent
","On July 26, 2011, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly took aim at government efforts to aid the poor, suggesting that they were not only a contributor to the nation’s current debt problems but that they also weren’t effective on their own terms.

""What the debt situation is really, really all about is your right to pursue happiness,"" O’Reilly said. ""America is the greatest country on earth because it gives the most people the most opportunity to prosper. It does that by using the free marketplace whereby people can work hard, make money and provide for themselves and their families.

""But since the mid-1960s, America has practiced social engineering. Spending tax money directly, trying to improve the lives of those who don't have very much. Those payments are called entitlements. And they are now so high they threaten to bankrupt the entire nation. Liberal Americans tend to support the entitlement society while conservatives are more inclined to promote individualism and smaller entitlement spending.

""President (Barack) Obama, of course, is a liberal. And the Democratic Party is now dominated by the left. That's why in the past two and a half years federal spending has broken the bank. ...

""The essential mistake that Barack Obama is making is that he believes Lyndon Johnson's Great Society entitlements can elevate the poor to prosperity. They can't. In 1965, the poverty rate in this country stood at 14 percent. Now, after untold trillions have been spent fighting poverty, the poverty rate is 14.3 percent. Amazing, is it not? The conclusion, America is bankrupting itself with an entitlement philosophy that does little.""

A reader asked us to look at O’Reilly’s statement. It covers a lot of ground, but the part we were interested in analyzing was his claim that since 1965, the United States has spent ""untold trillions,"" yet the poverty rate hasn’t budged.

First, some background on the Great Society. It was an agenda put forward by Johnson after he was elevated to president upon the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He was able to enact various parts of the agenda after winning a landslide victory in 1964. It included such ongoing programs as Medicare, Medicaid, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; and Head Start. It also included such defunct efforts as the Office of Economic Opportunity, which spearheaded localized anti-poverty efforts.

Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, cautions that O’Reilly’s comment overlooks the actual purpose of the Great Society programs, which wasn’t to boost incomes directly, in a way that would be detectable in poverty statistics, but rather to ""improve the health care, nutrition and educational attainment or performance of Americans.""

If the programs were successful, Burtless said, ""it was because they improved the health care received by the old and poor, they improved the schooling received by disadvantaged youngsters and they improved the nutritional quality of the diets of the poor. These programs may eventually have reduced ‘money poverty,’ but only if improving medical care, educational attainment and nutritional intake has an indirect effect that reduces money poverty.""

That said, we’ll take O’Reilly’s statement on its own terms and offer our critique.

• He uses the wrong numbers. The poverty rate -- the percentage of Americans whose income is lower than the federally determined poverty line -- was 17.3 percent in 1965, not 14 percent. For 2009, O’Reilly is correct -- the rate was 14.3 percent.

So if you compare the poverty rate in those two years, it has fallen by 3 percentage points, or by about one-sixth its original level. It didn’t stay roughly constant, as O’Reilly claimed.

• The poverty rate has fallen even further if you start counting a few years before the Great Society began. Between 1959 and 1962, the poverty rate ranged between 20 and 22 percent. If you compare that level to 2009, poverty declined by an even steeper rate -- by more than one-third.

• The most recent recession has affected the numbers. We have no quarrel with O'Reilly using the 2009 figure as his endpoint -- it’s the most recent figure available -- but as long as he has chosen it, we’ll provide some important context. That year came within the midst of the Great Recession, and recessions typically lead to spikes in poverty.

By simply moving the endpoint two years earlier, to 2007, you would get an endpoint of 12.5 percent. So if you compare poverty rates in 1965 and 2007, the rate dropped by nearly five percentage points during that period, or by almost one-third.

• Poverty among the elderly has plummeted. In 1967, about 30 percent of seniors were below the poverty line. That was down to 13.2 percent by 2008 -- a reduction by more than half.

One of Johnson’s greatest legislative achievements -- Medicare, the federal health care program for those 65 years and over -- helped lower elderly poverty, as did Social Security, a program that started under President Franklin D. Roosevelt but which Johnson enhanced with legislation in 1965 and 1967. A subsequent law enacted in 1973 began automatic, annual cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security beneficiaries. To the extent that Medicaid also helps poor older Americans, that has helped as well.

All three of these programs, we should add, certainly qualify as entitlements that O’Reilly targets in his comment.

• Certain subgroups have seen steep drops in poverty over the same period. Poverty among blacks was 55 percent in 1959 and 41 percent in 1966. By 2009, the rate had fallen to 25.9 percent. For black single moms without a father present, the poverty rate fell from 70.6 percent in 1959 and 65.3 in 1966 to 39.8 percent in 2009.

Many Americans would say that 25.9 percent of blacks and 39.8 percent of black single mothers in poverty is still too high. Still the rates are still down dramatically over the period O’Reilly is referring to.

Meanwhile, Hispanic poverty is up a few points since 1972 (the earliest year for which we have data) but poverty among Hispanic single moms with no father present has fallen from 53.5 percent in 1972 to 40.6 percent in 2009.

• Alternate measurements of poverty show even steeper declines than the official statistics. A number of statisticians led by Douglas Besharov -- a University of Maryland scholar previously with the conservative American Enterprise Institute -- have come up with a more detailed measure of poverty that they say is more accurate than the official government statistic. Their alternative statistic includes factors ignored in the official statistics but which help poor Americans make it from day to day.

Here’s a rundown of the changes the Besharov group suggests, along with their impact on the poverty rate.

Using a corrected inflation adjustment (to correct what they believe was an error in the 1970s): Lowers the poverty rate by 2 percentage points.

Counting funds received from the Earned Income Tax Credit: Lowers the poverty rate by about 0.5 percentage points.

Including the income of other people living in the same home: Lowers the poverty rate by 1 percentage point.

Imputing income from the wealth in highly appreciated homes, a factor most important for poor elderly Americans: Lowers the poverty rate by 0.6 percentage points

Treating food stamps, housing assistance, and free- or reduced-price school lunches as the equivalent of income: Lowers the poverty rate by about 1.3 percentage points. (This does, however, exclude the value of Medicaid, which Besharov estimated at roughly $3,225 per person.)

Correcting for under-reporting of transfer payments: Lowers the poverty rate by about 0.8 percentage points.

Correcting for the under-reporting of other types income: Lowers the poverty rate by about 1.6 percentage points.

The grand total of these reductions is 7.8 percentage points, which would reduce the current poverty rate from 14.3 percent to 6.5 percent.
 
We ran all of our critiques by a number of independent experts, including both liberals and conservatives, and they agreed that O'Reilly was incorrect. We also contacted The O'Reilly Factor, and a spokesman said the show plans to correct the record on its Monday, Aug. 1 show. This is not to say that O’Reilly is entirely wrong. Present levels of entitlements may not be sustainable, as he suggests. O’Reilly might be right that relatively few of the poor have been lifted into ""prosperity,"" as opposed to somewhere slightly above the poverty line. And the final 14 percent of Americans may be the most difficult to lift out of poverty, suggesting that at some point the cost-benefit ratio for anti-poverty expenditures may become harder to defend.

""The issue of whether we’re spending these social welfare dollars well, particularly on the margin, is an important one, and I think many people with very different political persuasions would agree we are not,"" said Eugene Steuerle, a fellow with the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.

Still, the official statistics show that poverty has declined over the years -- indeed, quite steeply for certain groups -- and at least one unofficial estimate shows even lower rates today.

Cantor says Reid debt proposal gives ""blank check"" to Obama
","
In a recent television interview, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor boldly predicted that Republicans in his chamber would unite to pass Speaker John Boehner’s plan to lift the nation’s debt ceiling.

Cantor, R-7th, said House Republicans were concluding that Boehner’s plan is their best option to cut federal spending while ensuring, at least temporarily, that the U.S. continues to pay back its loans.

Cantor dismissed as ""unacceptable"" the option of not increasing the $14.3 trillion debt limit by Aug. 2, when the nation will start running short of funds to pay its obligations. He was scornful of a proposal by Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to raise the debt limit.

""Harry Reid’s plan is basically giving the president a blank check, giving him what he wants, a blind increase of the debt ceiling to spend the money the way he wants,"" Cantor said during a July 26 interview on Fox News.

We wondered whether Reid’s plan really would present President Barack Obama a blank check -- a claim repeatedly made by Cantor and Boehner.  

First, a little background. Reid’s proposal would raise the debt ceiling by $2.7 trillion, enough to last until 2013. Boehner’s two-step plan would allow the limit to increase by $900 billion now and force Obama to seek a second hike before next year’s elections.

Both proposals claim to cut spending by $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years. Neither plan seeks a tax increase. Boehner would require Congress to vote on a balanced budget amendment; Reid would not.

We asked asked Megan Whittemore, Cantor’s deputy press secretary, to explain the majority leader’s factual basis for calling Reid’s plan ""a blank check"" for Obama.

""We are confident that your readers will understand the common meaning of the metaphor of a `blank check,’"" she e-mailed back to us. ""However, to help you along we first turn to About.com in the grammar section where you will find the following helpful.""

Whittemore pasted in a three-paragraph definition that began, ""A figure of speech is a rhetorical device that achieves a special effect by using words in distinctive ways."" It said, among other things, that sometimes people rely on ""hyperbole to emphasize a point (`I’m starving!’).""

She also sent us two definitions of ""blank check."" One, by Dictionary.com, defines it as ""unrestricted authority; a free hand.""  Another, by Wikipedia, says blank check ""in the figurative or metaphoric sense, is used (especially in politics) to describe a situation in which an agreement had been made that is open-ended or vague, and therefore subject to abuse.""

Whittemore noted that Boehner’s two-step plan would require Congress to hit spending-cut goals before Obama could ask Congress for the second increase in the debt. That, Republicans say, would put more pressure on Washington to reduce spending than Reid’s proposal, which would allow a larger, longer-lasting hike in the debt cap.

We ran Cantor’s ""blank check"" analogy by four Washington policy analysts who are closely watching the debt ceiling debate. They were all perplexed by the statement and pointed out a simple reason why Reid’s plan would not give Obama carte blanche: Under the U.S. Constitution, only Congress can appropriate money.

""Congress has to authorize new spending and changes in taxation,"" said Norman J. Ornstein, a political scientist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""The president can sign or veto those bills. He can’t do anything without congressional authority.""

Ornstein added, ""Cantor is being totally, deliberately misleading.""

Steve Ellis, vice-president of the non-partisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, had a similar take. ""Rep. Cantor’s comment isn’t really correct,"" he said.

We were also given a second reason why Cantor’s statement is inaccurate: Raising the debt limit will pay for past obligations made by the U.S. government, not new ones.

""The need to raise the debt limit is a factor of past spending and tax decision (in addition to the recent economic downturn) enacted by previous congresses and presidents pushing borrowing needs up,"" said Jason Peuquet, an analyst with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a middle-of-the-road, budget-hawk group.

Let’s review:

Cantor said Senate Majority Leader Reid’s proposal to raise the debt ceiling would be ""basically giving the president a blank check, giving him what he wants, a blind increase of the debt ceiling to spend the money the way he wants.""

A number of policy analysts told us Cantor’s statement is simply incorrect. Only Congress can appropriate money. Obama can only spend what he’s given. Reid’s plan does not change that constitutional requirement.

Cantor’s office failed to provide a single fact to back the Republican’s contention that Reid’s proposal would give the president a free hand in spending. Cantor’s spokeswoman said he was speaking metaphorically and people understand that. We find that logic hard to accept, particularly at a time of great public divide when the financial integrity of the nation is at stake.

We rate Cantor’s statement False.","[('\nFox News, Cantor: Obama;s ""Playing Bully Politics"" and ""We’re Calling His Bluff,""\xa0July 26, 2011.\n\nEmail interview with Megan Whittemore, Deputy press secretary for Rep.

Founder of Tea Party Nation claims U.S. government has spent $2.6 million to teach Chinese prostitutes how to drink responsibly
","
America has a spending crisis, not a debt crisis, Judson Phillips, founder and chief executive of Tea Party Nation, argued in an opinion piece published by the Washington Post on July 27, 2011. He called the federal government bloated and lambasted legislators for funding too many wasteful programs.

And then he offered a few examples.

""Americans rightly think there is something wrong when our government has spent $2.6 million to teach Chinese prostitutes how to drink responsibly,"" Phillips wrote.

We fact-checked a similar claim during the midterm elections. The claim was that members of Congress voted for the project as part of the stimulus. Actually, the project was not part of the stimulus, and members of Congress had no way of knowing research funding would go to study prostitutes. Because of these other distortions -- that the op-ed doesn't make -- we gave the 2010 claim a Pants on Fire.

But there's not nothing here.

In November 2008, the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health awarded a 5-year, $2.6 million grant to Wayne State University in Detroit to allow Dr. Xiaoming Li, professor and director of the university's Prevention Research Center, to ""establish and evaluate whether an alcohol and HIV intervention center can assist in reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS among sex workers in China,"" according to a university press release announcing the grant.

According to the release, ""The findings could have ramifications for at-risk populations throughout the world.""

The research will take place specifically in Guangxi, China, where the sex trade is prevalent and the rate of HIV is ranked third among the country's provinces, the release states.

A spokesman for the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health told us the ad distorted the aim of the project.

The grant ""was not awarded for that purpose,"" John Bowersox told us via e-mail back in November 2010. ""Rather, the researchers will use the grant to develop, implement and evaluate an alcohol use and HIV risk reduction intervention program among female sex workers in China. This is in line with previous studies showing that social norms and institutional policy in commercial sex venues greatly influence alcohol use and sexual behavior among the sex workers in those venues. Studies such as these are needed to translate and adapt interventions that have proven to be effective in the U.S. to other settings and to learn from other conditions and cultures to inform our understanding of the causes, consequences and differences in HIV-related risks, morbidity and mortality in diverse populations. Preventing HIV infection is NIH’s highest priority for HIV-related research. We need to explore a range of research avenues in vulnerable populations around the world to learn the best ways to control the transmission of HIV.""

Bowersox noted that the grant went through the NIH's two-tier review process, ""which includes a scientific and technical review as well as consideration by an Advisory Council that includes public representatives. The Council makes recommendations based on alignment of the grant application with the research priorities of the NIH.""

The grant first came into the national discussion after CNSNews.com (The Right News. Right Now) ran a story under the headline, ""U.S. Will Pay $2.6 Million to Train Chinese Prostitutes to Drink Responsibly on the Job.""

In an interview with CNSNews.com, Professor Li said, ""The purpose of the project is to try and develop an intervention program targeting HIV risk and alcohol use. So basically, it’s an alcohol and HIV risk reduction intervention project.""

""We want to get some understanding of the fundamental role of alcohol use and HIV risk,"" Li told CNSNews.com. ""We use the population in China as our targeted population to look at the basic issues. I think the findings will benefit the American people, too.""

The CNSNews story ran on May 11, 2009. That was about the time that a lot of Republican members of Congress were putting out lists of stimulus projects they said were wasteful or unrelated to job creation. But, as the CNSNews.com story noted, the grant for the project was awarded in November 2008. That's pre-stimulus. It's also pre-Obama administration. 

But Phillips did not refer to the spending as a stimulus program. Nor did Phillips assign responsibility for funding it to any particular party (though earlier in the article, he referred to the ""Obama-Pelosi-Reid axis of fiscal evil""). However, Phillips does distort the purpose of the grant. And while some may question the actual purpose of the grant, it was awarded by the National Institutes for Health based on its own internal review process and was determined to be within the institution's mission and priorities. There is an alcohol intervention aspect to the project, but the larger purpose is HIV study and prevention. We rate the claim Half True.","[('\nWashington Post, Op-Ed: ""Why the Tea Party is unyielding on the debt ceiling,"" by Judson Phillips, July 27, 2011\n\nFox News, ""NIH Funds $2.6 Million Study to Get Prostitutes in China to Drink Less,"" March 14, 2009\n\nPolitiFact, ""Mike Prendergast mailer says Kathy Castor voted for $2.6 million to teach prostitutes in China to drink responsibly,"" by Robert Farley, Nov. 1, 2010\n\nCNSNews.com, ""U.S. Will Pay $2.6 Million to Train Chinese Prostitutes to Drink Responsibly on the Job,"" by Edwin Mora, May 11, 2009\n\nWayne State University School of Medicine website, ""Grant allows researcher to study link between alcohol abuse and spread of HIV,"" Nov. 5, 2008\n\nClerk of the House website, Vote results for Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations for FY 2008\n\nClerk of the House website, Vote results for Department of Homeland Security Appropriations for FY 2008', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-tea-party-is-unyielding-on-the-debt-ceiling/2011/07/27/gIQAGvEVdI_story.html')]",/factchecks/2011/jul/29/judson-phillips/founder-tea-party-nation-claims-us-government-has-/

We Are Wisconsin says State Senator Alberta Darling offered ""unqualified support"" for a U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan's plan to end Medicare
","
State Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, handed her recall opponent a big opening when she was asked about U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s hotly debated Medicare plan and heaped praise on him.

Or did she?

At a June 10, 2011, fundraiser in Milwaukee, Darling told an audience during questions and answers that Ryan is ""doing the exact right thing to try to reform"" Medicare.

Her comments are available to anyone, thanks to a new reality in partisan politics: Once-private talks are now routinely captured on video by bloggers, political parties or interested groups.

In this case, one of the two videos of Darling’s remarks was done for We Are Wisconsin, the labor coalition backing Democrats in the Senate recalls.

The Progressive WI channel on YouTube posted a long version on June 11, 2011, and We Are Wisconsin put up a shorter but better-quality video on June 13, 2011. The Journal Sentinel wrote about it on June 14, 2011, in an All Politics blog post headlined, ""Darling backs Ryan’s Medicare plan.""

A few weeks passed, but then things really got interesting.

The National Journal reported Darling told one of its reporters in June that she had taken no position on Ryan’s plan at the fundraiser. ""I didn’t say I supported his Medicare effort,"" the publication quoted Darling as saying.

Around the same time, state Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, Darling’s opponent in the August recall election, put up a TV spot saying Darling ""supports ending Medicare"" -- a reference to the recorded comments.

Then on July 14, 2011, after a protest at her office, Andrew Davis, Darling’s campaign manager, told Fox Point-Bayside Patch: ""Senator Darling has no opinion on the matter.""

The reaction was swift.

The next day We Are Wisconsin blasted Darling and Ryan in a July 15 news release, saying she was dishonestly denying her ""unqualified,"" ""unequivocal,"" ""unwavering,"" ""ironclad"" support for a ""radical plan that ends Medicare"" or proposes ""gutting"" it or would ""scrap"" it.

Strong words. Does the video tell the tale of ""unqualified support""?

We’ll look at a claim in two parts: (1) that Darling offered unqualified support for Ryan’s plan and (2) that Ryan’s plan would ""end"" Medicare.

There is no dispute about the authenticity of the video.

As these things go, the question-and-answer exchange is actually clear. Darling’s camp says her answer was unscripted, but she was fully aware the exchange was being recorded. Her remarks are not an aside; she eagerly took the microphone and spoke for more than a minute.

The question from an unidentified male was direct:  ""What do you think of Representative Ryan’s Medicare changes?""

Here’s the full exchange:

""You know, I was asked at the beginning of the week what I think about Rep. Ryan’s Medicare reforms, and they were trying to tie me to Ryan and thought that would be a negative for me.

""I said, ‘I’m standing with Ryan anytime, anywhere. He’s a leader.’ And I said ‘You guys are lying about what he’s doing with Medicare ... 55 and older Medicare stays; 55 and younger, there are new reforms so that health care actions can be available when people get to be seniors.""

She finished:

""So, I think Paul Ryan is doing the exact right thing to try to reform Medicaid because Medicaid is going to go broke. But they’re lying. People 55 and older will keep Medicare. 55 and younger will have a reform of Medicare to have options so that health care can continue.

""Totally, go Paul Ryan!"" Darling said to applause. ""They are trying to label that as a negative. I said, "" ‘Are you kidding, he’s absolutely a hero.’ ""

We requested an interview with Darling; she declined. Davis provided written answers to our questions.

In her response to us, Darling did not take a position on Ryan’s plan, instead reiterating she can’t vote on Medicare changes, and she admires Ryan’s leadership on the issue.

""I did not and do not endorse Congressman Ryan’s plan,"" her response said. ""I do not want to see Medicare end, I want to see it continue to provide for our seniors. But if we do not do anything about it, it’s not going to be there for future generations.""

The intent of her answer at the event, Darling’s statement said, was to ""combat the lies"" about Ryan’s plan.

Davis said Darling’s ""exact right thing"" remark was only in reference to Ryan’s taking on the issue, not the specifics of his plan.

Kelly Steele, spokesman for We Are Wisconsin, countered that Darling discusses details of the plan and shows her cards by saying Ryan’s attempt at Medicare reform is the ""exact right thing."" The group says Darling is now reacting to residents’ concerns about cuts to Medicare.

""Her attempt to walk this back is laughable,"" Steele said. ""I have not seen a more unequivocal embrace of Paul Ryan’s plan than that piece of video.""

Let’s go back to the tape -- and the We Are Wisconsin claim -- and examine the two pieces of this.

For her part, Darling’s campaign contends she only embraced Ryan and Ryan’s drive to reform Medicare -- not the specifics.

But she discusses and defends key aspects of it, and -- in response to a question about what she thought about the plan -- offers that he is doing the ""exact right thing.""

If Darling wanted to express neutrality, she could have prefaced her comments or framed them as such. She could have embraced Ryan and still made clear she was taking no position on his plan. Instead she offers not even a hint of concern or caution about Ryan’s plan and invites the conclusion that she backs it wholeheartedly with comments such as ""totally, go"" and ""standing with Ryan anytime, anywhere.""

Most importantly, the question wasn’t Ryan’s courage or his place in history -- it was what she thought of his plan. The question, perhaps designed for this purpose, was specific.

We think many listeners would judge her remarks in that narrow context and take her enthusiastic back-slapping comments as at least a general endorsement of his plan.

But Darling didn’t come right out and say she endorses his plan.

And this was an apparently unscripted response at a GOP fundraiser where you might expect Darling to lead cheers for Ryan. We could find no other, more formal statements by Darling on the plan.

Looking at the whole context, though, we think it’s generally true Darling offered unqualified support.

Now the back end of the claim.

The problem for We Are Wisconsin is that it says Ryan’s plan would ""end"" or ""scrap"" Medicare. The group qualifies the language at times, but the overwhelming impression left is that Ryan’s plan would mean the end of Medicare -- and that this is what Darling supported.

PolitiFact has repeatedly ruled False the notion that Ryan’s plan would end the program. It would change dramatically, yes, but it would still exist.

So where does that leave this two-part statement on the Truth-O-Meter?

On balance, we rate the statement from the group Half True.","[('\nWe Are Wisconsin, news release on Alberta Darling, July 15, 2011\n\nProgressive WI YouTube channel, video of Darling remarks at fundraiser, posted June 11, 2011\n\nWe Are Wisconsin PAC, video of Darling remarks, posted June 13, 2011\n\nNational Journal, ""What We Can Learn From Wisconsin,"" July 7, 2011\n\nPatch.com, ""Dozens protest outside Darling’s campaign office,"" July 14, 2011\n\nInterview with Andrew Davis, Darling campaign spokesman, July 14, 2011\n\nInterview with Kelly Steele, spokesman for We Are Wisconsin, July 22, 2011\n\nAlberta Darling, response to PolitiFact, July 20, 2011\n\nJSOnline.com, ""Darling backs Ryan’s Medicare plan,"" June 14, 2011', 'http://www.wearewisconsin.org/media/alberta-darling-continues-to-dishonestly-deny-her-support-for-gutting-medicare/')]",/factchecks/2011/jul/29/we-are-wisconsin/we-are-wisconsin-says-state-senator-alberta-darlin/
"['Oregon', 'Race and Ethnicity', 'Charlie Hales']","
When Charlie Hales was on the Portland City Council, it diversified the Fire Bureau
","
PolitiFact Oregon is leery of statements from politicians touting their accomplishments as they run for office. So we were on our guard when we came across this boast in Charlie Hales’ letter to Portland on his website:
  
""I’m good at solving problems and getting things done. When I served as City Commissioner, we … successfully fought for, and won, adding women and people of color to the Fire Bureau."" 
Hales has a reputation for championing streetcars and high-density living, but diversifying a bureau? We wanted to know what happened at the Portland Fire Bureau, and the nature of Hales’ role in the fight to add more women and people of color to a traditionally white male profession.

Hales was elected in 1992 and given oversight of the Fire Bureau as part of his portfolio. On Sept, 7, 1994, the Portland City Council approved a new firefighter trainee program, specifically to boost the number of women and people of color at the fire bureau. Hales, making the pitch, explained that the goal of the program was to recruit potential firefighters and train them to take the firefighter exam.

The Oregonian reported at the time that of 712 sworn firefighters, line supervisors and battalion chiefs, there were three women firefighters, 10 African Americans, 11 Hispanics, three Native Americans and two Asians. That means 3.6 percent were members of ethnic minority groups and 0.42 percent were women. Commissioners unanimously approved the ordinance, which included $158,000 for six months.

Hales had help from Fire Chief Robert Wall,  whom he hired  from California specifically to shake up the bureau; Randy Leonard, union president at the time; and William Kendrix, then president of the Portland Black Firefighters’ Association. Kendrix, who retired in 2004, said his organization brought the trainee idea forward, and that ""Commissioner Hales, Randy Leonard and Chief Wall understood that if you wanted to change the numbers, then you had to reach out and provide some community support.""  

Hales said in an interview that he did not seek out the Fire Bureau, but once he inherited it, he made diversity a priority. ""These are issues on which I led,"" he said, adding that ""others on the council were colleagues and supporters.""

Leonard, the former union president,  is now a sitting commissioner who supported current Mayor Sam Adams for re-election until Adams announced he would not run. Leonard told PolitiFact Oregon he brought forward the plan that would eventually become the trainee program. He recalled that all four commissioners and Mayor Vera Katz asked hard questions about cost. And Hales?  

""I would say he certainly wasn’t opposed,"" Leonard said. ""I would not say he led the effort, I would not say he spearheaded the effort, but I would say he was supportive of the effort.""

We also called Gretchen Kafoury, who served on the council in 1994 with Katz and Hales. She doesn’t recall all the facts, or all the maneuvering, but she said: ""Charlie certainly did work to diversify employment in the Fire Bureau. I’m totally confident in that statement."" The heart of the claim is whether the Fire Bureau hired more women and minorities. Here are the numbers: 
**In addition, seven firefighters are biracial/multiracial. 
Hales oversaw the Fire Bureau in 1994 when the City Council approved a trainee program to diversify its ranks. Hales hired a new chief specifically to diversify the bureau. And the numbers started going up. iIn spite of Leonard’s equivocation, we think it’s fair to say that as a member of City Council, Hales ""successfully fought for, and won, adding women and people of color to the Fire Bureau.""

We rate the claim as True.

Jon Huntsman touts record enacting ""flat tax,"" but how accurate is claim?
","
Every Republican candidate claims to be a tax-cutter, but former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman says he's done something that few other Republicans can claim: he simplified the state's income taxes and passed a flat tax.

During a recent house party in Belmont, N.H., Huntsman responded to a voter's question about whether the aim of the federal tax system should be to raise revenue or influence behavior.

""That's one of those trick questions, right?'' Huntsman asked.

""Possibly,'' said Bill Goetz, a retired, manufacturing executive living in Belmont.

Huntsman went on to describe his philosophy and pointed to his record in Utah.

""We got a flat tax out of it, we cut income taxes by 30 percent, it was a cost-neutral affair where we took out the deductions, we took out the biases almost completely, some we didn't get out, and you know what? The state came to life in part because of that.''

Republicans frequently talk a good game about supporting a flat tax, but they often have difficulty getting political support to change the complicated tax laws. So we wondered if Huntsman and the Utah legislature had succeeded in overhauling the state law to the point where it can be considered a flat tax -- and whether they cut income taxes by 30 percent.

The Huntsman campaign pointed us to published reports this spring and in 2007 that explained how Huntsman began pushing for the changes soon after he took office in January 2005.

""We need a tax policy that is not only friendly to our citizens, but also creates a competitive environment for business. Business as usual will leave us behind our neighboring states,"" he said during his first State of the State speech in January 2005.

Huntsman and the Legislature achieved their goal with two changes in tax law over two years.

When Huntsman took office, there were six income tax brackets ranging from 2.3 percent to 7 percent. Ultimately, Huntsman and the Legislature approved a single rate of 5 percent.

They created a much flatter tax, stripping away most of the deductions and credits. Utah taxpayers still adjust their income in ways such as counting interest earned on bond income or deducting from income the withdrawals they make from medical savings accounts.

The research arm of the Utah Legislature maintains it was not a flat tax in the purest sense. ""Although the new system has a single statutory rate of 5.0 percent, it is not a proportional or 'flat' income tax system. Rather, Utah’s new income tax system remains progressive through tax credits,'' said a January 2010 report of the Utah Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel. (A progressive tax system is one in which richer people pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than poorer people do.)

Roughly 90 percent of taxpayers get to claim as a credit from state taxes some of what they claim as deductions and tax exemptions under the federal tax code. The credit phases out and goes away from those making very high incomes in the state.

This makes the effective tax rate about 3 percent for Utah taxpayers earning $70,000 a year in 2008 and 4 percent for a household with $100,000 in taxable income, according to the legislative group's analysis.

""There's no question this is a single rate tax -- but with the credit, the overwhelming majority of taxpayers do not pay 5 percent of their income,'' said Phil Dean, the policy analyst who authored the 2010 study.

Conservative groups give Huntsman high marks for the overhaul and have said they consider it to be a flat tax.

The libertarian Cato Institute gave Huntsman the highest score of any governor on tax policy in 2006. Likewise, the Club for Growth praised Huntsman's tax reform while adding there were some ""minor blemishes""' that included other tax increases during his tenure. (It's worth noting that both groups fault Huntsman for increases in state spending that occurred under his watch.)

In general, most taxpayers ended up paying less in taxes. The Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel estimated that about 97 percent of taxpayers were paying the same or less compared to the 2005 system.

As for Huntsman's claim that they ""cut income taxes by 30 percent,"" we find that is a significant exaggeration.

He is close to correct if you compare the statutory rate in the top tax bracketbefore and after the tax system changed. The top rate declined from 7 percent to 5 percent, which is a decrease of 28.6 percent.

But there are two problems with this measurement. First, it doesn’t address the lower tax brackets. Remember, the lowest rate went up from 2.3 percent to 5 percent. So Huntsman’s 30 percent decrease in the statutory rate didn’t apply to them.

That said, it’s worth noting that residents in the lowest tax brackets didn’t necessarily end up paying more in taxes, because under both approaches they got credits that reduced their tax bill. (In fact, about 97 percent pay the same or less in taxes than they did under the old system.)

Which brings us to the second problem with Huntsman’s 30 percent description -- that just looking at the drop in the statutory rate, as Huntsman does, says very little about how a taxpayer actually fared after the change.

Even after the imposition of the new system, a Utah resident’s tax bill is heavily dependent on their specific circumstances. The 2010 report found that very few taxpayers saved more than $300 on their tax bill, and those who did were mostly in the top 10 percent of earners.

Instead, for the bottom 70 percent of earners, the typical savings was between zero and $200. And a $200 savings for someone earning $55,000 is about four-tenths of 1 percent. That’s a much more modest in-pocket savings than a listener would assume from hearing Huntsman’s 30 percent figure.

""In dollars and cents, for single taxpayers the annual income tax cut worked out to between $25 and $100,'' Dean said. ""Most married taxpayers got a tax cut of $50 to $200.""

Dean added that a cut in the sales tax effectively doubled the overall tax cut for most families. But even that wouldn’t make the savings approach a 30 percent tax-bill reduction for the vast majority of taxpayers.

Our ruling

Huntsman said he passed a flat tax and ""cut income taxes by 30 percent.""

On the flat tax question, the changes under Huntsman certainly made it a flatter tax than the one it replaced, since the changes he oversaw combined several tax brackets into one. But the tax remains more complicated to calculate than a pure flat tax would be. In fact, Utah’s system of tax credits make the tax somewhat progressive in practice, which is something a true flat tax would not be.

Meanwhile, Huntsman’s 30 percent claim is more misleading. It’s true that the statutory rates in the top bracket declined by almost that much, but the actual reduction in tax dollars paid was far smaller for the overwhelming majority of taxpayers -- usually less than 1 percent of a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. We think most people hearing Huntsman's comment would believe he was touting a 30 percent cut in what people actually pay at tax time, and the numbers aren’t close to that. So we rate his claim Mostly False.","[('\nUtah Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel, ""What happened to taxpayers under Utah\'s individual income tax?"" presentation, Jan 26, 2010\n\nCenter for Public Policy and Administration at the University of Utah, analysis of tax law, April 25, 2007\n\nUtah legislative analysis of tax reform, March 2007\n\nTax Foundation, blog post, Sept. 22, 2006\n\nTax Foundation, ""The Facts on Utah\'s Tax Climate""\n\nClub for Growth, 2012 Presidential White Paper on Gov.

Ohio Democratic Party accuses Josh Mandel of endorsing a U.S. default
","
Josh Mandel, who was elected Ohio treasurer last November, has not officially announced he is running for the U.S. Senate next year. But that has not kept the Republican from raising money like a candidate or from collecting endorsements such as that of the Senate Conservatives Fund.

The fund is a political action committee headed by U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina, founder of the Senate’s Tea Party Caucus. The group said it was ""launching an all out SCF surge"" to raise money for Mandel, who ""strongly supports all of the SCF policy goals.""

That drew the attention of the Ohio Democratic Party, which looked at those goals and issued a statement saying that Mandel ""supports allowing the United States to default on its obligations.""

The statement said the ""extreme stand"" puts him in disagreement with Ohio Republicans like Sen. Rob Portman and U.S. House Speaker John Boehner.

PolitiFact Ohio asked for evidence.

Democratic Party spokesman Justin Barasky directed us specifically to a video posted by Ohio Dems and to the endorsement statement of the Senate Conservatives Fund. Barasky said they show Mandel opposes raising the debt limit, ""and by definition (in taking that position) you are endorsing default.""

The 1 minute 43 second video asserts in its first 20 seconds that Mandel supports allowing the U.S. to go into default, citing an email from the Senate Conservatives Fund as the source. The remainder quotes a variety of sources, including Portman and Boehner, on the dangers of default, and quotes President Ronald Reagan from 1985 on the need to raise the federal debt ceiling.

We then looked at the SCF statement. In it, DeMint wrote: ""Sherrod Brown supports raising the debt limit. Mandel opposes it.""

We next called Mandel's spokesman on political matters, Anthony Conchel, to ask about Mandel's position on default.

""I'm not going to respond to that,"" he said, instead providing a quote from Mandel that he said ""mirrors his public comments"" on the matter:

""I am a proud supporter of the 'Cut, Cap and Balance' plan that includes a balanced budget amendment and that passed the House with a bi-partisan vote. If families and small businesses have to tighten their belts and balance their budgets, then government should do the same.""

Finally, we looked at statements of DeMint, a pivotal figure in the discussion.

Shortly before announcing the SCF endorsement of Mandel, DeMint joined nine other Republican senators pledging their opposition to increasing the national debt limit unless Congress cuts spending, enforces spending caps and passes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. He said he would not support any candidate who would not sign such a pledge.

Asked in interviews if that did not make default likely, DeMint said on ABC: ""We'll never default. If it's the last penny we have, we'll pay our bills.""

On NBC, he said, ""It certainly will be disruptive if we continue on the track we're going right now,"" but he dismissed talk of default as ""panic"" stirred to force a deal: ""We are not going to default. We've got enough tax revenue to pay our bills.""

Where does that leave us?

The Ohio Democrats argue that failing to raise the debt limit will inevitably lead to default. And they say the SCF’s opposition to raising the debt ceiling, opposition the SCF says Mandel shares, amounts to an endorsement of default.

But there’s some problems with that line of thinking.

Opposition to raising the federal debt ceiling is not the same as actively endorsing the idea of the United States defaulting on its obligations. Protest votes opposing previous debt ceiling increases were common from both parties. But that doesn’t mean they were advocating default.

No where in a list of policy goals the SCF has posted on its website is there any mention of support for default. And DeMint argues it won’t happen, describing talk of default as ""panic"" stirred to force a debt ceiling deal. Again, correct or incorrect, DeMint is not advocating default.

DeMint himself has said he would support legislation to increase the debt ceiling if it followed provisions in his Cut-Cap-Balance Pledge; substantially cut current spending, cap future spending and require the passage of a strong Balanced Budget Amendment before raising the debt limit. Mandel has endorsed that plan. However unlikely it is that those provisions would gain passage in Congress, it’s far from endorsing default.

But perhaps most importly, while declaring Mandel endorses default, the Ohio Democrats don’t rely on Mandel’s words at all. Their cited source was information DeMint and the SCF stated about Mandel.

We find the Ohio Democratic Party’s claim isn’t just inaccurate, it’s also ridiculous.

On the Truth-O-Meter there’s just one ruling for that kind of statement: Pants on Fire.","[('\nOhio Democrats, ""Josh Mandel Endorses U.S. Default,"" July 25, 2011\n\nInterview with Democratic spokesman Justin Barasky, July 25, 2011\n\nOhioDems, ""Extremely Wrong"" video, July 25, 2011\n\nUSA Today, ""Sen.

Tim Pawlenty said Michele Bachmann's legislative record is 'failed amendments'
","
It's not every state that has two candidates running for president, but this year Minnesota has both Tim Pawlenty and Michele Bachmann competing for the Republican nomination. But the state's ""Minnesota nice"" reputation doesn't seem to apply to presidential politics. 

Bachmann, a member of Congress, has been attacking Pawlenty, a former two-term governor, for not being conservative enough. Pawlenty, meanwhile, has said Bachmann has few legislative accomplishments and wasn't known for getting results.

We checked part of Bachmann's attack in separate fact-check. She accused Pawlenty of saying in 2006 that ""The era of small government is over... the government has to be more proactive and more aggressive."" We looked into the history of Pawlenty's comments and rated her statement Mostly True. 

Here, we're looking at Pawlenty's response. He said that while he was ""elected twice in a very blue state, Congresswoman Bachmann was giving speeches and offering failed amendments,"" among other things. Pawlenty also said in an interview on July 10, 2011, that Bachmann's ""record of accomplishment in Congress is nonexistent.""

Here, we wanted to check Pawlenty's statement about Bachmann's record of accomplishment. Is it as thin as he suggests? 
To check, we turned to the federal legislative database THOMAS, media accounts and other public records. We found Pawlenty was largely correct: Bachmann does not have many legislative victories under her belt.

Instead, Bachmann seems to prefer offering legislation that makes a bold statement. This year, she proposed making the Bush tax cuts permanent, stripping President Barack Obama's health care law of funding, overturning new energy efficiency standards for light bulbs and repealing the financial regulatory overhaul that passed just last year. None of those bills has received a vote from the full U.S. House of Representatives. 

Bachmann has served in Congress since 2006, and hasn't sponsored anything that's become law. Her most successful proposals were a 2008 resolution expressing support for agencies that provide services to foster children and a 2009 resolution to designate September as ""National Hydrocephalus Awareness Month"". (Hydrocephalus is a buildup of fluid inside the skull, leading to brain swelling, which can be fatal.) Both measures were approved by the House but not the Senate.

We went looking for other accounts to either confirm or refute Pawlenty's charge. (We contacted Bachmann's campaign for comment and didn't hear back.) We knew from previous reporting that sometimes a legislator's bill is incorporated into other larger legislation with a different sponsor. We wanted to make sure were weren't missing giving Bachmann credit for a case like this.

Instead, we found more confirmation that her legislative record is thin. 

Here's how POLITICO summarized its review of her record: ""Now in her third House term, Bachmann has never had a bill or resolution she's sponsored signed into law, and she's never wielded a committee gavel, either at the full or subcommittee level. Bachmann's amendments and bills have rarely been considered by any committee, even with the House under GOP control. In a chamber that rewards substantive policy work and insider maneuvering, Bachmann has shunned the inside game, choosing to be more of a bomb thrower than a legislator.""

MinnPost.com, a nonpartisan Minnesota-based news website, concluded: ""She has had a few amendments passed, among the most famous of which aimed to prevent groups like ACORN from sitting on a proposed consumer advisory panel on financial protection and making them ineligible for certain federal grants. But most of her legislation, like her health-care reform bill that would make all health care costs tax deductible and allow the purchase of insurance across state lines, has been introduced and referred to committee, never to be heard from again.""

In February 2010, the St. Cloud Times newspaper of Minnesota asked Bachmann about her legislative achievements. Here's the question and her response:

St. Cloud Times: ""Name three bills or amendments that you have gotten passed that are the most beneficial to the people of the 6th Congressional District.""

Bachmann: ""I was involved in a foster care amendment to support and encourage people in foster care. It is a very important issue. Sen. Mary Landrieu, (D-La.) and I are working on the Haiti situation. We are trying to put together initiatives so that children can actually go into homes and not stay in institutions their whole life. I was able to pass this resolution honoring people in foster care. I am in the deep minority in Congress and a fairly new freshman, so I don't have substantive bills that I have passed. I would love to. The very first bill I introduced was the Health Care Freedom of Choice Act.""

We should note that Bachmann's point about being in the minority has some merit. It's often difficult if not impossible for legislators in the minority to get bills passed. But Republicans did regained the majority this year. Also, she's right that new members of Congress often don't get legislation passed, though Bachmann was in her second term when she made her comments to the St. Cloud Times. 

But even Bachmann supporters seem to admit that passing legislation isn't really her thing. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, told POLITICO that Bachmann has had ""a profound effect on the debate,"" comparing her with Winston Churchill. ""It doesn't mean you always win. In fact, as we know, Churchill lost and lost and was a voice of reason in Great Britain for a long time before people finally realized he was right,"" Gohmert said.

Finally, we checked in with two political watchers in Minnesota to see if we were missing anything from Bachmann's record.

""Pawlenty more or less got it correct in terms of saying her legislative record is insubstantial. She has never been known for doing real legislative work or in really moving legislation. She is better at giving speeches,"" said David Schultz, a professor at Hamline University who studies Minnesota politics.

And though Bachamnn was in the legislative minority for a time in Congress, Schultz said, she never chose to create a legislative record. ""Thus, it did not surprise me that once this year she became part of a majority in the House, she opted to run for president. I do not think she was prepared actually to govern and do real legislative work."" 

Steve Schier, a professor of political science at Carleton College, said that Bachmann ""has defined herself during her political career as a public advocate, not an executive or legislator. Her goal has been to draw bright rhetorical lines and marshal support for her purist conservative positions.""

In ruling on Pawlenty's statement, he said that Bachmann's record was one of ""failed amendments"" and ""nonexistent."" There's a little bit of exaggeration there. In addition to failed amendments, she had failed bills, and those measures did, in fact, exist, even if they didn't pass. But his larger point that Bachmann hasn't had many legislative accomplishments is correct. We rate his statement Mostly True. ","[('\nPolitico,\xa0Michele Bachmann launches scathing attack on Tim Pawlenty, July 24, 2011\n\nPolitico,\xa0Bachmann camp: Pawlenty equals Obama, July 24, 2011\n\nTHOMAS, H.RES.789,\xa0Honoring public child welfare agencies, nonprofit organizations and private entities providing services for foster children, approved May 14, 2008\n\nTHOMAS, H.RES.373,\xa0Expressing support for designation of the month of September as ""National Hydrocephalus Awareness Month"", approved July 29, 2009', 'http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0711/59770.html')]",/factchecks/2011/jul/28/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-said-michele-bachmanns-legislative-re/
"['Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Republican Party of Wisconsin']","
Wisconsin Republican Party says more than half the nation's job growth in June came from Wisconsin
","
Gov. Scott Walker says he is focused like a laser beam on job creation. He’s promised that Wisconsin will create 250,000 private sector jobs during his four year term.

So when a monthly report showed a sharp increase in the number of jobs in June 2011 -- an estimated net increase of 12,900 jobs, or 9,500 if you just consider the private sector -- it got some attention. What’s more, a federal Bureau of Labor Statistics report released earlier in July showed there had been only 18,000 jobs created nationwide in June.

(To be sure, the news was not all rosy in the state report: It showed the unemployment rate rose to 7.6 percent in June, from 7.4 percent in May.)

Walker celebrated the Wisconsin jobs numbers on July 21, 2011, with this tweet:  ""In June, there were 18,000 net new jobs in America. In WI, there were 9,500 net new jobs!  most since 9/2003.""

Walker made a similar comparison in an interview: ""To have 9,500 net new jobs in the state at a time when the country saw just 18,000 net new jobs all across the country is incredibly good news, and it's driven by the rebirth of tourism in the state.""

Many others echoed the basic message of Walker’s tweet, often adding their own spin. And that’s where numbers -- or at least the use of them -- started to go bad.

The state Republican Party issued a news release with this statement: ""Today, we learned that over 50 percent of U.S. job growth in June came from our state.""

Three days later, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) said: ""The labor (department) report that came out last week had 18,000 jobs created in the country. But half of them were in Wisconsin, so we must be doing something right.""

Variations of the statement were made by others, including the conservative MacIver Institute, Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills), and state Reps. Michelle Litjens (R-Vinland), Scott Suder (R-Abbotsford) and Joan Ballweg (R-Markesan).

That’s a lot of echoes.

But is what’s being shouted accurate? That is, is the state-national comparison a valid one?

We started by looking at the other state-by-state reports, released by the federal government at the same time Wisconsin’s numbers were issued.

Wisconsin wasn’t at the top.

That claim belonged to Texas, with an increase of 32,000 jobs. Numerous other states showed larger job gains than Wisconsin. For instance, California was up 28,800, and our neighbor Minnesota topped Wisconsin with an increase of 13,200 jobs.

Obviously, those add up to more than 18,000 jobs added in the country in June. Indeed, if you were to tally all the state reports -- accounting for those with increases and decreases -- you’d wind up with a net monthly increase of 64,900 jobs -- not the originally discussed 18,000. And half of them would have been created in Texas.

So, could Texas Gov. Rick Perry accurately claim his state accounted for twice the total of all the jobs created in the nation? That’s illogical at best.

What’s going on here?

In short, Walker, the state GOP and the others touting the national numbers are making a flawed comparison. The Bureau of Labor Statistics does separate national and state-by-state studies, each with different parameters and margins of error. The agency says it’s wrong to mix the two estimates -- a warning included as a footnote on the documents themselves.

Here’s how they put it:

""State estimation procedures are designed to produce accurate data for each individual state. (The bureau) independently develops the national employment series and does not force state estimates to sum to national totals nor vice versa.

""Because each state series is subject to larger sampling and nonsampling errors than the national series, summing them cumulates individual state levels errors and can cause significant distortions at an aggregate level. Due to these statistical limitations, (the bureau) does not compile a ‘sum of states’ employment series and cautions users that such a series is subject to a relatively large and volatile error structure.""

In short, the bureau says you can’t accurately use the individual state jobs reports to make a national comparison. Or even shorter: Don’t do it.

Walker addressed the flawed comparisons a few days after the jobs report was released, during a July 26, 2011 appearance in Wausau.

""We made it very clear at our announcement that (our number) was not half of all the jobs out there, though it is an interesting parallel,"" Walker said.

In looking back at the various statements, some clearly went further than others -- and further than Walker’s original tweet. Many of the strongest comparisons seem to take the lead from the state GOP, which claimed ""over 50 percent of U.S. job growth in June came from our state.""

As the Bureau of Labor Statistics notes, it is wrong to combine the two sets of numbers to reach this conclusion. After all, by that approach Minnesota, California and Texas could all say the same as the state GOP, which would lead to at least four halves and, apparently, two wholes.

This item isn’t on whether the jobs news was good -- clearly it was -- but on how it was presented.

Michael Burgess says stores will be barred from selling 100-watt bulbs in 2012
","
Earlier this month, the U.S. House approved a Texas congressman’s proposal to block federal funding to enforce an existing law affecting the kinds of light bulbs made in the United States, as the Houston Chronicle reported.

The amendment’s sponsor, Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Lewisville, critiqued the 2007 law he was targeting in a July 15 statement. ""Starting Jan. 1,"" Burgess said, ""if Home Depot or your local grocery store has the 100-watt bulb in their inventory, they will not be allowed to sell them. That means they will take all 100-watt bulbs off the shelf, and they will never see the consumer. My amendment will allow the stores to continue to sell what they have in stock.""

Elaborating, Burgess said the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 bars 100-watt bulbs from being sold after the start of the year.

Turn out the lights. Are 100-watt bulbs really banned?

In his statement, Burgess said a subtitle of the act, ""Lighting Energy Efficiency,"" is at fault. We read it and did not spot a ban on the sale of 100-watt bulbs. However, the law requires manufacturers to make all light bulbs more energy efficient.

Whitney Thompson, Burgess’ communications director, told us by email that the average 100-watt bulb puts out an average of 1700 lumens, or light output, and the 2007 act states that as of January, a bulb putting out 1700 lumens must be capped at 72 watts — which, she said, amounts to a ban on selling 100-watt bulbs.

""It might give off as much light, but the light it gives off is different,"" Thompson said. ""Plug a 72-watt bulb in next to a 100-watt bulb and compare the two. People want the 100-watt bulb, not the 72-watt — and the government should not take that choice away.""

Specifically, the act states that as of 2012, ""general service incandescent lamps"" putting out 1490 to 2600 lumens can require no more than 72 watts. Also, it says, such bulbs must have a minimum lifetime of 1,000 hours. According to information posted online by the U.S. Department of Energy, the act limits the import or manufacture of inefficient bulbs, but stores will be able to sell remaining inventory.

Some background: The act, signed into law by President George W. Bush, imposed lumens and wattage requirements on incandescent bulbs, which had wasted most of their energy in heat. Critics of the law, including Texas Gov. Rick Perry, say the act directs which light bulbs consumers can use — a claim we rated Barely True last year. There is no restriction on which bulbs consumers use, though the standards are expected to result in people purchasing and using different bulbs.

Under the law, bulbs providing the comparable light output of a traditional 100-watt bulb may use no more than 72 watts of electricity. Also, 75-watt, 60-watt and 40-watt bulbs must be replaced by bulbs using no more than 53, 43 and 29 watts, respectively, in ensuing years.

The energy department says in an online post that if you are replacing a 100-watt bulb, a ""good rule of thumb is to look for a bulb that gives you about 1600 lumens. Your new bulb should provide that level of brightness for no more than 72 watts, cutting your energy bill.""

PolitiFact National noted in May that traditional versions of incandescent light bulbs do not meet the new standards and will be phased out of existence with compact fluorescent and LED bulbs offering more efficient alternatives.

Then again, major bulb makers are now selling a new generation of incandescent bulbs that meet the efficiency standards.

Philips Electronics’ EcoVantage bulb is a halogen incandescent light bulb that runs on 72 watts but throws off as much light as a standard 100-watt bulb. Two other industry players, Osram Sylvania and GE, have developed halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the efficiency standards.

Upshot: As of January, traditional incandescent 100-watt bulbs won’t be made, though stores can continue to sell existing stocks. Also, more efficient bulbs generating the same level of light will be available; they already are. We rate this statement Mostly False.","[('\nPolitiFact, fact check, ""Conservative PAC claims Democrats banned incandescent light bulbs in favor of fluorescent light bulbs,"" May 20, 2011', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/20/ameripac/conservative-pac-claims-democrats-banned-incandesc/')]",/factchecks/2011/jul/28/michael-burgess/michael-burgess-says-stores-will-be-barred-selling/
"['New Jersey', 'Deficit', 'Leonard Lance']","
U.S. Rep. Leonard Lance says government debt has grown by $3.4 trillion during the first 29 months of the Obama administration
","
Rep. Leonard Lance recently criticized the Washington establishment for spending the nation into a fiscal crisis.

In a July 17 column, Lance (R-7th Dist.) blamed both sides of the political aisle for driving up government debt , but also singled out President Barack Obama.

""Recently we have seen our government debt grow by $3.4 trillion during the first 29 months of the Obama administration -- the equivalent of about $4 billion per day,""  Lance wrote in the column published on CourierPostOnline.com.

PolitiFact New Jersey checked whether government debt has increased that much since Obama took office -- and whether the president is responsible. We found Lance’s statistics are correct, but Obama’s role in debt growth is more difficult to pin down.

There are two types of government debt: one includes debt held by the public and the other includes debt held directly by the government, such as in trust funds for Social Security and Medicare. Collectively, those two types of debt make up gross national debt.

Lance’s spokeswoman, Angie Lundberg, said the congressman was referring to debt held by the public.

Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009. From then until July 15 -- the most recent data available at the time Lance made his statement -- publicly held debt increased more than $3.4 trillion, from more than $6.3 trillion to more than $9.75 trillion, according to U.S. Treasury Department data.

That’s a $3.75 billion increase per day. Round up and it’s ""the equivalent of about $4 billion per day.""

So, Lance had his numbers right. But is Obama responsible for that increase?

Lundberg said Lance didn’t ""lay blame on how we acquired that debt, just stated the fact."" But Lance highlighted the debt growth during Obama’s tenure, so we’ll look at how much the president is at fault.

Let’s note that when Obama took office he inherited all the debt accumulated by his predecessor, President George W. Bush.

An April report by the nonpartisan Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative analyzed the difference in the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s projections of publicly held debt and the actual debt from 2001 to 2011. The report found that about two-thirds of debt growth -- expressed as a percentage of the gross domestic product -- during that time resulted from new legislation, some of which was enacted under Bush.

The report said the Bush tax cuts, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the 2009 stimulus are three of the five ""most significant legislative drivers"" of the debt, but also notes that ""no single policy or piece of legislation, however, is overwhelmingly responsible"" for the increase.

We also spoke with five experts from different Washington, D.C.-think tanks. The general consensus was that while Obama can’t be saddled with all of the growth in debt since taking office, he is responsible for some of the increase.

Michael Linden, director for tax and budget policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, argued that the debt attributable to Obama would be the amount accrued from legislation Obama signed, including: the stimulus package, extension of the Bush tax cuts -- though he notes that was a bipartisan deal -- and his budgets.

""It’s difficult to tease out exactly how much"" that’d account for, Linden said, ""but it’s definitely not the whole $3.4 trillion.""

Kevin Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said Obama’s policies are to blame for most of the change in spending that contributed to debt growth, but not most of the change in revenues. Assigning blame for either entirely to the president would be wrong, he said.

Isabel Sawhill, a budget expert with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution said Obama and factors outside his control are to blame for rising debt. ""Obama’s actions to fight the financial crisis and the recession did add to the deficits and debt but are not the major culprits,"" she said in an email, citing ""a persistent gap between spending and revenues, largely because of the aging population and the growing cost of health care.""

Marc Goldwein, policy director of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, highlighted some legislation Obama signed that added to the debt, but said the economy is a factor.

Let’s review.

Lance correctly stated that government debt held by the public grew by $3.4 trillion during Obama’s tenure.

But experts said that while Obama can be blamed for some of that increase, he isn’t responsible for it all.
