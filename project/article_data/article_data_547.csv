Fact-check: Donald Trump says Germany owes 'vast sums of money to NATO'
","Less than 24 hours after meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to criticize Germany for shirking on its defense payments to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United States. ""Despite what you have heard from the FAKE NEWS, I had a GREAT meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel,"" Trump wrote in a tweet March 18. ""Nevertheless, Germany owes vast sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!"" Despite what you have heard from the FAKE NEWS, I had a GREAT meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Nevertheless, Germany owes..... ...vast sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany! Trump has repeatedly called on NATO countries to contribute more to that military alliance, so we decided to fact-check his claim about Germany. What we found is that Trump is misunderstanding how NATO’s joint defense is paid for, and that Germany doesn’t owe anything. ‘Germany owes vast sums of money to NATO’ NATO, formally the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was created in 1949 to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. Currently, 28 countries (including the United States and Germany) are members. The members agreed that ""an armed attack against one or more of them … shall be considered an attack against them all"" and that following such an attack, each member would take ""such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force."" We never heard back from Trump’s team about what money Germany owes. But Trump likely was alluding to the fact Germany has not yet met the NATO target commitment for overall defense funding. As of 2014, NATO’s collective agreement directed members to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense spending by 2024. According to NATO, only five counties meet that obligation today: the United States, Greece, Estonia, Poland and the United Kingdom.   As you can see from the graphic above, Germany only pays 1.2 percent of their GDP on defense spending. German leaders have said they intend to boost military spending. The problem with Trump’s claim, however, is that Germany doesn’t pay that money to NATO or the United States or any other country, said Daniel Benjamin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""(Germany) has, like many members, fallen short of its commitments, which is obviously not good,"" Benjamin said. ""But there is no central bank this money goes into, and there is no transaction."" Other experts we consulted agreed. The United States decides what level of military spending it wants to have, as do all other NATO  members. ""The relatively low levels of military spending among U.S. allies is completely rational,"" said Christopher Preble, the vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. ""They don't see a pressing need to spend more."" Trump’s argument that the United States needs to be paid more also misrepresents how NATO works, experts told us. ""Trump seems to represent the NATO alliance as a licensing deal — one in which countries like Germany pay the United States for its power and influence,"" said Laicie Heeley, a military budget expert at the Stimson Center, a defense policy think tank. ""This is not the case."" The United States does provide an outsized military commitment to NATO, but this is not done as a favor for Europe; it’s done to benefit all countries in the alliance, experts said. And the United States has several high-profile military bases in Germany that are vital, serving as a key launching point for attacks against terrorists in the Middle East. Our ruling Trump said Germany ""owes vast sums of money to NATO"" and the United States ""must be paid more"" for the defense it provides to Germany. NATO members agreed to spend 2 percent of their country’s GDP on defense by 2024. But that’s not in payments to NATO. Each country funds its own defense, while NATO serves as an umbrella organization meant to protect all members. Experts say Trump is mistaken.

Sen. McCaskill right about small business job creation
","There has been controversy surrounding several of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks. Notable selections, such as Betsy DeVos, Rex Tillerson and Jeff Sessions, have drawn the ire of Democrats and even a few Republicans. One choice that didn’t receive much criticism was the appointment of Linda McMahon as administrator of the Small Business Administration. McMahon was approved by an 81-19 vote by the Senate, one of the more lopsided approvals of Trump’s Cabinet positions. In that same press release, though, McCaskill said something that caught our eye. She said: ""Small businesses — which create two out of every three American jobs — are an engine for job growth that we’ve got to support and sustain."" The first part of that statement stuck out to us. What’s defined as a small business? Do small businesses really produce that many jobs? We decided to do some digging into McCaskill’s claim. What’s a small business? When you think of small businesses, you usually think of ""mom and pop"" shops that are locally owned and have a few employees. However, the government’s definition of small business is any business that employs fewer than 500 people. According to a 2016 newsletter published by the Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy, as of 2013, there were 28.8 million small businesses in the United States. That 28.8 million made up 99.7 percent of the businesses in the U.S. and provided 56.8 million jobs for U.S. workers. Having nearly 29 million small businesses in the country provides a very strong economic impact. In the United States, 54 percent of all sales come from small businesses. 97.7 percent of all U.S. trade exporters are also small business owners, making small business a key fixture of the United States economy. How many jobs do small businesses create? While all of the numbers listed above are important in understanding the impact of small businesses, it doesn’t answer our question about the accuracy of McCaskill’s claim. When we asked McCaskill press secretary Sarah Feldman where the senator got her numbers, she directed us to a 2011 report on the state of small businesses. In it, the report says that small businesses have ""created 64 percent of new American private sector jobs generated in the past 15 years — that’s 40 million net new jobs according to the Council of Economic Advisers."" That report was from six years ago. We wanted to see if there were any current reports on small businesses in the United States. Luckily, the Small Business Administration posted an article breaking down recent small business trends. It states that ""small businesses provide 55 percent of all jobs and 66 percent of all net new jobs since the 1970s."" This backs McCaskill’s claim that two out of every three American jobs are created by small businesses. An important thing to point out Something to note, though, is that just because two out of every three new jobs is created by a small business, that doesn’t mean 66 percent of the U.S. workforce is employed by small business. As stated above, 55 percent of U.S. workers are employed by small businesses. While this is an increase from 48 percent in 2013, small business employment still does not represent two-thirds of the workforce in America. This is important to differentiate because McCaskill’s statement could be misinterpreted to say that. She is strictly talking about the creation of jobs, not the overall amount of small business jobs in the country. Our ruling Upon the approval of McMahon as administrator to the Small Business Administration, senator McCaskill release a press release that said, in part, ""Small businesses — which create two out of every three American jobs—are an engine for job growth that we’ve got to support and sustain."" While two-thirds of the workforce is not employed by small businesses, 66 percent of net new jobs since the 1970s have been created by small businesses. And though McCaskill’s statement could be interpreted differently, her statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. We rate this statement True.",/factchecks/2017/mar/18/claire-mccaskill/sen-mccaskill-right-about-small-business-job-creat/

Cuomo's budget does not include new tax cuts
","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo says tax rates will drop for the middle class as long as they remain high for the rich. As state budget talks begin to heat up, that is his pitch for extending what’s called the millionaires’ tax - an 8.82 percent income tax on those earning more than $1 million annually. That rate will fall to 6.85 percent if the tax is not extended. The additional tax bracket was created under former Gov. David Paterson and then extended by Cuomo and the Legislature in 2013. It's due to sunset at the end of this year. But Cuomo wants to extend it for another three years. In return, he promises lower taxes for the middle class.  ""We want to start right out of the box by doing an additional tax cut for the middle class because the best thing we can say to our middle-class brothers and sisters is, 'You know what, government is going to take less of your paycheck every week.' ""  Critics say Cuomo is misleading the public. They say the tax cuts Cuomo is talking about were already passed in last year’s budget. Those rates are scheduled to be the lowest in 70 years when phased in. ""Senate says drop the millionaires’ tax. Assembly says raise the millionaires’ tax. I say, continue it as is,"" Cuomo said. ""I also propose in my budget a middle income tax cut. But if you allow the millionaires’ tax to expire, that $3.5 billion loss of revenue devastates the budget. And forget all the proposals."" So, which is it? Are there new tax cuts in Cuomo’s budget, or were they already passed last year? A promise or threat? It is true that state tax rates for the middle class are slated to go down. Last year's budget included tax cuts for married filers making between $27,750 and $321,050, as well as for single filers making between $13,850 and $214,000. The cuts are scheduled to be phased in from 2018 through 2025.   But Cuomo’s proposed budget legislation doesn't contain any additional cuts. It extends the millionaires' tax through 2020. A Cuomo administration spokesman says that still counts as a tax cut this year. Without an extension of the millionaires’ tax, last year's cuts could be amended or eliminated to balance the books, the spokesman said. ""That’s not the governor fighting for a middle-class tax cut. That’s the governor threatening to take away a middle-class tax cut,"" said Ken Girardin of the Empire Center for Public Policy, a non-partisan, non-profit think tank based in Albany that calls for policy reforms based on free-market principles, personal responsibility and effective and accountable government. Cuomo’s budget proposal won’t change anything for the middle class compared to last year’s agreement, Girardin said. ""The legislature could take a one-year hiatus to Saint Lucia and middle-class tax rates would still go down,"" Girardin said. Our ruling Cuomo said he’s proposing ""an additional tax cut for the middle class"" in this year’s budget. The tax rates in Cuomo’s proposed budget are not new. They were approved in last year’s budget but are not scheduled to begin until 2018. Middle-class tax rates will decline as scheduled if lawmakers leave them alone. Granted, everything is up for negotiation in a state budget, including tax rates. Legislative leaders could agree to change tax rates as part of this year’s spending plan. But Cuomo’s statement ignores facts and gives a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/mar/17/andrew-cuomo/cuomos-budget-does-not-include-new-tax-cuts/

Nothing inflated in Arnold Schwarzenegger's claim on gerrymandering
","Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger won’t be back to host The New Celebrity Apprentice.  He also recently squashed rumors he might run for U.S. Senate. That doesn’t mean, however, that the bodybuilder-turned-movie-star-turned-politician plans to fade quietly into the Hollywood sunset.  Schwarzenegger’s next adventure is tackling what he calls America’s rigged political redistricting system. ""Gerrymandering has created an absurd reality where politicians now pick their voters instead of the voters picking their politicians,"" Schwarzenegger, a Republican, said in a recent video. He cites reforms in California as a model for the nation: In 2008, voters in the state approved a bipartisan Citizens Redistricting Commission, which has been credited for drawing district boundaries in a way that’s made some state and congressional races more competitive. Schwarzenegger made a claim on Twitter and Facebook about just how lopsided congressional races have become nationwide:  ""The average margin of victory in the House of Representatives was 37%,"" he said on Twitter on Feb. 23, 2017, referring to the average percentage point victory for both Democrats and Republicans in the 2016 election. ""There are dictators who win by less.""  Given Schwarzenegger’s new focus, we decided to see whether his claim about margin of victory in House races is correct -- or all pumped up. Our fact check focused on his 37 percent figure. Our research We asked Schwarzenegger’s spokesman for evidence. He cited a breakdown of the 2016 election on the website ballotpedia.org. It’s an independent, online encyclopedia of American politics and elections. And, indeed, it lists the average margin of victory for members of the House at 37.1 percent. It notes that’s up from the 35.8 percent margin in 2014. We checked with one more knowledgeable source: Jack Pitney, a longtime professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College and former director of the Republican National Committee’s Research Department. Pitney crunched last year’s election numbers for us and found a 39 percent margin of victory for House members. He said he wasn’t sure what accounted for the slight difference in his findings. ""But the bottom line is that Arnold's point -- House members win by big margins -- is essentially correct,"" Pitney said. What accounts for that huge margin? Pitney said part of it is deliberate gerrymandering, and part is that ""constituencies are increasingly polarized."" ""Even in states where you don’t have a partisan (redistricting) process, Democrats tend to live in certain places. Republicans tend to live in others,"" the professor added. Supporters of California’s redistricting commission say it’s created more competitive districts. As an example, some cite California's 49th Congressional District, where incumbent Republican Darrell Issa defeated Democrat Douglas Applegate by 0.5 percent of the vote -- the smallest margin of any House race in the nation. Issa, who’s been in Congress since 2000, has won his district by 20 or even 30 percentage points in previous elections. But as the Washington Post reported in December 2016, the commission hasn’t led to changes in party control in any of California’s 53 congressional districts for several election cycles: ""For the fourth time in 12 years, not a single one of the state's 50-plus congressional districts switched parties. Just as in 2010, 2008 and 2004, every single seat returned to the party that previously controlled it,"" the Post reported on Dec. 1, 2016, adding that ""competitiveness has only ticked up slightly (in California’s congressional districts) under the new map."" We asked Pitney how well the commission has performed: ""There’s a debate about that,"" he told us. ""Some argue that what appeared to be a nonpartisan process was actually gamed by Democrats. Be that as it may, the real reason for Democratic dominance in congressional elections is there’s just a lot more Democrats in California than there are Republicans. The state’s been trending heavily Democratic for years."" About those dictators Schwarzenegger also mentioned the electoral margins for dictators. That's not part of this fact-check but we thought it would be fun to check their margins, too. In 2014, BBC News examined this topic in its article ""The world of 100% election victories."" Here’s what it found: -- North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un was elected in 2014 by the communist republic’s parliament with 100% votes -- Former North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il fared almost as well as his son in 2009, winning 99.9 % of votes -- Former Iraq President Saddam Hussein also won 100% votes in a 2002 referendum -- Cuban President Raúl Castro earned 99.4% votes in his 2008 election -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad secured 97.6% votes for his 2007 presidential referendum. Our ruling Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger recently claimed the  ""average margin of victory in the House of Representatives was 37%"" among Republicans and Democrats during last year’s election. That claim is supported by the 37.1 percent margin calculated by independent election tracker ballotpedia.org and longtime politics professor Jack Pitney of Claremont McKenna College, who put the margin slightly higher at 39 percent.

Attacking Republicans, Democratic state senator says Wisconsin among most gerrymandered states
","A federal court has ruled that boundaries drawn by Wisconsin Republicans in 2011 for state legislative districts were so excessively partisan as to be unconstitutional. Two months later, in January 2017, the three-judge panel ordered Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature to redraw the districts (the state is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court). Understandably, Democrats have cried foul. One of them, state Sen. Dave Hansen of Green Bay, went so far as to declare in a March 5, 2017 TV interview: ""We are the most -- if not Number 1, Number 2 -- gerrymandered state in the country."" Is he right? The court case Boundaries for the state Assembly and state Senate (as well as for Wisconsin’s congressional districts) are redrawn every 10 years -- by the state Legislature itself, which can lead to problems. As the Harvard Political Review has observed generally about redistricting, which is done by the legislature in most states: ""Allowing partisan legislators to redraw their own districts creates a clear conflict of interest, and historically the temptation to game the system has proven too great to resist for the majority party."" The federal court said the Wisconsin state legislative maps drawn in 2011 by Republicans were among the most heavily skewed to one party of any plan in the country going back more than 40 years. One of the goals, the court concluded, ""was to secure Republican control of the Assembly under any likely future electoral scenario for the remainder of the decade, in other words to entrench the Republican Party in power."" The Washington Post’s ""The Fix"" blog called Wisconsin one of the most gerrymandered states in the nation, noting that in 2012, Democratic candidates for the state Assembly received more votes than Republicans, but won just 39 of 99 districts. The blog said the court’s ruling was the first time in a decade that a court has thrown out legislative maps because they favored voters of one party over another. The new boundaries have been reflected in election results. As Craig Gilbert, author of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Wisconsin Voter blog, has reported: 2012: Republicans got only 46 percent of the presidential vote in Wisconsin, but won 60 percent of the seats in the state Assembly. 2014: Republicans got just over 52 percent of the vote for governor, but captured 63 percent of the Assembly seats. 2016: Donald Trump won 50.4 percent of the vote for president, but won 64 percent of the Assembly seats. Viewed another way, according to political scientists at Binghamton University: Wisconsin Democrats probably have to win about 55 to 56 percent of the statewide vote to win control of the state Assembly, while Republicans need only win 44 to 45 percent. And Theodore Arrington, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, agreed that depending on how gerrymandering is measured, Wisconsin is among the worst states. So, the Wisconsin state legislative maps stand as an outlier. How Wisconsin compares to others isn’t a precise calculation, but it stands out in that way, too. Ranking states To back Hansen’s claim, his office pointed us to a column that reported on a 2015 study by Simon Jackman, who at the time was a political science professor at Stanford University. (He is now CEO of the US Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.) Jackman was hired by the plaintiffs in the federal court case. He studied 41 states, not all 50, and ranked Wisconsin’s map as the fifth-worst: North Carolina Virginia Michigan Florida Wisconsin Wisconsin ranked higher, however, in a 2014 study we found that was led by University of Chicago law professor and redistricting expert Nicholas Stephanopoulos: Wyoming Wisconsin Oklahoma Virginia Florida Both studies used a measure called the ""efficiency gap,"" a number that is arrived at through an equation. That is, the difference between each party's ""wasted"" votes in an election -- where votes are wasted if they are cast for a losing candidate, or for a winning candidate but in excess of what the candidate needed to win -- divided by the total number of votes cast. Stephanopoulos told us Wisconsin’s ranking differs in the two studies because the studies treated uncontested races differently. But whether Wisconsin ranks fifth or second ""is just a matter of a percentage point or two, and is substantively irrelevant,"" he said. There are some caveats, though, as other redistricting experts noted. Charles Hampton, an emeritus professor of mathematical sciences at Wooster College in Ohio, said he thought the second study was too dependent on vote totals in its analysis and not on the redistricting plan itself. Michael Li, who is senior counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice Democracy Program at New York University School of Law, told us the ""partisan biases"" found in the studies can be largely but not completely explained by gerrymandering. But he said political geography -- for example, Democrats tending to live in big cities -- also explains some of the disparity in Wisconsin. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who maintains a website on redistricting, cautioned that ""there are no universally agreed-upon rankings, in part because gerrymandering usually describes an unfair drawing of the lines, and there's no universally agreed-upon sense of what's fair, or what's fair for what purposes."" Our rating Hansen says Wisconsin is ""the most -- if not Number 1, Number 2 -- gerrymandered state in the country"" for state legislative boundaries. A federal court has said maps drawn in 2011 by Wisconsin Republicans were among the most heavily skewed to one party of any plan in the country going back more than 40 years. And, with the caveat that there isn’t a universally accepted definition of gerrymander, two studies put Wisconsin at or near the top.

Public school advocates say no voucher bills have passed in Texas Legislature
","Near the start of this year’s legislative session, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick stood on the Capitol’s steps and exhorted lawmakers in the House and Senate to vote on ""school choice"" legislation, saying it’s ""it's easy to kill a bill when no one gets to vote on it."" An advocacy group opposed to public funds supporting students going to private and religious schools urged a different course. In a Jan. 23, 2017, press release, the Coalition for Public Schools, which says it represents religious, child advocacy and education organizations, urged the Legislature to ""focus its efforts on providing support for our neighborhood public schools instead of funneling public tax dollars"" to private school ""voucher schemes with little or no accountability for how our tax dollars are spent."" The eight-paragraph release closed with a historical claim: ""Texas legislators have filed voucher proposals in every legislative session since 1995, but all of them have failed to become law."" That’d be a big 0-for-10 for voucher proponents because state lawmakers convene in regular session every odd-numbered year. We decided to check the record. For starters, we knew that Texans in 2017 can’t access government-backed vouchers to attend nonpublic schools. Nationally as of December 2016,  27 states afforded some kind of private school choice--and 14 states had voucher plans in law, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a bipartisan group that offers ""support, ideas, connections and a strong voice on Capitol Hill"" for legislators. Wondering how the coalition reached its claim, we contacted a coalition member, the Texas Freedom Network, which says it watchdogs far-right issues, organizations, money and leaders. The network’s Jose Medina, who’d distributed the coalition’s release, emailed us a web link to a 2007 network report including an appendix listing Texas  ""voucher legislation"" dating to 1993. Medina also pointed us to the network’s ""legislative watch"" web page showing bills filed under topics including vouchers from 1999 through 2015. Defining vouchers We paused to cover some definitions. Huriya Jabbar, a University of Texas education administration professor who has studied school choice and the political dimensions of education reforms, told us that ""school choice"" can include access to charter schools or the option to transfer to a different public school. Meanwhile, ""private school choice"" involves the use of public funds for private or parochial education. Asked about defining school vouchers alone, Jabbar pointed us to a 2015 article in Education Week, which covers schooling from kindergarten through high school. The article, ""What's the Difference Between Vouchers and Education Savings Accounts?,"" explains differences in private school options that often get described collectively as vouchers, a ""politically loaded term,"" the author wrote. The article says vouchers give parents ""public funding allocated for their child toward tuition at a private school of their choice, including religiously affiliated private schools."" Education savings accounts, similar to vouchers, can also pay for private tuition, the story says, though money in an account could be put toward out-of-class educational expenses such as tutoring or online enrichment. States that support such accounts set aside funds based on per-pupil funding estimates; parents may withdraw money for approved expenses, the story says. In Texas in 2017, state Sen. Larry Taylor, R-Friendswood, filed Senate Bill 3 proposing education savings accounts for students from all income levels plus scholarships for students with the ""greatest financial and academic need,"" Taylor’s measure states, to be supported by tax credits. That’s a funding approach taken by 17 states as of December 2016, according to the NCSL. States employ the credits, the article says, to ""incentivize businesses or individuals to donate money to a scholarship-granting organization, which then gives money to students"" to use for tuition at a private school. Texas is one of the states with constitutional amendments (often referred to as Blaine Amendments) that prohibit state funds from going to religious organizations. In those states, the Education Week article says, tax credit scholarships and education savings accounts ""offer workarounds."" We asked Josh Cunningham,  an NCSL education policy specialist, if education savings accounts and tax credit scholarships would reasonably be grouped with vouchers in that each approach furthers public funding of non-public schooling.  Cunningham suggested they could, as ""they all for the most part serve a similar purpose, providing support for a public school student to enter into private school."" Dozens of proposals Next, let’s review what we spotted in legislation considered since the 1995 session, which we based on text searches of ""voucher,"" ""scholarship"" and ""education savings account,"" to cover bills that dealt with public funding for private school tuition. We ran the terms through both the Texas Legislative Service website Telicon and the Texas Legislature online, which is managed by the Texas Legislative Council, session by session, coming up with 29 proposed bills related to school choice with funding in the form of vouchers, scholarships or savings accounts. We then checked each of the bills listed in the Coalition for Public Schools’ list in both services, to account for any that our search may have missed. In total, we found 54 relevant bills from every session that covered private ""school choice"" options. Among the proposals over the years, 11 envisioned pilot programs limited to certain student populations. For instance, House Bill 2366, which didn’t advance out of a House committee in 1999, called for a pilot program for ""educationally disadvantaged"" students. Six years later, HB 3042, which died in committee, more broadly called for vouchers for all students eligible to attend public schools.

A form of public school choice, short of private-school vouchers, passed into law in 1995 when lawmakers created the Public Education Grant program open to students in any school where half the students or more didn’t perform satisfactorily on state tests the three previous years or the school was declared ""low performing"" by the state during those years, according to a 1997 House Research Organization summary. Under the law, each eligible student could attend a school in another district backed by the state and local funding provided for their education in their original district. In 1997, lawmakers widened such opportunities via HB 318 authorizing the state to fund up to 100 ""open-enrollment charter schools,"" which students could attend with the grants, and otherwise allowing eligible students to apply a grant to attend another school in their home districts. Among other tweaks, a student would newly be eligible if half or more of a school’s students performed unsatisfactorily in any two of three previous years. A sampling of voucher proposals that died Also in 1997, Rep. Ron Wilson, D-Houston, proposed an amendment to a proposal that would’ve allowed students from low-performing schools to transfer to a private school and have tuition covered by state funds, provided the student attempted to enroll in another public school and was rejected. But House members deadlocked 68-68 on the amendment, which Wilson then withdrew after ""voucher opponents rounded up some absent members who could have killed his measure,"" according to a May 8, 1997 Houston Chronicle news article. At the time, state Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, called that moment the House’s ""closest vote ever"" on vouchers. Among other measures that would put public funds toward private school costs that didn’t become law was HB 2465, offered in 2003 by Rep. Kent Grusendorf, R-Arlington and chairman of the House Public Education Committee. Grusendorf’s plan would have created the Education Freedom Program for students in the state’s heaviest-enrollment districts. The bill’s analysis states that under the proposal, if a district served more than 40,000 students and a majority qualified as ""educationally disadvantaged,"" those students whose families met certain financial requirements could attend private schools with state aid. The bill won the endorsement of the House Public Education panel by 5-3, but didn’t make it to the House floor before the session ended. According to minutes of the House Calendars Committee, that panel voted 7-0 on May 10, 2003, not to move the legislation to the House ""at this time."" Before the education committee acted, according to an April 4, 2003 news story in the Dallas Morning News, HB 2465 was fiercely debated with teacher groups and local school boards arguing against approval, saying the legislation would ""rob the public schools of millions of dollars at a time when many are cutting programs."" Proponents, such as Chris Patterson with the Texas Public Policy Foundation, said that some children are still left behind in Texas, despite improvements to public education over the past two decades.

A dozen years later, in the 2015 legislative session, Senate Bill 4, authored by Sens. Taylor; Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston; and Donna Campbell R-New Braunfels, would have given a low-income student or a student with disabilities a tax-credit scholarship to ""attend the school of their choice,"" public or private. A bill analysis by the Senate Research Center  added that the bill would have allowed businesses to make donations to an ""educational scholarship organization"" and thus receive a tax credit for the donation. According to an April 2015 news story in the Austin American-Statesman, the 31-member Senate gave preliminary approval to the bill on a ""mixed 18-12 vote after rejecting a handful of Democratic-proposed amendments to the measure."" A Democrat, Sen. Eddie Lucio, Jr. of Brownsville, voted for the proposal, the story said, with Republican Sens. Robert Nichols of Jacksonville and Konni Burton of Colleyville voting against it. In the House, where the measure died May 5, 2015 after it was referred to the Ways and Means committee, Republicans such as House Public Education Chairman Rep. Jimmie Don Aycock of Killeen expressed concern with the state’s abilities to hold private schools accountable to the same standards as public schools. We reached out to organizations supportive of educational savings accounts to see how this claim stacked up in their eyes -- the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Texans for Education Opportunity.

NC teacher pay has been rising, but not by nearly as much as Sen. Phil Berger says
","Responding to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s ""State of the State"" speech Monday night, one of North Carolina’s top Republican leaders said his party has given the average teacher a substantial raise in recent years. Part of Cooper’s speech highlighted his proposal to give every teacher an extra $150 to buy textbooks for his or her classroom, since he said that their ""paychecks (are) stretched too thin already."" Republican Sen. Phil Berger, the president pro tem of the senate, gave the official response to Cooper’s speech. On the matter of education, Berger said he and his fellow Republicans deserve credit for giving teachers large raises. Berger told viewers to imagine a political party that had promised to ""raise average teacher pay by more than 15 percent in just three years."" He spoke about a few more issues, then concluded: ""That is exactly what House and Senate Republicans have accomplished in our state."" Actually, they did not. What he gets wrong In total, since the GOP took over control of the N.C. General Assembly in 2011, the average teacher’s pay has not risen 15 percent. It has risen about half that much. And that’s in the span of six years, not three. So Berger’s claim citing a three-year period ignores half the budgets passed by Republican lawmakers. But still, we asked which three years Berger was talking about. His office told us it’s the period from the 2014-15 school year until now. For reference, below is the average teacher pay in North Carolina for the last decade. Every budget starting in 2011-12 has been written and passed by Republican legislators. 2007-08: $47,354 2008-09: $48,648 2009-10: $46,850 2010-11: $46,605 2011-12: $45,933 2012-13: $45,737 2013-14: $44,990 2014-15: $47,819 2015-16: $47,985 2016-17: $49,837 Teacher pay began falling in 2009-10, under Democratic leadership. It continued falling in the next four budgets, three of which were written and passed by Republican legislators. Berger didn’t want to talk about those three budgets, just the most recent three. Nevertheless, his claim is still wrong. As the data shows, the raises in each of the last three years have taken the average teacher's salary from just under $45,000 a year to just under $50,000. One of those years, as we found in a previous fact check of Republican House Speaker Tim Moore, was the nation's biggest. But it still wasn't enough to make Berger's claim accurate. There has been a 10.8 percent raise, not a 15 percent raise. So how does he explain the difference between his claim and reality? Any proof? Berger’s office pointed us to a document from the state legislature that tracks pay changes for teachers and state employees each year since the 1970s. Amy Auth, Berger’s deputy chief of staff, said it backs up his claim. At first glance, it does appear to show that the raises since 2014-2015 add up to 15.5 percent. But there are several caveats to that number. Part of that was a bonus teachers received last year, which didn’t change their base pay and wasn’t repeated again this year. In other words, it wasn’t actually a raise. Also, in 2014 the state got rid of annual longevity bonuses for veteran teachers. At the same time, those teachers’ base salaries went up. For that reason the state counted the change as a raise – yet the loss of longevity pay gave the raise an inflated value, and some veteran teachers actually would’ve made more money if the change hadn’t happened, The News & Observer reported at the time. But even if you take the full 15.5 percent statistic at face value, it still only counts the state’s portion of teachers’ salaries – which is only about two-thirds of the total. The rest comes from supplements paid by 108 of the state’s 115 local school districts. So while some of the blame or credit for teacher pay will always rest outside the responsibility of legislative leaders like Berger, that doesn’t change the fact that his claim isn’t true. Furthermore, Berger in the past has frequently touted estimates that the state raised teacher pay to $50,000 this year. That would require counting the local supplements. His claim Monday also would have to include those local supplements, since he talked about the average salary. Yet his evidence ignored that, instead focusing only on the state’s base salaries. Our ruling Berger said Republicans in North Carolina promised to raise teacher pay ""by more than 15 percent in just three years,"" and ""that is exactly what House and Senate Republicans have accomplished in our state."" The average teacher's salary in the last three years has risen 10.8 percent. And over the entire time Republicans have been in charge of the state budget, the total raise has been even smaller than that, since teacher pay fell during the first three years of GOP control. Berger’s office pointed to numbers for just the state’s portion of teachers’ salaries. But there are some issues with the accounting there, and that’s also not what Berger actually talking about. Pay has been rising for North Carolina teachers recently, but not by nearly as much as Berger claims. We rate this claim Mostly False. Correction: Teachers have received a 10.8 percent raise over the last three years, not over the last four years as a previous version of this article said. There also has been a 4.2 percent increase in the last two years.  This does not change our ruling.",/factchecks/2017/mar/16/phil-berger/north-carolina-teacher-pay-has-been-rising-not-nea/

How often are guns sold without background checks?
","Sometimes even a zombie statistic faces its moment of reckoning. Today is one of those days. Several advocates of gun control addressed supporters and reporters at a Florida Capitol press conference to promote two bills that would tighten background checks for firearms (SB 1334 and HB 1113), including the Senate bill’s sponsor, Gary Farmer, D-Lighthouse Point. Several of the speakers offered statistics on gun violence and public opinion about gun-related policies. One of those was Hannah Willard, the public policy director of Equality Florida. She said, ""Experts estimate that 40 percent of gun sales occur in no-questions-asked transactions that often take place at gun shows or on the Internet."" Willard pointed us to her source -- a briefing page about background checks published by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. The page offers essentially identical language to what Willard said at the news conference:  To us, this was a familiar -- and imperfect -- talking point often raised by supporters of stricter gun laws. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe earned a Mostly False when he used it, as the statistic stems from survey data undertaken in 1994 and that included firearms given as gifts or inheritances, not just sold. When the authors of the study -- Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago and Philip Cook of Duke University -- adjusted the results to include only the guns sold, the number sold without background checks declined to between 14 percent and 22 percent. In 2015, Cook told PolitiFact that he and his co-author didn’t know whether their findings were relevant any longer, and added that no current national study had been published. We decided to check in again with the co-authors regarding Willard’s statement. Cook responded with some urgent news. ""We finally have an up-to-date survey that provides a good answer to the question of what percentage of gun transactions do not involve a background check,"" Cook said. Researchers Matthew Miller, Lisa Hepburn, and Deborah Azrael published a study in the January 2017 edition of the journal Annals of Internal Medicine that was specifically undertaken to update the 1994 data. The researchers asked 1,613 adult gun owners where and when they acquired their last firearm, including whether it was purchased, and whether they had either a background check or were asked to show a firearm license or permit. The answer: 22 percent obtained their gun without a background check. That’s barely half of the 40 percent figure that has gained wide currency for more than two decades. The 22 percent figure ""represents a smaller proportion of gun owners obtaining firearms without background checks than in the past,"" the authors wrote, though they emphasized that despite the smaller figure, ""millions of U.S. adults continue to acquire guns without background checks, especially in states that do not regulate private firearm sales."" When we asked Cook whether the new paper represented the definitive ""stake in the heart"" for this zombie statistic, he replied: ""Exactly."" In fact, Cook wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal, headlined, ""At Last, a Good Estimate of the Magnitude of the Private-Sale Loophole for Firearms."" In it, he wrote, ""Even though I bear some credit (or blame) for the earlier estimate, I could not be more pleased to be done with it, given that it is based on data from a survey done more than 20 years ago and that, in any event, never directly asked participants about background checks."" We will update with comment from the Brady Campaign if we get it. Our ruling Willard said, ""Experts estimate that 40 percent of gun sales occur in no-questions asked transactions that often take place at gun shows or on the Internet."" That statistic was already questionable, but by now it’s been definitively overtaken by a new study. The author of the old paper points to the paper published in January as the best estimate available, and it came up with a figure of 22 percent — just over half the percentage in the long-standing talking point. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2017/mar/16/hannah-willard/do-40-gun-sales-lack-background-checks-new-data-sa/
"['Environment', 'Animals', 'Texas', 'Will Herring']","
Feral-hog-meat businessman says there are no 'public' studies of hog pesticide
","A Texas meat processor who questions a government-approved bait that kills feral hogs charges there’s no public research on the product. Will Herring, owner of the Hubbard-based Wild Boar Meat Company, which makes hog meat into pet food, has said he fears the product’s active ingredient--warfarin, long known as a rat poison and human blood thinner--will damage his business. Also, Herring said: ""There’s not one public study, and by public study I mean a study available to the public, that has looked at using the product Kaput to poison feral hogs,"" a comment we spotted in a March 6, 2017, news story in the San Antonio Express-News. A note: Public studies of particular pesticides don’t appear to be mandatory. An Environmental Protection Agency web page about registering pesticides says only that the ""company that wants to produce the pesticide must provide data from studies  that comply with our testing guidelines"" without mention of whether the studies must be public or, say, conducted independently. That web page also says that before registering a product, EPA develops risk assessments evaluating the potential harms to humans, wildlife, fish, and plants, including endangered species and non-target organisms plus any possible contamination of surface water or groundwater from leaching, runoff and ""spray drift."" Still, Herring persuaded a state district judge to issue a temporary order putting a hold on state rules approving Kaput’s use by state-licensed pesticide applicators and state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, filed a proposal barring the state from registering any lethal pesticide, including warfarin, for feral hog control unless a state agency or university performs and publishes a scientific study weighing the pesticide’s environmental and economic effects. Both moves happened after Sid Miller, the Republican state agriculture commissioner, announced the Texas Department of Agriculture would issue rules limiting Kaput’s sale and use to licensed individuals. When we inquired, the state agency emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that Colorado-based Scimetrics, the company poised to vend Kaput, fielded $136,854 in research grants from TDA from 2013 into 2017. All told in 2016-17, the sheet indicates, the agency awarded $802,500 to fight feral hogs; that counts funds awarded to counties, universities and other agencies. Feral hogs can be fearsome nuisances. Nationally, as many as 750,000 are harvested annually, yet how they ravage rural and suburban lands remains a problem--and Texas is home to more than 2 million of them. No public study? We asked Herring how he reached his conclusion about no public studies. By phone, he told us that he didn’t find specific studies of the product in online searches nor, he said, did Genesis Laboratories, the Colorado-based company that developed the product, provide a study at his firm's inquiry. We also reached Richard Poché, Genesis Labs' president, who conceded that no Kaput study has been formally published. He said, though, the company completed a study in Texas in 2015 submitted under the title ""Field efficacy of a warfarin bait used to control feral hog populations"" for consideration by the Wiley-published Wildlife Society Bulletin, which describes itself as a journal for wildlife practitioners that effectively integrates cutting-edge science with management and conservation, and also covers important policy issues, particularly those that focus on the integration of science and policy. By email, the bulletin’s editor, Kansas State University’s David Haukos, confirmed that study was submitted. In March 2017, Haukos told us: ""The manuscript is currently undergoing peer-review; therefore, no decision has been made concerning publication."" Poché said by phone the 2015 study was followed up by another in 2016 with a third study underway in 2017, each one based on feeding the Kaput product to feral hogs. Both of the first two studies, he said, decimated exposed hog populations in North Texas study areas; he noted too the bait uses only one-fifth of the warfarin found in conventional rat and mouse baits. We asked for a copy of the 2015 study. By email, Poché said that remains ""confidential business information,"" and that releasing it before publication would leave his company with no control of where it ends up. Poché otherwise provided two of his own March 2017 PowerPoint presentations on Kaput along with the printed program for the April 2016 International Wild Pig Conference program in Myrtle Beach, S.C. A section of the program, ""Feral hog control using a new bait,"" evidently describes a Scimetric study. It opens: ""An EPA Experimental Use Permit was obtained to conduct a field trial using a novel bait to control feral hogs. The product, 12-years under development, was used to determine the efficacy against feral hogs on test sites 50 miles east of Plainview, Texas. Two paraffin bait formulations were tested, containing 0.005% and 0.01% warfarin. Hog activity was monitored pre- and post-treatment using trail cameras near feeders, VHF and GPS transmitting equipment, and bait consumption."" Next, the summary says: ""Bait was applied in modified commercial feeders with heavy lids. Baiting initiated on June 1 and terminated June 30, 2015. After the 30-day exposure period efficacy on the 5-km treatment plot baited with 0.005% warfarin was 100%, 98.6%, and 97.8% using radio-tracking, trail camera images, and bait consumption. Efficacy on the 0.01% warfarin bait plot was not as effective. Ninety-seven non-target searches were conducted during the treatment and post-treatment phases to examine for mortality, for which none were found,"" an indication other animals weren’t killed by the bait. The text closes: ""The low warfarin concentrate bait proved effective in eliminating wild hogs while posing minimal exposure to non-target wildlife."" The longer of the PowerPoint presentations includes a slide stating that warfarin was approved as a rodent-killer in 1948 and as a human drug six years later. The presentation also has several slides titled: ""Field Efficacy of a Feral Hog Bait Containing 0.005% Warfarin,"" with a subtitle indicating the slides refer to research in North Texas from 2015 into 2017. Images include feral hogs wearing GPS collars or tagged for tracking by radio. One slide summarizes the research results by different methods of making hog counts:                  SOURCE: Presentation, ""Where we’ve been and where we’re going with Warfarin for controlling wild pigs,"" March 1, 2017, Richard Poché, Genesis Labs (received by email from Poché, March 9, 2017) Company: No independent research ‘necessary’ Poché, asked if independent research makes sense before Kaput goes commercial, emailed: ""Not necessary. We do research under what is called Good Laboratory Practices, which is required by the EPA. No one can match the quality and integrity of the work."" According to an EPA web page, the agency conducts audits to ensure companies developing pesticide products comply with those practices. EPA registration Our search of EPA’s web site led us to a Jan. 3, 2017, agency document indicating that on Jan. 3, 2017, Kaput Feral Hog Bait was registered with the agency under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. ""Registration is in no way to be construed as an endorsement or recommendation of this product by the Agency,"" the document further states. ""In order to protect health and the environment, the Administrator, on his motion, may at any time suspend or cancel the registration of a pesticide in accordance with the Act."" Also, the document says, the product is ""conditionally registered"" in accord with section 3(c)(7)(a) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act; the section says the EPA administrator may conditionally register a pesticide if the pesticide is ""identical or substantially similar"" to a registered pesticide and approving the registration wouldn’t ""significantly increase the risk of any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment."" Another agency web page says: ""If EPA finds that the pesticide meets the standard for registration, but there are outstanding data requirements, the Agency may, under certain circumstances, grant a ‘conditional’ registration pursuant to FIFRA section 3(c)(7). However, before granting a conditional registration, EPA must determine that, although an application lacks some of the required data, use of the pesticide would not significantly increase the risk of unreasonable adverse effects on people or the environment during the time needed to generate the necessary data."" We asked Poché about ""outstanding data requirements"" with Kaput, as mentioned generally by the EPA. By email, Poché said a ""1-year storage stability study"" for Kaput has been submitted to the EPA. Poché unpacked: ""An EPA-registered pesticide requires stability of the chemical in the formula available to the public. The product is stored in the marketing container on the shelf at room temperature over a one-year period. The bait is analyzed every 3 months for the warfarin concentration. That analysis is done at the beginning and at 3, 5, 9, and 12 months after manufacturing. The goal is to ensure the bait is good after 1 year and the concentration of warfarin is plus or minus 10% of what the EPA label requires. In our case the concentrations were within 1% of the label requirements,"" Poché said. Over a couple days, we did not draw an EPA response to Herring’s claim. Otherwise the National Pesticide Information Center, which partners Oregon State University with the EPA, responded to our inquiry by pointing out a 1991 EPA ""fact sheet"" on warfarin that states the EPA evaluates pesticides by obtaining from producers a ""complete set of studies showing the human health and environmental effects of each pesticide. The Agency imposes any regulatory controls that are needed to effectively manage each pesticide's risks,"" the sheet says. State intends limits Miller, the state agriculture commissioner, is a former legislator who authored the Texas law enabling hunters to shoot at feral hogs from helicopters. At the TDA, spokeswoman Jennifer Dorsett responded to our inquiry about the absence of public studies of Kaput. Dorsett said by email: ""Kaput is an entirely proprietary product, so studies on the Kaput Feral Hog Bait are owned by the company and you would have to contact them directly to see if they will release them to you."" Also by email, TDA spokesman Mark Loeffler stressed that while the state agency helped fund Kaput research, its role is generally limited to cataloging pesticides approved by EPA, including Kaput, though Miller applied his authority to make Kaput ""state limited use,"" to be sold by licensed dealers and used by licensed applicators, Loeffler said. ""We do not do state-paid studies of proposed pesticides,"" Loeffler wrote. ""We are not required to do lengthy study of a product because we have little discretion to reject or deny"" registrations, he said. Dorsett otherwise provided a document listing a dozen reports on poisoning feral hogs, issued from 1987 through 2002, including seven titles specifying ""warfarin,"" we tallied. Dorsett said the agency’s toxicologist, Michael Hare, used the reports as references in evaluating Kaput as a state-limited-use pesticide. Dorsett told us relevant research also has involved the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service, which says it has officials in nearly every county demonstrating ""the latest technology and best practices to improve the state’s food and fiber system."" We didn't hear back from the service. Loeffler added that Miller has personally drawn on a 1995 post about warfarin’s history as a rat poison and its toxicity to animals put out by universities teamed in the Extension Toxicology Network. Excerpt: ""Warfarin is only slightly dangerous to humans and domestic animals when used as directed, but care must be taken with young pigs, which are especially susceptible."" Also, the post says, warfarin--which is insoluble in water--poses no threat to aquatic organisms and is ""practically non-toxic"" to game birds, with chickens ""relatively resistant."" Our ruling Herring said there’s no public study of Kaput, the product that might soon be available in Texas to attack feral hogs. There’s no public study of that EPA-registered product, we confirmed. But a 2015 study submitted to a science journal would become public if it’s accepted for publication. Also, the effects on feral hogs of warfarin, Kaput’s active ingredient, has been explored in published studies. We rate this statement Mostly True.

"['Economy', 'Illinois', 'Peter Roskam']","
Roskam says Obama admin the first to never top 3% in annual GDP growth
","Speaking at an event in Chicago earlier this month, U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., was talking tax policy and the economy when he pointed to lackluster economic growth that occurred under former President Barack Obama. ""The past (Obama) administration was the first administration that never had a whole year of 3 percent growth,"" Roskam said during a March 6 speech at the City Club of Chicago. It’s an oft-cited figure Republicans tend to throw around to highlight the weak economic recovery throughout Obama’s presidency, but does the data back it up? A familiar claim Roskam’s claim lacks some specifics, particularly the type of growth and time frame he was referring to in his speech. David Pasch, the Wheaton Republican’s communications director, provided a link to data compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis showing both the annual and quarterly percentage change in real gross domestic product, or GDP, which is the total value of goods and services provided in the country.   While annual figures on GDP growth date back to the Herbert Hoover administration and the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, the federal government did not start tracking quarterly growth until 1947. Considering the time frame for which this annual data is available, it’s safe to assume Roskam was referring to economic growth since the Hoover administration. In fact, Roskam’s claim is quite similar to a statement Donald Trump made during a campaign speech in October, which was fact-checked by our colleague Joshua Gillin at PolitiFact Florida. As was the case with Trump’s claim, Roskam is right when he says that year-over-year GDP growth never topped 3 percent while Obama was in office. But as Princeton University economist Alan Blinder told PolitiFact at the time, looking at annual data can be misleading because it doesn’t provide context or account for historical factors that affect economic growth, such as recessions and global crises. For example, Hoover came into office on the cusp of the Great Depression, and Obama took over during the tail end of the Great Recession and amid instability in the Middle East. That’s one of the main reasons why economists suggest looking at the percentage change in GDP by quarters, rather than growth in a single calendar year. When PolitiFact Florida fact-checked Trump saying Obama was the first president ""in modern history not to have a single year of 3 percent growth,"" data for the third and fourth quarters of 2016 was not yet available. But now it is. GDP growth in 2016 and the Obama years  According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the percentage change in GDP growth during the third and fourth quarters of the last year of Obama’s final term was 3.5 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, resulting in an average growth rate of 1.6 percent for 2016. That was down 1 percentage point from 2015 when GDP grew by 2.6 percent, which marked the best year for average growth under Obama. Typically, economic growth in the first quarter of a new presidency is attributed to the previous administration, meaning former President George W. Bush gets credit for the 5.4 percent contraction in the economy during the first three months of 2009. As for the remainder of Obama’s time in office, quarterly GDP growth averaged 2.0 percent, or 1.5 percent when averaging out annual figures. But if the data is used to compare one quarter to the same quarter from a year ago, there were two periods during Obama’s tenure in which growth exceeded 3 percent. Between the third quarters of 2009 and 2010, GDP growth was about 3.1 percent; and between the first quarters of 2014 and 2015, the economy grew by 3.3 percent, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. With the way Roskam refers to growth, however, Obama indeed was the first president who did not achieve more than 3 percent growth in GDP. Average growth under Bush Sr., was 2.1 percent; 3.9 percent for Bill Clinton; 2.3 percent for George H.W. Bush; and 3.5 percent for Ronald Reagan. The highest annual growth on record occurred in 1942 during the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, when GDP grew by a staggering 18.9 percent as the United States entered World War II and ramped up production following the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor.   Our ruling Roskam said the Obama ""administration was the first administration that never had a whole year of 3 percent growth."" While Roskam’s claim is accurate when based on annual GDP growth figures between 2009 and 2016, there are other ways to look at the data, such as from one quarter to the same in the previous year. Doing so reveals economic growth has surpassed 3 percent during two periods of Obama’s presidency. We rate Roskam’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/mar/16/peter-roskam/rep-roskam-gdp-growth-obama/

Donald Trump says he learned Obama tapped his phones from the New York Times
","When President Donald Trump tweeted on March 4 that former President Barack Obama ordered a wiretap on his phones during the election, he didn’t turn to the federal intelligence agencies for proof. Instead, he says he got it straight from the ""failing"" New York Times. In a March 15 interview, Fox News host Tucker Carlson asked Trump why he didn’t ask the agencies about any possible surveillance on him or his campaign before tweeting about it, given that the White House appears to have no evidence to backup his claims. ""Well, because the New York Times wrote about it,"" Trump replied. ""Not that I respect the New York Times. I call it the ‘failing’ New York Times. But they did write on Jan. 20, using the word ‘wiretap.’ "" The New York Times report does use the word ""wiretap;"" the print headline was ""Wiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides."" It doesn’t appear that Trump read the article closely, however, because it does not say Obama personally ordered a tap on his phones during the election, as Trump claimed in his tweet. How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! The New York Times article is about intercepted communications used by the FBI amid its investigation into some of Trump’s current and former aides — including Roger Stone, Carter Page and Paul Manafort — and their ties to Russia. It does not say whether the surveillance targeted Russians or Americans. Nor does it say Trump and his campaign were under investigation or surveillance. In fact, the author stipulates: ""It is not clear whether the intercepted communications had anything to do with Mr. Trump’s campaign, or Mr. Trump himself."" The difference between the substance of the New York Times article and what Trump claimed in his tweet is significant, because Trump’s tweet alleges Obama possibly acted outside the law to harm a political opponent, whereas the New York Times described aspects of an FBI investigation. A president cannot unilaterally order surveillance on an American citizen. The FBI would have to obtain a warrant from a judge first, and to do that, investigators would need to have a suspicion based in evidence  that Trump might have committed a crime. As president, Trump could find out whether a court ever issued such a warrant. Congress has asked FBI Director James Comey for any evidence that a warrant was requested, issued or denied. In his interview with Carlson, Trump also mentioned a Fox News segment with host Bret Baier as a source. However, that segment — and a few more news articles the White House has provided as evidence — discusses unproven allegations that the FBI requested warrants to surveil Trump associates. It does not back up Trump’s accusation that Obama personally ordered a wiretap on Trump for political sabotage. Our ruling Trump said ""the New York Times wrote about"" Obama wiretapping him during the election. The New York Times article Trump references says the FBI has used intercepted communications in its investigation of several Trump associates and their ties to Russia. It does not say Obama ordered this surveillance, nor does it say Trump’s own phones were tapped or that he was under surveillance in any way.

We decided to look into Gutierrez’s claim that the final version of the Affordable Care Act incorporated hundreds of Republican amendments. When the ACA was making its way through Congress, former President Barack Obama made a similar statement in September 2009. During a joint address to Congress, he said that his plan incorporated the ideas of both Republicans and Democrats. We rated that claim Mostly False, because many of the amendments Republicans introduced were technical in nature. Republicans had several opportunities to introduce amendments to the Affordable Care Act, in both the Senate and House bills. Ultimately, for procedural reasons tied to the death of Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., the Senate version was the only one that moved forward. But Republicans offered changes in the committees that considered the bills before the whole chambers voted on them. For example, 788 amendments were submitted during the ACA’s markup in the Senate Committee for Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee (HELP). Three quarters of them were filed by the committee’s Republican members, according to John McDonough in his book Inside National Health Reform. Of those, 161 were adopted in whole or revised form. Yet as we reported at the time, those amendments were mostly technical. Only two of those Republican amendments were passed via roll-call vote. One of these amendments required members of Congress and congressional staff to enroll in the government-run option and the other involved biologics medication. The Senate Finance Committee took up another version of the bill. Senators initially offered 564 amendments. During that markup, about six Republican amendments were adopted via roll call vote, and others were adopted by unanimous consent, without objection, and via voice vote, according to coverage by Congressional Quarterly. Parts of this bill merged with the bill the HELP committee marked up to become the final law. Gutierrez’s office pointed us toward a fact sheet from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s, D-Calif., office that said 147 Republican amendments were incorporated in the final Senate bill, though the sheet did not expand on the nature of those amendments. On the House side, some Republican amendments to the Affordable Care Act were accepted in committee; 24 Republican amendments were incorporated in the Energy and Commerce Committee, and six were incorporated in the Education and Workforce committee. Republicans sponsored 38 amendments in the Ways and Means committee, and each one was rejected.   Timothy Jost, emeritus professor of law at Washington and Lee University School of Law, told us that ""the basic statement that hundreds were adopted is wrong."" But Jost added that ""there was very significant Republican participation early on on the Senate side. There were dozens of hours of debate, and Republicans like Sen. Chuck Grassley on the Senate Finance Committee were very engaged."" Jost said by September 2009 that period was over and from then on, the bill was strictly a Democratic piece of legislation. It’s worth noting that many facets of the Republican’s health care agenda at the time made it into the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act was a private market plan, and it dropped a long-held Democratic priority to include a public option. In the end, no Senate or House Republicans voted for the Affordable Care Act in its final version. Our ruling Gutierrez said that ""hundreds of Republican amendments were adopted"" during the drafting of the 2010 health care law. His statement has some basis, because Republican amendments were adopted in both the House and the Senate during the legislative process. Most of these amendments were not particularly meaningful, though, so calling it a bipartisan enactment effort remains a stretch.

"['Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'Florida', 'Guns', 'Dennis Baxley']","
Did Florida's stand your ground law reduce violent crime?
","As one of the original authors of Florida’s 2005 ""stand your ground"" law, Sen. Dennis Baxley, has a long history of touting its success. Since the 2012 shooting death of Miami Gardens teen Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, opponents have pointed to an increase in justifiable homicides to argue against the law, which protects individuals who use deadly force in self-defense instead of retreating. Baxley, a Republican from Ocala, has repeatedly countered that argument and others by connecting the law’s passage 12 years ago with decreasing crime rates. He did it again in a March 15 debate on legislation that would shift the burden of proof from the defendant to the prosecutor in ""stand your ground"" cases. (The Senate approved SB 128 by a 23-15 vote; the House version has received the backing of one committee so far.) ""So what has happened since 2005?"" Baxley asked. ""We’ve seen violent crime continuously go down. Is that not the public policy result that we would want?"" When we examined a similar statement in 2012, we found that there had been a drop, but rates were declining before the law went into effect in 2005, calling into question what impact the law really had. Now it’s time to put this claim to the test once again, using updated data and research. Overall violent crime rate in Florida has dropped, but not every year Data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting statistics shows that from 2005 to 2015, the violent crime rate in Florida decreased by a cumulative 34.9 percent overall. However, if you look at the changes from year to year, the violent crime rate did go up three times — in 2006, 2007 and 2014. (And remember, the rate had been dropping for several years anyway.) Given that there is a certain amount of ""noise"" in yearly crime statistics, those spikes don’t really undercut the argument that violent crime has been dropping overall in Florida. However, the word ""continuously"" is too strong to describe the trend line. ""I do not think that is quite the correct word to use,"" said Bill Bales, a professor in the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Florida State University. However, Baxley's argument is not far off as long as ""the declines experienced were very minimal."" Other experts have offered a similar assessment in previous fact-checks of crime data. Alan Lizotte, a University at Albany criminologist, told PolitiFact last year that ""a small increase between two time points is not an increase when the 20-year trend is downward.  If it went on for several years, it might indicate an increase."" Impact of ‘stand your ground’ not proven The bigger problem is Baxley’s assertion that the ""stand your ground"" law led to a demonstrable reduction on violent crime. (He confirmed through an aide that that was his point.) In reality, violent crime in the United States has decreased since the 1990s, except for an uptick in the past two years that has come nowhere near erasing the previous quarter century of declines. Given that, it’s hard to separate the downward trend in violent crime in Florida from the decline on the national level, which was also mirrored in many individual states. ""I would posit that it has had little or no effect on any decrease,"" added Charles Rose, a Stetson University law professor. Baxley did not offer any evidence that showed ""stand your-ground"" had a demonstrable impact on crime. In fact, there’s actually contrary evidence. The journal JAMA Internal Medicine published a study in November 2016 that found that firearm homicides increased after the 2005 passage of the law in Florida. That’s a narrower measurement than violent crimes overall, but the findings shed some light on the issue. The study was done by David Humphreys of the University of Oxford, Antonio Gasparrini of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Douglas Wiebe of the University of Pennsylvania. They looked at trends for firearm homicides in Florida between 1999 and 2014. It found that after the ""stand your ground"" law took effect in October 2005, rates of homicide by firearm in the state significantly increased. ""These increases appear to have occurred despite a general decline in homicide in the United States since the early 1990s,"" the authors wrote. And states without a ""stand your ground"" law that were studied — New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and Virginia — saw no such uptick. ""Our findings support the hypothesis that increases in the homicide and homicide by firearm rates in Florida are related to the ‘stand your ground’ law,"" the authors wrote. Our ruling Referring to the year that the ""stand your ground"" law passed, Baxley said, ""What has happened since 2005? We’ve seen violent crime continuously go down."" Crime has gone down significantly since 2005, though ""continuously"" is overstated. Moreover, it is hard to pin the cause of the decline on the passage of the ""stand your ground"" law, since the decline in Florida has been mirrored on the national level. If anything, firearm-related homicides may have increased after the law’s passage, according to one peer-reviewed study.

Bernie Sanders says Amazon paid no federal income tax in 2017. He's right
","The Forbes headline looked pretty good for Amazon chief Jeff Bezos: With the stock soaring, the world’s richest man accrued $9 billion in just two days. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., offered a different take on the company. ""You know what Amazon paid in federal income taxes last year?"" Sanders tweeted. ""Zero."" You know what Amazon paid in federal income taxes last year?Zero. https://t.co/2bVwXQNATl We’ve taken a look at a series of exaggerated claims about Amazon in the past. But in this case, Sanders is on the money. Amazon’s 2017 tax return is not public, and a company spokesman did not return our request for comment. So to find the answer, experts told us to look at the company’s annual filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company could face stiff penalties from the SEC for misleading reports. In its annual report filed to the SEC in February 2018, Amazon estimated that not only would the company not be paying anything in 2017 federal income taxes, but it would be getting a $137 million tax refund. So how did Amazon, which reported $5.6 billion in profit, expect to get money from the federal government in April? Amazon lists two line items that likely got them here: tax credits worth $220 million and stock-based compensation worth $917 million. These reflect the normal workings of the tax system, according to Annette Nellen, professor and director of the Master of Science in Taxation program at San Jose University. ""I would stress Amazon is just following the provisions that are in the law,"" Nellen said. Companies aren’t required to spell out which tax credits they claim in their annual report, but Nellen said they likely include write-offs for research and development, domestic production, and equipment depreciation for Amazon. Stock-based compensation, on the other hand, is spelled out a bit more clearly. Stocks are often handed out as a form of compensation to employees (usually executives) at small startups without much cash on hand. It’s also a common incentive for executives to make the company more profitable. Companies are taxed on their income, which is revenue minus costs. When stocks are offered as compensation, they are counted as a cost. This reduces the company’s taxable income. The trick for companies? They get to write off the value at which the stock was later traded, not the original price for which they sold their stock to employees. ""Even if the grant was pennies on the dollar, the companies get to write off the full market value,"" said Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. This year was the first time Amazon didn’t pay anything in federal income taxes. Gardner attributed that to executives cashing out on stocks they had been sitting on for a while. A 1993 law capped untaxed executive compensation at $1 million — but the cap doesn’t apply to stock-based compensation. The new tax law signed by President Donald Trump subjects these stocks to the same rule, which will apply to Amazon’s 2018 taxes. Overall, the new tax law largely works in Amazon’s favor, driving down the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent. While that will only apply to Amazon’s 2018 income, its impact can be felt today. Deferred taxes mostly apply to capital investments, or such things as equipment and new warehouses. Taxes on these items are deferred throughout the lifetime of the investment. So even if the tax rate was 35 percent at the time the investment was made, when the company actually pays these deferred taxes, the new 21 percent rate will apply. This line item shrank Amazon’s estimated future taxes by $789 million. Paying below the statutory tax rate isn’t new for Amazon. From 2011 to 2016, Amazon reported a total $8.2 billion of pre-tax income and $944 million in federal income taxes, which amounts to a tax rate of 11.4 percent in the last five years, Gardner calculated. Amazon, which launched online in 1995, long resisted charging a sales tax. But by 2012, it was collecting and paying sales taxes in multiple states. In 2017, it officially began paying taxes in every state where sales taxes exist, plus Washington, D.C. Sanders said, ""You know what Amazon paid in federal income taxes last year? Zero."" We can’t know that for certain until we see Amazon’s tax return. But experts say the closest estimate is that Amazon indeed paid zero in federal income taxes. In fact, Amazon estimates a $137 million rebate. Experts said there was no indication of foul play. The tax credits and write-offs for stock-based compensation that enabled this were passed by Congress.

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Patrick Morrisey']","
Did Evan Jenkins once say his philosophy was 'progressive mainstream'?
","The accusations flew fast and furious in a Fox News-sponsored debate between three Republican Senate contenders in West Virginia. We’re checking several claims from the May 1 debate, which featured former coal CEO Don Blankenship, U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins, and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Each is running for the nomination to face Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in the general election. Here, we’ll fact-check one of several assertions Morrisey made about Jenkins’ past Democratic affiliation. As we’ve previously noted, Jenkins was initially registered as a Democrat, then switched to Republican, then back to Democratic when he sought a seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1993. He remained a Democrat until July 2013, when he became a Republican to successfully challenge U.S. Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va. In the debate, Morrisey addressed Jenkins and said, ""You said your philosophy was ‘progressive mainstream’ back in 2003."" (It’s at about the 5:10 mark here.) We found that Jenkins did use those words, although Morrisey glossed over some context about the comment. Morrisey’s camp pointed us to an Aug. 13, 2003, article in the Herald-Dispatch newspaper of Huntington, W. Va. The article addressed West Virginia’s 2004 gubernatorial election, in which incumbent Democratic Gov. Bob Wise declined to seek another term. Manchin easily won the Democratic primary and the governorship that fall. With the headline, ""Some say governor is right not to run,"" the story quotes Jenkins about the still-developing candidate field for the governorship. At the time, Jenkins was a Democratic state senator. Here’s the relevant part: ""This is an opportunity for Democrats, who I hope will put forth a nominee who can chart a course that gets away from the politics of the past and talk about addressing some of our tough economic development challenges,"" Jenkins said. ""I hope the end result is a candidate who will talk about progressive mainstream issues and not talk about coalition building of special interest groups. I think voters in the mainstream are tired of politics of the past and ready for some new, strong leadership."" So Jenkins definitely said the words ""progressive mainstream."" But Morrisey’s characterization of the comments are somewhat off. Jenkins didn’t exactly say the term described his own ""own philosophy,"" as Morrisey charged during the debate. Rather, Jenkins was using the phrase to describe the philosophy a hypothetical gubernatorial candidate might pursue. It’s also worth noting that, unlike today, the term ""progressive"" was not used as widely as a near-synonym for ""liberal"" back in 2003. The specific policies that Jenkins mentioned in the 2003 exchange were not ones considered central to the ""progressive"" agenda today, such as abortion rights and gun control, but rather economic development, which is not an issue with support that’s exclusive to either the left or the right. Indeed, the overall gist of Jenkins’ remarks focuses on ditching the ""politics of the past"" and not kowtowing to ""special interest groups."" Morrisey said to Jenkins, ""You said your philosophy was ‘progressive mainstream’ back in 2003."" Jenkins did use those words in an aspirational tone for a 2003 newspaper article. But Jenkins was talking about issues a hypothetical Democratic gubernatorial candidate should run on, not his own political philosophy.

Did Evan Jenkins correctly cite past PolitiFact rulings in a debate?
","It’s not every day that PolitiFact fact-checks are wielded as rhetorical weapons in U.S. Senate debates, but that’s exactly what happened in a May 1 debate that pitted three Republican candidates for U.S. Senate in West Virginia. During the hotly contested campaign, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey has regularly attacked one of his rivals, U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins, for a history of deviating from conservative orthodoxy. As we’ve previously noted, Jenkins was initially registered as a Democrat, then switched to Republican, then back to Democratic when he sought a seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1993. He remained a Democrat until July 2013, when he became a Republican to successfully challenge U.S. Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va. During the debate, Morrisey said, referring to Jenkins: ""I wasn’t the one recruited by the liberal establishment because of his very questionable record. Once again, Obamacare support, cap and trade support, donating to Joe Manchin, holding a fundraiser at his house. That’s not the West Virginia values we need to drain the swamp in Washington."" To rebut this attack, Jenkins pointed to a prior PolitiFact fact check. ""Unfortunately, Patrick Morrisey continues to spew his lies and misrepresentations,"" Jenkins said. ""We had PolitiFact, and all the things Patrick is saying — supporting Hillary Clinton, cap and trade, Planned Parenthood — PolitiFact went through each and every allegation and said, ‘False, False, False, False.’"" Did Jenkins cite our research correctly? He did, up to a point. The congressman was referring to an article in which we checked a Morrisey statement that Jenkins ""has the same positions on the issues as Joe Manchin: supporting Hillary (Clinton), supporting cap-and-trade, supporting Planned Parenthood, many tax increases."" Here’s the rundown of the three issues Jenkins cited: • Support for Hillary Clinton. The Morrisey campaign had cited Jenkins’ attendance at a July 27, 2007, economic policy town hall Clinton hosted at West Virginia State University. But that’s not the same as a vote -- especially since Jenkins attended a similar event for President George W. Bush in 2004, when he was a Democrat. Morrisey’s campaign also told us they believed Jenkins had voted for Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary in 2008 because he had stated he didn’t support Obama but still voted. But Jenkins could have skipped voting for president on that ballot -- as his campaign says he did. All told, there’s no solid proof of Jenkins having voted for Clinton. • Support for cap-and-trade. Cap-and-trade legislation sets limits on emissions and then lets companies trade emission reduction credits. Carbon-emitting fuels like coals are at a disadvantage under such a system, making such laws unpopular in coal-heavy West Virginia. Morrisey’s campaign said that in 1997, Jenkins sponsored HB 2476, a bill to create an emissions banking and trading program to incentivize better air quality. But Patrick McGinley and James Van Nostrand, two environmental law experts at West Virginia University familiar with the law, disagreed with that interpretation. They said the 1997 bill lacks a cap on emissions, the critical feature of cap-and-trade legislation. • Support for Planned Parenthood. Jenkins has cast repeated votes to defund Planned Parenthood due to its provision of abortion services, including the ""No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act,"" ""Defund Planned Parenthood Act"" and the ""Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act."" For our prior fact-check, the Morrisey campaign cited a 2006 Project Vote Smart survey on abortion in which Jenkins did not offer an opinion prohibiting public funding of abortions and to organizations that advocate or perform abortions. However, the Project Vote Smart website itself said that a lack of response did not indicate opposition to a policy. Jenkins did not respond to the most recent survey. So our previous fact-check provides significant support for Jenkins’ claim. But there are some important holes to mention. • New evidence. Morrisey’s campaign provided one new piece of evidence for the Planned Parenthood assertion that didn’t exist when we wrote our first fact-check. They noted that Jenkins voted for an omnibus spending bill on March 22, 2018. The bill doesn’t specifically direct funding to Planned Parenthood. However, it keeps the longstanding status quo, under which the federal government pays for non-abortion-related services provided by Planned Parenthood through Medicaid and other programs. (We rated a similar claim from North Carolina Half True.) • Jenkins’ language was too loose. Jenkins saying that PolitiFact had debunked ""all the things Patrick (Morrisey) is saying."" In reality, three of the four specific items Morrisey cited in the preceding remark were ones the PolitiFact fact-check didn’t address. (The one we previously did fact-check was Jenkins’ support for cap-and-trade.) The remaining three claims we hadn’t yet checked were Jenkins’ ""Obamacare support ... donating to Joe Manchin, (and) holding a fundraiser at his house"" for Manchin. On these three issues, Morrisey has a point. In 2011, Jenkins sponsored and voted for a bill to bring an Affordable Care Act health care exchange to West Virginia. Meanwhile, Jenkins donated $1,000 to Manchin’s bid for governor on April 17, 2007, and another $1,000 on March 27, 2008. Finally, Jenkins hosted a fundraiser for Manchin at his home on March 27, 2008, that raised over $6,000. Jenkins said, ""All the things Patrick (Morrisey) is saying — (that I supported) Hillary Clinton, cap and trade, Planned Parenthood — PolitiFact went through each and every allegation and said, ‘False, False, False, False.’ "" Jenkins correctly cited PolitiFact’s conclusions on the three specific topics he himself mentioned. However, Jenkins’ statement came as a rebuttal to a remark by Morrisey that cited three separate examples of Jenkins’ alleged support for Democrats or liberal issues. In reality, PolitiFact had not fact-checked those three topics at the time of the debate, and now that we have looked into them, we find support for Morrisey’s position, not Jenkins’. Voters tuning into the race for the first time could easily get the wrong impression about the accuracy of the attacks.

Ted Cruz falsely says Beto O'Rourke once resolved to legalize all narcotics
","U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, seeking a second term representing Texas, declared that his Democratic challenger from El Paso made a ""radical"" move to legalize all narcotics. The Houston Republican said in his May 1, 2018, tweet: ""With opioids ravaging so many American communities, Congressman Beto O’Rourke's radical resolution to legalize all narcotics--including heroin and other deadly opioids--is looking worse and worse all the time."" David Wysong of O’Rourke’s campaign brought Cruz’s claim to our attention. By email, Wysong noted that in 2012, we rated Half True a claim that O’Rourke favored legalizing drugs across the board. O’Rourke, then a member of the El Paso City Council, favored legalizing marijuana, we confirmed, but had called only for debate about legalizing narcotics. Cruz points out Daily Caller story Cruz’s tweet pointed to a May 1, 2018, story posted by the conservative Daily Caller headlined ""Remember That One Time Beto O’Rourke Called for Legalizing All Narcotics."" The story includes video of O’Rourke speaking at what’s evidently the Jan. 6, 2009, El Paso City Council meeting, which included adoption of a resolution urging federal action to stem violence on the Mexico side of the border. O’Rourke, seeking to amend the resolution, said at the meeting: ""And I’d ask that there be some language in here that would also include advocating, or looking at, rethinking our War on Drugs, which by any measure I’ve looked it has been an abject failure. And also, looking at ending the prohibition on narcotics in the United States. And I’m not saying that we need to do that – to end the prohibition. I think we need to have a serious discussion about doing that, and that may, in the end, be the right course of action."" The resolution opens by noting criminal violence playing out in neighboring Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. It also generally urges a national shift from the war on drugs to a focus on prevention and rehabilitation. The resolution, unanimously approved by the council, doesn’t state that all narcotics should be legalized. It does say that the mayor and council urge the federal government to support local law enforcement battling the illegal export of weapons to Mexico and to stiffen penalties on people who ""illegally traffic chemical agents used in the manufacturing of illicit drugs."" The resolution also offers support to federal, state and local agencies battling money laundering, vehicle theft, gun smuggling and other cross-border criminal activity. Specific to drugs, the resolution urges funding ""greater efforts to reduce"" U.S. drug consumption and support for legislation ""that examines the nation’s policies on drugs with a focus on rehabilitation rather than incarceration."" Also, the resolution says, the federal government should be supporting ""an honest, open national debate on ending the prohibition on narcotics."" When we emailed Cruz’s camp asking how he concluded that O’Rourke wants to legalize all narcotics, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier provided a Jan. 6, 2009, Associated Press news story headlined ""El Paso wants feds to consider legalizing drugs."" That story slightly misquotes the El Paso council resolution, saying it calls for  an ""open, honest, national dialogue on ending the prohibition of narcotics."" Next, it quotes O’Rourke saying: ""We think it should at least be on the table and so far it hasn't."" Our online search for that story led us to a Jan. 22, 2009, news story about El Paso in the New York Times stating that the ""conflict in Juárez has led some in El Paso to propose radical solutions. In a symbolic resolution of support for Juárez, the El Paso City Council recently voted unanimously to ask Washington to consider legalizing drugs as a way to end the violence."" The story then quoted O’Rourke saying that ending the prohibition should be on the table. The Times story said too that the council backed off its resolution on Jan. 13, 2009 after Mayor John Cook vetoed it and and local members of Congress warned that the council’s stance might imperil federal aid. But as noted in a May 2, 2018, Texas Tribune news story, O’Rourke later conceded that his call for open debate could have been handled better. O’Rourke wrote in his 2011 book, ""Dealing Death and Drugs: The Big Business of Dope in the U.S. and Mexico,"" that after the resolution came to the council from a city committee on border relations, ""I asked whether we should more aggressively address the issues related to demand and prohibition."" O’Rourke wrote that he listened to council discussion and then offered his amendment, ""composed on the spot,"" O’Rourke wrote, to ""encourage ‘an honest, open, national debate on ending the prohibition on narcotics.’"" O’Rourke elaborated: ""It was an artless, and even inaccurate amendment to the larger resolution (I only learned later that marijuana is not a narcotic, even though it was precisely that drug that I felt people would be most open to debating), but it got the point across. ""I knew we were addressing a taboo topic, one that conventional wisdom dictated that only potheads, hard-core libertarians and political suicides ever brought up. But I also knew that Juarez had gone beyond the pale and it was time to place all options on the table, even those that had been unthinkable, for me as well as others, just a year ago."" On his campaign website, O'Rourke calls for ending the federal government's war on drugs and encouraging reforms in drug control policies. He also calls for ending the ""federal prohibition on marijuana."" O’Rourke told residents of Sonora, Texas on April 28, 2018, that he’s among co-sponsors of legislation to decriminalize marijuana under federal law. Congressional records show O’Rourke in May 2017 signed on as a co-sponsor of an act removing marijuana from the federal controlled substances list. The act’s author, Rep. Thomas Garrett, R-Va., said in a statement that his proposal would leave it to individual states to determine appropriate medicinal uses of marijuana. Our ruling Cruz said O’Rourke had a resolution to legalize all narcotics. In 2009, an El Paso City Council resolution directed at the federal government included language from O’Rourke urging open debate about ending the national prohibition of narcotics. The resolution, adopted but later vetoed, did not call for legalizing all narcotics nor did we spot evidence that O’Rourke has taken that sweeping stand. We rate Cruz’s claim False.

Donald Trump says wrongly the Iran nuclear deal expires in 7 years
","President Donald Trump has until May 12 to decide whether to continue waiving sanctions against Iran under the 2015 agreement that rolled back the country’s nuclear program. At an April 30 press conference, Trump said pulling out of the deal would send the right message on American policy. ""In seven years that deal will have expired, and Iran is free to go ahead and create nuclear weapons,"" Trump said. ""That's not acceptable. Seven years is tomorrow. That's not acceptable."" Trump is incorrect about the expiration date. The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, puts a cap on enriched uranium until 2030, or 12 years from now. After that, other agreements limit nuclear weapons development in Iran. A full nuclear weapons program needs fuel for a bomb, a warhead, and a way to deliver the warhead, such as a missile or a plane. ""By far the most important and the most difficult step is producing the fuel,"" said Matthew Kroenig at Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service. ""That’s why the Obama administration wanted to limit Iran’s capacity to enrich uranium. And it’s why it was so important to Iran to have the limits end after 15 years."" Under the deal, Iran gave up 97 percent of its stockpile of enriched uranium. It also lost 14,000 of its 20,000 centrifuges, the machines used to enrich uranium, and it agreed to only enrich uranium to a level unsuitable for weapons for 15 years. For plutonium, the other possible fuel for a nuclear bomb, the agreement bans plutonium reactors for 15 years and stipulates that Iran must dismantle its current one. The White House pointed to an Associated Press article about a confidential side agreement that, according to the article, allows Iran to ""install centrifuges up to five times as efficient as the 5,060 machines it is now restricted to using."" That would kick in at Year 11, or 2026. The article warned that this could reduce the time needed to produce weapons-grade uranium after the deal expired. The White House also noted a Brookings Institution summary that said that after 2025, Iran could ""test large numbers of, and conduct enrichment R&D with, advanced centrifuges,"" and get a space ready for running the most advanced centrifuge after 2030. So starting seven years from now, Iran could begin developing and then using better centrifuges. However, both of those sources noted that for 15 years, Iran could not have more than 300 kg (660 pounds) of low-enriched uranium, well below the amount experts agree is needed to make a single bomb. Why does the cap matter? Because even as Iran installed more efficient centrifuges, it could not end up with more enriched uranium than is permitted. The agreement spells out various ways to make that happen, either by diluting the uranium or sending it out of the country under international controls. The Arms Control Association, a group that supports the Iran deal, produced this timeline. The gray bars at the top show the changes in the centrifuge rules at the 10-year mark, and the limits on enriched uranium through the 15-year mark.  Trump said that in seven years Iran would be free to build nuclear weapons. But under the agreement and the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, Iran agreed on paper at least that it would never build a nuclear weapon. Formally, it would not be free to do as it pleases. ""Some of the terms last forever,"" said nuclear arms expert Matthew Bunn at Harvard’s Kennedy School. ""The deal prohibits Iran forever from the key activities of a nuclear weapon design and manufacture program — experimenting with the relevant types of explosives, doing the relevant neutron modeling, and so on."" Bunn added: ""And Iran’s acceptance of the broader inspections called for in the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Additional Protocol also lasts indefinitely."" The Additional Protocol improves international oversight of nuclear fuel, from when it is mined to when it becomes waste, and allows broader inspections, such as collecting environmental samples at any location to detect radioactive materials. Plus, many activities have to be approved by a commission that oversees the agreement. The deal does have one element that clearly ends at the 10-year mark. If Iran fully complies with the deal for a decade, the U.N. Security Council’s resolutions on Iran’s nuclear program come to an end. That is called Termination Day. The agreement itself continues in force, but the United Nations no longer has Iran’s nuclear program on its docket. The White House noted this clause. Trump said that the Iran nuclear deal expires in seven years and after that, Iran is free to develop a nuclear weapon. The agreement’s limits on enriched uranium last for another 12 years. While some restrictions ease after seven years, the key elements that prevent Iran from enriching the uranium needed for a bomb remain until 2030. In addition, certain terms last forever, including the prohibition on ever designing or making a nuclear weapon, and remaining under the eye of international inspectors.

Greg Abbott: George Soros of New York pouring money into Texas to elect Democratic 'puppets' in fall
","In 2017, we found no evidence of George Soros, the internationally prominent pro-Democratic financier, investing in races for state office in Texas. More recently, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott warned afresh about Soros in a fundraising letter, opening: ""Every weapon in the national Democrat machine’s arsenal is aimed straight at Texas today."" Abbott’s April 2, 2018, letter states next: ""Left-wing BILLIONAIRE George Soros has already unloaded a whopping $1 million to install his liberal puppets in positions of power this fall."" The letter warns that Democrats are preparing an all-out assault and could seize control of the state at the ballot box. ""I know,"" the letter further says, that ""left-wing special interests and BILLIONAIRE liberals like George Soros are pouring outrageous sums of money into driving up Democrat turnout."" After we didn’t hear back from Abbott about his basis for the ""puppets"" claim, we decided to check state, local and federal records for indications of Soros unpacking lucre to help Texas Democrats win election in 2018. Soros helped a Bexar County Democrat From the top, we knew that Soros invested significantly in a group that backed a successful challenger to the Bexar County district attorney. Attorney Joe Gonzales bested first-term incumbent Nicholas ""Nico"" LaHood in Bexar County’s Democratic primary after Soros contributions propelled a pro-Gonzales political committee. Of note: Soros boosted the pro-Gonzales committee a couple of years after Soros put more than $1.4 million into electing Democrat Kim Ogg as the district attorney of Harris County. An October 2016 Houston Chronicle news story pointed out that Soros had similarly put his money into district attorney races in Florida, Illinois, Mississippi and New Mexico, each time through state-specific PACs with variations on the name ""Safety and Justice."" The story also said Soros had supported criminal justice reforms including reduced racial disparities in sentencing and relaxed marijuana restrictions. In San Antonio, LaHood chalked up his loss to Soros’s spending, the San Antonio Express-News reported. ""In my opinion, the voters were unfairly influenced by $1 million worth of lies,"" LaHood said. ""There's no other way to say it."" Gonzales has yet to win the DA post; he’s set to face Republican Tylden Shaeffer on this November's ballot. For his part, Gonzales said after his primary win that Soros’ contributions came without strings attached. ""There was a clear understanding from the beginning that we would accept their contributions, but we were not going to be told how to run this office,"" Gonzales said. An Express-News spreadsheet tallies contributions by Soros to Texas Justice & Public Safety, the political committee supportive of Gonzales. According to the sheet, which was based on Gonzales’ campaign finance reports filed with the county elections department on Jan. 17, Feb. 5 and Feb. 26, 2018, the committee made $964,377 worth of in-kind contributions to Gonzales’ campaign from Dec. 18, 2017, through Feb. 23, 2018, mostly in TV ads and voter mailings but also in polling, research and palm cards. Gonzales’ campaign directly fielded no Soros contributions, the filings indicate. Multiple Democratic beneficiaries? Abbott’s fundraising letter warns of Soros spending money to install ""puppets."" To gauge whether Soros chose multiple Texas Democrats to help, we conducted online searches of candidate and political committee finance reports filed with  the Texas Ethics Commission and Federal Election Commission. Previously, our 2017 search of campaign finance reports filed with the ethics commission from 2000 into 2017 indicated Soros hadn’t personally donated to candidates for state office--not once. Similarly, our fresh search of state records yielded no indication of Soros spending on races besides the Bexar County battle for the Democratic nomination for district attorney. In pre-primary reports, we found, the pro-Gonzales Texas Justice & Public Safety committee reported fielding $1.04 million in Soros contributions. According to our separate search of campaign reports filed with the FEC, Soros made 49 contributions nationally from February 2017 into March 2018, totaling $4,587,000. But, our search suggests, very little went to Texas Democrats. We identified a single Soros contribution to a Texas candidate. Soros gave $2,700 on Dec. 1, 2017 to Democratic U.S. Senate hopeful Beto O’Rourke, the El Paso congressman. Our ruling Abbott warned in his letter that Soros has spent $1 million to ""install his liberal puppets in positions of power"" in Texas this fall. We confirmed Soros spending in Texas, but he's yet to put a penny toward Democrats seeking state office. The New Yorker gave a little more than $1 million to a committee that helped a challenger win the Democratic nod for Bexar County district attorney. He gave $2,700 to O’Rourke, who went on to win the Democratic Senate nomination. All told, we rate this claim Half True.

Paul Ryan says Democratic leaders are threatening to take away all benefits from tax reform law
","On ""tax day,"" U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan trumpeted what he said are some of the benefits -- in addition to lower taxes -- of the GOP tax reform signed into law in December 2017: Pay raises and bonuses for workers, and companies creating more jobs and bringing home money from overseas. Then the Wisconsin Republican, speaking at an April 17, 2018 news conference, made an attack, saying: Yet, Democratic leaders are still out there spreading doom and gloom. They call it crumbs. They talk about a dark cloud. And they are promising to take it all away. Are they? Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc Pelosi comments 1. To back Ryan’s statement, his campaign staff cited an April 2018 website posting about Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader in the House. It carried this headline: ""Pelosi: Democrats Will Repeal the GOP Tax Law When We Retake the House."" But in the video clip that accompanies the article, Pelosi wasn’t that explicit. Pelosi had been asked at a town hall meeting if Democrats win control of the House in the November 2018 elections, ""will you rewrite the tax bill from scratch, or focus on reversing specific components?"" She replied: We’ll sit down at the table and say, What would be a tax bill that creates growth, that creates good-paying jobs, as it reduces the deficit?...We can do that, we must do that, in a bipartisan way. It’s not about chipping at this piece or that piece, it’s about a comprehensive look at what our tax policy should be for the future. So, Pelosi said she would be willing to work with Republicans on overhauling, or overturning the law, in an unspecified way. 2. Two months earlier, Pelosi did use the word repeal in speaking about Democrats retaking control of the House. But she appeared to be joking, and also spoke of a bipartisan effort. She was asked at a news conference: ""You spoke earlier this week about how, if Democrats take back Congress, that you would want to work on a fair tax system. Tell us a little bit more about what you mean. Is that basically like a repeal and replace of the new tax law?"" Pelosi replied: Well, it may have to be a replace and repeal (chuckles). Replace them (Republicans) and repeal the bill. No, (Rep. Joe Crowley) and Congresswoman Sanchez, they’re on the Ways and Means Committee and I’m going to defer to them on this. But we’ve always said, you can’t do this tax bill without having it being bipartisan. We want to recognize that perhaps we should lower the corporate rate; maybe that’s so, maybe not, what’s the case for it. But if you’re going to have sustainability in a tax reform, it has to be bipartisan. More fact checks on tax reform:   Did Nancy Pelosi vow to raise taxes if Democrats take the U.S. House? Half True.   Does the newly signed Republican tax reform law mean $1,000 or more per year for Americans? Half True. 3. Pelosi’s office, responding to Ryan’s claim, cited a Pelosi statement from a March 2018 news conference as being representative of what she has said on the subject. After repeatedly calling the GOP reform a ""tax scam"" for helping the rich more than the middle class, she said: We would have bipartisan, open hearings on how we go forward.  What’s the appropriate level of a corporate tax cut? How do we first and foremost empower financially the middle class and make that permanent, not treat them as second class people in our country?  Because we said for corporations it’s a permanent tax cut, for people it’s not permanent. And, again, it would be unifying. Unifying. It would be bipartisan, open, transparent, and unifying as we go forward to strengthen middle class tax cuts and to do so in a way that creates good paying jobs, promotes growth and reduces the deficit. So, Pelosi has talked about a comprehensive review of taxes and alluded to repealing the GOP tax reform law. But she has also talked about a corporate tax rate lower than what it was before the reform, and about maintaining tax breaks for the middle class. Schumer comments We also reviewed the statements of the Democratic leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York. 1. At a March 2018 news conference about Democrats’ proposals for infrastructure projects, Schumer spoke about reversing only certain GOP tax reforms, saying: Rather than cutting existing infrastructure projects to pay for a paltry program, we want to roll back the Republican tax giveaways to big corporations and the wealthy, and invest that money instead in job-creating infrastructure. 2. Schumer had gone further shortly after the tax bill’s passage, telling reporters, according to The Hill: There are probably a small number of provisions we might not repeal. It certainly would need drastic overhaul aiming it at the middle class, not the wealthy and powerful. 3. But Schumer’s office told us Democrats only want to roll back provisions for the wealthy and some of those for corporations -- but leave intact tax cuts for workers and the middle class. A summary of the Democrats’ infrastructure proposal would, among other things, restore the top individual tax rate and the estate tax to what they were before the GOP tax reform law, and put the corporate tax rate at 25 percent, up from 21 percent under the GOP law. Schumer emphasized the GOP tax cuts for the rich in saying about the Democratic alternative: We want to roll back the Republican tax giveaways to big corporations and the wealthy and invest that money instead in job-creating infrastructure. So, like Pelosi, Schumer has spoken about resetting the corporate tax rate to lower than it had been before the GOP reform law, but higher than where the reform law put it. Schumer’s emphasis has been on reversing tax breaks for the rich, not for scrapping the entire reform law. Another leader Ryan’s office also pointed out ""tax day"" remarks by U.S. Rep. Joe Crowley of New York, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. He didn’t threaten repeal of the GOP tax reform, but called on Republicans to do so, saying: The Republican caucus needs to announce that it will repeal and replace this bill. This is the bill that needs to be repealed and replaced. They are focused on health care. Repeal this bill, my Republican colleagues. Our rating Ryan says that on the tax reform law, Democratic leaders ""are promising to take it all away."" Democratic leaders in Congress have been harshly critical of the law, and have talked about the need to repeal or at least review most of it. But the tax reform law also provides tax benefits to the middle class, which the Democratic leaders have indicated they want to keep. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.",/factchecks/2018/may/02/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-democratic-leaders-are-threatening-/
"['City Budget', 'Illinois', ""Ja'Mal Green""]","
Does Chicago pay tree trimmers top dollar?
","A community activist hoping to unseat Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel says some workers employed by the department charged with keeping the city clean are making $100,000 or more each year. In taking aim against Emanuel, 22-year-old Ja’Mal Green, a Black Lives Matter activist among a crowded field of potential challengers to the mayor’s re-election next year, is accusing the two-term incumbent of mismanaging city finances. ""We also have to figure out how to be financially sensible on how we’re paying city workers,"" Green said in a recent WBEZ radio interview after questioning Emanuel’s allocation of special funding meant to promote investment in struggling parts of the city. ""We’ve got tree trimmers making six figures."" Green went on to say he wants to save taxpayer dollars so the city can invest in public schools, mental health care services and affordable housing. Progressive messaging aside, however, Green’s claim got us wondering: Does the city really pay some tree trimmers six figures? It’s no secret the city of Chicago has faced scrutiny over high worker pay in recent years. A report by the Better Government Association found the number of city employees making $100,000 or more in base pay nearly doubled between 2013 and 2015, though no tree trimmers were part of that group. Meanwhile, a broader measure examined by the Chicago Sun-Times in 2017 that included overtime as well as base pay found one-third of city employees earned compensation in the six-figures. That report, however, did not highlight specific pay packages of tree trimmers. So where did Green’s numbers come from? When we reached out to his campaign, a spokesman provided us with a list of tree trimmers employed by the city’s Department of Streets and Sanitation making at least $100,000 in total compensation. The spokesman said the names came from a database maintained by OpenTheBooks.com, which is run by Adam Andrzejewski, a self-styled conservative transparency advocate who unsuccessfully sought the 2010 Republican nomination for governor. We found 13 trimmers with total pay listed at $100,000 or more in 2016 on OpenTheBooks.com, the latest year that database covers for the department. The figure includes overtime as well as base pay. Green’s spokesman said his candidate had stressed tree trimmers’ pay in part to draw attention to large sums some city employees are making in overtime. So we turned to 2016 city data to determine how much overtime dollars factored in to those paychecks. City payroll data show that every tree trimmer in the department made between roughly $74,000 and $76,000 in base salary that year, including the top-earning tree trimmers listed on OpenTheBooks.com. A separate city-maintained database measuring overtime catalogued the difference in pay that allowed some to reach six figures. It should be noted that Green’s critique seems somewhat out of sync with his pedigree as a political progressive, a point not lost on some of his allies. Chicago Ald. Ameya Pawar, 47th, a one-time Democratic candidate for governor, called Green out on Twitter, writing it was ""amazing"" to hear someone who had served as a 2016 presidential campaign surrogate for Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders argue to cut public-worker compensation. ""Laborers, tree trimmers, sanitation workers who approach 100k after decades of service aren’t the ones driving income inequality,"" Pawar wrote. Green’s claim about tree trimmers was wrapped in a broader critique of Emanuel’s fiscal leadership. And that’s where the analysis stumbles slightly. The high-earning city tree trimmers Green complains of were all hired well before Emanuel entered office in 2011 and are being paid under contract terms agreed to by the mayor’s predecessors. What’s more, in 2012, Emanuel and the union representing most workers in the Streets and Sanitation department reached a deal to operate under a multi-tiered pay structure that lowered starting pay for new hires by $13 an hour. The same deal also stipulated new workers would be more flexible in job assignments. They would be trained as general laborers able to shift between different tasks rather than as specialists. So all the tree trimmers that showed up in the 2016 employee database referred to by Green were veterans grandfathered into the designation and the higher pay scales associated with it. That said, Emanuel’s administration did retain more control over how much overtime work to dole out. And city data show that overtime spending for tree trimmers soared between 2012, when the cost-saving contract revisions were implemented, and 2016. In 2012, the city paid slightly over $268,000 in overtime for tree trimmers, with the biggest single payout to a worker of roughly $7,500. By 2016, the overtime total had more than tripled to over $907,000, with several workers getting between $24,000 and $32,000. Green claimed that, under Emanuel’s leadership, ""We’ve got tree trimmers making six figures."" Both the source his campaign provided and the city data on which it was based indicate that a handful of tree trimmers employed by the city’s Streets and Sanitation department did make six figures after accounting for overtime pay in 2016, the last year for which all relevant data was available. Still, Green overstepped in ignoring the contract revisions Emanuel’s administration negotiated to gain flexibility in work assignments and reduce base salary for newly hired workers. The designated tree trimmers on the city payroll were all hired before Emanuel took office and get paid under contract terms agreed to years before he became mayor. That said, overtime costs for tree trimmers have soared under Emanuel, and that is why the total compensation for some city tree trimmers has hit the six-figures. Green gets most, but not all of his claim about tree-trimmer pay right, which is why we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/may/01/jamal-green/does-chicago-pay-tree-trimmers-top-dollar/

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Mack was indeed indicted, but the tie to the Rothschilds or Clintons is made up. On Smallville, Mack played the role of Chloe Sullivan, one of Clark Kent’s best friends, starting in 2001. Federal prosecutors in New York announced April 20 that Mack, 35, had been arrested. An unsealed indictment showed she and Keith Raniere faced charges for sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy. Prosecutors said that Mack recruited women to join what was portrayed as a female mentorship group that was led by Raniere. ""The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,"" stated Richard P. Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Raniere established a series of purported self-help programs within his umbrella organization Nxivm, based in Albany. Prosecutors said that Nxivm maintained features of a pyramid scheme, as its courses cost thousands of dollars each and participants (""Nxians"") were encouraged to recruit others. In 2015, Raniere created a secret society within Nxivm called DOS, an acronym that stands for a Latin phrase that loosely translates to ""Lord/Master of the Obedient Female Companions,"" or ""The Vow,"" according to prosecutors. DOS operated with levels of women ""slaves"" headed by ""masters.""   Raniere stood at the top of the pyramid while Mack was one of the women in the first level immediately below Raniere. While The Newly Press article said that Mack confessed, court records show Mack pleaded not guilty on April 20.

Is Michelle Wolf right that Flint still doesn’t have clean water?
","  The remarks by comedian Michelle Wolf at the White House Correspondents' Dinner were intensely scrutinized by journalists, commentators and users of social media. We don’t fact-check jokes, but we did want to look at one line by Wolf that seemed to be dead serious. At the end of her monologue, Wolf said, ""Flint still doesn’t have clean water."" She’s referring to the woes of Flint, Mich., where a switch in water sources was improperly handled, leading to unsafe levels of lead in the city’s water system. We’ve periodically checked in to see how Flint’s water problems are progressing, but the last time we looked was in late 2016. So, now that Wolf has used Flint’s situation as an exclamation point for her high-profile remarks, we decided to gauge whether she’s right that ""Flint still doesn’t have clean water."" Ultimately, we concluded that the reality is more nuanced than Wolf portrayed it. (We reached out to Wolf’s representatives but did not hear back.) Flint is a low-income and majority African-American city beset by a decline in its manufacturing industry. The city’s lead poisoning was precipitated by Gov. Rick Snyder. Snyder, a Republican, had campaigned on his managerial experience and promised to bring outside experts to transform financially languishing municipalities. Under an emergency manager appointed by the state, the city ended its agreement to obtain water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and instead joined a new pipeline project, the Karegnondi Water Authority, that would draw water from Lake Huron. The move, made officially in April 2013, was done in large part to save the city millions of dollars. The day after the switch was announced, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department said it would cut off service in April 2014. Since the pipeline wouldn’t be ready by then, the city prepared to switch its water supply to the Flint River. However, the river water contained salts that would corrode pipes, and the right mix of corrosion inhibitors was never used. Not only did residents complain that their new water was foul, but it eventually became clear that lead was leaching into the water supply from the city’s old pipes. Lead is a highly toxic metal, especially for children whose bodies are still developing. After a litany of missed opportunities, the situation became a focus of the national media in the second half of 2015, prompting both emergency water distribution and a search for a longer-term solution. Flint faces two issues around its water supply: the quality of the water itself, and the effort to remove pipes that contain lead. First, let’s take a look at water quality. By July 2016, the federal Environmental Protection Agency had found significant reductions in lead levels, as long as residents used filters that were provided free of charge. Since then, there have been further improvements. A regulation known as the Federal Lead and Copper Rule set the safe limit for lead in water at 15 parts per billion in 90 percent of samples, using specific testing procedures. Most tests with these procedures in Flint have found that ""lead levels have fallen to legally safe levels,"" said Peggy Kahn, a University of Michigan-Flint political scientist who has closely tracked the issue. Tests conducted in 2017 over a seven-month period by Susan J. Mastern of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Michigan State found lead levels that met the federal standard. Marc Edwards is a Virginia Tech environmental and water resources engineer who leads the Flint Water Study team, which helped identify the problem in the first place. His team also conducted tests in late 2017 and found lead levels below the legal threshold. So there’s solid evidence that Flint’s water is in compliance with federal regulations. That said, no level of lead is truly safe. Even the legal lead level for water does not fully protect children’s health, Kahn said, especially when there are other environmental sources of lead. ""There is no such thing as perfectly safe water anywhere in the U.S.,"" Edwards said. ""Even bottled water sometimes has health risks."" Progress on replacing old, unsafe pipes has been slower. In March 2016, Flint began to rip out and replace some of the hazardous pipes under a ""FAST Start program."" That program continues. Kristin Moore, a Flint city government spokeswoman, said that 6,264 pipes have been replaced as of April 18, 2018. However, an estimated 12,000 Flint residences still have lead and galvanized service lines that need to be replaced, she said. ""The pipe replacement work is expected to be completed by 2020,"" Moore said. ""However, the mayor is hopeful that the project can be completed even sooner."" One factor slowing the work is that ""individual home tests may vary even within the same neighborhood,"" due to differences in how the original pipes were laid, said Kimberly Saks McManaway, director of the master’s of public administration program at the University of Michigan-Flint. The consensus we found is that the water quality in Flint is greatly improved, but the city is not out of the woods yet. ""While progress indeed continues to be made in Flint, Mayor Karen Weaver has said that there are still issues that must be addressed,"" said Moore, the city spokeswoman. She said residents are urged to drink water that is filtered and to keep their filters properly maintained, adding ""some with health issues or compromised immune systems may be advised by medical professionals to drink bottled water."" That said, Flint’s water quality now exceeds that of other cities with old water pipes, Edwards said. Kahn agreed that there has been ""great improvement"" compared to the worst of the crisis. However, she added that ""there are still significant safety concerns, and there is a deep level of mistrust in view of some of the recent testing results and warnings, terrible past damage, unresponsiveness, and cover-ups."" Wolf said, ""Flint still doesn’t have clean water."" In reality, testing in recent months has repeatedly shown that Flint’s water meets federal standards. At the same time, the city won’t be fully safe until its old pipes are all replaced, which is currently estimated to happen in 2020. Considerable hurdles remain for Flint, but Wolf’s statement glossed over the significant progress made in water quality since the worst of the crisis.

Is unemployment at a record low under Florida Gov. Rick Scott?
","The U.S. Chamber of Commerce praised Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s economic achievements in an ad supporting his bid for U.S. Senate against Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson. The 30-second ad knocks Nelson for voting against the 2017 tax cut bill while highlighting Scott’s efforts to cut taxes (""40 times!"") and create jobs. ""Scott has cut red tape for better innovation, and our unemployment is at a record low,"" speakers say in the ad. At 3.9 percent in March, Florida’s unemployment rate is at its lowest point since before Scott took office. But it is not at an all-time low. The unemployment rate has been lower several times since 1976, right up to the burst of the housing bubble in 2007. The ad cites a March Washington Examiner story. Headlined, ""Four states hit record low unemployment in February,"" the article singles out California, Maine, Mississippi and Wisconsin as reaching record-low unemployment rates. The story discussed Florida, the third-largest state, with a more qualified point: ""It's not just small states. Texas is near record-low unemployment. Florida unemployment, at 3.9 percent, is near as low as it's ever been outside the years of the housing bubble."" We turned to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics to get a better understanding of Florida’s unemployment history. Florida’s unemployment rate has held at 3.9 percent since September 2017 through March 2018, the latest month for which we have data. We confirmed that Florida’s unemployment rate has been lower than or equal to 3.9 percent several times in the last 20 years. We counted 43 months from 1998 to 2018 with unemployment rates below 3.9 percent. In late 1999 and early 2000, Florida’s unemployment was between 3.7 to 3.9 percent, based on seasonally adjusted data. From 2005 to 2007, Florida’s unemployment rate wavered between 3.1 to 3.9 percent. The rate climbed to a peak of 11.3 percent in January 2010 before falling during the years of the national economic recovery. A U.S. Chamber of Commerce ad said Florida’s unemployment is at a record low. The rate is the lowest since April 2007, but it is not a record low. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the unemployment rate was lower multiple times between 1999 and 2007.

Fake story says CNN fired journalist for making fun of Trump's spokeswoman
","An online hoax smashed together a 2015 comment by Donald Trump and a comedian’s roast of the Trump administration to make up a story about CNN. ""CNN shocks America, fires ‘journalist’ who made fun of Sarah Sanders’ face,"" said an April 29 headline by Daily World Update. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. On April 28, comedian Michelle Wolf hosted the annual White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner in which she made fun of press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Part of Wolf’s remarks were interpreted as a jab at Sanders’ appearance; she indirectly referred to her as a softball coach dividing the press corps into teams, and that Sanders ""burns facts, and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye."" Trump, as well as some members of the press association, criticized Wolf’s remarks. The Daily World Update wrote that Marvin Schmidt, a supposed former CNN co-host, was fired after he defended Wolf’s remarks. ""Look at that face,"" Schmidt said in an alleged now-deleted tweet, The Daily World Update wrote. ""I mean, she’s a woman and I’m not supposed to say bad things but really folks, come on! Are we serious?"" That quote was actually made by Trump in a Rolling Stone interview in 2015 when speaking about GOP presidential contender Carly Fiorina. ""Look at that face!"" he cries. ""Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!"" The laughter grows halting and faint behind him. ""I mean, she's a woman, and I'm not s'posedta say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?"" CNN has no co-host named Marvin Schmidt, a CNN spokeswoman Barbara Levin told PolitiFact. She said the story was fabricated. The Daily World Update story includes a photo of three people on CNN, including a black man in the middle with a red circle drawn around his face suggesting that he was the alleged Schmidt who was fired. We searched for the photo in Google Images and found that it matched a panel of guests on CNN in February 2016 about the reaction to Beyonce’s album Formation. The black man on the panel was Bakari Sellers, a CNN commentator and a former South Carolina state representative. Sellers told PolitiFact that he hasn’t spoken on CNN about Wolf’s speech to the White House Correspondents Association. The Daily World Update describes itself as satire. But this story hardly meets that definition. The website is linked to a frequent purveyor of such hoaxes, Christopher Blair, who says he creates fake stories to make money.  The post Facebook users see would give little clue to the fact that the story is made up.  The Daily World Update wrote that ""CNN shocks America, fires ‘journalist’ who made fun of Sarah Sanders’ face."" The story said that Marvin Schmidt was fired by CNN, but there is no co-host at CNN by that name. The story said Schmidt tweeted an insult about Sanders’ appearance, but the actual quote came from Trump in 2015 about Carly Fiorina.

Donald Trump says US spent $7 trillion on Middle East wars. A lot of that money has not been spent
","At a campaign-style event in Washington, Mich., President Donald Trump upped the ante on the costs of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. When running for president in 2016, Trump said America had spent $6 trillion on its response to the Sept. 11 terror attacks. In Michigan, he added another trillion. ""We have spent $7 trillion — trillion with a T — $7 trillion in the Middle East,"" he told the crowd April 28, 2018. ""You know what we have for it? Nothing. Nothing."" We found that Trump inaccurately treated money that university researchers have predicted will be spent decades in the future as if it were already spent. The White House pointed to a couple of studies to back up Trump’s number. A 2016 analysis from a Boston University political scientist Neta Crawford calculated that by August 2016, the United States had ""already appropriated, spent, or taken on obligations to spend more than $3.6 trillion in current dollars on the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria and on Homeland Security."" But after adding an estimated $1 trillion for the future cost of treating wounded veterans through 2053, plus money for the Defense Department to fight wars, the total reached nearly $4.8 trillion. Crawford’s paper included this table:  In the last row of her table, Crawford adds about $3 trillion in cumulative interest to reach a figure of nearly $8 trillion — over 35 years. She told us she used unpublished projections from the economist who wrote a 2011 paper on the macroeconomic impacts of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The estimated future cost of veteran care and debt service also played a role in a 2013 Harvard Kennedy School working paper that estimated long-term costs of $4 trillion to $6 trillion. ""The largest portion of that bill is yet to be paid,"" the authors wrote. The key costs in the years ahead were veterans care, replacing military hardware, and interest on the debt that financed the fighting. According to the Congressional Budget Office, recent tax and spending bills make rising debt more likely in the years ahead, adding weight to the projected finance costs associated with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The authors of both papers acknowledge that there are large uncertainties in predicting costs so many years in the future. Looking at direct spending, the Congressional Research Service estimated in 2014 that the Iraq and Afghanistan wars had cost the United States about $1.6 trillion from 2001 to 2014. That figure did not include ongoing care for veterans. Trump said that America has spent $7 trillion on the Middle East. The key flaw is Trump treated long-range estimates as money already spent. The money actually spent so far is closer to $2 trillion. The reports cited by the White House estimated costs about 30 years into the future. The highest estimate in those reports supports Trump’s $7 trillion figure. Still, wounded veterans will need care and debt must be repaid with interest.

Alabama ranks lowest by state and local tax revenue per capita
","Democratic candidate Sue Bell Cobb made a bold claim about the poor state of Alabama’s budget at the governor’s debate on April 24, 2018. Cobb, former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice, was responding to a moderator’s question about whether she would consider raising taxes. Cobb said she would present the Legislature ""a modest but adequate increase in our fuel tax"" to repair the state’s crumbling infrastructure. The reason? ""Alabama is operating government on the lowest amount of tax revenue of any state in the nation, which is why we’re lagging behind our sister southern states,"" she said. Our fact-checker ears perk up with superlatives like this one. For this fact-check, we wanted to answer whether Alabama has the lowest amount of tax revenue in the United States. We found it does. Alabama ranks 51st out of 50 states and the District of Columbia for state and local tax collections per capita. In fiscal year 2015, the latest year for which Census data was available, Alabama collected $3,141 per capita. ""You’ll notice that Alabama comes in dead last in total per-capita tax collections,"" said Cobb campaign manager Landon Nichols. The highest? The District of Columbia at $10,605 per capita. Richard Auxier, a research associate at the Tax Policy Center, doubted rankings would change much with 2017 numbers. He agreed with the per-capita measurement for state-by-state comparisons. Alabama ranks toward the bottom by other revenue measurements, too. When you count only state taxes, Alabama ranks 41st with $2,041 per capita. That was in fiscal year 2016. Taxes aren’t the only way states raise revenue. In terms of own-source revenue — which includes highway tolls, state university tuition, public hospital payments and other fees and transfers in addition to taxes raised by Alabama — the state ranks 44th. And when we looked at the gas tax, which Cobb suggested raising, Alabama ranks 37th, according to the Tax Foundation. In a 2016 study, the Tax Policy Institute found Alabama’s total tax revenue is below average. The reason is a combination of low wealth levels and relatively low taxes. By household median income, Alabama ranks 46th. While Alabama has a low top-income tax rate, sales taxes are relatively high. As Cobb suggested, total tax revenue falls short. The Tax Policy Institute study found that to fund spending programs following national averages, Alabama would need $9,092 per capita. Cobb said, ""Alabama is operating government on the lowest amount of tax revenue of any state in the nation, which is why we’re lagging behind our sister southern states."" Alabama indeed fell last in per-capita tax collections for state and local taxes. It ranked toward the bottom in other measurements of government revenue, not the very bottom.

Don Blankenship claims illegal immigration costs $130 billion a year. Is that true?
","Seeking to represent West Virginia in the U.S. Senate, former coal mining executive Don Blankenship called for an end to illegal immigration, saying it costs billions of dollars a year. ""We have to stop illegal immigration, costing us $130 billion a year to house and feed and give benefits to people that shouldn’t be even in the country,"" Blankenship said during an April 23 debate among Republican primary candidates. We wanted to know the facts behind Blankenship’s claim on the cost of illegal immigration. Blankenship’s statement stems from a report by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) that said illegal immigration costs about $135 billion a year. The group favors stricter immigration policies. The report has drawn criticism for some of its assumptions, such as a higher-than-usual estimate of immigrants in the country illegally (12.5 million, higher than the typically reported 11 million) and for excluding tax contributions made by U.S.-born children to parents here illegally. Overall, it’s difficult to determine a precise cost of illegal immigration due to lack of reliable data.  FAIR’s report said illegal immigration costs about $135 billion a year, and that immigrants who are here illegally contribute about $19 billion in taxes annually. That puts net costs at about $116 billion a year. Blankenship said illegal immigration must be stopped because it costs $130 billion a year to house, feed and give benefits to people who shouldn’t even be in the United States. But FAIR’s report did not include estimates for the cost of public housing benefits, citing a lack of reliable information. The group also noted most welfare programs are not available to immigrants in the country illegally. But the group factored in costs for programs that benefit children born in the United States to parents here illegally. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, criticized FAIR for calculating welfare used by U.S.-born children, but failing to add in their potential tax contributions once they start working. ""Counting the benefits consumed but ignoring the tax revenue they pay (or will do so in the future) is one way FAIR gets such a negative result for this report,"" Nowrasteh wrote in a September 2017 post enumerating flaws in the report. FAIR estimated that the welfare of illegal immigration amounts to about $5.8 billion a year at the federal level and $2.9 billion a year at the state level (including school meals and child care programs). We asked more experts about the validity of FAIR’s findings. Their estimate is reasonable, though the cost could be more or could be less, said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low-immigration levels. Even though most immigrants living illegally in the United States come to work and pay billions in taxes, that does not make them a net fiscal benefit, Camarota said. Other experts said there were flaws. For one, the report’s bottom line included federal immigration enforcement costs. ""It seems ridiculous to attribute the costs of border security to unauthorized immigrants. Would people prefer we had no border security so then the costs of unauthorized immigration would be lower?"" said Madeline Zavodny, an immigration expert and economics professor at the University of North Florida. Enforcement is aimed not only at reducing unauthorized immigration but also at reducing drug smuggling and trafficking, Zavodny said. Kim Rueben, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said, ""They are doing things in a way to try to exaggerate what the possible cost could be."" FAIR also factored in about $3.5 billion for assumed Medicaid fraud.  We’ve fact-checked several other claims about the cost of illegal immigration based on FAIR’s reports, with experts raising concerns about their methodology and assumptions. In 2016, we rated Mostly False a claim from then-presidential candidate Donald Trump when he claimed that illegal immigration cost the United States more than $113 billion a year, finding that he selected the highest of all possible estimates from a range that varied widely. Blankenship said, ""We have to stop illegal immigration, costing us $130 billion a year to house and feed and give benefits to people that shouldn’t be even in the country."" Immigrants in the country illegally generate costs for taxpayers, but it’s difficult to determine a precise figure largely because there isn’t reliable data. Blankenship’s claim is based on a 2017 FAIR report estimating illegal immigration cost about $135 billion a year. Experts picked apart many aspects of the report’s methodology. But relevant to Blankenship’s statement, the group’s estimate did not factor in housing costs. For all welfare costs brought on by illegal immigration, FAIR calculated about $5.8 billion a year at the federal level and $2.9 billion a year at the state level (including school meals and child care programs). Blankenship’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/apr/30/don-blankenship/don-blankenship-claims-illegal-immigration-costs-1/
