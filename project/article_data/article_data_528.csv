Rep. Chris Taylor says the State Capitol rotunda was designed to accomodate protests
","Members of the the Russian punk band Pussy Riot helped breathe new fire into longstanding controversy surrounding the arrests of hundreds of protesters at the Wisconsin State Capitol. Band members Nadya Tolokonnikova and Masha Alyokhina, who served time in a Russian prison after criticizing President Vladimir Putin in a 2012 performance, declared ""Solidarity with Wisconsin!"" in a video that argues for the dismissal of tickets issued to those who participated in noon hour singalongs at the Capitol. The daily singalongs are an outgrowth of the massive protests that engulfed the Capitol in early 2011 after Gov. Scott Walker unveiled his plan to curtail collective bargaining for most public employees. In the summer of 2013, Capitol Police began arresting protesters in large numbers. Some protesters were arrested dozens of times, and hundreds of tickets -- mostly civil rather than criminal forfeitures -- were written. State officials said the singers had gathered illegally without a permit. Two protesters, with help from the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin, sued Gov. Scott Walker’s administration, claiming the arrests violated the singers’ right to free speech. In July 2013, U.S. District Judge William Conley issued a preliminary injunction blocking two parts of the restrictions on demonstrations, but left in place the rules requiring permits for larger gatherings. The singing and the arrests continued. With the free speech case heading for a trial, the state and the singers reached an agreement in October 2013. The state agreed to pay more than $88,000 in attorneys fees and drop its requirement that larger groups receive a permit before staging protests in the Capitol. The agreement said protesters could stage five days of demonstrations if they gave the state two days’ advance notice. At the time, Larry Dupuis, legal director of the ACLU of Wisconsin said: ""Giving notice is very informal. The state can't deny use of the Capitol to anyone giving notice, unless someone else has reserved the entire space by obtaining a permit for the same time."" A total of 504 tickets were written. Of those, 192 have been dismissed, 11 found guilty, 28 were settled through deferred prosecution and two were declined by prosecutors, and two settled with a default judgment, according to Dana Brueck, spokeswoman for Attorney Gen. J.B. Van Hollen. That leaves 269 tickets to be settled. And that was the purpose behind the six-minute video, released March 11, 2014. It argues that the protesters were simply exercising their right to free speech by singing. State Rep. Chris Taylor (D-Madison) leads off with this statement: ""The Capitol rotunda was actually made to invite the people in and to accommodate protests."" Is Taylor right? About the building While Taylor argues the Capitol was actually designed for protests and gatherings, the state has argued it is primarily a place of business. That’s the approach Van Hollen took in 2012 brief filed in a Dane County Circuit Court case. ""The prime use of the State Capitol is as an office building and a place for orderly legislative and judicial hearings on the most important issues of the day — not as an open public square,"" Van Hollen argued. He cited this comment from Secretary of Administration Michael Huebsch from an earlier case: ""It is primarily the facility by which the Legislature, the Judicial, and the Executive Branches are able to conduct their business and do what they have been duly elected to carry out."" In an email, DOA spokesman Stephanie Marquis cited the state’s Administrative Code, which says state buildings are available for a variety of uses, including ""public meetings for the free discussion of public questions"" providing the use doesn’t interfere with the prime uses of the building, doesn’t create a management problem, involve damages and is appropriate to the physical context of the building or facility."" She also cited the history of the Capitol, including various moves and expansions made to handle the growth of state government: ""The history talks about the purpose of the building is to conduct State and legislative business."" Taylor’s case But Taylor’s argument is that the building was designed with a broader purpose in mind.  Aide Craig Trost said she based her comments about the Capitol on part of Conley’s ruling. In his ruling, Conley described the Capitol, and especially the soaring rotunda, as a special place. He cited the June 10, 2000 nomination of the building for inclusion on the National Registry of Historic Places. The nomination, which was successful, was prepared by architectural historian Anne Biebel, who was part of the team that worked on a major restoration project that had been completed. The nomination noted that there is a ""clear demarcation between public and private spaces, (that) is central to the development of (Capitol architect George Browne)  Post’s scheme for the Capitol interior. The public spaces, such as the rotunda, chambers and major corridors, are monumental in scale and are characterized by ornate decoration, rich materials and lavish details. The private offices, designed with the goal of making them adaptable to changing needs, are constructed at a smaller and more intimate scale."" Conley noted: ""Whereas some statehouses are maintained apart from the urban fabric, the Wisconsin Capitol Rotunda functions, both literally and symbolically, as a city center and is fully utilized as a public space to which all have claim."" Later in his ruling, the judge noted: ""The Capitol rotunda is closer to an out-of-doors, traditional public forum in that it is a capacious gathering space with a unique history as a place for government and public discourse, which admits for (indeed, was designed for) a certain level of disturbance that would not be proper in a typical state office building or even a typical state capitol."" Conley’s ruling also noted that the rotunda is the location of the state’s holiday tree, and the setting for numerous events and ceremonies. Our rating In the video, Taylor said the building was designed for such public gatherings. While it is a place of business, the building’s nomination for National Historic Landmark makes clear that it was designed to be open to the public for various gatherings.

Carville: Insurance risk corridors aren't going broke like Republicans predicted
","It will be some time before we know how the Affordable Care Act actually works in practice. The initial enrollment period has ended more or less. Now we wait to see how many people pay their premiums, how much the insurance companies pay out in claims and tally what the expansion of Medicaid did for the working poor. Yet partisans on both sides seem unable to resist the temptation to declare success or failure based on what we know today. Democratic strategist James Carville succumbed to excessive exuberance during an exchange on ABC’s This Week with conservative radio show host Laura Ingraham. Carville ribbed Ingraham over the doom and gloom predictions of Republicans. ""Y’all said it would collapse,"" he said. ""You said no one would sign up. You said it would cost part-time jobs."" And then he added, ""You said the risk corridors were going to go broke. None of it has happened. Get over it. It’s working."" That last point touches a nerve in certain GOP quarters. Leading voices like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, have been waving a red flag, warning that Obamacare has a built-in bailout for health insurance companies. Part of that alleged bailout comes in the shape of risk corridors. For this fact-check, we’ll assess whether the insurance risk corridors aren't going broke as Republicans predicted. It’s pretty technical and obscure but here’s what the fuss is about. Managing carrier jitters The Affordable Care Act does a complete number on the insurance game as Americans know it, at least in the individual and small group markets. Instead of companies making a profit through selling policies to the healthy and avoiding the ill, the law aims to pull carriers into a world where they insure everyone and compete based on efficiency and value. We’re not saying that will necessarily happen, but that’s the goal. In sickness and health and everything in between, that’s the population the insurers must work with. The problem is, if you are an insurance company, how do you decide how much to charge in such a different landscape? Until you have a few years to see who you’re insuring and how much health care they use, the uncertainty is way beyond your comfort zone. Enter the government and a few tricks to spread both possible losses and windfall profits among insurance companies and between all insurance companies and the government. One of those devices is called risk corridors. Risk corridors are a temporary program that cover the first three years of the health care law -- 2014-16.  Here’s how it works. The government sets financial benchmarks for each plan offered on the marketplace. As long as insurers come close to that benchmark, nothing happens. If an insurer overperforms by up to 3 percent, they can keep the extra revenue. If they underperform by up to 3 percent, they are forced to absorb those additional costs. When the gaps get wider, however, money starts changing hands. If insurers beat their benchmark by 3-8 percent, they have to split that extra revenue with the federal government. If insurers beat the mark by more than 8 percent, the government receives 80 percent of that additional money. On the flip side, when insurers fail to meet their benchmarks, the government helps absorb those costs. If insurers underperform by 3-8 percent, the government will cover half the extra cost. The government covers 80 percent of losses bigger than that. A matter of timing As you probably can guess, nothing actually happens until the insurance companies wrap up the year. They have to tally up the premiums they collected and compare those to the claims they paid out. The very earliest they could do that would be January 2015, but they have until the end of July 2015 to submit their data to Washington. Melinda Buntin chairs the Department of Health Policy at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Buntins said it’s too early to draw any conclusions. ""With people just enrolling now, we don’t know how the risk corridors will play out,"" Buntin said. A Carville assistant told us Carville relied on the latest numbers from the government’s nonpartisan bean counters, the Congressional Budget Office. In February, the CBO predicted that the total package of risk adjustment programs (that includes the corridors and two other programs) will generate revenue for the government. CBO analysts think Washington will gain about $8 billion over the three years the programs are active. However, while those projections undercut the fears expressed by people like Rubio and Kristol, they remain just that -- projections. Carville was drawing real-world conclusions in his remarks. Our ruling Carville said that Republican fears of big payouts under the risk corridors have not come to pass. Carville was claiming victory before any numbers are in. We won’t know for sure whether government gained, lost or broke even with the risk corridors until 2014 is over. The CBO projections suggest little reason for concern. If they had gone the other way, that would undermine Carville’s case, but they are not the final proof. Carville’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/apr/13/james-carville/carville-insurance-risk-corridors-arent-going-brok/

Ingraham: Obamacare 'is costing 2 million jobs'
","The Sunday morning TV pundits revived some passionate talking points about the health care law following this week’s resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. Look to the partisan bickering between Democratic strategist James Carville and conservative radio host Laura Ingraham on ABC’s This Week to see what we mean.   Carville said Sebelius’ departure doesn’t change the fact that the law is working. ""You know what? Y’all said it was gonna collapse. You said no one would sign up. You said it was going to cost part-time jobs -- "" ""It’s costing 2 million jobs,"" Ingraham jumped in, attributing the figure to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Carville kept talking: ""You said the risk corridors were going to go broke. None of that has happened. Get over it. It’s working. It’s gonna work."" PunditFact checks out Carville’s point on risk corridors here. In this fact-check, we focused on Ingraham’s point about a CBO report that analyzed the health care law’s long-term effect on employment. Fact-checkers have heard Obamacare critics misrepresent the report many, many times. When the CBO released this report in February, House Speaker John Boehner and Fox News host Gretchen Carlson jumped out in front with some poor interpretations of this paragraph from CBO: ""The reduction in CBO's projections of hours worked represents a decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024,"" the nonpartisan research service wrote. At first blush, that may seem to match what Ingraham said about the law ""costing 2 million jobs."" But the losses CBO projected aren’t exactly full-time jobs, and they aren’t driven by employers laying off employees. Essentially, some workers are expected to voluntarily dial back their hours. Or as the CBO put it: ""The estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply, rather than from a net drop in businesses’ demand for labor."" It’s an important distinction. CBO estimated that millions of Americans will probably decide they don’t need to work as much because the law makes health insurance more available by offering subsidies for some to obtain insurance and expanding Medicaid eligibility in some states. CBO found the tax penalties imposed on employers that do not provide insurance to their workers and new taxes on labor income would have a smaller effect on the labor market than the Medicaid expansion and exchange subsidies. Just as important, CBO’s 2 million ""full-time-equivalent workers"" figure is not a dressed-up word for 2 million full-time jobs. CBO did not break down how many full-time jobs would be reduced under the law versus employees simply working fewer hours, dropping a separate part-time job, or leaving the workforce. ""Because some people will reduce the amount of hours they work rather than stopping work altogether, the number who will choose to leave employment because of the ACA in 2024 is likely to be substantially less than 2.5 million,"" the report states. ""At the same time, more than 2.5 million people are likely to reduce the amount of labor they choose to supply to some degree because of the ACA, even though many of them will not leave the labor force entirely."" None of this is to say the health care law is not affecting the job market. Analysts expect the country’s labor force participation rate to fall over the coming decade, and some people may not like the idea that people would work fewer hours because they can obtain government-subsidized insurance. ""Bigger implicit and explicit tax distortions are reducing productive economic activity,"" Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California-Berkeley, told us in February. Lastly, researchers said the law’s biggest effects on employment would happen after 2016, when more provisions have taken effect, so the estimate is not a present-day reflection as Ingraham makes it sound. CBO researchers also note total employment and compensation will increase over the next decade, but ""that increase will be smaller than it would have been in the absence of the ACA."" Our ruling We are fact-checkers, not fortune-tellers. We’ll steer clear of declaring the health care law a success or failure. For one, it’s simply too soon to tell. It is possible to say, however, whether pundits are accurately summarizing projections from nonpartisan government analysts about the law. And when Ingraham cited CBO for her claim that the law ""is costing 2 million jobs,"" she glazed over a swath of important details. Ingraham’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. (Update April 15: Ingraham responded to our ruling on her April 14, radio show, saying: ""The economy is affected when fewer people work. This is a real effect on the real American economy. So you can argue about how you interpret the number of jobs lost. You can say that's a good thing. ... Democrats love when people aren't working. ...That does not change the underlying fact that jobs will be lost because of Obamacare. PolitiFact and the Democrats think it's a good idea to add to those terrible (jobs) numbers with more people not working. And you're going to fact-check me? Fact-check this. Fact-check yourself.

Mary Burke says Scott Walker left Wisconsin women without equal pay protections
","Democratic candidate for governor Mary Burke minced no words on Equal Pay Day, April 8, 2014, charging that Gov. Scott Walker has left women behind in the Wisconsin workplace. ""Following Scott Walker's repeal in 2012 of protections against gender discrimination, Wisconsin is now one of just five states without an equal pay law,"" the Madison School Board member said in a media statement. Burke pledged to reinstate Wisconsin’s 2009 Equal Pay Enforcement Act, saying that in Wisconsin, ""a woman only earns $0.80 for every dollar a man earns, and pay discrimination doesn't just hurt our families, it hurts our economies too."" The former Trek Bicycle executive also sent supporters an email saying that due to Walker’s action, Wisconsin now is ""without an equal pay law protecting women from gender discrimination in their paycheck."" In bringing up Walker’s repeal of the 2009 law, Burke echoed Democratic Party attacks that Republicans are conducting a ""war on women."" Is Burke on target in saying that Wisconsin women are working without an anti-discrimination safety net? Before we dive in, we should note that several federal laws give Wisconsin women a way to pursue cases of pay discrimination. It seems clear, though, that Burke was talking about state-level laws that are separate from the federal laws. So that’s what we’ll examine. Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki pointed us to research posted online by the National Conference of State Legislatures, which concluded that Wisconsin, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Utah lack equal-pay laws. That nugget was picked up by the Washington Post and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in March 2014. How did the group come to that conclusion? The NCSL told us they searched an online legal research service for terms such as ""equal pay"" and got no hits for Wisconsin. But Wisconsin has a longstanding law by another name, the state Fair Employment Act, which explicitly prohibits gender-based employment discrimination ""in promotion (and) compensation paid for equal or substantially similar work."" Attorneys on both sides of discrimination cases told us the state’s Fair Employment Act allows people who believe they’ve faced pay discrimination to seek back wages and legal fees from their employers through a state administrative hearing process. So what was the 2009 law passed by Democrats then in full control of the Capitol? That legislation, approved by then-Gov. Jim Doyle, sought to expand the state penalties employers could face if found guilty of discrimination against women and other protected groups on pay or other employment issues. Democrats, women’s professional groups and plaintiff’s lawyers had argued that the Fair Employment law needed more teeth (while Republican opponents said businesses would see more frivolous lawsuits). So the 2009 bill allowed persons to sue in court -- and get compensatory and punitive damages -- after they had exhausted their administrative cases in the state Department of Workforce Development. But that 2009 law -- the one repealed in 2012 by Walker and Republicans -- was a fairly narrow one focused on tougher enforcement of existing protections for women and other groups. It did not establish a new set of equal-pay protections -- those already were in the Fair Employment law, where they have been since 1982 and where they remained even after the 2012 repeal. ""The bill will help all workers who are already protected under Wisconsin’s Fair Employment Law to fight these kinds of discrimination,"" state Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee), a co-sponsor, said in 2009. She added: ""The bill does not create any protected new groups, just backs up those who, despite current law, are still unfairly denied work, fired from work or compensated less than others for the same work."" All of that history undermines Burke’s sweeping claim. States have changed laws There’s another angle here. It’s tougher on employees to win under Wisconsin law than in some other states where workers can turn to state statutes written more explicitly to require equal pay for equal work, said Janet Heins, managing partner of a Mequon law firm that represents workers. States have adopted those measures in recent years under the heading of ""Equal Pay"" laws. One result: some states, mirroring federal laws, require only that employees prove unequal pay for equal work instead of showing that employers had a discriminatory motive, said Heins. Ronald Stadler, who defends employers accused of discrimination, agreed but noted that the 2009 Wisconsin law changes did not alter the standard for proving discrimination. Instead, those changes focused on adding remedies such as punitive damages that are already in federal laws. Wisconsin sought in its 2009 ""equal pay enforcement"" changes to make the state process more appealing and available to employees, in part because its more affordable than filing a federal action. Many state-law claimants proceed without an attorney. In Stadler’s view, the bottom line is that Wisconsin women have a state-law course of action on pay discrimination despite what he called a semantic difference. ""We don’t have an ‘equal pay act,’ but we have a ‘fair employment act’ that says you can’t have one male and one female at different pay rates for same job,"" Stadler, a Milwaukee attorney, said. Heins thinks it’s a ""tricky"" question to answer, but believes it’s technically accurate to say there’s no state ""equal pay"" law. Without tougher remedies, some would-be plaintiffs may not be pursuing state claims because it does not make financial sense, Heins said. Burke portrays the 2009 changes as major. But they were repealed before that could be determined, Heins and Stadler said. Heins said that workers’ attorneys may have gained a bit more leverage over employers to settle more cases under the changes. The number of cases that go to state administrative law hearings is not large and most are settled privately, are withdrawn or dismissed for various reasons, according to numbers provided by state Workforce Development officials. In gender pay cases from January 2011 to April 2014 that got to the hearing stage, judges found discrimination in three cases, no discrimination in one and another 33 were settled privately. About 35 other complaints were dismissed, withdrawn or the judges affirmed an earlier finding of no probable cause. Earlier ratings We examined similar statement by Democrats in March 2012 when Republicans were repealing the 2009 change. State Rep. Cory Mason (D-Racine) said the GOP bill would repeal a law that ensures ""that women cannot get paid less than a man for doing the same job."" We rated that Mostly False, noting the 2009 law did not ensure pay equity, but rather gave discriminated workers the right to sue in state court for compensatory and punitive damages. And we rated False a claim by Kathleen Falk, Democrat running for governor, that Wisconsin women facing pay discrimination ""can’t do something about it"" under the repeal bill passed by Republicans. We noted that women suffering pay discrimination could still file a state or federal complaint in an effort to be made whole. And they could still seek larger monetary damages by suing in federal court. As for Burke’s claim, there’s a case to be made that Walker’s 2012 action filed down some of the (potentially) sharp new teeth put into the law in 2009. But Burke goes much further, saying that thanks to the governor, Wisconsin is ""without an equal pay law."" This is highly misleading. Our rating Burke said that Walker’s repeal of a 2009 law has left Wisconsin as ""just one of five states without an equal pay law protecting women from gender discrimination in their paycheck."" But while Walker reversed an attempt to toughen up Wisconsin law, its protections against gender discrimination in workplace pay date back decades. The governor’s 2012 action left those in place, albeit without tougher penalties for employers. We rate Burke’s claim False.",/factchecks/2014/apr/13/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-scott-walker-left-wisconsin-women-/

Michael Stenhouse: grant of $5,000 went to teaching business employee how to use social media
","Michael Stenhouse, CEO of the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity, a conservative think tank, and David Williams, president of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, are on a quest to reduce the cost of government. On April 2, 2014, they released a report listing concrete ways to save nearly $225 million in what they view as wasteful and unnecessary spending in Gov. Lincoln Chafee's proposed budget. In a commentary published that day in The Providence Journal, they listed some eye-catching examples. One was to save $8.4 million by eliminating the Governor’s Workforce Board, saying that despite the claim that it ""helps to develop a more skilled and better prepared workforce . . . . there is little indication that the board provides any value to workers, businesses, or taxpayers. In the past year, the Governor’s Workforce Board gave out a number of outlandish grants."" Stenhouse and Williams cited two examples. One in particular caught our eye: ""A grant for $5,000 went to teach an employee at a company that makes ornamental business card holders how to use Facebook and Twitter."" That's an eye-catching claim, and several media outlets quoted it. We were intrigued -- $5,000 to teach one person how to use two immensely popular social media websites? That certainly seemed to qualify as outlandish. We put on our fact-checking hats and tried to learn more. Our first stop: the report released by Stenhouse's and Williams' organizations. It says that the board spent ""$5,000 to provide social media training for employees at Ahler's Designs."" It linked to a document from the board saying that the training was for three employees -- not one -- plus one student. When we asked Stenhouse about the discrepancy, he contended that he said ""an employee,"" in the commentary, not ""one person."" We don’t see the difference. Stenhouse also said he forwarded our query to Williams, who did not  respond to us. So was the $5,000 spent to teach people about Twitter and Facebook? Yes. And more. According to the grant contract, it covered part of the cost of 32 hours of social media training, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Google+ and YouTube. It also covered 20 hours of ""sales and process"" training at Ahlers, a Pawtucket-based company that creates gifts and awards that are hand-crafted in Rhode Island. Rick Brooks, executive director of the Workforce Board, said such grants are designed to improve the skills of current and future workers, and only cover part of the training costs. ""We want the business to have some skin in the game,"" he said. The grants come from the Job Development Fund, which is financed by the payroll tax the state levies on business to cover unemployment insurance. ""The money comes from businesses and we make the money available to businesses,"" said Brooks. In this case, Ahlers Designs asked for help in underwriting its training costs because it was trying to shift its business to focus on custom artwork for individuals and corporations. It needed to train more people in sales and marketing, a job mostly done by CEO Gail Ahlers, according to Ahlers and her grant application. Companies also get a bigger grant if they agree to set up internships, which Ahlers did, training two students, not just the one that it promised to do. That's five people trained with the grant. Both Brooks and Ahlers argued that social media skills are crucial to helping a business succeed in the Internet age, and they involve a lot more than finding friends on Facebook. There are tricks to getting your products listed ahead of others in a Google search, techniques to avoid being smeared online by competitors, and special rules that have to be followed if you're trying to market something on a social media site. ""Knowing how to use Facebook for sales is a different skill set"" than simply being a casual user, said Brooks. In his email, Stenhouse said, ""Taxpayer dollars being spent on something that millions have figured out for themselves is outrageous. We question, however, the public service value of fact-checking the semantic difference between 'an employee' and 'employees’ when a much larger public policy question is at the core of the issue."" ""Aren't we trying to retrain people so we can keep the jobs? And it's the small companies that really need the help so they can hire more people,"" Ahlers responded. We'll let others debate whether state funds should be spent on this type of training -- or any training at all. PolitiFact focuses on whether politicians, advocates and pundits can get their facts straight. Our ruling Michael Stenhouse and his coauthor, David Williams, made this provocative claim: ""A grant for $5,000 [from the Governor’s Workforce Board] went to teach an employee at a company that makes ornamental business card holders how to use Facebook and Twitter."" So let's walk through the important elements. Was it a $5,000 grant? Yes. Was it just ""an employee"" who got $5,000 worth of training? No. And Stenhouse’s and Williams’ own report acknowledges that. Did the grant go for training to use Facebook and Twitter? Yes. But it was also spent on other forms of social media and involved a lot more than how to ""friend"" someone or keep a tweet below 140 characters. In addition, nearly 40 percent of the training time was spent on more-traditional sales training. Because the statement contains some elements of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

State Sen. Tom Garrett says Medicaid expansion money ""goes away"" in a few years
","State Sen. Thomas A. Garrett Jr. says Uncle Sam is doling disappearing dollars to entice states to expand their Medicaid programs. ""This money is guaranteed for a few years, and then goes away,"" Garrett, R-Louisa, wrote in an op-ed that ran earlier this month in The Free-Lance Star and the Richmond Times-Dispatch. We looked behind the curtains to see if the money really does vanish. Garrett’s claim comes as the General Assembly is locked in a largely partisan debate over expanding Medicaid eligibility to 400,000 additional low-income and disabled Virginians. The stalemate is blocking passage of a two-year state budget. The Democratic-controlled state Senate and Gov. Terry McAuliffe support expansion, saying it will help the needy and most of the cost will be borne by the federal government under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Garrett opposes broadening eligibility, echoing arguments from the Republican-led House that Medicaid already is fraught with waste and that Washington can not be trusted to keep its funding commitment. The expansion would make Medicaid available to people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line, or  about $16,104 in a one-person household and $21,707  in a two-person household. So far, 26 states and the District of Columbia have decided to participate. Virginia's average cutoff for adult eligibility is 32.7 percent of the federal poverty line, according to the state's Medicaid agency. That breaks down to annual earnings of about $3,846 for a one-person household and $5,144 for a two-person household. Virginia evenly split its Medicaid costs with the federal government. Obamacare calls for the federal government to pay the entire cost of expansion through 2016. The U.S. match drops to 95 percent  in 2017, 94  percent in 2018, 93 percent in 2019 and 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. Why does Garrett say ""the money is guaranteed for only a few years and then goes away?"" His legislative assistant, Paul Allen, said Garrett was referring to the drop in federal funding for expanded enrollment from 100 percent now to 90 percent in 2020.   ""While Tom said `it’s guaranteed for a few years, then goes away,’ he means guaranteed full funding with federal dollars,"" Allen emailed us. ""The burden then falls back on Virginia to make up those federal cuts."" Garrett did not make that distinction in two references to federal funding he made in his op-ed. In addition to the one we’ve discussed, Garrett wrote that  ""once the federal money is gone, two things happen: 1) Virginians will have to make up the shortfall and 2) those arguing for expansion will try increasing taxes, doubling down on a broken program."" We should note that if Virginia opts for expansion by July 1, it would receive $2.9 billion in additional federal Medicaid money over the next two fiscal years, according to the state's Medicaid agency. Our ruling Garrett wrote that the federal money that’s being offered for Medicaid expansion ""is guaranteed for a few years, then goes away."" His aide says that Garrett simply means the 100 percent federal match is only guaranteed for a few years. And sure, some money will go away as the U.S. match shrinks to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond under the Affordable Care Act. But Garrett does not make that distinction in his sweeping statement, which he repeats a second time in his column. He creates a misleading impression that Obamacare cuts off all money for Medicaid expansion after states opt to increase their enrollments.

Senate Dem group claims Koch brothers support tax breaks for outsourcing jobs
","As we’ve noted, Democrats are hellbent on bringing up the Koch brothers as often as possible during this election cycle. They’ve sought to criticize the billionaire brothers and conservative backers on a number of issues — even when the connection appears to be a stretch. Such is the case with an ad from the Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic outfit going toe-to-toe on the airwaves with the Koch-supported Americans for Prosperity in a handful of heavily contested Senate races, including Louisiana. ""Out-of-state billionaires spending millions to rig the system and elect (Louisiana Republican candidate for Senate) Bill Cassidy,"" a narrator says as a picture of David and Charles Koch appears on the screen. ""Their goal: Another politician bought and paid for. Their agenda: Protect tax cuts for companies that ship our jobs overseas. Cut Social Security and end Medicare as we know it. They even tried to kill relief for hurricane victims. Cassidy’s billion-dollar backers: They’ve got a plan for him. It’s not good for Louisiana."" This ad first came out about a month ago, and it has already earned Four Pinocchios from the Washington Post Fact Checker, the lowest rating on their scale. But given the recent focus on the Koch brothers and the staying power of Democratic attacks on them, we thought we should review the ad ourselves to see if we reached the same conclusion. We’re looking at the claim that the Koch brothers are protecting ""tax cuts for companies that ship our jobs overseas."" The Senate Majority PAC said this is in reference to a 2012 bill called the Bring Jobs Home Act. The measure had two key components. The first was to create a tax break for companies that chose to repatriate jobs, meaning bring them back to the United States from overseas. The second part was to bar companies from using a standard tax deduction for moving expenses if they were for work outsourced to other countries. The ad makes it seem like companies that move jobs overseas have a special tax preference carved out for them that grants privileges not awarded other companies. It’s actually a standard business expense deduction used for companies moving 10 blocks or 10,000 miles. The Senate bill would have put overseas moving expenses into a new category by eliminating their ability to claim this standard deduction. The merits of this policy can be debated. (For what it’s worth, the bill failed to pass the Senate. Twice.) But to imply this is a tax cut or special loophole for only businesses that move jobs overseas is misleading. Follow the money Regardless of what the bill does, let’s get to the other issue: Did the Koch brothers try to block it? We asked Senate Majority PAC for their evidence because none was presented in the ad. If what follows sounds like a game of Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, that’s because it kind of is. The source for the claim is a blog post written by Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group that advocates for a flat tax. When you think of Americans for Tax Reform, the first name that pops into mind is Grover Norquist, not the Koch brothers. Norquist for years has famously collected signatures from Republicans on a pledge not to raise taxes and he first started Americans for Tax Reform in 1985. It turns out Americans for Tax Reform receives some funding from an organization close to the Koch brothers, the Center to Protect Patient Rights. The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan watchdog of campaigns spending, described this organization as one of three ""dark money groups tied to the Kochs that did nothing but give out checks."" The Center to Protect Patient Rights has given Americans for Tax Reform about $4 million since 2010. Of that, $350,000 came in 2012, the year the Bring Jobs Home Act came up for a vote. The group reported about $30.9 million in contributions that year. While $4 million represents one of Americans for Tax Reform’s largest donations from a single benefactor, it pales in comparison to the amount of money the group has received from another conservative group, Crossroads GPS, an organization run by Republican strategist Karl Rove. Crossroads GPS gave Americans for Tax Reform $30 million since 2010, an overwhelming chunk of the group’s funding. Americans for Tax Reform has ""been around a long time and doesn't seem to be a central part of the Koch network,"" said Viveca Novak, a spokeswoman for the Center for Responsive Politics. ""That said, it has received millions in the last few years from a group that is a hub of that network, the Center to Protect Patient Rights."" Back to the blog post written by Americans for Tax Reform. The author was not speaking directly about the Bring Jobs Home Act, but rather was ""fact-checking"" President Barack Obama’s State of the Union speech, in which he said ""companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas."" The blog post said Obama’s claim wasn’t true. That blog passage coupled with Norquist’s anti-tax pledge is evidence enough that the group opposed the Bring Jobs Home Act, Senate Majority PAC said. But we think that’s pretty flimsy ground to stand on. We asked Americans for Tax Reform for their official stance on the Bring Jobs Home Act. A spokesman said they did not take one — a notable development since the organization vocalizes positions on dozens of bills each year and often grades lawmakers on how closely they align their votes with the organization. Americans for Prosperity, which is closely affiliated with the Koch brothers, also said they took no position on the legislation. ""We did nothing to try to oppose that bill,"" said Christopher Neefus, a spokesman for the organization. ""We favor lower, simpler corporate taxation without special treatment for favored interests — that would be much broader than what this bill set out to do."" Neefus said Americans for Prosperity in the past has supported tax incentives for companies to bring jobs back into the United States. Our ruling Senate Majority PAC claimed the Koch brothers sought to ""protect tax cuts for companies that ship our jobs overseas."" The ad is misleading in two ways. For starters, there are no carved-out tax cuts for companies that outsource work. There is a standard deduction companies can utilize when they move, but it can be used at home and abroad. Secondly, the organization pinned the Koch brothers’ opposition to a statement from Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group that has received only limited funding from the Koch network and never took an official position on the legislation. Americans for Prosperity, a group closer to the Koch brothers, also took no position. A note to ad makers: Supporting negative claims with flimsy evidence won’t win you points on the Truth-O-Meter.

Charlie Crist opposed in-state tuition for Dreamers in 2006, Republican Party of Florida says
","In a statewide election year when both parties are courting Florida’s growing Hispanic vote, the Legislature is debating giving in-state college tuition to young illegal immigrants known as ""Dreamers."" Similar efforts have failed in the past decade in Tallahassee. But this year the proposal may have the support of Gov. Rick Scott, who has said he will consider the bill if it also contains a provision he wants, one that is unrelated to immigrants: prohibiting universities from raising tuition above the rate set by the Florida Legislature. Democrats have portrayed Scott as anti-Hispanic after supporting an Arizona-style immigration law in 2010 and vetoing a bill that would have given Dreamers driver's licenses in 2013. Scott’s campaign also faced accusations by his former campaign finance chairman, Mike Fernandez, that some campaign staffers made fun of Mexican accents. In an April 9 press release, the Florida Democratic Party said the in-state tuition this year is election-year pandering. The Republican Party of Florida fired back in an email with their own attack against Charlie Crist, the Democratic frontrunner for governor: ""Yesterday, Florida Democrats said it was time to ‘do what is right’ for Florida’s Hispanic community, regarding legislation that is moving through the Senate giving in-state college tuition to children brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents,"" April 10 the state party stated. ""So where does the Florida Democratic Party’s own candidate stand on the issue? In 2006, Charlie Crist opposed in-state tuition for illegal immigrants."" We wanted to check Crist’s position on in-state tuition for illegal immigrants in 2006 -- and in the following years. First, a note about Hispanics, who represented about 14 percent of voters in Florida as of 2012. Hispanics lean Democratic but past results show their vote in the governor’s race could be competitive. Though President Barack Obama overwhelmingly won the state’s Hispanic vote in 2012, Hispanics narrowly backed Scott in 2010 according to exit polls, though there was a large margin of error. Dreamers bill in 2006 The state party email cited a 2006 Miami Herald article about Crist when he was attorney general. According to the story, Crist said state lawmakers ""did the ‘right thing’ earlier this year when they rejected a bill allowing children of illegal immigrants to pay the same tuition rates as Florida residents."" That year a proposal to give certain Florida residents who were illegal immigrants in-state tuition divided Republican legislators and drew opposition from Senate President Tom Lee. Ultimately, the proposal failed. (Then-Gov. Jeb Bush said he supported giving in-state tuition to those children if they had lived in Florida at least two years, but he also said it wasn’t the year to deal with it, so the controversial provision was removed from an education bill.) A spokeswoman for the Republican Party of Florida didn’t point to any additional statements by Crist. We went in search of other statements by Crist about giving in-state tuition to children of illegal immigrants and found little else. It did not appear that any bills that would grant in-state tuition to Dreamers reached Crist’s desk while he was governor during sessions between 2007 and 2010. An August 2006 article in the Tampa Bay Times included a one-word ""yes"" or ""no"" answer from candidates for governor to several questions, including this one: ""Should we allow the children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at our universities?"" The answer for Crist: No. Dreamers bill in 2014 Now running as a Democrat, Crist supports in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. ""We must immediately pass legislation that allows the children of undocumented parents to attend Florida colleges and universities at in-state tuition levels,"" Crist says on the immigration page of his campaign website. ""It simply isn’t fair to punish children of undocumented parents."" This year’s bill has the backing of House Speaker Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, and passed the House 81-33 in March. In the Senate, a similar measure passed in committees but hasn’t received a vote by the full Senate yet. The bill has the support of many public universities in Florida, and other Republican governors have signed similar measures, including Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. A footnote about Scott and the Dreamers bill this year: Scott has expressed support for the Senate version of the bill which includes getting rid of the tuition differential that allows universities to raise rates beyond what the Legislature sets. The House version doesn’t include that provision. When asked about the House bill April 1, Scott reaffirmed his support for the Senate version. ""I'm going to work with the Senate and the House to make sure we have a bill that lowers tuition for all Floridians,"" he said. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said in an email, ""In 2006, Charlie Crist opposed in-state tuition for illegal immigrants."" The attack doesn’t mention the fact that Crist now supports in-state tuition for immigrants here illegally. But the statement about 2006 is correct: We found two newspaper articles that stated Crist, who was running as a Republican for governor, opposed in-state tuition for Dreamers.

Freedom Partners ad accuses Rep. Bruce Braley of giving 'special favors' to insurers by voting for Obamacare
","A new ad by Freedom Partners -- a group that has served as a hub for funding by billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch -- recently began airing ads against Democratic Senate candidates, targeting them for their support of President Barack Obama’s health care law. The group had been little known until the Washington Post reported in January that Freedom Partners had ""raised $256 million from unknown sources, money that was then transferred to a complex network of LLCs and political nonprofits that do not disclose their donors."" By airing the new ads against Democratic Senate candidates, it appears that Freedom Partners is ""bringing in-house many of the functions it financed through other groups in the last campaign,"" the Post reported. One of the Freedom Partners ads attacks Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, who’s running to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin. Braley will face one of several potential Republican candidates in a general election that independent observers consider competitive. Here’s the full narration of the ad: ""No one likes it when politicians give special favors. Congressman Bruce Braley voted for Obamacare. The government spent millions of taxpayer dollars to promote it. Now, health insurance companies stand to make billions. And Bruce Braley? He takes tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industry. For Iowans, it's canceled policies and higher costs. That's not right. Call Bruce Braley. Tell him: Stand with Iowa. Stop supporting Obamacare."" There’s a lot to chew on here, but we decided to narrow our focus to the claim that Braley took ""tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industry"" and gave them ""special favors"" by voting for Obamacare. Did Braley take ""tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industry""? This claim reminded us of the scene from Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery in which Dr. Evil (Mike Meyers) threatens to unleash some horrible threat upon the earth unless he is paid -- pausing for dramatic effect -- ""one million dollars."" His nonplussed advisers gently suggest that he raise the ransom amount, since in today’s dollars, $1 million isn’t really all that much. In Braley’s case, yes -- he took ""tens of thousands"" from the insurance industry. But saying that misses a whole bunch of important context. Braley has accepted a total of $83,500 from individuals and PACs connected to the insurance industry since his first campaign for the House in the 2006 campaign cycle, according to data gleaned from the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent collector of campaign finance information. That includes $24,250 so far during the 2014 campaign cycle. In isolation, this may sound like a lot. But here’s the context. First, this is money from the ""insurance"" sector, not necessarily the health insurance sector. Once you strip out car insurance companies, homeowner insurance companies, life insurance companies and the like, the amount is much less. We asked the Center for Responsive Politics to do the stripping for us. Here are the results: Over the last decade, Braley has received a total of $16,000 from health insurance political action committees: $8,500 from Humana, $3,000 from Delta Dental, $2,500 from VSP Holdings and $2,000 from AFLAC. He received an additional $4,500 from eight individual donors employed by a health insurance company, all but one donation smaller than $750. Altogether, this is $20,500 from health insurance sources -- less than a quarter of his take from insurers more generally, and about $2,000 for every year he’s served in Congress. ""This is not a lot of money to influence a huge vote like that,"" said Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. If we are going to compare Braley to other Senate candidates on an apples-to-apples basis, it’s only feasible to use the the Center for Responsive Politics’ standard data for ""insurance"" companies. So how does Braley’s insurance haul compare to that other lawmakers? Not very impressively. Among all Senate candidates running in 2014, Braley ranks 55th. Since there are just 36 Senate races this year, some of which feature minimal opposition to incumbents, that’s pretty low indeed for a sitting House member in a competitive seat to rank 55th. And how big a share of Braley’s warchest comes from this broader swath of the insurance industry? Not very big. The insurance industry ranks 19th on the list of biggest sector donors to Braley’s campaigns over his entire career. For the 2014 cycle, insurance ranks 16th among all sectors donating to Braley. In all, insurance donations account for less than 1 percent of all the cash Braley has raised during his political career. (The industry that ranks No. 1 -- giving $4,084,645 over the course of Braley’s career -- is ""lawyers and law firms."" This connection recently caused a major embarrassment for Braley when he was caught on videotape jabbing Sen. Chuck Grassley, the popular Republican he’s seeking to join in the Senate, as ""a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school."" Slate’s John Dickerson joked that Braley’s farm-state gaffe was so massive ""that the Environmental Protection Agency may seek to regulate it."") Was it a special favor to the health insurance industry to vote for Obamacare? For one thing, it’s not as simple as the ad says -- the insurance industry hardly loves every aspect of the law, so it’s not clear that voting for it was an undiluted gift for the industry. ""In particular, the medical loss ratio that limits their profits and requires 80 cents on each dollar be spent on insurance recipients keeps their profits from soaring,"" Ornstein said. In addition, it strains logic to think that Braley would have turned from an opponent of the law, or even agnostic about it, to a supporter of it simply because of the desires of donors who collectively gave him a fraction of one percent of his total campaign warchest. It’s not as if Braley had built his political career on being a foe of a health care overhaul. Like most Democrats, he supported policies to lower the number of uninsured Americans. During his first campaign for the House in 2006, ""Braley called for expanding health care for the uninsured,"" according to the 2008 edition of the Almanac of American Politics. And in September 2009, when the House health care bill was on its way to the floor, the Des Moines Register reported that Braley said that the often divisive town meetings about health care had only stiffened his resolve. ""You've been out there talking about your values for health care reform and, for some of us, it's made us more dedicated than ever to doing something meaningful about health care reform,"" Braley said, according to the newspaper. Combined, Braley’s past promises and pressure from his party are likely to have outweighed any campaign donations from the industry, Ornstein said. The partisan pressure to toe the line on the health care bill was especially strong because it was the No. 1 legislative priority of a president from his own party, and the vote would be decided essentially along party lines. ""Political science scholars have spilled much ink and used countless hours of computer time linking these kinds of ordinary contributions to voting outcomes, and have come up with very little,"" said Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist. A final point: If the ad considers donations from the insurance industry to be the linchpin of a politician’s support for Obamacare, how can this explain the overall pattern of donations by the insurance industry? As it turns out, nine of the 13 Senate candidates who received the most money from the insurance industry in 2014 are Republicans, a list headed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who received $231,800. Yet despite the backing of the industry, none of these Republicans voted for Obamacare. And what about Braley’s fellow Iowan, Grassley? Grassley -- who did not vote for Obamacare -- has received $318,202 from the insurance industry in the 2014 cycle, or about 13 times as much as Braley did over the same period. And the insurance industry’s ranking among the industries donating to Grassley? It ranks first. Freedom Partners’ argument A spokesman for Freedom Partners, James Davis, said just looking at the size of the donations misses the point. ""What's important to understand is that our ad isn't just about dollar amounts, it's about hypocrisy,"" Davis said. He pointed to an ad by the pro-Braley independent group Senate Majority PAC that said Braley wants to ""hold insurance companies accountable"" and ""knows we can’t go back to letting insurance companies deny coverage for pre-existing conditions and kick people off their coverage when they get sick."" (Both were policies outlawed by passage of Obamacare, and which would be at risk of re-emerging after an Obamacare repeal unless specifically protected.) ""The point we're making is: How can Rep. Braley claim he's standing up to health insurance companies, while at the same time taking their campaign donations and supporting Obamacare – a huge boon to the health insurance industry?"" Davis said. ""It's not about where he falls in the line of donations – it's about saying one thing and doing another."" However, we don’t think the use of the phrase ""special favors"" and ""friends in the health insurance industry"" suggests hypocrisy. Rather, it all but suggests that Braley is corrupt, pursuing damaging policies because he gains personally from interested parties. And on that score, the evidence is thin indeed. We asked Freedom Partners if they had any evidence of favors Braley had done for specific companies, but the group did not reply. Our ruling Freedom Partners’ ad claims that Braley took ""tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industry"" and gave them ""special favors"" by voting for Obamacare. Braley did take tens of thousands of dollars from the insurance industry, though from all types of insurers, not just health insurers. However, Braley, like most Democrats, had campaigned on expanding health coverage to the uninsured, and then, faced with a landmark and highly partisan vote, carried through on his stated intentions. It’s ridiculous to suggest that donors who contributed less than 1 percent of his warchest weighed more heavily on his vote than his ideology, his past campaign promises and his partisan affiliation.

Deal takes credit for restoring pre-k cuts
","In his re-election bid, Gov. Nathan Deal is taking credit for restoring Georgia’s nationally lauded and lottery-funded pre-kindergarten program to its traditional 180 days a year. He’s billing himself as the candidate in the race who is the ""real Deal"" and promoting that change to pre-k on his campaign website as one of the ""real results"" of his administration. And why wouldn’t he? Every year, thousands of Georgia parents who might otherwise be paying for child care are sending their 4-year-olds to free pre-k in 3,800 classes, statewide. About 82,000 children are currently enrolled in Georgia pre-k, and about 6,000 more are on waiting lists. Arguably, only the lottery-funded HOPE college scholarship program is more popular.  But can the governor take credit for pre-k being back on track this school year with a traditional 180-day calendar? We decided a deeper look was needed.  Deal, a Republican and former congressman, became Georgia’s governor in January 2011 and quickly took on a subject that lawmakers had been discussing but largely sidestepping: With revenue from lottery tickets falling and program expenses rising, could HOPE and pre-k survive for the long term?  By 2010, the combined annual expenditures for pre-k and HOPE had started to exceed annual lottery revenue dedicated to the two programs. The Lottery Reserve Fund, which had reached a peak balance of nearly $1 billion, had been tapped to fund deficits generated by HOPE. By 2011, the reserve fund’s balance was under $600 million, according to a 2012 report by the nonprofit, liberal-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. Deal proposed major changes, including converting pre-k from a full-day to a part-day program, but he abandoned that proposal after a public outcry. As an alternative, he asked lawmakers to reduce the pre-k school year from 180 to 160 days, for a savings estimated at $22 million a year. The governor also recommended cutting more than 300 pre-k classes across the state, forcing some teachers out of jobs and requiring the teachers that remained to take on extra students. Lawmakers went along with the governor’s recommendations, which, according to the Budget and Policy Institute, reduced lottery funding for pre-k by about $54 million, to $355 million in fiscal 2012. Teachers who stayed received smaller paychecks, and many of them bolted for jobs in kindergarten, first grade and elsewhere within a year. Deal subsequently recommended -- and lawmakers approved -- restoring 10 days to the 2012-2013 pre-k school year and returning to the traditional 180-day school year for the current school year, which started in August. The larger class sizes, resulting in an estimated $30 million annual savings, remain. Jennifer Talaber, a spokeswoman for Deal’s re-election campaign, said the governor can rightly claim credit. ""Governor Deal's reforms stabilized our lottery-funded programs, which were on the brink of bankruptcy,"" she said. ""Those tough changes -- and the strong leadership it took to achieve them -- are why we can afford 180 days now."" We asked Talaber to share with us any data that the governor had when he made the decision to recommend cutting the program days, as well as when he recommended restoring them. She referred us to previous reports in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Brian Robinson, the governor’s spokesman, told the newspaper in 2012 that the governor was able to push to restore the pre-k days because the cuts made in 2011 stabilized the program and ""yielded more savings than anticipated."" Steve Barnett, the director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University, said the shortening of the pre-k year did ""damage from which there may not be immediate recovery."" ""Teachers may view these jobs as less secure, and this lowers the quality of teacher that can be attracted,"" Barnett said. But, he said, ""restoring the program is a very good thing to have done. If there were hard choices that had to be made to make that happen, then there is some credit for that."" As for the long-term financial prospects for pre-k and HOPE -- both considered education game-changers for Georgia -- there’s not much talk about that these days. Lottery revenue dedicated to education has grown since it plunged 4 percent, or $39 million, in 2011. It was up 7 percent in 2012 and 3 percent in 2013, according to the Georgia Lottery Corp. And the reserve fund had $734 million as of June 30, 2013, records show. Our conclusion: Gov. Nathan Deal was the driving force behind the push to reinstate the days to Georgia pre-k. But he also initiated the cuts, and they had consequences, including the loss of experienced teachers. Those are important details that Deal doesn’t mention when he states that restoring pre-k to 180 days was one of the ""real results"" of his term as governor. Therefore, we rate his statement as Half True.  ",/factchecks/2014/apr/11/nathan-deal/deal-takes-credit-restoring-pre-k-cuts/

Would eliminating the pay gap in Oregon let women buy 2,877 gallons of gas, 72 weeks of food or nearly 12 months of rent?
","The economic equity issues that proved pivotal in the 2012 presidential campaign are again shaping up as big factors this year. Both major parties are pushing to make sure their talking points prevail. Democrats cite statistics showing a yawning pay gap between men and women, with Republicans countering that young women are out earning men in some urban areas. The Claim The National Partnership For Women & Families, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group, released a new analysis April 8, 2014, to coincide with Equal Pay Day. It cited U.S. Census data showing that women who work full time in Oregon are paid 79 cents for every dollar paid to men -- a claim PolitiFact Oregon has investigated previously and found solid. But it went further. If the wage gap were eliminated, it said, ""a working woman in Oregon would have enough money per year for 2,877 gallons of gas, 72 more weeks of food for her family or nearly 12 more months of rent. We wondered if the specific pieces of the claim were on the money. The Analysis The basis of the group’s claim comes from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. It lists, state by state, median annual earnings for year-round, full-time workers and draws on statistics from 2012, the most recent year available. Men in Oregon earned $47,402, compared with $37,381 for women, according to the data. That’s 79 cents on the dollar and adds up to a gap of $10,021 a year. The gap persists for a variety of reasons, said Mary King, a Portland State University economics professor, including a gender division of labor under which ""women’s jobs"" are paid less, lack of strong family-leave policies, and women disproportionately ending up in low-paying retail and service work. Satisfied that women do earn 79 cents for every dollar earned by men -- the gap would be 21 cents -- we emailed Sadie Kliner, the National Partnership for Women & Families’ communications director. She directed us to a separate fact sheet. Gasoline prices, according to the sheet, were provided by Oil Price Information Service in cooperation with Wex, Inc. A gallon of regular gas in Oregon currently costs $3.697, it read. We checked that against AAA Oregon/Idaho’s website, which shows regular gas in Oregon right now averaging $3.69 per gallon. Then we did the math, dividing the wage gap of $10,021 by $3.69. The group claimed a woman could buy 2,877 gallons, but we found closing the gap would enable a woman to buy only 2,715 gallons. We contacted Kliner again, who noted that Oregon’s gas prices were $3.48 when the fact sheet was prepared in early March. A check of AAA’s gas-price information confirmed Kliner’s point. We moved on to the 12 months worth of rent piece of the claim. The group, citing data from the Census’s 2012 American Community Survey, put the median cost for rental housing in Oregon at $862 a month. It showed a margin of error of plus or minus 8 percent. Independently verifying that number wasn’t easy, since no county or or state organization tracks it. We called Multifamily NW, whose members manage more than 150,000 rental units from southern Washington to Medford. Jonathan Clay, the association’s research and communications analyst, pointed us to a semi-annual survey released in October. Two-bedroom, one-bath units averaged $818 per month across the metro area, according to the survey, putting it within range of the margin of error in the Census data. We calculated that $10,021 would pay for 11.5 months of rent, just over half a month shy of the group’s original claim of 12 months. Again contacting Kliner about the discrepancy, she noted that the group rounded the figure up, using the word ""nearly"" to account for the difference. Finally, in assessing food costs, we noted that the original claim said ""72 more weeks of food for her family."" While the claim didn’t specify the number of children, we settled on two. We then checked the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website, which publishes monthly food plans representing a well-rounded diet at four different cost levels. Drawing from the low-cost plan, two children could be fed on $97.50 per week. Food costs for an adult female would bring the family’s weekly total to $144.90. That compares with the $139.10 per week for the 72 weeks in the group’s pay-gap claim. Our Ruling A national advocacy group, in spotlighting Equal Pay Day, claimed that a pay gap between men and women exists in Oregon. PolitiFact Oregon has looked at the gap before and found that it’s real, but we took the next step by fact-checking the group’s claim that the gap is big enough to pay for 2,877 gallons of gasoline, 72 months of food or nearly 12 months of rent. All three elements of the claim checked out -- or were very close -- according to independent sources. We rate the claim True.",/factchecks/2014/apr/10/national-partnership-women-families/would-eliminating-pay-gap-oregon-let-women-buy-287/

Facebook post says Michele Bachmann said 'we have zero proof' Obama is not behind Fort Hood shootings
","U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., is clearly no fan of President Barack Obama. In recent weeks, like most weeks, she skewered his administration’s handling of the Benghazi attack, the IRS scrutiny of tea party groups and the health care law. A Facebook meme suggests she also took to the airwaves to sort of blame Obama for the shootings by an Iraq War veteran at Fort Hood, Texas, that resulted in four deaths and 16 injuries. ""I’m not saying Obama is responsible for the Fort Wood (sic) shooting. I’m just saying that we have zero proof that he isn’t,"" Bachmann is quoted as saying on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show April 2, 2014. A reader asked us if this post, which he said he saw on Facebook, is real. It’s not. The first clue that something is fishy: The post refers to Fort Wood, not Fort Hood. The second: The screenshot that serves as the backdrop for the quote is from Bachmann’s June 2013 interview on Fox News’ Hannity when she discussed her decision to leave Congress at the end of her term in January. Bachmann was not on Hannity’s show on April 2, 2014, the date attributed to the quote. She did appear on The O’Reilly Factor on April 3, but it was to talk about her questioning of a former CIA official over the Benghazi attacks. She didn’t say the quote in question there either. A Lexis Nexis review of recent transcripts shows she has not commented about the attacks on the army base beyond this tweet saying she was praying for the Fort Hood community. ""Congresswoman Bachmann never said that quote, and didn’t even appear on Hannity that day. It’s 100 percent fake,"" said her spokesman Dan Kotman. He pointed out that the same Facebook group where this meme was shared, the satirical Christians for Michele Bachmann, was also behind a widely shared and debunked post alleging Bachmann said Jesus wrote the Bible in English. Bachmann may not blame Obama for the shooting, but conservative blog Gateway Pundit did, writing, ""The Obama administration is responsible for this mass shooting. They witnessed this before. They didn’t learn a thing. Gun free zones are death zones."" The post was referenced by hosts of Fox & Friends on April 3. But that wasn’t Bachmann. We can’t find a trace of her saying, ""I’m not saying Obama is responsible for the Fort Wood shooting. I’m just saying that we have zero proof that he isn’t."" And she wasn’t on Hannity on the night the posts says she was. The post appears to be satire, but not everyone has taken it that way -- all you have to do is read the comments on the original photo.

John Sununu says just 1.4 million Americans insured for first time under Obamacare at $2 trillion cost
","For all the cheers of ""we did it!"" last week about 7.1 million Obamacare sign-ups, former U.S. Sen. John E. Sununu says Democrats are glossing over one big, grim fact. They’re barely making a dent in delivering health insurance to the uninsured. Sununu, a New Hampshire Republican who writes columns for the Boston Globe, made his case for this theory during the April 6 political roundtable on NBC’s Meet the Press. (Don’t worry about following his math for right now, we’ll explain it.) ""It’s not about enrollment figures. It’s about reducing the number of uninsured in this country,"" Sununu said. ""We have 50 million uninsured. If you only look at the enrollment figure, you miss the question of how many of them were previously uninsured."" ""So you have to multiply it by about 80 percent, Rand says 80 percent probably will be the number that actually pay. Gets you down to 5.6 (million). And how many who were previously uninsured, McKinsey consulting did some surveys, 25 percent previously uninsured. Now you're down to 1.4 million. That’s about 3 percent,"" Sununu said. ""Reducing the number of uninsured in America by 3 percent for how much money? $2 trillion. That’s not good cost-spending,"" PunditFact is focusing on Sununu’s conclusion: Obamacare reduces the uninsured population by just 3 percent at a cost of $2 trillion. The claim, we find, is a far cry from reality for three reasons: Just about every piece of the math Sununu laid out is based on shaky or debatable assumptions. This produces the even shakier result that only 1.4 million people were not previously uninsured before getting coverage under the health care law, or 3 percent of the previously uninsured population. The $2 trillion cost he mentions is a 10-year projection for government spending, which does not factor in revenue brought in from the law and is inappropriately juxtaposed with his estimate for the first year of Obamacare signups. The online marketplaces operated by federal and state governments were never meant to be the only way people obtain insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Various reports show millions pursued coverage through their employers and Medicaid over the six-month enrollment period. Let’s dive in. Mangling the math This is not Sununu’s first stab at trying to dissect the government’s reported figures in an effort to pinpoint who’s really gaining insurance for the first time. He wrote a Boston Globe column on the topic before we got the final number from the feds. The real size and insurance history of the Obamacare enrollment pool is not yet disclosed by the federal government. While important, size alone won’t make or break the exchanges as much as including a good mix of healthy, low-risk enrollees. ""50 million uninsured Americans"" -- Sununu claims there are 50 million people uninsured in America. Analysts at the numbers-crunching Rand Corporation say there are 40 million uninsured nonelderly adults. The Census Bureau put the population at 48 million in 2012. A Congressional Budget Office estimate put it at 55 million in 2013 and 44 million in 2014. Sununu’s figure isn’t indefensible, but it’s clearly just an estimate. And making estimations with estimates doesn’t usually produce good math. ""Rand says 80 percent will be the number that actually pay"" -- The Rand Corporation says the number doesn’t come from them. Sununu, whom we could not reach for comment, may have mixed up a report by McKinsey and Company, a large private consulting group, when he used a multiplier of 80 percent to get who has actually paid for a plan from the Obamacare marketplaces. In his Globe column, he mentioned a similar figure by Goldman Sachs. That’s not out of left field, though it’s on the lower end of what we’ve heard. Health and Human Services secretary Kathleen Sebelius has described the premium payment rate reported by insurers to be between 80 and 90 percent of sign-ups, and Blue Cross Blue Shield Associates, one of the largest insurers in the country, has said 80 to 85 percent of people have paid the first month’s premium for plans obtained through exchanges. McKinsey found 77 percent of respondents who obtained new insurance for 2014 through February paid their premium with those who had been previously insured more likely to pay than those who were not. Some argue a 20 percent drop-off rate is too high, as some people have been unable to pay their premiums and others do not have to pay them until late April. Still, ""The percent who paid for coverage issue is a valid concern,"" said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University law professor who supports the law. ""25 percent previously uninsured"" -- Once Sununu whittles down who he thinks will actually pay, Sununu tries to get to the bottom of who was previously uninsured. He holds up an oft-reported figure from the McKinsey and Company report. The McKinsey study actually found a previously uninsured rate of 27 percent among people surveyed in February who said they switched to a new plan or were previously not enrolled, up from 11 percent in the company’s previous surveys. It’s important to note, as we did in another fact-check, the McKinsey report focused on the individual insurance market as a whole, not just the federal and state marketplaces. People are still free to buy insurance for themselves through private companies. Point being, the McKinsey survey doesn’t really tell us much about who’s buying covering through the health insurance marketplaces because it did not distinguish between those who bought through the exchanges from those who bought through other means. A Rand survey that debuted a couple days after Sununu’s comments put the previously uninsured rate at about 36 percent of new marketplace enrollees. The Rand survey did not account for people who signed up for insurance in the final days of March. And what about $2 trillion spending? Now to address the $2 trillion question in the room. Sununu is referring to the gross costs of the insurance provisions in the health care law. Gross costs from 2014-24 amount to a little more than $2 trillion, according to projections in a February 2014 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation, two respected agencies that analyze the effects of legislation (Page 106). Focusing on the gross amount leaves out the $517 billion the government expects to take in through tax penalties from people who do not have insurance and certain employers who do not offer it, as well as tax revenues. The net cost over the period is $1.487 trillion from 2015-24, or $1.528 trillion if you include the net spending in 2014 primarily on subsidies and Medicaid. Even though Sununu is referencing a figure for spending, he misrepresents the 10-year spending by comparing it to one marketplace enrollment period for 2014. As Gail Wilensky, director of Medicaid and Medicare under President George H. W. Bush, said, ""This is a numerical ‘no-no.’"" Oh, don’t forget these budget-crunchers also found the total effect of the Affordable Care Act is to reduce federal deficits. Wrapping up Sununu’s math Using Sununu’s numbers the same way he did, he finds 1.42 million previously uninsured people are purchasing health insurance, or 2.84 percent of the uninsured population. If we used other available estimates, we could conclude the health care law is providing coverage to 5.75 percent of the uninsured population. We’re not saying you should conclude that; we’re just showing how much things could change by selecting one estimate over another. Marketplace just a piece of the insurance puzzle Still, there is a broader issue with Sununu’s point that is even more important than the math he presents. He’s holding up the online marketplace sign-ups as the only solution in the Affordable Care Act for insuring more Americans. That’s not how the law is designed. It aims to cover more of the country’s uninsured population through a variety of insurance programs, not just the online marketplaces that allow customers to choose from an array of private plans. Other avenues including getting more low-income residents on Medicaid rolls, allowing young people to stay on their parents’ insurance, and expanding employer-sponsored health insurance, the method by which most people obtain coverage. ""To look only at the exchanges is not giving you the full picture,"" said Christine Eibner, a senior economist at Rand Corporation. Eibner co-authored an April 8 Rand report that found 9.3 million Americans gained health insurance from September 2013, which preceded the most recent open enrollment period, and mid March 2014, the last month of that period. The Rand numbers are estimates based on surveys of a 2,425-person sample and were published after Sununu’s comments on TV (so we won’t take off for what he didn’t know). That’s a net number accounting for 14.5 million people who gained insurance and 5.2 million who lost it. It is not unusual or new for people to lose insurance, Eibner points out, with reasons depending on changes to employment, marital status or policy cancellations. The Rand study offers an interesting glimpse of trends for the whole health insurance market -- not just the online marketplaces. Notably, most of the insurance gains were in employment-sponsored insurance (8.2 million) and Medicaid enrollment (5.9 million).  The report found federal and state marketplace sign-ups of 3.9 million, though this does not factor in people who signed up in the final days of enrollment in late March. Rand isn’t the only group with evidence more people are getting insurance. It mirrors findings released a day earlier by the pollster Gallup. Gallup found the uninsured rate among adult Americans fell to 15.6 percent in the first quarter of 2014, hitting its lowest level since before the recession in late 2008 and a big drop from 18 percent in mid 2013. A report by the Health Policy Center of the Urban Institute also suggests health insurance gains because of the law. The institute found the number of uninsured Americans fell from 17.9 percent to 15.2 percent, or by 5.4 million people, over the six-month open enrollment period, though it did not include the late March surge. Bigger gains came in states that chose to expand Medicaid. ""The one thing not to lose sight of clearly indicates that people are gaining coverage,"" said Stephen Zuckerman, an Urban Institute health economist. ""The exact magnitude, the exact type of coverage, those are measurement issues. There’s no evidence that people on net have lost coverage, and it’s very clear from a statistical standpoint, from a quantitative standpoint, that people are gaining coverage."" CBO, for the record, projected the law would reduce the number of uninsured nonelderly Americans by a net of 13 million uninsured people in 2014 and 25 million by 2016. And yet, there will still be millions of uninsured Americans when the law is fully implemented, experts say. CBO estimates that by 2019, 27 million people will have signed up on the marketplaces. There will still be roughly 31 million nonelderly residents who will be uninsured by 2024 due to undocumented immigrants who are ineligible for Medicaid and subsidies, would-be Medicaid enrollees who do not sign up or live in a state that did not expand coverage, and others who just don’t want it even though it is available. Our ruling Sununu used an imperfect methodology to arrive at his conclusion that Obamacare reduces ""the number of uninsured in America by 3 percent for how much money? $2 trillion."" He’s playing with numbers that aren’t fully known. What’s more, this pronouncement ignores two big places people are finding health insurance: through employers and the expansion of Medicaid in many states. The real focus of the health care law wasn’t just on enrolling people in the exchanges. It aimed to foster enrollment through many avenues of the health insurance market. We rate his statement False. Correction: A Rand survey put the previously uninsured rate at about 36 percent of new marketplace enrollees. An earlier version of this story described the percentage as the ""insured rate.""",/factchecks/2014/apr/10/john-e-sununu/john-sununu-says-just-14-million-americans-insured/

Fake news: military raided Obama's compound in Thailand with Trump's permission
","A fake news story said that President Donald Trump greenlit a pre-dawn raid on a mansion and compound owned by former President Barack Obama in Thailand. ""Delta Force raids Obama stronghold in Thailand,"" said a Dec. 27 headline on the website Someonesbones.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The photo of the alleged Obama compound in Thailand is actually a resort, and a Pentagon spokesman told PolitiFact that the story was false. Someonesbones describes itself as ""primarily dedicated to exploring the Nibiru realities and exposing scientific and govermental corruption."" (Yes, the website can’t spell ""government"" and says that the government and mainstream media are liars.) The story by Someonesbones has no actual evidence and quotes an anonymous source who said that Obama owns real estate and shadow companies across the globe. The story said that Obama, by proxy through the Solyndra Corporation, owned a mansion and a 400-acre estate in Thailand. Solyndra was a solar company that received money as part of the stimulus package. The U.S. Department of Energy invited Solyndra to apply for money in 2006 before Obama took office. The collapse of Solyndra in 2011 became political fodder leading up to the 2012 election. In Someonesbones’ made-up raid, Delta Force seized several encrypted laptops and over 200 million dollars in gold bullion, in addition to dozens of crates containing Chinese-manufactured firearms and explosives. (The only truthful part of that is Delta Force is an actual elite counter-terrorism unit.) Another sign that this is fake news: the story identified the prime minister of Thailand as Nik Bukharin while the actual prime minister is Prayuth Chan-ocha. (Nikolay Ivanovich Bukharin was a Soviet political leader who died in 1938.) The story had green and black images of what appeared to be military officers in night vision goggles. We searched the photos on Google images and one appeared to be similar to an image used in a 2013 story about the movie Zero Dark Thirty, which was about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden. The photo of the fictitious Obama compound in Thailand is actually Villa Rak Tawan, a luxurious estate in Phuket used for vacations and weddings. Someonesbones.com said ""Delta Force raids Obama stronghold in Thailand"" but we found no evidence that such a raid occurred.

How accurate is Donald Trump about black, Hispanic unemployment?
","President Donald Trump and his team found several positives to tout from the newest round of employment numbers. On Jan. 5, the day the new numbers were released, presidential daughter and White House official Ivanka Trump tweeted, ""The unemployment rate for African Americans fell to 6.8 percent, the lowest ever recorded. We are working hard to bring this rate down even further."" The unemployment rate for African Americans fell to 6.8 percent, the lowest ever recorded. We are working hard to bring this rate down even further. @WhiteHouseCEA https://t.co/LyNYIQ4D8s The president himself echoed the talking point in his own tweet Jan. 8: ""African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in our country. The Hispanic unemployment rate dropped a full point in the last year and is close to the lowest in recorded history. Dems did nothing for you but get your vote!  #NeverForget  @foxandfriends."" African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in our country. The Hispanic unemployment rate dropped a full point in the last year and is close to the lowest in recorded history. Dems did nothing for you but get your vote! #NeverForget @foxandfriends How accurate is the president’s tweet? He’s right on the numbers but leaves out economic gains for those groups under Democratic control.  Unemployment rates In December 2017, African-American unemployment fell to 6.8 percent. That’s a record low since the statistic was first calculated in 1972. The previous record low was 7 percent in April 2000 and September 2017. The Hispanic unemployment also dropped by a full percentage point, from 5.9 percent in December 2016 to 4.9 percent in December 2017. As the president said, this is close to the data point’s all-time low, which was 4.8 percent in October and November 2017. Did Democrats do ""nothing"" for black and Hispanic unemployment? The tweet would have been accurate if Trump had stopped after the numbers. But his dig on the Democrats marred his talking point. The unemployment rate for both groups declined dramatically on President Barack Obama’s watch. Black unemployment peaked at 16.6 percent in April 2010, when Obama was president. It then fell by more than half to 7.8 percent by the time Obama left office in January 2017. Hispanic unemployment, meanwhile, peaked at 13 percent in August 2009, then fell to 5.9 percent at the end of Obama’s term in January 2017 -- also a drop of more than half. We should note that presidents don’t deserve either full credit or full blame for the unemployment rate on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters; broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles. The White House did not reply to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Trump tweeted, ""African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in our country. The Hispanic unemployment rate dropped a full point in the last year and is close to the lowest in recorded history. Dems did nothing for you but get your vote!"" He’s right about the low unemployment rates for both blacks and Hispanics today. But his slam that the Democrats ""did nothing"" in this regard is an exaggeration.

Did Fire and Fury author Michael Wolff have access to the White House?
","The Trump administration has scrambled to control damaging headlines based on Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which was rushed to shelves Jan. 5 over threats from President Donald Trump’s attorneys. For his part, Trump sought to undermine Wolff’s credibility by calling into question the author’s access to the administration’s highest levels. ""I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book!"" Trump tweeted Jan. 4. ""I never spoke to him for book.""  I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist. Look at this guy’s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve! We decided to dissect Trump’s tweet by sifting through what’s known about Wolff’s White House access. We can’t know everything that goes on behind the scenes, but even the public record shows that Trump’s statement is inaccurate. Trump’s tweet could give the impression that Wolff was denied access to the White House entirely. But as Trump’s own press secretary has acknowledged, the author had more than a dozen interactions with administration officials at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Wolff claims that over an 18-month period, he conducted more than 200 interviews with Trump and senior staff. In the course of reporting his book, Wolff said he was able to take up ""something like a semi-permanent seat on a couch in the West Wing."" Trump never explicitly allowed his visits nor barred him from the White House, Wolff said, which allowed Wolff to exploit this ""non-disapproval"" to gain access through ""various senior staffers."" Here’s the author’s account of his access, as written in the Hollywood Reporter (the circumstances of which we could not independently verify): ""Since the new White House was often uncertain about what the president meant or did not mean in any given utterance, his non-disapproval became a kind of passport for me to hang around — checking in each week at the Hay-Adams hotel, making appointments with various senior staffers who put my name in the ‘system,’ and then wandering across the street to the White House and plunking myself down, day after day, on a West Wing couch."" As excerpts of Wolff’s book began to circulate, journalists were eager to have the White House weigh in on the incendiary headlines. During a White House press briefing, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders faced questions about Wolff’s access from one journalist who recalled seeing Wolff in the building multiple times. Here’s their Jan. 3 exchange: Margaret Brennan, CBS News: ""Sarah, can you clarify? Because many of us here have seen Michael Wolff at the White House on multiple occasions. We’ve seen him first-hand. So we know he was here. Who gave him access to the White House? What was he here for? Can you explain any of that since we don’t have access to the logs?"" Sanders: ""Yeah. So far, from what I can tell of the roughly just over a dozen interactions that he had with officials at the White House, I think close to 95 percent were all done so at the request of (former adviser) Mr. (Steve) Bannon."" Sanders underscored that Wolff had not been given unfettered access to the White House, saying he had been denied more than 30 requests for access, including at least two dozen requests to interview the president.   However, she did not dispute that Wolff had been ""seen often"" with Bannon in his White House office. ""I know there were a number of times where he met with Steve. And I think they have both said and repeated that that happened,"" she said in a Jan. 5 interview on Fox & Friends. ""We looked at the logs. We know that they met on multiple occasions. He was frequently seen meeting with him. So I think that's a pretty indisputable fact on that front."" So, while it may be the case that Trump did not personally grant Wolff access, his own press secretary says the author had access to administration officials at the White House. To the casual reader, Trump’s tweet could give the impression that he and Wolff never spoke — but that’s far from the case. While it may be the case that Trump never talked to Wolff with the express understanding that their discussion would later be incorporated into a book, the two men certainly spoke, though the length and nature of their conversations is not entirely clear. Wolff said he spent about three hours with Trump over the course of the campaign and at the White House. ""Whether he realized it was an interview or not, I don’t know, but it certainly was not off the record,"" Wolff said in a Jan. 5 interview on NBC’s Today. ""I spoke to him after the inauguration, yes. And I had spoken to, I mean I spent about three hours with the president over the course of the campaign and in the White House, so my window into Donald Trump is pretty significant."" For her part, Sanders does not dispute that the two men spoke. According to Sanders, their only conversation since Trump became president took the form of a brief phone call, which, at that time, was not related to Wolff’s book. ""There was one brief conversation that had nothing to do, originally, with the book,"" Sanders said at a Jan. 3 White House press briefing. ""It was, I think, around five to seven minutes in total since the president has taken office. And that’s the only interaction that he’s had."" Trump said, ""I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book."" The president may not have personally authorized it, but Wolff had more than a dozen interactions with officials at the White House, according to Trump’s own press secretary. Press corps members also spotted Wolff at the White House on multiple occasions. Sanders also said Wolff and Trump spoke by phone for ""five to seven minutes"" after Trump became president, which contradicts Trump’s artful phrasing as to their communication.

Taking a closer look at the 'Steele dossier' and Carter Page's warrant
","Critics of the federal investigation into claims President Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with the Russian government have latched onto a theory that the inquiry only began after the FBI received a controversial dossier funded by Democrats and littered with unproven allegations. But that, too, is unproven. On CNN Jan. 2, Florida International University law professor Elizabeth Foley claimed that the 35-page collection of research memos, which has come to be called the Steele Dossier, started a chain of events that led to the wiretapping of Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page. Here’s what she said, and how CNN’s Anderson Cooper and Jeffrey Toobin reacted. ""On July 7, Carter Page goes to Moscow to give a speech at a University,"" Foley said. ""On July 19, this is 2016, (former British intelligence officer Christopher) Steele submits a salacious dossier to the FBI about some sort of quid pro quo being discussed between Page and Russian oligarchs. He submits that to the FBI on July 19. About a month later we have the FBI going to the foreign intelligence surveillance court to get a wiretap, to get surveillance of Carter Page. And this is all based on a dossier."" ""You have no proof of that!"" Cooper interrupted. ""You don’t know that!"" echoed panelist Jeffrey Toobin. ""That’s what Jim Comey has suggested,"" Foley said. ""That’s what CNN reported in April (2017). And that’s also what the New York Times previously reported in April 2017. So, all of sudden now they are trying to walk back the genesis of this investigation and switch it to (Trump adviser George) Papadopoulos. If they really believe national security was at risk and there was some collusion why would they have waited four months?"" ""I'll double check this, professor, but I don’t believe that we reported that was the basis for this,"" Cooper responded. ""But I’ll double check it."" Cooper did look into it, and so did we. We can’t say what motivated the FBI to begin an investigation into Page, but the reporting that Foley said traced the genesis of the Page investigation to the Steele Dossier isn’t cut-and-dried. The dossier in question was compiled by a former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele and contained numerous explosive but unverified claims. The memos were compiled by a research firm called Fusion GPS, who was first hired by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative publication that was reporting on the Republican primary field. After the Republican primary, Fusion GPS was hired on behalf of Clinton’s campaign. That’s when the firm hired Steele. The dossier circulated among Washington lawmakers, intelligence agents and journalists for months before becoming public knowledge, when unnamed U.S. officials told CNN in January 2017 that intelligence officers presented Trump with a summary of the document. (Then BuzzFeed published its entirety.) The dossier claims that Page met with Russians and discussed quid-pro-quo deals relating to sanctions and Russia's interference in the election. Trump, himself, has blamed the dossier for launching the FBI probe into his campaign. WOW, @foxandfrlends “Dossier is bogus. Clinton Campaign, DNC funded Dossier. FBI CANNOT (after all of this time) VERIFY CLAIMS IN DOSSIER OF RUSSIA/TRUMP COLLUSION. FBI TAINTED.” And they used this Crooked Hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the Trump Campaign! Shortly after the original CNN broadcast where Foley made the claim, Cooper did his own fact-check of Foley’s claim. He read aloud an excerpt of a story CNN published on April 17. CNN reported that the FBI used the Russian dossier as ""part of the justification"" — not the only reason — to win approval to secretly monitor Carter. It went on to paraphrase unnamed officials ""familiar with the process,"" who said that if information from the dossier was used, it would only be after the FBI corroborated the information through its own investigation. ""The officials would not say what or how much was corroborated,"" CNN reported. ""U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials have said U.S. investigators did their own work, separate from the dossier, to support their findings that Russia tried to meddle in the 2016 presidential election in favor of Trump."" In other words, the dossier was part of the reported reason, but we really can’t say how much. In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Foley said CNN offered no evidence to support this assertion that the FBI did in fact corroborate the report other than paraphrasing an unnamed source. ""While the CNN report intimates that there may be other sources of information besides the dossier, neither CNN nor any of its sources proffer any clue as to what those sources may be, or even whether there is any reliable evidence that such sources actually exist,"" Foley said. As for the New York Times, Foley was referring to a report published on April 19 about Carter’s visit to Moscow that garnered the attention of the FBI. The report does not mention the dossier, but said the investigation spawned after his July 2016 trip to Moscow, in which he was critical of American policy toward Russia. ""It is unclear exactly what about Mr. Page’s visit drew the FBI’s interest: meetings he had during his three days in Moscow, intercepted communications of Russian officials speaking about him, or something else,"" it said. The CNN report says the dossier was cited by Comey in some of his briefings to members of Congress, but that doesn’t mean he suggested it was the basis of the probe. ""The dossier has also been cited by FBI Director James Comey in some of his briefings to members of Congress in recent weeks, as one of the sources of information the bureau has used to bolster its investigation, according to U.S. officials briefed on the probe,"" CNN reported. When we showed Foley this excerpt showing Comey used the dossier ""as one of"" the bureau’s sources, she pushed back again, saying ""innuendo is not fact."" She said the only facts reported by the CNN story are that the Steele dossier was relied on to justify the collusion investigation and that Comey had relayed information about the dossier, as salient to his agency’s investigation, to members of Congress. We also looked at transcripts of Comey’s testimony in front of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on June 8 to see what he’s said on the record. Comey would not answer publically whether the FBI was able to confirm anything in the Steele dossier, but he did respond to several questions about it. And in one instance, Comey described some material in the dossier as ""salacious and unverified."" ""The (intelligence community) leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming president to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified,"" he said. Foley said James Comey and news reporting showed the basis of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant for Carter Page was ""all based on a dossier."" This is not accurate. CNN and the New York Times never reported that the dossier was the basis for Carter’s probe. CNN reported that it ""part of the justification"" and the New York Times didn’t even mention the dossier. We couldn’t find any evidence that proved Comey suggested that Page’s warrant was ""all based on a dossier."" According to CNN’s unnamed sources, Comey has cited the dossier, but has not confirmed publically how much of it has been verified. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/jan/05/elizabeth-foley/taking-closer-look-steele-dossier-and-carter-pages/
"['States', 'Taxes', 'Texas', 'Ted Cruz']","
Ted Cruz says everyone getting tax cuts except some wealthy residents of Manhattan, San Francisco
","The nation’s new tax laws put in place by ruling Republicans won’t leave everyone paying less to Uncle Sam forever, projections show, mainly because nearly all legislated individual income-tax reductions expire after 2025. But Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, stirred our curiosity when he asserted that certain rich Americans would face increased taxes off the bat. ""By the way,"" Cruz said in Senate debate Dec. 19, 2017, ""there is one subset of people whose taxes will go up under this, the rich people in high-tax Democratic states. The irony of all the high dudgeon from our Democratic friends pounding the table about ‘this is a tax cut for the rich,’ the only people whose taxes are going up are the really rich,"" Cruz said. Cruz, seeking re-election in 2018, was even more specific, saying: ""The middle class, their taxes are all going down. The working class, their taxes are going down. Every taxpayer, their taxes are going down,"" Cruz said, ""except rich people in Manhattan and San Francisco. Some of them, their taxes may go up."" We unsuccessfully queried Cruz about how he reached his conclusion about higher taxes solely hitting plump cats in the Big Apple and The City (which--honest--is what San Francisco residents call their town). To be sure, studies of the plan signed into law by President Donald Trump suggest that many wealthy Americans will see tax cuts--while some will pay more. We didn’t confirm, though, that those likely paying more live only in San Francisco and Manhattan. But experts told us wealthier workers in high-tax states and cities are at risk of higher tabs in the main because the law limits to $10,000 how much anyone may deduct in state and local income taxes. Two studies signal plan’s 'winners, losers' Toward the end of 2017, PolitiFact in Washington looked at impact studies of the adopted tax plan by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan group that analyzes tax bills for Congress, and the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation. According to the committee, taxpayers stand to enjoy reductions in 2019 (the first year of its analysis) with the average tax rate decreasing in each of 11 income groupings. Yet not everyone is projected to see lower taxes every year. In 2027, the committee’s analysis says, taxpayers earning up to $75,000 a year would face average tax rates higher than what they faced under existing law with people in higher brackets still paying less than they would if the law hadn’t changed. Why the big changes before 2027? The primary reason is that the law phases out some of the individual tax cuts after 2025. Also, some inflation adjustments imposed by the law are less generous than previous ones. Separately, the center’s analysis indicates that from the get-go, some taxpayers within each income bracket will likely pay more in taxes--though 95 percent will see reductions or not lose ground. By phone to our inquiry, the center’s Mark Mazur pointed out that the analysis shows a subset of taxpayers in each quintile stand to pay more in taxes in the plan’s first year, 2018. At the low end, Table 4 states, 1.2 percent of taxpayers in the lowest income quintile will pay more; at the high end, the table indicates, 6.2 percent of taxpayers in the highest income quintile stand to pay more in taxes than if the law hadn’t changed. Also, the center’s breakdown suggests, nearly one in five of the nation’s tip-top wealthiest will see higher taxes. To be precise, the analysis says 16.2 percent of taxpayers in the top tenth of 1 percent in income will pay an average of $387,610 more in federal taxes in 2018 than if the law had gone unchanged: Income range Percentage with a tax cut in 2018 Average tax cut for those with a cut Percentage with a tax increase in 2018 Average tax increase for those with an increase Lowest 20 percent 53.9 percent - $130 1.2 percent $810 20th to 40th percentile 86.8 percent - $480 4.6 percent $740 40th to 60th percentile 91.3 percent - $1,090 7.3 percent $910 60th to 80th percentile 92.5 percent - $2,070 7.3 percent $1,360 80th to 90th percentile 92.3 percent - $3,370 7.6 percent $1,800 90th to 95th percentile 94.4 percent - $4,910 5.5 percent $1,890 95th to 99th percentile 97.3 percent - $13,890 2.7 percent $8,260 Top 1 percent 90.7 percent - $61,940 9.3 percent $93,910 Top 0.1 percent 83.7 percent - $285,490 16.2 percent $387,610 SOURCE: Report, Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, ""Distributional Analysis of the Conference Agreement for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,"" Dec. 18, 2017 Factors behind higher taxes ‘idiosyncratic’ We asked Mazur to explain why some Americans will pay more in taxes. Broadly, Mazur said, those paying more in 2018 will end up doing so for idiosyncratic reasons. For instance, Mazur said by email that larger ""families with lots of dependents who are not eligible for the child tax credit (for example because the children are too old or because the dependents are not children) could see a tax increase because the loss of personal exemptions could be greater than the increase in the standard deduction. ""In addition, some taxpayers with large amounts of deductions (e.g., moving expenses, casualty losses, alimony paid) could be made worse off under the new law,"" Mazur wrote. Also, Mazur and other experts said the $10,000 limit on deductible state and local tax payments could leave some taxpayers confronting higher federal taxes--though Mazur said that would apply across the country, not just to residents of San Francisco or Manhattan.  ""This can occur anywhere in the country, though states and localities with higher taxes generally would be the most likely to bump up against the $10,000 annual limit,"" he wrote. All this said, Mazur added, most people will still be better off tax-wise in 2018. We also heard back about Cruz’s claim from John Buhl of the Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank that has posted sample forecasts of the law’s effect on different earners. By email, Buhl said the ""people most likely to see some increase in taxes are higher income earners in high-tax states and localities who"" have heavily relied on state and local tax deductions. ""Generally speaking, those most likely to be impacted are in the 90th to 99th income percentiles,"" Buhl said. Buhl noted a wrinkle when it comes to the nation’s super-wealthy in that, he said, the top 1 percent of taxpayers hail from households that typically don't benefit from the state and local deduction; they instead face the federal alternative minimum tax levied on higher-income households that take a lot of deductions to ensure that they pay at least a minimum amount of tax. ""Given that, only some wealthier taxpayers will end up paying more,"" Buhl said. Experts in New York, California Tax experts in the states singled out by Cruz each told us that most taxpayers will pay less in the plan’s first years, but there will be people paying more. In New York, Edmund J. McMahon of the Albany-based Empire Center for Public Policy, a nonpartisan think tank that advocates policy reforms based on free-market principles, took note in a Dec. 13, 2017, blog post that despite the new law reducing tax rates for the nation’s highest earners, the combined federal, state and local income tax rate on the wage, salary, bonus and self-employment incomes of the highest-earning New York City residents would be going up by about a percentage point. By phone and email, McMahon called Cruz’s claim generally correct—though McMahon said that what the Texan said applies to wealthy residents in all of New York’s boroughs, not just Manhattan where ""income millionaires are most concentrated,"" McMahon said. The effects also will extend beyond the wealthiest residents of San Francisco, McMahon said, in that high earners across California will be affected by the cap on deductible state and local taxes. McMahon otherwise speculated that Cruz with his locale-specific claim ""was playing to the stereotypes people have"" about where the very wealthiest Americans abide. Annette Nellen, a San Jose State University expert on tax law, provided us with a document she drafted spelling out the likely tax effects on different taxpayers. Generally, Nellen’s presentation states, most individuals will see tax reductions though individual results will depend, in part, on types of income and amounts; the ages of dependent children; and whether lost deductions drive up taxes more than savings attributable to reduced rates. Our ruling Cruz said that under the tax changes, every ""taxpayer, their taxes are going down, except rich people in Manhattan and San Francisco. Some of them, their taxes may go up."" Cruz clearly engages in hyperbole here, though the gist of his statement holds water in that most taxpayers are projected to enjoy lower federal taxes through 2025. Also, those most likely to see their taxes go up include wealthy wage earners in high-tax states and cities. Still, projections show that across income groups, not every taxpayer will see lower taxes, contrary to what Cruz said, and many of those who do see tax savings are likely to lose them after 2025. It’s also so that residents of high-tax states and cities at risk of higher taxes aren’t limited to Manhattan and San Francisco.

"['Economy', 'New York', 'Brian Kolb']","
Does NY spend more to create jobs than any other state?
","Assembly Republican Leader Brian M. Kolb said New York state economic development spending outpaces every other state by a large measure. Kolb, a 2018 candidate for governor, claimed New York state spends more than the next three highest spending states combined. ""New York state spends more than $8 billion in taxpayer money each year on job-creation programs - more than the combined total of the next three largest states,"" Kolb wrote in an op-ed. Republican lawmakers have targeted the state’s economic development strategy, saying little progress has been made since Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo took office in 2011. Cuomo, conversely, rarely makes a public appearance without touting the state’s growth. In the summer of 2016, PolitiFact New York rated as True the governor's claim that 800,000 jobs had been created, the unemployment rate fell by almost half, and the state had more private sector jobs than ever before. But is New York state spending as much as Kolb indicated? Where’s the number from? Kolb’s spokesperson said the development spending amount came from a June article in the Democrat & Chronicle newspaper in Rochester. ""The W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research found New York awarded $8 billion in incentives in 2015 — three times as much as the next three largest states combined,"" according to the article. The institute is one of the nation's leading nonpartisan sources of research and analysis on employment trends in the U.S. The article also cited research from the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan government watchdog group, that likewise found more than $8 billion spent each year on economic development incentives in New York state. The report The report by the W.E. Upjohn Institute tracked at least $4.9 billion spent on economic development incentives in New York state based on state government reporting in 2015. State and local governments spend that money in several different ways, ranging from tax credits for film companies to property tax waivers. The next three highest spending states were California, Texas, and Louisiana. They spent a combined total of about $5.6 billion, more than New York state's spending. California, the second highest, spent about half as much as New York state. Timothy J. Bartik, a senior economist at the institute and the report’s author, said New York state likely spent more on economic development. His report, based on a simulation model, arrived at a higher estimate for New York state: $8.2 billion. The model is the only one of its kind. Experts we spoke to that specialize in similar research said its methodolgy is credible. The model used the state’s laws and commonly used tax incentives to predict total economic development spending beyond numbers reported by state government. Some incentives may not be properly counted in state reporting, according to Bartik’s research. Bartik said Kolb’s statement on New York state’s amount of spending is accurate based on that data. ""I would be inclined to say that the statement is true but based on an estimate of state and local incentives,"" Bartik said. The other part of Kolb’s claim does not add up. The other three high spending states — California, New Jersey, and Texas — spent a combined $8.8 billion, more than New York’s estimate, according to his model. ""In terms of the bigger picture, New York state is well above average in the magnitude of incentives it provides,"" Bartik said. Empire State Development, the state’s economic development agency, did not provide any data to support or refute Bartik’s estimates. A few caveats New York state is bound to spend more money than other states because its economy is larger, but the state still ranked high when Bartik considered the size of each economy. Three other states ranked higher than New York in reported economic development spending as a percentage of their economies: Louisiana, New Mexico, and South Carolina. New York ranked third behind New Mexico and Tennessee when numbers from the report’s simulation model are used instead. The report also combined both state and local economic incentives in its data. There are state incentives, like tax credits for film companies, and local incentives, like property tax abatements. More than half the cost of economic development was at the local level in 2016, according to a report from the Citizens Budget Commission. Of the $8.6 billion in tax breaks or direct spending they found in New York, about $4.6 billion was local. That’s not necessarily an important distinction to make, Bartik said. ""In New York, as in all other states, local governments are creatures of the state,"" Bartik said. ""They only have the powers and functions that the state decides to give them."" Our ruling Kolb said ""New York state spends more than $8 billion in taxpayer money each year on job-creation programs - more than the combined total of the next three largest states."" Research suggests Kolb is right on the amount, but wrong about New York state exceeding the next three states combined. The report Kolb cited also includes local government spending, so the $8 billion cannot be attributed completely to the state. His statement is partially accurate. On balance, we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2018/jan/05/brian-kolb/does-ny-spend-more-create-jobs-any-other-state/

Donald Trump blames Democratic states on lack of data showing voter fraud
","President Donald Trump blamed Democratic states for the demise of his voter fraud commission. ""Many mostly Democrat States refused to hand over data from the 2016 Election to the Commission On Voter Fraud,"" Trump tweeted Jan. 4. ""They fought hard that the Commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally. System is rigged, must go to Voter I.D."" Many mostly Democrat States refused to hand over data from the 2016 Election to the Commission On Voter Fraud. They fought hard that the Commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally. System is rigged, must go to Voter I.D. Trump disbanded the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity on Jan. 3 and asked the Department of Homeland Security to review its initial findings and determine next courses of action. The commission was plagued by infighting, multiple lawsuits and pushback from many states. We will fact-check whether it was mostly Democratic states that refused to hand over the data. In May 2017, Trump issued an executive order establishing the voter fraud commission headed up by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Trump had made repeated misleading claims about massive voter fraud and election rigging during and after the election. While some instances of voter fraud have occurred, national experts have said fraud is isolated and rare. The commission in June asked state election officials for information that included voters' names, registration status, political party affiliation, voting history, partial Social Security numbers. Many of states did agree to provide some data to the commission, although many required that the commission meet certain criteria, such as paying a fee. Still, the commission didn’t get all the data it wanted, even from the states that agreed to comply. The AP found that states that agreed to comply did withhold some details that the commission had sought, such as only releasing information considered public under state law. (Even Kobach said that his state of Kansas couldn’t provide Social Security information because it wasn’t available under state law.) According to the AP as of Oct. 22, the states that denied the request were: California, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia and Wyoming. Arizona and Illinois were categorized as undecided. There are several holes in Trump’s argument that is was mostly Democratic states. Some states that denied or didn’t comply with the commission’s request ultimately voted for Trump. Arizona, Kentucky, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee and Wyoming all voted for Trump. That undercuts Trump’s portrayal of Democratic states being the only ones fighting the commission. Some states don’t fall neatly into one partisan category. In Illinois, the bipartisan state board of elections sent a letter to the commission raising concerns and seeking more information. Illinois is generally thought of as a blue state and voted for Clinton, but the board that acted on the Trump commission request includes both Democrats and Republicans. Kentucky, which reliably votes for Republicans in presidential elections and went overwhelmingly for Trump, has an elected Democratic Secretary of State, Alison Lundergan-Grimes. She was the one who officially rejected the commission’s request. Some Republican officials rejected or didn’t comply with the commission’s request. This includes Arizona, North Dakota, Tennessee and Wyoming. Ed Murray, the Republican secretary of state in Wyoming, said in July, ""I am going to safeguard the privacy of Wyoming’s voters because of my strong belief in a citizen’s right of privacy."" He said that elections are the responsibility of the states and the request could lead to federal overreach. North Dakota also does not have voter registration and state law forbids the state from releasing details about voters. In Arizona, Republican Secretary of State Michele Reagan called the commission's request a ""hastily organized experiment."" Even the states that agreed to comply didn’t provide everything the commission requested. The AP found that states that agreed to comply still withheld some details the commission had sought and only released information considered public under state law. Even Kobach’s own state, Kansas, didn’t allow for the release of Social Security data. Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner, a Republican, said he would only disclose public records and not Social Security or driver’s license numbers. ""We absolutely will not provide any information that is not already publicly available,"" he said in July. ""The responsibility for the accuracy and fairness of our elections process in Florida lies with us, not with the federal government in Washington, D.C."" A final note on the part of Trump’s tweet that said states that didn’t comply did so ""because they know that many people are voting illegally."" PolitiFact has repeatedly found no evidence of widespread national voter fraud. While we were working on this item the Washington Post’s The Fact Checker published their own analysis and used a different methodology but reached similar conclusions. Trump tweeted that ""mostly Democrat states refused to hand over data."" While there are multiple ways to define states as Democratic -- and the White House didn’t explain the definition Trump was using -- he has a point that a variety of predominantly Democratic states were among the states that went the furthest in opposing the commission’s request. They include California, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico and Vermont. However, six states won by Trump -- Kentucky, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Wyoming and Arizona -- didn’t comply with the commission’s request, and other Republican states complied only in part with the commission’s request.

In reality, the story traces back to an article in Politico.

The questionnaire, more than 100 pages long, includes questions on the applicant’s employment, criminal and residential history and also asks about personal subjects such as about an applicant’s mental health and use of illicit drugs.

Salon said that nearly one in five taxpayers will no longer be able to use miscellaneous deductions, writing, ""Why are Trump and Congressional Republicans dinging first responders, teachers, nurses, traveling salespeople and even those who pay someone to prepare their income tax returns?

Did Attorney General Jeff Sessions reverse on enforcing marijuana laws? No
","A scoop by the Associated Press on federal enforcement of marijuana laws drew an angry morning tweet from Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo. The AP story said that the days of a lighter federal touch on marijuana violations were ending. Gardner expressed a sense of betrayal. ""This reported action directly contradicts what Attorney General Sessions told me prior to his confirmation,"" he wrote Jan. 4. ""With no prior notice to Congress, the Justice Department has trampled on the will of the voters in CO and other states."" This reported action directly contradicts what Attorney General Sessions told me prior to his confirmation. With no prior notice to Congress, the Justice Department has trampled on the will of the voters in CO and other states. A few hours later, the Justice Department announced the policy shift. In the words of the department’s press release, there would be ""a return to the rule of law and the rescission of previous guidance documents."" Federal prosecutors were free to enforce federal law according to rules that had been in place for decades. Gardner clearly thought Sessions had reversed himself, but we wanted to see if that was accurate. Based on what we heard from Gardner and his staff, whatever promises Sessions might have made to let states such as Colorado set their own rules for pot were spoken in private, not written or said in public. That’s nothing we fact-checkers can verify or refute. And looking at Sessions’ public statements, every legal scholar we reached told us the same thing: Sessions never promised to keep the Obama-era guidelines in place. Under federal law, marijuana is illegal. Congress could change that, but it hasn’t. As more and more states took matters into their own hands for both medical and recreational use, they put the Justice Department in a legal bind. It could enforce federal law, or effectively bow to state law. The Obama administration began issuing prosecution guidelines in 2009 and in 2013 settled on ones crafted by Deputy Attorney General James Cole. Cole’s memo basically left it to state and local agencies to enforce their own laws, while the feds would focus on marijuana when it was tied to gangs or drug cartels, violence (especially involving firearms), or was part of schemes to sell pot in states where it remained illegal. Cole's memo urged federal prosecutors to use their own discretion. Sessions has never hid his opposition to marijuana. At an April 4, 2016, Senate hearing he said that ""good people don’t smoke marijuana,"" and that the government needed to send the message ""that this drug is dangerous, you cannot play with it, it is not funny, it's not something to laugh about."" He called the Obama administration's approach one of Obama’s ""great failures."" In light of those comments, the issue came up at Sessions’ confirmation hearings. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., asked him if he would use federal law to prosecute sick people who are using marijuana legally in their state. ""I won't commit to never enforcing federal law, Sen. Leahy, but absolutely it's a problem of resources for the federal government,"" Sessions said. Leahy pressed him on whether he agreed with the Cole memo guidelines. Sessions avoided a direct answer. He said some of them were valuable but added, ""Using good judgment about how to handle these cases will be a responsibility of mine. I know it won't be an easy decision, but I will try to do my duty in a fair and just way."" At a Nov. 14, 2017, House Judiciary hearing, Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, asked Sessions what the Justice Department’s marijuana policy was. ""Our policy is the same, really, fundamentally, as the Holder-Lynch policy, which is that the federal law remains in effect, and a state can legalize marijuana for its law enforcement purposes, but it still remains illegal with regard to federal purposes,"" Sessions said. Gardner followed up his tweet with a speech on the Senate floor. He said his conversations with Sessions had left him with a clear sense that the federal government would not interfere with Colorado’s legal use of recreational pot. ""Prior to his confirmation, then-Sen. Sessions told me there weren’t any plans to reverse the Cole memorandum,"" Gardner said Jan. 4. ""Then-Sen. Sessions said marijuana wasn’t going to be on President Trump’s agenda. That it was something they weren’t going to deal with."" However, Gardner offered nothing in writing from Sessions to back up his recollection of those conversations. We reached a handful law professors who follow federal drug policy. Not one found the new policy inconsistent with what Sessions has said before. ""I don’t think one can accuse Sessions of changing his mind,"" said Franklin Snyder at Texas A&M University School of Law. ""What he said about Holder-Lynch was accurate. I suspect that some people read his words as suggesting support for the Cole memorandum, but that’s not exactly what he said."" Robert Mikos at Vanderbilt Law School agreed. ""It seems perfectly consistent with what he has said with regard to marijuana law in the past,"" Mikos told us. Alex Kreit at Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego said Sessions’ answers had given him ""wiggle room, and he always said that policies would be evaluated."" The more surprising shift for Kreit was how this runs against what President Donald Trump said on the campaign trail. At an October 2015 event in Nevada, Trump said ""in terms of marijuana and legalization, I think that should be a state issue."" He said much the same in Colorado. A key question now is what the government does under the new policy. ""Federal prosecutors have a lot of discretion, so neither the Cole memo nor this new announcement guarantee any change in actual prosecutions,"" said Robert J. MacCoun at Stanford Law School. If there’s a crackdown in the next few weeks, the answer will be evident. Otherwise, it might take a while before the impact, if any, bubbles up. While some might have reason to think that Sessions changed his stance on marijuana prosecutions, there’s no hard proof that he did. In public, he always affirmed that marijuana is illegal under federal law, and he never promised to abide by an Obama-era memo that down-pedaled prosecutions.

Despite David Clarke's tweet, no evidence Hillary Clinton ever called Democratic voters 'stupid'
","Getting himself briefly banned from Twitter made us wonder whether David A. Clarke Jr., the provocative Donald Trump supporter and former Milwaukee County sheriff, had tweeted anything lately that we should fact check. He had. On Dec. 30, 2017, Clarke tweeted this: LYING Lib media spreads FAKE NEWS about me and @realDonaldTrump to fool their liberal followers into believing LIES because as Mrs. Bill Clinton once said, ""Look, the average DEMOCRAT VOTER is just plain STUPID. They’re easy to manipulate."" Classic! Clarke included with his tweet an image that pictures Clinton, the alleged quote and a reference to a book originally published in 2004 by Dick Morris. Morris was an adviser to President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton’s husband, and later became an ardent Hillary Clinton basher. So, Clarke claims that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president in 2016, once said ""the average Democrat voter is just plain stupid, they’re easy to manipulate."" Do you remember any news headlines about that? Catching up with Clarke Despite being a staunch conservative, Clarke ran as a Democrat for sheriff in heavily Democratic Milwaukee County. He held the post from 2002, eventually becoming a favorite of conservatives across the country as he spoke out on national issues, until resigning in August 2017. Then he took his current job, as a senior adviser with the pro-Trump America First Action Super PAC. Clarke had been a surrogate for Trump during Trump’s 2016 campaign against Clinton. CNN reported on Jan. 2, 2018, that days earlier, Clarke was temporarily blocked from tweeting after Twitter user complaints alerted the company that three of his messages violated Twitter’s terms of service. Clarke was placed in read-only mode until he deleted three tweets that seemed to call for violence against members of the media. In one of the deleted tweets, Clarke said: When LYING LIB MEDIA makes up FAKE NEWS to smear me, the ANTIDOTE is to go right at them. Punch them in the nose & MAKE THEM TASTE THEIR OWN BLOOD. Nothing gets a bully like LYING LIB MEDIA""S attention better than to give them a taste of their own blood #neverbackdown. Claim against Clinton The quote Clarke attributes to Clinton was among those featured in a March 2016 PolitiFact National article that was headlined, ""7 Hillary Clinton quotes on the Internet that are complete fakes."" Which doesn’t get Clarke’s claim off to a good start. The article said Snopes.com had debunked the alleged quote. The Snopes fact check, originally published in December 2015, rated the quote false, saying: This statement was not uttered by Hillary Clinton, nor was it published in the 2005 book Rewriting History by Dick Morris as something she ostensibly said. We found no record of this quote in any major publication or news account. In fact, the first mention of this item came in October 2015, more than a decade after Morris’ book was published, on a Tumblr page dedicated to generating fake Hillary Clinton quotes. In addition, Morris told us by email that the quote attributed to Clinton is ""not true."" Indeed, had the quote been real, it would have caused a storm of news coverage. Clarke did not respond to our emails and phone call. Our rating Clarke says that Hillary Clinton once said ""the average Democrat voter is just plain stupid, they’re easy to manipulate."" Not only is there no evidence to confirm the alleged quote, which surfaced on a site dedicated to generating fake Clinton quotes, it had been debunked two years earlier. That makes Clarke’s statement false and ridiculous -- Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2018/jan/05/david-clarke-jr/despite-david-clarkes-tweet-no-evidence-hillary-cl/

Donald Trump says there's 'substantial evidence of voter fraud.' There isn't
","President Donald Trump is closing the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, a panel to investigate voter fraud that had attracted controversy during its short life. The commission -- headed by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach -- had been ""bedeviled by internal dissension, threats of litigation and the refusal of some states to provide information. Its last known meeting was Sept. 12,"" NBC reported. The panel included a few Democrats, but its membership was majority Republican. One Democratic member of the commission even filed a lawsuit, demanding to be kept abreast of its activities. Separately, the Government Accountability Office, a federal agency, announced in October 2017 that it would probe its handling of voter files and other issues, in response to calls by Democratic lawmakers. In a statement on Jan. 3, 2018, announcing his decision to disband the commission, Trump said, ""Despite substantial evidence of voter fraud, many states have refused to provide the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity with basic information relevant to its inquiry. Rather than engage in endless legal battles at taxpayer expense, today I signed an executive order to dissolve the Commission, and have asked the Department of Homeland Security to review these issues and determine next courses of action."" PolitiFact is separately checking a different assertion by Trump, that ""mostly Democrat states refused to hand over data"" to the commission. In this fact-check, we’re looking at whether Trump is correct that there is ""substantial evidence of voter fraud."" This is hardly the first time Trump has made an assertion of this sort. He has repeatedly claimed the existence of massive voter fraud and election rigging, which we’ve debunked again and again and again and again and again and again and again. Trump has not yet produced any evidence that supports these claims, and the White House did not respond to another request for this article. The White House’s previous argument In a press briefing on Jan. 24, 2017, a reporter asked his then-press secretary Sean Spicer how Trump came to believe that it’s possible that illegal votes were to blame for his popular vote loss. ""I think there's been studies,"" Spicer responded. ""There's one that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens. There's other studies that have been presented to him. It's a belief he maintains."" We determined that Spicer was conflating a couple different studies, and that those studies have been erroneously used to prop up claims that noncitizens have swayed elections by voting illegally. There is no study that shows 14 percent of the votes cast in 2008 were cast by noncitizens. That would have added up to more than 18 million fraudulent votes — an implausible assertion, considering the total noncitizen population was about 22.5 million in 2010. As for the study that ""came out of Pew in 2008,"" it actually came out in 2012, and it’s about outdated voter rolls -- not fraudulent votes. The 2012 Pew study -- found that about 24 million, or one in every eight, voter registrations in the United States are inaccurate or no longer valid, but it did not find evidence of actual voter fraud. The study was about record-keeping that is badly managed and in disarray. David Becker, the former director of Pew’s election program, tweeted in November 2016 that ""we found millions of out of date registration records due to people moving or dying, but found no evidence that voter fraud resulted."" Meanwhile, the study that shows that ""14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens"" has been widely criticized for its methodology. Many credible researchers have panned the study as methodologically unsound for using an opt-in Internet poll originally designed to survey citizens and not considering possible survey response error. In a blog post, one of the authors, Old Dominion professor Jesse Richman, said he stands by his study, but ""our results suggest that almost all elections in the U.S. are not determined by noncitizen participation, with occasional and very rare potential exceptions."" Voter fraud uncommon Other research suggests that voter fraud is not widespread. • News21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found just 56 cases of noncitizens voting between 2000 and 2011. • A report by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law found that most cases of noncitizens voting were accidental. ""Although there are a few recorded examples in which noncitizens have apparently registered or voted, investigators have concluded that they were likely not aware that doing so was improper,"" reads the 2007 report. • In 2012, Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s administration tried to crack down on noncitizens voting by comparing driver's license data against voter rolls. The Florida Department of State created a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens that had voted. That number was whittled down to 2,700, then to about 200 before the purge was stopped amid criticism that the data was flawed given the number of false positives — including a Brooklyn-born World War II vet. Ultimately, only 85 people were removed from the rolls. Meanwhile, ProPublica, an investigative journalism project, tweeted that ""we had 1,100 people monitoring the vote on Election Day. We saw no evidence the election was ‘rigged’ "" and ""no evidence that undocumented immigrants voted illegally."" Expert opinion In our previous articles on this topic, numerous election experts dismissed assertions like those made by Trump. Asked again for this article, experts agreed that nothing new had emerged as a result of the commission’s work. Trump’s claim ""is not accurate at all,"" said Rick Hasen, a University of California-Irvine law professor who specializes in election law. ""There has been no proof of substantial voter fraud in the 2016 election. We have seen really just a smattering of isolated cases."" Lorraine Minnite, a Rutgers University political scientist and author of The Myth of Voter Fraud, said that her efforts to track the issue since 2001, including as an expert witness, has enabled her to study election processes up close in such states as Wisconsin, Texas, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and Kansas. Her conclusion? ""I am not aware of any evidence of substantial voter fraud ever being offered or presented to state legislatures adopting voter ID laws, or in any of the litigation in which states, as defendants, have brought forth such evidence to defend why they adopted the laws,"" Minnite said. Our ruling In his statement, Trump said there is ""substantial evidence of voter fraud."" That wasn’t accurate before, and it isn’t accurate now. We rate the statement False.

Top NC Republican accuses Democratic governor of halting the death penalty
","A North Carolina prosecutor announced recently that he’ll seek the death penalty for inmates who killed four people during an attempted prison escape. According to Republican state Sen. Phil Berger, the Senate leader, and Tim Moore, the state House speaker, the state’s top Democrats are standing in the way of the state serving justice to the prison employees who died in the October attacks. Capital punishment is on the law books in North Carolina and Berger says there are currently 143 inmates on death row. However, there hasn’t been an execution since 2006. Berger and Moore contend that’s because Gov. Roy Cooper, the former attorney general, and Josh Stein, who was elected attorney general in 2016, have failed to take legal action to counter court cases that are blocking executions. They released a joint statement on Dec. 8. Berger, specifically, was quoted as saying: ""For over a decade, death penalty opponents like Roy Cooper and Josh Stein have imposed a de-facto moratorium on capital punishment in North Carolina, using every legal trick possible – including inaction – to delay death sentences handed down by juries and deny justice to victims."" He continued: ""No matter what they say, Cooper’s and Stein’s indifference and failure to fight the moratorium endangers the lives of prison employees in close proximity to hardened murderers with nothing left to lose, who see no possibility they will face execution for killing again."" Do Cooper and Stein oppose the death penalty? Are they using the legal system to block executions, as Berger and Moore imply? What’s the holdup? The last execution in North Carolina, in 2006, put to death Samuel Flippen, a 36-year-old who was convicted in the beating death of his 2-year-old stepdaughter 12 years prior to his execution. Since then, North Carolina has been one of several states that’s in a holding pattern while the courts consider legal arguments against death penalty practices. Raleigh-based television station WRAL reported last year that that North Carolina is ""caught in morass of various state and federal court rulings."" One legal challenge relates to the protocol for lethal injections and whether they’re cruel and unusual. While that lawsuit makes its way through the courts, Wake County Superior Court Judge Donald Stephens in 2014 blocked the use of lethal injection in the state. Stephens later retired, and the case remains unresolved. ""That litigation is in the trial court and the injunction remains in place until the Court approves a new protocol and all appeals are exhausted,"" said Laura Brewer, a Stein spokeswoman. The other legal challenges stem from the Racial Justice Act, a short-lived law that allowed inmates to use local and statewide statistics in claims that racial bias played a role in their cases. The act was adopted in 2009, largely along party lines, and was rewritten in 2012 and then repealed in 2013 after Republicans won majorities in the General Assembly. Some of the cases are in active litigation, Brewer said. ""Some have been fully briefed by the parties (including by the AG’s office for the State) and are awaiting argument at the North Carolina Supreme Court,"" she wrote in an email. ""The Supreme Court has not set an argument date."" What Cooper, Stein say Cooper served as attorney general for 16 years, from 2001 to 2016. We contacted Cooper’s office about his stance on the death penalty. Despite the fact that much of his party’s base opposes the death penalty, Cooper spokeswoman Noelle Talley pointed to his record as proof he supports it. ""As Attorney General, Gov. Cooper did his duty to uphold capital punishment sentences handed down by juries in accordance with the law, and 27 executions were carried out in North Carolina during his time as AG before court orders prevented executions,"" Talley wrote in an email. She provided a link to the online list of the executions provided on the N.C. Department of Public Safety website. Stein was elected last year and he doesn’t have much of a record with death penalty cases, so we looked through news reports to see what he said on the campaign trail last year. Stein told WRAL in August 2016 that he backs the death penalty. ""I support the death penalty because I believe that certain crimes are so heinous that it is the appropriate punishment,"" Stein said. But he emphasized that ""the state needs to take care to avoid racial bias that has contributed to a de facto moratorium (on executions) in the state."" Stein took the same position during a debate in Asheboro last September, The News & Observer reported. To conclude the first part of our fact check, Cooper has a record of enforcing the death penalty and Stein is on the record supporting it – despite the fact that it’s unpopular with many Democrats. So at this point, it would seem like a stretch to describe them as death penalty opponents. But what have they done? Berger and Moore’s statement suggests that Cooper and Stein have used their powers to further prolong the moratorium. Berger said Cooper and Stein used ""every trick possible"" to impose the moratorium. Brewer, Stein’s spokeswoman, said the attorney general’s office has opposed claims by Racial Justice Act defendants. ""Stein and then-Attorney General Cooper have made numerous pleadings on the state’s behalf in these cases opposing the claims"" regarding both the Racial Justice Act and the lethal injection case. ""Neither Attorney General Stein nor then-Attorney General Cooper have filed pleadings supporting the claims,"" she said. And a WRAL story from 2007 quotes attorneys for Cooper, then the attorney general, arguing against attempts to block executions until the state resolved a case related to the presence of physicians at executions. Cooper and Stein didn’t file the lawsuits delaying executions or take the side of those who did. Have they used other, more subtle legal strategies for keeping the cases stuck in court? ‘Not the roadblock’ Two death penalty opponents said they’re unaware of any action Cooper has taken at any point in his career to block executions. Kristin Collins, associate director of public information at the Durham-based Center for Death Penalty Litigation, described Cooper as ""very aggressive in capital prosecutions"" when he was attorney general. Collins added that Cooper ""certainly opposed the stay when it was requested by the inmates"" in the cases that have halted executions. And with the Racial Justice Act, ""the attorney general is the only one actively involved in these lawsuits and they’ve done nothing besides fight for the case of the state, which argues that these death sentences should be carried out."" James Coleman, a Duke University professor and director of the Center for Criminal Justice and Professional Responsibility, said neither Cooper nor Stein is in a position now to affect the outcome of the legal challenges. ""We’re not at a place where the governor or attorney general could do anything even if they wanted to resume executions,"" Coleman said. ""They’re not the roadblock."" Bob Orr, who served from 1995 to 2004 as a justice on the N.C. Supreme Court, said he’s not familiar with Stein’s position but said Cooper’s staff fought to uphold the law. ""I was on the Supreme Court for 10 years. A number of executions took place. We handled a substantial number of death penalty appeals. It’s the singular most difficult part of the job,"" Orr said. ""I never heard (Cooper) say that he’s personally opposed to the death penalty and certainly members of his staff aggressively opposed appeals (of executions),"" Orr said. A ‘back-door attempt’ PolitiFact asked Berger’s office for proof that Cooper and Stein prolonged court reviews of the legal challenges. They provided none. On the day we emailed to say we’d found no evidence of Cooper or Stein supporting challenges to the court cases, Berger and Moore released a new statement once again criticizing Cooper and Stein for their inaction. Auth, Berger’s spokesperson, also followed up with an email to PolitiFact. She said Cooper and Stein could use the attorney general’s office to fight injunctions against state laws. She also argued that Stein, in 2009 as a state senator, contributed to the execution stoppage by voting for the Racial Justice Act. Supporters of the act said it was needed because statistics showed the death penalty was used disproportionately against black defendants. A Michigan State University study of capital cases in North Carolina between 1990 and 2010 shows that qualified black jurors were more than twice as likely as whites to be removed from juries by prosecutors. Many Republicans viewed the legislation as a ""back-door attempt to get rid of the death penalty,"" as former state Sen. Thom Goolsby said at the time. Goolsby later led the repeal of the act. Former state Rep. Paul ""Skip"" Stam of Apex, an attorney, echoed that sentiment. ""Any knowledgeable public lawyer would have realized that the RJA would be an indefinite moratorium on the death penalty for first degree murderers,"" Stam said in a recent email. ""By 2012, it was clear as the nose on your face that the RJA was an indefinite moratorium on the death penalty and irrational to boot (all the white murderers on death row claimed racial discrimination and filed petitions to stop their executions - so far successfully),"" Stam continued. ""And yet, Sen. Josh Stein voted against the 2012 legislation to effectively do away with these aspects of the RJA."" Our ruling In the Dec. 8 joint statement with Moore, Berger said Cooper and Stein oppose the death penalty and have used ""every legal trick possible – including inaction – to delay death sentences."" Berger’s office provided no evidence showing that Cooper and Stein have sided with death penalty opponents in court. Rather, Berger pointed to Stein’s vote on one bill and, in a vague claim, said the duo should’ve pressured the courts to expedite their review of death penalty cases. It’s fair to criticize how Cooper and Stein spend their resources and tie Stein to the Racial Justice Act. But those arguments alone don’t prove that they oppose the death penalty or have used legal ""tricks"" to delay executions. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/jan/03/phil-berger/top-nc-republican-accuses-democratic-governor-halt/

White House is misleading by citing only cuts, not hikes, in tax bill
","In its ""1600 Daily"" email to supporters and members of the public, the White House touted the tax bill that President Donald Trump signed in late December as a highlight of 2017. The email said that the new law would be ""kicking the American economy into high gear with $5.5 trillion in tax cuts, 1.7 million new jobs, and more than 60 record highs for the Dow Jones index."" Here’s a screenshot: That $5.5 trillion figure caught the eye of a reader, who wrote PolitiFact to note that the figure most frequently applied to the bill in news accounts is $1.5 trillion. So what’s going on? When we checked into it, we found that $5.5 trillion is a misleading number because it only focuses on one side of the ledger. The law does include roughly $5.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years, which is the standard time frame for studying bills of this sort. (This just measures the cuts themselves without taking into account any possible economic growth spurred by the cuts.) However, the law also includes roughly $4 trillion in tax increases. When you add the two numbers together, the net change is roughly $1.5 trillion. So the White House is enjoying its dessert (the tax cuts) while ignoring the vegetables (the tax hikes). That provides a skewed version of the bills, tax policy experts say. Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that the $5.5 trillion figure ""is misleading if it’s the only one cited. If one figure was going to be cited, it should be the net cost of the bill — $1.5 trillion."" He noted, however, that the White House did use a more accurate formulation in a more detailed web page dated Dec. 21, 2017, that explains the bill’s provisions. On that web page, the White House wrote that the bill ""provides $5.5 trillion in tax cuts"" but that it will also ""raise $4 trillion in revenue to help offset tax cuts."" Our ruling Trump said the recently enacted tax law includes ""$5.5 trillion in tax cuts."" Putting it that way ignores that the bill also includes $4 trillion in tax increases, for a net of $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2018/jan/03/donald-trump/white-house-misleading-citing-only-cuts-not-hikes-/

Donald Trump wrong about how long GOP held Alabama Senate seat
","When comments by Steve Bannon from a forthcoming book surfaced on Jan. 3, it created a media storm — and a rift between President Donald Trump and Bannon, his former chief strategist. Among the blockbuster quotes that Bannon gave journalist Michael Wolff referred to a meeting that included Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer, according to news reports of an excerpt. ""Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad s---, and I happen to think it's all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately,"" Bannon said, according to the book. Hours after news of the book’s contents broke on Jan. 3, 2018, the president released a statement critical of Bannon. Here’s a portion: ""Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates, often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican party. ""Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn’t as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans."" It wasn’t the most noteworthy part of Trump’s statement, but when he said that that Bannon that the Alabama seat had been held ""for more than thirty years by Republicans,"" he was off by almost a decade. The seat in question is the one in which Democrat Doug Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore weeks earlier. It was the subject of a special election because its previous elected occupant, Jeff Sessions, left to become Trump’s attorney general. (By coincidence, Jones was being sworn in as the state’s new senator on the same day that the news of Wolff’s book was dominating political discussion.) Seeing Trump’s statement, several political observers, including the Washington Post’s Paul Kane and Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, noted that the last Democrat to occupy the seat had been Sessions’ predecessor, Howell Heflin. FWIW, fact checking Trump's Bannon statement, Republicans had only held the Alabama Senate seat for 21 yrs, not ""more than 30"". (Judge Hefflin, D, retired in '96.)I'll leave psycho-analysis to others. Basic fact error here - the Alabama Senate seat that Jones (D) won had been held by Republicans since 1996, so about 20 years, not ""more than 30."" Howell Heflin (D) held it prior to the 1996 election. I realize this is nitpicky but it's also characteristically sloppy from this WH https://t.co/s4RTIlVbcc Heflin retired in 1996, making the actual period of Republican control 21 years, not 30. The late Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala. As for Alabama’s other Senate seat, it has been held by Richard Shelby since his first election victory in 1986. Shelby was elected as a Democrat, but switched to the Republican Party shortly after the GOP took control of both chambers of Congress in November 1994. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. One last bit of trivia: Earlier in his career, Jones worked as an aide for Heflin, who died in 2005. On election night, Jones called Heflin his ""mentor."" Our ruling Trump said the Senate seat won by Jones had been ""held for more than thirty years by Republicans."" It hasn’t been that long. It’s been 21 years since Democrat Howell Heflin retired, paving the way for his successor, Sessions, and Sessions’ elected successor, Jones.
