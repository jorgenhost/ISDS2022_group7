Rep. Ted Poe says new Medicare rules require nine billing codes for turkey injuries
","
Doctors’ offices, already burdened by federal billing bureaucracy, will soon find themselves pecked to death by new rules, Texas congressman Ted Poe says. 
New diagnosis codes required for reimbursement are so specific, he told Fox Business Network host John Stossel, there are a set of them just for injuries caused by turkeys. 
""Whether you run into a turkey or the turkey runs into you, you're pecked by a turkey or you're bitten by a turkey, there's a difference between being pecked and being bitten,"" he said in an interview April 25, 2013. ""So they have nine codes for turkeys."" 
Poe, a fifth-term Republican who’s a member of the Tea Party Caucus, argues doctors shouldn’t have to face the expense of complying with new rules or penalties for screwing up. 
""Do they need to go through this much detail to get information to the federal government? I don’t think they do,"" he said. 
We had to know: Do new Medicare billing guidelines include ""nine codes for turkeys""? 
Outdated codes 
First, a little background about this code thing. It’s not just a U.S. system — it’s international. 
(And in case you were wondering, it has nothing to do with Obamacare.) 
The ""new"" set of diagnosis codes that Poe talked about is known as ICD-10. ""ICD"" stands for ""International Classification of Diseases."" It’s published by the World Health Organization, then adapted for use in the United States. 
The United States now uses ICD-9, which is more than three decades old. 
Doctors’ offices use the codes to fill out Medicare and Medicaid claims, among other things. Their billing and practice management software is based on them. Their employees are trained to use them. 
The American Medical Association says that depending on the size of the medical practice, it’ll cost $83,290 to more than $2.7 million to switch. 
Doctors are dealing with so many other expensive regulatory changes, the association has begged since 2011 to delay or give up on the switch altogether. 
Other countries have charged ahead. 
They started to adopt the ""new"" set of codes nearly 20 years ago, and most developed countries now use it, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
CMS will require American doctors, indeed, any organization covered by the 1996 health care law known as HIPAA, to switch by Oct. 1, 2014. 
The federal government says the United States needs to upgrade partly because ICD-9 has outdated medical terms and not enough detail for accurate claims processing. 
Claims for two different injuries might seem like duplicate filings if you couldn’t specify right vs. left hand, for example. 
As Poe suggested, the new system does have far more diagnosis codes than the version developed in the 1970s — 68,000 instead of 13,000. 
(Poe, in his Stossel interview, said the new system has 140,000 codes, but that’s only if you group both diagnosis and procedure codes — not a direct comparison with 13,000.) 
How much detail are we talking? 
The codes allow doctors to specify not just injuries from turkeys, but from parrots, macaws, ducks and geese. 
There’s a different code for being ""struck"" vs. ""pecked"" or suffering from ""other contact""— with specification for the first time, an unlucky repeat or even worse, ""sequela."" (That would be some ""negative afteraffect"" resulting from your turkey encounter. Headaches! Panic attacks!) 
Poe’s office pointed us to this: 
W61.4 Contact with turkey 
W61.42 Struck by turkey 
W61.42XA initial encounter 
W61.42XD subsequent encounter 
W61.42XS sequela 
W61.43 Pecked by turkey 
W61.43XA initial encounter 
W61.43XD subsequent encounter 
W61.43XS sequela 
W61.49 Other contact with turkey 
W61.49XA initial encounter 
W61.49XD subsequent encounter 
W61.49XS sequela 
If you’ve seen TV ads about the need to prepare for a bright new career in medical billing and coding — this is part of the reason why. 
Our ruling 
Poe said doctors face a new regulatory burden, requiring them to use a system that includes nine different codes for turkey injuries. His office pointed us to the new codes, which will be required for Medicare claims by October 2014. Indeed, if your Thanksgiving tradition takes a tragic turn that year, your doctor will be able to describe it in seven-digit detail. (We hope it’s just W61.42XA and not W61.43XS.) We rate his claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEE2540>],/factchecks/2013/apr/30/ted-poe/rep-ted-poe-says-new-medicare-rules-require-nine-b/

John McCain says half of STEM graduate degrees given to foreigners
","
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., recently cited one reason for overhauling the nation’s immigration system: Many of America’s young scientists these days aren’t American, and they need a way to become integrated into the U.S. economy. 
McCain made his case at an April 26, 2013, speech at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce summit titled ""Reforming Immigration for a Better America."" 
""I'll just very briefly mention, if a student graduates from a U.S. college with a science, technology, engineering (or) math degree and has an offer of employment ... they would be eligible to receive a green card to stay in this country"" under the bipartisan legislation McCain supports. ""I'm sure you are aware that over half of the students in the United States of America that are receiving advanced degrees are not citizens of the United States of America. If they want to stay in this country, and they have a job, then we should be able to accommodate for that. It's obviously important for our economy."" 
Is McCain correct that ""over half"" of science, technology, engineering and mathematics students ""receiving advanced degrees"" aren’t U.S. citizens? We didn’t hear back from McCain’s office, but we were able to track down some data ourselves. 
We should begin by pointing out one caveat. The data we found -- statistics compiled by the National Science Foundation’s National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics for 2009 -- divide degree earners into citizens and legal permanent residents on the one hand, and temporary residents (foreign nationals) on the other. So the data doesn't speak directly to McCain's formulation, which refers only to ""citizens."" 
However, since McCain referred to degree earners wanting ""to stay in this country"" -- something that permanent residents, like citizens, wouldn't have to worry about -- it seems reasonable to analyze his comment along the lines described by the NSF data. 
We should also note that there is sometimes a debate about what constitutes degrees in science, technology, engineering and math. PolitiFact Florida, for example, looked at whether anthropology is considered a STEM field and rated the claim that it was Half True. 
In an effort to most closely mirror McCain’s formulation, we looked at all advanced degrees (masters plus doctorates) in the fields of engineering and the natural sciences (which includes mathematics, but excludes the social sciences, such as anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology). 
Using this definition, 37 percent of students earning advanced degrees in 2009 were temporary residents; the rest were U.S. citizens or permanent residents. The percentage of temporary residents is even lower -- 28 percent -- if you include the social sciences, which qualify under the NSF’s ""science"" category. 
Neither figure is over half. 
However, because certain subcategories of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (commonly known as STEM) have higher rates of foreign students, McCain would have been on safer ground if he’d phrased his claim more carefully. 
Here are some statistics for computer- and electronic-related fields: 
• Master’s degrees and doctorates granted for electrical engineering in 2009: 58 percent temporary residents 
• Master’s degrees granted for electrical engineering in 2009: 56 percent temporary residents 
• Doctorates granted in electrical engineering in 2009: 66 percent temporary residents 
• Doctorates granted in computer science in 2009: 54 percent temporary residents 
In general, temporary residents are more dominant in the pool of Ph.D.’s and less dominant in the pool of master’s degree earners: 
• Doctorates granted in all engineering fields in 2009: 57 percent temporary residents 
• Doctorates granted in industrial engineering in 2009: 66 percent temporary residents 
• Doctorates granted in civil engineering in 2009: 61 percent temporary residents 
• Doctorates granted in materials engineering in 2009: 57 percent temporary residents 
• Doctorates granted in chemical engineering in 2009: 53 percent temporary residents 
Meanwhile, the predominance of temporary residents in these fields should remain for a while. Here’s data for current grad students (as of 2009) seeking a master’s or doctorate in STEM fields: 
• Graduate students in all engineering fields in 2009: 55 percent 
• Graduate students in electrical engineering in 2009: 74 percent 
• Graduate students in computer science in 2009: 65 percent 
• Graduate students in industrial engineering in 2009: 61 percent 
• Graduate students in materials engineering in 2009: 54 percent 
• Graduate students in chemical engineering in 2009: 51 percent 
Still, it’s important to remember some context: Doctorates in engineering and computer science account for a distinct minority of all graduate degrees in STEM fields. Once you factor in students seeking master’s degrees as well as students in other STEM subjects -- such as medical science, chemistry and physics -- the overall share of foreign students drops well below 50 percent. 
Our rating 
McCain said that ""over half"" of science, technology, engineering and mathematics students ""receiving advanced degrees are not citizens of the United States of America."" That’s actually incorrect -- the number is no higher than 37 percent. But McCain has a point that temporary residents account for over half of those earning degrees in many economically important fields, such as electrical engineering and computer science. We rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB937280>],/factchecks/2013/apr/30/john-mccain/john-mccain-says-half-stem-graduate-degrees-given-/

Backlog of veterans benefits draws scrutiny
","
More than a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan may have wound down, but policymakers warn the fight has just begun for some veterans. 
They say these warriors’ newest foe is a homegrown threat: bureaucracy at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.   
A backlog of disability claims has forced a growing number of veterans suffering from head trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder and other ailments to wait for months and sometimes more than a year for word of whether the federal government will help them. 
Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Graves of Ranger called the backlog ""immoral"" in a recent op-ed, and he used a stream of factoids to demonstrate how bad the problem has gotten. 
These figures piqued our interest: 
""Despite having their budget increased by over 40 percent since 2009 … pending claims for benefits with the VA have increased from 391,000 to 890,000 under the Obama Administration,"" he said on ZPolitics, a website launched by talk radio host and former congressional candidate Martha Zoller. 
If Graves is correct, the number of pending claims has grown by more than 125 percent. Is this true? And was the agency’s budget hike really this steep, despite the budget-cutting debates of recent years? 
We contacted Graves spokesman John Donnelly for more information. 
The congressman’s criticism is part of a growing chorus of complaints that the VA takes too long to tell veterans whether they’ll receive disability assistance. 
News stories have chronicled cases where veterans died as they waited for an answer. 
Lawmakers are clamoring for action, and VA Secretary Eric Shinseki has vowed to eliminate the backlog by 2015. 
Donnelly responded to PolitiFact Georgia’s request for more information with the VA’s own figures.   
First, let’s look at the VA’s budget. A 10-year overview published on its website showed that in fiscal year 2009, it totaled $97.7 billion. Now it’s $140.3 billion. 
That’s a 43.6 jump, or as Graves said, an increase of ""over 40 percent."" 
Now, let’s consider disability claims. Although the controversy centers on backlogged claims -- defined as those pending more than 125 days -- Graves’ statement concerns ""pending"" claims, those awaiting a disability rating decision by the VA. 
Graves wants veterans to have to wait no more than 30 days for a decision. 
For this portion of our fact check, Donnelly referred us to the VA’s weekly disability claims reports. On Jan. 21, 2009, one day after Obama was sworn into office, the department released a report that said the number of pending cases totaled 391,127. 
The April 8, 2013, report was the most recent one available when Graves submitted his op-ed to ZPolitics, Donnelly said. We found it reported 889,981 pending claims. 
Sure enough, Graves used accurate figures. But did he put them in the correct context? 
Although Graves did not accuse Obama of causing the growth in pending claims, he did mention that the increase took place under the president’s watch. This suggests that the current administration bears at least some responsibility for the problem. We looked to see whether it does.   
We found that the backlog has been a long time coming. The benefits system had been outdated for years before Obama took office. 
When Shinseki, an Obama appointee, took over the department in 2009, it used paper files, not electronic ones. It did not have enough staff to handle the onslaught of veterans returning from a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
""I don't think we really anticipated the nature of injuries, the multiple deployments. Men and women are surviving injuries that would have been sure death 20 or 25 years ago,"" said Dave Autry, a spokesman with DAV, an organization that advocates for disabled American veterans. 
The VA hired more staff and in fiscal 2011 completed 1 million claims, a 6 percent increase from 2009, according to the Government Accountability Office. But the number of claims received grew 29 percent, the GAO reported. 
Veterans advocates told us that even though the VA increased staff, training fell short and claims administrators made bad decisions. Veterans appealed, and the backlog grew even larger. A computerized system intended to streamline the process is still being implemented. 
What’s worse is that to prove they are disabled, veterans have to pull together documents from the Social Security Administration, the Department of Defense and other federal bureaucracies that do not share information, said Paul Rieckhoff, who heads Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, which has been pushing for improvement. 
""What you see is really a bureaucratic failure that stretches across the government,"" Rieckhoff said. ""We don't think it's been a partisan issue."" 
In sum, Graves’ numbers are correct. The VA’s budget has increased by more than 40 percent, and the number of pending claims has skyrocketed from some 391,000 to 890,000 under the Obama administration. 
Graves also was accurate in noting that the increase took place under the president’s watch. While the VA’s benefits system has been troubled since well before Obama took office, efforts during his administration have not prepared the department for its current challenges. 

We rate Graves’ statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECD0ED40>],/factchecks/2013/apr/30/tom-graves/backlog-veterans-benefits-draws-scrutiny/

Austin resident says turnout higher for 1973 city election than the latest mayoral election
","
Austin resident Bee Moorhead, attending a ""civic summit"" hosted by Austin’s KLRU-TV, Channel 18, said in a Twitter message posted from the scene: ""More people voted in 1973 election when Roy Butler was elected mayor than in the most recent Austin mayoral election.""

Did more voters turn out out for the election involving Butler, who served as mayor from 1971 to 1975, than the May 2012 election giving Mayor Lee Leffingwell another term? After all, Austin kaboomed in size and population in the intervening decades.

By phone, Moorhead said her April 23, 2013, tweet echoed a remark by Ryan Robinson, the city’s demographer, during discussion at the summit of voter-adopted plans to elect Austin City Council members from separate districts rather than citywide. Moorhead told us Robinson might even have said that Butler by himself drew more votes in 1973 than Leffingwell got in 2012.

Robinson confirmed his reference to total voter turnout in 1973 and 2012, but told us by phone he did not compare how many votes the mayors drew in the elections nearly four decades apart.

It’s no secret that citizen interest in local elections has been on a downslide. According to a Sept. 13, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article, in the spring of 1971, 57 percent of the city's 93,597 registered voters came to the polls for that year’s mayoral election. In 1981, 38 percent of registered voters turned out for the city’s mayoral election, the story said, with turnout dipping to 23 percent in the 1991 mayoral election, 15 percent in 2003 and 10 percent in the 2012 election that gave Leffingwell a second term.

Given that Moorhead’s claim referred to the voters turning out in 1973 and 2012, we checked city records for precise details. According to one city web page, 63,478 of 151,368 registered voters, 42 percent, turned out for the April 7, 1973 election in which Butler won reelection as mayor. On May 12, 2012, according to another city web page, 49,336 of 461,146 registered voters, 11 percent, participated in the election including Leffingwell’s reelection bid. (Also, Butler drew 43,753 votes, Leffingwell 25,446.)

The city web pages indicate the city’s population nearly tripled in the years in between, rising from 290,300 in 1973 to 824,205 in 2012.

Upshot: There were 14,142 fewer voters in the 2012 city election compared to 1973.

Our ruling

Moorhead tweeted that more Austinites voted in the city’s 1973 election featuring a mayor’s race than in the city’s most recent mayoral election.

Nearly 63,500 voters cast ballots in April 1973. Less than 49,400 participated in May 2012. We rate this claim as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC25140>],/factchecks/2013/apr/30/bee-moorhead/austin-resident-says-turnout-higher-1973-city-elec/

Kirsten Gillibrand says one in five military women, 3 percent of men, have unwanted sexual contact
","
In an interview with MSNBC anchor Andrea Mitchell, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand offered a striking statistic about sexual misconduct in the military. 
""We've had sexual assaults in the military forever,"" Gillibrand said on April 23, 2013, but ""a new report the DOD published found is that one in five ... women are receiving unwanted sexual contact, but also 3.3 percent of men."" 
We wondered if Gillibrand -- who is sponsoring legislation on the matter -- was reporting the numbers accurately. 
The report Gillibrand mentioned is the Health-Related Behaviors Survey of Active Duty Military Personnel from the U.S. Defense Department. (Gillibrand shorthands the agency as the DOD). The study, which samples tens of thousands of members of the military anonymously, is undertaken every three years. The just-released report covers 2011, addressing such issues as alcohol and tobacco use, mental health and other issues. 
The study found that 21.7 percent of women had experienced ""unwanted sexual contact ... since joining the military, by someone in the military."" (It found that 5.8 percent had experienced unwanted sexual contact by a civilian since joining the military.) 
The comparable percentage for men experiencing unwanted sexual contact was 3.3 percent (by a member of the military) and 2.4 percent (by a civilian). 
So Gillibrand has accurately reported the percentages. The only element of her claim that’s slightly misleading is that she referred to service members who ""are receiving unwanted sexual contact."" That makes it sound like they are currently having unwanted contact or had it in the recent past. 
In fact, the statistics refer to unwanted contact that happened ""since joining the military,"" which, for some survey respondents with long tenures in the military, may have been years ago. 
It’s worth noting that the percentages have risen since the 2008 survey. That year, 12.4 percent of women and 2.2 percent of men had experienced unwanted contact. (The 2008 survey did not distinguish between contact by members of the military and civilians.) In addition, only a small fraction of these cases are reported to the authorities, and only some of those proceed to trial. 
The report is unclear about whether the increase from 2008 to 2011 stems from a rise in the number of incidents or fuller reporting of the incidents that do occur. Whatever the reason, the report did say that ""reported rates of unwanted sexual contact, particularly among female service members, warrant attention and action."" 
Our ruling 
Gillibrand said that ""one in five"" women in the military ""are receiving unwanted sexual contact,"" as are ""3.3 percent of men."" Her phrasing is somewhat misleading because her words suggest more recent incidents than the survey indicates. The survey included incidents anytime since the person joined the military. Still, her numbers are correct. We rate her statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB8FB00>],/factchecks/2013/apr/29/kirsten-gillibrand/kirsten-gillibrand-says-one-five-military-women-3-/
"['Georgia', 'Taxes', 'Rob Woodall']","
Rep. overstates popularity of flat tax in ex-Soviet states
","
U.S. Rep. Rob Woodall is passionate about the Fair Tax – a plan to replace the patchwork of federal income taxes with a ""flat"" 23 percent sales tax – so it’s not surprising that it was on his mind when he took to the well of the House earlier this month. 
Woodall introduced a Fair Tax bill in January, after which it was assigned to the House Ways and Means Committee, where it sits today. Woodall wanted to dislodge it. 
The two-term Republican from Lawrenceville calls the Fair Tax a ""plan of hope."" 
""It is a plan to remove the heavy hand of government from your personal pocketbook and put you in charge of your finances and your life,"" he says on his congressional website. 
In his 7,400-word speech, Woodall made his case for ditching our current system for a flat tax. If we did, we’d actually be playing catch-up, Woodall said. 
""I look at what's happened in those former Soviet Bloc countries, Mr. Speaker,"" Woodall said April 16 in a House speech. ""Do you know those former Soviet Bloc countries have all moved to flat taxes?"" 
It is particularly galling to Woodall that the countries of the late Evil Empire have adopted this Reagan-era notion ahead of the United States. That is, of course, if it’s true. 
A small problem with checking Woodall’s claim is his terminology. 
There is the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which is one set of countries, and there’s the Eastern Bloc, which included much of Eastern Europe. ""Soviet Bloc"" is a kind of hybrid of the two, but out of caution, we will assume Woodall was talking about the 15 countries left behind when the USSR dissolved. 
Many of those countries have adopted the flat tax, but five – Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan – have not. 
Woodall declined to elaborate on the speech when PolitiFact contacted his office. His office pointed PolitiFact to a story in The Economist listing the 10 former Soviet republics with flat taxes. 
Daniel Mitchell, a flat tax advocate and senior fellow at the Libertarian Cato Institute, said Woodall was mistaken when he claimed every former Soviet nation had adopted the flat tax, but he said the idea has been ""amazingly pervasive"" in that part of the globe. Mitchell suspects their experiment with communism may be a reason. 
The former Soviet states have been governed by people that are less susceptible to class warfare ideology. That's been a big factor, he said in an email exchange. ""After suffering for decades under communism, there's less sympathy for a redistributionist agenda."" 
That outlook made it easier to embrace a flat income tax, rather than a system that is graduated by income level, Mitchell said. 
Estonia, a country of 1.3 million, was the first of the former Soviet republics to pass a flat tax in 1994, with Lithuania and Latvia close behind. Since then, Russia and six other former Soviet countries have joined suit. 
Mitchell said competition for international investment has been a factor. 
""Among the policy elite, the flat tax was seen as leading to more domestic growth, but I think they mostly saw the flat tax as a shortcut way of attracting capital from the outside,"" he said. ""Sort of a shortcut to more prosperity."" 
The trend is not restricted to the former Soviet states. Some former satellite states have instituted a flat tax and some, such as Slovakia, had it and then scrapped it. 
A final bit of context: Those nations with a flat tax still tax income. Woodall’s Fair Tax would tax sales, which is a different conversation. 
So Woodall was mistaken when he said all ""Soviet Bloc"" countries have embraced the flat tax. Many former communist countries, however, have adopted flat taxes, which was his larger point. 
We rate the congressman’s claim Half True.

Ohio Oil and Gas Association touts 40,000 new Ohio jobs
","
Environmental and economic concerns have been at the center of public discussion about the potential benefits and dangers of horizontal fracturing, or fracking, to release natural gas and oil from deep shale deposits in Ohio. 
The economic benefits, meaning jobs, are the focus of a TV ad that is also posted online by the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, the industry's leading voice in the state. 
""Notice Ohio's economy picking up lately?"" the announcer asks. ""The recent increase in drilling here right here in Ohio has led to adding jobs at a breakneck pace, and jobs are coming in all walks of life. From construction to restaurants to manufacturing, jobs are being created in all sectors of the economy. 
""Fact is, nearly 40,000 new jobs have been created in the last year due to the new wells. That's right -- almost 40,000 new jobs right here in Ohio. Renewing Ohio's heritage."" 
The onscreen text says, ""New jobs,"" ""Real economic growth"" and ""40,000 new jobs."" 
The addition of 40,000 jobs got the attention of PolitiFact Ohio, especially because the state as a whole had a net employment increase of 40,000 in 2012, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
No source for the jobs figure was given with the ad, which we accessed on April 10, so we called the Oil and Gas Association and asked how it was supported. 
They referred us to ""America's New Energy Future,"" a report by the global market information and research company IHS, Inc. 
Given wide coverage when it was released in December 2012, the report was commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Energy Institute, the American Petroleum Institute, the American Chemistry Council, America's Natural Gas Alliance and the Natural Gas Supply Association. 
The report includes state-by-state breakdowns on how many jobs have been created and are projected to 2035 due to shale exploration. It refers to horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing as unconventional drilling. 
""In addition to manufacturing,"" the section on Ohio says, ""gas drilling supports jobs in the transportation, construction and professional, scientific and technical sectors. Currently, unconventional drilling employment supports 38,000 jobs."" 
The multi-state analysis uses a specific figure of 38,830 jobs for Ohio in 2012. It breaks those into three categories. 
It says that 4,200 of the jobs were directly involved in the oil and gas industry, or in ""activities required to explore, produce, transport and deliver products."" 
Another 13,601 were classified as indirectly involved, or employed in activities in outside industries that supply materials and services to the developers. 
The largest number of jobs -- 21,020 -- are identified as ""induced"" jobs. The report says that  ""Induced jobs are those that meet the new demand for consumer goods created by the increased income generated by the direct and indirect jobs,"" or ""workers spending their wages and salaries on consumer goods and household items."" 
The induced and other jobs are broken down in 15 industry categories that include administrative and support services; food services and drinking places; wholesalers, health care, construction, real estate and insurance. 
""All other industries"" account for 11,115 of the induced jobs -- by far, the largest employment category for 2012. 
The source cited for the numbers in the IHS report is IHS Global Insight. IHS told us the direct jobs count came from federally published data, principally the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The remaining 34,000 jobs were the result of standard economic modeling from the published data. 
One of the authors of the IHS report, managing director of economic analysis Mohsen Bonakdarpour, told us that the figures for 2012 could be seen as a snapshot of the average number of jobs, full-time and part-time, supported by oil and gas drilling during the year. 
We also asked about the term ""cross-state contributions,"" found deeper in the report. 
Bonakdarpour said it refers to material or personnel from another state. For example, he said, drillers in Pennsylvania might require equipment available from Oklahoma. The amount of cross-state contribution would be expected to diminish as the industry grows and matures in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio. 
We thought that was pertinent because media reports on shale gas have found a significant number of out-of-state workers, and Gov. John Kasich has said he has ""deep concerns"" that jobs were not going to Ohioans. 
According to the IHS report, the total number of oil and gas jobs in Ohio in 2012, ""excluding cross-state contributions,"" came to 11,569. 
Seeking numbers from another source, we went to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. 
It issued ""Ohio Shale,"" a quarterly report on trends in Ohio oil and gas industries, in February. 
Its shale-related employment report is a lagging survey -- going through the second quarter of 2012 -- because it is a hard count based on a census of employers. 
It shows that employment in core industries and 30 ancillary industries related to shale gas increased by a combined total of 5,628 jobs from the same period in 2011. 
The report notes ""significant churn and turnover in the job market, as demonstrated by the levels of hires and separations."" It says the levels of hires and separations suggest ""a large temporary worker component."" 
A worker is counted only once, however, the quarterly report says, even if the person holds more than one job. But the state cannot determine the residence of workers in the data. 
In a report issued in March, ""Ohio Utica Shale Region Monitor,"" researchers at Cleveland State University's Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs found a spending surge in 2012 but not many new jobs. 
The researchers analyzed total employment for 2011 and 2012 in 13 eastern Ohio counties where shale gas and oil production was underway, and compared the data to the rest of the state. They found that employment growth due to shale development was not evident: employment rose 1.4 percent year-over-year in counties with heavy or moderate shale production, compared to 1.3 percent in other counties without shale development. 
PolitiFact Ohio is not rating either the benefits or drawbacks of drilling. We are checking the statement, from the OOGA ad, that ""nearly 40,000 new jobs have been created in the last year due to the new wells... right here in Ohio."" 
The figure of ""nearly 40,000"" is an accurate reference to the IHS report. And the ad's reference to jobs ""in all walks of life"" does indicate that the jobs net is being cast over a wide area not solely restricted to drilling. 
But the reality and relevance of the number in the context of the ad is undermined considerably by the fact that it is not the result of surveying but of modeling; that fewer than half of its nearly 40,000 jobs are directly or indirectly related to drilling, and that the single largest element -- almost 30 percent of the jobs total -- consists of unidentified ""induced"" jobs. 
We think the ad's reference to the creation of new jobs would reasonably be taken as referring to permanent or continuing jobs, not temporary employment. 
Further, the touting of jobs ""right here in Ohio"" that are ""restoring Ohio's heritage"" is not supported by the substantial percentage of jobs going to out-of-state workers,  even if that percentage is diminishing. 
Finally, the IHS report says its figure of 38,830 jobs refers to total jobs supported by drilling during 2012, not to new jobs created in the year, as the ad claims. 
And the words matter. The IHS report itself makes clear that there is a difference between jobs that are ""created"" by the industry -- which, in a generous reckoning, would encompass direct and indirect jobs -- and jobs that are ""supported,"" which would be all of the 21,020 induced jobs. 
That’s an important distinction that the ad ignores, and it accounts for more than half the jobs that the ad claims. 
So the association has misrepresented its own industry’s study with compounded exaggerations.

"['Economy', 'State Budget', 'Workers', 'Texas', 'Texas State Employees Union']","
Employee group says most state workers did not field a raise from 2009 to 2012
","
Pay raises for Texas government workers are extremely rare of late, an employee group maintains. ""Most state employees did not receive any pay raise from 2009 to 2012,"" the Texas State Employees Union says on a union web page.

On the same page, the union says workers in Texas higher education have not drawn a statewide raise since 2002. But we did not delve into this aspect of government for this article. There is no central repository of pay-raise data for higher education.

We probed instead whether general state agency employees had no raises from 2009 to 2012. Over the three years, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agencies employed about 182,000 workers or more in those years.

By phone, union spokesman Seth Hutchinson said employees last fielded an across-the-board raise in 2008; the 2007 Legislature budgeted consecutive raises of $50 a month or 2 percent, whichever was larger, first in September 2007 and again in September 2008, actions we confirmed in a May 26, 2007, Austin American-Statesman news article.

Hutchinson said the 2009 Legislature gave most employees a one-time $800 bonus, described by some as a retention payment. He said targeted raises were approved for certain employees with law enforcement or prison jobs. According to a June 10, 2009, Statesman news article, correctional workers fielded a 7 percent raise spread over two years and state law enforcement officers fielded raises averaging 7 percent to 8 percent over two years. By phone, Ray Hymel, a lobbyist who represents the Texas Public Employees Association, estimated that more than 34,000 state workers landed these pay raises.

Hutchinson said the revenue-strapped 2011 Legislature did not approve pay raises; we found no news stories contradicting that.

So, there have been no across-the-board increases for state workers since September 2008. In contrast, most workers drew $800 bonuses from the 2009 Legislature, which otherwise awarded raises to a subset of workers.

We wondered how many workers drew increases in pay thanks to merit raises doled out by agency chiefs. Hutchinson replied: ""Many employees never receive merit raises,"" a conclusion he attributed to conversations with union members.

We asked the state comptroller’s office if it could break down merit pay raises from 2009 through 2011. Spokesman R.J. DeSilva emailed us charts indicating the prevalence of three actions leading to higher pay for employees of about 110 agencies, though he said 10 agencies do not enter payroll information with the comptroller’s office in a way that would enable a check of their pay hike.

The comptroller’s research indicates:

--In 2009, 21,996 of 184,754 employees had merit raises, 29,102 workers were promoted and 3,443 workers saw equity pay adjustments.

--In 2010, 13,517 of 187,944 employees fielded merit raises, while 25,489 employees were promoted and 3,826 workers experienced pay adjustments for equity.

--In 2011, 8,860 of 186,549 employees got merit raises, 22,488 workers were promoted and 5,213 saw equity pay increases.

At first pass, this research indicates that in 2009, 30 percent of workers in the checked agencies got a raise in some fashion, while in 2010 and 2011, no more than 23 percent of the workers got a raise. It’s possible, we suppose, that each year, at least 70 percent of workers saw no raise--though that is without considering the law enforcement/criminal justice personnel who fielded legislated raises.

Then again, might it be that different subsets of workers drew merit raises each of the three years so that one might speculate that some 60 percent of workers got a raise sometime in the three years?

Hutchinson suggested another way to break down the comptroller’s results, noting by email that the results could be taken as indicating that just 14 percent of workers fielded merit or equity raises in 2009 and smaller clutches got such raises in 2010 and 2011. His view: It’s not accurate to count promotions as raises considering they involve changes in position and responsibilities with pay implications.

Our ruling

The employees union says most state employees did not receive a raise from 2009 to 2012.

The last across-the-board raises took effect in 2008. Otherwise, lawmakers gave most employees a one-time, one-month bonus in 2009 and legislated consecutive raises for more than 34,000 other workers in 2009 and 2010.

But a bonus is not a raise. Meantime, it appears that no more than 14 percent of workers across most state agencies got a merit raise any of the three years. Even if one assumes, perhaps improbably, that a completely different set of workers got each year’s merit raises, less than half of agency workers would have gotten those pay bumps.

We rate this claim as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE1C9C0>],/factchecks/2013/apr/29/texas-state-employees-union/employee-group-says-most-state-workers-did-not-fie/

Susan B. Anthony List says new Virginia regulations put abortion clinics on par with dental offices
","
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe’s opposition to stricter regulation of abortion  clinics has drawn fire. 
Women Speak Out Virginia, a PAC affiliated with the Susan B. Anthony List that seeks to end abortion, is airing a radio ad that criticizes McAuliffe for opposing what it said are ""common ground abortion center health and safety standards."" 
""McAuliffe refuses to require women’s health clinics to provide the same sanitary environment we expect of dental offices and hospitals,"" the narrator says. 
We were well aware that controversial regulations approved by the Virginia Department of Health on April 12 will require abortion clinics to adhere to the building standards for hospitals. Proponents said the new rules would make abortion clinics safer; opponents said the regulations were a ruse to put the clinics out of business. 
But this is the first time we’ve heard the claim that the rules would require the clinics to provide the same sanitary standards expected of dental offices. So we decided to see if this is the case. 
We asked Mallory Quigley, a spokeswoman for the PAC and the Susan B. Anthony List, for proof of the ad’s claim. She provided no facts. ""We -- meaning Virginia women -- expect a safe, sanitary environment inside abortion clinics, places that should be regulated at least as strict as dental offices and in fact, even stricter -- like hospitals -- which are mentioned immediately after that,"" she wrote in an email. 
The ad implies that prior to the new regulations, abortion clinics were allowed to operate at lower sanitary standards than dental offices. There’s no evidence to support that. They were treated pretty much the same. 
Before the change, neither abortions clinics nor dental offices were regulated by the Virginia Department of Health, according to Erik Bodin, the department’s director of the office of licensure and certification. 
The doctors and dentists were under the purview of the Virginia Department of Health Professions, which licenses medical practitioners. The department only inspected the cleanliness of a physician’s or dentist’s office if there had been a complaint. 
In the case of a dentist’s office, an inspector would be required to fill out a form evaluating the cleanliness of the facility, the disposal of needles, the sterilization of equipment and surfaces. 
The findings are sent to the Board of Dentistry, which can revoke the license of a dentist who endangers public welfare. 
Up until the rule change, abortion clinics were regulated under the general category of ""physician’s offices."" The Board of Medicine does not have specific regulations regarding sanitary standards in a doctor’s office, according to Diane Powers, spokeswoman for the Department of Health Professions. The board looks into complaints and may revoke licenses of physicians who provide ""an unsanitary office environment,"" Powers said. 
So what’s changed under the new regulations? 
Nothing for dental offices. 
But it’s a whole new world for abortion clinics, which now fall under the Department of Health. 
The clinics will have to meet certain building standards for new hospitals regulating the width of hallways, the number of parking spaces, the number of air exchanges used in a procedure room to keep infections from spreading and the type of hand washing sinks used by medical staff. Each clinic is required to have a plan for preventing infections that complies with guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each facility will be inspected by the state Department of Health at least once every two years. 
Our ruling 
A PAC affiliated with the Susan B. Anthony List says in an ad that McAuliffe opposed new regulations that would ""require women’s health clinics to provide the same sanitary environment we expect of dental offices."" 
McAuliffe did oppose new regulations that were approved for abortion clinics earlier this month. But it is ridiculous to imply that these rules elevate the sanitary standards for clinics to those of dental offices. 
Abortion clinics will be held to hospital building codes, must comply with with federal guidelines for infection prevention and will be inspected at least once every two years. Dental offices do not have to meet any of these guidelines and will continue to be inspected only in response to a complaint. 
Without any evidence, the PAC has launched a misleading ad that trivializes very significant and polarizing changes Virginia has made to the way it regulates abortion clinics.

"['Environment', 'Economy', 'Gas Prices', 'Wisconsin', 'Ron Johnson']","
Ron Johnson says recent study showed Wisconsin gas and electricity prices would skyrocket under a cap and trade policy
","
Ron Johnson described believers in man-made causes of climate change as ""crazy"" when he ran for U.S. Senate in 2010, saying that sunspot activity or ""just something in the geologic eons of time"" were more likely explanations for extreme weather. 
Now in his third year in the Senate,  Johnson is markedly more diplomatic when responding to constituents who want him to support limits on greenhouse gas emissions. 
""Thank you for taking the time to contact me regarding cap-and-trade policies and climate change,"" he wrote to Greg Everett, a retired musician from Conover on March 26, 2013.  ""I share your desire to protect our natural environment."" 
Still, Johnson sought to make clear to Everett -- who had signed a petition asking Johnson to support cap and trade -- his continued opposition to government intervention in this realm. 
""But I am equally concerned that misguided efforts to improve the environment can destroy much-needed jobs and new job creation,"" Johnson said in a response that Everett posted on his blog. ""Too often, these policies become so prohibitively expensive that they undermine economic growth and the average American's ability to support himself or herself."" 
Johnson then referred to ""a recent study of a proposed cap-and-trade policy."" 
The study, he wrote, ""showed it would cost Wisconsin nearly 75,000 jobs by 2030 and result in a loss of disposable income of up to $6,900 per household. It could also raise gasoline prices by 141 percent and electricity rates by 171 percent."" 
We’re aware there’s general agreement that cap-and-trade legislation carries a cost for most -- if not all -- consumers. 
But the numbers Johnson cites on gas and electric costs are eye-popping. 
Let’s take a look. 
How cap and trade works 
Generally speaking, cap and trade works like this: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting. 
Companies that find ways to reduce pollution easily and cheaply can end up with extra credits, and sell them to other companies that have trouble reducing their emissions or want to make longer-term investments in conservation, according to a summary by the Environmental Defense Fund. While companies may exchange allowances, the overall limit on pollution remains in place. 
The cap would then be reduced over time to ratchet down greenhouse gas emissions. A lower cap aims to make it more costly for utilities and industries to continue burning fossil fuels. 
When we asked Johnson for backup, a spokesman in his office said the constituent response refers to a 2008 study commissioned by groups concerned about a cap-and-trade bill introduced in the Senate. 
The study does have numbers very close to what Johnson cited -- 141 and 177 percent increases, for gas and oil, solely because of the bill. The study broke out price effects for each state, as well as a national figure. 
But several things jumped out at us about the study. 
In predicting price effects over nearly 25 years, the study presents a range of low and high price-hike estimates, not single figures. The low-cost estimate for gasoline is 72 percent, half of the worst-case estimate. For electricity, the low end increase was 126 percent. 
Johnson mentions only the worst-case scenario, though he did frame it as prices ""could"" jump by the higher figures. 
The study was commissioned by two groups that have opposed legislative efforts on climate change on the same economic grounds that Johnson cites. They are the American Council for Capital Formation (ACCF) and National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). 
It is relatively recent, 2008, but it focused on a bill -- the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act (S. 2191) -- first introduced in 2007. It was replaced by a companion bill in 2008, which died in the Senate. Neither got as much traction as a 2009 bill that passed the House. 
When we broadened our search, we found numerous impact studies by public and private entities on cap-and-trade legislation, and specifically on Lieberman-Warner. 
According to experts, all such efforts at forecasting energy price increases are iffy due to the complexity level. 
The cost projections on Lieberman-Warner are ""at best speculative"" and should be viewed skeptically, warned an exhaustive Congressional Research Service review of six studies. ""It is difficult to project costs up to the year 2030, much less beyond. The already tenuous assumption that regulatory standards will remain constant becomes more unrealistic, and other unforeseen events loom as critical issues which cannot be modeled."" 
Fuel price estimates, in particular, vary widely depending on various assumptions made by researchers, the review said. 
And the study for the manufacturing group -- cited by Johnson -- showed dramatically higher increases in gasoline prices than predicted in studies by two government agencies and a non-profit that supports cap and trade, the research service found. 
Gasoline: The Johnson-cited study projected hikes of $1.70 to $3.25 per gallon by 2030, while the federal government’s official source of energy statistics, the Energy Information Administration (EIA), predicted increases of 40 cents per gallon. The non-profit Clean Air Task Force put the hike at 25 cents. The figures compared are national, not specific to Wisconsin. 
Electricity: The Johnson-cited study predicted increases at least twice as high as studies by EIA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Task Force, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the National Mining Association. Again, the figures are national. 
The CRS specifically warned about breaking down cost impacts state by state -- as the manufacturers study did -- saying: ""Simple attempts by some presentations to break down the cost by industrial sector or by state should be viewed with attentive skepticism."" 
Overall, the service found, ""the more comprehensive analyses are the work by EPA, EIA, and MIT."" 
Another bill, another study 
The two groups behind the study Johnson relied on also did a separate projection of the Wisconsin energy cost impact of a more recent bill -- the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 sponsored by U.S. Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey. 
The Waxman-Markey bill, unlike Lieberman-Warner,  passed the House 219-212 on June 26, 2009. It did not get a Senate vote. Its impact was studied in 2009. 
In that study, the two groups projected much smaller price increases from Waxman-Markey (19.9 percent to 26.1 percent for gas, and 37.5 percent to 59.7 percent for electric)than from the bill Johnson chose to highlight (increases well over 100 percent). 
That’s likely because Waxman-Markey rolled some of the revenue from pollution permits back to consumers in the form of rebates or expanded efficiency programs. 
Johnson spokesman Brian Faughnan told us Johnson’s climate change letter was simply an attempt to show the reasonable possible impact of major legislation that started in the Senate, the chamber where he serves. 
""Senator Johnson’s letter does not claim to give a full range of the estimates of the impact of cap and trade,"" Faughnan wrote in an email to us. 
And in any event, the two studies by the manufacturers show major increases in gas prices, and significantly greater electricity costs, Faughnan wrote. 
Our rating 
Experts agree that cap and trade likely means higher energy costs for consumers. 
Johnson goes further, saying it would be ""prohibitively expensive."" He tells constituents he opposes it in part because a ""recent study"" showed it could ""raise gasoline prices by 141 percent and electricity rates by 171 percent."" 
There is a study that includes those estimates for Wisconsin. 
But Johnson ignores critical facts. The same study cites much smaller increases under a second scenario. And its conclusions, published by opponents of the bill, are an outlier among several other studies that independent congressional researchers say were more thorough -- and show much smaller increases. He also ignores studies that said a more recent bill dramatically held down the size of cost increases to consumers. 
In an area in which precise conclusions are difficult, Johnson cherry-picks one study of a dead bill and presents its worst-case scenario as hard evidence of ""prohibitively expensive"" effects of a cap and trade approach. 
We rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB843880>],/factchecks/2013/apr/28/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-says-recent-study-showed-wisconsin-gas/
"['New Jersey', 'Debt', 'State Budget', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie claims he entered office with a deficit in the billions left by Barbara Buono, Jon Corzine
","
Some claims just never get old for Gov. Chris Christie. 
Take, for example, the existence of billions of dollars in deficits that awaited the new governor in January 2010, which he has now referenced at least five times. Christie described the burden during the ""Ask The Governor"" radio program that aired Monday on NJ101.5 FM. 
""If anyone should know irresponsible it should be Senator Buono. She’s the one, her budget left us with a $2 billion budget deficit in fiscal 10 that I had to fix. Her mistakes. And for fiscal year 2011 an $11 billion budget deficit. Her mistakes, along with her partner Jon Corzine."" 
One legislator - who happens to be running against Christie in November's gubernatorial contest - and one predecessor solely responsible for billions in debt? Nice try, governor, but not entirely accurate. 
Let’s begin by explaining the budget process. 
New Jersey operates on a fiscal year beginning July 1 and ending the following June 30. The governor presents a budget, the Legislature reviews it, and the public and nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services offer input. The governor has final approval of the plan and must sign it by July 1. 
Buono chaired the state Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee and Jon Corzine was governor when the budgets in question were crafted. 
Now let’s look at both deficits. 
The first deficit was a $2.2 billion shortfall that existed when Christie took office on Jan. 19, 2010, more than halfway through the fiscal 2010 budget year. Christie fixed it by cutting more than 300 line items in the budget, including $475 million in school aid. 
The $11 billion deficit was actually a $10.7 billion structural deficit that the OLS projected for the fiscal 2011 budget year. 
A structural deficit measures how much money the state would need if current services and revenues remained the same, and all required funding obligations are fulfilled. 
But governors don’t have to keep state spending the same as it ever was. They can change services and approve a spending plan that doesn’t meet funding requirements. That’s what Christie did in the case of the $11 billion deficit: he didn’t fully fund the property tax rebate program or the school-aid formula, and he skipped a more than $3 billion payment into the state’s pension funds. 
Christie then dismissed structural deficits as ""the old way of budgeting,"" and said New Jersey had switched to zero-based budgeting. Doing so made the $11 billion deficit ‘disappear,’ but the OLS still tracks such debt. Indeed, Christie’s $32.9 billion budget proposal for fiscal year 2014 contains a $3 billion structural deficit. 
It’s not unusual for governors to not fully fund required or expected costs, according to Raphael Caprio, a professor of Public Administration in the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. The pension fund is one example, he noted. 
So are Buono and Corzine at fault? 
""It is true when Christie came into office there was a roughly two billion dollar shortfall that needed to be corrected for during the current budget year and most of the budget year was under the bridge, and so the problem was exacerbated,"" Caprio said. ""It probably was the result of multiple factors created from a perfect storm: we were still in recession, it was an election year, the previous administration probably should have paid closer attention, but it was what it was. 
  
""I think it’s probably a little over the top to say that Senator Buono was responsible for the $2 billion shortfall,"" he added. 
But Kevin Roberts, a Christie spokesman, said in an e-mail that Buono has frequently taken credit for the budgets in question, ""saying her time as budget chair ‘speaks for itself.’"" 
""We couldn't agree more,"" he said. ""As budget chair and architect of Jon Corzine's budgets, Buono has openly and admittedly taken responsible for the policies that were so irresponsibly crafted, they blew a $2.2 billion hole in New Jersey’s deficit that fell to Governor Christie to fix."" 
Buono for Governor spokesman David Turner said Christie is trying to deflect blame for his own ""fiscally irresponsible budget gimmicks."" 
""During a time when more than 400,000 people are looking for work, he has raided programs that would create jobs, underfunded our schools and delayed property tax relief for working and middle class families,"" Turner said in an e-mail. 
  
Our ruling 
Christie said, ""If anyone should know irresponsible it should be Senator Buono. She’s the one, her budget left us with a $2 billion budget deficit in fiscal 10 that I had to fix. Her mistakes. And for fiscal year 2011 an $11 billion budget deficit. Her mistakes, along with her partner Jon Corzine."" 
Although the budget is the chief responsibility of the governor, many are responsible for negotiating the document that ultimately becomes the state’s spending blueprint, Caprio said. Buono chaired the senate budget panel for the budgets referenced by Christie, but neither she nor Corzine are completely responsible for the deficits. Many factors were at play. We rate Christie's claim Half True.

U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse: Narragansett Bay in R.I. has gotten 4 degrees warmer since the 1960s
","Want evidence of man-made climate change? U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse says you can feel it in the waters of Narragansett Bay, which covers about 120.5 square miles, from Newport to Providence, in his home state of Rhode Island. ""Narragansett Bay waters are getting warmer -- 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in the winter since the 1960s,"" he said April 9 during one of his regular climate speeches on the floor of the Senate. He blamed the warmer temperatures for a drop in the flounder catch from more than 2,500 metric tons in the 1980s to about 150 metric tons in 2009. The reason: Warmer temperatures attract winter flounder predators earlier in the season. We can save the winter flounder factoid for another day. We were interested in whether Bay water has, in fact, gotten 4 degrees warmer since the 1960s, especially when water temperatures can fluctuate naturally from year to year. Whitehouse's office directed us to a 2008 article written by researchers at the University of Rhode Island’s Graduate School of Oceanography and published in the journal Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science. It says that the surface water of the Bay from December through February ""has warmed on average by about 2.2 degrees Celsius since 1960."" That would be 4 degrees Fahrenheit. An accompanying chart showing the trend ends at 2006. We wondered whether the increase continued beyond that. Next we contacted Jeremy Collie, a URI oceanographer. ""There's clearly a warming signal,"" he said as he looked at the trend line for data from 1959 through 2010. ""If you look at the winter months and take a regression, you get a warming rate of about 0.5 degrees F. per decade."" That would be about 2.5 degrees F. since 1960. ""So 4 degrees is a little on the high end,"" he  said. He cautioned that there can be a lot of normal variation in the readings from winter to winter. The data, collected off Fox Island, located between North Kingstown and the Jamestown Bridge, can be downloaded from URI's website (search for ""fox island 1959-2010""). We double-checked the trend, using Microsoft Excel's ability to create a chart, and found an increase, of 2.4 degrees for December-February from 1959-2010. (It rose to 2.7 degrees if you didn't include the winter of 1959-60, which might not be considered to be in the 1960s.) We also checked the data for another temperature measuring site: Whale Rock, south of the bridge on the same side of the Bay. Using data from December 1960 through February 2010, we again found an increase of 2.7 degrees F. In both locations, temperatures deeper in the water rose a bit more -- about 3 degrees -- but still not by the amount the senator said. It's unclear why the older study reported a surface temperature 1.5 degrees higher than our newer look at the data. The 2008 article appears to be using the same data we did. The additional winters we looked at had some colder-than-normal temperatures but that doesn't seem to be enough to account for the difference. Our ruling When Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said ""Narragansett Bay waters are getting warmer -- 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in the winter since the 1960s,"" he was citing a URI study that offered the observation after authors examined temperatures through 2006. The latest data for December, January and February -- the months used in the URI study -- extending through 2010 reveal that the increase since the '60s is less extreme. The closest we saw was a 3-degree rise in the deeper waters off Fox Island. The trend is certainly correct, but Whitehouse is too far off for the Truth-O-Meter to register True. It is, to pardon the pun, a matter of degree. Because the temperature rise is a little more than half of what he said, we rate his statement Half True.

"['Alcohol', 'Oregon', 'Economy', 'Mark Johnson']","
Is there a craft brewery in every legislative district in Oregon?
","
The Oregon House voted recently to designate brewer’s yeast as the state microbe. 
House Concurrent Resolution 12, which honors Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is now in the hands of the Senate after receiving unanimous support in the House. Before it passed, resolution sponsor Rep. Mark Johnson, R-Hood River, hammered home the economic importance of craft breweries to Oregon. 
""Designating Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or brewer’s yeast, as the official microbe of the state of Oregon is an important recognition of the impact this little microbe has had on our state’s economy and on our culture,"" Johnson said. 
""Every legislative district in the state has at least one craft brewery and countless home brewers."" 
All that craft brewery talk made PolitiFact Oregon feel rather parched. Had Johnson just mapped out a summer road trip for us to quench our thirst (for knowledge of Oregon political geography, of course)? Is there really at least one craft brewery in every legislative district in the state? 
    
Johnson’s office provided us with a list of breweries by Senate and House district. Every Senate district contains two House districts; we wanted to ensure at least one craft brewing facility exists in each of the 60 House districts. 
    
Johnson’s legislative aide, Rainier Butler, said it appeared that every district contained a craft brewery except House District 17, which covers Stayton, Lebanon and Scio. 
To double check Johnson’s data, we visited the Oregon Liquor Control Commission website and downloaded a spreadsheet of the more than 15,000 alcohol licenses issued by the state. We narrowed the list to the 222 facilities that had active brewery and brewery-public house licenses. These are facilities that make malt beverages and then sell them primarily at wholesale or retail. 
Mark Friesen, an online producer at The Oregonian, geocoded and mapped the 222 facilities by legislative district. 
The results confirmed that House District 17 lacks a licensed brewery, as does House District 47, which covers a large portion of East Portland, and House District 4, which covers Central Point, White City and Eagle Point. 
We checked with the offices of Rep. Dennis Richardson, a Central Point Republican who represents District 4; Rep. Sherrie Sprenger, a Scio Republican who represents District 17; and Jessica Vega Pederson, a Portland Democrat who represents District 47, to see if they knew of any craft brewing facilities in their districts. They did not, though their staff said it was not the type of information they kept close tabs on. 
We should also note that businesses constantly open and close, so perhaps a craft brewery in those districts recently closed unbeknownst to us or is slated to open soon. 
However, our map of OLCC licensed breweries also indicated that two more districts — 28 in Beaverton and Aloha, and 40 in Oregon City and Gladstone — lack craft breweries. 
Johnson’s office said those districts include a branch of McMenamins, which they believe count as craft breweries even if they don’t brew their own beer on site. 
We’re not sure we buy that. If they don’t brew their own beer on site, they’re just like any other bar serving beer brewed elsewhere. 
McMenamins does have one pub in each of those two districts, but company spokeswoman Renee Rank confirmed for us that the Beaverton and Oregon City pubs do not brew beer on site. The beer is brought in from other nearby breweries, she said. 
Lastly, we shared our findings with Brian Butenschoen, executive director of the Oregon Brewers Guild, which represents 103 brewing companies. He couldn’t think of any craft breweries in House Districts 4, 17 or 47, though all the other districts have at least one. 
""It’s pretty close, but I don’t think every single one does,"" he said. 
We asked him if a McMenamins pub that served beer brewed off-site would count in his book as a craft brewery. 
""It’s not a super-important distinction to most folks,"" he said. ""Would I count that in my list of breweries? No."" 
Our investigation found that districts 4, 17 and 47 do not have craft breweries. We’re also skeptical that a McMenamins pub that doesn’t brew on site qualifies as a craft brewery. 
""The vast majority of Oregon does have access to quality craft brewery products,"" Johnson said after we shared our findings. ""The craft-brewing industry is incredibly fast growing. It continues to be a bright spot in the midst of an otherwise slow economy."" 
Even if we exclude the two districts with McMenamins pubs, more than 90 percent of House and Senate districts in Oregon have at least one craft brewery. If Johnson had hedged his statement a bit and said that ""nearly"" every legislative district in the state has at least one craft brewery, this would be a True. 
But that’s not what he said. Johnson said in his floor speech that every legislative district in the state has at least one craft brewery. 
We rate this statement False — and hope to see you out on the beer trail soon to toast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEA47C0>],/factchecks/2013/apr/27/mark-johnson/there-craft-brewery-every-legislative-district-ore/

Mike McCabe says Minnesota is imprisoning half as many people as Wisconsin, with same crime rates
","As this year’s governor race takes off, Republican Gov. Scott Walker has made crime and state prisons a hot topic. In an Aug. 7, 2018 tweet -- a week ahead of the primary election -- Walker claimed Democrats in the race wanted to cut the state prison population in half, which would ""require the release of thousands of violent felons."" We rated the claim Half True. The main problem: While a short time frame might require that, a longer time frame  — and reducing incoming inmates as well as releasing some others — would not. What’s more, not every one of the Democrats made the 50 percent reduction a promise. (Tony Evers, Walker’s opponent in November, has said cutting the inmate population by half is ""a goal that’s worth accomplishing."") As we cleaned out our files after the Aug. 14 primary, we came across an interesting claim we didn’t get to that remains relevant. It was from Mike McCabe, who was at the time running in a wide field of Democrats vying to replace Walker. He’s a former executive director of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign and founder of the the activist group Blue Jean Nation. In a July 6, 2018 interview on Wisconsin Public Television’s ""Here & Now,"" McCabe stated that Minnesota is ""imprisoning half as many people as Wisconsin, and yet our states have virtually identical crime rates."" Is he right? Prison populations When asked to provide backup for his claim, McCabe pointed to 2016 U.S. Department of Justice data compiled into a map by The Sentencing Project, a research and advocacy center that aims to reduce incarceration nationwide. According to the data, 22,144 people were imprisoned in the state of Wisconsin, while 10,592 were imprisoned in Minnesota. That puts Minnesota’s prison population at 47.8 percent of Wisconsin’s -- not quite at half, as McCabe said. Since the states differ in size, the prison rate provides a better perspective. According to the justice department’s 2015 data, Minnesota has one of the lowest rates in the country -- 196 prisoners per 100,000 people. Wisconsin’s rate is 377 prisoners per 100,000, or nearly twice that of Minnesota. Crime rates As for the state crime rates, McCabe pointed to FBI statistics from 2016 that showed Minnesota with a rate 2,376 crimes per 100,000 residents. That is slightly higher than Wisconsin’s crime rate, which was 2,239 crimes per 100,000 residents. But it’s not quite that simple. According to Michael Tonry, director of the Institute on Crime and Public Policy at the University of Minnesota, prison rate comparisons are more reliable than crime rate comparisons. That’s because prison data is all kept by the state. Crime data, in contrast, is kept and reported by local police departments, then transmitted to the state and sent to the FBI. And, though the FBI provides definitions on how to classify various crimes, in practice it can vary widely among local law enforcement agencies. Still, Tonry said if crime rates are within 20 to 25 percent, they are ""for all practical purposes, the same."" This would also support McCabe’s claim. Probation All of that said, there is something else to consider: In making the comparison, is McCabe missing the bigger picture? For instance, Minnesota ranks in the top five states for people on probation. As of 2015, Minnesota had a rate of 2,328 per 100,000 people, versus Wisconsin’s 1,028 per 100,000. So, more than double Wisconsin by that measure. In fact, if one examines all forms of correctional supervision -- which includes those in prison, jail, probation and supervised release -- it provides some more insight into what is really going on between the two states. Minnesota had 2,210 per 100,000 residents in some form of correctional control, according to 2015 U.S. Bureau of Justice statistics. That placed it in a tie for 14th place with Alabama. Meanwhile, Wisconsin was somewhat lower -- 1,740 per 100,000 residents, tied for 25th place with Missouri and Maryland. Policy differences Whether it is more effective to put more criminals in prison or to put them on probation is a near constant debate between Republicans and Democrats. The reason Minnesota imprisons fewer people, according to Kenneth Streit, a clinical professor of law emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is because Minnesota saw in the 1970s how its prison population was projected to increase. The state established a bipartisan sentencing guidelines commission to prioritize how to use the existing prison beds. While the state did eventually have to build more beds when crime spiked in the 1980s and 90s, Streit said it was at a ""far lower rate"" than in Wisconsin. In addition, Streit said Minnesota’s sentencing guidelines, which are mandatory, offer ""very, very limited"" instances where sentences can be consecutive. In Wisconsin, sentencing guidelines are advisory, Streit said, so consecutive sentences are more common. Streit said he believes, to that degree, McCabe has ""identified a major difference"" between Minnesota and Wisconsin. Our rating McCabe stated that Minnesota is ""imprisoning half as many people as Wisconsin, and yet our states have virtually identical crime rates."" Minnesota and Wisconsin have nearly identical crime rates, and Minnesota does indeed imprison about half the amount of people as Wisconsin. McCabe’s claim, though, misses some important information: That is, Minnesota has a higher overall ""correctional control rate,"" which provides more insight into how the states really compare. We rate McCabe’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE3EFC0>],/factchecks/2018/sep/05/mike-mccabe/mike-mccabe-says-minnesota-imprisoning-half-many-p/

Fact-checking Donald Trump's tweet that Collins, Hunter indictments stem from Obama era
","President Donald Trump attacked his attorney general on Twitter, blaming the nation’s top lawyer for bringing charges against two Republican lawmakers ahead of the midterm elections. Trump claimed the investigations, which culminated recently in a pair of federal indictments, began during the presidency of his predecessor Barack Obama. ""Two long running, Obama era, investigations of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department,"" Trump tweeted. ""Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff.""  Two long running, Obama era, investigations of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department. Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff...... Trump did not identify the lawmakers by name. He didn’t have to. In the past several weeks, the department has issued indictments against Republican Reps. Chris Collins of New York and Duncan Hunter of California. The two men were among Trump’s earliest supporters on Capitol Hill during the 2016 campaign. Trump’s tweet has been criticized as an attack on both the rule of law, as well as the Justice Department’s generally apolitical posture. Here, we’re interested in whether the recent indictments stem from investigations that began under Obama, as Trump claimed. (We’re not examining the popularity of the congressmen in question.) The Justice Department does not typically confirm the timeline of grand juries, and the department declined our request for comment on this story. Our research is limited to the indictments themselves, as well as public reporting. So far, the available evidence suggests one investigation began during Trump’s presidency. The timing of other is less clear. All public evidence suggests Collins’ investigation began under Trump, not Obama. What’s more, the charges he faces stem from a phone call made in June 2017, months after Trump took office and his pick to lead the Justice Department, Sessions, was confirmed. Collins is accused of insider trading. The charges stem from a phone call he made to his son Cameron to relay closely-held details about an Australian biotech company. Both men held stock in the firm. As a board member of the company, Innate Immunotherapeutic, Chris Collins learned — before it was publicly known — that the company had failed a pivotal drug trial. Had the drug passed the test, it would have offered a lucrative treatment for a certain form of multiple sclerosis. Instead, the public announcement of the negative results caused the stock price to plummet by 92 percent. But before the results became public, Collins called his son, a shareholder, so that he could dump the stock, the indictment says. Timely trades by the father and son, along with a third defendant, allowed them to avoid losses totaling more than $768,000. That phone call took place in June 2017 — months after Trump succeeded Obama. The defendants were indicted Aug. 8 in the Southern District of New York. All three pleaded not guilty. Preet Bharara, who served as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 2009 to 2017, until he was fired by Trump, would almost certainly know if the Collins investigation started under the previous administration. ""Chris Collins was not an Obama era investigation,"" Bharara tweeted in response to Trump.  Chris Collins was not an Obama era investigation. FYI. https://t.co/IQqdpTvS60 The start date of Hunter’s investigation is a bit trickier. Hunter and his wife have been charged with misusing $250,000 in campaign funds to finance personal expenses like family trips. The couple also is alleged to have filed false campaign finance records. Hunter’s behavior generated some attention prior to Trump taking the White House. The Office of Congressional Ethics, a government watchdog established by the U.S. House of Representatives, asked the House Committee on Ethics to look into allegations about Hunter in August 2016. Some of the misconduct he’s since been indicted for also predates the 2016 election. That said, the first news reports that Hunter was under criminal investigation appear to have surfaced in March 2017, during Trump’s presidency. ""The Hunter one has probably been pending longer (than the Collins investigation),"" said Lisa Kern Griffin, a law professor at Duke University. ""Though it’s hard to say whether DOJ ‘opened’ it before or after the election or transition."" Hunter’s charges indicate they were issued by a ""September 2016 Grand Jury."" So is that when the grand jury began investigating Hunter’s case? Not necessarily, say legal experts. ""A grand jury usually will work on a lot of matters, and even if this grand jury started in September 2016, it might have been working on other things until the last several months,"" said Andrew Leipold, a law professor at University of Illinois College of Law. In other words, it’s possible the grand jury began working on Hunter’s case after the election. ""You just can’t tell from the indictment,"" Leipold said. Trump said the investigations of two Republican congressmen began under Obama. The jumping-off point for the Collins insider-trading investigation was a phone call that began months after Obama left office. The start date of Hunter’s investigation is a bit trickier. A congressional watchdog looked into campaign finance allegations prior to Trump’s presidency, and some of the misconduct he’s since been indicted for also predates the 2016 presidential election. But the first public reports that Hunter was under criminal investigation appear to have surfaced in March 2017, during Trump’s presidency. We rate this Mostly False.

GOP U.S. Senate candidate Vukmir refreshes claim about 2011 Capitol 'riots'
","In her battle against U.S. Sen Tammy Baldwin, Republican Leah Vukmir is presenting herself as a tried, true and tested conservative. That approach was evident in the primary battle, in which Vukmir, a state senator from Brookfield, defeated U.S. Marine veteran and businessman Kevin Nicholson. During a July 26, 2018 primary debate, Vukmir stressed that Wisconsin Republicans have ""moved the conservative ball down the field. We are not establishment Republicans in Wisconsin; we are activist Republicans."" Vukmir then pitched herself as ""a strong leader with a track record who’s not going to buckle"" and cited the 2011 battle over Act 10 declaring: ""I have been through the gauntlet, when we had riots in that Capitol."" Erm? What? The background The 2011 protests against what would become Act 10 turned into a round-the-clock occupation of the Capitol, with demonstrators camping out in the rotunda. It was the largest series of protests at the Capitol since the Vietnam War, with crowds reaching an estimated 100,000 in early March, after the bill had been signed by newly-elected Gov. Scott Walker. The protests were over a push by Walker and Republicans in the Legislature to dramatically curtail collective bargaining for most public employees. The move allowed the state and other units of government to require a higher share of pension and health care costs be paid by workers, which Walker and the GOP said was needed to close a state budget gap. The protests -- and the fact Senate Democrats fled to Illinois to delay a vote -- drew major news coverage for weeks. The tumult even attracted international attention, with Piotr Duda, president of the 700,000-member Polish trade union Solidarity, releasing a statement in support of the Wisconsin protesters. Meanwhile, Ian’s Pizza shops delivered hundreds of free pizzas to the Capitol, with the cost picked up by contributions from all 50 states — as well as Bosnia, China, Egypt, France and 20 other countries. But pizza deliveries in a riot zone? A similar claim Mattias Gugel, communications director for Vukmir’s Senate campaign, did not respond to our requests for back up for Vukmir’s claim. This is not the first time we heard, and evaluated, a ""riot"" claim. Appearing on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" program the morning of Feb. 17, 2011, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., defended Walker’s efforts. ""It's not asking a lot, it's still about half of what private sector pensions do and health care packages do,"" Ryan said. ""So (Walker’s) basically saying, I want you public workers to pay half of what our private sector counterparts (pay) and he's getting riots -- it's like Cairo has moved to Madison these days."" At the time, protests had also swept through the Middle East. In Egypt, 18 days of protests led to the  Feb. 11, 2011, resignation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Our rating of Ryan’s riot claim: Pants on Fire. Numerous law enforcement agencies handled the protests, including the Dane County Sheriff’s Department, Madison police, state Department of Natural Resources and Capitol police. But only a handful of arrests were reported. ""For the most part, people have been very respectful and very orderly,"" a public information officer for the Dane County Sheriff’s Department told us at the time. ""It certainly has been a very peaceful protest."" To be sure, there were threats made against Walker and GOP lawmakers. In his book ""Unintimidated,"" Walker wrote that he received letters targeting his family and faced death threats and frightening encounters with protesters. There were also reports of threats being made against several lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald. But that’s different than riots. At the time, Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said of Ryan’s ""riot"" statement: ""It’s astounding that he would say that. It’s so spectacularly wrong."" Ryan himself admitted: ""It was an inaccurate comparison."" Our rating During a campaign debate, Vukmir said: ""I have been through the gauntlet, when we had riots in that Capitol."" That vastly overstates what happened, in an effort to burnish her own stand-tough persona for voters. The claim of ""riots"" in the Capitol was debunked in 2011 and rarely, if ever, has come up since. That is, until Vukmir put herself on the hot seat by recycling the claim.

"['Taxes', 'Illinois', 'JB Pritzker']","
Pritzker claims Rauner misquoted newspapers to lie about him. That’s a stretch.
","It’s a common tactic for campaign advertising to highlight selective snippets from newspapers and other media in an attempt to pump an air of credibility into claims and attacks. That time-worn formula is at the center of a recent TV ad by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner that quotes from several papers about Democratic challenger J.B. Pritzker, including one from Rockford that declares ""the main thing Pritzker wants to do is raise taxes."" Now Pritzker is punching back with his own TV ad that accuses Rauner of distorting the quotes he is appropriating. ""When you’re a failure, you lie,"" a narrator says in the Pritzker spot. ""Bruce Rauner is intentionally misquoting newspapers to lie about J.B. Pritzker."" The dueling ads go down a rabbit hole of election-year politics where there’s now an argument about the argument. Rauner’s ad clearly takes liberties in seeking to paint Pritzker with a broad brush as an advocate of sweeping tax hikes. But Pritzker claims Rauner goes far beyond that by straying into outright fabrication. That’s a provocative charge that invites a closer look. ""The main thing Pritzker wants to do is raise taxes,"" the first quotation in Rauner’s ad reads, attributed to the Rockford Register Star. ""An immediate increase in the current 4.95 percent flat tax rate,"" the second line goes on, this time from the Champaign News-Gazette. ""A short-term plan and a long-term plan to increase income taxes,"" the next line reads, also from the News-Gazette. Seven quotations later, the ad concludes with its sole original line: ""J.B. Pritzker and Mike Madigan. Higher taxes. More corruption."" We checked the entire string of cited articles and located the quoted lines in all of them. So it’s clear Rauner isn’t pulling words out of thin air. When we asked Pritzker’s campaign to explain how Rauner erred, spokesman Jason Rubin wrote in an email that the ad ""misquotes articles by repeating lines out of context and in a way that misrepresents J.B.’s vision for putting Illinois back on track."" For support, Rubin pointed to passages in some of the same articles cited by Rauner that nod to Pritzker’s very different view of his tax stance. Pritzker has said, and the articles point out, that he wants to amend the Illinois Constitution so the state’s current flat-rate income tax can be replaced with a graduated income tax allowing for higher rates on the wealthy — how much, he won’t say. Any such effort would take several years to accomplish, so in the interim Pritzker also says he would raise the current 4.95 percent flat-tax rate but offset the increased cost for low and middle-income taxpayers with expanded exemptions and deductions. It’s a complicated scenario, and Rauner’s ad ignores all the nuance by suggesting Pritzker seeks to raise taxes across the board. That said, the Rauner ad is packed with sweeping condemnations of Pritzker’s tax plan — among them that it ""would punish many Illinoisans"" — ripped accurately from editorials that unambiguously criticize the Democrat. As we’ve pointed out before, implementing a graduated income tax would not necessarily mean raising taxes on the middle class, despite what Rauner and some of his editorial sources contend. But that doesn’t mean the governor is inaccurately quoting others who make that argument. Pritzker would be on firmer ground had he merely accused Rauner of taking liberties. But there’s a big difference between strategically selecting advantageous lines and putting words in someone’s mouth. And if Pritzker is going to call Rauner out for cherry-picking, it’s also relevant to note that Pritzker does the same in his own response ad. It takes Rauner to task for failing to point out that a Rockford Register Star opinion column he references also mentions Pritzker’s argument that he ""only wants to raise taxes on wealthy people."" But the overall tenor of the Rockford piece clearly takes a skeptical view of Pritzker’s tax plan, likely why Rauner chose to highlight it in the first place. Kent Redfield, a state campaign expert at the University of Illinois’ Institute of Government & Public Affairs, called ""misquoting"" a poor word choice on Pritzker’s part. ""It isn’t that Rauner has lied,"" Redfield said. ""One isn’t misquoting and the other quoting accurately. They’re both selectively choosing things that reinforce and lend journalistic credibility to their argument."" Pritzker’s ad says Rauner ""is misquoting newspapers"" to lie about him. Rauner’s ad selectively quotes from newspapers — mostly editorials — to reinforce a disputed narrative that Pritzker is out to broadly hike taxes on Illinoisans. In doing so, Rauner leaves out a key point acknowledged in the articles that his ad cites: Pritzker says he only wants to raise taxes on wealthier individuals. The Democrat’s campaign argues this means Rauner’s ad is ""misquoting"" those articles by taking them out of context. But most of the ad’s driving excerpts come from editorials or opinion columns that share Rauner’s dim view of Pritzker’s tax policies. The position advanced by Rauner’s ad clearly matches the harsher editorials that frame it. While Pritzker’s statement contains an element of truth, it ignores this critical fact. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB35040>],/factchecks/2018/sep/02/jb-pritzker/pritzker-claims-rauner-misquoted-newspapers-lie-ab/
"['New York', 'Marijuana', 'Nate McMurray']","
McMurray advocates for marijuana legalization
","Nathan McMurray, a Democrat running in New York’s 27th Congressional District in Western New York, supports legalizing marijuana. He says doing so can help alleviate opioid addiction and financially benefit rural areas. ""Evidence is mounting that marijuana legalization reduces opioid addiction numbers,"" it says on McMurray's campaign website. The Grand Island town supervisor has called for an end to the ""failed war on drugs"" by passing federal legislation that legalizes cannabis products. McMurray said he supports the Marijuana Justice Act bills (H.R. 4815 / S. 1689) that are currently in U.S. House and Senate committees. The proposed legislation would remove cannabis from the Federal Controlled Substances Act, and expunge federal marijuana use and possession crimes. McMurray says the legalization and taxation of cannabis in farming districts like NY-27 can benefit the local economy and generate tax revenues for the treatment of serious addictions. There is no way to know if lawmakers would use the tax revenue for opioid addiction treatment.  But would legalizing marijuana reduce opioid addiction? Several studies have examined a possible link between marijuana legalization and opioid use. The outcomes were mixed. An October 2014 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that ""states with medical cannabis laws had a 24.8 percent lower mean annual opioid overdose rate compared with states without medical cannabis laws."" Medical marijuana laws reduced opioid overdose deaths over time, according to the study, which studied medical cannabis laws and opioid overdose mortality from 1999 to 2010 from all 50 states. In 2018, the same journal published a study of Medicare Part D patients, which found that in places where medical marijuana is legal, prescriptions for opioids decreased. ""Medical cannabis laws are associated with significant reductions in opioid prescribing in the Medicare Part D population,"" researchers wrote.   The National Institute on Drug Abuse, however, cautioned against reaching conclusions from the various published studies, some of which the institute funded. ""Some studies have suggested that medical marijuana legalization might be associated with decreased prescription opioid use and overdose deaths, but researchers don't have enough evidence yet to confirm this finding,"" the institute states. The studies ""are population-based and can’t show that medical marijuana legalization caused the decrease in deaths or that pain patients changed their drug-taking behavior."" What's more, a study published in September 2017 in the American Journal of Psychiatry offered a contradictory finding. Researchers at the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center and the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that ""cannabis use appears to increase rather than decrease the risk of developing nonmedical prescription opioid use and opioid use disorder."" The researchers relied on data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. More than 43,000 American adults were interviewed in 2001-2002 and follow-up interviews were done with 34,000 of them in 2004-2005.  The researchers found that although most adults who used marijuana did not develop an opioid use disorder, using marijuana significantly increased the risk of developing an opioid use disorder, according to a Columbia University release.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse acknowledges studies that show legally protected medical marijuana dispensaries, not just medical marijuana legalization, are associated with decreases in opioid prescribing, self-reports of opioid misuse, and treatment admissions for opioid addiction. The institute is continuing to study the relationship between legalized marijuana and opioid use, as well as marijuana’s possible use in treatment of opioid use disorder. McMurray said ""evidence is mounting"" that marijuana legalization reduces opioid addiction. He did not call it a proven fact, which may have led to a different ruling. There is evidence that in places where marijuana is legal, there are fewer opioid deaths and fewer opioid prescriptions. It's important to keep in mind that the change in number of prescriptions cannot be presumed to be a change in how many people overdose. Besides, overdoses from prescribed opioids is only one part of the crisis.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse has raised some red flags about drawing sweeping conclusions from the research and advises more studies are needed. McMurray's statement is accurate but needs additional information like what the institute provided, so we rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA45A00>],/factchecks/2018/aug/31/nathan-mcmurray/mcmurray-advocates-marijuana-legalization/

At the time, PolitiFact found that assertion to be well-grounded.  During the first quarter of 2017, West Virginia’s economy grew by exactly 3 percent, according to the data available at the time. (This figure was subsequently updated with new data, as is the standard procedure.) That was the second-fastest rate of any state in the country at the time. It was well above the national average for the first quarter, which was 1.2 percent. However, as we noted at the time, that was only one quarter’s worth of growth. How well has The Mountain State done since then? It’s been a bit of a roller coaster, according to data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. Here are the figures for annualized GDP growth for West Virginia on Trump’s watch. They are the most recent figures available, including updated data for the previous quarters.
  Quarter Annualized GDP growth for West Virginia 1st quarter 2017 6.6 percent 2nd quarter 2017 -1.1 percent 3rd quarter 2017 10.2 percent 4th quarter 2017 1.0 percent 1st quarter 2018 1.3 percent This chart shows that while West Virginia has had some highs in GDP growth during Trump’s tenure -- specifically, in the first and third quarters of 2017 -- the state’s GDP actually shrank during the second quarter of 2017, and in the most recent two quarters, it has grown only modestly, by 1 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively. In fact, during the most recent quarter for which data is available, West Virginia’s growth rate ranked as only the 37th best in the nation. That paints a different picture than the one Trump was offering at the rally. There’s another way to look at Trump’s assertion -- to compare gross domestic product per capita for West Virginia to the other states in the union. This statistic is calculated by dividing the state’s GDP by the state’s population. Measuring it this way makes Trump’s statement even less accurate. For 2017 -- the most recent full year for which data is available -- West Virginia ranked 47th nationally in GDP per capita, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The only states that ranked lower were Arkansas, Idaho and Mississippi. Finally, we’ll note that economists say presidents don’t deserve either full credit or full blame for employment trends on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters; broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles. Trump said, ""A few months ago, it hit where West Virginia is, on a per capita basis, one of the most successful (gross domestic product) states in our union."" Judging by quarterly GDP growth -- a measure Trump has used accurately in the past to talk about West Virginia -- the state chalked up two quarters of rapid growth but three quarters of stagnation. In the most recent two quarters, West Virginia was mired around 1 percent growth, ranking in the bottom half of states. Alternately, using GDP per capita, Trump is way off, as West Virginia ranks 47th among the states in this measure. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores evidence that would give a different impression, so we rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB1A440>],/factchecks/2018/aug/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-mostly-incorrect-about-wva-economic-g/

Does West Virginia produce the most AmeriCorps members? Yes
","Is West Virginia the largest source of members for AmeriCorps, a federally run network of national service programs that operate in communities to mentor youth, fight poverty, sustain national parks, and prepare for disasters? Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said so in a tweet on Aug. 8, 2018: ""West Virginians look out for one another and our commitment to service speaks for itself. This year West Virginia produced more @americorps members than any other state. Do you know an AmeriCorps member? Thank them for their service!""

On its website, AmeriCorps published a study listing the states that produced the most AmeriCorps volunteers for 2018. Here’s the list, which ranks the states based on a per-capita measurement, so that larger-population states don’t dominate the rankings: Rank State 1. West Virginia 2. Washington, D.C. 3. Minnesota 4. Utah 5. Vermont 6. Montana 7. Hawaii 8. New Mexico 9. Massachusetts 10. Maryland This is the first time West Virginia has ranked first. In 2017 and 2016, it ranked third, and in 2015, it ranked fifth. So why does West Virginia rank so high? History, said Dana Bryant, a spokeswoman for Volunteer West Virginia, the state's commission for national and community service. National service programs like AmeriCorps ""have a long history in West Virginia, from the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s to southern coalfield (Volunteers in Service to America) fighting poverty in the 1960s to the creation of AmeriCorps in 1993,"" she said. In West Virginia, ""volunteering is just a way of life,"" she said. West Virginia also received benefits from AmeriCorps. In 2017, the agency said, more than 3,800 people undertook national service in 600 locations across West Virginia and $12.2 million was invested, including ""reducing crime and reviving cities, connecting veterans to services, fighting the opioid epidemic, helping seniors live independently, and rebuilding communities after disasters."" Manchin tweeted, ""This year West Virginia produced more AmeriCorps members than any other state.""

Fact-checking Mike DeWine's attack on Rich Cordray about rape kit testing
","Republican Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said he has tested thousands of rape kits that his predecessor Richard Cordray had let languish. ""While Richard Cordray was Attorney General, 12,000 rape kits like Allyssa's were left untested. Cordray's failure left serial rapists free to strike again,"" said DeWine’s TV ad narrated by rape survivor Allyssa Allison. ""Then Mike DeWine became Attorney General. He tested all 12,000 rape kits. Now hundreds of rapists are behind bars."" DeWine ousted Cordray in 2010. The two men are now facing off for governor. DeWine portrays Cordray as ignoring untested rape kits as they piled up. But the backlog of untested rape kits can’t be blamed mainly on the attorney general; local police departments had a role, too. The ad omits that Cordray started to address the backlog as it drew more attention in the summer of 2010, but he had little time left in office.   ""Rape kits"" are shorthand for sexual assault forensic evidence kits, which are collected soon after a sexual assault or rape. A nurse or a doctor collects evidence including tissue and hair samples from the victim’s body and clothing, including saliva, blood and semen. The evidence helps law enforcement investigate assaults. The ad said that while Cordray was attorney general, 12,000 rape kits were left untested, but they were not sitting around his office. That number reflects those that were sent in by police departments across the state once DeWine took over. Untested rape kits languishing in police evidence rooms had been a longstanding problem in many states when Cordray became Ohio attorney general in 2009. Some departments didn’t test the kits, citing hassles or cost. The national backlog continues today. During Cordray’s tenure, news coverage by the Cleveland Plain Dealer led to more scrutiny. Here’s what was known about untested kits when Cordray was in office. In July 2010, the Cleveland Police said they had found in their possession more than 6,000 rape kits going back to 1993, some of which had already been tested. The department decided it would start submitting all kits for testing to the state. By mid 2011, Cleveland began submitting untested kits in small batches to the state, according to a timeline written by Case Western Reserve University. While Cordray was attorney general, Ohio -- like much of the country -- had no consistent testing policy. Each law enforcement agency decided whether and how to test rape kits, which could be done at local labs or sent to the state. Cleveland police decided whether to test kits on a case by case basis. The Plain Dealer reported that the state Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation would test every kit Cleveland planned to send, though its preference was for departments to limit their submissions to evidence that officials thought would be most likely to provide leads. (BCI is under the purview of the attorney general.) Cordray in 2010 called for lawmakers, law enforcement officials and victim advocates to study best practices for testing and develop a statewide protocol. In his final months in office, Cordray formed the Ohio Sexual Assault Kit Testing Commission and announced that the state would receive new DNA-testing robots to speed up testing. Cordray then lost to DeWine. In a recent conference call with reporters, Cordray questioned why DeWine took seven years -- until he was in the middle of a campaign -- to clear out the backlog. ""What he cannot explain is why it took him seven years to do a job he says I should have done in five months,"" he said. Cordray counterattacked with his own ad that featured Republican Shelby County Sheriff John Lenhart. The sheriff said that Cordray put the technology in place and ""fixed"" the backlog that had stretched for decades. That’s misleading -- while Cordray started to address the problem, he didn’t fix it. DeWine took office in January 2011. A few months later he restarted the rape kit test commission after the Cleveland Heights police department misplaced evidence tied to Anthony Sowell, a serial killer and rapist. The Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote in an editorial in May 2011 that ""building on an initiative of his predecessor, Richard Cordray, DeWine says he will stop sending DNA samples to private labs."" Instead, the state would handle processing. In December 2011, DeWine announced that police should submit all kits for testing if a crime probably occurred. At the time, about half of sexual assault kits were submitted to the state crime labs. DeWine started a new unit with four forensic scientists to test the old kits and began the push to clear out the backlog in 2012. Six more scientists were added later. Though DeWine deserves credit for tackling the backlog, so does Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty. His office worked with Cleveland police to inventory rape kits, which resulted in identifying thousands of untested rape kits that were submitted to the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation in 2014. The General Assembly played a role, too. In 2014, Gov. John Kasich signed Senate Bill 316 to require law enforcement agencies to forward untested rape kits to the state or other crime labs within one year. In February 2018, DeWine announced that the state had analyzed 13,931 rape kits and had loaded more than 8,600 DNA profiles to a federal database used by law enforcement. (The TV ad cited 12,000 rape kits because it subtracted any rapes that occurred after Cordray left office.) DeWine said that charges had been filed against hundreds of attackers. The Cuyahoga County Prosecutor said that they have convicted 376 defendants between 2013 and 2018 largely based on rapes that occurred between 1993 and 2010, before DeWine took office. The average prison sentence is 11 years. DeWine said in a TV ad, ""While Richard Cordray was Attorney General, 12,000 rape kits like Allyssa's were left untested. Cordray's failure left serial rapists free to strike again. Then Mike DeWine became Attorney General. He tested all 12,000 rape kits. Now hundreds of rapists are behind bars."" The ad leaves out a lot of context when it blames Cordray. First, it omits that Cordray inherited a statewide problem. Cordray started to take steps to address the problem, but didn’t get far before he was ousted by DeWine in November 2010. The ad is on firmer ground when it gives credit to DeWine for his efforts to clear out the backlog. But it omits that it took him several years to do it. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context.

Attack ad falsely says Bredesen backed gas, sales tax hikes that never happened
","In the battle for the U.S. Senate, the Koch family-backed Americans for Prosperity launched a $2 million ad campaign against Tennessee Democrat Phil Bredesen. The group's ad targets Bredesen’s time as governor from 2003 to 2011. Bredesen will face Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn on the November ballot.  The ad opens with a shot of a woman, child in her arms, shopping for groceries. Here’s the text: ""When times are tough, we budget for our families. But when our state’s budget was in crisis, Phil Bredesen supported higher taxes on us. Higher gas taxes. Higher sales taxes."" The ad ends with a claim about wasteful spending on rebuilding the governor’s mansion. For this fact-check, we wanted to review the data for gas taxes and sales taxes to see if they went up on Bredesen’s watch. While the ad suggests that gas and sales taxes rose, they remained the same through Bredesen’s years in office. At times, Bredesen suggested the gas tax might need to go up. The sales tax on food fell from 6 percent to 5.5 percent, but taxes on cigarettes and cell phone plans rose. Bredesen proposed eliminating the cap on a separate tax on big-ticket items such as jewelry and business equipment, but the Legislature rejected it. Tennessee’s Department of Transportation has a handy table of gas and fuel taxes going back to 1923. It shows no change in the gas tax between 1990 and 2017. It stayed at 21.4 cents/gallon through all the time Bredesen was governor. (The base rate was 20 cents with 1.4 cents in special fees tacked on.) Americans for Prosperity spokeswoman Gabrielle Braud noted that at various times, in 2003, 2006 and 2007, Bredesen said the gas tax might need to rise a few cents to secure federal highway matching funds and keep pace with rising costs. That is accurate, but Bredesen didn’t press the point. There is no evidence that he advocated for a hike. And as the recession was building in 2008, Bredesen told reporters that a gas tax increase was off the table, saying it would be a ""terrible time"" to ask people to pay more in taxes. As with the gas tax, the state sales tax held steady. The Tennessee Department of Revenue told us ""the general state sales tax rate of 7 percent did not change between 2003 to 2011."" According to the Tax Foundation, a group that tracks state and federal revenues, the rate went from 6 percent to 7 percent right before Bredesen took office and didn’t change on his watch. The Economic Research Service at the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed those numbers. Since the ad opens with a mother at a supermarket, we looked into any hike in taxes on food. The tax on groceries actually went down when Bredesen was governor. Bredesen and lawmakers agreed to trim that levy by half a percentage point from 6 percent to 5.5 percent in 2007. The Presbyterian Church was one of the groups that supported the change and said that it was ""the first-ever reduction of the state’s high food tax."" Bredesen made it a point to avoid raising the sales tax but he was quite open to other ways to boost revenues, especially as the state struggled through the recession. The year the sales tax on groceries went down, the cigarette tax went up, with most of the money targeted to education. The Tax Foundation’s analysis of the tobacco tax hike found that it fell most heavily on lower income households. In 2010, he, along with the Legislature, raised the fee for a driver’s license from $19.50 for five years to $46 for eight years, and increased the tax on cable and telecommunication services. Tennessee has a special sales tax on big ticket items such as cars and boats. An additional 2.75 percent charge is tacked on for each dollar between $1,600 and up to $3,200, at which point the tax stops. Braud noted that in 2010 Bredesen wanted to lift the upper limit. He did, but not across the board. His proposal left cars, boats and homes alone. Bredesen argued that the tax would fall mainly on businesses, not households. Lawmakers rejected the plan. Americans for Prosperity said that Bredesen supported higher gas and sales taxes. Neither tax changed on his watch. Both the gas and state sales tax remained the same throughout his time as governor. Food taxes went down and cigarette taxes went up. While he piecemealed additional revenues here and there, he opposed raising the broad-base sales tax. The ad uses the word ""support"" in the broadest fashion possible to mislead Tennesseans about their experiences under Bredesen. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC995C0>],/factchecks/2018/aug/30/americans-prosperity/attack-ad-falsely-says-bredesen-backed-gassales-ta/

Deceptive Facebook post distorts California proposal on abortion med
","A stock photo of a smiling soccer team of young girls accompanies an article from YourNewsWire.com claiming that free abortion pills would be pushed on ""all students"" in California under a proposed law. Not quite. If SB 320 passes the state Assembly, it will mandate access to medication abortion on the 34 public campuses in the University of California and California State University systems. The legislation refers to medication abortions, where pills are prescribed to end pregnancy in the first 10 weeks. The medications involved, mifepristone and misoprostol, are sometimes referred to as abortion pills. But those medication abortions won’t be free, and they won’t be available to ""all students across the state."" The bill involves public state universities and their student health centers — not high schools or private schools. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The majority of the Your News Wire article was lifted from an opinion piece written by Lila Rose, the founder and president of the anti-abortion group Live Action, known for creating ""sting"" videos targeting Planned Parenthood. This original column ran on WashingtonExaminer.com, a conservative-leaning publication. Your News Wire changed the column’s headline from ""California moving to mandate abortion pills on campus"" to the more inclusive and incorrect ""California to supply free abortion pills to all students."" We contacted the article's author, Sean Adl-Tabatabai, and the article was deleted from the site within minutes. ""Since being alerted to this we have decided to completely remove the article from our website as we cannot substantiate the claims made,"" Adl-Tabatabai said in an email. Here's where their original reporting went wrong. The bill passed the state Senate in January. It hasn’t passed the Assembly, as of Aug. 29. If SB 320 becomes law, California would be the first state to mandate that medication abortions be available as part of basic university student health services. Only two universities surveyed in the 2015 American College Health Association PAP & STI Survey provided medication abortions at their health centers. The University of Illinois at Chicago is one example. Its student health center started providing medication abortions in 2006. Medication abortions cost about $600 out-of-pocket, according to an August study about the California measure that was published in the Journal of Adolescent Health. If provided on-campus, they would not be free, but the cost might be reduced. ""While it is not yet known how much students would pay for an on-campus medication abortion, the costs are likely to be the same or lower than those going to an off-campus clinic,"" the study stated. Those costs would be handled the same as other student health services, according to Sergio Reyes, communications director for state Sen. Connie Leyva, who introduced the bill. ""Medication abortion services at student health centers could be paid for the way any other basic health care on campus is covered,"" Reyes said. ""Some options that are available to student health centers are for them to bill Medi-Cal, charge a fee for service, cover it through student fees or by contracting with a community provider who comes to campus and handles the billing."" Initial costs for preparing student health centers to administer medication abortions would be privately funded, according to the text of the bill. From those private funds, grants of up to $200,000 would be administered to student health centers to pay for the equipment and training needed to be able to perform medication abortions by 2022. Separate $200,000 grants would fund telehealth services, services to bill insurance and Medi-Cal and a 24-hour hotline for people who have had a medication abortion at a student health center. ""SB 320 aims to have private grants pay for the cost to get each student health center ready to provide this service, but is not prescriptive in how each student health center decides to fund it on an ongoing basis,"" Reyes said. He added that student health centers are already responsible for covering all operating costs of th health centers, and that the only additional cost would be the medication, at approximately $60 to$70 dollars per pill. Reyes said that a person seeking a medication abortion must first meet with a health care provider, who determines the age of the pregnancy. The Your News Wire headline said, ""California lawmakers are planning to push free abortion pills on all students across the state as part of a ‘super progressive’ new policy."" While the California Legislature is moving toward mandating on-campus medication abortion services, that’s quite a bit different than ""pushing"" abortion pills on ""all students across the state."" The bill only applies to college health centers. The cost will not be free like the Your News Wire headline states, but will be billed the same way as other college health services. We also found the article's photo of a soccer team — featuring young girls with braces and pigtails — extremely misleading.  We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE15AC0>],/factchecks/2018/aug/30/yournewswirecom/free-abortion-pills-will-not-be-pushed-california-/

Tony Evers cherry picks an old statistic in claiming Wisconsin infrastructure near-worst
","At a rally for Democrats who had won their primaries, Tony Evers lamented that various things he described as Wisconsin values ""have been trashed."" ""Another thing that’s a Wisconsin value is infrastructure, whether it’s roads or bridges,"" the party’s gubernatorial nominee said in Madison on Aug. 16, 2018, two days after the elections. ""My God,"" he declared, ""we are 49th out of 50 states in infrastructure."" Are Wisconsin’s bones in such bad shape? Evers made the 49th-in-infrastructure claim before he defeated seven other Democrats to win the nomination. And he has made it clear he’ll criticize Republican Gov. Scott Walker on infrastructure ahead of the general election. There’s room to criticize Walker on infrastructure, particularly when it comes to roads. But Evers went beyond just roads in making his claim. And he cherry picked a ranking that is too-narrow and not up to date. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. ‘Infrastructure’ definitions vary Let’s start by noting there is not a universal definition of infrastructure, as various rankings show. U.S. News & World Report, in its ""Best States 2017"" ratings,"" ranked Wisconsin 39th in infrastructure  — which included an assortment of factors, such as roads, bridges, renewable energy usage, broadband access and others. Road quality was where Wisconsin ranked 49th. That’s where Evers got his statistic. Tens of millions in tax money directed to a Milwaukee streetcar at the expense of police, schools? Mostly False. But again, roads are only one part of infrastructure. And there are at least three more recent rankings on infrastructure  — including the current one by U.S. News -- where Wisconsin is in the middle, or even higher: U.S. News & World Report: In the magazine’s ""2018 Best States"" report, released in February 2018, Wisconsin ranked 26th overall on infrastructure. That included a ranking of 14th in energy  — for electricity price, power grid reliability and renewable energy usage;  41st in internet access — for broadband access and ultra-fast internet access; and 34th in transportation  — for road quality and bridge quality, commute time and public transit usage. (Specifically on road quality, Wisconsin ranked 44th, up a bit from 49th.) Wisconsin is ""49th in the country in internet speed."" Half True. CNBC: The business news TV network said it evaluated road and bridge quality, commute time, the availability of air travel and other factors to rank the states on infrastructure. For 2018, Wisconsin ranked 23rd. 24/7 Wall Street: The financial news website ranked the states in early August 2018 with an index using the share of bridges, roads and dams that are ""in a state of disrepair or potentially hazardous,"" and it looked at state highway spending per person. On that measure of infrastructure, Wisconsin ranked 15th  — as in 15th worst, as this ranking was done differently. All our fact checks in the governor’s race.  We’ll also note that the American Society of Civil Engineers rates the nation’s infrastructure in 16 categories, including roads and bridges. Its most recent report, for 2017, gave the nation a grade of D+. That report says that in Wisconsin, ""driving on roads in need of repair"" costs each driver $637 per year and 8.7 percent of the state’s bridges are rated structurally deficient. But the report doesn’t give grades to the states and doesn’t rank the states. It’s also worth noting, with regard to roads, that we rated Mostly False a Walker claim that he had invested $3 billion more in the state’s transportation system than his predecessor did. And our rating was Mostly False when Walker said state road projects ""are staying on track or getting done sooner."" Our rating Evers says Wisconsin is ""49th out of 50 states in infrastructure."" His statement relies on a too-narrow ranking that isn’t current, and it ignores other rankings. In 2017, U.S. News & World Report ranked Wisconsin 49th in road quality  — but 39th in overall infrastructure, based not only on roads but bridges, renewable energy usage, broadband access and other factors. Moreover, the magazine’s 2018 report ranks Wisconsin 26th in infrastructure. And Wisconsin is well above the bottom, though not great, in two other national rankings.

NC Speaker says constitutional amendment puts NC in line with other states
","There must be a shift in the universe if all of the living former North Carolina governors, both Democratic and Republican, come together to take a stand against the actions of the General Assembly. What exactly is that cosmic force? A constitutional amendment that would take away the governor’s sole power to appoint judges during vacancies, and hand it over to the General Assembly. Democrats have decried the proposal as a seismic power shift, and a three-panel judge three-judge panel recently told the legislature (which is controlled by Republicans) to rewrite the amendment language. How radical is this power shift, really? Not very, says House Speaker Tim Moore. Moore said on Aug. 24 that the proposed constitutional amendment ""actually puts us in line with what most other states do. Very few states allow a governor unilateral and sole discretion to pick those judges who continue to serve."" What the proposal would change Currently, in North Carolina, the governor has the full discretion to appoint someone to fill a vacant judicial seat to serve until the next general election. Judges in North Carolina are selected through partisan elections. The constitutional amendment, if it passes, would lead to the creation of a Nonpartisan Judicial Merit Commission of no more than nine members. The members of the commission would be picked by the governor, the General Assembly and the state’s chief justice. The commission would verify that all candidates who apply are legally qualified and assess their merit, without regard for party affiliation. The list of candidates then would go to the General Assembly, and lawmakers would pick at least two for the governor to choose from. Is this a revolutionary change? Not really. What other states do When PolitiFact reached out to Moore’s office, spokesperson Joseph Kyzer cited a Ballotpedia page that says ""34 states and the District of Columbia use some variation of assisted appointment."" The Ballotpedia information includes all states that use a merit commission in some form, including for first-term appointments, judicial vacancies or in combination with other methods. According to data from the New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, most states do actually have some type of merit commission in place to help select judges. When filling a state Supreme Court vacancy, 34 states do use some type of merit nominating commission during the process according to the data from the Brennan Center. Only seven states currently allow the governor to directly fill state Supreme Court vacancies: Alabama, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Arkansas and Washington. When filling vacancies in state appellate courts, the Brennan Center reports, 23 states use a nominating commission. Meanwhile, 34 states use nominating commissions to fill vacant judgeships in trial courts. Types of merit selection It sounds as if most states do have some type of merit nominating commission, although there are a few differences in how they operate. Missouri was the first state to have a merit commission in 1940. Its setup is often regarded as the ""gold standard"" merit commission plan. The Missouri State Bar, Governor and Supreme Court have an equal share in choosing commission members. Those members then elect who the head of the commission will be. The Missouri legislature has no say in the matter. Bill Raftery, a senior analyst at the National Center for State Courts, says some don’t have the Missouri plan in place because states interpret ""merit commission"" differently and with varying degrees of involvement from legislators. He said because of that the term ""merit commission"" can be misleading by suggesting that a third party is involved in selecting judges. In the proposed North Carolina commission, the General Assembly, Governor and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court would select the commission members. The state’s current Chief Justice is Mark Martin, a Republican. He was elected in 2014 for an eight year term. According to information from the nonpartisan American Judicature Society, seven states give their legislature some type of role in appointing commission members. An NC nominating commission That’s not the only major difference between the proposed North Carolina commission and other commissions. In the proposed amendment, the role of the commission would be to make sure the candidates are qualified to fill judicial vacancies, as prescribed by the law, without regard to their party affiliation. The commission’s evaluation would then be sent to the General Assembly, who will choose at least two candidates for the governor to choose from. ""The nominating commission is only tasked with determining if the applicants meet the legal qualifications to be a judge, which is different than how nominating commissions are used in other states,"" said Douglas Keith, counsel in the Democracy program for the New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice. Stephen Ware, a law professor at the University of Kansas, says that, based on the description in the ballot, the merit commission would play a less powerful role than in other states if its objective is to check ""legal requirements as opposed to assessing the pros and cons of applicants and making the hard choices of who would be better."" In fact, most merit commissions are tasked with ""narrowing down a pool of applicants to a few finalists"" for the governor or legislature to select from says Ware. Our ruling Despite differences among the states in how commissions operate, Moore’s statement is mostly true. Most states do in fact have some type of merit commission in place, and these commissions do play a role in appointing judges during vacancies. However, the proposed North Carolina merit commission would have a different role than in most other states.

Ted Cruz says Beto O'Rourke voted against tax relief for Hurricane Harvey victims
","Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz says in an online video ad that he voted for tax relief for victims of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 as his Democratic challenger, Rep. Beto O’Rourke of El Paso, ridiculously voted ""no."" The narrator of Cruz’s August 2018 ad, which features photos of water rescues and Cruz on the scene of the devastating hurricane, says: ""Congressman O’Rourke is so irresponsible that he even voted against hurricane tax relief."" A House roll call shows that O’Rourke, a congressman since 2013, was among 155 representatives to vote against the House’s Sept. 28, 2017, passage of the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017, for which 264 members, including 43 Democrats, cast ""yea"" votes. The same day, the House concurred with a Senate amendment to the proposal and two days later President Donald Trump signed that into law. The measure folded in tax relief for hurricane victims. A September 2017 Houston Chronicle news story on the action, crediting Cruz with leading the effort to pass the legislation, said key provisions--approved two weeks after Congress advanced more than $15 billion in aid to Harvey victims--would permit Harvey victims to access their retirement funds penalty-free, allow victims to easily write off hurricane losses and provide a tax credit of up to $6,000 for employers who hire in a declared disaster area like Harris County, home to hard-hit Houston. Also, the story said, charitable giving might be spurred by the measure's waiving of deduction limits. Also, the proposal included language allowing taxpayers to use income from the past year to determine the Earned Income Tax Credit or Child Tax Credit, the story said. O'Rourke voted for direct aid When we asked O’Rourke’s campaign about his ""no"" vote, spokesman Chris Evans replied by email that O’Rourke, who otherwise voted for direct hurricane relief, voted against the measure singled out by Cruz ""because it dramatically shortchanged Harvey victims by providing significantly smaller tax breaks than those given after Hurricane Sandy,"" which slammed the East Coast in 2012. Hold that comparison: The American Institute of CPAs put us in touch with a Louisiana expert, CPA Jerry Schreiber, who told us by phone that Congress didn’t provide tax breaks to victims of Hurricane Sandy. Another congressional roll-call vote shows that earlier, on Sept. 25, 2017, O’Rourke joined a sufficient number of House members to keep the act from being immediately considered and passed by the House. O'Rourke's explanation for opposition to tax-relief legislation After that vote, O’Rourke posted a statement saying that he supported the measure’s main thrust--reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration and programs set to expire that week--but voted against the House moving along because ""other initiatives that are critical to the livelihood of our families and neighbors in El Paso were excluded."" O’Rourke’s statement went on: ""Without returning this legislation for further improvement, I am not confident Congress would have reauthorized these programs. ""For example, H.R. 3823 left out reauthorizing the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Community Health Centers only days before their funding is set to expire. The recent debate on health care in our country has only reinforced the need for quality, affordable care. That simply will not be possible without these two programs that so many children and families in El Paso rely on. ""Additionally, the bill would have left victims of recent natural disasters — including Hurricane Harvey — without sufficient assistance as they work to recover and rebuild. The bill provided help in the form of tax breaks at a much lower rate than those provided to victims of both Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Katrina. ""Ultimately, H.R. 3823 failed to pass the House. With less than a week remaining to reauthorize the FAA, CHIP, and Community Health Centers, I urge my colleagues to pass an improved version of this legislation that extends these programs while ensuring that we continue to aid those recovering from Harvey and other recent natural disasters."" Our ruling Cruz said O’Rourke irresponsibly voted against tax relief for Hurricane Harvey victims. O’Rourke voted against the proposal delivering tax relief though Cruz's statement, suggesting a didn't-care attitude, leaves unsaid that O’Rourke offered some reasons for his opposition and had voted for direct aid to victims.

Has Congressman John Carter not held a town hall in five years?
","Has a Central Texas congressman not hosted a ""town hall"" meeting for half a decade? Democrat M.J. Hegar of Round Rock says as much about the Republican she’s challenging to represent the state’s 31st Congressional District, eight-term Rep. John Carter of Round Rock. The district, north of Austin, sweeps in Williamson and Bell counties. Hegar, a decorated Air Force veteran, has promoted her candidacy with a video in which she says that she once tried but failed to land a meeting with Carter about lifting the ban on women to participate in ground combat. ""We’ll show him tough,"" Hegar says in the video. ""Then we’ll show him the door."" Hegar said of Carter in an Aug. 21, 2018 interview on Spectrum News's ""Capital Tonight:"" ""He hasn’t had a town hall in five years and he’s kind of acting as if he wants to retire."" Hegar points to news stories We sought Hegar’s factual backup for her claim mindful that Merriam-Webster defines a town hall as ""an event at which a public official or political candidate addresses an audience by answering questions posed by individual members."" The dictionary makes clear that such a gathering doesn’t have to enable anyone to ask anything. Merriam-Webster follows the definition with this sample sentence: ""Town halls have lost some of their spontaneity. The 80 or so undecided voters chosen for Tuesday's event must submit their questions in advance and moderator Candy Crowley of CNN will decide which people to call on."" Christian Walker of Hegar’s campaign pointed us to a Texas Observer article describing a 2013 town-hall meeting where Carter faced critical questions. Walker also singled out a February 2017 Austin American-Statesman news story quoting a Round Rock resident, Felicia Miyakawa, saying Carter’s staff had told her and others that Carter hadn’t hosted live town hall meetings since the shooting of U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., at a public meeting with constituents in 2011. Carter spokeswoman Corry Schiermeyer responded at the time: ""I wouldn’t say that is ‘the’ reason, but it would be correct to say it contributes to the many reasons. Mostly town halls are not nearly as effective, and you can’t reach nearly as many people as a tele-town hall."" One alternative: Mass conference calls. The American-Statesman story said: ""Many members of Congress prefer the safety of tele-town hall meetings, which offer interaction with constituents but in a controlled setting — essentially large-scale conference calls in which hundreds or thousands of people can listen in and queue up to ask a question — with no booing, no signs with clever slogans, no bad headlines, no viral videos."" Carter held an hour-long tele-town hall on March 22, 2017, according to an American-Statesman news blog post. More recently, an Aug. 11, 2018, news story in the newspaper said Carter had reached out to residents through Facebook Live events. Carter: ‘Man of the people’ When we asked Carter about Hegar’s claim, he said by phone that he’d held multiple events attended by people asking questions. ""I’ve been all over my district now, for 12- to 14-hour days, which is pretty typical of my work in Augusts each year. I would say I’m way ahead of my opponent in the Man-of-the-People category,"" Carter said. When we inquired into Carter’s formal schedule, we heard back from his office’s Emily Taylor. By email, Taylor listed four August 2018 events where, she said, Carter took questions from constituents on topics including federal pensions, Fort Hood and the legalization of marijuana. The events, Taylor said, were hosted by the Temple Kiwanis Club (Aug. 7); American Legion Post 133 (Aug. 14); the Military Officers Association of America (Aug. 17); and the Killeen Chamber of Commerce (Aug. 23). An Aug. 14, 2018 Temple Daily Telegram news story on the American Legion event includes a section titled ""Town Hall"" stating that Carter ""took a few minutes to discuss congressional business and field questions from the audience."" We asked if Carter had held public town halls open to all constituents. Taylor replied that Carter had hosted 25 telephone town halls in five years, the latest one on June 18, 2018. ""The last four alone have reached 71,471 constituents,"" Taylor wrote. Also, Taylor said, Carter holds Facebook Live ""town halls, where constituents can tune in online and ask real-time questions or submit questions on our website if they’re unable to tune in during the live event."" She pointed us to a nearly 20-minute Facebook Live that Carter held July 2, 2018. Such events are publicized, Taylor wrote, through Carter’s electronic newsletters. Our ruling Hegar said Carter ""hasn’t held a town hall in five years."" As Hegar maintained, it looks like Carter hasn't hosted a traditional in-person town hall any time recently. Yet he holds tele-town halls, makes Facebook Live appearances and talks at meetings hosted by local groups. We rate this claim Mostly True.

Wildfires or cars? Which produces more emissions?
","Wildfires have ravaged California again this year, destroying hundreds of homes and killing six firefighters, as well as several residents. This year also produced the largest single fire in California’s history, the Ranch Fire, which had burned more than 400,000 acres and spread across four counties near the Mendocino National Forest as of late August. Smoke up and down the state, for days at a time, has blanketed metro areas miles from the fires, raising worries about air quality and pollution. The wildfires have led some, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, to claim the blazes are spewing out more pollution than the state’s millions of vehicles. ""I have a real concern about air quality because of where I come from,"" McCarthy, a Republican who represents the southern San Joaquin Valley, including Bakersfield, said during a speech in Sacramento on Aug. 15, 2018. ""(We’re at the) bottom of all the mountains and we collect (air pollution) all the way from San Francisco."" ""What I have found, because of these fires, there are studies that are showing they are producing more emissions than all of our cars are doing,"" he added.  SOURCE: Public Policy Institute of California Was McCarthy right? We decided to fact-check his wildfires-versus-cars comparison. Our research Sean Raffuse, an analyst at the UC Davis Air Quality Research Center, told us McCarthy’s statement is correct, but for only for one category of emissions — particulate matter. The claim is not true, however, for climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions, he said. Cars still produce far more of those. Particulate matter, or PM, is a mixture of microscopic particles and liquid droplets that, when inhaled, can affect the heart and lungs and cause serious health problems. For months, officials have issued health warnings that particulate matter from the wildfires could trigger asthma attacks or aggravate chronic heart and lung diseases. Specifically, Raffuse said, the fires produce more PM 2.5 than all cars. PM 2.5 refers to particles two and one half microns or less in width, or about thirty times smaller than that of a human hair. ""PM 2.5 emissions are greater than what we see from cars, and that’s typical, not just of California during the wildfire season,"" he said, ""but even if you look overall at the nation for an entire year, there will be more emissions from particles from wildfires than there will be from motor vehicles."" Clean combustion regulations, he said, are one reason vehicles produce fewer particulate matter than fires. Earlier this month, the Trump administration proposed rules that would ease vehicle emissions standards nationwide. The proposal would also challenge the right of states, California in particular, to set their own, more stringent tailpipe pollution standards. Greenhouse gas emissions Bill Stewart, a researcher at the UC Berkeley Center for Forestry, said there’s a key point missing from McCarthy’s statement. While fires emit more particulate matter, cars produce far more greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, he said. ""Those are two important but different issues,"" Stewart said. Mike Kleeman, a UC Davis professor of environmental engineering, added that wildfires also emit some greenhouse gases. ""But burned areas also regrow during which time they act as a net carbon sink.  Assuming a burned area regrows completely over a time of decades, the net CO2 emissions should be low,"" Kleeman wrote in an email. ""Wildfires are a problem,"" he added, ""and we should be taking steps to reduce their frequency and intensity. But it isn't an ‘apples to apples’ comparison to an every-day source like cars."" McCarthy’s response Asked for evidence supporting the claim, McCarthy’s spokesman pointed to an October 2017 NBC News story that examined the emissions produced by that year’s deadly Wine Country fires. The story had the misleading headline: ""California Wildfires Emitted a Year's Worth of Car Pollution in Less Than a Week."" It quoted Raffuse of UC Davis, who told NBC the fires had released the same amount of particulate matter as come from California vehicles in one year. He didn’t claim the fires had produced more of all types of emissions than cars. In the article, the researcher ""pointed out cars pollute in other ways, too."" Raffuse summed up the congressman’s statement saying it’s ""partially correct but omits a key distinction."" McCarthy’s spokesman did not cite any specific studies to support the claim. We reviewed several that described wildfire emissions as a growing concern, but did not say they produce more pollution overall compared with cars. One such report by the Sierra Nevada Conservancy in 2014 found that by the year 2085, emissions from wildfires are projected to be equal to the annual emissions of about one fifth of all of the cars currently registered in California. Our ruling House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy recently claimed ""because of these fires, there are studies that are showing they are producing more emissions than all of our cars are doing."" Wildfires produce more of one key pollutant, particulate matter, than cars, both in California and nationwide. But that’s all. McCarthy cherry-picked this one category and ignored the fact that cars produce far more greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, than fires. We rate McCarthy’s claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.
