Debbie Wasserman Schultz incorrectly says only 4 or 5 states have seen Obamacare insurers quit
","Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., had to play defense over the Affordable Care Act -- sometimes called Obamacare -- during an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Oct. 25. The previous afternoon, the federal government had announced that premiums for plans under the act would rise an average of 22 percent in 2017. While most plan-holders would see their federal subsidies increase to ease the premium hike, the news was an unwelcome development for Democrats, especially in the final days of an election season. On CNN, Blitzer asked Wasserman Schultz about the hikes, saying, ""that’s not the way it was supposed to be, was it?"" She responded, ""Well, we're in a transition year, and as I said, you have 91 percent of … previously uninsured Americans in Florida who are eligible for a tax credit, which brings those costs down. So those numbers are really an anomaly. It's four or five states where the number of insurance options have narrowed and so premiums have increased, but we're going to be able to make sure that if we just sit down together and iron out the kinks that have occurred with Obamacare."" The part that caught our eye had to do with the decline in the number of insurers offering policies under the Affordable Care Act, which is considered one of the factors driving the rise in premiums. Is Wasserman Schultz correct that ""it's four or five states where the number of insurance options have narrowed""? Actually, it’s more than that. Data released in the same Department of Health and Human Services report that unveiled the 22-percent projected premium increase showed that at least 29 states have fewer plan issuers in 2017 than they did in 2016 -- many more than Wasserman Schultz had said. (An issuer is defined as a company that offers insurance plans on a state's exchange.) Here’s a list of the states that are seeing a decrease in companies offering plans under the act between 2016 and 2017. State Issuers in 2016 Issuers in 2017 Decline, 2016 to 2017 Alabama 3 1 -2 Alaska 2 1 -1 Arizona 8 2 -6 Arkansas 5 4 -1 California 12 11 -1 Connecticut 4 2 -2 Florida 10 7 -3 Georgia 9 5 -4 Illinois 9 5 -4 Indiana 8 4 -4 Kansas 4 3 -1 Louisiana 5 4 -1 Massachusetts 11 10 -1 Michigan 14 10 -4 Minnesota 5 4 -1 Mississippi 3 2 -1 Missouri 7 4 -3 North Carolina 3 2 -1 Nebraska 4 2 -2 New Jersey 6 3 -3 Ohio 16 11 -5 Oklahoma 2 1 -1 Oregon 9 6 -3 Pennsylvania 13 8 -5 South Carolina 4 1 -3 Tennessee 4 3 -1 Texas 19 10 -9 Utah 4 3 -1 Wisconsin 16 15 -1 States not listed above either saw no change in insurers offering plans, saw an increase in insurers, or had complications that make comparisons tricky. Including all states for which data is available, the number of issuers dropped from 298 in 2016 to 228 in 2017, a decrease of about 23 percent. Nationally, the number of insurers exiting a state outpaced the number of insurers newly entering a state by a factor of more than 5-to-1. Geoff Burgan, press secretary for Wasserman Schultz, did not contest that the number is higher than what she said, instead arguing that ""while some states are seeing decreases in insurers, nearly 80 percent of marketplace customers will be able to choose between competing insurers – which is a sharp contrast to the time before the Affordable Care Act became law."" Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said, ""It's four or five states where the number of insurance options have narrowed"" under the Affordable Care Act. According to official federal data, she’s way off, because 29 states have seen the number of insurance options narrowed. We rate her statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4cc846e0-1d46-443d-806c-c70caaa2a785",/factchecks/2016/oct/26/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-incorrectly-says-only-4-o/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'Patrick Murphy']","
Patrick Murphy says his family never did business with Donald Trump, but it's more complicated
","U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy has lambasted U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio for continuing to endorse Donald Trump for president. Rubio has fired back by portraying Murphy, a Democrat, as having business ties to Trump. ""There's only one person on the stage tonight whose family made millions of dollars in partnership with Donald Trump and that's you,"" Rubio said in the first Senate debate on Oct. 17. After the debate, in a TV interview with WFLA that aired Oct. 23, Murphy said that Rubio wasn’t telling the truth. ""It's an absolute lie. We’ve never done business with Donald Trump,"" Murphy said. ""And Marco Rubio is just trying to distract and confuse the voters because he’s so concerned with his own choice for president."" Reporter Candace McCowan followed up: ""Was there not some dealings between him and your father on a real estate deal?"" ""No, absolutely not. We’ve never had a contract with Donald Trump,"" Murphy said. Who’s telling the truth here? We found that Coastal Construction, a luxury residential building firm owned by Murphy’s father, Thomas P. Murphy Jr., did have business dealings related to Trump. But they were not direct contractual agreements, and they require further explanation. Condo construction projects During the debate, Rubio was referring to two condo projects that Coastal Construction built: Trump Hollywood and Trump Royale in Sunny Isles Beach. According to Coastal Construction’s website, it built Trump Royale, a 55-story, 386-residence project owned by Dezer Properties. Coastal won the contract for the project in 2005. Coastal won the contract to build Trump Hollywood in 2007, a 42-story, 208-unit condo project owned by The Related Group. (Although Patrick worked at Coastal Construction in the past, for much of the time that the condos were under construction, Patrick worked at Deloitte. Patrick Murphy owns between $1 million and $5 million in assets from Coastal Construction, according to congressional financial disclosure forms.) We interviewed Thomas P. Murphy Jr. as well as the owners of both projects, to find out the connection between Coastal Construction and Trump. There is no dispute that Coastal Construction was the builder, and Trump’s organization had the licensing deal. But it was the owners -- The Related Group and Dezer Development -- who hired Coastal. The Related Group and Dezer reached an agreement with Trump separately. ""I hired Coastal to build the building, and I signed up with the Trump Organization for the licensing deal,"" said Gil Dezer, president of Dezer Development. ""The licensing deal was just that. It gave them no rights to construction decisions."" (An article in The Real Deal, a real estate publication, in 2008 described a more intensive business relationship between Dezer and Trump and referred to Trump as Dezer’s ""development partner."") We received a similar statement about Trump from The Related Group. ""Mr. Trump’s role was that of licensor; he was not a partner in the development, and he had no role in the actual development process or the hiring of Coastal Construction,"" said Betsy McCoy, The Related Group’s general counsel and vice president. Although Murphy wasn’t the one who entered into the agreement with Trump, he knew about Trump’s role, which had been publicized in news reports. The projects were clearly branded with the Trump name. ""We are extremely excited to be a part of this project and for the opportunity to continue working with such a reputable and powerful development team,"" Murphy told the South Florida Business Journal in 2007 about the Hollywood project. ""The tower's sleek and innovative design is sure to make its mark on the Hollywood skyline, and we look forward to delivering it on time."" Both Murphys have downplayed the link to Trump during the campaign, particularly after the first debate. ""Coastal has never worked with Donald Trump personally or with any of his businesses,"" Thomas P. Murphy told PolitiFact Florida. After the debate, Patrick Murphy distanced his father’s firm from Trump. ""It’s an absolute lie,"" Murphy told NBC8 in Tampa. ""We’ve never done business with Donald Trump. ""We have never done business with Donald Trump,"" he told CBS in Tampa. Murphy told a reporter for the Tampa Bay Times, the owner of PolitiFact, that Coastal Construction had nothing to do with the Trump licensing agreement. ""What that developer names that building, what they call it, has nothing to do with us,""’ he said. ""We’ve never had a single contract with Donald Trump."" But clearly Coastal Construction at the time was aware of Trump’s role and didn’t appear to have a problem with it. CNN reported Oct. 25 that in a photo obtained from Getty, Thomas P. Murphy can be seen with Trump and a group of people wearing Trump-branded hard hats at the groundbreaking ceremony for Trump Hollywood in 2007. (Thomas P. Murphy is on the far left.) Murphy’s campaign spokesman Joshua Karp said that Trump’s involvement was irrelevant to Coastal’s role building the units. ""Trump's name may have helped market the condo units after Coastal's role was completed, but Coastal has never benefited from Trump at all,"" he said. ""The developers paid Coastal for services, which was construction, and developers paid Donald Trump for the privilege of using his name and image in promotional materials. Point of fact, there was no money connection between Trump and Coastal Construction."" So would we call the projects a ""partnership"" between Coastal Construction and Trump as Rubio said? We posed that question to Jack McCabe, a South Florida real estate expert hired as an expert witness on behalf of condo buyers in two separate Trump condo cases in Tampa and Fort Lauderdale. McCabe said that when condo buyers signed contracts, it included a paragraph that stated Trump was not a partner. ""Even though buyers had every inclination Trump was an actual partner in the deals, the paperwork said otherwise,"" he said. But it also appears that Coastal Construction boasted of doing work for Trump once. Coastal Construction president Dan Whiteman in 2008 told South Florida Constructor, a trade publication, ""Many of (Coastal’s) high-rise residential projects have been built for world-renowned developers including Jorge Perez, Craig Robins and Donald Trump."" That quote was included in opposition research that Murphy’s 2014 congressional campaign commissioned. On Oct. 14, BuzzFeed reported about the opposition research. Rubio said that Murphy’s family made ""millions"" off the condo projects. We don’t know the amount Coastal Construction earned, since it is a private firm. However, McCabe told us that the industry standard is between 8 and 12 percent. In news articles and interviews we found price tags for the projects between $150 million and $350 million, so it’s likely that Coastal Construction did make millions. Thomas Murphy said that Coastal made the fair-market rate for building these projects. Our ruling Murphy said in an interview, ""We have never done business with Donald Trump."" Murphy’s family’s construction firm, Coastal Construction, built Trump condo projects in Hollywood and Sunny Isles Beach. The owners of the projects -- not Trump -- hired Coastal as the builder, and then separately the owners reached licensing agreements with Trump. So while Coastal built projects that carried Trump’s name, even boasting about it at least once, they didn’t directly strike a partnership together. But they did work on the same condo projects. We rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ec3b900e-4eaa-4ad0-8b92-8dcab035d162",/factchecks/2016/oct/26/patrick-murphy/patrick-murphy-says-his-family-never-did-business-/
"['Elections', 'Pennsylvania', 'John Rafferty']","
GOP Attorney General candidate can’t back up claim of widespread illegal voting in PA
","Correction appended Somehow, we’re still talking about whether or not voter fraud is widespread in Pennsylvania. And once again, we’ll repeat: Most studies and experts say it’s not. During a debate televised on 6ABC on Oct. 16, Republican candidate for Pennsylvania attorney general and state Sen. John Rafferty was in the process of bolstering his calls for a statewide voter ID provision when he implied ""illegal"" voting in Pennsylvania is widespread. ""Recently though, the media has reported on thousands of illegal voters here in the commonwealth,"" he said during the debate. His opponent, Democratic candidate and Montgomery County Commissioner Josh Shapiro, shot back ""That’s just simply not true"" to which Rafferty responded: ""Read the papers."" Concerns about voter fraud and illegal voting in Pennsylvania have been a major concern this election, especially as GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump has circulated factually inaccurate claims about voter fraud in Philadelphia. So we decided to check Rafferty’s claim. His campaign provided PolitiFact with three citations to back up his claim that the media has recently reported on ""thousands"" of instances of illegal voting in the commonwealth. The first wasa nearly two-year-old report in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, which reported that more than 700 Pennsylvanians may have cast two ballots or voted elsewhere in the 2012 general election. In that year, about six million votes were recorded in Pennsylvania, meaning those 700 votes would have accounted for less than 0.0001 percent of the vote. President Obama won the state by 300,000 votes. The story cited Carol Aichele, Pennsylvania’s former Secretary of State and a proponent of the implementation of voter ID laws. (She oversaw its passage in Pennsylvania and testified in the trial that ultimately led to the state Supreme Court ruling the measure unconstitutional.) At the time, Aichele told the newspaper that more than 700 Pennsylvania voters had the ""potential"" to cast two ballots in the election. Experts say double voting is actually quite rare. A report by the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law noted that accusations of widespread double voting are often couched with a ""might"" and are probably more common than actual double voting. ""These cases are extremely rare — not because such documentation is hard to come by (many states require that such documents be retained), but because actual double voting is itself extremely rare,"" author Justin Levitt wrote in the report. ""Moreover, the scarcity is expected, given the severity of the penalty (criminal prosecution), and the meager nature of the payoff (one incremental vote)."" The second media report cited by the Rafferty campaign was a January story by The Philadelphia Daily News about three former Philadelphia elections officials pleading guilty to violating the state election code. The story refers to two separate examples of voter fraud. The first was a case of a poll worker who cast a vote for her 23-year-old son in the 2015 primary. The second stemmed from the 2014 primary, in which the defendant voted for her mother. The final citation provided by the Rafferty campaign was a New York Times story detailing a fraud scheme in Philadelphia that encouraged hundreds of voters to cast absentee ballots even though they didn’t have a legal reason to. The story was from February 1994. Those examples don’t add up to ""recent"" media reports about thousands of voters casting illegal ballots in Pennsylvania. PolitiFact was able to find two additional media reports that did cite ""thousands"" of illegal voters in Pennsylvania. The first of those reports was an Oct. 11 report titled ""Potentially Thousands of Illegal Voters in Pennsylvania"" and was published by LifeZette, a website founded by conservative pundit Laura Ingraham. It cited an incident where mailers were sent to thousands of Pennsylvania voters — including, potentially, some undocumented immigrants — inviting residents to register to vote. It didn’t actually register them. The second report was published this week — notably after Rafferty made his claim during the 6ABC debate — and was titled: ""Proof: Thousands of GOP votes likely stolen in Pa."" It was published by WorldNetDaily, a conservative news and commentary website founded by Joseph Farah, a noted ""birther,"" or person who believes President Obama was not born in the United States. That story’s ""proof"" was a widely-debunked theory about 2012 voting in Philadelphia. Elections officials in Pennsylvania say widespread illegal voting is often cited during contentious elections and conversations about implementing voter ID requirements but isn’t particularly common. A 2012 report on voting irregularities in Philadelphia suggests most are a result of clerical errors. Our Ruling During a 6ABC debate, candidate for attorney general John Rafferty said ""Recently though, the media has reported on thousands of illegal voters here in the commonwealth."" To back up that claim, the campaign provided three citations: One of which was 22 years old and not recent, one that was related to instances of voter fraud that netted an additional two votes and one that suggested about 700 voters had the ""potential"" to vote twice, but there wasn’t evidence those individuals actually did. Those do not add up to the media ""recently"" reporting on ""thousands"" of instances of illegal voting. We rate the claim Pants on Fire. This article was corrected to reflect that in the 2012 general election 700 votes would have accounted for less than 0.01 percent of the vote.",/factchecks/2016/oct/26/john-rafferty/gop-attorney-general-candidate-cant-back-claim-wid/
"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Nathan Deal']","
Gov. Nathan Deal close on numbers about failing schools
","With early voting already underway, Georgia voters have an important decision to make besides president. A proposal, called Amendment 1, would allow the state to take over schools considered ""chronically failing."" Gov. Nathan Deal has led the charge to pass the statewide proposal, which has drawn criticism from community leaders and professional educators. At a recent education conference in Atlanta, Deal said, ""We have almost 68,000 Georgia students who are required by law to attend a chronically failing school."" PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look. We found the numbers are a little more complicated than they may seem. The Data An October poll showed likely voters siding nearly 2-1 against Amendment 1. Last month, a class-action lawsuit was filed against proponents of the bill, including Deal, over the language in the ""Opportunity School District"" ballot question. We reached out to Deal’s office and his spokesperson, Jen Talaber Ryan, sent us a PDF with the schools included on the chronically failing list, with the majority of the schools in the metro Atlanta area. Thing is, several of the schools included on the list, which was last updated in May, have closed or been consolidated this school year for a number of reasons. Deal says 68,000 students are required by law to attend a failing school. Students are in fact zoned for these schools, but options for private schools, charter schools and homeschooling exist. The 68,000 number is a sum of the enrollment at the near 130 schools eligible, as of May, to be taken over by the state if the amendment passes. (The maximum number of schools that could be in the district is 100.) The number is based off of last school year’s enrollment, but fails to account for about a dozen schools that closed or consolidated at the beginning of the 2016-2017 school year. In an email, GOSA spokesperson Martha Ann Todd said the total number of schools and enrollment for this school year would not be available until December. The amendment will be voted on in the Nov. 8 general election. A rough comparison of numbers by PolitiFact Georgia suggests a few thousand students would be unaffected by the takeover because their schools no longer exist. The issue Georgia schools have long been a contentious issue. About 60 percent of Georgia public school students are eligible for free and reduced lunch, a poverty measure used by the state department of education. This proposal would affect about 4 percent of Georgia public school students. Most OSD-eligible schools have more than 35 percent of students living in poverty. Deal has set out to reform poorly performing schools through this new district headed by a governor-appointed superintendent. Last year, the Republican-led Georgia Assembly passed a bill outlining the takeover of schools if they score below a number set by GOSA on a scale. Georgia uses the College & Career-Ready Performance Index, a 0-110 rating scale, to measure school performance. CCRPI uses standardized test scores, attendance, graduation rates and other measures to gauge academic proficiency. GOSA said scoring below a 60 is failing. Schools scoring below 60 three years in a row are ""chronically failing,"" and therefore could be taken over by the state if the amendment passes. The lawsuit, filed by a parent, a reverend and a teacher, against Deal, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and Secretary of State Brian Kemp calls the language in the ballot question is ""misleading"" and alleges there is no research to back up creation of a state-run district. Though some of these gains are limited, the opponents’ suit also says, ""the language describes the targeted schools as ‘failing’ while many of them have made as much or more progress on state school assessments as traditionally high performing schools."" Our Ruling Deal said there are, ""almost 68,000 Georgia students who are required by law to attend a chronically failing school."" We ran the numbers -- and he’s right. There are about 68,000 students in these failing schools. But his administration sets the standard, its numbers are out of date and there are other options. Opponents also claim some of these ""chronically failing"" schools have made gains in recent years. We rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/oct/26/nathan-deal/deal-close-numbers-about-failing-schools/

Russ Feingold: Ron Johnson has done essentially nothing on heroin and opioids
","Heroin and prescription painkillers were a topic in the second and final Wisconsin U.S. Senate debate on Oct. 18, 2016, three weeks before election day. It produced this exchange among Republican incumbent Ron Johnson, Democratic challenger Russ Feingold and moderator Mike Gousha. Johnson: ""I’ve been incredibly active on this. The fact that Senator Feingold attacked me, saying I’ve done nothing on this -- completely false. And quite honestly, a very disgusting false attack."" Feingold: ""I didn’t say he did nothing."" Gousha: ""There was a radio ad that said that Senator Johnson essentially did nothing."" Gousha was correct. A Feingold campaign radio ad released Sept. 6, 2016 says: ""Heroin addiction and opioid abuse are killing Wisconsin, and yet after six years in Washington, Sen. Ron Johnson has essentially done nothing."" Johnson pushed back by posting the video clip of the debate exchange on Twitter and with a digital ad responding to Feingold’s attack. So, let’s check the claim in the radio ad: In the six years since Johnson took Feingold’s seat in the 2010 election, has he ""essentially done nothing"" to fight heroin addiction and opioid abuse? Scope of the problem The lethal power of heroin and opioids (prescription painkillers such as oxycodone) has increasingly drawn the attention of politicians. Prince’s death in April 2016 from fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, led Republican Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel to claim that more people die in Wisconsin from all types of drug overdoses than car crashes. We rated that claim True. A couple of months later, when Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said ""we’re losing as many people to heroin and opioid overdoses as we lost to the AIDS epidemic at its peak,"" PolitiFact New York’s rating was Mostly False. Deaths directly caused by AIDS (43,115) were higher at their peak in 1995. Nevertheless, the latest data show 28,647 people across the country died from heroin and opioid overdoses in 2014, a figure that has been steadily climbing. Now let’s turn to Johnson. Johnson actions Johnson pushed back on Feingold’s claim partly because a nephew of Johnson’s died from a fentanyl overdose. (Initially, when Johnson revealed the death in March 2016, it was reported as a heroin overdose, but Johnson has since said it was fentanyl.) Here’s what Johnson’s campaign cited to us in terms of actions Johnson has taken: 1. Voted for the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which was approved almost unanimously in Congress before being signed into law by President Barack Obama in July 2016. Obama described the law as modest and complained that Republicans blocked an additional $920 million in funding supported by Democrats. But the law does authorize $181 million in new federal money for opioid and heroin abuse efforts. Moreover, the bill also makes policy changes in what the nonpartisan Pew Charitable Trusts described as the first ""multifaceted federal response to the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic."" 2. Introduced in April 2016 the Promoting Responsible Opioid Prescribing Act, which is aimed at reducing financial incentives for doctors who over-prescribe pain medications. The bill has been referred to a committee. 3. The same month, as chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government  Affairs Committee, held field hearings about the opioid problem in Pewaukee, Wis., and Cleveland, Ohio. He also held a hearing in Phoenix in November 2015 on ""America’s heroin epidemic at the border."" 4. Johnson also takes credit for a bipartisan investigation done by his committee. A report by the committee, which was disclosed in May 2016, found oversight problems at the Veterans Affairs facility in Tomah, Wis., where the prescription of painkillers to veterans has been under scrutiny.   Feingold's campaign has pointed to Johnson's votes against two amendments — the first for $1.1 billion to combat heroin addiction, the second for $600 million in emergency funding to fight the opioid crisis. More specifically, his campaign criticized Johnson for a no vote in June 2016 on a cloture motion (to limit debate). That motion was in regard to an amendment to a defense authorization bill that would have authorized $18 billion for various purposes, including $1.1 billion to fight heroin and opioid addiction. Johnson also voted no in March 2016 on a motion to ""waive all applicable budgetary discipline"" in order to make appropriations to fight the heroin and opioid problem, which the Feingold said would have provided $600 million. It’s fair to criticize Johnson for what he didn’t do -- but that wasn’t Feingold’s claim. Our rating Qualifying his claim only slightly, Feingold says Johnson ""has essentially done nothing"" to fight heroin addiction and opioid abuse. Johnson has voted for a major bill aimed at confronting the heroin-opioids problem, introduced a bill aimed at curbing overprescription of opioids and held Senate committee hearings on the problem. That’s more than nothing. We rate Feingold’s statement False.",/factchecks/2016/oct/26/russ-feingold/ron-johnson-has-done-essentially-nothing-heroin-an/

Donald Trump absurdly claims Clinton campaign chairman rigged the polls. Pants on Fire!
","Two weeks away from the Nov. 8 election, Donald Trump is behind in the polls. According to him, it’s because the Hillary Clinton campaign tampered with them. ""Wikileaks also shows how (Clinton campaign chairman) John Podesta rigged the polls by oversampling Democrats, a voter suppression technique,"" Trump said at a Oct. 24 rally in St. Augustine, Fla. ""And that’s happening to me all the time. When the polls are even, when they leave them alone and do them properly, I’m leading. But you see these polls, where they’re polling Democrats -- ‘how’s Trump doing’ ‘oh he’s down’ -- they’re polling Democrats!"" We were curious about Trump’s charge of bogus polling. Trump is wrong that Wikileaks shows Podesta rigging the polls against him. He’s referring to an email obtained by the hacker group from Clinton’s 2008 (not 2016) campaign on what appears to be internal polling (not public ones published by media organizations). And oversampling in this instance means polling more people in a specific demographic group for analysis -- not ignoring Republican voters to suppress their votes. In short, oversampling is a common polling technique and not, as Trump says, one of ""voter suppression.""  The email, one of thousands of Podesta emails released by Wikileaks, is a January 2008 exchange between Democratic strategists and employees of the Atlas Project, a political polling and data firm. Atlas sent over 98 pages of polling and media recommendations that includes several recommendations to oversample minorities, independent voters and Democrats in certain states. Experts told us the technical term for this is ""stratified disproportionate sampling,"" but most pollsters use ""oversample"" as a shorthand. It’s done not to skew the polls, but to gauge the attitudes of specific demographic groups, who would not be a statistically large enough group to analyze if sampled randomly. For example, in a national sample of 1,000 eligible voters, only 12.5 percent, or 125, would be black. To accurately gauge black attitudes on certain issues, a pollster may oversample 500 black eligible voters (four times more than the random sample). Then, in analyzing the full sample, the sample of blacks would be assigned a weight of 0.25 to represent the overall population. ""If the analysis of the group is done separately, it is simply a large sample of that group. If combined with all respondents the oversample is weighted down proportionately so that the overall sample is representative of the population as a whole,"" said Charles Franklin, the director of Marquette Law School Poll. ""This is a standard procedure and does not mean the weighted sample gives disproportionate weight to the oversampled group."" The Pew Research Center explained that it, for example, oversampled Hispanics for an in-depth look at the U.S. Hispanic population in June 2016. Analysts then weighted Hispanics when looking at the overall population to have both ""more precise estimates when looking at Hispanics specifically"" and also ""the correct distribution when looking at the sample as a whole."" Roger Tourangeau, president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, pointed out that monthly federal surveys on unemployment do the same. To get an accurate understanding of joblessness in Wyoming, pollsters would need to call a number of Wyoming residents disportionate to the number of people in the entire country. Trump’s overall charges of skewed polls is ""nonsense,"" Tourangeau said, ""Nobody wants to produce a biased assessment and look like an idiot (on Election Day). Why would people deliberately get it wrong? It’s business suicide."" Our ruling Trump said, ""Wikileaks also shows how John Podesta rigged the polls by oversampling Democrats, a voter suppression technique."" A leaked email shows the Clinton campaign of 2008 consulted data firm that suggest oversampling in what is likely internal polling. The term refers to a common technique used by pollsters to analyze demographics groups more precisely than possible in a random sample.

Is Trump the first-ever candidate not to say he'll accept election results?
","Politicians and commentators on both sides of the aisle have expressed shock at Donald Trump’s refusal to say he’ll accept the outcome of the Nov. 8 election. Many have said Trump’s comments, as well as his baseless accusations that the election is ""rigged,"" are unprecedented in modern politics. That includes his opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. ""During that debate, Donald said something — well, he said a lot of things that were troubling. But he said something truly horrifying: He became the first person running for president, Republican or Democrat, who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election,"" Clinton said at an Oct. 24 rally in New Hampshire. ""Now that is a direct threat to our democracy."" We wondered if Trump really is the first presidential candidate in American history who would not say that he’ll accept the election results. It’s difficult to prove a negative. But historians and experts in campaign rhetoric told us that while campaigns have challenged results after Election Day, they are unaware of any prior presidential candidate casting so much doubt about an election before it even happens. Before we get into the historical context, let’s take a quick look at Trump’s exact words from the final presidential debate Oct. 19. Moderator Chris Wallace asked Trump if he would ""absolutely accept the result of this election."" ""I will look at it at the time,"" Trump said. ""I'm not looking at anything now. I'll look at it at the time."" ""But, sir,"" Wallace said, ""there is a tradition in this country — in fact, one of the prides of this country — is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner. Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?"" Trump responded, ""What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense. Okay?"" The fact that Trump has to answer a question like this is a first, said Tammy Vigil, a Boston University professor who researches campaign rhetoric. There’s no precedent for a major party candidate being so publicly skeptical of an upcoming election. ""Most major party candidates do not make contesting the results an issue; it is simply assumed that they will accept the outcome of the vote,"" Vigil said. ""For that reason few candidates are ever asked the question in as direct a manner as Trump was asked it in the debate. The fact of him having to answer a direct query makes it unusual, and so his answer is unusual."" Historical context Trump is certainly not the first candidate in recent memory to question whether there will be voter fraud. In 2008, Republican nominee John McCain said the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, Acorn, was ""on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy."" McCain's statement and others like it, though, are not equivalent to saying they might not accept the final results. Historians pointed out several examples of elections in the 19th and 20th centuries when the popular vote or electoral college vote was so close that the final results were controversial. But in none of those cases did the presidential candidate challenge the election before it took happened. Take the most recent example: the 2000 election between George W. Bush and Al Gore, the results of which eventually came down in a Supreme Court decision. In that case, it wasn’t until after Election Day that Gore requested the recount in Florida. After an exceptionally close race between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy in 1960, some Republicans called for a recount, but Nixon distanced himself from them. In the 1800s, several elections fell into the hands of Congress. In those cases, the political parties questioned whether the final results — not the popular vote but the pending congressional decisions — would be legitimate, said Alex Keyssar, a Harvard University professor and expert in voting history. However, he added that the candidates themselves did not question the legitimacy of the outcome before the election took place. And eventually, they conceded, said Brian Rosenwald, a fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. ""Even in 1800, 1824 and 1876, where resolutions took almost until Inauguration Day, we had an outcome accepted, if grudgingly and with concessions, from both parties,"" Rosenwald said. ""People on the losing sides in these elections, as well as 1960 and 2000, often went to their graves believing that they’d had an election stolen from them, but they didn’t move to start or encourage a rebellion."" Also notable is the 1860 race. In the lead-up to that election, politicians in several southern states plotted to secede if Abraham Lincoln were to win, said Daniel Feller, a professor of mid 19th century history at the University of Tennessee. Lincoln won, the southern states seceded, and the country descended into civil war. But none of the four presidential candidates that year advocated on the campaign trail for secession if Lincoln were to win, Feller said. Additionally, the South viewed the election results as legitimate and as confirmation that the northern states wanted to stifle their way of life. ""Have other presidential candidates announced beforehand they would not accept the results of the election? Not to my knowledge,"" Feller said. ""But has there been a case when enough Americans rejected the results of the election to disrupt the system? Yes."" Our ruling Clinton said Trump is ""the first person running for president, Republican or Democrat, who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election."" There are examples of presidential campaigns challenging elections or raising concerns about corruption after Election Day. But historians and experts cannot point to an example of a presidential candidate himself refusing to say he would accept the results before the election even happens. We couldn't find one, either.  If an example of a past presidential candidate saying something equivalent to Trump comes up, or if we find additional information to support Clinton's claim, we’ll update our story. But with the information we have available, for now we rate Clinton’s claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/075ca508-d586-4024-b79e-5c4d637ae144",/factchecks/2016/oct/25/hillary-clinton/trump-first-ever-candidate-not-say-hell-accept-ele/

Hillary Clinton exaggerates by saying Donald Trump plans to deport 16 million people
","Donald Trump may be the highest-profile tweeter in political history, but Hillary Clinton isn’t averse to attacking her opponent via Twitter, either. On Oct. 23, Clinton's campaign account tweeted, ""Donald Trump says he'd deport 16 million people. How do you even begin to quantify that?"" Attached to the tweet was a short video that offered a comparison of how many sports stadiums would be needed to accommodate 16 million people. (Spoiler alert: It’s larger than the number of pro sports stadiums in the United States -- by a lot.) Donald Trump says he'd deport 16 million people. How do you even begin to quantify that? pic.twitter.com/Fu1aBQrZag   But how accurate is Clinton’s statement that Trump ""says he'd deport 16 million people""? That’s less clear. For starters, we’ll note that Trump has not used the 16 million figure himself in referring to the number of deportations he would oversee as president. Indeed, the Trump campaign tells PolitiFact that they consider the 16 million number to be incorrect. ""Mr. Trump’s plan does not call for deporting 16 million,"" said Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung. ""It says we will deal with those who are not priorities at a later date."" So where does it come from? We’ve looked at this issue in an earlier fact-check of a statement by Tim Kaine. The 16 million tally includes two groups of people: those who are in the country illegally (about 11 million) and the U.S.-born children of undocumented parents (about 4.5 million, according to Pew Research Center). Combined, that’s not quite 16 million, but it’s reasonably close. However, even Trump in recent months has backed away from policies that would make the 11 million figure accurate -- and the evidence for the additional 4.5 million figure is in question, too. Let’s take a closer look. The 11 million figure Complicating this fact-check is that Trump has not been consistent on immigration throughout his campaign. Leading up to the primaries, Trump said he wanted undocumented families to stay together, but ""they have to go."" In a September 2015 interview on 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley asked Trump what he would do with 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally. ""If they've done well, they're going out, and they're coming back in legally ... We're rounding 'em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way,"" Trump said. In November 2015, a day after one of the Republican primary debates, Joe Scarborough of MSNBC asked Trump, ""How do you deport 12 million illegal immigrants?"" ""You do it. You do it. Because they're here illegally, you do it,"" Trump responded. In that same interview, he said, ""you’re going to have a deportation force, and you’re going to do it humanely."" All of this suggests that Trump did want to deport 11 million people who are in the United States illegally. But that was the old version of Trump’s plan.   Trump refined his immigration plan a year later, in a major speech on Aug. 31 in Arizona. In that 10-point speech, he reiterated get tough measures, but he also suggested not everyone would be deported. Trump started by talking about criminals, saying there would be ""zero tolerance for criminal aliens."" He said his administration would begin moving them out ""Day One,"" working especially with police and law enforcement who ""know who these people are."" His fifth point centered on the enforcement of all immigration laws. The Clinton campaign highlighted this part of the speech to back up Clinton’s debate comments. ""In a Trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced ... As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement. And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done. Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country."" But Trump also gave another mixed message within the same speech. He said that after accomplishing enforcement and deportation goals, after building a wall, ending illegal immigration and establishing a new lawful immigration system, ""then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain."" That suggests that while every undocumented person could potentially be deported (""subject to deportation""), they won’t all be deported. Put it all together and you have evidence from a year ago that Trump would deport the estimated 11 million people who are in the United States illegally, but less support for that conclusion in his more recent comments. That’s a problem for Clinton’s tweet, which said that Trump ""says"" -- present tense -- that ""he'd deport 16 million people"" The 4.5 million figure It’s only possible to get near 16 million if you include the deportation of people who were born in the United States to parents who were in the country illegally. What has Trump said about that? Some background: The 14th Amendment established birthright citizenship says ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."" That clause of the amendment is widely understood to mean that everyone born on U.S. soil is automatically an American citizen, despite parents’ immigration status. Trump hasn’t talked about birthright citizenship and ""anchor babies"" much since the heyday of the GOP primary. In November 2015, Trump said a constitutional amendment would not be needed to deal with the citizenship of children born in the United States to undocumented parents. ""You need an act of Congress. You don't have to go through a new amendment or anything, a new constitutional amendment,"" Trump said November 2015 in an MSNBC interview. ""But anchor babies. A woman is pregnant; she goes over to the border, has a baby on our land, now we take care of the baby for the next 85 years."" Trump also said several times in 2015 that he does not think citizenship should have been granted to people with undocumented parents. The Clinton campaign points to an August 2015 exchange between Trump and host Bill O'Reilly, who asked, ""Illegal immigrant mother and father living in Los Angeles, two children who are American citizens, born here.  If you're president do you order authorities to take that family into custody?"" Trump answered, ""We have no choice. I'm sorry, Bill. We have to bring them out."" Trump's responses to similar questions were also vague. In another August 2015 interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo, he said undocumented parents would have to leave and unless they were ""bad"" parents they would take their baby with citizenship with them. And in a town hall with Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Aug. 25, 2016, Trump was asked, ""No birthright citizenship, correct?"" Trump replied, ""Right."" Trump’s campaign has not clarified his current position on birthright citizenship. His call for an end to birthright citizenship is no longer prominently featured in the immigration reform section of Trump’s campaign website. But even if it were accurate to say that Trump supports a change in birthright citizenship -- something he has not been consistent about -- he would still need to to strip citizenship from those who already have it, and then deport them. And that would invite even more legal challenges than trying to remove or alter the 14th Amendment. ""Such a retroactive statute would clearly be far more controversial than merely changing the rules prospectively,"" David A. Martin, an immigration, constitutional law and international law scholar and professor emeritus at the University of Virginia School of Law, previously told PolitiFact. So, getting to 16 million requires believing that, first, Trump supports revoking birthright citizenship for those who already have it; second, that he could enact it despite substantial constitutional hurdles; and third, that he would then proceed to deport all 4.5 people who fall into that category. That’s a lot of what-ifs. Our ruling Clinton tweeted, ""Donald Trump says he'd deport 16 million people."" While Trump has certainly offered his share of hard-line stances on immigration, Clinton’s comment exaggerates his position in several ways. First, Trump didn’t use the 16 million figure himself. Second, while Clinton phrases her tweet in the present tense, her case is weaker now than it would have been a year ago, based on what Trump has said and posted on his website in recent months. Finally, counting the last 4.5 million people needed to get within shouting distance of Clinton’s 16 million figure requires an unlikely cascade of events that Trump’s campaign today says he isn’t seeking to set off. We rate the statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0544b157-373e-4862-9b6b-0dee1187bf16",/factchecks/2016/oct/25/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-exaggerates-saying-donald-trump-pl/

Tobacco industry misleads in Prop 56 'doctor advertisement'
","Opponents of Proposition 56, California’s proposed tobacco tax increase, have raised more than $66 million to defeat the November ballot measure. Nearly all of that money has come from the tobacco industry and much of it has been spent on television ads criticizing the initiative. Supporters have raised nearly $30 million for it.  Prop 56 would impose a $2 per pack tax increase on cigarettes statewide and fund health programs. A recent No on 56 TV ad features a retired doctor who makes a provocative claim about how the measure’s revenue would be spent: ""Prop 56 diverts 82 percent of the new taxes to line the pockets of wealthy special interests like insurance companies who don't have to help even one more patient,"" says Amador County Dr. Arnold Zeiderman, who appears in the ad wearing a white coat and stethoscope. Would the measure really distribute the bulk of the revenue to ""wealthy special interests"" with no mandate to serve more patients? We decided to check the facts. Our research The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office expects Prop 56 could generate up to $1.4 billion in tax revenue in its first year. A chunk of that would go to replacing losses to state tobacco funds that would likely see a dip if cigarette sales decline due to the tax increase. Five percent would be spent to administer the tax. And about $120 million would go to various state programs, from law enforcement to physician training to dental disease prevention. The LAO report says 82 percent of the remaining revenue -- anywhere from $700 million to $1 billion -- would be spent to ""increase the level of payment for healthcare, services and treatment provided to Medi-Cal beneficiaries."" Medi-Cal provides health care for the state’s poorest residents. Health advocates have long argued the program’s reimbursement rates are too low to retain and attract doctors.  Charles Rex Arbogast /AP file photo Expanding patient access? Supporters of Prop 56 say boosting reimbursement rates will lead to more doctors serving more Medi-Cal patients -- which runs against the implication in the ad that the measure won’t help ""even one more patient."" Scott Graves of the California Budget and Policy Center examined Prop 56 and concluded on the center’s website: ""Increasing Medi-Cal reimbursement rates would help to boost providers’ participation in the program and help ensure timely access to care — and possibly improved health outcomes — for the more than 13 million low-income Californians who rely on Medi-Cal to meet their health care needs."" The policy center is a nonprofit that advocates for programs aimed at low-income families. A spokeswoman for the No on 56 campaign acknowledged that 82 percent of the measure’s revenue would be set aside for increasing reimbursement rates. But the No campaign also said the measure does nothing to require more Medi-Cal patients are served. Supporters say that point is technically correct but distorts the point of the measure. ""We made a determination that it would be better to dedicate money to Medi-Cal broadly rather than setting an arbitrary formula,"" said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, the consumer advocacy group that helped draft Prop 56. ""The idea that this would help not even one new patient is sort of absurd. ... They're playing a little bit of a word game there."" ‘Misleading’ ad Manoj Viswanathan, a UC Hastings law professor who focuses on tax policy and has studied Proposition 56, described the No campaign’s advertisement as ""misleading."" The professor, who is not affiliated with either side, said the No campaign appears to rest the second portion of the claim by the retired doctor -- the idea that Medi-Cal providers ""don't have to help even one more patient"" -- on an ""unlikely"" scenario. ""Is there a universe where doctors see the exact same patients that they would have seen anyway, but are just getting paid more? Sure. I think that is a mathematical possibility. It just seems unlikely,"" Viswanathan said. According to the LAO, the California State Auditor would conduct audits of agencies receiving funds from the new taxes at least every other year. The Sacramento Bee examined claims by No on 56, and found questionable its description of Medi-Cal providers as ""wealthy special interests."" It notes those providers are ""doctors, clinics, hospitals, managed care plans and any other health-related group that get Medi-Cal payments because they provide services to eligible patients."" Our ruling A recent No on 56 campaign ad claims: ""Prop 56 diverts 82 percent of the new taxes to line the pockets of wealthy special interests like insurance companies who don't have to help even one more patient."" The Legislative Analyst’s Office reported that 82 percent of revenue generated by the measure, after some is directed to other funds, would be spent to ""increase the level of payment for healthcare, services and treatment provided to Medi-Cal beneficiaries."" Experts who have examined Prop 56 say there’s a strong chance that higher reimbursement rates will attract more doctors and expand health care access for patients. There’s the smallest sliver of truth to the No on 56 campaign’s claim that providers ""don’t have to help even one more patient"" because the measure does not dictate how many new patients will be served. But the claim also asks one to suspend reality by believing no new doctors would be attracted by the higher rates and that current doctors would not add more patients. Even the addition of handful of new doctors would expand healthcare access, shooting down the campaign’s misleading statement. We rated its claim Mostly False.

Testing Gary Johnson claim that he is only candidate in favor of free trade
","Amid a presidential election that seems to grow stranger every day, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is looking to stand out the old-fashioned way: with good, clean political claims. Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico, appeared on UpFront with Mike Gousha, a public affairs show on WISN-TV (Channel 12), when he stopped in Milwaukee in early September. Responding to a question about how his platform might appeal to a Republican voter, Johnson rattled off a minute-long list of values ranging from honesty to low taxes to limited government. ""We’re the only candidates that do believe in free trade,"" he told Gousha midway through, referring to his himself and his running mate, Bill Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts. Free trade — the ability to import and export products among countries without restrictions such as taxes and tariffs — has been a hot topic this cycle. While it is an example of limited government intervention, which conservative voters tend to favor, critics say unfettered competition sends domestic jobs to countries with lower wages. The issue of trade came up in each of the three presidential debates — though Johnson’s poll numbers didn’t earn him a spot on the stage with Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. So, do Johnson and Weld stand alone in support of free trade? Trading positions Let’s start with Johnson’s own position. Over the course of the campaign, he and Weld have both said several times they’re the only candidates who believe in free trade. Specifically, they have voiced support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a far-reaching free trade deal between 12 countries that was finalized and signed by President Barack Obama in February but has yet to be voted on by Congress. John Vaught LaBeaume, a spokesman for Johnson’s campaign, referred us to a Ballotpedia overview of each candidate’s position on the TPP to support Johnson’s claim that he and Weld are the only candidates who support free trade. While a collection of quotes shows Johnson has embraced the TPP, in June, Johnson questioned whether or not he would have signed the TPP while speaking to Politico’s Glenn Thrush. ""Would I have signed or implemented the Trans-Pacific Partnership?"" he said in the June 6, 2016 podcast. ""I've got to tell you, I think it's laden with crony capitalism."" Three months later, when speaking to Gousha in Milwaukee, Johnson suggested that his view that political favors are tied in to free trade agreements is similar to that of many Americans. ""The aversion that we have to these trade agreements is that they are laced with favoritism,"" he said. Despite the issues, Johnson says he would sign the TPP. Clinton and Trump Clinton has had her own change of heart when it comes to free trade agreements. She praised the North American Free Trade Agreement finalized during her husband’s presidency — only to criticize it while running for president herself in 2008. PolitiFact verified the switch at the time. And in 2012, she famously called the TPP ""the gold standard"" of trade deals while serving as Secretary of State — before flipping entirely. At a Democratic primary debate last October, she said that after absorbing new information, she determined the TPP did not meet her standards and she now opposed it. As a senator, she had the opportunity to vote on 10 free trade deals, though none as sizable as NAFTA or the TPP. She voted in favor of six. Two other deals she supported but missed the votes. The final two she voted against. PolitiFact previously broke down her votes. So, Clinton has supported such trade deals in at least some of the cases. Republican nominee Donald Trump’s position has been equally conflicting. He has floated the idea of tariffs, as PolitiFact has previously examined, which is not in line with free trade positions. In July, he railed against the TPP: ""The Trans-Pacific Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country — just a continuing rape of our country. It’s a harsh word, but it’s true."" Much like Clinton, Trump has voiced support of free trade while criticizing current free trade deals. In the final presidential debate, he said if elected, he would support free trade deals but re-negotiate them. ""We'll have more free trade than we have right now, but we have horrible deals,"" he said. Finally, Green Party candidate Jill Stein has a clear track record of opposing free trade agreements including the TPP and NAFTA. In 2015, she released a video called ""Flush the TPP"" in which she characterized the agreement as a ""backroom deal"" that ""gives corporations more power than nations."" Our rating Johnson said he and his running mate were the only candidates who support free trade. While his statement has truth to it — they are the only candidates supporting the largest free trade agreement currently on the table — Clinton and Trump say they support the idea of free trade deals if executed to their liking. Clinton supported NAFTA and in the Senate voted for several smaller trade deals. For a partially accurate statement that leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.",/factchecks/2016/oct/25/gary-johnson/testing-gary-johnson-claim-he-only-candidate-favor/
"['Virginia', 'Levar Stoney']","
Levar Stoney says he oversaw 300 paid workers at Va. Democratic Party
","Levar Stoney, a 35-year-old political operative running for Richmond mayor, was asked at a recent debate if he has the managerial chops to lead the city. ""We know you served as head of the Democratic Party (of Virginia) and as secretary of the commonwealth,"" said Craig Carper, news director for WCVE Public Radio. ""How do these skills translate to an executive position like mayor? How many people did you manage in these positions?"" Stoney replied, ""Well, when I was executive director of the Democratic Party, I was able to run the day-to-day operations of a multi-million dollar organization, a multi-million dollar operation that featured 300 people on my payroll in the year 2008."" There’s no doubt that millions of dollars were running in and out of the Democratic Party of Virginia in 2008, when Barack Obama was first elected president and carried Virgina, a key swing state. Federal Election Commission reports show the state party spent nearly $17 million that year, much of it coming from national Democratic campaign sources. What caught our attention is Stoney’s statement that there were ""300 people on my payroll"" that year. Our experience is that you can often count the state party’s staffers on your fingers. Filings with the Federal Election Commission show that when Stoney became executive director that February, the party had a paid staff of 11.  The number remained constant in March and increased to 16 in April and May. Then the numbers began to surge. The party, by our count, listed 51 people on its payroll in June, 140 in July, 238 in August and 298 in September. Matt Corridoni, a spokesman for Stoney, sent us a copy of the party’s report covering the almost six-week period from Oct. 16, 2008 to Nov. 24. We counted 301 people listed as ""payroll"" employees. Who were these people and what did they do? Corridoni said most of them were young people, fresh out of college or taking a break from their studies, who worked on a field staff to help Obama win Virginia. They fanned out to campaign offices across the state to reach out to voters, stage local campaign events and organize get-out-the-vote efforts. About half of the workers were from Virginia, the rest came from all over the country. The field staff was funded by millions of dollars pumped into the state party by the Democratic National Committee and Obama’s campaign. The staff’s activities, Stoney told us, were jointly coordinated by those national entities and the state party. Stoney said he didn’t have a personal hand in much of the hiring but, as executive director of the state party, had ""the final sign off"" on who came aboard. He said he worked with the national campaign to establish goals for the field staff and assigned mid-level managers at the party to supervise the daily work. ""I was executive director of the party, so I was responsible for ensuring all these people got paid,"" Stoney said. He said he and others spent a lot of time finding homes for the workers and that he traveled the state ""rallying and galvanizing"" them. ""We were given a task at the beginning of the year that Virginia would be a battleground in the election and you need to get people on the ground,"" Stoney said. He added that he carried out the mission and it helped Obama become the first Democratic presidential candidate in 44 years to win Virginia. In December 2008, with the presidential election in the books, the state party’s payroll fell to eight people. A final note: Stoney also was asked at the debate how many people he supervised when he was secretary of the commonwealth from 2014 until this April. He didn’t provide an answer, but we will. The state budget provided funding for 17 employees in the office, including Stoney, for the fiscal year that ended on June 30. The secretary of the commonwealth helps the governor make nearly 4,000 appointments to state boards and commissions. Among other duties, the secretary also helps the governor process restoration of rights requests from felons who have completed their sentences and keeps records on state lobbyists. Our ruling Asked how many people he supervised as executive director of the state Democratic Party, Stoney said ""there were 300 people on my payroll in 2008."" Records show the state party’s payroll did hit 300 that fall as it hired temporary field workers to help Obama’s presidential campaign in Virginia. It was a massive effort coordinated by the state party, the Democratic National Committee and Obama’s campaign. The caveat is that there were 11 people on the payroll in February 2008 when Stoney became executive director and that didn’t begin to significantly rise until June. And in December, when the election was history, the party’s payroll shrank to eight. So the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

"['Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'Texas', 'David Holmes']","
David Holmes says Gerald Daugherty advocated lighter penalty for certain strangulation cases
","The Democratic challenger in a Travis County commissioner race says incumbent Republican Gerald Daugherty has urged a reduction in penalties tied to strangulation attempts in domestic violence attacks. David Holmes, a mediator and former legislative aide seeking to represent Precinct 3 covering western parts of the county, said in an Oct. 17, 2016, Facebook post: ""Strangulation family violence crimes have arisen as an issue in my campaign for county commissioner after my opponent advocated lowering the penalty for such crimes because,"" Holmes wrote, ""they just, ‘throw more people into the system.’"" For this fact check, we reviewed the original video from a May 26, 2016, work session where Daugherty made a statement about the county possibly asking state lawmakers to re-classify strangulation to a misdemeanor from a felony. Holmes didn’t provide nor did we find other indications of Daugherty otherwise exploring or pushing for the change. In his Facebook post, Holmes urged viewers to watch and share an accompanying video he made that shows Daugherty saying at the work session: ""Now strangulation, you know, is a definition that throws more people into the system. I mean, and I don’t know whether, you know, we need to be at the Legislature going, ‘don’t put strangulation as a damn felony,’ I mean, you know, because, you know, that just raises the numbers.""  SOURCE: Video posted on Facebook by David Holmes, Oct. 17, 2016 (screenshot) We learned more about the context of Daugherty’s comments by watching the county’s posted video of the session. It shows Daugherty piping up after the commissioners court heard criminal justice officials describe factors behind a 13 percent, 299-person uptick in the county’s jail population from May 2014 to May 2016. Addressing the commissioners court, members of the county’s Jail Population Monitoring Group, consisting of county justice planning, criminal courts and pretrial service administrators, cited as factors increases in felony family violence charges as well as bookings of individuals with mental disabilities. Carsten Andresen, one of the administrators, told the commissioners court that an enhanced form had helped authorities build domestic violence cases--resulting in more felony charges since 2014. To our inquiry, Kelsey McKay, a Travis County prosecutor, said by phone the county in 2014 added questions to the Travis County Sheriff’s Office strangulation supplement form to improve evidence-gathering about suspected abusers. Before that, McKay advised, the 2009 Legislature revised Title 5, Chapter 22 of the state penal code to make it a third-degree felony rather than a Class A misdemeanor if a family member, household member or significant other of a victim is ""recklessly impeding the normal breathing or circulation of the blood of the person by applying pressure to the person’s throat or neck or by blocking the person’s nose or mouth."" About an hour and 10 minutes into the work session, Daugherty expressed frustration at the jail population statistics presented before asking the monitoring group about how the group is organized. In our transcript below, we’ve bolded the Daugherty comments noted by Holmes: ""If you have a committee and you don’t have a chairman and you don’t have a charge - how often do you meet? ""Once a month? Is there soon to be a report that comes back saying ‘here are the things we can absolutely do,’ because I think these stats are great, but they’re a frustrating thing for all of us. ""I know y’all look at this and say, ‘These are ridiculous.’ We need two new courts, and we continue to throw money at things and if it’s not the Michael Morton thing coming at us, it’s the DNA thing coming at us, it’s the numbers, it’s the now strangulation, you know, is a definition that throws more people into the system. I mean, and I don’t know whether, you know, we need to be at the Legislature going, ‘Don’t put strangulation as a damn felony,’ I mean, you know, because, you know, that just raises the numbers."" Daugherty went on to refer to the county’s justice planning manager, Kimberly Pierce, saying: ""Y’all, I mean, what I’m interested in -- I’m fine to have this stuff, but I hate to have to try to look even somewhat knowledgeable about something when Kim has forgotten more about this mess than I’ll ever know in my life. I need somebody that can take charge of something and my goal is to do something about the costs that we have in this community."" No other indications When we asked Daugherty if he’d advocated going to lawmakers to reduce the penalty for strangulation in instances of family or intimate partner violence, he said he did not. By phone, he said: ""Some of these statistics happen where there’s a definition change. I will tell you, if you are strangling somebody, then, by God, that ought to be a felony. It should have been a felony forever."" Days after we made our initial inquiry, Daugherty brought up strangulation during the Oct. 18 commissioners court meeting during discussion of a request from Travis County Criminal Courts for three new district courts, saying: ""I’m not going to say anything about strangulation, because I had one of the judges come over to me and (say) ‘Gerald, the way you expressed yourself, it was kind of like you weren’t sympathetic to people that were getting strangled,’ and I said ‘that’s the furthest thing from what I meant,’ I mean, you know, I think strangulation should be a felony, I mean, if that’s what you’re doing to someone."" In a follow-up phone call to Daugherty, he said he’d done nothing to further investigate lessening the penalty or sent any such communication to any county official to that effect. Sarah Eckhardt, the Democratic county judge who heads the commissioners court, declined to comment on whether Daugherty has advocated as Holmes said. Separately to our inquiry, Deece Eckstein, who coordinates the county’s intergovernmental relations, said reducing the strangulation penalty wasn’t part of the county’s agenda relating to the legislative session beginning in January 2017. ""It’s not on the agenda and there has not been any formal"" or informal ""suggestion to put it on the agenda,"" Eckstein said by phone. We also followed up with Holmes, who didn’t offer other signs of Daugherty advocating the described change in law. ""Because I understand the problem, you’d never hear me -- or likely anyone else on the court -- jump during a discussion to the idea that we might need to go to the Legislature to get the penalty lowered,"" Holmes said by email. Our ruling Holmes said Daugherty advocated lowering the penalty for crimes like strangulation in domestic violence cases because ""they just ‘throw more people into the’"" jail ""‘system.’"" Addressing staff members, Daugherty appeared to be seeking input on a variety of issues affecting the costs of operating the jail. Among the questions he raised was whether the county should argue for a lowering of the penalty for strangulation. Yet Daugherty didn’t advocate for that action either in his comment at the work session or in any statement or action since, far as we can tell. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Gerald Daugherty touts his own pay decreases. His pay went down--once.
","An Austin Republican who talks up affordability says he's also repeatedly taken pay cuts. Really? Gerald Daugherty’s campaign website says: ""Leading by example, he has also taken an 8% pay decrease in each of the nine years he has been in office."" That’s nine years in two chunks: Daugherty, a businessman, recaptured the Precinct 3 post on the Travis County Commissioners Court, representing western Travis County, in 2012 after losing the spot to a Democratic challenger in 2008. He faces Democrat David Holmes, a mediator, on the November 2016 ballot. Confirmed: Daugherty's smaller raises Earlier this year, we found Mostly False a candidate’s claim that Daugherty had voted to raise his 2016 salary 19.6 percent. Daugherty had voted to adopt the county budget including pay raises for the four commissioners. Separately, though, he set his own increased salary at $93,000, which was $8,400 less than what the budget authorized for commissioners. For 2016 then, Daugherty’s pay went up 3.2 percent from his 2015 salary of $90,109. For that fact check, we also confirmed that while the county’s 2015 budget provided for each of the commissioners to be paid $98,463, Daugherty was actually paid $90,109 that year, or 8.5 percent less than his colleagues, according to the county’s 2015 actual expenditures data. We also found that earlier, after Daugherty rejoined the body in 2013, he accepted a salary of $90,109 for fiscal 2013, according to his signed affidavit. At the time, that was about 5.7 percent less than the budgeted salary for each commissioner. Pay cuts every year? For this fact check, we wondered about the claim on Daugherty’s campaign site that he’s taken an 8 percent pay cut every year on the court. Asked to explain his claim, Daugherty said by phone that each time that he voted for annual county budgets including pay raises for commissioners, he followed up by directing the county to give him less of a raise. ""We make $103,000 this year, and I’ve elected to take $93,000, which is probably more than 8 percent"" less, Daugherty said. ""What I do is, each year I take somewhere -- at least 8 percent"" less. Daugherty added: ""I have never voted to give myself a raise."" Hold that thought: Daugherty may not have voted for pay raises but he’s accepted them--albeit in smaller increments than his colleagues. Also, records we obtained from the county’s archival budget documents covering county fiscal years that begin in October of each preceding year mostly indicate he’s not demanded actual pay cuts. The specifics: In 2003, when Daugherty won a special election to succeed Margaret Moore on the court, the salary for the Precinct 3 commissioner had already been set at $67,570, or 9.39 percent less than the court’s adopted salary for that fiscal year of $73,915. In 2004, Daugherty’s salary shrunk to $66,523, for a 1.55 percent decrease. Our review indicates that was the only time Daugherty’s salary went down from his previous year’s pay during his stints on the court. Records show Daugherty’s salary stayed the same for 2005 before increasing by 2 percent, to $67,854, for 2006. For 2007, Daugherty’s salary went up 13.29 percent, to $76,872 and for 2008, his pay increased by 3.4 percent, to $79,562 though a few months into that fiscal year, Daugherty relinquished his seat to Democrat Karen Huber, who defeated him at the polls. When Daugherty returned to the court in 2013, he elected to keep his salary at what Huber had been fielding, $90,109, through fiscal 2015. This gets us to the years we covered in the previous fact check. We also analyzed Daugherty’s claim by his reasoning -- the idea that every year he’s served, he’s made sure to be paid 8 percent less than other commissioners. That holds up for each year of his interrupted tenure, we confirmed, with the exception of the year he returned to the court, fiscal 2013. That year, Daugherty’s salary was 5.74 percent less than the court’s adopted salary for commissioners. By phone, Daugherty disputed the notion that he’d said on his campaign site that every year he took an 8 percent pay cut. ""I guess you can read it however you want; I think it’s pretty straightforward,"" Daugherty said. ""Each year whatever the salary is, I take, on average, 8 percent less than that … some of this stuff you have to put in a bumper sticker kind of a size. You can get so verbose with it and get people so confused about ‘what the hell is he saying?’ ""I don’t think it’s difficult to understand,"" Daugherty said. ""If people say, ‘tell me what you mean by that,’ well, the salary for 2016 and 2017 is $103,000. I’ve signed an affidavit that I only want to be paid $93,000. And that’s greater than 8 percent"" less, he said. Our ruling Daugherty says on his campaign site that he’s ""taken an 8% pay decrease in each of the nine years he has been in office."" As a commissioner, Daugherty took a pay cut once. In fiscal 2004, his salary went down 1.55 percent to $66,523. Daugherty also has consistently taken steps to ensure he’s paid 8 percent less than fellow commissioners each year, though in one year his pay ran about 6 percent behind. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Obama attaches stark terms to possible Supreme Court ruling on health care law
","
After remaining mostly silent on the topic, President Barack Obama stepped into the debate over how the Supreme Court might rule on the health care law, the signature legislation of his presidency.

In a Rose Garden press conference on April 2, 2012, the president expressed confidence that the nine justices will uphold the law and said that to do otherwise would be an example of ""judicial activism"" so often maligned by Republicans. He listed some benefits of the law that have already taken effect -- drug discounts for Medicare beneficiaries and millions of children gaining coverage.

""So there's -- there's not only an economic element and a legal element to this, but there's a human element to this. And I hope that's not forgotten in this political debate.

""Ultimately, I'm confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress,"" he said.

Two terms stood out to us in that statement: ""strong majority"" and ""unprecedented.""

Is Obama, a Harvard Law-educated president, correct in his characterization of how the bill passed Congress? We remembered the vote as quite narrow. And what about the historical implication of overturning it?

First, ‘strong majority’

For this part of the claim, we turned to the congressional record of votes on the health care bill from late 2009 and early 2010.

The health law took an unusual path to passage. Usually, the House and Senate pass different versions of a bill, then they work out their differences in a conference committee. A unified bill comes out of that committee, and both bodies vote again on the new bill. Then, if it passes, the president signs it.
   
In the case of the health care bill, the House and Senate had each passed different versions in 2009. It was expected the two bills would be integrated in conference committee, then voted on again. But before that could happen, the Democrats lost their 60-seat, filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. (Republican Scott Brown in January 2010 won the seat formerly held by the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.) Anything that came out of conference committee at that point could have been held up in the Senate, blocked by 40 Republican senators.
   
Democrats decided to get around this by having the House simply accept the Senate’s version of the bill. Then Democrats in the House and Senate used a different measure -- a reconciliation bill, which requires only a simple majority -- to modify the law they had just passed.

The vote to pass the Senate version of the bill had been 60-39.

The bill passed the House 219-212 on March 21,2010.

Numerically speaking, neither vote reflects a very large margin of victory. In the Senate, 60 votes was actually the exact minimum needed to prevent a filibuster -- not a vote more. And in both chambers, not a single Republican voted for for the bill.

The notion of ‘unprecedented’

This one, we’ll acknowledge, puzzled us.

The Supreme Court routinely reviews laws passed by Congress and either upholds or overturns them. For Obama to suggest that such an action would be unique in American history is something of a head-scratcher.

We could name numerous examples of the Supreme Court tossing laws passed by a ""democratically elected Congress,"" starting with Marbury vs. Madison, in 1803.

For a more recent example, Senate historian Don Ritchie cited the 1990 Gun-Free School Zones Act, which made it a federal offense to knowingly possess a firearm in a school zone. But in United States vs. Lopez, the court said the federal government could not use the commerce clause to restrict guns.

""Lots of laws have been overturned,"" Ritchie said. ""That’s what the Supreme Court does.""

Eugene Volokh, a law professor at University of California at Los Angeles and blogger who considers himself center-right or libertarian-conservative, even cited a case that was passed by a large majority in Congress and then tossed out by the court.

The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 passed unanimously in the House and by a 97-3 vote in the Senate. The law protected religious individuals and organizations from government interference with the practice of their faith. But the court, in the 1997 case City of Boerne vs. Flores held that the statute was unconstitutional because it exceeded federal power.

Volokh said the Boerne case is noteworthy in the health care debate because it was also a federalism case, meaning it was being challenged under the 10th Amendment that says powers not specifically granted to the federal government by the Constitution are reserved to the states.

Another interesting point: Ruth Bader Ginsberg and John Paul Stevens, two of the court’s liberal justices, joined the majority opinion.

""Were they stopped by the fact that this was a federal statute enacted by a nearly unanimous vote of the Congress? Absolutely not,"" Volokh said.

What’s more, he said, the Supreme Court is not supposed to consider a law’s popularity.

""It’s not its job to do that,"" Volokh said. ""You could imagine justices being influenced because justices are human. But according to the Constitution, a law is a law. … and a law that unconstitutional is unconstitutional.

""They’re not supposed to look at these things, and there’s considerable evidence that they often don’t.""

What else might Obama have meant when he said overturning the health care law would be unprecedented?

He was asked for just such clarification a day after the press conference at a luncheon with members of the Associated Press.

Obama’s response: ""We have not seen a court overturn a law that was passed by Congress on an economic issue, like health care ... at least since Lochner. Right? So we’re going back to the ’30s, pre-New Deal.""

He further explained that, because the court has extraordinary power as the final say on laws, it ""has traditionally exercised significant restraint and deference to our duly elected Legislature, our Congress. And so the burden is on those who would overturn a law like this.""

The president seemed to be framing the health care case in historical terms. He said that no law on an economic issue such as health care has been overturned in decades, and he cited Lochner vs. New York, a controversial 1905 decision striking down a New York labor law because it interfered with employer/employee contract rights. The case marked the beginning of what came to known as the Lochner era of the court, when justices overturned several laws through the 1930s on the grounds that they were an overreach by government into business. 
Obama further added that overturning such a far-reaching law as the health care bill would be atypical use of the court’s power.

So, when given the chance to explain, Obama wasn’t saying it would be unprecedented simply for the Supreme Court to overturn a federal law.

But ""this is not any law,"" said Norman Ornstein, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute.

""At least since the early part of the New Deal, when you had a Supreme Court that blocked at least a few initiatives of the new Roosevelt administration, we haven’t had a major social policy overturned,"" he said. ""And I don’t think any of them were as sweeping or significant in their effect on the country as this one (the health care law). They didn’t overturn Social Security; they didn’t overturn the (Works Progress Administration).""

He continued: ""If you’re looking at things that have had a big effect on people’s lives, you’d say Social Security and Medicare are the two biggest ones in the last 80 years. And I think you could make the case that while this (the health law) doesn’t affect everybody in the same way -- most people already have health insurance -- but everybody’s lives would be changed by this law because of the way that insurance would be provided and other changes in the law that affect how you deliver health care. And we’re talking about something that impinges on 17 percent of the economy, and that’s big stuff.""

Ornstein said that since the 1930s, there has been ""a wide acceptance of the role of government in the economy and affecting the social fabric of the country.""

""A decision that would not only affect the health care law but would also raise questions about other mandates... this could challenge the entire New Deal and post-New Deal structure of America. You’d have to say that’s unprecedented.""

Our ruling

That was a lot of Supreme Court history. First, let’s review Obama’s statement: ""Ultimately, I am confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress.""

There’s simply no support for the assertion that the law was passed by a ""strong majority."" It was passed along party lines in a sharply partisan climate, and the 60 votes in the Senate were the minimum needed to keep Republicans from bottling it up in a filibuster.

But the ""unprecedented"" idea is more nuanced. It’s without question that the Supreme Court overturning a law passed by Congress -- by any margin -- is a common and routine occurrence, and by no means without precedent. Volokh gave us a close analogy with the case of Boerne vs. Flores, a religious freedom law that glided through Congress but was held unconstitutional by a majority of the court, including two of its liberal justices.

However, Obama’s elaboration a day later at least gives us more to think about. He argued that invalidation of the health care law would represent a court action unseen since the Great Depression on an issue that affects every American. Ornstein echoed that interpretation, saying that a ruling by the court which overturns a major social policy and challenges prior court rulings would be unprecedented.

But we’re taking Obama literally, and that historical perspective was not reflected in his original statement, which is what we're ruling on. He simply said the law passed with a strong majority and overturning it would be unprecedented. Wrong and wrong. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2012/apr/04/barack-obama/obama-attaches-stark-terms-possible-supreme-court-/
"['History', 'Military', 'States', 'Texas', 'Chain email']","
Chain email says Texas reserved right to its own navy when it joined U.S.
","A Highway Patrol boat policing the Texas-Mexico border is part of the ""Texas Navy,"" claims a chain email sent to us February 19, 2012.

Alongside several pictures of a gun-carrying powerboat, the email says Texas is bringing new force to bear on drug cartel violence on the border. Falcon Lake will ""soon be safe"" as the Department of Public Safety launches ""our first Naval vessel of this century,"" it says.

It also claims, ""When Texas joined the Union as a sovereign nation in 1836, we retained the right to have a Navy to ward off the Mexicans.""

Did Texas keep, at statehood, the right to have its own navy?

First, about that gunboat: The craft pictured is part of the DPS’ Tactical Marine Unit, created in 2011. Laredo, McAllen and Brownsville region Commander Jose Rodriguez told us by telephone that it’s one of six shallow-water ""interceptor"" boats the state is buying for the marine unit -- which is not referred to as a ""navy,"" he said. DPS says the fleet will patrol the Rio Grande, border lakes and Intracoastal Waterway.

Second, let’s clear up a date error: Texas won its independence from Mexico in 1836 (the 176th anniversary of the decisive battle will be April 21, 2012) but didn’t join the United States until 1845.

In between, the Republic of Texas was an independent country, complete with a president, Congress and embassies in Paris, London and Washington.

The republic also had a navy -- two, in fact.

The Texas State Historical Association’s Handbook of Texas says that to guard supply lines from New Orleans, Texas’ provisional government passed an ""Act and Decree Establishing a Navy"" on November 25, 1835.

The first Texas Navy was four schooners purchased in January 1836 -- and all gone by mid-1837, according to the Handbook: 
That sounds dire, but Jeff Hunt, director of the Texas Military Forces Museum at Camp Mabry in Austin and an adjunct history professor at Austin Community College, told us the sailors acquitted themselves well in combat, considering their lack of resources.

In 1839, the Handbook says, Texas commissioned ships for a second navy. President Sam Houston thought the expense was extravagant and tried to sell the fleet in 1843.

""The people of Galveston, incensed at the thought of selling the navy, attended the auction and by force prevented the submission of bids. Thus the navy was returned to the Republic of Texas. Nevertheless, the cruise ending in July 1843 marked the end of the operative career of the Texas Navy, as a truce with Mexico came that summer and the United States undertook to protect Texas until her annexation.""

When Texas became part of the United States, its ships were ceded to the U.S. Navy via the Treaty of Annexation, Joint Resolution for Annexing Texas to the United States and Texas’ 1845 Constitution.

Historian T.R. Fehrenbach, author of ""Lone Star: A History of Texas and the Texans,"" told us by email, ""Texas did not retain the right to have its own navy under the annexation treaty."" None of the three documents mentioned a right to have a state navy.

Nor did seceding 16 years later change the terms, Fehrenbach said.

""One thing that is often overlooked is that according to a (U.S.) Supreme Court decision, Texas was never considered out of the Union, merely staging a rebellion that failed, so all of the provisions of the 1845 document (annexation treaty) were retained as valid,"" he said.

Then again, we noticed the state’s 1866 Constitution briefly mentions a state navy: ""The Governor shall be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of this State, and of the militia, except when they shall be called into the service of the United States.""

That constitution ""was obviated by the current one,"" Fehrenbach said. ""Nothing in it is applicable.""

Texas’ current constitution, adopted in 1876, and its statutes make no mention of a Texas Navy other than to declare the third Saturday in September ""Texian Navy Day,"" honoring the Republic’s two fleets.

Curiously, Texas governors have for decades granted purely honorary ""Texas Navy"" commissions. Governor’s office spokeswoman Steffany Duke told us by email, ""According to official records in both our office and the state archives, it appears that these ceremonial commissions date back to the late 1950s.""

The Texas Navy historical society says on its website that one of the first admirals was Hollywood dancer Ginger Rogers, commissioned by Gov. James V. Allred in 1936 (the year that the Dallasite starred as a sailor’s sweetheart in ""Follow the Fleet""). The society, although sometimes called the state’s ""Third Navy,"" is a purely historical group, created by Gov. Price Daniel in 1958.

Modern Texas’ naval military force is the 230-member Maritime Regiment, created in 2006 as part of the Texas State Guard. Brig. Gen. Robert Bodisch told us by telephone that his regiment is an emergency force trained in search and rescue, cadaver recovery and other crisis responses. While it is part of the Texas Military Forces, he said, it’s not a navy, which would comprise full-time professional troops.

Our ruling

We found no evidence that Texas retained the right to its own navy on joining the United States. The email’s central claim isn’t just incorrect, it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2012/apr/04/chain-email/chain-email-says-texas-reserved-right-its-own-navy/

Facebook post claims Urban Outfitters CEO backs Santorum
","
Somewhere between the pictures of cute Corgi puppies or tucked in with requests to play ""Hidden Chronicles"" and the 14th not-so-clever Happy Birthday wish for a friend, you might have seen a Facebook post about the CEO of Urban Outfitters -- a man named Richard Hayne.

""This is Richard Hayne, president and CEO of Urban Outfitters. He’s also a supporter of Rick Santorum and donated over $13,000 to him. He’s against gay marriage and abortion,"" says the post, with an attached photo.

""His company pulled a pro-gay shirt back in ‘08, they also blatantly ripped off an Etsy designers work, featured a T-shirt for women that said ‘eat less’ and most recently had a card with a ‘tranny’ slur on (it).

""He also owns Anthropologie and Free People.""

Hayne, 64, is indeed the chairman and CEO of Urban Outfitters Inc., a company that owns Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People -- popular stores with locations across the country. Hayne is worth $1.1 billion, according to Forbes.

Friends here in Florida who saw the Facebook post asked us to look into the connection between Hayne and Santorum, the former Republican U.S. senator who is running for president.

Hayne is from Philadelphia and attended Lehigh University near Allentown.

Santorum was elected to the U.S. House to represent a western Pennsylvania district in 1990, then was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1994, where he served two terms.

The campaign donations

Hayne has not contributed to Santorum’s presidential campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tabulates campaign contributions.

But Hayne and his wife Margaret have contributed to Santorum and his political action committee in the past.

From 1994-2005 the Haynes contributed $13,900 to Santorum or a PAC he started, Fight-PAC, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 
The donations ended when Santorum lost his Senate seat in 2006 to Democrat Bob Casey Jr. 
The Haynes, over time, also have contributed to former Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican political committee and more recently to Joseph Torsella, a Democrat who briefly ran for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, and Republican Rep. Patrick Meehan of Pennsylvania.

Hayne’s political stances

The record on Hayne’s personal and political beliefs is less clear. For his part, Hayne has tried to avoid the topic. (Santorum is a known opponent of abortion and gay marriage.)

In a profile in Philadelphia Weekly from 2003, Hayne was asked about his support for Santorum. He at first denied contributing to Santorum, according to the article.

Asked to clarify after being shown proof of his contributions, Hayne said: ""I don't want to mislead you. Like many people, I have some affinity for Rick Santorum, and I have problems with some of his positions.""

The author of the article, Jonathan Valania, then asked where does Santorum's position on homosexuality (Santorum opposes same-sex marriage and has suggested homosexual sex should be illegal) fit in Hayne’s comfort zone?

""I'm not going to comment on it,"" the magazine quoted Hayne as saying. ""I have my own opinion, but I am not going to share it. Our job as a business is not to promote a political agenda. That's not what we do. There are all kinds of political views held by my employees. Some would be horrified to learn that we contributed to Santorum's campaign, and others would be fine with it. We openly discuss and joke about our political differences.""

In a 2007 interview with Philadelphia Magazine, Hayne explained the contributions and support of Santorum this way: ""I don't like paying taxes -- is that a sin?"" he asks.

""I like small government,"" Hayne said, explaining a libertarian streak.

The company, for the record, has not commented on this latest kerfuffle or a similar uproar started in 2011 by a tweet from pop-star Miley Cyrus. Snopes.com failed to turn up anything additional on Hayne’s political positions, though they do a fine job in explaining the rest of the Facebook post if you’re looking to read more.

Our ruling

We’re focusing here on the Facebook claim that Urban Outfitters CEO Richard Hayne is a supporter of Rick Santorum and donated over $13,000 to him.

What we know is that Hayne was at one time a supporter of Santorum, who donated -- between him and his wife -- more than $13,000 to Santorum and one of his political action committees.

Hayne has not contributed to Santorum’s run for president, and we do not know if Hayne is supporting Santorum this time around. That, combined with the fact that the donations are nearly 7-18 years old, is enough for us to rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/apr/04/facebook-posts/facebook-post-claims-urban-outfitters-ceo-backs-sa/
"['New Jersey', 'Health Care', 'States', 'Donald Verrilli']","
Donald Verrilli says enrollment declined and rates increased when New Jersey adopted guaranteed coverage provisions in individual insurance market
","
A mandate for individuals to buy health insurance acts as a foundation for the national health care law, according to the federal government. Without it, the entire structure weakens.

During last week’s U.S. Supreme Court hearings on the law, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli cited New Jersey to support that argument.

Justice Antonin Scalia, in an exchange with Verrilli, said when people ""have a substantial risk of incurring high medical bills, they'll buy insurance, like the rest of us.""

Verrilli said: ""That's the problem, Justice Scalia. That's -- and that's exactly the experience that the states had that made the imposition of guaranteed issue and community rating not only be ineffectual but be highly counterproductive. Rates, for example, in New Jersey doubled or tripled, went from 180,000 people covered in this market down to 80,000 people covered in this market.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found the solicitor general is largely right.

Verrilli was referring to the individual market, a health insurance exchange that serves people who don’t have access to health insurance through their employer or through government programs such as Medicare.

In the early 1990s New Jersey implemented guaranteed issue -- a ban on insurers rejecting applicants -- and community rating -- a requirement prohibiting insurers from charging different rates regardless of risk -- in its individual market.

The federal law includes similar measures.

But unlike the federal government, New Jersey didn’t require residents to purchase health insurance. And, experts said, without a mechanism to push healthier people into buying coverage the state’s individual market nearly collapsed.

Data shows an initial spike then a steep decline in enrollment following the reforms. A 2004 article in the journal Health Affairs found the ""current situation points to a market that is heading for collapse. Enrollment has declined from a peak of 186,130 lives at the end of 1995 to 84,968 at the end of 2001. In addition, premiums have increased two- to threefold above their early levels.""

Enrollment in New Jersey’s market has rebounded since that report, but participation in a plan that allows for adjustment in rates based on age, gender and location is driving growth. The market’s standard plan also now allows for rate adjustment based on age.

Experts said New Jersey’s early experience with reforms was the most appropriate time frame for assessing Verrilli’s statement. By that account, his figures are roughly correct.

But is Verrilli right to claim the guaranteed coverage and cost provisions sparked enrollment decline and rate increases?

Health care experts acknowledged that other factors, such as a vibrant economy and loss of subsidies, may be involved, but said Verrilli’s overall point is strong.

""Without a coverage mandate the guaranteed issue and modified community rating provisions had the effect of encouraging sick people to purchase insurance and discouraging well people from purchasing insurance,"" which led to the rate increases, said John Jacobi, a professor of health law and policy at Seton Hall Law School

It’s worth noting that the average age and percentage of people who reported fair or poor health in the market increased for new enrollees from 1996 to 2002, according to a 2004 brief from Rutgers University’s Center for State Health Policy.

Alan Monheit, director of the Center for Health Economics and Health Policy at UMDNJ said, ""the statement is generally correct that without a mandate and with guaranteed issue and community rating that is certainly going to contribute to a potential unraveling of specific health plans within a marketplace and perhaps even the market itself.""

Our ruling

The solicitor general said after New Jersey adopted provisions guaranteeing health insurance coverage and controlling rates in the individual market without a mandate rates ""doubled or tripled"" and enrollment dropped from 180,000 people to 80,000 people.

Verrilli’s figures are roughly correct in the years before a modified plan was introduced that has since boosted total enrollment in the market.

GOP says Tim Kaine cut colleges by 25 percent
","
Editors note: This story was amended on July 19, 2012 to include the inflation-adjusted increases in tutition for in-state students Virginia's four-year colleges and community colleges during Tim Kaine's term as governor.  This does not affect our orignial ruling.  
Democratic Senate candidate Tim Kaine has been crisscrossing the state talking about the need to cultivate a talented workforce to boost the economy.

Republicans have pounced on the narrative, charging that Kaine undercut his goal when he was governor from January 2006 to January 2010.

The Republican Party of Virginia sent out a prepared statement by Del. Scott Lingamfelter, R-Prince William on Feb. 22, saying if Kaine was serious about developing a talent-based economy ""he wouldn’t have reduced higher education funding by 25 percent when he was governor, driving up tuition costs and making college less affordable for Virginia families and students.""

Did Kaine cut the higher education budget by 25 percent leading to higher tuition costs?

We asked Lingamfelter and officials at the state Republican Party  to back up the statement. In reading the explanations, keep in mind that Virginia’s fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30. The 2006 budget, for example, covered a fiscal year that ended June 30, 2006.

Lingamfelter cited data from a 2010 report by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia. It shows the amount of general funds spent for each in-state, full-time student at a four-year college fell from $8,709 in budget years 2006 and 2007 to $6,500 in 2010 and 2011. That’s a 25.4 percent drop.

At community colleges, average state funding per student fell from $4,602 in fiscal 2006 and 2007 to $2,946 in 2010 and 2011, a 36 percent decrease.

The SCHEV data focuses on general fund money the state gives colleges and universities to help pay for daily operations, such as faculty salaries and equipment. The general fund is mainly supported by taxes on income, corporations and sales. Higher education institutions cover their share of the costs through tuition. When state spending goes down, tuitions typically rise to deal with the shortfall, according to a 2009 SCHEV report.

Sure enough, tuition did go up during Kaine’s term. The average costs for in-state tuition and instructional fees at four-year institutions -- not including room and board -- rose from $3,812 in the 2005-2006 school year to $5,003 in 2009-2010. That’s a 31.2 percent increase. Adjusted for inflation, it's about a 19 percent rise.

The average cost for tuition and instructional fees at Virginia’s community colleges rose from $2,182 in the 2005-06 school year to $2,716 in 2009-10. That’s a 24.5 percent increase. Adjsuted for inflation, it's about a 13 percent rise.

Virginia’s experience was not unique; tuition and fees for in-state students at four-year public universities rose across the nation during Kaine’s term. The U.S. Department of Education said the national average increased by 23 percent during that span, the College Board says they rose by 29 percent.

Officials at the Republican Party of Virginia offered an additional justification to Lingamfelter’s claim that Kaine cut one-fourth of higher education funding. They compared outlays in Kaine’s mid-term 2008 budget to the farewell spending proposal he left behind for fiscal 2011 and 2012.

To check the GOP’s math, we turned to the Department of Planning and Budget for records of general fund dollars the state paid towards college operations, financial aid and research spending.

Kaine entered the governor’s mansion half way through fiscal 2006, inheriting a $1.45 billion budget for higher education costs. That rose to $1.76 billion in 2008. Kaine’s final budget proposal called for funding to hit a low point of $1.37 billion in fiscal 2012.

So if you compare the proposed 2012 valley to the 2008 peak, Kaine endorsed a 22.1 percent cut to higher education spending -- close to the Republicans’ number. But if you compare Kaine’s proposed 2012 funding to the level six years earlier when he came into office, the reduction is only 5.7 percent.

Is it fair to blame Kaine for the cuts to the colleges?

All of the spending levels Kaine recommended for colleges and universities -- within a few dollars -- were in state budgets that were approved with overwhelming bipartisan support in the Republican-controlled House of Delegates. Lingamfelter supported all the final budget bills.

Brandi Hoffine, a spokeswoman for the Kaine, said the former governor had to cut nearly every part of the state budget to cope with the deep recession.

She disputed that reductions to higher education hit 25 percent, saying the GOP cherry picked data. Hoffine said that Kaine backfilled most of his cuts in the 2010 and 2011 budgets with stimulus money from the federal government.  The stimulus ran out in 2012, however, leaving higher education in a hole.

Hoffine also noted that Kaine in 2008 pushed through a $1.4 billion bond program for building projects at colleges and universities.

Dan Hix, SCHEV’s finance policy director, said lumping together the general fund spending and the bond money is ""sort of an apples to oranges"" comparison. Colleges ""do need construction, but you can’t take that money and hire faculty, buy equipment,"" he said.

Our ruling

Lingamfelter said Kaine cut higher education by 25 percent, leading to higher tuition costs for in-state students. The delegate and the state GOP offered two sets of statistics to back the claim about the cuts.

Lingamfelter accurately referred to a SCHEV report showing per-student spending at four-year colleges dropped 25.4 percent from the 2006 to the 2011 state budget.  Republicans say bottom-line spending under Kaine decreased by 22.1 percent.  But to get to that number, they ignore increases to higher education made early in Kaine’s term and begin counting in 2008, when spending peaked, the recession set in and state politicians began to cut.

We think the purest measurement comes from comparing the 2006 budget Kaine essentially inherited to his farewell proposal that offered a spending plan through 2012. That shows Kaine endorsed budgets that reduced higher education spending by 5.7 percent over six years.

Lingamfelter’s statement puts full responsibility for the cuts on Kaine. But these were policy decisions that Lingamfelter and his fellow Republican delegates overwhelmingly supported by voting for state budgets.

So Lingamfelter is correct in saying that state spending on colleges went down under Kaine and in-state tuition went up.  But the most basic, bottom-line statistics do not produce the dramatic scale of spending cuts that the Republican claims. And his comment omits that Kaine did not unilaterally enact budgets; he needed the General Assembly’s help.

"['Water', 'Texas', 'Brigid Shea']","
Brigid Shea says Austin water rates doubled in decade and Austin water costs are greater than costs in the state's other biggest cities
","
Austin mayoral candidate Brigid Shea, suggesting city leaders have failed to bird-dog affordability, referred to water costs in a March 5, 2012, op-ed article in the Austin American-Statesman.

""One example is that in the past 10 years, our water rates have increased by 100 percent and we now have the highest water cost of the top 10 cities in Texas,"" Shea wrote. ""And this is before the water utility plans to raise costs by another 19 percent by 2016.""

The 19 percent figure is in keeping with the Austin Water Utility’s forecasts of future revenue needs, utility executive David Anders told us in a telephone interview. For this fact check, we’re gauging Shea’s claim that water rates doubled, which the utility concedes, and that water here costs more now than in other big Texas cities.

To our inquiry, Shea said by email that she drew upon a report posted online in February 2012 by an Austin environmental activist and consumer advocate, Paul Robbins, who edits the Austin Environmental Directory.

Robbins’ report, funded in part by the Save Our Springs Alliance, used his methodology to compare water and wastewater costs in Austin to costs in other big Texas cities as well as nearby towns and cities, though we’re not exploring those comparisons because Shea did not speak to that.

Between 2000 and 2012, Robbins’ report says, Austin’s water rates went up 100 percent and its wastewater rates increased 97 percent. Over those years, the report says, inflation was 35 percent.

Asked to respond, Jason Hill, a spokesman for the Austin Water Utility, did not quibble with that calculation of rate increases, saying by email that combined water and wastewater rates doubled from 2002 to 2012.

But the utility looks at water costs differently, we learned.

Robbins calculated that for water customers of all kinds -- residential, multifamily (as in apartments), commercial and industrial -- Austin’s 2011 cost of water was $4.87 per thousand gallons. Corpus Christi’s 2011 cost for the same amount of water, ranking second, was $4.12, the report says, with San Antonio’s cost, $4.11, ranking third among the state’s biggest cities.

Austin did not come out No. 1 in all the water-cost breakdowns. Corpus Christi’s 2011 costs of water for multifamily and commercial customers exceeded Austin’s costs.

Generally, the report says, Austin’s costs are higher for various reasons, including that debt service comprises 41 percent of the Austin utility’s combined 2012 water/wastewater bills. The report notes too that the population in the Austin utility’s service area increased 20 percent between 2000 and 2010 while, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the other nine large cities averaged 12 percent population growth.

Also, the report says, annual transfers from the Austin utility’s proceeds to the city for other purposes are expected to total $36.5 million over the 12 months that began in October 2011. In 2000, the report says, such transfers totaled $17.2 million, which adjusted for inflation would be $28.5 million in 2012.

Hill, the utility’s spokesman, said in a telephone interview that the utility had not calculated water costs in Robbins’ fashion. ""We’re not in a tit for tat,"" Hill said. ""He has an opinion on something, on how he’s done the mathematics. Our priority is not, ‘Oh, he’s completely wrong.’ We have our way of doing the rates.""

Utility official Daryl Slusher later said by email that the utility questions the ""meaningfulness"" of Robbins’ methodology which, Slusher noted, does not tease out how little a conserving Austin resident pays for water nor how much heavy residential users pay under the utility’s tiered rate structure. Robbins later acknowledged that, pointing out, though, that only Austin’s residential rates are tiered to encourage conservation, though other customers are charged slightly more during the hottest summer months.

Slusher also pointed out that the utility’s annual surveys of rates in other cities indicate that  based on average residential water consumption, Austin’s rates are not always highest.

In 2011, the utility’s analysis says, the average Austin monthly residential water bill of $27.79 was greater than comparable bills in San Antonio, Arlington, Dallas, El Paso and Amarillo, though less than such bills in Fort Worth, Houston, Corpus Christi, Cedar Park, San Marcos, Pflugerville and Lubbock. In 2012, the utility says, the estimated average monthly residential water bill of $33.22 is expected to be less than comparable bills in Georgetown, Cedar Park, Corpus Christi, San Marcos, Pflugerville and Lubbock.

Slusher said the 2012 projected average bill includes the new revenue stability fee, which took effect in November 2011. The utility says the  fee -- $4.40 for a ⅝-inch water meter, with larger meters having a higher fee -- will generate $17 million in 2012 to be collected regardless of how much water is sold during the year.

""On the other hand,"" Slusher said, ""we acknowledge that Austin Water’s combined (water and wastewater) rates are among the highest in the state. Austin Water, however, delivers a lot of value for that cost."" He listed among examples past actions to secure the water supply through 2100, manage land for water quality and endangered species protection, add a water treatment plant, expand the wastewater system’s reclaimed water system and encourage ""green"" energy choices. By email, Robbins said none of those items are unique to the Austin utility.

Also, Slusher said, successes Austin has enjoyed conserving water, detailed in a November 2011 fact check, help explain the utility’s higher costs per thousands of gallons shown by Robbins’ methodology. ""If our conservation programs had not achieved as much as they have then Austin Water’s cost per gallon in Mr. Robbins’ report would be much lower. So if the metric by which we measure ourselves were the one he uses in his report then there would be a disincentive to conserve,"" Slusher said.

Our ruling

Austin’s water/wastewater rates increased about 100 percent from 2000 to 2012, not taking inflation into account.

And does water cost more in Austin than in the other biggest Texas cities? For residential customers, that depends on how much is used. Overall, if Austin doesn’t always have the highest water costs among the biggest Texas cities, it’s in the running.

"['Georgia', 'Children', 'Labor', 'Rashad Taylor']","
Federal stats back up agriculture deaths claim
","
Most nonbinding resolutions that come before the Georgia House of Representatives garner little debate, but one involving child labor laws got a little testy.

Some House members were angry about a U.S. Department of Labor proposal they say would make it tougher for children to work on the family farm. Agriculture is Georgia’s largest industry. So Georgia lawmakers wrote House Resolution 1561, which said the federal agency ""seeks to impose harsh, extreme, and uncalled for regulations attempting to ban students from working on farms.""

Not so, said Rep. Rashad Taylor, an Atlanta Democrat who opposed the resolution. Taylor said he’s worried about the safety of children working on some farms. He offered several amendments to the resolution, claiming portions of it were incorrect. Taylor’s argument included a claim that some lawmakers quickly disputed.

""More children die in agricultural jobs than in any other industry,"" he said.

One lawmaker suggested more children die playing football than from agricultural work. Another suggested the numbers may be higher because more children work in agriculture than other industries.

Rep. Penny Houston, a Republican from South Georgia, asked Taylor several pointed questions that suggested she didn’t think the lawmaker from the big city understood the issue. Her questions included a query wondering if Taylor had ever picked peas.

We dug deep on Taylor’s claim.

Currently, minors may be employed by their parents at any time in any occupation on a farm owned or operated by his or her parents.

Unfortunately, there’s not much research on child labor deaths. The most recent data came to us from a department within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They put together a spreadsheet using Bureau of Labor Statistics data to determine the number of children 18 and under who died on the job between 2003 and 2010. During that time, there were 311 deaths nationwide. Nearly half of those deaths, 151, were in the agriculture industry, the data showed.

A CDC spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia that 73 percent of all work-related deaths for children 15 and under were in the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries. They did not have a more specific breakdown for all industries.

A 2006 study by two CDC researchers reached similar conclusions. The study was based on two sets of data from 1992 to 2002. In that report, they noted research that found an astounding 79 percent of all work-related deaths for youths 10 years of age and younger occurred in agriculture production.

""As a proportion of all young workers, young workers in agriculture production incur a disproportionate share of fatalities,"" the 2006 report says.

The National Consumers League puts out an annual list of the most dangerous occupations for teenagers. In 2011, the most dangerous industry for young people 18 and younger was agriculture, with a death rate of 21.3 per 100,000 full-time employees, according to the report.

Another report we saw, using BLS data, showed between 1992 and 1998 that nearly 43 percent of work-related fatalities for children 18 and younger were due to agricultural work. The second-highest percentage of fatalities was in retail trade.

So why are a high proportion of children losing their lives in agriculture industries?

One report found the most common cause of death of youths in agriculture is from farm
machinery, such as a harvester or tractor. Between 1992 and 1997, 51 deaths of youths in agriculture nationwide could be specifically attributed to overturned tractors.

Other research shows a high number of falls from moving vehicles or mobile equipment and being struck by the same.

There are few reports on this subject, and there are very few deaths to study.

But everything we’ve seen shows a high percentage of work-related deaths among children occur in agriculture. The most recent data shows it is nearly 50 percent. The numbers seem to back up Taylor’s claim.

For the record, Taylor’s efforts to amend the resolution failed. The resolution passed.

Maybe PolitiFact’s ruling will give Taylor some solace. Maybe not.

We rate his claim True.

Rick Santorum says seven or eight Calif. universities 'don't even teach' American history
","
Rick Santorum might want to read more closely next time.

On the stump in Wisconsin on April 2, 2012, the Republican presidential candidate filled in his audience on something he was ""just reading … last night.""

""I think it’s seven or eight of the California system of universities don’t even teach an American history course. It’s not even available to be taught,"" he said. ""Just to tell you how bad it's gotten in this country, where we're trying to disconnect the American people from the roots of who we are, so they have an understanding of what America should be.""

Soon the progressive news site Think Progress posted a video clip, along with some skepticism, triggering links around the Web.

Readers asked us: Was Santorum right? Do that many state universities in California fail to offer American history courses?

‘The California system of universities’

California has a two-tiered university system, with 23 campuses in the California State University system and 10 University of California campuses.

All 23 CSU campuses offer courses on U.S. History, the Constitution and American ideals, said Erik Fallis, media relations manager for the California State University — indeed, almost every student needs such a class (or two) to graduate.

The story is slightly different at the University of California, which also has an American history and institutions requirement. The graduation requirement can be satisfied with a high school class, except at UC Santa Barbara, which requires a college-level course.

Does that mean the campuses don’t offer American history courses? Not at all.

Of the nine University of California campuses that offer humanities classes — the San Francisco campus focuses exclusively on health sciences — all nine offer American history.

Do those classes get to ""the roots of who we are,"" as Santorum said?

Well, among the offerings at UC Davis is ""The American Revolution, 1763-1790."" UC Riverside teaches upper-division courses on ""Revolutionary America"" and ""The Early Republic: The United States, 1789-1848."" UC Santa Cruz includes a course on the ""U.S. Revolution: 1740-1815."" UC Berkeley addresses, ""The United States from Settlement to Civil War."" UCLA has ""History of the U.S. and Its Colonial Origins: 19th Century"" and ""Constitutional History of U.S.: Origins and Development of Constitutionalism in U.S.""

Bottom line, of 33 state universities in California, just one, a health sciences campus, doesn’t teach American history — and nearly all graduates have to complete a related course to graduate, whether in high school or college.

What was Santorum talking about?

Santorum’s reading

We contacted Santorum’s campaign to ask for support for his claim but didn’t hear back.

So we tried tracing his reading material ourselves.

Eric Dolan, an editor for progressive news site Raw Story, noted that Santorum appeared to be making a reference to a recent opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, ""How California's Colleges Indoctrinate Students.""

The March 30, 2012, column by Hoover Institution fellow Peter Berkowitz argues that higher education is politicized and declining in quality as its curriculum changes.

He notes: ""None of the nine general campuses in the UC system requires students to study the history and institutions of the United States. None requires students to study Western civilization, and on seven of the nine UC campuses, including Berkeley, a survey course in Western civilization is not even offered.""

Berkowitz is right that most University of California campuses don’t require a college-level course, with the exception of Santa Barbara — though they do require at least a high-school level class.

We didn’t check on class offerings in Western civilization, since that’s not what Santorum said.

Berkowitz also cites a recent report, called ""A Crisis of Competence,"" from the National Association of Scholars, where he’s on the board of directors. It mentions that ""the vast majority of our colleges have made a course on the broad themes of U.S. history or government optional.""

Then it points out a laudable exception: The California State University system.

""All but three of the more than twenty campuses of the CSU system require American History and Institutions as an essential part of their curricula. But the situation in UC is very different: not a single UC campus has such a requirement. … To be sure, UC requires a year of U.S. history in high school for undergraduate admissions, but University of California level instruction ought to be on a completely different level – why otherwise would students need to go on to a university at all if high school coursework is equivalent?""

Santorum went much further than either Berkowitz or the National Association of Scholars report, declaring that at seven or eight universities in the California system, they ""don’t even teach an American history course.""

There’s simply no support for that claim.

Our ruling

Rick Santorum said, ""I think it’s seven or eight of the California system of universities don’t even teach an American history course. It’s not even available to be taught."" While he appeared to be referencing a recent Wall Street Journal opinion piece, he bungled the details — and badly. Far from ""not available,"" American history courses are offered at all but one of 33 state universities in California.

"['Florida', 'Guns', 'Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence']","
Can you get a gun in Florida without ever leaving your home?
","
Obtaining a permit to carry a concealed gun in Florida is so easy that Floridians can do it without leaving the comfort of their own homes, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

Dan Gross, the president of the group, testified about Florida’s gun laws at a briefing held with some congressional Democrats March 27. The topic was racial profiling and ""stand your ground"" laws in the wake of the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin. 
Martin, an unarmed black teenager from Miami Gardens, was shot and killed by a white neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla. The volunteer, George Zimmerman, has not been arrested, and that has spurred debate of Florida’s ""stand your ground"" gun law.

The Brady Campaign says Florida has become a ""great success story"" for the gun lobby.

""In Florida, being armed in public is such a casual formality that law enforcement does not issue the license to carry loaded, concealed guns; that is done by the Department of Agriculture – the same agency charged with issuing permits to pick tomatoes or transport livestock,"" Gross said.  
""Their website is FreshFromFlorida.com. You can use it to get a permit to carry a loaded hidden gun without ever leaving your house,"" he added.

Gross made it sound incredibly easy to obtain a concealed weapons permit. Can Floridians simply log on to FreshFromFlorida.com and obtain a weapons permit without getting off the couch? We decided to investigate.

Requirements for a concealed weapons permit in Florida

The Brady Campaign is right that it is the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services that issues concealed weapons permits. It was easy to download the two-page application and about 45 pages containing the application instructions and the law.

But the process is much more complicated than just filling out an online form.

Candidates must provide a photograph, pay a fee and have their application form notarized. Most significantly for purposes of this fact-check, applicants must show proof of having gone through a firearms training class, and they must be fingerprinted. (Out-of-state applicants don’t have to come to Florida but must follow the same guidelines, including getting fingerprinted by law enforcement.) We thought those two requirements showed the Brady Campaign was wrong in its statement.

The Brady Campaign, though, responded to our questions and argued that even these two criteria could be done from home. So let’s review the evidence.

• Firearms training documentation: Florida law states in 790.06(2)(h) that an instructor ""must maintain records certifying that he or she observed the student safely handle and discharge the firearm."" That can be a class taught by law enforcement, the National Rifle Association, or any other class approved by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

So that rules out an online course, said Sterling Ivey, spokeman for the agriculture department.

But the Brady Campaign responded that some certified instructors will come to your home, pointing us to groups like Florida Concealed Weapons Carry. Its website states: ""We will come to your location and provide a shooting trailer anywhere within an hour and a half radius from Starke, Fla. We provide all materials, concealed weapons pictures, and notary on the spot.""

We spoke to the owner of that company, Eric Wall.

""When I go to their house we usually have it in their living room or whatever to go over the details of concealed carry,"" he said. Then the applicants head to his trailer, which is a mobile shooting range. ""I have to physically watch everyone handle, load and shoot a firearm.""

Worried the neighbors might complain about your participation in a mobile firearm class in your driveway?

The trailer is soundproof, said Wall. He’s even done training at dentists’ and doctors' offices, he said. (We should note that going into the trailer means you need to leave your house, even though you're still on your own property.)

Wall said he can take care of the firearms class, photo and notary all at an applicant's home. Typically, Wall trains small groups and charges $50 per person, but it depends on the distance he has to travel. 

We also spoke to Irving Gelbart, a retired Miami-Dade police lieutenant who teaches mobile classes through his company, Pentagon Defense Products and Training Alliance. Gelbart said he will do the class work in someone’s home but prefers a range for the shooting portion.

The Brady Campaign also noted that applicants can use past shooting experience, pointing to language on the application that says acceptable documentation includes ""evidence of experience with a firearm obtained through participation in organized shooting competition.""

Ivey said a mobile firearm class is allowed, as long as it meets the requirements of having the instructor observe the student safely handle the firearm. He also said that past shooting experience is acceptable, but that would likely have meant the person left their home.

• A set of fingerprints or a copy of a receipt showing that they had a scan of their fingerprints: Florida’s application states that ""fingerprints must be taken at a LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY’’ and the statute requires ""a full set of fingerprints of the applicant administered by a law enforcement agency.

We thought this element definitely contradicted the Brady Campaign’s statement, but spokeswoman Caroline Brewer said not so fast.

""Our statement was discussing the application form that is downloadable from the Florida website, which the context makes clear,"" she said via email. ""However, even if you read our statement as applying to the separate fingerprint card sent by mail and not downloadable, yes, there are many fingerprinting services that say they will come to your home to take your fingerprints, some of which even say that they are done under the authority of law enforcement and valid for Florida.""

The Brady Campaign pointed us to several mobile fingerprinting services. These services do exist, but we could not find a mobile company that would provide this service at Floridians’ homes. We spoke to owners at three mobile fingerprint companies in Florida -- 1 SureScan in Orlando, Anytime Mobile Fingerprinting in the Tampa area and Fingerprint Technologies in Coral Gables -- who told us that they had inquired with FDLE about providing that service and had been discouraged or told it wasn’t allowed. 

We asked FDLE if they would accept fingerprints from a mobile company for the concealed weapons permit. FDLE spokesman Keith Kameg replied: ""It is our understanding that FL Statute 790.06 (4)(c) states that fingerprinting is to be administered by a law enforcement agency.  FDLE performs the background checks and provides the results to Department of Agriculture.""

Possible -- but common?

Clearly, many applicants handle at least part of the application process from home: Since July 2011, about 45,000 used the agriculture department’s regional offices while 89,000 mailed them in from elsewhere.

And it is possible to download the permit from FreshFromFlorida.com, hire a mobile firearm instructor/notary/photographer, and mail in the application from home. There is no way to know how many applicants -- if any  -- have done that. Several experts on Florida’s permitting process said either that they had never heard of mobile firearms training or that it was a rarity.

The part of the Brady Campaign's claim that seems to fall short is about fingerprints: We could not find any indication that applicants in Florida could summon mobile fingerprinters to their homes.

Our ruling

Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said that at the Florida Department of Agriculture’s website FreshFromFlorida.com, people can ""get a permit to carry a loaded hidden gun without ever leaving your house.""

The Brady Campaign argued that their claim referred to the application itself. But fingerprints are required as part of the application process, and Gross made no such distinction in his statement.

We think his overall message was clear: He was trying to convey that it’s so easy to get a gun permit that you can do it from home.

The law, though, requires that people receive firearms training and be fingerprinted by law enforcement, two elements that would typically require people to leave their homes. While it’s possible to pay a firearms trainer to come to your property, we found no evidence that such training is widespread. We also found no evidence that mobile fingerprinting would be allowed for the gun permit application in the state of Florida.

Do streetcars really beat out buses in capacity, ridership and cost?
","
Portland mayoral candidate Charlie Hales is well known for his support of streetcar projects. He promoted them in Portland during his time as a city council member, then ended his term early to go help other cities start their own.

Hales hasn’t advocated expanding the city’s system during his current campaign, but the subject keeps coming up. During an appearance on Oregon Public Broadcasting’s ""Think Out Loud,"" Hales explained why he’s so keen on street cars.

It comes down to three things, he said: Because ""streetcars carry more people than buses. Because you attract more riders who don't ride transit now. And actually the operating costs are not any greater than the bus. The trick is coming up with the very large capital cost.""

These sorts of talking points get thrown around a lot by rail-system advocates. We thought it was high time we checked it out.

Our first call was to Hales’ campaign. His spokeswoman, Jessica Moskovitz, sent us a thorough e-mail outlining the support for the various pieces of the statement. Before we get to all that, though, let’s start with TriMet when spokeswoman Mary Fetsch.

On whether streetcars carry more people than buses, there is no ambiguity. Streetcars have a maximum capacity of 92 riders, according to Fetsch. That’s nearly double the 51 or so riders who can fit on a single bus. (It was clear during the interview that Hales was talking capacity here and not the actual number of riders.)

The next part was about whether streetcars have a smaller operating cost. Naturally, our minds went to the huge down payment a city has to make on tracks, whereas a bus can use existing roads. But Hales was careful to take that out of the equation by acknowledging the startup costs. It’s clear he was talking about day-to-day operation. On that point, he seems to be right again.

According to Fetsch, the streetcar operations cost $1.50 per boarding ride, while the bus costs $2.82. Now, there are a few important caveats here. Portland’s streetcar system is much smaller than TriMet's bus and MAX systems. That’s important because those two systems require a command center, which deals with dispatch and customer service. The streetcar also ducks security charges -- Portland police take care of the streetcar while TriMet has to budget for the Transit Police Division.

You also have to consider the fact that the streetcar serves just the city core, while the MAX and bus systems operate in the low-density, outer areas and run both earlier and later.

The last bit of important context here, too, is that the streetcar system requires fewer maintenance expenses: It’s younger and it runs at lower speeds, so it has less wear than the MAX and bus system.

That leaves us with the last bit: Do streetcars really attract riders who don’t typically take public transit?

Moskovitz, the spokeswoman for Hales, pointed us to a study by Edson Tennyson for the National Research Council on the issue of rail transit. Tennyson concluded that, all things being equal, ""rail transit is likely to attract 34 percent to 43 percent more riders than will equivalent bus services.""

There was a catch, though: That paper was written more than two decades ago. The only other source Moskovitz had was an article touting the increase in streetcar ridership.

TriMet, however, had two pieces of pertinent information.

First up, between 2000 and 2003, bus stops within a sixth of a mile of the streetcar saw ridership drop by 20 percent when the rail went online. Meanwhile, the streetcar ridership grew well beyond that drop, indicating the system was attracting more people than just those who would have ridden the bus. Second, according to a June 2011 rider study, 38 percent of occasional and infrequent riders exclusively used the MAX, while only 12 percent exclusively used the bus. Of course, the MAX is not the streetcar, but this fact seems to speak to the attractiveness of rail travel over bus for some transit users.

While the data are somewhat old and somewhat tangential, taken together they seem to support Hale’s claim that the streetcar attracts more infrequent riders.

So that brings us to the ruling. Hales said ""streetcars carry more people than buses … you attract more riders who don't ride transit now, and actually the operating costs are not any greater than the bus."" Whether these arguments make a persuasive case for the necessity and usefulness of a streetcar system is, of course, up for debate. The statement itself remains factual. While, there’s some missing context, it’s nothing significant. We rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2012/apr/03/charlie-hales/do-streetcars-really-beat-out-buses-capacity-rider/

Ohio Democratic Party says Josh Mandel accused banks of fraud but waited a year to take action
","
Ohio Democrats have turned state Treasurer Josh Mandel into their favorite punching bag.

They question the GOP Senate candidate’s ambition, his work ethic and his truthfulness. Now the Ohio Democratic Party and Sen. Sherrod Brown’s campaign are questioning Mandel’s integrity.

Mandel announced last month that his office was cutting ties with two banks he suspects of fraud. His opponents pounced. Justin Barasky, a spokesman for Brown and former state party press secretary, emailed that Mandel had raised questions about fraud while campaigning for the treasurer’s post nearly two years ago. ""Why,"" Barasky wondered, ""did Mandel not lead the way by acting against the banks as soon as he took office?""

An email from the state party had similar language but was much more direct. The missive was loaded with pointed accusations that Mandel allowed ""alleged fraud"" to occur and suggestions that he acted only when it became politically convenient to do so.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to home in on the overarching theme of the party’s news release, which was conveyed in the document’s subtitle: ""Mandel first claimed bank fraud in June 2010 but did nothing for more than a year while raising money for his Senate campaign.""

Of interest are the two core contentions -- that Mandel claimed bank fraud in June 2010 and did nothing until now. But before we go any further, let’s dispense with some helpful background.

The two banks in question are Bank of New York Mellon and State Street Corp. Combined, they hold more than $41 billion in international assets owned by four of Ohio’s five pension funds.

Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine sued BNY Mellon in March 2012, accusing the bank of overcharging two pension funds on foreign currency transactions. DeWine was still reviewing the foreign currency practices of State Street, his spokeswoman said at the time.

Mandel announced his decision to dump both banks on March 19, days after DeWine filed the suit. In a news release, the treasurer’s office noted that BNY Mellon and State Street ""have been accused of defrauding pension funds in Ohio and numerous other states.""

PolitiFact Ohio is not about to referee these court disputes. Instead, we set out to determine whether the Ohio Democratic Party was correct in its criticism of Mandel’s actions.

The party’s March 20 news release offered three supporting statements in bullet-point fashion and under the heading ""Here’s what we know."" The three points, as they appeared:
  
The state party has cited three news articles as key sources for these claims: a June 2010 Columbus Dispatch story, a September 2010 Cincinnati Enquirer story and a Crain’s Cleveland Business report from 2011.

Let’s dig into the party’s timeline.

The ""21 months ago"" claim is based on the Dispatch article. Mandel at the time was running against Boyce, the Democratic incumbent. Other Ohio newspapers first reported issues about State Street around that time.

Although the Democrats cite The Dispatch piece as the first utterance of fraud, the story led with Mandel attacking Boyce for ""cronyism and corruption."" His main beef was that Boyce, his opponent, had awarded work to State Street, which had hired his top deputy’s friend as a lobbyist.

A paragraph in The Dispatch story noted that State Street was ""under investigation in California for possible fraud involving $56 million in state pension funds there."" But nowhere in the article did Mandel directly address that State Street probe. And he did not mention BNY Mellon at all.

It would be wrong to say that the State Street accusations were not on his radar screen. Ten days before The Dispatch ran its story, Plain Dealer reporter Joe Guillen wrote a detailed piece on Boyce’s decision to award the contract to State Street despite the issues in California. Mandel is not quoted, but three days later he referenced the story in a letter demanding answers from State Street officials.

The letter, a copy of which was provided to Guillen, alluded to the California lawsuit but mainly inquired about State Street’s hiring of Noure Alo, the lobbyist tied to Boyce’s deputy.

For his part, Boyce always has maintained he did nothing improper.

Between news coverage and the letter, three things are apparent. One, Mandel was mainly concerned about contract-steering, an explicit accusation his spokesman made to the Dayton Daily News on May 23, 2010. Two, the fraud accusation did not originate with Mandel; it originated in California. Three, Mandel never raised concerns about BNY Mellon.

PolitiFact Ohio scoured a LexisNexis database of news articles and found the first mention of Mandel and BNY Mellon in an Associated Press story that ran a few days before the Crain’s report, six months after Mandel took office.

It also is important to note that Mandel did not accuse State Street of fraud in Ohio.

If you’re keeping score at home, so far the Ohio Democratic Party’s timeline is correct on one count. Mandel did ask DeWine to investigate both banks nine months ago, in June 2011.

Yet it is that fact that contradicts the remaining half of the state party’s claim -- that Mandel did not ""actually take action"" until last month. The sentiment here is that Mandel allowed fraud to occur for more than a year after taking office.

There is no dispute that Mandel asked for an investigation six months into his term. PolitiFact Ohio asked Mandel’s staff for more background on the process and learned an internal review began even sooner. The findings turned up enough abnormalities involving both BNY Mellon and State Street to warrant DeWine’s outside investigation, officials said.

Mandel spokesman Seth Unger told PolitiFact Ohio that pension fund managers were alerted to the treasurer’s suspicions and reminded to be vigilant on matters of foreign currency exchanges. Dumping BNY Mellon and State Street on Day One would have been impossible, Unger said. Mandel wanted to be certain there were grounds for replacing them before pulling the trigger.

 ""We really did our due diligence,"" Unger said.

The Ohio Democratic Party’s claim -- ""Mandel first claimed bank fraud in June 2010 but did nothing for more than a year while raising money for his Senate campaign"" -- collapses under scrutiny.

It is incorrect and misleading to say Mandel ""claimed bank fraud"" against BNY Mellon and State Street when he focused his public statements solely on State Street and clearly attributed them to the investigation in California. It also is misleading to strip those statements of the full context: that Mandel was mainly concerned about contract-steering and cronyism.

Furthermore, it is ridiculous for the Ohio Democratic Party to charge Mandel with more than a year of neglect when it acknowledges the DeWine investigation began last June.

That leaves the party without a sturdy leg of truthfulness to stand on. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2012/apr/03/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-says-josh-mandel-accused-ban/

Travis DA Rosemary Lehmberg says she created state's first deferred prosecution program for nonviolent first offenders
","
In an online video, Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who seeks re-election  this year, says she has instituted reforms since she took office in 2009. 
""My office is the most progressive DA’s office in the state,"" she says. ""I’ve created the first felony deferred prosecution program for nonviolent first-offenders, and it gives them a chance to stay out of the system with a clean record."" 
Vince Leibowitz, a campaign consultant for Charlie Baird, who is challenging Lehmberg in the May Democratic primary, questioned Lehmberg’s statement that her program was the first of its kind in the state and asked us to fact-check it. 
The Travis County program, which Lehmberg announced in May 2010, gives people who have committed certain felony offenses an opportunity to avoid being prosecuted for a crime by agreeing to meet certain conditions for a period of time. 
A March 23, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article on the program points out that since the 1990s, people with drug addictions and no previous convictions for violent offenses could escape certain felony charges by completing the county’s drug court program, which requires a year of intensive treatment, drug testing and court appearances aimed at ending addictions. 
Lehmberg told us in a telephone interview that she started the felony deferred prosecution program to provide the same second-chance opportunity for nonviolent, first-time felony offenders who are not addicts. ""Sort of a parallel track,"" she said. The program is for people with no prior record who made a mistake and want to make it right, she said. If they complete the program, the charges are dismissed. 
Applicants must be facing third-degree or state jail felony charges such as theft, forgery, credit card abuse, tampering with a governmental record, and evading arrest, according to the program’s web page. 
Through their attorneys, clients apply using a form posted online that asks for basic information, including the defendant’s school and work history, an account of the crime and information about previous contact with the criminal justice system. The application is screened by lawyers in Lehmberg’s office, who typically make the decision on whether to accept an applicant. 
Offenders accepted into the program sign a form pleading guilty and enter into a written agreement with the office laying out the terms they must meet for a set time, up to two years, including not being re-arrested. Other possible conditions of participation are community service, counseling and paying restitution. While people are in the program, their cases are tracked by state District Judge Mike Lynch. 
The deferred prosecution program, also called a pretrial diversion program, started in September 2010. The Statesman article said that through March 12, 2012, 131 people had been accepted, with 26 having completed the program and eight having been discharged without finishing. 
So, is the program the first of its kind in the state? 
During our research, several prosecutors and experts told us that generally, prosecutors don’t have to develop a formal program like Lehmberg’s to practice ""deferred prosecution."" That’s because local prosecutors have long been free to decide not to proceed with a case. A common example: Dismissing the charges against a young adult in exchange for his or her joining the military. 
Such case-by-case arrangements are a form of deferred prosecution, Williamson County District Attorney John Bradley told us in a telephone interview. But typically, when someone is talking about a deferred prosecution program, he said, there are more formalized elements that have been put in place such as a list of qualifications and a screening process. 
Bradley, who has been a prosecutor since 1989, said he didn’t know whether Travis County was the first in the state to offer such a program for certain felony offenders. Most Texas deferred prosecution programs focus on misdemeanors, he said. ""It is unusual and rare at the felony level to have a deferred prosecution program,"" he said. 
Unlike counties such as Dallas and Bexar where the district attorney prosecutes both felonies and misdemeanors, Travis has a separate elected official, the county attorney, whose office handles misdemeanor cases. And that office had a diversion program long before Lehmberg launched her version, according to Lehmberg and the Statesman article. 
Lehmberg told us that it’s ""pretty common"" for prosecutors at both the felony and misdemeanor level to offer deferred prosecutions on a case-by-case basis. Narrowing the claim she aired in the video, Lehmberg said she is not aware of any other formalized non-drug-court deferred prosecution program for felony offenders that has an ""application and acceptance process"" like Travis County’s. 
She told us that before making her campaign video, she checked with some other Texas prosecutors and Robert Kepple, executive director of the Texas District and County Attorneys Association, to determine whether another program like hers had been started. She found none. 
Kepple told us that the association did not know of any other program like Travis’ but that he had not researched the question specifically. 
Yet, we later learned of two programs that while not identical to the one in Travis County, appear to have similar goals and share some of its processes. One, in the East Texas county of Nacogdoches, started the same year as Travis County’s, in 2010. The other, in the South Texas county of Cameron, began about five years earlier. 
We were alerted to the Nacogdoches program by an email sent from Austin lawyer Oscar Buitron in response to the Statesman article. 
Like Travis County, Nacogdoches has a district attorney who handles felony cases and a county attorney in charge of misdemeanor cases. We were unable to reach District Attorney Nicole LoStracco but found a May 1, 2010, news article reporting that she was starting a pretrial diversion program. We also talked with Nacogdoches defense attorney John Heath Jr. who said he has had many clients in LoStracco’s program. 
The 2010 article, in the Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel, quoted LoStracco as saying that under the program, first-time felony offenders who meet certain qualifications could avoid a permanent red flag on their record. She said her program would be for people who realize that they made a mistake, are repentant, and are willing to learn from the mistake and move on. 
The article said LoStracco’s office had put in place ""guidelines"" for the program, including that first-time felony offenders who aren’t likely to commit another offense will be considered. The article also said that defense lawyers must approach the district attorney’s office to apply for the program and that candidates would be required to fill out an application. Participants would also have to write a confession and pay any owed restitution up front, according to the article. 
Ultimately, LoStracco told the Daily Sentinel, she will decide who qualifies for the program and is ""the only one in the DA’s office that can authorize someone to be put on the program."" The article said those in the Nacogdoches pretrial diversion program would be monitored by the local probation department. Conditions of the program could include community service, alcohol or drug testing, or counseling, the article said. 
On June 1, 2011, the Daily Sentinel wrote a news article reporting that in the year since the program’s start, 37 felony offenders had been placed into the program, with only two having been removed for failing to meet the conditions. 
Heath Jr., the defense attorney, told us that upon completion of the program, participants have the charges against them dismissed. 
We learned about the Cameron County program from a 2005 news article on the Brownsville Herald’s website that was sent to us by Tobin Lefler, director of Cameron County’s adult probation department. 
Armando Villalobos, the county’s top prosecutor, handles both felonies and misdemeanors. That means the county’s pretrial diversion program, which Villalobos began in 2005, is open to both misdemeanor and felony offenders. 
The Dec. 27, 2005, article says that Villalobos, of late a U.S. House candidate, launched the program to give eligible defendants a chance to avoid criminal records that could ruin their careers. 
In a telephone interview, Villalobos told us that ""a lot of felonies"" go through his program. A spokesman for his office said it did not have statistics on how many there have been. 
After examining the Travis County program’s web page, Villalobos said his program was similar. ""We don’t have anything as formal as a written application,"" he said. ""We have criteria, and we have forms they fill out if they are going to participate in the program."" First-time offenders who committed nonviolent crimes and did not resist law enforcement are eligible, according to documents Villalobos’ office shared with us. 
Villalobos told us that defense attorneys usually send a letter requesting that their clients be considered for the program. Prosecutors then review the request. Participants must meet conditions to stay in the program and agree to confess to their crime. As in Nacogdoches County, participants in Cameron County’s program are supervised by the local probation department. They also must pay a $500 fee to Villalobos’ office. 
People who complete the program have the charges against them dismissed, Villalobos said. 
Lehmberg, presented with our research, said she thought the Nacogdoches program was more similar to hers than the one in Cameron County, which also includes misdemeanors. She said there are some significant differences between the Travis County program and the others, highlighting the involvement of the local probation department in Cameron and Nacogdoches counties. She said the Travis program is geared toward people who don’t need that level of supervision. 
However, Lehmberg acknowledged that the programs have the same outcomes for successful participants: dismissal of charges upon completion. 
""As far as being the first,"" Lehmberg said, ""the Nacogdoches program appears similar to mine. If she went first, so be it. I just didn’t know"" that. 
Our ruling 
Lehmberg said the program she started in 2010 was the state’s first felony deferred prosecution program for nonviolent first-offenders. We found two similar, though not identical, programs in other counties. One was implemented the same year as Travis’, the other five years earlier. Since neither program shares all of the elements of Travis County’s, her claim retains an element of truth. But Travis County was not first.

Abrams: State per-capita spending among lowest in nation
","
State House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams thinks teachers and other government workers deserve salaries that rise with the cost of inflation.

She also thinks that many Georgians don’t want to pay for them, Abrams told attendees at a recent Atlanta Press Club luncheon. Consider state government spending numbers.

""Other than South Dakota -- and I think it’s because we just don’t have as many moose -- we have the lowest per-capita spending of any state in the nation,"" Abrams said in a March 27 speech.  

The second lowest per-capita spending of any state? We asked Abrams to tell us more.

(This item will not evaluate Abrams’ moose claim, though we warn her that she may receive calls from irate fans of South Dakota elk. Elk are common there. Their moose cousins tend to live further north and to the west. )

Leaders in Georgia and elsewhere regularly argue over whether state employees get enough pay. Some, such as state Rep. Jan Jones, a Republican from north Fulton County, argue that if you consider teacher benefits and salary package as a whole, they’re paid well.

PolitiFact Georgia gave Jones a Half True on a claim that Georgia ranks first nationally in teacher salary and benefits if you adjust for cost of living.

The new 2013 budget does not include cost-of-living pay raises for most of the state's more than 200,000 teachers and employees. They have not received them since shortly after the start of the Great Recession.

A 2011 analysis by USA Today shows that Georgia public employees make less than those in other states, but it’s not clear whether the study adjusts for the state’s cost of living.

Abrams pointed us to data from the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, a think tank that focuses on state issues, for more information on per-capita spending.

Generally speaking, state per-capita spending is the amount of money the state spends in a fiscal year on things such as salaries and services, divided by the state’s population. Policymakers often use the figure to argue that a state is spending too much or too little.  

GBPI sent us rankings its researchers made with data from the Tax Policy Center,  a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution think tanks. The Tax Policy Center’s research is widely used by experts with different political leanings.  

The Tax Policy Center’s data is based on numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual survey of state and local finances, which is a common source of information for state policy experts.

GBPI used 2009 data, the latest numbers available, to compare Georgia with other states and the District of Columbia.

Georgia spent $6,543.81 per capita, ranking 49th out of 51, or third from the bottom.

The two highest were Alaska and the District of Columbia. Alaska spent $17,802,  while D.C. spent $16,906.  Pennsylvania is at the median, spending $7,780  a year.

Abrams was close, but not quite on target.

Now, there’s more than one way to rank state spending per capita.

The GBPI ranked Georgia by a measure that combines spending by state and local governments.

Researchers often prefer this measure because statewide governments split the cost of services with their local counterparts in different ways, said Kim Rueben, a senior fellow with the Tax Policy Center.

For instance, one state may prefer to shoulder most of the costs of education on the state level, while others may prefer to fund education at the local level.

The census also collects spending by states only, so we took a look at its 2009 data.

Georgia was tied for last place in total state spending. It tied with Florida for second-to-last place in ""direct expenditures,"" a slightly different measure that excludes intergovernmental spending.

None of these data show South Dakota trailing Georgia in per-capita spending.

Regardless, these data all support Abrams’ broader point. In 2009, Georgia was near the bottom in state per-capita spending. According to one measure -- total state spending -- it’s tied for second.

E-mail says having an all-Democrat congressional delegation increased federal stimulus allotment by $460 per person
","
The 2009 federal stimulus package, designed to get the U.S. economy out of the Great Recession, continues to be controversial.

A chain e-mail making the rounds claims that states where all the U.S. senators and congressmen were Democrats got a lot more money, as calculated on a per-resident basis.

Headlined, ""It looks like our present administration is leading us down the path to economic failure as a country . . . ,"" the e-mail says, ""Stimulus dollars were highly correlated to which political party controlled the state: Having an entirely Democrat congressional delegation in 2009, when the bill passed, increases the per capita stimulus dollars that the state receives per person by $460.""

As a state where all four members of the congressional delegation are Democrats, we wondered if that were true.

Using data from Recovery.gov, which listed the amount each state has received per person, we found that the five states that had all-Democrat congressional delegations in 2009 -- Hawaii, Massachusetts, North Dakota, New Mexico and Rhode Island -- received an average of $1,209.80 per capita. That's $216 more than the average for the rest of the states, not $460.

And the five-state average is only $1.80 per person more than the lone state with NO Democrats in its congressional delegation -- Wyoming.

It turns out that the e-mail is quoting part of a March 23, 2012, opinion column at FoxNews.com by economist John R. Lott Jr.

Co-author (with conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist) of ""Debacle: Obama's War on Jobs and Growth and What We Can Do Now to Regain Our Future,"" Lott examines whether the states that needed the money most actually received it. We contacted him.

Lott sent us his spreadsheet that turned out to have more up-to-date -- and therefore larger -- numbers showing how much had been awarded by state.

Once again, we segregated the five all-Democrat states and looked at the average. It was $1,787 per resident.

That's an extra $338 per capita compared with the other states, but still significantly below $460.

So where did Lott's number come from?

If you create a graph that shows how much a state received per capita on one side and the percentage of Democrats in the congressional delegation on the other, you get a graph that looks like 50 drops of paint spattered against a wall.

But in this case, there is a pattern to that spattering. Lott uncovered it with a statistical analysis that turned the scattershot data into a straight line, indicating the overall trend. The lesson of the line: whenever Democratic representation increased by 10 percentage points, the per-person allotment in the state increased by $46.

Thus, he said, by that measure, going from 0 percent Democratic representation to 100 percent gives you an extra $460.

Plenty of individual states don't conform to this, as demonstrated by the fact that, using Lott's data, the only all-Republican state of Wyoming got more money than two of the five all-Democrat states.

(Lott did not include the District of Columbia, which has all Democrats in its non-voting delegation and has received five times more stimulus money per resident than the national average.)

Lott's analysis on FoxNews.com make it clear that he is looking at trends, noting, for example, that ""each one percentage point reduction in the percent of a state's workforce represented by unions saw a $26 drop in stimulus dollars per person.""

But the e-mail stripped out that context.

So why would the Democrat-heavy states get more money?

Democrats controlled the House and the Senate at the time the legislation was written and one provision, Lott said, was that ""a lot of the funding could only go for union jobs.""  Heavily Democratic areas are more likely to have unions, including government employee unions.

OUR RULING

The chain e-mail says, ""Having an entirely Democrat congressional delegation in 2009, when the [stimulus] bill passed, increases the per capita stimulus dollars that the state receives per person by $460.""

The original author of the claim calculated $460 using a sophisticated analysis to find a trend that considers the varying degree of Democrat and Republican representation in all states.

But that's a different question.

If you compare the all-Democrat states to all the other states, the correct number is closer to $338.

So states with a purely Democrat congressional delegation have, in fact, garnered quite a bit more money per capita than other states. But because the $460 amount is off by about 36 percent, we rate the statement Half True.

Energy group says Obama objects to energy exploration in Alaska
","
Bearing the bold title ""Nine Dollar Gas,"" a new ad by the American Energy Alliance attacks President Barack Obama’s energy policies and blames him for high gasoline prices.

It mentions the solar technology company Solyndra and the controversial Keystone oil pipeline, two issues with a tenuous-at-best relationship to what we’re currently paying at the pump.

The ad, released March 27, 2012, also says this: ""Obama opposed exploring for energy in Alaska.""

That’s the claim we’ll check here.

Source of the claim

On the screen beneath the Alaska claim is a citation for an Associated Press story dated Feb. 17, 2012. A spokesman for the American Energy Alliance, a conservative group tied to the industry-funded Institute for Energy Research, sent us a link to the story headlined ""House passes drilling-friendly energy package.""

The story was about a House plan to expand oil and gas drilling that was included in a $260 billion transportation bill.

""The legislation, which 21 Republicans voted against and 21 Democrats voted for, would open the eastern Gulf of Mexico off Florida and areas off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to drilling, lift a ban on drilling in a small portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and order leases to be offered for Western oil shale,"" the story said.

""Obama has said he would not pursue drilling off the Pacific and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and has pushed back offering leases in the Atlantic until at least 2017,"" it continued.

The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is an area about the size of South Carolina managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service to preserve habitat and protect birds, plants and animals such as caribou, polar bears and gray wolves.

While Obama has resisted efforts to drill for oil in the refuge, we found another Associated Press story dated the same day that clears the way for other drilling in the 49th state.

Under the headline ""With Obama's OK, Shell may soon start drilling for oil in arctic,"" the story said the White House had okayed Shell’s response plan for dealing with a spill in the Chukchi Sea, off Alaska's northwest coast, an important step before drilling can go forward. The company, which called the plan’s approval a ""major milestone,"" said it hopes to drill up to three wells there during the summer of 2012. It also plans two wells in the Beaufort Sea, off the northern coast. Shell’s disaster response plan for that area won approval in March.

The moves angered some environmentalists and native Alaskan groups, who questioned Shell’s claim in the Chukchi Sea plan that it would be able to clean up nearly all oil in the event of a spill. But Obama’s interior secretary, Ken Salazar, said any exploration in Alaska would be done ""under the strongest oversight, safety requirements and emergency response plans ever established,"" according to the AP story.

Our ruling

The American Energy Alliance ad said that Obama ""opposed exploring for energy in Alaska.""

That’s a narrow slice of reality. It’s true that the president opposes opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, but the administration has approved plans that allow for expanded drilling in other parts of Alaska, including clearing a process that could let Shell sink new rigs in two Alaskan offshore areas as soon as summer 2012.

The ad leaves out that significant piece of the picture. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2012/apr/02/american-energy-alliance/energy-group-says-obama-objects-energy-exploration/

Knopp left the Oregon House in 2005, after serving three terms. He said that when he left the Legislature, the state, and Central Oregon, were in much better shape. For example, unemployment in the area was 6 percent.

""Today unemployment has been running near 12 percent or more for the last four years and the Legislature has stalled on critical job legislation, additional PERS reforms, school choice expansion, and efforts to protect small businesses, seniors and veterans,"" Knopp writes on his campaign website.

On one level, this is a statement of fact. When Knopp left the House, unemployment was much lower. On another level, he’s criticizing his opponent, Telfer, for failing to do anything about unemployment. Is that fair? How much of the high unemployment can be blamed on the Legislature? On the flip side, can he take credit for lower unemployment?  

In a phone interview, Knopp confirmed he is calling out the Legislature and, specifically, Telfer, for failing to focus on jobs. Knopp criticized Telfer for running for state treasurer after winning her state Senate seat in 2008; there wasn’t much jobs action in 2011, he said, and just a little more in 2012.

""There are 27 counties that are doing better than Deschutes County right now,"" Knopp said. ""We need to do better and the focus needs to be on jobs, and that’s a good portion of why I’m running.""
 
Senate District 27 is wholly within Deschutes County. Central Oregon includes Deschutes, Jefferson and Crook counties.

You can see by the unemployment numbers that Bend/Deschutes suffered during the recession. 


Knopp is correct that when he left office in January 2005, unemployment for both Bend and Deschutes County were at 6 percent. Jobless figures started creeping up in 2008. The recession officially started in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. Oregon tends to lag the nation in downturn and recovery.

Knopp is largely correct in saying that in Deschutes County, unemployment hovered at 12 percent or more for the last four years. (We will give him the 11.6 percent in January 2012, although we should note that it’s dropped to 11.3 percent in February 2012.)

But again, just how much sway do state legislators have in the face of a global recession?

We turned to the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis, where they have a good description of the region’s economic history. Basically, Central Oregon has enjoyed large growth. Employment grew 4.8 percent per year, on average, from 1983 through 2007. By contrast, Oregon grew 2.4 percent per year. The region benefited from more people moving in and a boom in housing. Then the bubble burst, spectacularly.

Tom Potiowsky, who did two tours as Oregon state economist, says Deschutes County was caught up in the national housing frenzy. Home prices soared. Anyone could get a loan, with hardly any credit. He doesn’t know how legislators could have foreseen that and stopped the building boom -- or, in the aftermath, shed the oversupply of homes.

""Deschutes County was probably one of the hardest hit counties in the housing problem,"" he said.    

Richard Read, a reporter at The Oregonian, wrote in May 2009 of Bend’s rise and fall: 

""Fair or not, Bend -- the nation's sixth-fastest-growing metro area early this decade -- soared the highest and crashed the hardest of any community in Oregon. The city's volcanic housing market of just a few years ago has collapsed into a sea of foreclosures, bankruptcies and plant closures.""
   
Here’s the evidence. Residential construction permits went from 922 in 2005 to 220 in 2008, and to 97 in 2010, according to Deschutes County. 
Carolyn Eagan, regional economist with the employment department, says that the jobless rate peaked in 2009, ""but we still have a lot of people who were unemployed in fields that were related to housing that continue to look for work."" 
We’re not sure what the Legislature could have done. Certainly some lawmakers, including Knopp, will argue that they could have done something to buck up the area.

Knopp was in office during the 2001 recession. Unemployment crept up to 8.2 percent in Bend, but Oregon’s economic analysts say that recession didn’t affect the area that much. ""Both the 1990 and 2001 recessions had little net impact on local employment, partially due to continued strong population growth and also the industrial structure … However the collapse of the housing bubble brought extreme levels of job loss to the region.""

In 2010, PolitiFact Oregon analyzed a similar claim by then-GOP gubernatorial candidate Chris Dudley, who said that unemployment rose 65 percent under the watch of former Gov. John Kitzhaber. We found that while Kitzhaber didn’t help the situation -- businesses could have used help navigating land-use regulations -- there wasn’t much a governor could do about the 2001 recession. (We gave it a Half True.)

We think the same way here. Knopp appears to be as responsible for a 6 percent unemployment figure as Telfer is for a 12 percent unemployment rate, and that’s not very much. His figures are correct, making the statement partially accurate, but there’s important information missing: The context of a global recession.

President Barack Obama says, ""Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour""
","
President Barack Obama, making the case from the Rose Garden that oil companies would be just fine without tax breaks, offered this striking figure: Last year, he said, ""Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour.""

We had to know: Is that true?

Here’s the excerpt from the March 29, 2012, speech:

""It’s not as if these companies can’t stand on their own. Last year, the three biggest U.S. oil companies took home more than $80 billion in profits. Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour.""

Here’s the math:

Exxon Mobil Corp. estimates it earned $41 billion in 2011.

Divide by 365 days in the year and 24 hours in a day — and that’s $4.67 million.

Every hour.

Obama has previously struggled with the facts about Exxon’s profit. In 2007, he claimed the company’s profits had never been higher, when that wasn’t true at the time.

Last year, Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., was on stronger ground when he declared that ""over the past decade, the big five oil companies — BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell — made a total profit of nearly $1 trillion."" PolitiFact Virginia rated that Mostly True.

This time, Exxon answered the president on its blog, saying ""the reality is that statistics such as by-the-hour profits only tell part of the story.""

""Consider if the president had added the following statistics: ExxonMobil’s taxes were $12.3 million an hour, and it took more than $47 million an hour to run the global business. Those statistics are also accurate and they put the $4.7 million an hour in profits in context.""

(We should note that we can’t independently verify the company’s tax bill. As we’ve reported before, the actual income tax, for example, paid by Exxon to the U.S. government is confidential information. We have dinged politicians for inaccurately characterizing the company’s taxes.)

The company has a point that Obama’s statistic doesn't detail the oil company's expenses. But in this fact-check, we’re focusing just on the claim that, ""Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour."" As a simple snapshot of Exxon’s 2011 profit, his arithmetic is right on target.
