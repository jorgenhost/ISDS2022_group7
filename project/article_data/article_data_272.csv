Advance child tax credit payments won’t usually require repayment
","Many American households with children saw their bank account balances increase on July 15 as the IRS began distributing the first in a series of advance child tax credit payments.  The early payments of the child tax credit — which was increased as part of the American Rescue Plan Act — will continue through December 2021 to families of children ages 17 and under. Ultimately, the advance payments will distribute half of a family’s expected total child tax credit for 2021. Families will receive the other half of the credit when they file their taxes. Although many view the payments as a positive step, others took to social media to express their concerns.  ""I see a lot of people celebrating #BidenBucks like its free money,"" reads one since-deleted tweet. ""This is a dollar-for-dollar advance on your taxes. You must give EVERY PENNY of it back when you file next year. It's different from the stimulus money you may have received in 2020 (didn't require repayment)."" We found similar tweets elsewhere, including one that called the credit a ""bait & switch"" and another that described it as a ""scam."" Will people have to pay back the money they receive from the advance payments?  It’s possible, but there are mechanisms in place to prevent that from happening — particularly for the most vulnerable families. In many cases, taxpayers will not have to pay back the money received via the advance child tax credit payments. On its website, the IRS explains that the payments are ""early payments from the IRS of 50% of the estimated amount of the Child Tax Credit that you may properly claim on your 2021 tax return during the 2022 tax filing season."" A family with a child age 17 or younger that has an adjusted gross income of less than $240,000 per year for a single filer or less than $440,000 per year for a couple filing jointly should be eligible to receive at least some portion of the 2021 child tax credit.  To determine eligibility for the advance payments and to estimate the child tax credit a family will earn, the IRS used 2020 tax returns (or 2019 tax returns if a family’s 2020 return has not yet been processed.)  Because the advanced child tax credit payments are based on an estimate of the 2021 tax credit a family will be eligible for, it is possible some families might have to pay back some of the money.  ""If the total (amount of advance Child Tax Credit payments) is greater than the Child Tax Credit amount that you are allowed to claim on your 2021 tax return, you may have to repay the excess amount on your 2021 tax return during the 2022 tax filing season,"" the IRS explained. If a child turns 18 in 2021, for example, that could result in the IRS overestimating a family’s expected child tax credit. It is worth noting that the IRS routinely gets information from the Social Security Administration on valid Social Security numbers, which can be used to determine age. But if, for some reason, a family receives advance payments for a child who is no longer eligible in 2021, the money will likely have to be paid back.  Divorced parents who alternate the years they claim their children as dependents might also encounter a situation where the IRS might send child tax credit payments that would need to be paid back. But there are protections in place to prevent families from encountering a situation where they would have to pay money back, according to Elaine Maag, a tax policy expert and principal research associate at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. She said research shows that very low-income families are the most likely to have changing child custody situations or to have experienced a marriage or divorce. To protect those families from having to pay back money, there is a ""hold harmless"" provision in the law.  ""It essentially says if you’re single and have income of under about $40,000, you’re at no risk of paying back erroneous payments,"" Maag said.  Married couples making up to $60,000 are also protected from having to pay back overpayments of up to $2,000 per child because of the hold harmless provision. If a family’s income drastically increased in 2021 compared to the income indicated on the 2020 (or 2019) tax return the IRS used to estimate the family’s tax credit, the outdated information could result in overpayments of the credit that might have to be paid back.  ""It would reduce your refund or increase your tax payment next April,"" April Walker, lead manager of tax practice and ethics at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, told CNBC. ""That’s how it would be paid back."" Maag said she believes that drastic increases in income resulting in overpayments of the tax credit ""will be rare"" because families will receive the maximum amount of the child tax credit if they earn anywhere between $0 and $75,000 as a single filer (or $112,500 for head of household) or $150,000 for joint filers.  ""Most people won’t go from $0 to a $300,000 per year earnings,"" she said. ""I don’t think that situation will be extremely common.""  She noted that even if a family’s income went from $20,000 a year to $300,000 a year, the family’s child tax credit would only decrease from $3,000 to $2,000 per child. ""Only half of that is being advanced, so it’s not a huge liability,"" Maag said. ""And that’s a really high-income family. They can probably absorb that change in their taxes."" The payments are not taxable income. They are tax credits that reduce a family’s tax bill. Families can choose to opt out of the monthly payments in favor of receiving their child tax credit as a lump sum after filing their taxes using the IRS’s Child Tax Credit Update Portal. The deadline to opt out is about two weeks before a payment is made.  The only way a family will have to pay back the money received in the advanced payments is if the household actually qualifies for a smaller 2021 child tax credit than what the IRS estimated when distributing the payments.  Ultimately, Maag said ""we don’t know the exact answer"" to how many families this might impact. A tweet said that ""you must give EVERY PENNY"" of the advance child tax credit payments back when you file your 2021 taxes. Because the IRS calculated eligibility for the payments based on a family’s 2020 tax return, it is possible that some families, such as those whose incomes dramatically increased in 2021 or parents who alternate claiming children as dependents, could have to pay some money back.  However, ""must"" communicates a sense of certainty that is at odds with the reality of the situation. And even families that end up having to pay back some of the child credit will not necessarily have to pay back ""EVERY PENNY."" Finally, the law includes protections in place to ensure the lowest-income families will not have to pay back erroneous payments.  We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/jul/21/tweets/advance-child-tax-credit-payments-wont-usually-req/

Fact-checking Tomi Lahren on vaccines and COVID-19 survival chances
","Is a person’s chance of surviving COVID-19 the same, vaccinated or not? ""Unvaccinated, you can get COVID and have over 99% chance of survival,"" conservative commentator Tomi Lahren said on Facebook, where she has 4.8 million followers. ""Get vaccinated and you can STILL get COVID and will still have over 99% chance of survival."" Her post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Vaccines don’t offer 100% protection. Some vaccinated people will get COVID-19, and some of them will die. But Lahren’s claim incorrectly conflates survival rates for the population at large with an individual’s chances of survival, which can vary widely depending on individual circumstances. And in suggesting that vaccines don’t make a difference, Lahren ignores evidence showing vaccines are highly effective at preventing infections that could cause death. ""The statement is really well written to be misleading,"" said Cindy Prins, an epidemiology professor at the University of Florida. ""The interpretation could easily be that there’s no difference between unvaccinated and being vaccinated, in terms of chances of survival. But it leaves out what vaccines do in preventing disease in the first place. ""The vaccine is preventing the vast amount of cases that you would have had,"" Prins added. ""And if you reduce the risk of becoming a case, then you can’t die from COVID.""  Lahren, a Fox Nation talk show host, did not reply to our request for information to support her claim.  More than 609,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S. Estimates of the U.S. case fatality rate — the ratio of confirmed deaths to confirmed cases — are around 1.8%, according to the U.K. nonprofit Our World in Data and Johns Hopkins University. (Among the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19, case fatality rates range from 0.8% in Thailand and Malaysia, to 9.3% in Peru, according to Johns Hopkins.) Adding in unconfirmed cases — those without a positive test result — would likely bring the U.S. mortality rate below 1%, suggesting a survival rate of over 99%.  However, experts say that the survival rate for the infected population at large is not the same as an individual’s chance of survival after getting the disease. The chance of survival for a given individual or demographic group depends on a host of factors, including age and health history. Figures from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show how just one factor — age — increases the risk of death for a person with COVID-19.  The CDC uses people in the 18-to-29 age group as a benchmark, because that age group has accounted for the largest cumulative number of COVID-19 cases. For people in the 30-to-39 age group, the risk of dying from COVID-19 is four times as high. The risk increases for each older group, with people aged 85 and over being 600 times as likely to die. These figures don’t take into account other risk factors, such as preexisting health conditions, that would affect a person’s chances of dying. Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said that for 20-year-olds broadly, getting vaccinated probably wouldn't reduce their mortality rate much, but for 85-year-olds, it would go down significantly. By comparing survival rates for infected people with and without vaccinations, Lahren’s claim also ignores a significant factor: the impact of vaccinations in preventing infections in the first place.  A report published July 7 by the Commonwealth Fund found that without a vaccination program, by the end of June 2021 there would have been about 279,000 additional deaths. The Associated Press reported that only about 150 of the more than 18,000 COVID-19 deaths in May were in fully vaccinated people, according to its analysis of CDC data. That translates to about 0.8%, meaning 99.2% of the deaths were among people who were not fully vaccinated. Preliminary data for June show a similar pattern: 99.5% of deaths from COVID-19 in a collection of states occurred in unvaccinated people, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at a White House briefing July 1. The CDC’s latest data on so-called breakthrough cases says that as of July 12, more than 159 million people had been fully vaccinated. With 48 states and territories reporting, there were 5,492 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among them, and 1,063 deaths. That included 272 deaths that were reported as not related to COVID-19 or in which there were no COVID-19 symptoms. Lahren said: ""Unvaccinated, you can get COVID and have over 99% chance of survival. Get vaccinated and you can still get COVID and will still have over 99% chance of survival."" Mortality data shows that some 99% of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. do not result in death, but the survival rate for the population at large is not the same as an infected individual’s chance of survival, which depends on many risk factors. The claim also leaves out important context: the role of vaccines in preventing infections that could lead to death. Preliminary data indicate that in recent months, more than 99% of COVID-19 deaths have been among people who have not been vaccinated. The claim contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression — our definition of Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/jul/21/tomi-lahren/fact-checking-tomi-lahren-vaccines-and-covid-19-su/

How much CO2 did Bezos’ rocket ride release? Close to zero
","When uber-billionaire Jeff Bezos blasted off from a launchpad in Texas for a fast and short trip to near-space, he ignited a burst of claims about the outsized carbon footprint of his adventure. ""Today Jeff Bezos will put 300 tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere for 180 seconds in space,"" said one tweet July 20. Other social posts made the same general point. ""If you are reporting on the Bezos space flight … please mention the carbon emissions."" ""They really should given Bezos trip today = more carbon pollution than avg person’s whole life but oddly most in media refuse to punch up when it comes to climate."" In terms Americans might more clearly understand, the claim is that about 330 tons of carbon dioxide were emitted for Bezos and three companions to ride to a point about 60 miles above the Earth before coming back down. The round trip lasted about 10 minutes, of which about three were spent in weightlessness. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is one of a handful of private rocketeers aiming to turn space travel into a viable business. His company is called Blue Origin. Given the clouds of dust and fiery plume that come with any launch, it might seem likely that greenhouse gases would be part of the picture. In the case of the engine used in the Blue Origin rocket, that assumption is wrong. Conventional rocket fuels are carbon-based. The BE-3 engine developed by Bezos’ company burns liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.  ""Carbon dioxide isn’t emitted from the Blue Origin rocket that was used for today’s launch,"" said Eloise Marais, an air pollution researcher at University College London. The Guardian newspaper cited Marais in an article about how the rush of billionaires to get to space could dump massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Marais told The Guardian that typically, rockets release 200 to 300 metric tons of carbon dioxide during launch. That didn’t apply to the Blue Origin rocket, Marais said — but the erroneous tweets shared the article in making the claim about Blue Origin anyway. At a press conference after returning from space, Bezos said the Blue Origin rocket used ""​​the most environmentally benign propellant you can choose."" Other private companies — SpaceX, controlled by billionaire Elon Musk, and Virgin Galactic, which took owner Richard Branson into space a week before Bezos — use conventional fuels, and do release carbon dioxide. The Blue Origin flight isn’t a net zero for the environment, however. Marais and other researchers warn that every rocket poses a threat to the ozone layer. Whether it’s water vapor and nitrogen oxides from a Blue Origin engine, or particles from conventional rocket fuels, both degrade the ozone.  We should note that it takes a lot of energy to make most of the hydrogen used today. Those carbon emissions wouldn't come from the launch itself, but they are the reason there's a big push to expand ""green"" hydrogen production. ""In the stratosphere, nitrogen oxides and chemicals formed from the breakdown of water vapour convert ozone into oxygen, depleting the ozone layer which guards life on Earth against harmful UV radiation,"" Marais wrote in The Conversation July 19. Social media users tweeted that Bezos’ brief trip to space released 300 metric tons of carbon dioxide.  The trip released none. The rocket’s engine burns hydrogen and oxygen to carry it away from Earth. That doesn’t make these rides risk-free. They do pose a threat to the ozone layer.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/jul/20/tweets/how-much-co2-did-bezos-rocket-ride-release-close-z/

No, saline injections are not part of a COVID-19 vaccine plot
","A meme being shared on social media suggests there’s a nefarious plot to kill vaccine recipients because of reports of some people receiving shots of just saline.  ""Some of you are being injected with saline because it would look too suspicious if everybody died at the same time,"" the post says.  It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In April, news outlets reported that some people mistakenly got saline shots instead of a COVID-19 vaccine at a Walgreens in North Carolina. Walgreens said a ""limited number"" of people at a store received saline injections, according to the Charlotte Observer. Walgreens notified the customers and they were given the COVID-19 vaccine when they returned to the pharmacy.   One woman told a local TV station that Walgreens called them hours after they received their vaccines asking them to come back in because she said ""the pharmacists evidently forgot to mix the vaccine into the saline solution.""  A couple months later, in June, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control said that a ""very limited"" number of COVID-19 vaccines reportedly contained only saline, according to WIS-TV, a local NBC News affiliate.  A woman said that she was called back to the pharmacy she had visited to receive her second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine because it was ""not activated."" A health department spokesperson said that there were some similar cases and that in each instance, the recipient was contacted to return for the proper vaccine dose.  And back in March, several patients in Ontario, Canada, were accidentally injected with saline instead of the vaccine, according to Newsweek. Saline is used to dilute the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer before it’s injected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that the preparation instructions for the vaccine direct medical providers to mix it with sterile 0.9% sodium chloride, which is saline.  The Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines don’t require mixing with saline. This detailed graphic by the Chicago Tribune shows how all three COVID-19 vaccines that have been authorized for use in the United States make their way from manufacturing sites to arms. Receiving a saline injection isn’t harmful, and millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses have been safely administered in the United States. A rigorous regulatory process and real-world evidence shows that they effectively protect against COVID-19, and the vaccines continue to undergo safety monitoring.  While the CDC has said that three deaths from a rare blood clotting issue could be linked to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, more than 160 million Americans are now fully vaccinated with minimal complications.  The suggestion that people are being injected with saline as part of a bigger, deadly plot against humanity is unfounded and defies evidence.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/jul/20/viral-image/no-saline-injections-are-not-part-covid-19-vaccine/

Wisconsin state justice misses mark on how much waste produced by cows at factory farms
","It’s no secret that factory farms produce a lot of waste.  Also known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, or CAFOs, the farms are home to thousands of animals at a time, ranging from cows to hogs to chickens. One of the most common complaints about the large-scale farms is the waste, which must be collected and disposed of in some way.  It’s no surprise that a case involving the waste from factory farms made its way to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, though the written decision in the case raised an interesting question: Exactly how much waste does a CAFO produce?  The court held that the state Department of Natural Resources has the ability to impose a maximum number of animals on factory farms and off-site groundwater monitoring conditions on factory farms. In writing the majority decision, Justice Jill Karofsky cited an evaluation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which stated that ""a farm with 2,500 dairy cattle is similar in waste load to a city of 411,000 people.""  But in America’s Dairyland, we know our cows. And that number seems awfully high.  Is it true that a dairy farm of 2,500 cows could really produce more waste than the population Madison, Racine and Oshkosh combined?  Let’s check it out.  If you look at the study referenced by Karofsky, ""Risk Assessment Evaluation for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations,"" it does indeed state that a farm of 2,500 animals produces as much waste as a city of 411,000.  But, the paper was published in 2004, making it 17 years old.  So we went in search of newer information.  A Dec. 6, 2019 report by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel likened a herd of 1,000 cows to the city of Fond du Lac, which has 42,000 residents. So, by that measure, 2,500 cows would equal a city of about 105,000 --  much smaller than Karofsky wrote. The article also noted the largest CAFO in the state, which boasts 6,000 cows, generates about as much manure and urine as 252,000 people, roughly the size of the city of Madison. So, at 2,500 cows, the comparison point would again be a city of about 105,000. And studies by Cornell University animal science department professors Michael Van Amburgh and Karl Czymmek, published in 2017, showed that a herd of about 340 cows can produce the same amount of waste as 10,736 humans.  That puts the amount of waste for a herd of 2,500 cows at about the same level as 79,000 humans, a smaller number, but one even further under the number cited in the state high court’s opinion. In writing a recent decision for the state Supreme Court, Karofsky claimed a herd of 2,500 cows produces as much waste as a city of 411,000 people. The statistic was part of a case that upheld the state DNR’s ability to consider the number of animals at factory farms and whether groundwater should be monitored offsite.  That’s an awful lot of waste from a lot of cows. And a 17-year-old study included the figure. But newer numbers suggest that while cows produce a lot of waste -- up to 17 gallons of it a day, per animal -- a farm of 2,500 cows isn’t producing the same amount of waste as 411,000 people. It’s more like 100,000 people. We’re going to have to call bull on this claim.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/jul/20/jill-karofsky/wisconsin-state-justice-misses-mark-how-much-waste/

The warehouse was an unlikely place for a burglary … But someone tried to do it anyway, and at just the perfect moment, 20 minutes after deputies in charge of guarding the warehouse left their post. By the time those deputies returned to check out the alarm, someone had opened the hundred-pound door to the warehouse. So what happened that night? And why? We still don’t know."" We do know. In fact, a photograph Carlson aired on screen came from a Georgia Public Broadcasting report that explained what happened.  A screenshot of a ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" segment about alleged voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia, as seen on July 14, 2021. The alarm that rang did not come from the part of the building housing ballots, reporter Stephen Fowler wrote in June. And the door was opened by off-duty police officers. The kicker: The officers who opened it had been hired as private security by an attorney representing several plaintiffs in the lawsuit seeking access to Fulton County’s ballots — the very people seeking to prove Georgia’s election was marred by fraud. Barron, the elections director, said the alarm was tied to a motion detector in an office belonging to the clerk of the superior court, likely triggered by a rodent.  When it sounded, the Fulton County Sheriff’s deputies watching the building were changing shifts, he said. That left an opening for the litigants’ hired security to approach the building. Barron said that the county clerk had accidentally left a door unlocked, and that those officers had ""illegally trespassed"" when they opened it and entered. He said they ""staged photos to make it look as though the door was wide open.""  The ballots inside remained secured.  Carlson’s second allegation: that Fulton County counted thousands of ballots more than once.  Carlson said VoterGA identified more than 4,000 votes that were duplicates in Fulton County. He also cited an Atlanta Journal-Constitution report about potential double-scanned ballots in the initial count. ""The final tally from the double counts we know about amounts to more than 3,300 votes for Joe Biden and 865 votes for Donald Trump,"" Carlson said. He added: ""We're talking about a lot of ballots, at least hundreds of ballots involved, enough potentially to affect the outcome of the election."" Election workers do sometimes make errors, and Fulton County has had a history of messy elections, said Charles S. Bullock III, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia. But a similar claim that over 4,000 of the county’s ballots were scanned multiple times was rated False by PolitiFact.  ""There is no evidence that thousands of ballots were counted twice,"" said Amber McReynolds, chief executive officer of the National Vote at Home Institute. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the county may have scanned nearly 200 ballots twice before the state’s recounts. But the newspaper added that ""there’s no indication any vote for president was counted more than once in official results."" Georgia conducted a hand audit and a machine recount of ballots, both of which upheld Biden’s victory. For a ballot to have counted twice in the official results, it would have had to be scanned twice in the initial tally, then counted twice again during the hand audit and machine recount. ""The chance that you are going to double scan the same batch again is, like you might as well win the lottery,"" Barron said. ""I think the odds are worse.""  Fulton County Ga. elections director Richard Barron listens during a press conference while workers scan ballots as part of Georgia's presidential recount on Nov. 25, 2020, in Atlanta. (AP) On screen, Carlson showed a video of an election worker feeding ballots through a machine and said it ""appears to show large numbers of ballots being scanned multiple times."" But it’s typical for election workers to have to cancel and rescan some batches of ballots, experts said. The practice is not fraudulent double-counting. It’s what election workers in Fulton County and elsewhere are instructed to do when machines jam up or fail to scan a ballot. Investigators looked into allegations of fraud in Fulton County and found nothing, the Georgia secretary of state’s office told PolitiFact. The recounts corrected some mistakes that had no bearing on the outcome, including in two counties that went for Trump. ""There’s never been an election held in Georgia which has been checked so many different ways,"" said Bullock.  Carlson claimed that VoterGA had found ""falsified"" audit tally sheets with ""fabricated vote totals,"" including sheets that logged hundreds of votes for Biden and zero for other candidates. ""It certainly sounds like flat-out criminal fraud,"" he said. The source for the claim, again, was VoterGA’s July 13 press release. PolitiFact reached out to the group for more details and did not hear back in time for publication. But the hand audit in which these tally sheets were used did not produce Georgia’s final, certified results, Barron said. The state’s machine recount did, and it confirmed Biden’s victory. As for the sheets VoterGA said only tallied votes for Biden, Barron said they were likely the result of election workers sorting ballots by candidate during the audit.  ""They would put these into piles, and then on the tally sheet, they would mark the number of votes cast according to the count of each of those piles,"" Barron said. A photo from the audit shows an election worker doing just that, as USA Today reported. The outlet also reported that there were similar batches from the audit with all votes tallied for Trump. ""Since they did use the sorting method during the recount, it is possible for a batch to look like that,"" McReynolds told PolitiFact.  An election worker looks at a ballot during Georgia's hand recount of presidential votes on Nov. 15, 2020, in Marietta, Ga. (AP) Carlson said a ""whistleblower"" had captured photos of mail-in ballots without creases.  ""That's strange because of course mail-in ballots need to be bent in order to be mailed in,"" he said as the images ran on screen. ""These ballots clearly had never been inside an envelope."" But many military and overseas voters receive electronic ballots that they print, fill out and return by mail, Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voting system implementation manager, told the New York Times in January. These ballots are not the right size for scanners, so election workers under supervision transfer those votes onto normal ballots so the scanners can read them. The same process occurs for ballots that get torn in the scanner, sliced when opening the envelope, or too wrinkled and bent in the mail. During the 2020 election, the process was also standard procedure in Georgia’s Republican counties, CNN’s Daniel Dale reported. ""It is absolutely not proof of fraud,"" McReynolds said.  A Fulton County elections worker processes absentee ballots at the State Farm Arena on Nov. 2, 2020, in Atlanta. (AP) Carlson's final claim was that thousands of Georgia voters cast ballots from old addresses. ""Nearly 35,000 Georgia voters moved out of their county of residence more than a month prior to Election Day,"" Carlson said. ""They were ineligible to vote. And yet they did."" The source for Carlson’s claim was an article from the Federalist, a conservative website. The article said the figure came from an expert who compared the U.S. Postal Service’s national change-of-address database with data from Georgia’s secretary of state. The secretary of state’s office told PolitiFact it disputed the claim. And an address change for the purpose of receiving mail is not itself proof of a change in residency that would affect voting.  Some college students might continue to vote from their home address while they go to school, Bullock said. Military members stationed at one of Georgia’s many bases could do the same. The Federalist’s article acknowledged what Carlson did not — that those people ""may have been students, members of the military, or may have only relocated temporarily."" Carlson said, ""It now appears there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia last November. That is not a conspiracy theory. It's true."" To back his claim, the Fox News host rattled off several claims purporting to show signs of fraud. Each was inaccurate, misleading or unsubstantiated, PolitiFact found. Biden’s victory in Georgia was confirmed by two recounts. We rate Carlson’s claim False.",/factchecks/2021/jul/20/tucker-carlson/tucker-carlson-spins-web-misleading-claims-he-alle/

Downstate senator wrong on Medicaid eligibility for Illinois undocumented immigrants
","Last year amid the global COVID-19 crisis, Illinois became the first state to expand publicly funded healthcare to all low-income immigrant seniors, including those living in the country illegally. In a recent WJPF radio interview, state Sen. Terri Bryant of Murphysboro brought up the program after a caller asked how many ""illegal aliens"" taxpayers in Illinois ""are now responsible for."" Bryant used the question to criticize Illinois for being too soft on illegal immigration, suggesting without evidence the state’s policies are somehow connected with violent crime in Chicago and repeating a consistently debunked claim about the city having the nation’s strictest gun laws. She also took aim at the state for expanding health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, suggesting those over a certain age are now eligible for health care benefits not available to citizens: ""In this budget, we now allow for Medicaid for undocumented individuals who are 55 and older,"" the Republican said. ""So last year — it seemed like it stayed very quiet, I don’t know why more people weren’t talking about it — it was 65 and older. This year they slipped in 55 and older. So you may be 55 years old in this state and a citizen and not eligible for Medicaid. But if you are an undocumented immigrant and 55 or older, you’re eligible for Medicaid."" We were curious what Bryant was talking about when she said being undocumented and 55 years or older would make someone eligible for Medicaid benefits in Illinois. After all, Medicaid is a need-based program, meaning only applicants who meet certain income requirements qualify. We called Bryant’s office to speak with her about what her claim was based on, but did not hear back. Undocumented immigrants face limited access to healthcare, with federal law restricting them from participating in Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplaces. In addition to becoming the first state to provide coverage for low-income seniors whose immigration status disqualifies them from federal programs, Illinois is one of six states funding its own program to cover income-eligible children regardless of immigration status. California, one of the other states that covers minors, expanded its program to include young adults in 2020 and last week approved a plan to cover low-income immigrants age 50 and over beginning next year. Illinois moved to create two programs expanding coverage for older immigrants left out of federal programs. Last year, state lawmakers used the budget to create a program providing noncitizens living at or below the federal poverty level who are at least 65 years old with access to some Medicaid-like benefits regardless of their immigration status. The age and income requirements for that program mirror those for a version of Medicaid called Aid to the Aged, Blind, and Disabled, though the benefits for the immigrant seniors are not as expansive. The budget lawmakers and the governor approved this year created a program set to launch by the end of next May providing benefits identical to Medicaid to noncitizens aged 55 through 64 who would be eligible for Medicaid if not for their immigration status. Under Medicaid itself in Illinois, U.S. citizens and noncitizens with legal status 19 years and older are eligible for coverage if their income is within 138% of the federal poverty level. That same income requirement applies to noncitizens who will be eligible for the state’s new program, according to Jane Longo, deputy director of new initiatives at the Illinois Department of Healthcare & Family Services. So, with the exception of immigration status, a 55-year-old who is undocumented would have to meet the same criteria as a 55-year-old citizen to qualify for coverage in Illinois. Bryant drew a false comparison, since there’s no scenario in which U.S. citizens would fail to qualify for Medicaid, as long as they fell within the proper income range. Bryant said ""you may be 55 years old in this state and a citizen and not eligible for Medicaid. But if you are an undocumented immigrant and 55 or older, you're eligible for Medicaid."" This is a false comparison. No U.S. citizens would be barred from Medicaid unless their income was too high to qualify. And the beneficiaries of the Illinois plan who are in the U.S. illegally would also have to fall below the same income restrictions.

No proof of thousands of double-counted ballots in 2020 presidential race in Ga.
","In a continuing attempt to portray Fulton County, Ga., as a haven for fraud and malfeasance in the 2020 presidential election, a new allegation asserts that thousands of the same ballots were counted multiple times in the county where heavily Democratic Atlanta is located. One tweet claims the counts benefited Joe Biden, who defeated Donald Trump in Georgia, a key swing state, by about 12,000 votes. ""Why is it that errors seem to only ever go one way?"" the tweet asked. ""VoterGA says 4,255 ballots in Fulton County, Georgia were scanned multiple times. Of those duplicate ballots, 3,390 went to Biden."" Claims of the multiple counting of the same ballots in Fulton County were also made on Facebook. And Trump, also citing the VoterGA group, issued a statement making allegations, including fraud, in the county’s ballot counting. The tweet was highlighted to PolitiFact by Vinesight, a company that monitors online misinformation. Citing a history of election mismanagement in Fulton County, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on July 15 called for the firing of two of the county’s top election officials.  But there is no evidence of double-counting that would have given Biden anywhere near the number of extra votes being claimed. The double-counting that VoterGA claims it found were in what is known as a risk-limiting audit — a hand recount of the vote. After that, a second recount was done.  Statewide, the original count plus the two recounts all confirmed Biden’s victory in Georgia Voter GA, also known as Voters Organized for Trusted Election Results in Georgia, says it advocates for ""verifiable auditable recount capable and transparent elections."" It is led by Garland Favorito who, with others, filed a lawsuit seeking a review of the Fulton County’s general-election absentee ballots in the 2020 election.  A longtime critic of Georgia’s election infrastructure, Favorito has promoted conspiracy theories about 9/11 and other topics, according to Georgia Public Radio, the New York Times and the Associated Press. He has also promoted affidavits signed by poll workers or observers in which they leap to conclusions about the integrity of absentee ballots, suggesting they weren’t properly marked or weren’t printed on normal paper.  On July 13, Favorito and the group issued a news release that makes allegations of fraud and other election malfeasance in Fulton County, including the allegation referenced in the tweet. The group claimed it ""found at least 36 batches of mail-in ballots with 4,255 total extra votes were redundantly added into Fulton County audit results for the November election. These illicit votes include 3,390 extra votes for Joe Biden, 865 extra votes for Donald Trump and 43 extra votes for Jo Jorgenson,"" the Libertarian candidate.  At a news conference on July 13, businessman David Cross, who is helping Favorito, displayed digital images of several ballots that he said shows ballots were scanned twice. Side by side, the ballots appeared to be identical, but contained different markings that Cross said indicated they were scanned more than once. Cross sent PolitiFact, and posted online, information that he said supports the Voter GA’s claim. He went further, claiming that he had found 6,415 extra votes counted in the risk-limiting audit, with an extra 5,128 going to Biden and 1,188 to Trump.  On the same day of the tweet, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the people who filed the lawsuit discovered that nearly 200 Fulton County ballots had been scanned twice. The newspaper said it confirmed the double-counting by reviewing digital images of the ballots; the story included a link to the images.  However, the double-counting was discovered in a recount and there is no indication Biden earned any additional votes in the official results, the newspaper said. The ballots counted twice would have given Biden 31 extra votes. After a recount, official results reflected that Trump gained a total of 121 absentee votes in Fulton. Biden won the county with 73% of 524,000 votes cast, the story said. As we’ve reported, two recounts confirmed Biden won Georgia. In all, the roughly 5 million ballots cast in Georgia were counted three times, including once by hand. The hand recount uncovered more than 2,600 uncounted votes, most of which favored Trump, in Floyd County, Ga. But election officials said the mistake was due to human error, not voter fraud. In the end, the certified results showed Biden beating Trump by 11,779 votes in the state.  Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta, said: ""Given that these ballots were all recounted by hand, there is no chance that a large number of ballots were double counted."" University of West Georgia political scientist Thomas Hunter said none of the information provided by Voter GA proves that votes in the official certified results were counted twice.  The official certified results were taken from the second recount, which was requested by the Trump campaign, he said. Even if some ballots were counted twice during the risk-limiting audit, he said, ""those numbers are not included in the official results. The official results are from the last recount, which was done by scanning all of the ballots. The results in the official count from Fulton County match quite closely to what the initial count showed."" Hunter added: ""Any large-scale mistakes would have been found through the two recounts."" The Georgia Secretary of State’s office referred questions to Fulton County. A Fulton County spokeswoman declined comment, citing the lawsuit. A tweet says that in the 2020 presidential election, ""4,255 ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, were scanned multiple times"" and ""3,390 went to Biden."" Some 200 ballots initially were double-counted in Fulton County, where heavily Democratic Atlanta is located — but there’s no evidence of thousands, and the double-count didn’t change the official result of Biden defeating Trump in Georgia.

Biden misspoke about turnout numbers, but he didn’t concede 6 million votes

In 2019, long before COVID-19 was even a word, the company announced its plan to supply 18,000 beds for the Olympics and 8,000 beds for the Paralympics.  The beds are meant to be moveable and recyclable. The bed frames are made out of high-resistance cardboard and a customizable mattress. The beds’ lightness helps athletes rearrange their rooms easier. And once the games are over, the beds and mattresses will be recycled into other paper and plastic products.  Even though the beds look breakable, they can withstand a lot of physical activity.

Bernie Sanders says only he supports carbon tax and 'aggressive' approach to climate change
","Bernie Sanders still doesn’t want to talk about Hillary Clinton’s damn emails. Asked for his reaction to the State Department report of Clinton’s use of a private email server, Sanders told Meet the Press’ Chuck Todd that he’d rather talk policy differences. ""Our campaign is about defeating Secretary Clinton on the real issues,"" he responded. ""I want to break up the Wall Street banks. She doesn’t. I want to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. She wants $12 an hour. I voted against the war in Iraq. She voted for the war in Iraq. I believe we should ban fracking. She does not. I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change. That is not her position. Those are some of the issues that I am campaigning on."" Sanders is right about Clinton’s Iraq war vote and where she stands on breaking up banks, a $15 minimum wage and fracking. (For more of their policy differences, read this.) But is he also right about their differences on carbon tax and climate change? There’s no doubt that Sanders’ rhetoric on climate change and his plan to deal with it are aggressive and, unlike Clinton, he has advocated for a carbon tax. Clinton does, however, have a climate change plan. While some environmentalists have said it isn’t tough enough, others have given it positive reviews. Both the Sanders and Clinton campaigns referred us to each candidate’s climate change plan. Sanders’ plan is long and comprehensive. Beyond a tax on carbon, it includes an array of proposals from banning certain drilling and mining practices to improving the national public transit system.   Clinton’s plan is shorter and, though it doesn’t include a tax on carbon, contains similar provisions on renewables. Here’s an overview: Sanders’ plan Clinton’s plan Fossil fuel influence • Cut tax subsidies for oil and gas companies • Prohibit fossil fuel lobbyists from working in the White House • Investigate climate change deniers • Cut tax subsidies for oil and gas companies Environmental standards • Enact a tax on carbon • Ban fossil fuel leasing on public lands and promote conservation and habitat preservation • Ban Arctic oil drilling, offshore drilling, fracking, mountaintop removal coal mining and pipeline projects • Stop exports of natural gas and crude oil • Defend and close loopholes in the Clean Air Act • Increase fuel efficiency standards • Begin a moratorium on nuclear power • Create a national environmental and climate justice plan • Reform fossil fuel leasing and expand clean energy production on public lands • Defend and extend environmental standards like the Clean Power Plan • Eliminate lead poisoning, clean up brownfield sites, and create an Environmental Justice Task Force Renewables • Invest in clean energy infrastructure and modernize the energy grid • Invest in clean energy, alternative fuels and energy efficiency programs • Invest in clean energy infrastructure • Launch a $60 billion local-state-federal clean energy partnership As in her plan, Clinton prefers to focus on renewables on the stump. In a January Medium post responding to the Sanders camp, Clinton’s campaign manager highlighted her pledge to ""make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century"" in her launch speech. Clinton, who played a role in negotiating the Paris climate change agreement, herself touted her goals for more solar panel and clean electricity as ""big"" and ""bold."" Clinton has gotten her best reviews from the League of Conservation Voters, who endorsed Clinton last fall (to some controversy). The green group considers Clinton’s plan strong and aggressive and, more importantly, achievable, Tiernan Sittenfeld, its senior vice president of government affairs, told PolitiFact. ""Hillary is focused on practical solutions,"" Sittenfeld said, pointing out that there are many lawmakers in Congress who still deny climate change science. ""So (a carbon tax) is pretty remote possibility."" But some are skeptical of Clinton’s ""boldness."" Pulitzer Prize-winning website InsideClimate News called Clinton’s plan ambitious but said it ""falls short of bold."" The Washington Post’s editorial board said her ideas are ""second best."" Environmental news magazine Grist summed up her positions as not bad but ""not quite the climate hawkishness we need.""   Our ruling Sanders said, ""I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change. That is not her position."" Unlike Sanders, Clinton doesn’t advocate for a carbon tax. And while Clinton doesn’t go as far as Sanders in her climate change plan, she does have one.

Bernie Sanders says he polls better against Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton does
","Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is behind in the delegate count by near-insurmountable numbers, but he makes the case that he’s a better nominee for November because he polls better than Hillary Clinton in head-to-head matchups against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Sanders made the point again during the May 29, 2016, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press. ""Right now,"" Sanders said, ""in every major poll, national poll and statewide poll done in the last month, six weeks, we are defeating Trump often by big numbers, and always at a larger margin than Secretary Clinton is."" We checked a similar assertion by Sanders in March and found it to be Mostly True. But there have been new polls since then, so we decided to take a new look. As we did previously, we looked at polls taken during the last six weeks that are listed on RealClearPolitics.com and that tested Trump’s support against both Clinton and Sanders. (An additional five polls tested only Clinton against Trump, but we won’t count those.) Here’s a summary: Poll Date Clinton vs. Trump Sanders vs. Trump Sanders advantage over Clinton NBC News-Wall Street Journal 5/15-5/19 Clinton +3 Sanders +15 Sanders by 12 CBS News-New York Times 5/13-5/17 Clinton +6 Sanders +13 Sanders by 7 Fox News 5/14-5/17 Trump +3 Sanders +4 Sanders by 7 Public Policy Polling (D) 5/6-5/9 Clinton +6 Sanders +11 Sanders by 5 CNN/ORC 4/28-5/1 Clinton +13 Sanders +16 Sanders by 3 IBD-TIPP 4/22-4/26 Clinton +7 Sanders +12 Sanders by 5 USA Today-Suffolk 4/20-4/24 Clinton +11 Sanders +15 Sanders by 4 GWU-Battleground 4/17-4/20 Clinton +3 Sanders +10 Sanders by 7 So Sanders is correct that he fares better against Trump than Clinton does in every poll over the past six weeks -- more than 6 points better than Clinton, on average. And Sanders is beating Trump by an average of 12 points in these eight polls, so ""big numbers"" seems like a reasonable description for Sanders to use. Case closed? Not quite, say polling experts. Clinton has been scrutinized and attacked as a public figure for a quarter century, but Sanders -- even after running for president for a year -- is a relatively new figure to voters nationally. So while a lot of voters’ minds are already made up about Clinton based on her long history in the public eye, it remains to be seen how open potential voters will be to supporting Sanders once Republicans start airing negative attacks, especially ones that note his identification as a democratic socialist. (We have previously reported that, according to polls, being a socialist is a less attractive quality for voters than being an atheist.) Kerwin Swint, a political scientist at Kennesaw State University, told PolitiFact Georgia that Sanders shows up so strongly in head-to-head polls because Trump and Clinton have such high negatives. ""General election polls don’t mean much until the conventions are over and you get to late summer or early fall,"" Swint said. ""A lot of voters don’t look at Sanders as a legitimate threat. It’s almost like he’s an imaginary candidate."" In addition, early polls do not weed out ""likely voters,"" as polls later in the campaign do, Steven S. Smith, a Washington University political scientist and a specialist in public opinion, told PolitiFact when we previously checked a similar statement by Sanders. This could matter, given Sanders’ high rates of support among college students and younger voters, who have not yet demonstrated a long track record of voting. ""If Sanders draws disproportionately from people who are not likely to vote, which is a reasonable speculation at this point, then his support may be somewhat overstated in some comparisons,"" Smith said. And it’s worth adding that, as Meet the Press host Chuck Todd noted, Clinton can be expected to poll better against Trump after she officially secures the nomination and many former Sanders supporters come to her side. Our ruling Sanders said, ""Right now, in every major poll, national poll and statewide poll done in the last month, six weeks, we are defeating Trump often by big numbers, and always at a larger margin than Secretary Clinton is."" On the numbers, Sanders is correct: In the past six weeks’ worth of polls, Sanders fares 6 points better against Trump than Clinton does, and he beats Trump by double digits on average. Still, polling experts caution that polls this far away from Election Day are not entirely reliable, and they add that Sanders hasn’t been exposed to the same degree of negative attacks as Clinton has.

This interview wasn’t the first time McCrory has made a statement like that, so we figured we ought to look into it. Political nonprofits known as 501(c)(4) groups, like the HRC, are not required to disclose their donors. But the HRC does so voluntarily, at least for its large corporate donors. That’s the first crack in McCrory’s argument. The Human Rights Campaign files public Form 990 tax records each year, said spokesman Brandon Lorenz. That’s good; doing otherwise would be unlawful. ""Additionally, we voluntarily and proudly annually publish a list of our major donors in Equality Magazine, our quarterly magazine that both lives online and is mailed to approximately 350,000 homes,"" Lorenz said. That is also true. The magazine lists dozens of major sponsors, although it doesn’t say how much they gave to reach the various levels of sponsorship, which are bronze, silver, gold and platinum. We reached out to McCrory’s campaign with this information and asked if there was anything we were missing or misunderstanding about his claim, but we never heard back. In total, the Spring 2016 issue of Equality Magazine lists 47 ""corporate partners"" and 32 ""foundation partners."" Some show up in both lists, like Microsoft and Nike, while others only show up in one. The corporate donors contributed toward the group’s total revenues, which tax records show was $37.4 million for the year between April 2014 and March 2015 – actually a bit higher than what McCrory said in the interview. The list of partners reveals a menagerie of supporters: Banking, pharmaceutical, energy and tech giants alongside companies like vodka distiller Ketel One and defense contractor Northrop Grumman. For the full list of corporate sponsors, see page 31 of the print magazine’s Spring 2016 edition or page 32-33 in the online magazine. Identifying PAC donors But much of the money donated to the nonprofit as a whole can go to more mundane expenses like salaries, rent, travel and educational initiatives. What about the explicitly political giving? In 2016 so far, the group’s PAC and super PAC – which are used to give directly to candidates or purchase ads – have raised a combined $1.37 million. And for that money, we know not only the names of every major donor but also how much they gave, where they live and what they do. It’s all listed in publicly available Federal Election Commission reports, which are helpfully aggregated by the Center for Responsive Politics at www.opensecrets.org. Of the 10 largest individual donations to the group’s PAC, called Human Rights Campaign 2016, three were from North Carolina residents. The names, occupations, hometowns, dates and giving amounts of anyone who donated more than $200 are listed. So far, there have been 396 such donations – but 70 percent of the PAC’s $1,052,936 was donated in increments of less than $200, from donors who are not required to be identified, and whom the HRC does not identify voluntarily. As for the super PAC, called Human Rights Campaign Equality Votes 2016, the group lists 265 donations of more than $200 this election cycle. Unlike the PAC, these large donations accounted for the majority of the $316,154 donated to the super PAC. One notable donation was the $1,000 from Robert Williams, co-owner of the North Carolina design company Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams, which is itself a platinum-level corporate sponsor of the HRC. There was also $2,500 from Joni Madison, who recently left the Durham ad agency McKinney to become the HRC’s chief operations officer. Combined, all these publicly listed donations from North Carolina and elsewhere add up to more than $500,000 out of the total $1.37 million raised by the PAC and Super PAC. Our ruling McCrory is clearly wrong that ""We don't know who funds them."" In the case of the group’s overall budget, we know the name of 47 corporations who are major contributors, ranging from Nationwide Insurance to Starbucks. We don’t know much they gave, but we can at least see how they stack up in a tiered sponsorship system. In the case of the purely political donations, we don’t know the identity of the majority of the donors, who gave in small amounts. But an easy search of public data shows hundreds of people, from business owners and activists to farmers and dentists, who gave more than $200 to the group’s PAC and Super PAC, along with how much they gave. The Human Rights Campaign is not fully transparent, but it’s more transparent than other so-called dark money groups. We rate this claim Mostly False.

"['New Hampshire', 'Public Service', 'Kelly  Ayotte']","
How many days was Maggie Hassan out of New Hampshire in a three month span?
","There’s been a common question from Republicans in New Hampshire’s biggest political race lately. ""Where’s Maggie Hassan?"" Hassan, the Democratic governor, in case anyone missed it, is running for U.S. Senate against incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte. Ayotte’s campaign, like the state’s Republican party, is keen on cataloguing Hassan’s time away from the state as she attends party meetings and fundraisers. In a press release this month titled ""Hassan Claims Her Job is 'Always' Her Top Priority, But She’s Increasingly Absent,"" the Ayotte camp made its case crystal clear. ""If Governor Hassan’s first priority is ‘always’ her job as governor, she wouldn’t have been out of state on 30 days over the last three months,"" spokeswoman Liz Johnson said in the release. Could Hassan have possibly spent an entire month outside of the state from February through April? We decided to check it out. What to check First off, we should note that Ayotte’s campaign originally focused on Hassan’s travel in April alone, based on reporting by the New Hampshire Union Leader. That paper’s reporter Dan Tuohy wrote about the governor’s schedule that month, which included 12 days ""out of New Hampshire"" for political travel. Ayotte’s office cited an earlier version of that article in a May 3 press release, claiming that Hassan spent half of April outside of New Hampshire. But based on Hassan’s schedule, at a maximum she was out of the state 40 percent of the time, which isn’t ""half."" The senator’s campaign soon broadened its criticism to three months, so that’s what we’re focusing on here. Hassan’s campaign regularly discloses the number of days that the governor travels out of state for political purposes. On March 1, it sent a letter to the state Republican party detailing her 10 days of out-of-state political travel from February. On April 1, it sent a letter outlining her eight days of out-of-state political travel that month. And on May 2, it sent a letter noting that Hassan had been outside the state for political reasons 12 days in April. Add up the days, and you have 30 days of travel over three months. Case closed, right? Ayotte’s re-election effort wants to paint the governor as an absentee leader, routinely leaving a state in need of leadership, including a day in May when two police officers were shot . A WMUR report this month lays out their case. The state GOP’s Twitter account routinely presses the charge, too. We checked with both campaigns to see what was behind those numbers. Day-by-day The Hassan campaign’s letters to the state GOP detail her travels. With four exceptions (Philadelphia on Feb. 2, Chicago on Feb. 29, Austin on April 21 and Rhode Island on April 29) she visited three general areas -- New York City; Washington, D.C.; and Massachusetts. It’s easy to see why those three would be crucial for this candidate / governor -- and on five of the days in question Hassan attended the National Governors Association Winter Meeting in D.C. What’s important to note about these travel days is that about half -- 16 of the 30 -- came during days that Hassan had no events scheduled in New Hampshire. For the 14 other days of travel, Hassan spent at least some of her time here. That’s according to her public schedules for the three months, which were made available to PolitiFact New Hampshire by her campaign. The governor’s schedule during these 14 days varied. On April 6, she had a breakfast event at 8 a.m. followed by an Executive Council meeting at 10 a.m. in New Hampshire. She headed to Massachusetts later. Likewise, on April 14, a day of travel in Massachusetts included events in Concord, N.H. (1 p.m.), Londonderry (2 p.m.) and Manchester (4 p.m.). On other travel days, however, the governor only fit in a morning event before hitting the road. That was the case on Feb. 28 and March 2, among others. Doing the math This extra information allows us to crunch Hassan’s travel numbers in different ways. In the simplest terms, Hassan was traveling out of New Hampshire 33 percent of the time from February through April. Her five days at the national governors meeting could be excluded if all she did during that span was attend the conference. (The nonpartisan group includes the heads of all 50 states and discusses policy). However, she also attended separate gatherings with fellow Democratic governors, which is why her campaign included the trip as political travel. Deducting those days gives you a 28 percent absentee rate. Counting only the days that the governor traveled out of state and had no public events in New Hampshire, she was gone 18 percent percent of the time. Geographically, 19 of the 30 trip days were outside of New England -- meaning that Hassan was outside the region only 21 percent of the time. Simple enough, perhaps. But we haven’t exhausted ways of crunching these numbers. Why don’t we simply look at a calendar? While no one would dispute that a governor’s job never stops, most of New Hampshire’s legislative business is conducted during ordinary business hours, during an ordinary business week. So if you take weekend days out of the equation, we have a slightly different picture. Looking only at the 65 total weekdays from February through April, Hassan traveled outside the state on 23 of them.That means she was at least partially on the road for 35 percent of ordinary weekdays for these three months. That’s more than a third of the time. Our ruling U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte’s campaign said earlier this month that Gov. Maggie Hassan was ""out of state on 30 days over the last three months."" Hassan was traveling out of state for political reasons on 30 days of the 90 in February, March and April, but spent a portion of those days in the state as well. If you exclude the days that she also had events in the state, she was absent only 18 percent of the time. There are a multitude of ways to interpret this data about Hassan, and Ayotte’s campaign is certainly taking the least charitable view possible. But it’s also a justifiable one, albeit needing clarification. We rate Ayotte’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/may/27/kelly-ayotte/how-much-has-maggie-hassan-been-out-new-hampshire-/

Donald Trump says Clinton Foundation pays top women less than top men
","Donald Trump is calling Hillary Clinton a hypocrite when it come to gender pay equality, charging that her husband’s Clinton Foundation doesn’t walk the walk when it comes to paying women and men equally. Trump recently shared a post on his Instagram account that sought to highlight pay disparities at the Clinton Foundation. The foundation was founded by her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton has worked for the foundation in periods when she wasn’t serving in government or running for president. ""Hypocrisy at the Clinton Foundation: Top male staff made on average $218,029 while top female staff made $153,014 from 2010-2014,"" Trump posted on May 24, 2016, to his 1.6 million followers. Clinton has been the target of these types of charges before in her time as a U.S. senator. Sean Hannity’s claim that Clinton ""actually paid female staffers a lot less than men"" rated Mostly False. We wondered if this attack was more accurate. A general warning about these types of claims Democrats and Republicans often spin the facts about the gender pay gap, and small changes in how you phrase a claim can make a big difference. For years, we have fact-checked claims by Democratic politicians decrying the gender wage gap, which has been in the neighborhood of 77 cents on the dollar, with slight ups and downs over the years. When politicians simply state the existence of this wage gap, we generally rate those claims Mostly True. What keeps it from a full True is that this gap does not stem entirely from discrimination. The statistic in question doesn’t say that women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man does in the same job. Indeed, that’s a claim we have consistently rated as Mostly False. Rather, the 77 cent figure refers to the overall difference between what men make and what women make. That difference can be shaped not just by discrimination but also by voluntary choices, such as the specific careers men and women pursue and whether they decide to take time off to raise children. Once you genuinely compare men and women in an apples-to-apples comparison -- that is, in an equivalent job, with similar experience, tenure and achievements -- the wage gap doesn’t disappear, but it does shrink significantly. Academics differ on exactly how much, but the 77 cent figure is a much more powerful data point, so it’s the one Democrats and their allies have traditionally turned to. We suggest you read our PolitiFact Sheet to learn more. The number behind Trump’s claim Trump’s claim includes spin we’ve seen before. He’s looking at only a small number of foundation employees while ignoring the central point of the equal pay argument -- which is whether the employees are doing the same work and being compensated differently because of their gender. Though the Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry, we’re fairly certain his data comes from the Clinton Foundation’s IRS form 990 -- the tax form that nonprofit groups are required to file annually. The forms -- which are available for public inspection on the foundation’s website -- require the organization to list the compensation for its highest-paid officials. For the Clinton Foundation, that has typically been in the range of eight to 12 officials per year. We couldn’t reverse-engineer the specific figures cited in Trump’s post -- there are various ways to calculate the compensation figures listed -- but the numbers we did come up are in line with the ones Trump cited. Trump’s calculation has female top officials at the foundation earning, on average, 70 cents for every dollar that the average male top official at the foundation earned. If you look at the total compensation reported, which includes fringe benefits, our calculations showed that women earned 67 cents for every dollar earned by a man. If you look instead at the salary column only, the figure was 66 cents on the dollar. If you remove the compensation for the officials identified as CEOs during that period, the ratio improves, but still climbs only to 77 cents. And if you use the median amount rather than the average -- which statisticians usually prefer because it gives less emphasis to extreme data points -- the figure still improves to only 76 cents on the dollar. Any way you look a it, among those eight to 12 high-ranking foundation employees, the men consistently earned more than women. (For what it’s worth, an analysis of the Trump campaign’s financial-disclosure forms reported in the Huffington Post and Slate.com found the same trend applied to Trump.) Why these figures don’t prove gender discrimination The salaries of eight to 12 executives do not prove the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton are hypocrites when it comes to equal pay. The number of salaries included in Trump’s comparison accounts for just a fraction of all employees in the organization -- and even of senior management at the foundation. The foundation told PolitiFact that there are ""several hundred"" employees in the United States alone. Experts say this is too small a sample to say much about the foundation’s overall compensation practices. ""I’m not sure I would draw too much from such a small number of employees,"" said Linda Babcock, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University's H. John Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management. In addition, the types of jobs disclosed in the tax form run the gamut from CEO to information technology director to senior fellow to human resources director. Few organizations would pay the CEO the same as an IT director, so finding differences doesn’t necessarily mean much without a much deeper analysis of the employer’s hiring practices. ""The Clinton Foundation could argue it has paid equitable wages to both men and women, notwithstanding the fact that its high-paid men earned higher salaries than its high-paid women,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. In fact, experts say that evidence of gender pay discrimination is most discernible at the lower end of the pay scale. Top-level positions are usually filled by people who have specific credentials and career experiences. Because these factors are in high demand in the broader employment marketplace and often hard to find in a single candidate, the compensation level tends to be tailored to the specific candidate, whether a man or a woman. ""Compensation is influenced by one's alternative pay options,"" said Hannah Riley Bowles, a senior lecturer in public policy at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. ""Dramatic differences could be explained by one's market value in the private sector, which is likely to vary substantially looking at senior professionals with public-interest careers."" In a statement, the foundation told PolitiFact that at the end of 2014, the senior leadership listed publicly on their website included nine women and nine men, and those women earned 91 cents for every dollar a man earned. The foundation also said that at the end of 2014, 64 percent of its U.S.-based employees were women. ""Pay equity is an important and difficult issue that many large organizations grapple with, and we take it seriously at the Foundation,"" the foundation said. Our ruling Trump’s post said, ""Hypocrisy at the Clinton Foundation: Top male staff made on average $218,029 while top female staff made $153,014 from 2010-2014."" If you allow some leeway on what accounts for top staff, Trump is close on the numbers. But the statistical pool is too limited and the methodology is too crude to demonstrate evidence of hypocrisy. Trump is guilty of ignoring the nuances of gender-based wage disparities, just as Democrats often over-simplify the meaning of the 77-cent figure. The statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ba673130-73fe-4886-9d2d-d3a5f79b4428",/factchecks/2016/may/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-clinton-foundation-pays-top-wome/

Ad attacking former AG gets details right, but misses big picture
","A television ad criticizes Nevada Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto for using her position as the state’s attorney general to benefit her ""special-interest allies."" Freedom Partners Action Fund, which is backed by the Koch Brothers, is spending $1 million on ads attacking Cortez Masto over a deal she made with Washington, D.C., law firm Cohen Milstein to represent the state in 2009. ""Lost homes, lost jobs, lost hope — the housing crisis hit Nevada hardest. But during the crisis, Catherine Cortez Masto gave a sweetheart contract worth millions to a D.C. law firm, that then donated thousands to her political campaigns,"" the ad says. The ad itself is mostly accurate in describing an arrangement with an out-of-state law firm taking in millions of dollars it won in fighting court cases on behalf of Nevada, while the state’s attorney general received around $2,600 in campaign donations from several of the firm’s lawyers. But there are a few layers of context that need to be unpacked. Contingency fees Cortez Masto has focused her 2016 Senate campaign on her response to the foreclosure crisis. She touts her involvement with large settlements totalling around $1.9 billion for Nevada homeowners suffering after the 2008 economic recession. She wasn’t working alone. While she was attorney general, she arranged an agreement with a powerful Washington, D.C., law firm, Cohen Milstein, in 2009 to assist on deceptive lending practice litigation. The ad takes issue with the contract’s structure — Cohen Milstein would be paid with a contingent fee, only awarded if a settlement they helped litigate was reached. Many states, including Nevada, take advantage of these contracts because they don’t require up-front costs and allow overworked or understaffed state attorneys to bring in ‘hired guns"" to take on well-financed private corporate lawyers. Nevada law prohibits employing any outside attorney unless the Attorney General’s office is ""disqualified"" to represent state interests, but Cortez Masto has argued that the state’s relatively small Attorney General’s office and massive statewide budget cuts necessitated use of outside counsel to help with high-profile litigation against, say, large financial institutions. But use of contingent-fee contracts have recently come under fire, with critics saying the arrangements pervert the priorities for state attorneys general by focusing on cases with a potentially larger payoff than those that serve the public. ""This has gotten out of hand,"" former Massachusetts attorney general Scott Harshbarger told the New York Times in 2014. ""And it seriously threatens the perception of integrity and professionalism of the office, as it raises the question of whether attorneys are taking up these cases because they are important public matters, or they are being driven more by potential for private financial gain."" Masto did indeed take campaign contributions from six lawyers at Cohen Milstein during her re-election campaign in 2010, nearly a year after the Cohen Milstein contract was approved. The six donated a total of $2,650 to the Democrat, with all coming after the general election. Those donations represented a drop in the bucket for Masto, who raised close to $460,000 through that election cycle. Her opponent, Republican lawyer Travis Barrick, only reported raising $15,000 and lost in a landslide. Do those donations really make Coretz Masto’s arrangement with Cohen Milstein a ""sweetheart deal?"" Who benefits? The Cohen Milstein contract was certainly beneficial for both the firm and state coffers. But the deal itself was more modest than similar arrangements in other states. The firm helped arrange a separate settlement with Bank of America that netted the state an extra $38 million. Cohen Milstein got $5.6 million in fees. Lawyers from Cohen Milstein didn’t return calls to PolitiFact, but records from the state Controller’s Office show six payments to the law firm totalling around $12.7 million between 2009 and 2014. The Cortez Masto campaign said the firm was hired through a competitive bidding process. The contract itself was approved with no controversy or discussion by the state’s Board of Examiners, which includes Republican Gov. Jim Gibbons. The contract was also designed without a cap on the amount of litigated fees that could be collected, which was criticized by lawmakers who successfully strengthened state law and added more oversight over contracts with outside counsel in 2015. Republican Sen. Greg Brower, who sponsored the bill, said during a legislative meeting that Cortez Masto’s office likely violated state law through continual overuse of contingent-fee contracts. ""There is a feeling on the part of many observers that the Office of the Attorney General has been essentially abdicating its oversight and discretion over when and how to settle cases to the private law firms it has hired,"" he said. Cortez Masto did not start the practice of using outside lawyers. Nevada has historically sought outside counsel on big cases, such as the settlement with big tobacco companies in the late 1990s. Before 2015, the Attorney General’s office arranged the contracts with little outside oversight, but the state generally offered less lucrative rates for outside lawyers than other states. Suits and countersuits The legality of the arrangement with Cohen Milstein has been questioned several times. With the assistance of Cohen Milstein, Nevada sued Florida-based Lender Processing Services in 2009 over questionable practices around mortgage loan documents. LPS counter-sued, claiming that the contract between the state and Cohen Milstein violated state law surrounding hiring of outside counsel. The case went far enough that possible sanctions against Cortez Masto’s office were brought up by a district-level judge and oral arguments were held at the state Supreme Court. The two parties settled for $5.5 million before the state Supreme Court issued a ruling. Major homebuilders Pulte Homes Inc. and Lennar Corp. also filed a lawsuit against the state in 2010 after Cohen Milstein was ""deputized"" to go after the companies, saying the firm couldn’t represent a separate labor union and the state. The case was later settled with the state receiving $475,000 and Pulte not admitting to any wrongdoing. Even with the new rules, Nevada continues to employ outside counsel for certain high-profile legal challenges. Current Attorney General Adam Laxalt hired another well-known law firm based out of Washington, D.C. — Bancroft PLLC — to represent the state in a lawsuit against the state’s new quasi-voucher program. Our ruling A Freedom Partners Action Fund ad claims Cortez Masto ""gave a sweetheart contract worth millions to a D.C. law firm that then donated thousands to her political campaigns."" The general contours of the ad are accurate. As attorney general, Cortez Masto entered into a contingency-fee contract with Cohen Milstein for outside counsel on lawsuits filed against companies involved in the foreclosure crisis. She then received campaign contributions amounting to $2,650 from at least six lawyers at the firm — technically this is ""thousands,"" but the ad's vague language overplays the scale of those donations compared to her total haul. We take issue with the ad's ""sweetheart"" description of the deal, as the firm was chosen through a bidding process that was reviewed and approved externally. Lost in the ad is how the extra help was sought amid budget cuts at the Attorney General's office, and Nevada benefited from the lawsuits.  Because some additional context is needed, we rate the statement Half True.",/factchecks/2016/may/27/freedom-partners-action-fund/ad-attacking-former-ag-gets-details-right-misses-b/

Wendy Davis wrongly says Texas among states with no 'equal pay' law
","She lost the Texas governor’s race in 2014, where she called for stepped-up attention to women’s health care access and equal pay. But Democrat Wendy Davis still talks up women’s issues including, in a March 2016 interview by Texas Monthly, her desire to revisit legislation nixed by the Republican governor when she was a state senator from Fort Worth. Asked what issues she’s thinking about ""besides reproductive autonomy,"" Davis replied: ""Of course, equal pay. You may recall that I, along with the amazing Senfronia Thompson in the Texas House, was successful in passing an equal pay bill here, which was no easy feat—only to have it vetoed by Gov. Perry. So Texas is one of only a handful of states that does not have an equal pay law. Even the law that exists at the federal level needs some punch."" We wondered about the Texas part of her statement. Does the state rank among a few states lacking a law that ensures equal pay for male and female employees holding comparable jobs? Texas actually has laws that apply, we found, though no law has a time window like the one in federal law for an employee to challenge a pay action. To our inquiry, a Davis spokesman, Hector Nieto, described that gap--closed by laws in 42 states--as substantially weakening a Texas employee’s ability to sue. As a senator, to recap, Davis championed a measure giving a worker affected by an unequal pay action 180 days to file a dispute from when the inequity is discovered. The sought change, in keeping with the federal Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, would have widened a state law that gives workers 180 days from the occurrence of an ""unlawful employment practice"" to file a complaint. House Bill 950 by Rep. Thompson, D-Houston, won House and Senate approval in 2013, a year after the Texas Supreme Court held that absent legislative action, the Ledbetter provision revising the statute of limitations didn’t apply to cases brought under the Texas anti-discrimination laws. Next, as Davis said, Gov. Rick Perry vetoed the proposal, as he was urged to do by business interests including Macy’s. In his veto proclamation, Perry said the measure  duplicated federal law, ""which already allows employees who feel they have been discriminated against through compensation to file a claim with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission."" Thompson offered a similar proposal during the 2015 legislative session. It was defeated in the House. Davis spokesman notes NCSL research We recognized that Texas has statutory restrictions on pay discrimination after asking Davis about the basis of her declaration that Texas ranks among states that don’t have an ""equal pay"" law. By email, Nieto directed us to a July 2015 chart summarizing state ""equal pay"" laws posted by the Denver-based National Conference of State Legislatures, which says it strives to improve the ""quality and effectiveness"" of the nation’s state legislatures. The chart’s Texas entry indicates the state has two laws related to equal pay--one protecting state government workers, the other generally ""prohibiting discrimination based on protected class status."" In Texas that includes race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, age and disability. The laws are in the state’s labor code, the chart indicates, which contains: --The Texas Equal Work, Equal Pay law, which took effect in 1993, stating: ""A woman who performs public service for this state is entitled to be paid the same compensation for her service as is paid to a man who performs the same kind, grade, and quantity of service, and a distinction in compensation may not be made because of sex."" --Chapter 21 of the code, ""Employment Discrimination,"" includes a section stating an employer ""commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin or age the employer… fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection with compensation or the terms, conditions or privileges of employment."" We wondered if the general law fairly adds up to Texas already barring pay discrimination. To our request for expert analysis, Amy Starnes of the State Bar of Texas directed us to attorneys including C.B. Burns, an El Paso labor and employment lawyer, who by phone agreed the general law in the labor code offers recourse for workers in Texas who wish to pursue equal-pay disputes. By email, Burns elaborated, though, that the law only applies to employers with 15 employees or more and that private and public employers are covered under it; in contrast, the Texas Equal Pay Act applies to state employees only. Burns summed up: ""We don't have a statute called the Equal Pay Act like there is in federal law, but we have a discrimination statute that prohibits sex discrimination and equal-pay claims are a form of sex discrimination."" Separately, Patrick Maher, a Dallas employment discrimination lawyer, told us it’s a ""misstatement"" to say there’s no Texas law against pay discrimination, explaining that the Ch. 21 law would offer protections and defenses on top of federal laws. Other states And what of other states? According to NCSL’s breakdown, as of July 2015, two states had no ""equal pay"" law: Alabama and Mississippi--a conclusion also reached, as of April 2016, by the Department of Labor. Put another way, the NCSL places Texas among 44 states with a degree of an ""equal pay"" law. Four states only have a general employment discrimination law: North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin, according to the group. A web search led us to another analysis of state equal pay laws; the American Association of University Women lists Alabama, Mississippi and South Carolina as lacking equal pay laws as of 2016. The association, which favors strong state equal pay laws, ranked Texas among 13 states with ""poor"" laws, meaning in part that the laws don’t apply to all workers. Since the group’s ratings were last updated online, Nebraska passed a measure upping the number of employees covered under their law, moving them into the ""moderate"" category, Amy Becker, AAUW’s political media manager told us by email. She also explained that Texas automatically qualified for the ""poor"" rating because its general anti-discrimination law applies only to workplaces with 15 or more employees. AAUW’s breakdown lists 19 measures it would like states to have in their equal pay laws and lists Texas as having one: no discrimination/retaliation for involvement in legal proceedings. States with nine or more equal pay protections are considered to have ""strong"" equal pay laws. Those states, according to AAUW, are California, Illinois, Minnesota, North Dakota, Tennessee and Vermont. Our ruling Davis said: ""Texas is one of only a handful of states that does not have an equal pay law."" Texas might not have the strongest laws against pay discrimination. But two anti-discrimination laws exist, one limited to state employees and the other to people working for larger businesses. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

","What is behind the ""skills gap"" that business and civic leaders often say inhibits economic progress in the Milwaukee metropolitan area? Milwaukee Area Technical College President Vicki Martin points to a low percentage of Milwaukee public high school students going on to college as one factor. Martin spoke May 12, 2016 on a WisPolitics panel about narrowing the skills gap, along with Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce President Tim Sheehy. Kleefisch first described the skills gap saying, ""the folks that employers are seeking don’t necessarily represent the skill sets that those job seekers actually have."" Then Martin picked up the mic -- and the theme. ""So contributing to that gap, or the mismatch as you outlined, is the fact that we have a lot of folks not even going into the college environment,"" Martin said. ""We found out in our community, for example, in Milwaukee high schools only 50 percent were going on to two- or four-year institutions."" There are multiple high school options in Milwaukee, when you factor in choice and charter schools. But Martin was focusing on Milwaukee Public Schools, so we will as well. Is it true that half of all those who complete MPS enroll in a two- or four-year college program? We decided to check it out. The numbers When we asked Martin for backup on the claim, her team sent us to the Department of Public Instruction’s WISEdash database. The database matches information on those who complete high school with college-level enrollment figures from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, a nonprofit group that tracks students and provides data to local governments and other entities. The center collects enrollment data from more than 3,300 institutions across the nation that account for 96 percent of all students in two- and four-year college programs.   The most recent data is for students who completed high school at the end of the 2013-’14 academic year. In fall of that year, some 37.7 percent of MPS completers -- a category that includes, for instance, those who get a G.E.D. -- enrolled in a two- or four-year program. Another 12.6 percent enrolled at a later date. That puts enrollment in college at just above 50 percent for the group. In comparison, 66.3 percent of high school completers statewide enrolled in a two- or four-year program. Over time, of course, students from each group continue to begin college programs, so the percentage keeps growing. For instance, for students who completed MPS in 2012, the percentage is now 59.6 percent. To be sure, the data has its limits. The National Clearinghouse Research Center only tracks students after completing high school -- so those who don’t finish high school aren’t included. In MPS, about 60 percent of all students complete high school in four years and 70 percent finish in six. That means fewer than half of all students who attended MPS wind up enrolling in an institution of higher learning. Here’s a rough calculation to account for students who did not complete high school. For the 2014 cohort, 60.9 percent finished high school on time from MPS. Of those, just about half have enrolled in additional education. So, of all students in that group, about 30 percent have gone on to higher learning. So, from that perspective, Martin’s statement actually overstates the number. In other words, the challenge of closing the skills gap is even bigger than she presented. Our rating Martin said only 50 percent of students from Milwaukee public high schools ""go on to a two- or four-year college."" Data backs her claim, though the method used dramatically understates how few students actually pursue higher education given the low graduation rate in MPS. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate Martin’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/may/27/vicki-martin/it-true-only-half-milwaukee-public-schools-student/
"['Polls and Public Opinion', 'Texas', 'Ted Cruz']","
Ted Cruz incorrectly says Donald Trump has 'second-highest disapproval' of any presidential hopeful
","A dozen days before suspending his presidential candidacy, Sen. Ted Cruz charged Donald Trump with being the second-most disliked candidate for president, implying that only Hillary Clinton was worse off. The Texan's claim emerged in an online ad, ""War Room,"" which was posted as Cruz scrambled unsuccessfully to best Trump in Kentucky’s April 2016 Republican presidential primary. The shadowy video purports to show the actress portraying Clinton huddling with nervous advisers who say first that Trump has considerable weaknesses. ""He has the second-highest disapproval ratings of anyone running for president,"" an adviser says. Next, another pretend aide asks who has the highest (or worst) disapproval rating--and all eyes fall away. Of late, Trump and Clinton appear to be poised for a November showdown in the general election, representing the Republican and Democratic parties, respectively. It’s also so that fresh polls including an ABC News/Washington Post poll taken in mid-May 2016 suggest each hopeful has high unfavorability ratings--giving the two unwelcome common ground. Regardless, we checked Cruz’s poll claim in part because whenever candidates tout polls, there’s a risk of obfuscation and oversimplification. For instance, this April we rated False Trump’s claim that his favorability numbers were higher than Ronald Reagan’s at the same time in 1980. Also in April, we rated Mostly False Cruz’s claim that ""poll after poll"" showed him beating Clinton one-on-one. So for recent history’s sake, we decided to see if Cruz was right pre-departure about Trump having the second-highest disapproval ratings among all presidential hopefuls. Cruz’s data In response to our query, Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier emailed data from a national poll released Feb. 18, 2016, by respected pollster Quinnipiac University, naming Clinton and Trump the least-favored candidates, respectively. The questionnaire asked 1,342 registered voters intended to represent the national electorate between February 10 and 15, 2016, whether their opinions of 11 candidates and politicians were favorable, unfavorable,or if they lacked the information to judge. Fifty-eight percent registered as ""unfavorable"" to Clinton, 57 percent said as much for Trump. Then again, the poll’s 2.7 percentage point margin of error means that Clinton’s lead on Trump for unfavorability was too close to call. We looked into other voter polls, finding -- in contrast to Cruz’s claim -- Trump uniformly viewed as the least liked candidate, counting Clinton and others still vying at the time of the respective polls. But first we heard back from Tim Malloy, assistant director of Quinnipiac Polls, who said in a phone interview that it’s ""apples and oranges"" to mix up polls that gauge voter impressions of candidates with those that check on whether they approve or disapprove of someone’s job performance. Favorability, Malloy said, rates people’s overall impression of candidates, including their character and personality.  ""It’s pretty much, ‘Do you like the person?’"" he said. Approval ratings tie to how well people think someone has done a job. For example, Malloy said, at the end of New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s years in that office, Giuliani had low favorability and high approval. People didn’t much like him, Malloy said, yet they thought he did a good job as mayor. Other data Now let’s turn to what other polls showed per the frontrunners’ favorable/unfavorable ratings at the time Cruz was still a candidate. Up to the debut of Cruz’s ad, the political poll aggregator RealClearPolitics had posted 59 polls rating Trump’s favorability, starting from a Quinnipiac poll taken in May 2015, weeks before he announced his candidacy. It had posted more than 200 polls rating Clinton’s favorability, starting from a Rasmussen poll taken in November 2012.    As of May 25, 2016, the website’s aggregation of polls gave Clinton a net 56.3 percent unfavorable rating; Trump had a net 58 percent unfavorable rating. But that didn’t nail down the two candidates’ scores at the time Cruz aired his ad. For our part, we pulled the relevant results from 21 polls rating candidate favorability and listed by RealClearPolitics between the Feb. 18, 2016 publication of the Quinnipiac poll shared by the Cruz campaign and the April 21, 2016, debut of Cruz’s ad, also folding in the poll immediately before the Feb. 18 poll. Some of the 22 polls contacted registered voters while others surveyed likely voters. In each one, Trump had the highest disapproval ratings among candidates of either party; Clinton ran second to Trump in unfavorability in 18 polls.

April 17-20 1,000 Trump - 65 percent Clinton - 56 percent SOURCE: RealClearPolitics The numbers show Trump all but once ranking No. 1 in unfavorable ratings. After Cruz suspended his campaign, we reached out to share this pattern and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Before bowing out for president, Cruz said Trump had the second-highest disapproval ratings of anyone bidding for president. Not quite. A February 2016 poll showed Clinton with slightly worse ratings than Trump, who had the second-worst rating overall. But the unfavorability gap between Clinton and Trump also fell within the poll’s margin of error--and more than 20 other polls taken from February into April 2016 each showed Trump at No. 1 in disapproval.

Newt Gingrich offends history, claims Trump's timeline to becoming GOP nominee is historic
","Donald Trump’s rapid ascension from reality TV star and businessman to presumptive Republican nominee is truly historic, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga, said in a post on Twitter. Shortly after Trump secured enough delegates to officially clinch the GOP nomination, Gingrich extolled Trump in a post on social media. ""No one in American history has moved from a June 16 announcement to a May 26 winning of a majority,"" Gingrich told his 1.55 million followers. ""Trump's achievement is remarkable.""  Many do see Trump’s victory as remarkable. And Gingrich would have been on firmer ground had he stuck to the narrative of Trump's ascension rather than focusing on the timeline. But the speed at which Trump went from his announcement at Trump Tower to becoming the GOP standard bearer isn’t a remarkable achievement. Trump announced his candidacy for president June 16, 2015, in New York, and officially clinched the GOP nomination May 26, 2016, after 29 unbound delegates said they would support Trump. That’s a span of 346 days, if you include May 26. We didn’t have too look too far to find shorter spans for non-incumbents. John Kerry in 2004 John Kerry didn’t announce his run for the White House until Sept. 2, 2003, and he clinched the Democratic nomination May 5, 2004. That’s a speedy 246-day window. George W. Bush in 2000 Republicans, too, have been much quicker. George W. Bush announced his run for the White House June 12, 1999. He clinched the GOP nomination after the primaries of March 15, 2000,  a span of 278 days. Al Gore in 2000 In the same election, Al Gore needed a little less time. Gore announced his run June 16, 1999, while clinching the same day as Bush, March 15, 2000. That’s 274 days. Bob Dole in 1996 Bob Dole, a senator from Kansas, announced his campaign April 10, 1995, and clinched the Republican nomination March 19, 1996. That’s 345 days, one fewer than it took Trump. Bill Clinton in 1992 Bill Clinton announced his campaign for president Oct. 3, 1991. Even though he didn’t clinch the Democratic nomination until June 2, 1992, he still only needed a total of 244 days — more than 100 days quicker than Trump. For the record, Trump took a few weeks less than Mitt Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008, and he easily bested Barack Obama, who needed about 16 months in 2008. A spokesman for Gingrich, Ross Worthington, said Gingrich's point was that no one has won the nomination from a standing-start in such a short period. ""The other nominees you mention did not begin running for president on their announcement day,"" Worthington said. ""Instead, they were clearly running, or at least preparing to run, for months or even years before they made an official announcement. They all had significant preexisting political operations and held significant political offices. The achievement that Newt is referring to is starting from zero to winning the nomination outright."" Our ruling Speaking of Trump’s path to becoming the 2016 GOP standard-bearer, Gingrich said: ""No one In American history has moved from a June 16 announcement to a May 26 winning of a majority."" Whatever Gingrich was trying to say, it didn't come out quite right. As one person replied to the former speaker on Twitter, ""This tweet sounds smart and impressive if someone doesn't have Google."" Of the last eight non-incumbent presidential nominees, five (Kerry, Gore, Bush, Dole and Clinton) went from announcing their candidacy to becoming the presumptive nominee quicker than Trump.

A Mickey Mouse claim: California’s Capitol 'second only to Disneyland' among visitors
"," California is home to some of the most popular tourist attractions anywhere: Disneyland, the San Diego Zoo and Yosemite National Park quickly come to mind. They’ll likely be top destinations for travelers over the Memorial Day holiday. But an old wives’ tale in Sacramento would have you believe the state Capitol building ranks ""second only to Disneyland"" in annual visitors across the Golden State. State Sen. Richard Pan repeated this myth at a recent hearing at the Capitol. ""We have all these visitors coming here, second only to Disneyland, and yet when you look up there’s something missing -- fire sprinklers,"" said Pan, D-Sacramento, on April 7, 2016. ""We have all those people walking through here, but if there’s a fire we’re in big trouble."" Pan’s claim about the number of visitors sounded dubious. We set out to examine whether the Capitol really is ""second only to Disneyland."" We didn’t check whether it was the second ‘happiest place on Earth.’ Sen. Richard Pan says the state Capitol is ""second only to Disneyland"" in visitors in this Sacramento Bee video. Our research The Capitol attracts roughly one million visitors inside the building annually, according to figures provided by the Capitol museum, which is part of the state parks department and runs tours of the building. Of those, about half take tours and visit the museum, while the rest are there on official business, said Tabitha Mwai, a Capitol tour guide employed through the museum. The domed, neo-classical structure houses the state legislature and governor’s office. It was first built in the late 1800s. It buzzes with life on a typical day with lawmakers and lobbyists competing for space with school groups, reporters and sometimes protesters inside its cramped hallways. While Pan sounded like he was referring to visitors inside, we checked on the number outside, too. Nearly 1,000 permitted events from small press conferences to large rallies take place on the Capitol grounds each year, according to Officer Mike Martis, Jr., a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol, which administers the permits. Martis said the agency does not keep data on how many people attend the events. He offered a very rough and unofficial estimate of between 50,000 and 100,000 annually. The Capitol building is home to the California State Legislature, including the Assembly Chamber shown above. File photo / Capital Public Radio Going with this approximation, we’ll say the Capitol draws 1.1 million inside and out. That’s a lot of visitors. But what about attractions other than Disneyland? Yosemite? The San Diego Zoo? The Monterey Bay Aquarium, among others? A comprehensive list ranking attendance at the state’s top attractions is difficult to find. But the attractions we listed all draw far more visitors each year. Disneyland is the apparent top draw at 16 million paid visitors, according to Statista, a statistics company. Yosemite attracts about 4 million people each year, according to the National Park Service, while the San Diego Zoo welcomes 3.2 million annually, according to a zoo spokeswoman. The Monterey Bay Aquarium, meanwhile, reported more than 2 million in total attendance in 2014. The Capitol’s 1.1 million visitors place it ahead of Hearst Castle’s 770,000, but behind Alcatraz Island’s 1.4 million tally.  Lawmaker’s response When we asked where Sen. Pan got his information, his spokeswoman referred us to comments from the same April hearing by California Department of General Services Director Daniel Kim. A video shows Kim stating: ""Other than Disneyland, the state Capitol is the second most visited site in California, with millions of visitors annually."" Brian Ferguson, a spokesman for that department, said Kim relied on ""an old wives’ tale that docents at the Capitol say every time they give a tour."" It’s a tale even Maria Shriver, the state’s former First Lady, repeated in a 2009 magazine article, where she said ""Our Capitol is one of the most visited places in California, second only to Disneyland."" Ferguson said perhaps it was true at one point. Erin Renfree, a state parks Capitol tour guide supervisor who’s led tours there since 1999, said she’s never heard her guides or volunteer docents make that claim. ""I’ve never used that on my tours. I’ve never heard any of the tour guides use that,"" Renfree said. She added the state can’t control what private guides might tell visitors. On Pan’s more serious point about the Capitol, and specifically its attached annex building needing safety upgrades: Gov. Jerry Brown has proposed $1.5 billion in the upcoming budget to renovate or replace that and two other state buildings. Our ruling State Sen. Richard Pan said the state Capitol is ""second only to Disneyland"" in visitors in California. This center of state government draws about a bit more than one million annually. But that’s peanuts compared with Yosemite, the San Diego Zoo or Monterey Bay Aquarium, which attract between two and four times as many per year. A state spokesman said the claim about the Capitol is ""an old wives’ tale."" If it ever was correct, it’s long outdated and now just flat out wrong.

US vs. the Nordic block: How they compare on foreign aid giving
","President Barack Obama recently hosted a meeting with the leaders of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland. The president had nothing but good things to say about his visitors from the Nordic block, remarking that, ""There have been times where I’ve said, ‘Why don’t we just put all these small countries in charge for a while, and they could clean things up.’ "" Small but potent was a recurring theme. ""They are, individually, not large countries in terms of population, but in terms of effectiveness, contributions, ideas, energy, they are enormously important players on the international stage,"" Obama said as they wrapped up their meeting on May 13, 2016. ""The Nordic countries are some of the few countries -- and, by the way, the United States doesn’t fall into this category -- of meeting the goals that had been set with respect to foreign aid and humanitarian assistance."" Obama was specifically thinking about a United Nations benchmark that says that 0.7 percent of a country’s Gross National Income should go to official development assistance. It’s an aspirational target that dates back to 1970 and is entirely voluntary. (Gross National Income is a slightly less common way to measure the size of country’s economy.) The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development keeps track of that spending. The money has to go to developing countries and military aid doesn’t count. Since about 1980, four countries have met or shot well beyond the 0.7 percent mark. They are Sweden, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands. You will notice that Finland and Iceland are missing from that group. Finland has come close, approaching 0.6 percent since 2010, and once -- in 1991 -- hitting 0.8 percent. But that’s not 0.7 percent. Iceland’s high-water mark was .47 in 2008, but its banks bet heavily on risky housing securities and the nation’s economy crashed hard in the Great Recession. Today, it puts .24 percent toward foreign development aid. Here’s how the 29 member countries of the OECD Development Assistance Committee stack up. (The United States is listed in orange; Nordic countries are in blue.)  The United States is in the middle of the pack with 0.17 percent of GNI. That is just one way of measuring aid, however. The American economy is huge, so in terms of raw dollars, its spending stands way above all others. In 2015, the total was nearly $31 billion, or about a fifth of all the development aid tracked by the OECD. Of note: Great Britain and Luxembourg have been doing a good job of hitting the 0.7 percent target. In a purely technical sense and for just a couple of years, so has the United Arab Emirates. In 2014 and 2015, it gave more than 1 percent of its GNI in aid. But virtually all of that went to Egypt to support the military after it toppled the government led by parties aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood. Our ruling Obama said that the Nordic countries are among the few that have met foreign development aid goals. He was referring to the voluntary target of 0.7 percent of Gross National Income that wealthier nations agreed to in 1970. For the largest Nordic nations of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, Obama is correct. All of them have met or exceeded the 0.7 percent mark for many years. But if you put Finland and Iceland into the mix, the statement’s accuracy slips. Finland is close but not quite at the mark, and Iceland lies further from it. We’ll say the statement is three-fifths correct. That rates Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/may/26/barack-obama/us-v-nordic-block-how-they-compare-foreign-aid/
"['State Budget', 'Florida', 'Carlos Lopez-Cantera']","
Carlos Lopez-Cantera says he is only Florida lieutenant governor to forgo security detail
","Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera rolls without a security detail, a fact he likes to bring up as he campaigns to replace U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. It’s an example of penny-pinching that he uses to set himself apart from the field of five Republicans vying for Rubio’s seat, as well as some predecessors who drew scrutiny over transportation spending. ""I've actually cut the budget of the office by more than half, reduced the staff,"" he said in an interview with Fox 13’s Money, Power, Politics show in Tampa which ran on air April 30. ""I'm also the only lieutenant governor to not ever take a security detail."" Lopez-Cantera had dropped this tidbit at a speech earlier that month with the Hillsborough County GOP, explaining, ""It’s a waste of your money, and I’m protected by the Second Amendment."" (He has a concealed weapons permit.) With Lopez-Cantera playing up this factoid as an accomplishment, we wanted to know if he was really the first No. 2 guy to say ""nah, I’ve got this,"" to taxpayer-paid protection. How he declined his security detail According to state law, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles shall assign one patrol officer to the Office of the Governor — it does not mention the lieutenant governor. In practice, the right to a security detail for protection and transportation has been extended to recent lieutenant governors. But after Gov. Rick Scott plucked him for the office in 2014, Lopez-Cantera verbally declined that protection. In March, the Legislature approved a budget that added some language to state that the security patrol is at ""the discretion of the Lieutenant Governor."" It seems that Lopez-Cantera had that discretion anyway, but the new language in law makes that clear. The Legislature also added language to give the right to security for the attorney general, chief financial officer and agriculture commissioner. That appears to stem from a ""credible threat"" on Attorney General Pam Bondi in 2015, which prompted law enforcement to provide around-the-clock security for her for six weeks at a cost of $216,000. Scott’s press office re-emphasized that it was Lopez-Cantera’s choice — and not, as rumor had it, the decision of former Scott chief of staff Adam Hollingsworth to downplay the role — in response to our inquiry. Still, there appeared to be a push to reduce expenses in that position after multiple news reports cited the amount of money spent on security and travel for Jeff Kottkamp under Gov. Charlie Crist and Jennifer Carroll, Scott’s first lieutenant governor. The state spent $1.1 million over four years for security and transportation for Kottkamp. In Carroll's first year in office, the Florida Highway Patrol spent $288,000 on travel and security. But after spending restrictions were put in place, that total dropped to $89,000 in 2012. Lopez-Cantera garners even less attention as lieutenant governor than Carroll, hardly ever appearing alongside Scott at public events and keeping a sparse public calendar of events, the Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times Tallahassee bureau noted in July 2015. Lopez-Cantera had six days of security — at a cost of $27,000 — in May 2014 following a threat against him, according to a Florida Department of Law Enforcement report. Past lieutenant governors and security The lieutenant governor role was revived in 1968 after a century without one. We tried to contact Lopez-Cantera’s predecessors (who are still alive today) for the low-down. The Florida Highway Patrol said that the following lieutenant governors had a security detail: Wayne Mixson (1979-87), Bobby Brantley (1987-1991), Buddy MacKay (1991-1998), Frank Brogan (1999-2003), Toni Jennings (2003-07), Kottkamp (2007-11) and Carroll (2011-13.) We attempted to reach all of those former lieutenant governors and were able to interview all but Brogan, Jennings and MacKay. Four confirmed they used the security detail.  The only one who said he didn’t use a security detail was Jim Williams, who was the lieutenant governor 1975-79. ""I didn’t have security,"" Williams, 93, told PolitiFact Florida. Anita Oneida Darley, his aide at the time, also said he didn’t have a security detail. The Florida Highway Patrol could not confirm. Mixson said that he used a security detail when he traveled within Florida, but he did not when he was in the office or when he traveled to foreign countries. ""The Florida Highway Patrol had traditionally supplied a security individual and they did,"" Mixson said. Brantley said he had a state trooper who traveled with him sometimes, including on a trip to Canada. He said the trooper served mostly as a driver. ""He had a desk inside my office,"" Brantley said. ""If I didn’t have a need for him I’d have him go and do patrol duty. He would actually go on the street and stop speeders."" Brantley said that Brogan was the first one he recalled with ""an actual plainclothes security detailing talking in their sleeve and all that stuff."" Kottkamp, now a lawyer in Tallahassee, said the security detail ""came with the job."" ""On the night Gov. Crist and I were elected — they showed up at the hotel,"" he said. ""Someone was with me and the governor from that point on. It was a responsibility the FHP took very seriously. FHP leadership viewed it as a legal obligation to insure continuity of government."" Carroll said troopers would pick her up to provide security when she traveled to other parts of the state. Our ruling Lopez-Cantera said, ""I'm also the only lieutenant governor to not take a security detail."" He went without a security detail when he started in 2014 — a break from most lieutenant governors in recent memory who have used state security. The only one we could find who said he did not have security detail was Jim Williams, lieutenant governor from 1975-79. The state could not confirm one way or another. That was about 40 years ago, so to us Lopez-Cantera’s point still holds water. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f3425ea7-664c-4d1c-9bc5-bb771765d290",/factchecks/2016/may/26/carlos-lopez-cantera/carlos-lopez-cantera-says-he-only-florida-lieutena/

Hillary Clinton faults Donald Trump for hoping for real estate crash that led to the Great Recession
","The commercial seems like an example of the old adage, ""Be careful what you wish for."" Democrat Hillary Clinton posted the ad, which we caught on Instagram, on May 24 slamming Republican Donald Trump for saying he would welcome a burst in the housing bubble affecting real estate prices a decade ago. ""In 2006, Donald Trump was hoping for a real estate crash,"" it says, showing a picture of Trump giving two thumbs up. The ad goes on to list consequences from the Great Recession, which peaked in 2008. It lists 9 million jobs lost and 5 million families who lost their homes. ""And the man who could be our next president was rooting for it to happen,"" the ad contends. That's followed by audio, identified as being from 2006, of Trump saying, ""I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy ... If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you could make a lot of money."" ""If Donald wins,"" the ad concludes, ""you lose."" The Instagram description accompanying the video says, ""Millions of Americans lost jobs and homes in the '08 crash. A man who hoped for it has no business being president."" We wondered if there was more to the story. The Trump campaign didn't respond to our emails. When we emailed the Clinton campaign, they sent us two links. A May 19 CNN story offers details of Trump's comment, along with context. A May 23 story from NBC News shows that Trump's remark wasn't a one-time affair. His statement reported in the Clinton ad comes from the audiobook How to Build a Fortune, created as part of Trump University, which has been the subject of three lawsuits from former ""students"" who allege they were ripped off by the billionaire. In 2006, real estate values had peaked and there was concern that they were overpriced, creating a ""bubble"" that could burst, producing a rapid fall in values. The man interviewing Trump for the audiobook says, ""There's a lot of talk, which you've no doubt heard too, about a so-called real estate bubble. What's your take on that pessimism?"" ""Well first of all, I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy. You know, if you're in a good cash position — which I'm in a good cash position today — then people like me would go in and buy like crazy,"" he says in a portion of the audiobook posted by CNN. ""If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you can make a lot of money."" Whether the ""bubble burst"" that Trump was hoping for deserves to be called a ""crash,"" especially a crash on the scale of what occurred during the Great Recession, is open to debate. But it's important to stress that Trump was doing nothing than articulating an investment principle — look for a bargain. Good investors, he was arguing, should buy low and sell high. More importantly, in the audio book, Trump immediately adds: ""At the same time, I don't think that (real estate bubble burst) will happen because if interest rates stay fairly low, if the dollar stays pretty much where it is or even goes a little bit higher, but basically if you have a weak dollar, this is tremendous amounts of money pouring in, so I don't think that's going to happen. I'm not a believer that the interest market, that the real estate market, is going to take a big hit."" Obviously, he would turn out to be wrong. A year later, in 2007, Trump was telling the Toronto Globe and Mail that he was ready to invest in real estate because the market was starting to head down. ""People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I'm excited if it is,"" he told the paper. ""I've always made more money in bad markets than in good markets."" But, once again, it's clear that Trump didn't see what was coming. The story begins: ""Donald Trump almost lost his shirt 15 years ago when the North American real estate bubble burst. The 2007 version of that disaster will be much more benign, the real estate magnate predicts. . .  'We're talking very minor (problems) compared with the depression of the early 1990s,' Mr. Trump said."" The story said he was advising investors that there are now great deals in buying subprime mortgages at a discount and repossessed houses at low prices. In short, even as the events that sparked the Great Recession were unfolding, Trump was not predicting the size and the scope of the economic disaster. Our ruling Clinton said, ""In 2006, Donald Trump was hoping for a real estate crash."" He said on more than one occasion that he welcomed a downturn in the real estate market because it would give him a chance to buy properties at a bargain and sell them at a higher price later. That's the essence of profitable investing. What's far less clear is whether Trump was rooting for something on the scale of the Great Recession, a suggestion made in the Clinton ad. In fact, his comments in his audiobook and to the Globe and Mail show that he didn't envision the financial meltdown that followed. Because Clinton's statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/476b3221-a0ce-40cc-ba96-56605fcd50b1",/factchecks/2016/may/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-faults-donald-trump-hoping-real-es/

John Cornyn says Vietnamese third most common language spoken in Texas
","John Cornyn recently stressed that Communist Vietnam, visited by President Barack Obama, needs to improve its human rights record. Cornyn opened his Senate floor remarks, though, by calling Vietnamese residents of his home state of Texas ""some of the most accomplished people."" The second-term Republican added: ""Many are surprised when I tell them that Vietnamese is the third most commonly spoken language in Texas."" English is most-spoken, Cornyn told his colleagues, with Spanish ranking No. 2. Makes sense. But we wondered about his Vietnamese language claim. By email, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie told us Cornyn reached his conclusion based on U.S. Census bureau charts on languages spoken at home posted in October 2015. By far, according to the bureau’s 2009-2013 American Community Survey, English and Spanish were most-spoken at home in Texas--and Vietnamese placed a distant third, . Brandewie also noted news accounts that cited the bureau data including a November 2015 Texas Tribune story. A chart with the Tribune story presents the state’s most-spoken languages other than English under this summary: ""Of the nearly 24 million people in Texas five years or older, 65 percent speak only English at home. The rest speak more than 160 languages combined."" Top 10 languages other than English spoken in Texas households Language Number of Speakers Spanish 6,983,380 Vietnamese 193,408 Chinese* 140,971 Tagalog 72,248 German 69,140 French 60,730 Hindi 59,602 Urdu 57,662 Korean 55,794 Arabic 55,304 *Includes Cantonese, Mandarin other Chinese languages SOURCES: News story, "" As Texas Grows, More Languages are Spoken at Home,"" Texas Tribune, Nov. 26, 2015, chart citing 2009-2013 American Community Survey. Some 164 languages are lately spoken in Texas, the story said. Significantly, it said, changing ""immigration patterns are increasing the number of other foreign languages spoken in Texas households, from Vietnamese and Chinese to Tagalog, the language spoken in the Philippines."" 2014 census data Seeking the latest available data, we reached out to bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein who emailed us a breakdown drawing on results from the 2014 one-year ACS indicating that some 201,997 Texas residents age 5 or older speak Vietnamese at home. That count trailed only the 2014 survey’s tally of English-only speakers in Texas (16,126,855) and Spanish speakers (7,465,279). Some perspective; 65 percent of the estimated 25 million Texans age 5 or older speak only English at home, according to the survey, and 30 percent speak Spanish--while only 0.81 percent speak Vietnamese. That is, there’s a big dropoff from second to third place. Bernstein also provided national results on languages spoken at home. According to the 2014 ACS, 79 percent of the 299 million U.S. residents 5 or older speak only English, 13 percent speak Spanish and, in third place, about 5.5 percent speak French. Next, per the survey, 1 percent of residents speak Chinese at home with 0.5 percent, nearly 1.5 million residents, speaking Vietnamese. Longer view We also heard back from Lloyd Potter, the state demographer, who noted by email that according to the ACS covering 2010-2014, English, Spanish and Vietnamese were the three most-spoken languages in Texas. Those were followed, the five-year results suggest, by Chinese, other Asian languages, African languages, Tagalog, German, French and Urdu. Our ruling Cornyn said Vietnamese is the third-most-spoken language in Texas. Survey data supports this claim though English or Spanish is spoken by far more residents. We rate the claim True.

Donald Trump wrong that Hillary Clinton wants to release all violent criminals from prison
","Donald Trump didn’t mince words about Hillary Clinton’s criminal justice agenda when he addressed the National Rifle Association’s national convention on May 20, 2016. ""President Obama pushed for changes to sentencing laws that released thousands of dangerous drug trafficking felons and gang members who prey on civilians,"" Trump said. He continued, ""This is Hillary Clinton's agenda, too, to release the violent criminals from jail. She wants them all released."" We think most observers would agree that releasing every violent criminal in American prisons would amount to political suicide, not to mention bad policy. But we thought it was worth checking Clinton's actual policy prescriptions. What Trump said is far off-base. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) Existing criminal-justice reform efforts Trump said Clinton wants to continue Obama’s release of ""thousands of dangerous drug trafficking felons and gang members."" But Trump overreaches both on the substance of the policy and on Obama’s personal role in enacting it. In recent years, liberals and conservatives have increasingly found common ground over criminal justice reform. Many on the left, center and right -- including the libertarian Koch brothers and the generally more liberal American Civil Liberties Union -- have come to agree that many tough-on-crime policies instituted between the 1970s and the 1990s were misguided. They argue that policies such as mandatory minimum sentences and tough prosecution of low-level drug offenders have led to overcrowded prisons and exacerbated racial injustices. Obama has taken some steps to unwind these policies. Using his pardon powers, Obama has commuted the sentences of more than 200 inmates who had been convicted of drug crimes, though it’s important to note -- as Trump does not -- that all of them have been considered nonviolent under Justice Department guidelines. In addition, during Obama’s tenure, the Justice Department has approved the release of 6,000 federal inmates, about two-thirds of them to halfway houses or home confinement and about one-third who are expected to be deported. Unlike the commutations, these releases were prompted not by Obama but by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, an independent body. In unanimously approving the changes, the panel estimated that the reduced sentencing guidelines could eventually qualify 46,000 of roughly 100,000 drug offenders in federal prisons for early release, according to the Washington Post. (It does not affect the larger pool of offenders in state prisons.) And federal judges must approve all early releases. Though applicants for early release typically have a connection to drug trafficking, the releases are not intended to free drug-traffickers and gang members who have a record of violence, as Trump contends. Obama’s then-Attorney General Eric Holder actually proposed excluding convicts who had used weapons or had significant criminal histories, but the commission put its trust in judges to weigh those factors on a case-by-case basis, the Post reported. The commission submitted the proposal to Congress in April 2014, and Congress did nothing to stop the proposal from taking effect six months later. What Clinton supports Clinton does support criminal justice reform, but we found no evidence that her plan includes the release of ""violent criminals,"" much less ""all"" of them. For starters, we should note that the Sentencing Commission’s action is now a done deal. Short of calling on the commission to reverse itself -- which the panel, being independent, could simply ignore -- or passing a law through Congress, there isn’t really anything Clinton (or Trump) could easily do to stop the forthcoming early releases. And of course, federal judges, not the president, are the ones who must sign off on applications for early release. More broadly, we looked at Clinton’s stated proposals for criminal justice policy and found that she focused her initiatives only on ""nonviolent"" offenders. The Clinton campaign said Trump’s comment is a misrepresentation of her views. On the criminal justice reform page of her website, Clinton summarizes her key proposals as follows: • ""End the era of mass incarceration, reform mandatory minimum sentences, and end private prisons."" • ""Encourage the use of smart strategies — like police body cameras — and end racial profiling to rebuild trust between law enforcement and communities."" • ""Help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully re-enter society."" It’s worth noting that Clinton focuses more on what happens before prison (such as sentencing of people not currently incarcerated) and after prison (especially reintegrating ex-convicts into society after they are released) than actually releasing current inmates. ""Clinton has not focused on early release,"" said John H. Laub, a professor in criminology and criminal justice at the University of Maryland. For a politician, this is a canny omission, because it sidesteps difficult questions about who should be released early. ""There is little consensus about releasing violent criminals from prison before their terms end,"" said Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ""Then there is the question of who is ‘violent.’ Someone who has a prior record for a violent crime but whose current charge is for a nonviolent crime. or only those with a current charge for violence?"" But even if Clinton is sidestepping a thorny issue by remaining largely silent on which, if any, inmates deserve early release, that position does throw a wrench into Trump’s accusation that it’s her stated ""agenda"" to ""release"" violent criminals. If anything, Clinton’s policy page bends over backward to focus her attention on ""nonviolent,"" rather than violent, offenders. Proposals specify ""nonviolent"" offenders no fewer than seven times. This consistent focus on nonviolent offenders undermines the notion that Clinton wants to release violent offenders at all, much less to do so willy-nilly. Our ruling Trump said it ""is Hillary Clinton's agenda"" to ""release the violent criminals from jail. She wants them all released."" It would be preposterous for any politician who wants to win an election to propose freeing every violent criminal from jail. Like many political figures today on the right, center and left, Clinton supports something much more modest — easing how the criminal justice system treats nonviolent offenders. That’s a far cry from saying Clinton is poised to set free everyone from Charles Manson to Unabomber Ted Kaczynski.

Did Will Hurd vote for a border security bill that would cut up Big Bend National Park?
","U.S. Rep. Will Hurd paints himself as a defender of Big Bend National Park after penning a June 9, 2015 letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission calling for greater federal oversight in construction of the Trans-Pecos Pipeline. But former Rep. Pete Gallego, the Alpine Democrat, doesn’t see Hurd, R-Helotes, as much of friend to the national park, which includes 118 miles of U.S.-Mexico border and is located entirely within the sprawling 23rd Congressional District of Texas. Gallego is challenging Hurd in a November 8 general election, a rematch that saw Gallego lose to Hurd two years ago in the ""swing"" congressional district. Gallego has gone after Hurd’s voting record as a defender of the national park in an attack ad and news releases. In an April 22, 2016 press release, Gallego said Hurd co-sponsored ""a bill that would militarize our border and allow 200 miles of new roads to be built in the Big Bend region -- cutting up our beloved park."" Gallego said he was concerned about the Secure Our Borders First Act, or House Resolution 399, introduced by Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, on Jan. 16, 2015. The bill would bring an increase in federal agents and hundreds of new miles of roads to Texas’ most scenic area. In a Jan. 17, 2015 video, McCaul said his measure sets new infrastructure requirements for each U.S. Customs and Border Protection sector along the entire U.S.-Mexico border and provides penalties to step up security. According to congressional records, Hurd was one of 15 original cosponsors of HR 399. Ten of the original cosponsors were Texas Republicans; all of the bill’s cosponsors, totalling 29 representatives as of Jan. 22, 2015, were Republicans. The bill authorizes new roads across the entire southern U.S. border with Mexico, and it specifies construction in what U.S. Customs and Border Enforcement calls the Big Bend sector. The sector, formerly called the Marfa sector, encompasses 77 Texas counties and the state of Oklahoma — 165,154 square miles. The Hurd-backed measure, which cleared the McCaul-chaired House Committee on Homeland Security on Jan. 21, 2015, requires 192 miles of road to be built in the Big Bend sector federal land, which includes the national park. It also authorizes three Forward Operating Bases with detention space, power and water, and a helicopter landing zone, and six miles of vehicle fencing. To our query about the backup for Gallego’s claim, campaign spokesman Anthony Gutierrez pointed out by email that ""the legislation in question specifically directs the chief of Border Patrol to prioritize the ‘physical land border’ and to move personnel to the border...Big Bend National Park is on the border."" The bill also waives 16 different federal laws relating to historical preservation, conservation and the environment — a major reason why a coalition of 85 environmental advocacy groups including the Sierra Club opposed the bill in a Jan. 27, 2015 letter to Congress. It also forbids the Agriculture and Interior secretaries from restricting Customs and Border Protection activity on federal land located within 100 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, for the purposes of conducting a list of activities that begins with ""Construction and maintenance of roads."" Dan Millis of the Sierra Club’s Borderlands program said: ""Oftentimes these supposed border bills are disguised as border bills but they’re really public land attacks,"" he said. ""In addition to waiving these important laws, the miles of border walls cause flooding, fragment wildlife habitat, and block wildlife migration corridors, and they don’t work—people are able to climb walls."" Unlike states to the west, Texas doesn’t have much federal land along the border — only Big Bend, a wildlife refuge in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, and the small Amistad Canyon National Recreational Area. That doesn’t mean that the roads the bill requires would necessarily be built in the park, but it does mean there would be less of a logistical hurdle to building roads in the park than elsewhere in the sector, since the government could skip the hassle of eminent domain claims on private land. To our inquiry, Justin Hollis, Hurd's campaign manager , said by email that the bill ""would not authorize hundreds of miles of roads through the park or threaten natural habitats."" Hollis pointed out that the Big Bend sector for Customs and Border Protection is far larger than just Big Bend National Park. But many of the provisions in the bill are specific to areas within 100 miles of the border or targeted at increasing ""border accessibility."" Because environmental protection laws would be waived, Gallego claims the bill would allow roads to be built in the park — but how likely is it that the roads would actually go through the park, as opposed to elsewhere in the sector? To find out where the roads might go, we spoke to Homeland Security committee staffer Paul Anstine. ""The law mileage that you see in the bill were developed in close consultation with stakeholders like"" the Border Patrol ""and other people who are involved in the border security business but specifically where mile ‘x’ of 190 would go, that’s something that, in general, we defer to the executive branch,"" Anstine said, adding that the Border Patrol ""is probably in the best position to tell you where each and every mile of the road needs to go, what areas they need access to."" Anstine also pointed out that since the 2005 passage into law of the Real ID Act, it has been within the power of the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive laws protecting national parks for border security purposes. By email, Bill Brooks, Supervisory Public Affairs Specialist for CBP in Marfa, said he would not comment on pending legislation, but that the CBP sector and the park have ""an excellent working relationship. In fact we have agents who live and work in the park. Additionally, we are most respectful of the environment in the park. As a matter of fact, when it is time to go off road to pursue illegal immigrants, we do it on horseback."" We wondered whether other federal agencies might be able to shed light on the bill. A Jan. 22, 2015 statement by Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson offered a sharp rebuke of the policies outlined in the bill, calling them counterproductive and ""not a serious effort at legislating border security — and its authors know it."" ""The bill is extreme to the point of being unworkable; if enacted, it would actually leave the border less secure. The bill sets mandatory and highly prescriptive standards that the Border Patrol itself regards as impossible to achieve, undermines the Department of Homeland Security’s capacity to adapt to emerging threats, and politicizes tactical decisions,"" Johnson wrote. Our ruling Gallego said Hurd ""cosponsored a bill that would militarize our border and allow 200 miles of new roads to be built in the Big Bend region -- cutting up our beloved park."" Gallego accurately recapped key elements of the Secure Our Borders First Act backed by Hurd and other Texas Republicans in the House. The legislation would clear the way for construction of 192 miles of new roads, towers and law enforcement facilities along the border on federal lands in the vast Big Bend region of Texas. But whether these mandated moves entail carving up the treasured national park remains to be seen—or at least, Gallego didn’t prove nor could we confirm that outcome. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE, 6:00 p.m., May 27, 2016: After we published this fact check, the Gallego campaign pointed out that the Hurd-backed bill exempts both private and state-owned land, leaving only federal lands available for construction of roads and other border security measures called for in the legislation. We’ve corrected this fact check to show this exemption; it did not change our rating of this claim.",/factchecks/2016/may/26/pete-gallego/did-will-hurd-vote-border-security-bill-would-cut-/
