Texas Public Policy Foundation says Texas created more jobs than all other states combined in past 5 years
","
The president of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, Brooke Rollins, touts Texas’ economic strength in a TV ad that aired in April and May, saying that ""in the last five years, we’ve created more jobs than all other states combined."" 
After a reader asked us to check Rollins’ claim, Joshua Trevino, a foundation spokesman, pointed us to information the foundation culled from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly employment data — specifically, figures from the Current Employment Statistics series, which is calculated using a broad survey of employer payroll data. 
First, the foundation identified those states where the number of jobs had grown between January 2006 and January 2011. There were only 10 states in that group. Texas ranked No. 1, with an increase of 545,900 jobs, from about 9.93 million to about 10.47 million. The other nine states, ranging in size from Louisiana to Wyoming, had a combined jobs increase of 183,700. 
However, that's not to say jobs weren’t lost in Texas during those years. Employment numbers fluctuate. At the state’s most recent peak, in August 2008, Texas had about 10.64 million jobs. About a year later, with the recession in full swing, Texas had about 400,000 less. 
Next, we asked the Texas Workforce Commission about the foundation’s claim. Lisa Givens, an agency spokeswoman, sent us a 50-state comparison of job growth also using monthly BLS figures. However, Givens’ accounting covered a more recent five-year period, March 2006 to March 2011 — numbers for which were still preliminary. Nine states, including Texas, had more jobs in March 2011 than in that month five years earlier. And Texas’ gains far outpaced the combined total for the other states: 539,500 vs. 134,400. 
So, the foundation’s figures stand up — in the way that such figures are often analyzed, including by PolitiFact. 
Unsaid is that this gauge defines job creation as a net increase in employment. That means the foundation’s analysis only takes into account the number of jobs created in excess of the number lost over a five-year period. 
But new jobs also sprung up in the other 40 states, although they were offset by greater losses. Is it fair to assess job creation without including them? 
We’ve gone back and forth on that question. 
In September 2010, we rated True the statement by Gov. Rick Perry that Texas had ""created more than 850,000 jobs, more than all the other states combined."" To come up with that number, Perry’s campaign also looked at net job growth, although over a longer time period: January 2001 to June 2010. 
During our research of the Perry statement, Cheryl Abbot, a BLS economist in Dallas, told us that the governor’s statement was correct. We touched base with her again on the foundation’s TV statement, which she said has a legitimate basis. 
However, in January 2010, we rated False a statement from Perry that ""approximately 70 percent of the jobs created in the U.S. from November 2007-2008 were in Texas."" We found that the Texas Workforce Commission, like the Texas Public Policy Foundation, had restricted its comparison to the states that experienced a net increase in employment; during the specified time period, there were 14 total, including Texas. 
While we researched that item, Michael Brandl, a senior lecturer at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, told us that excluding all those states with net job losses — and disregarding any jobs gained in those states — exaggerates the Texas share of total new jobs in the U.S. 
""To say it's misleading is to be kind,"" Brandi said. ""It's just not true."" 
The Truth-O-Meter score so far: one ruling that favors net increases in employment as a valid gauge of job creation — and one that doesn’t. 
Seeking more clarity, we turned to Jason Faberman, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia who has written an article on the BLS data sources. He agreed that it could be misleading to consider only net increases in jobs as ""job creation."" But, he said, the public is accustomed to hearing it discussed that way. 
""When most policy, political and media people refer to jobs ‘created’ or ‘added,’ they are referring to the net gain in employment over some period,"" Faberman said. 
Givens, at the workforce commission, told us that when the agency refers to net employment gains, it says jobs were added rather than created. 
What happens if you look at total jobs created, not just the net gain? Then Texas is no longer No. 1. The BLS keeps annual data, starting from April 1 each year, on total private sector job gains and losses. During the most recent three years — 2008, 2009 and 2010 — California gained an average of 1.3 million jobs annually, while Texas posted an average of 935,000 jobs. However, California also lost an average of 1.8 million jobs while Texas lost 992,000. 
However, Abbot cautioned that gross job numbers generally reflect a state’s population, meaning that big states would post bigger numbers than small ones. ""There’s no way that a Kansas could compare with a Texas,"" Abbot said. 
Faberman agreed that comparing gross job gains isn’t the best way to fact-check the foundation’s statement. Instead, he suggested comparing Texas’ net employment change with that of the whole country, minus Texas’ share. What we found: In January 2011, the United States, excluding Texas, had 5.3 million fewer jobs than it did in January 2006 — the five-year period used by the foundation. That compares with the 545,900 increase that Texas experienced during that time. 
So, by Faberman’s measure, Texas outperformed the rest of the country. 
We came across another way of thinking about job creation in an Aug. 24 blog on the Houston Chronicle’s website. According to the post, an unidentified economist noted that any ""raw job count would naturally favor"" Texas in a comparison with other net-gain states and asked what would happen if the size of the states’ job forces were factored in. The Chronicle did that by calculating the percentage increase in the states’ jobs between July 2009 and July 2010, and Texas still came out on top — but barely. 
Inspired by the Chronicle, we looked again at the 10 states with net job gains over the last five years. Texas’ gains represented a 5.5 percent increase in employment from January 2006 to January 2011. For the nine other states, their total increase of 183,700 jobs was a 2.5 percent increase. 
However, comparing the states individually, two had larger percentage increases than Texas: North Dakota (10.6 percent) and Alaska (5.7 percent). 
Another factor that changes — even reverses — the job creation numbers is the time frame. The longer the time frame, the better Texas’ numbers look. Comparing employment in a single month in 2006 with the same month five years later, Texas’ job numbers grow. Shorten the time period to three years, and Texas shows a net loss in jobs, going from 10.56 million jobs in January 2008 to 10.47 million in January 2011. 
So what’s our (latest) ruling on job creation? 
The foundation’s claim that Texas ""created more jobs than all other states combined"" stands up — considering only those states that had net job gains over five years. That’s the methodology usually used to define job creation in public discourse. 
But the foundation’s analysis disregards the 40 states where millions of jobs were created but were outnumbered by losses. And looking at the percentage increase in jobs relative to the size of each state’s work force — another telling statistic — two other states experienced greater gains than Texas. 
We rate the foundation’s statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979E49C0>],/factchecks/2011/may/29/texas-public-policy-foundation/texas-public-policy-foundation-says-texas-created-/

Email message says members of Congress get a full pension for serving just one term
","In an era when government pension benefits are under a lot of scrutiny, in part because retirement programs are costly and underfunded, it's not surprising that members of Congress would have the terms of their benefit package questioned as well.

One unsigned email sent to us a few times in recent weeks begins: ""No one has been able to explain to me why young men and women serve in the U.S. military for 20 years, risking their lives protecting freedom, and only get 50 percent of their pay, while politicians hold their political positions in the safe confines of the capital, protected by these same men and women, and receive full pay retirement after serving one term. It just does not make any sense.""

It goes on to say, ""Many citizens had no idea that members of Congress could retire with the same pay after only one term.""

For a rank-and-file member of the House of Representatives paid $174,000 per year, that would mean full pay for the rest of their lives after serving as little as two years.

What a deal! But is it a real deal? We wanted to find out.

It didn't take us long to uncover a federal report, released in January, on ""Retirement Benefits for Members of Congress"" prepared for Congress by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. It outlines how pension benefits are calculated.

The key provision: no member of Congress is eligible for any pension unless he or she has served in Congress for at least five years. (Senators serve six-year terms; House members must seek reelection every two years.)

To collect, a congressman or senator must be age 62, or be age 50 with 20 years of service, or be any age with 25 years of service.

Under the most recent pension program, adopted in 1984, the size of a pension is based on the highest three years of a member's salary, the number of years of service and a multiplier, which is 1.7 percent for the first 20 years of service and 1.0 percent for subsequent years. (Typically, for a 25-year rank-and-file member who retired this year, the pension would be the sum of two calculations. First, take $172,443 [the average salary over the last three years] times 20 years times 0.017. Then, add that to $172,443 times 5 years times 0.01. The total: $67,249 per year.)

A three-term congressman (or one-term senator) who has now reached retirement age would be eligible for an annual pension of $17,588 for six years of work. That's extremely generous, but not even close to full pay. (Members of Congress are also eligible for Social Security.)

Finally, federal law prevents them from getting full-pay retirement when they leave office. The report says, ""By law, the starting amount of a member's retirement annuity may not exceed 80 percent of his or her final salary."" (Under the formula, it would take 67 years of service to hit that limit.)

So the email saying that members of Congress can ""receive full pay retirement after serving one term"" is blatantly bogus. It's never full pay and the only one-term members who would be eligible for any pension would be senators.

This claim has been around the rotunda a few times. Our friends at Snopes.com have emails dating to 2000 reporting that senators and congressmen, when they retire, continue to draw the same paycheck until they die. FactCheck.org has also debunked the email.

Over the years the claim has been accompanied by assertions that members of Congress don't pay into their Social Security (they have since 1984) or they don't contribute anything toward their retirement (they do), or that they are exempt from the new health-care law or claims of sexual harassment (they're not).

A quick Google search with the words ""congress"" ""full"" ""pay"" and ""retirement"" would reveal the truth. But too many people prefer to make the seat-of-the-slacks decision to simply spread the myth to family and friends. So for them, and the original author of this ill-informed email, we break out the matches and lighter fluid and give them a Pants On Fire!

Armstrong says jobs are down in Southside and Southwest Va. under Gov. McDonnell
","
News that StarTek is closing its Henry County call center has reignited the debate over Gov. Bob McDonnell’s economic record.

Shortly after the county’s biggest private employer announced it will shutter the facility with 631 jobs, House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong, D-Henry, criticized the Republican governor’s efforts to boost employment in depressed rural regions.

""The McDonnell-Bolling administration has been touting the creation of jobs throughout Southside and Southwest Virginia,"" Armstrong said in a May 23 news release. ""But the administration has not been able to create more jobs than have been lost. Unless that trend is changed we will continue to go backwards.""

No doubt, the economic picture in some parts of the state has been bleak, particularly in the Martinsville-Henry County area that Armstrong represents.

In Martinsville alone, the March unemployment rate was a 17.8 percent. That was than more  double the national unemployment rate of 8.8 percent that month. Virginia’s unemployment rate, meanwhile, was 6.2 percent in March.

Still we wondered if the situation has worsened under McDonnell’s watch.

We asked Claire Wilker, Armstrong’s chief of staff, where he got the information for his statement. She cited a number of eliminations announced by a number of companies over the last year.

""But the reality is all you need to do is spend some time down in Henry County or anywhere in Southside to realize that more people are being laid off than there are jobs being created to be filled,"" Wilker said in an e-mail.

Outside StarTek, the biggest cut was Stanley Furniture’s announcement in May 2010 that it was cutting 530 jobs at its Henry County factory.

She included announcements dating back to April 2009, but we only counted the ones that occurred after McDonnell was sworn in on Jan. 16, 2010. We came up with announcements of 1,386 jobs cut and 1,159 positions created.

But data from the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, a public-private organization that recruits businesses  for Virginia, paints a rosier picture of Southside and Southwest. It lists new and expanding business deals that promised 3,117 new jobs in the two regions since February 2010, McDonnell’s first full month in office. That’s almost three times the number Armstrong’s aide offered.

We could not find a similar data base listing businesses closings or layoffs.

Not every job loss or job gain makes it into a headline or a news release. So we started digging for data that would better establish the employment trend in Southside and Southwestern Virginia during the McDonnell administration.

We turned to the state government’s Virginia Performs website to get a list of localities in each region. Southside Virginia includes the cities of Danville, Martinsville and Emporia as well as a dozen counties in the south-central part of the state.

The Southwest region includes the cities of Bristol, Galax and Norton as well as 14 counties down by the borders of Tennessee and North Carolina.

We looked to the Virginia Employment Commission’s website for figures showing the number of jobs in each county and city in those two regions. Economists typically measure that by counting the number of jobs reported in a survey of businesses in an area.

The problem is that at the county level, those jobs numbers are only available through September 2010. That takes us only about halfway into the McDonnell administration. So we can’t find a net number on how many jobs were gained or lost since the governor took office.

But we can look at the results of another survey that reports how many people in each city or county in those two regions report having a job.

The VEC website has compiled data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing the total number of people employed in each county and city in Southside and Southwestern Virginia. Those raw numbers are not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, such as spikes in summer hiring.

To make up for that, we looked at the how the number of employed people in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2011 in each region. We compared the first three months of each year because those months most closely align with the start of McDonnell’s term and with the latest figures that are available.

In Southwestern Virginia, an average of 180,306 people were employed each month from January through March of 2011. That was 3,673 people more than the average number of workers employed during the first quarter of 2010.

We found a similar situation in Southside, where a monthly average of 157,018 people had jobs in the first quarter of 2011, compared with 153,813 employed residents in the first quarter of 2010.

So the number of people working in each region went up between the first quarter of each year.

Unemployment rates went down in 30 of the 32 localities in Southside and Southwest Virginia, according to figures from the first quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011. Bucking the trend were Southampton County and Galax.

Let’s look at the employment picture the way a job seeker would -- by the number of positions open.

In the Southside, the average monthly number of job postings was 9,132 in the first quarter of 2011, according to VEC statistics. In the first quarter of 2010, it was 5,904.

In Southwest, job listings also markedly rose. The average number of postings each month in the first quarter of 2010 was 3,997. In the first quarter of 2011, there was an average 7,489 each month.

A final note: We don’t suggest McDonnell deserves credit or blame for employment trends in Southside, Southwest or anywhere else in Virginia.  As we have noted many times, economists have repeatedly told us governors have a limited impact on their state economies and get too much credit when things go well and too much grief when they don’t.

To sum up:

Armstrong said that there has been a net loss in jobs in the Southwestern and Southside parts of Virginia.

There is no comprehensive data on which to base such a sweeping claim about the regions’ job losses under McDonnell. The only data available at the county level covers nine months of McDonnell’s 16-month term.

But there are other statistics showing that under McDonnell, more people in those regions are employed and the number of job postings have increased.

We rate his Armstrong’s claim False.

"['Bipartisanship', 'Candidate Biography', 'Elections', 'Pundits', 'Redistricting', 'Texas', 'Rush Limbaugh']","
Rush Limbaugh says Rick Perry tracked down Democrats who fled Texas
","Conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh, declaring that Texas Gov. Rick Perry is toying with running for president in 2012, has praised him for opposing abortion and amnesty for illegal immigrants -- and for tracking down Democrats.

According to a transcript of Limbaugh’s May 18 program posted online, Limbaugh said: ""Rick Perry’s the guy that tracked these Democrats that left the state down. Remember they ran out, just like the Wisconsin Democrats did,"" a reference to the 14 Wisconsin state senators who left the Badger State for about a month this year in an attempt to stop legislation reducing the collective-bargaining rights of many state workers.

Limbaugh, who didn’t respond to an email seeking the backup for that claim, was surely referring to one of two bygone events in the Texas Legislature: when House Democrats hied to Oklahoma in a May 2003 attempt to prevent action on a GOP-steered redraw of the state’s congressional districts, or when Senate Democrats similarly made a July 2003 run to New Mexico.

Both flights temporarily kept the respective chambers from having sufficient members to conduct business. Both also ended with the Democrats returning--and Republicans ultimately setting in place revised districts that resulted in GOP candidates capturing a majority of the state’s U.S. House seats.

Did Perry track down the departed D’s, as Limbaugh says?

News reports from those episodes suggest Senate Democrats were not ""tracked"" at all since their destination was quickly revealed; before leaving Austin on July 28, some gave interviews on the fact the senators were boarding private planes to Albuquerque.

The Houston Chronicle reported the next day that Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who presides over the Senate, said that since the senators had left the state, ""from a practical standpoint, there's not much we can do.""

But the earlier surprise departure of more than 50 House Democrats on May 12, 2003, stirred search actions that involved Republican heavyweights including Perry.

The Dallas Morning News reported on May 13, 2003, that the Democrats had been found the night before, based on a sighting of a private airplane belonging to former House Speaker Pete Laney, D-Hale Center. Laney had boarded his Piper Cheyenne with his pilot on May 12, taking off from Hale County Airport and landing at the Downtown Executive Airport in Ardmore about an hour later, the newspaper said, quoting an airport employee.

In a telephone interview, former News reporter Matt Stiles told us he drove to Ardmore from Dallas the same day after a colleague, Pete Slover, twigged the plane’s location. Stiles said he arrived at the Holiday Inn by 6 p.m., recognized Laney and then gathered comments from some House Democrats that became part of the paper’s scoop that evening.

The News said that four Texas DPS officers, in plain clothes, also made it to the hotel in the wake of the Democrats. That evening, the newspaper said, the troopers spent most of their time sitting in the hotel lobby, with cars and planes at the ready for transporting anyone who volunteered to return to Austin.

The News quoted a DPS captain saying: ""We came at the request of the governor's office to make contact and to inform them that their services are still needed in Austin. They have chosen to stay here."" The newspaper said the troopers planned to depart by midnight.

Next, we contacted Bob Richter, former spokesman for then-House Speaker Tom Craddick. Richter told us that the day the Democrats vamoosed, Perry appeared ""gung-ho on getting them back"" and ""brought a bunch of people together to try to find them."" A command post was set up next to the speaker's office. At one point, Richter said, he saw Perry in his office calling out the number on the tail of Laney’s plane.

A subsequent Morning News article on May 23, 2003 said that in the early hours of the search, a DPS lieutenant had called the federal Department of Homeland Security seeking the whereabouts of Laney's plane. Homeland Security officials released a partial transcript of the call and said the DPS officer had misled them into believing the plane had crashed, the newspaper reported.

According to a May 28, 2003, Houston Chronicle article, House General Investigating Committee Chairman Kevin Bailey, D-Houston said Capitol security tapes showed Perry entering and leaving Craddick’s office on May 12. Bailey also said that Perry's homeland defense coordinator - Assistant Attorney General Jay Kimbrough - gave the DPS a California phone number for Homeland Security’s air interdiction service, which tracks terrorists and smugglers.

The governor wasn’t the only one looking for the Dems. U.S. Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, then the House majority leader, said his staff asked the Federal Aviation Administration to find Laney’s plane, according to the May 23 Morning News story. The report quotes DeLay saying that when he learned the plane was en route from Ardmore to an airport north of Austin, he passed the information to Craddick.

The San Antonio Express-News reported June 5, 2003, that Perry at one point directed a DPS official where to send Texas Rangers to hunt for two missing Democrats -- an order that the newspaper said ""directly contradicts the governor's longstanding contention that he wasn't involved in the DPS search for Democratic lawmakers who fled Austin to kill a congressional redistricting bill.""

According to the newspaper, the DPS official, Lt. Will Crais, described as the ranking officer at the command post set up at the Capitol, testified in a lawsuit brought against.the DPS by a Democratic legislator. The newspaper reported that Crais said Perry ""began asking me numerous questions"" and eventually ordered that Rangers be dispatched to Galveston and to Brownsville, where it was thought that Rep. Craig Eiland, D-Galveston, and Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, were hiding.

Neither legislator was there. Eiland was in Ardmore and Oliveira was in Matamoros, Mexico, across the Rio Grande from his hometown, the Express-News reported.  

Perry's spokeswoman, Kathy Walt, told the newspaper that Perry issued no such orders. Throughout, Walt had described the governor as having no involvement in the hunt beyond checking on its status.

According to a June 5, 2003, Austin American-Statesman news article citing Crais’ testimony, Craddick was the one who told the DPS the missing lawmakers were in Ardmore.

Perry’s office didn’t immediately respond when asked about Limbaugh’s claim that he pinpointed the Dems. Craddick issued a statement saying: ""That is not correct. Perry was not the guy that tracked the Democrats down.""

Our sense: Perry was trying to find the missing lawmakers. His homeland defense coordinator and the Department of Public Safety were joined in that effort, which also involved federal agencies, and the governor reportedly directed the Texas Rangers to two Texas cities.

But it was a news organization that got to the Democrats first.

Water savings plan doesn't escape Scott's veto pen
","
Among the $615 million in budget vetoes Florida Gov. Rick Scott announced at a ceremonial event May 26, 2011, Scott highlighted one -- $250,000, he said, earmarked to learn how to catch rainwater. ""Where I'm from, rainwater can be caught with a two-dollar bucket,"" he said.

Was that really in the budget?

Scott described the $250,000 in his list of vetoes as a ""water savings plan."" The list included the specific line item where the expenditure could be found in the 400-plus-page budget, so we went there to see if Scott described accurately what the money was for.

The money, it turns out, was tucked into the Department of Corrections budget.

Here's the exact language:

""From the funds in Specific Appropriations 595 through 688A, $250,000 in recurring general revenue funds is provided to the Department of Corrections to issue a request for proposal, as defined in section 287.057(1)(b), Florida Statutes, for the development of a water savings plan that creates performance standards for rain water harvesting and water reuse to achieve annual cost savings of at least 25 percent from the 2008, 2009, and 2010 calendar years. By no later than September 30, 2011, the department shall identify a vendor to conduct and inventory the water consumption of all department facilities consuming water for irrigation, gray water or drinking water purposes, including an inventory of each facility’s roof surface area. To achieve these cost savings objectives, the vendor shall submit a plan to the department by February 1, 2012, which identifies the most cost-effective plan for the procurement of services and cistern products and establishes performance standards for the efficient and effective use of water resources and estimates of future potential savings and other related benefits.""

In short, the $250,000 was to be spent to develop a plan to catch and collect rain water so that it could lower prison water costs by 25 percent. So while developing the plan would have cost the state $250,000, the idea was to save the state some money on water costs -- we don't know how much (and asked the Department of Corrections, for the record, but did not hear back).

""I'm sure most Floridians believe as I do that spending $250,000 on education materials for our kids is more important that spending a quarter of a million dollars to learn how to catch rainwater,"" Scott said in announcing the veto.

Where did the request for the money come from?

Not the Department of Corrections, said spokeswoman Gretl Plesinger. Plesinger said the money was not included in the department's legislative budget request.

And the money was not included in the version of the budget that initially passed the House.

In fact, it seems the idea came from someone in the Senate. The water savings plan was included in the original Senate budget proposal, and remained in the budget that the Senate initially passed. Actually, the Senate proposed spending $500,000 on the creation of the water savings plan. The amount was lowered to $250,000 as part of negotiations between the House and Senate.

There's no doubt, then, that Scott was right, that included in the 2011-12 budget was a $250,000 appropriation to develop a plan to catch and collect water (he said ""learn""). But there's an important note that he left out in announcing his budget vetoes. The budget language that included the appropriation said the water savings plan was supposed to reduce prison water costs by 25 percent. The savings could have offset or at least cut into the upfront investment. So we rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CD1480>],/factchecks/2011/may/27/rick-scott/water-savings-plan-doesnt-escape-rick-scotts-veto-/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Debbie Wasserman Schultz']","
Did the health care law add 12 years of solvency to Medicare?
","
Ever heard of  Medi-scare? It’s political slang that means attacking opponents for their plans to rein in Medicare spending. 
Republicans say they’re victims of Medi-scare because Democrats keep distorting their recent proposal, a plan to turn Medicare into a program where seniors buy their own health insurance plans and the federal government pays part of the tab. The plan wouldn’t apply to anyone 55 or older, but would start for new enrollees in 2022. Still, it would be a dramatic change from the current system, where the government pays doctors and hospitals directly. A Democrat won a close special election in upstate New York on May 24 after campaigning against the plan, prompting Republicans to complain that Democrats were demagoguing the plan. 
Boo hoo, say Democrats like Debbie Wasserman Schultz. It was just last year that Republicans tried to scare seniors by telling them the health care law would gut Medicare spending, said Wasserman Schultz, who was recently named head of the Democratic National Committee. 
""It's the pot calling the kettle black when it comes to who's engaging in Medi-scare,"" said Wasserman Schultz in an interview on MSNBC on May 25. ""The Republicans leading up to the 2010 election actually fabricated what Democrats did to Medicare. In fact, we added 12 years of solvency to Medicare and ensured that it would be better for seniors overall. And what the Republicans have done under Paul Ryan's plan is actually end Medicare as we know it, turn into it into a voucher program. There's no running from that."" 
We documented a slew of Mediscare ads against Democrats during the 2010 election cycle. But we were interested in the wonkier question of whether the health care law did indeed add 12 years of solvency to Medicare. Solvency in this case means the money flowing into Medicare covers 100 percent of the bills for patient care. 
We started researching the issue, and at first, Wasserman Schultz seemed on solid ground. In August 2010, the Medicare Board of Trustees reported that the health care law did indeed add 12 years of solvency to Medicare Part A, the portion of Medicare that covers hospitalization. It also improved the financial outlook for Part B, which covers physicians’ services and other care. The report specifically credited the Democratic health care law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed earlier that year. 
We should note those estimates come with a few warnings. The report itself says that projecting health care costs into the future includes many uncertainties. Additionally, the report doesn’t include changes that Congress will likely make to current law, especially the predictable increases in payments to physicians known as the doc fix. Also, the independent chief actuary for Medicare questioned whether the projected cost savings were realistic. 
But overall, the board of trustees report is an official estimate for the Medicare program, the reports are put together with a consistent, detailed methodology, and its annual reports are usually referred to by both parties. 
The bigger problem with Wasserman Schultz's statement is that just a few weeks ago, the board of trustees issued a new report that revised its estimates for the health care law. Instead of adding 12 years of solvency, the board concluded, the law will only add eight years of solvency. Starting in 2024, the program will need either new revenues or reduced expenses to meet all of its obligations. The board said the shortfall was because of the continuing economic slowdown, which has reduced the Medicare program’s income from taxes, and a few other lesser factors. 
So Wasserman Schultz’s number is off by about a third. 
Nevertheless, her overall point, that the Democrats’ health reform law added to the overall solvency of Medicare, is correct. The 2011 report included the same warnings that estimating health care savings for the future is an uncertain process, but it also concluded that the financial outlook for Medicare is ""substantially improved as a result of the changes in the Affordable Care Act."" 
The law reduced spending and increased revenues in several ways. It slows increases in payments to hospitals and nursing homes. It raises Medicare hospital taxes for high earners. And it introduces several new programs aimed at steering the health system away from paying doctors and hospitals per procedure (""fee for service"") and instead paying for good outcomes. 
When we contacted her office, a spokesman said that the number may have been off, but the point was still right. ""The important thing is that Democrats moved to substantially extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund while also making broad improvements to Medicare,"" said spokesman Jonathan Beeton. 
To summarize, Wasserman Schultz said that the Democratic health care law ""added 12 years of solvency to Medicare."" She’s off on the number, citing an older, more optimistic report. The latest estimate indicates Medicare will only have eight additional years of solvency, one-third less than the previous estimate. But she’s right that the Affordable Care Act improved the financial outlook for Medicare, and that Democrats have successfully passed legislation to reduce future spending for the program. So we rate her statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809731CBC0>],/factchecks/2011/may/27/debbie-wasserman-schultz/did-health-care-law-add-12-years-solvency-medicare/

Tim Kaine says unmarried couples should be allowed to adopt
","
Tim Kaine’s position on state adoption laws was well known when he was elected governor in 2005.

Kaine, then lieutenant governor, said he favored the laws on the book, which allowed both heterosexual married couples and single people -- regardless of sexual orientation -- to adopt.

The Democrat said he didn’t think unmarried couples, gay or straight, should be allowed to adopt. His opponent, Republican Jerry Kilgore, opposed any adoption by homosexual individuals.

Kaine said then the best interest of a child should always be the ultimate consideration in adoption cases. He said adoption by unmarried couples was a bad idea because of possible disputes over the child ""if the relationship breaks up.""

His position backed a state policy that eliminates gay couples from adopting because Virginia has never recognized same-sex marriages. Kaine said in 2005 that he did not support civil unions between homosexuals.

Let’s flash forward to 2011. In April, Kaine announced his 2012 candidacy for the U.S. Senate and the state’s Board of Social Services rejected a measure that would have banned private adoption groups, such as religious charities, from discriminating against prospective parents on the basis of sexual orientation.

In mid-May, Kaine told The Washington Post that he still thinks all adoption decisions should be made in a child’s best interest. But he said if a judge thinks adoption by an unmarried couple -- gay or straight -- meets that standard, then the couple should be allowed to complete the adoption.

""I think the best interest of the child is a pretty hard standard to argue with and I think that ought to be the standard,’’ said Kaine, the former governor who is now a candidate in the Democratic Senate primary.

Brandi Hoffine, Kaine’s campaign press secretary, told us her boss’s stance really hasn’t  changed.

""Governor Kaine's position has always been that judges should be empowered to do whatever is in the best interest of the child,"" she said.

Kaine’s overall position may not have changed, but the details have. He now thinks judges should be empowered to allow unmarried couples to adopt children. In 2005, he opposed letting unmarried couples to adopt.

Kaine has stopped short of urging the General Assembly to revamp laws so that unmarried couples could adopt. And his campaign for the U.S. Senate next year promises to focus on federal issues -- not state adoption laws, which he would have no control over if he is elected.

But Kaine’s position has evolved. We rate this a Half Flip. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280978BE7C0>],/factchecks/2011/may/27/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-unmarried-couples-should-be-allowed/

State Rep. Armond Budish says GOP-approved changes would cut early voting to just six days
","
Ohio’s Republican-led House recently passed a set of voting regulations that overhaul the state’s elections system. The proposed changes in House Bill 194 include allowing voters to change their address online, requiring people casting provisional ballot to provide additional forms of identity, eliminating the requirement that poll workers direct voters in the wrong precinct to the correct one and prohibiting elections boards from mailing absentee ballots to voters.

Among the controversial changes are new limits on early voting, which Democrats say amount to voter suppression. Republicans say the state needs more uniform voting regulations and less costly ways to manage elections.

Under the bill, voting by mail is cut to 21 days before an election, from 35 now. And in-person voting would be restricted to 10 days before an election.

This last point was one of several Democratic House Leader Armond Budish of Beachwood, railed against in a news release on May 18, the day the bill passed along party lines.

""Changes in House Bill 194 that make it more difficult to participate in Ohio elections include reducing in-person early voting from 35 days to 6,"" he said.

PolitiFact Ohio wondered how Budish came up with six days, given that the bill says 10 days.

Specifically the House Bill 194 reads: ""For all voters who are applying to vote absent voter’s ballots in person, ballots shall be printed and ready for use beginning on the tenth day before the day of the election.""

So how does Budish come up with 6 days?

His chief of staff, Keary McCarthy, said pay close attention to the bill’s language.

The bill goes on to say that in-person voting is prohibited on Sundays and must end the Friday before Election Day. Applying these restrictions to the 10 day-period, four days become off limits to voters: The first and last Sunday in the period and the Saturday and Monday immediately preceding Election Day.

The Ohio Senate, also controlled by Republicans, passed Senate Bill 148 that also makes significant changes to the election laws and processes. It mirrors the House Bill in many ways but offers some differences, which will be worked out in coming days among Republican leaders representing both chambers.

One of the differences between the two bills concerns in-person voting. The Senate’s version calls for in-person voting to begin 16 days before Election Day. But this window is also squeezed by prohibiting voting on Sundays and on the Saturday and Monday before Election Day. It also requires elections boards to close Saturday voting at noon. The House version allows for voting until 6 p.m.

Applying these restrictions, the Senate bill takes away five days, leaving 11 days for in-person voting.

Returning to the House bill and Budish’s assessment, his statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. On the Truth-O-Meter, Politifact Ohio rates his claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D4C600>],/factchecks/2011/may/27/armond-budish/state-rep-armond-budish-says-gop-approved-changes-/
"['Georgia', 'Energy', 'Eric Cantor']","
U.S. is the king of coal, Cantor says
","
American politicians, it seems, love to talk about Saudi Arabia.

During the 2010 election season in Georgia, several Democrats and Republicans separately proclaimed that the Peach State was ""the Saudi Arabia of pine trees."" We looked at that claim in July 2010 and rated it as Barely True.

One of the latest comparisons to that oil-rich Middle East nation came from House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, one of the most powerful politicians in Washington.

Cantor, a Republican congressman from Virginia, made a stop at the Atlanta Press Club last week during a two-day visit to Georgia. During the question-and-answer part of the program, Cantor took several verbal swipes at President Barack Obama, a Democrat. The criticism included that Obama hasn’t done enough to promote more sources of energy, specifically coal, as motorists fume over high gas prices.

""We are the Saudi Arabia of coal,"" Cantor said.

More than 90 percent of U.S. coal production goes to generate electricity in the United States, according to the National Mining Association. Cantor explained his point about coal.

""We ought to be able to figure out a way to use that resource so that we can continue to compete,"" he said.

We wondered in what way was Cantor attempting to make the comparison to Saudi Arabia. John Murray, Cantor’s deputy chief of staff, said the congressman was attempting to be ""illustrative.""

Murray added more in an email.

""Coal is an abundant domestic resource that remains critical to meeting our country's energy needs,"" Murray said.""While we wait for the administration to present a realistic national energy strategy, we need to harness our existing assets -- like coal -- to generate the power required by American businesses and families.""

So let’s look closer at this comparison between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. Even Obama has repeated the phrase, during a 2009 television interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Co.

Saudi Arabia exports more oil than any nation in the world, 8.7 million barrels a day, according to one U.S. government estimate. Saudi Arabia also has a larger oil reserve than any other country, the U.S. says. The U.S., by the way, ranks 13th and 14th, respectively, in those categories.

Saudi Arabia, the numbers show, is the king of oil exports and reserves.

Now, is the U.S. the king of coal?

The U.S. leads the world in the amount of coal in its reserves, according to data kept by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Russia was second, but about 50 percent behind the U.S., the EIA data show. But is the former Cold War foe playing coy with its numbers? Some experts believe Russia and China are not releasing the complete estimates of their coal reserves.

The U.S. is producing and exporting less coal than some other nations.

The U.S. produced nearly 1.1 billion short tons of coal in 2009, second to China, according to the most recent data available from the EIA. A short ton of coal equals 2,000 pounds. America’s annual coal production has been about the same since 2000. China, whose economy has boomed during the past decade, has increased its coal production from nearly 1.3 billion short tons in 2000 to nearly 3.4 billion short tons in 2009, EIA data show.

For eight of the past 10 years, the United States has exported an average of 50 million short tons of coal each year. The U.S. currently exports less coal than Australia, Colombia, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa.

The U.S. has the world’s most comprehensive and strongest coal mining regulations, the National Mining Association says. Hal Quinn, the association’s president, told a congressional committee Tuesday that the federal government has placed ""high hurdles"" on the industry’s efforts to access land where much of the nation’s coal reserves are held. The association represents about 325 corporations in the mining industry.

Others question how minable those reserves are. West Virginia University law school professor Patrick McGinley said much of America’s coal is in places that are more difficult to mine. He noted recent research that concludes that the world’s coal production (its highest quality and reasonably minable coal) will reach its peak this year.

""It’s not realistic to equate the coal reserves in the United States with the oil reserves in Saudi Arabia,"" said McGinley, who served on a panel that investigated the coal mine explosion in West Virginia that killed 29 people in April 2010.

Cantor’s argument is supported by data that show the United States currently has the world’s largest coal reserve. America has fallen far behind China in terms of coal production, and the United States is behind several other nations in exporting coal. The congressman’s statement leaves out some details concerning America’s standing in coal.

Since the United States is still the Saudi Arabia of coal reserves, we rate Cantor’s claim as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096671880>],/factchecks/2011/may/27/eric-cantor/us-king-coal-cantor-says/
"['Education', 'Health Care', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Joe Straus']","
Speaker Straus says state budget deal ""funds nursing homes, our public schools and universities, and provides financial aid for college students""
","
Joe Straus, the Texas House speaker, recently joined Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in announcing a compromise between House and Senate negotiators on the 2012-13 state budget.

Straus elaborated in a May 20 press release: ""The agreement that we reached with the Senate today funds nursing homes, our public schools and universities, and provides financial aid for college students while keeping substantial revenue in reserves and avoiding any new taxes.""

Check on keeping money in reserve and not raising taxes. But is it fiscally defensible to crow about funding education and nursing homes in this tight budget cycle?

To our inquiry, Straus spokeswoman Tracy Young pointed out that specific numbers wouldn’t be available until the inked deal was published as the proposed budget. In the meantime, we turned to news reports on the budget deal, which was reached months after the state comptroller’s revenue forecast for 2012-13 left lawmakers grappling with a projected shortfall of more than $20 billion to maintain existing spending or services.

First, let’s look at the public schools.

The Austin American-Statesman noted May 24 that the agreement gives public school districts $4 billion less in 2012-13 than they would get under current law. Lynn Moak, a lobbyist whose clients include an alliance of large school districts, told us it allocates about $37 billion to districts -- ""less money for schools than schools were counting on under the normal school formula process."" But Moak said districts will be ""a lot better off"" than they would have been under the first House-approved budget, which would have given the schools at least $7.8 billion less than they stood to draw under existing formulas.

And state support for higher education? Overall, the agreement cuts that funding about 10 percent in 2012-13, the Dallas Morning News reported May 23. Specifics include: a 25 percent reduction in a fund to help universities reach elite status as research institutions; a 5 percent cut in general academic funding formulas and a 10 percent cut in funding for the state’s nine health science centers, the newspaper said.

Also, the number of Texas college students getting state-backed scholarships will drop by 41,000 from the 153,738 students now getting that aid, the News reported. That’s a 25 percent hit. That includes 29,000 fewer poor and lower-midde-income students who will receive TEXAS Grants, intended for poor and lower-middle-income children.

Then again, the budget deal protects formula funding and scholarships at community colleges, state Rep. Dan Branch, R-Dallas told the Morning News.

We ran the higher education numbers by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, whose spokesman, Dominic Chavez, said state aid to higher ed is actually slated to drop about 8 percent in 2012-13. He said all state-backed college financial aid will decrease 23 percent, with 43,258 fewer students benefiting.

To gauge funding for nursing homes, we contacted the Texas Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, which advocates at the Capitol for about 100 nonprofit nursing homes. Spokesman David Thomason said the budget agreement maintains an already-imposed 3 percent reduction in the rate paid for serving nursing-home residents on Medicaid -- more than erasing the 2.7 percent rate increase approved by the 2009 Legislature.

Thomason said the association doesn’t expect homes to close due to the lowered Medicaid rate, but he predicted staffing reductions and fewer nursing-home slots available to Texans on Medicaid.

Summing up, public schools stand to field $4 billion less in 2012-13 than they would have gotten under current law. Higher education, except for community colleges, is likewise due to sustain funding cuts plus a drop in state-supported scholarships. Nursing homes are left with lower rates than they had after the 2009 legislative session.

Straus is correct the agreed-upon budget ""funds"" these items, but his statement fails to acknowledge the funding is mostly at lower levels than before. That’s vital missing context. 
We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BF9740>],/factchecks/2011/may/27/joe-straus/speaker-straus-says-state-budget-deal-funds-nursin/

CEO says Chrysler Group is now square with the American taxpayer
","
In an announcement reminiscent of one made by GM around this time last year, Chrysler Group LLC boasted this week that it had paid back money lent to it by the American government, with interest, six years ahead of schedule.

President Barack Obama, who is expected to highlight the milestone in a visit to a Toledo, Ohio, Chrysler plant on June 3, called the repayment ""a significant milestone for the turnaround of Chrysler and the countless communities and families who rely on the American auto industry."" He and other Democrats adopted an I-told-you-so stance, with some Democrats taking the opportunity to remind the public that many Republicans opposed the auto bailouts.

In a press release from Chrysler Group LLC announcing the loan repayment, the company's Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne stated, ""Less than two years ago, we made a commitment to repay the U.S. and Canadian taxpayers in full, and today we made good on that promise.""

For this item, we're going to focus on whether the company repaid U.S. taxpayers. 
Chrysler Group LLC repaid $5.1 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) loans and formally terminated its ability to draw from a remaining $2.1 billion line of credit extended through TARP. Together with interest and fees, Chrysler Group has now paid $6.5 billion to the U.S. Treasury. It borrowed $5.1 billion from the U.S. government when it began operations under new ownership in June 2009. In addition, the U.S. Treasury still holds a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler Group.

So is Chrysler now really square with the American taxpayer?

The press release doesn't mention it, but there's more to the government's investment in Chrysler than the loans to Chrysler Group LLC.

In its own press release about Chrysler's loan repayment, the U.S. Department of Treasury lays out a more complete picture of taxpayer support of Chrysler:

""Treasury committed a total of $12.5 billion to Chrysler under TARP’s Automotive Industry Financing Program (AIFP),"" the release states. ""With today’s transaction, Chrysler has returned more than $10.6 billion of that amount to taxpayers through principal repayments, interest, and cancelled commitments.  Treasury continues to hold a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler. As previously stated, however, Treasury is unlikely to fully recover its remaining outstanding investment of $1.9 billion in Chrysler.""

In an interview with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on May 24, 2011, Ron Bloom, assistant to President Obama in charge of manufacturing policy, broke it down more plainly:

""Today, Chrysler is reducing their obligation to the U.S. taxpayer by $8 billion. They have previously provided us with $2.6 billion of funds. So, that $10.6 (billion) stacks up against $8.5 billion that the president invested in Chrysler and $4 billion from the prior administration. So, that's over 100 percent of all monies that this administration invested and about 85 percent of the total invested funds by the United States government.""

So how can the Chrysler Group LLC claim to have squared its obligation to the American taxpayers when only 85 percent of the taxpayers' investment in Chrysler has been recouped?

Notice how we keep writing Chrysler Group LLC. There's a reason for that. That's the ""new"" Chrysler company that emerged from bankruptcy in 2009.

We'll let Gualberto Ranieri, head of communications for the Chrysler Group LLC, explain.

Ranieri likened the generic use of the word ""Chrysler"" to a fruit salad, which is made up of lots of different fruits: apples, strawberries, blueberries...you get the idea. When you talk about Chrysler, there's not just one company. There's the ""old Chrysler,"" the company that was liquidated in bankruptcy. There's the ""new"" Chrysler, aka Chrysler Group LLC, the newly formed company that purchased most of the assets of Old Chrysler in a bankruptcy sale. There's also the financing firms Chrysler Financial and GMAC.

""We are not responsible for the old Chrysler,"" Ranieri said. ""We are not responsible for Chrysler Financial. I am not responsible for my brother's loans, even though we have the same last name.""

Chrysler Group CEO Marchionne can only speak for the new company, Ranieri said, and the government money extended to Chrysler Group has been fully repaid, with interest.

That's technically true, Edward Niedermeyer, editor-in-chief of The Truth About Cars website wrote this week. ""It does, however, fail to account (again) for the $1.9 billion Debtor-in-Possession 'loan' which financed Chrysler during bankruptcy and was conveniently left to die with the remains of 'Old Chrysler.' Nor does it account for the $1.5 billion loaned to Chrysler’s suppliers to keep them afloat amidst the bailout chaos.""

Chrysler and its ""political bedfellows"" should be ""forgiven for a little cheering,"" Niedermeyer wrote. The loan repayment is a positive sign of hope for a once seemingly doomed company.

""It’s just that taxpayers still deserve a full and transparent accounting of 'every penny' (to borrow a phrase) that actually went into Chrysler, not just 'loans made in the last two years' or 'loans made by the Obama Administration' or other weasel-wordings employed to make the bailout seem more successful than it is,"" Niedermeyer wrote. ""Though bailout supporters will doubtless argue that 'it doesn’t matter' because Chrysler is alive today and 'that’s what matters,' this doesn’t justify a lack of transparency. In fact, if the bailout was successful because GM and Chrysler survived, that’s all the more reason to not fear the truth about what the bailout actually cost.""

James Gattuso, a senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said there was nearly $2 billion in taxpayer money that ""went down with the ship with the old shell"" of Chrysler. Technically, he said, Chrysler Group LLC is a different company. But from a taxpayers' perspective, there's little distinction.

""If the taxpayers were a bank, they wouldn't stay in business very long,"" he said. ""The taxpayers took a loss, or they are still in the red at least.""

Now, the U.S. Treasury still owns a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler Group. That has an undetermined value, as the company has not yet gone public. But as the Treasury itself acknowledged, ""Treasury is unlikely to fully recover its remaining outstanding investment of $1.9 billion in Chrysler.""

We asked Lawrence J. White, a professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University what he made of Marchionne's statement.

""This certainly appears to be another instance of careful language, where all of Chrysler's statement is focused on loans to Chrysler but not the other Treasury investments,"" White said.  ""Yes, this appears to be an incomplete statement.""

As we noted earlier, the statements made by Marchionne were similar to those made by General Motors CEO Ed Whitacre last year. But the situations are different. For one, the government took a much larger equity stake in GM. For more details, see our fact-check related to Whitacre's claims last year.

Again, there may be cause for celebratory comments from Chrysler. But Marchionne's statement, while technically accurate, doesn't tell the full story. Yes, Chrysler Group LLC has fully repaid the loans made to it two years ago. But that's not the full measure of the American taxpayers' investments to try to save Chrysler, including $2 billion to ""old"" Chrysler that was wiped out in bankruptcy. We doubt taxpayers care much about the distinctions in corporate titles. The government has now gotten most of its money back, but not all of it. Not yet anyway. We rate the claim Half True. 
UPDATE: The original version of this article mentioned Canadian taxpayers in the quotation. But since we are focusing on U.S, contributions, the reference to Canada was removed from the statement.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D4C8C0>],/factchecks/2011/may/26/sergio-marchionne/ceo-says-chrysler-group-now-square-american-taxpay/

Tim Pawlenty eliminated health insurance for 33,000 in Minnesota, DNC says
","
An ad from the Democratic Party suggests Tim Pawlenty doesn’t have any good reason for running for president. The text of the ad asks, ""Why is Tim Pawlenty running for president? Is it his track record as governor?"" while really annoying oompa music plays in the background. 
The ad then shows what looks like local news coverage from 2009. ""Gov. Pawlenty eliminated the program that provides health care to 33,000 low-income residents,"" says a narrator. ""(The) governor has systematically been cutting programs to the core since he took office."" Another person says, ""All of a sudden we’re going to have 35,000 people without health insurance."" 
The ad makes some other claims, too. It said that Pawlenty has flip-flopped on his position on cap and trade (accurate; we gave him a Full Flop for that) and that he’s said he doesn’t know why he’s running for president (inaccurate, according to FactCheck.org). 
Here, we wanted to focus on the claim that Pawlenty eliminated a health insurance program for approximately 33,000 low-income people in 2009. 
We asked the Democratic National Committee and the Tim Pawlenty campaign for responses on this, and didn’t hear back from either one. 
But journalists in Minnesota thoroughly covered the big political fight over a health care program that covered about 33,000 people back in 2009. We found that Pawlenty ultimately reduced the size of the health program and limited benefits, but care wasn’t entirely eliminated. 
The program was called General Assistance Medical Care, and it was a health plan for very low-income adults who were not eligible for the federal Medicaid program. (At that time, Medicaid was only open to people who were both low income and elderly, disabled, young or pregnant.) 
Minnesota needed to trim its budget in 2009, and Pawlenty proposed changing the program to save money. The changes would limit benefits and discourage emergency room visits by transferring some, but not all, of the beneficiaries to a program called MinnesotaCare, which required premiums. Advocates for the poor and hospital officials said the cuts would be devastating. 
Pawlenty used his line-item veto to eliminate funding for the old program in May 2009, but he continued to negotiate with the Democratic-controlled legislature for the rest of the year and into 2010. ""We are open to considering health care reforms during the 2010 session, but they need to be financially responsible,"" Pawlenty spokesman Brian McClung said on Jan. 13, 2010. 
By February, though, Pawlenty vetoed General Assistance Medical Care again, which led to a public outcry and another round of negotiations with the Democratic-controlled legislature. In April, a compromise was reached to continue the program through May and then begin scaling it back, forcing beneficiaries to get care through hospitals or the hospitals’ approved clinics. The compromise reduced funding from an estimated  $400 million to $132 million for the year, according to the Minneapolis-based Star Tribune. 
The compromise itself wasn’t without problems. Pawlenty’s administration had to negotiate with hospitals on limits for how many beneficiaries each hospital had to accept. 
As a footnote, the program changed yet again once Pawlenty left office. Pawlenty was succeeded by a Democrat, Mark Dayton, who campaigned on using the federal health care law of 2010 to expand the Medicaid program in Minnesota. Signing an executive order to do so was one of Dayton’s first acts as governor, which moved the General Assistance Medical Care program into Medicaid. 
The ad from the Democrats says that Pawlenty eliminated a health care program for 33,000 to 35,000 people. He did veto the program, but then he negotiated a change to lower costs by reducing benefits. So we rate the ad’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809772AAC0>],/factchecks/2011/may/26/democratic-national-committee/tim-pawlenty-eliminated-health-insurance-33000-min/
"['Voting Record', 'Florida', 'Jeff Brandes']","
St. Petersburg Republican says he sometimes bucked GOP during 2011 legislative session
","
Members of the Suncoast Tiger Bay Club are known for asking tough, pointed and sometimes over-the-top questions of the politicians who speak at their regular luncheon meeting.

The May 13, 2011, event -- which was broadcast on WEDU's ""Florida This Week"" program -- was no exception.

We'll cut to the chase. A questioner asked first-term state Rep. Jeff Brandes, a Republican representing District 52 in Pinellas County, if he was a fraud.

""When you ran for office, if I recall correctly, you said, 'Now when I get elected, I'm gonna really take that Legislature to the woodshed,' "" a man named Thomas Dunn said to Brandes. ""But when you got elected, somehow you lost your backbone and you became a lackey if not a lapdog for the speaker. So my question is, when you ran for office, were you a fraud?""

Brandes, who ran a campaign commercial vowing to take Tallahassee ""to the woodshed,"" sat back in his chair and chuckled.

""That's an interesting question,"" he started in response. ""If you'll go back and watch that commercial, and read it line by line, what you'll see what I said is, for those that want to increase taxes or increase government regulation, we're going to take them to the woodshed. That was the exact line. I know and understand everybody wants me to take everybody to the woodshed, and sometimes it's probably appropriate.""

He continued: ""The reality is, I think I stood up on a number of issues against the speaker and against the governor. I've gotten a phone call from the Governor's Office saying why don't you think welfare recipients should be drug-tested. I believe it's a violation of people's privacy to do that. And I stood up and did that (voted against that). So I think you'll find I have a lot of votes where I was the voice in the Legislature against something. Sometimes I was the only 'no' vote on the entire board. That takes a little bit of courage. So to say I have no courage, no backbone, is, I think, a little disingenuous.""

Brandes repeatedly used the woodshed imagery during the campaign because he used to be in the lumber business -- his family once owned Cox Lumber. He said in the television ad that ""high taxes and over-regulation have got to stop so jobs can return. If Tallahassee gets in the way, we're taking them to the woodshed."" And at his election night victory party after defeating incumbent state Rep. Bill Heller, he signed blocks of wood.

Some Democrats, and apparently Dunn, took the line to mean that Brandes would take Tallahassee to the woodshed on every issue.

While that may be a stretch, Brandes did defend his record as being an independent voice in the Legislature in his response. So we decided to check his record from the 2011 legislative session.

Turns out, there are examples where Brandes bucked the Republican leadership, and even the entire Florida House of Representatives.

Brandes was the lone person in the Legislature to vote against HB 949, a bill that added some licensing requirements for pest control businesses. The bill passed the House 116-1 and the Senate 38-0. Brandes' legislative aide, Nick Hansen, said Brandes voted against the bill because it included additional regulations.

Brandes also was the lone ""no"" vote on SB 650, which allows a mobile home park homeowners association a chance to buy its park outright if the owner is considering changing its land use. The bill passed the House 114-1 and the Senate 39-0.

And he opposed the majority of Republicans on several other issues:

HB 88: Brandes was one of two Republicans to oppose a bill that put restrictions on the amount of severance pay public employees can receive. The bill passed both chambers.

SB 330: Brandes was one of four members of the Legislature and the only Republican to vote against a bill that makes it an election code violation for candidates to falsely say they served in the U.S. military. (Brandes is a former officer in the U.S. Army Reserves who served in the most recent Iraq war.) The bill passed both chambers.

HB 661: Brandes was one of four Republicans to oppose a bill that would cap damages in wrongful death cases at nursing homes at $250,000. The bill passed the House but failed in the Senate.

An amendment to HB 733: Brandes was the only Republican to join Democrats in supporting an amendment that would have lengthened an August sales tax holiday. (Two other Republicans initially voted with Brandes, but later changed their vote.) The bill did not pass.

And as he said at Tiger Bay, Brandes was one of two House Republicans to vote against HB 353, which requires cash welfare recipients to first pass a drug test. Brandes spoke on the House floor that the measure violated people's privacy rights. The bill passed both chambers.

Now, Brandes didn't always buck his own party. In fact, he was in lockstep on most of its highest priorities.

He voted for GOP bills that prohibit public employees unions from collecting dues through automatic payroll deductions (which ultimately failed), restrict or limit abortions (passed), loosen the state's growth management laws (passed), change election law (passed), and to ask voters to approve a constitutional amendment creating two Supreme Courts (failed). He also voted for the budget.

But in this fact-check, we're judging his words. Brandes said: ""I think you'll find I have a lot of votes where I was the voice in the Legislature against something. Sometimes I was the only 'no' vote on the entire board."" Measuring ""a lot"" can be subjective, but Brandes is right that on two occasions he was the only ""no"" vote in the Legislature. In other cases, he bucked his party and stood with Democrats.

We don't know if that adds up to taking them to the woodshed or not. But we do know it makes his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097731340>],/factchecks/2011/may/26/jeff-brandes/st-petersburg-republican-says-he-bucked-gop-during/

Oklahoma Rep. Mullin says average family of 4 would save $1,182 in taxes
","Republicans promised that their tax overhaul would save money for the middle class, and Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., was quick to make the case that it did. ""I’m working alongside the White House and other members in the House to lessen the tax burden that currently weighs on so many Oklahomans,"" Mullin posted on his congressional blog. ""Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the average American family of four will receive a $1,182 tax cut.  Imagine what you could do with $1,182 more in your pocket!"" Mullin's talking point has been popular among House Republicans trying to sell the tax plan. In the past week, we've heard House Speaker Paul Ryan and a Georgia congressman tout the same figure. In each case, they overstated the impact of the tax cut. Mullin did, too, but less so. Here's what you need to know. The figure comes from the House Ways and Means Committee, which wrote the tax bill. That committee calculated several scenarios for how the proposal’s changes could affect different types of taxpayers. The key elements in the committee's calculation involve tax brackets, the standard deduction and the child tax credit. Currently, there are seven brackets; these would be consolidated into four -- 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent, and 39.6 percent. In the meantime, the standard deduction would be raised from $12,000 to $24,000. And the child tax credit will be increased from $1,000 to $1,600, bolstered by a new $300 credit for parents and other dependents. The example Mullin highlighted refers to a ""family of four making $59,000 per year."" Here’s the scenario outlined in the House’s fact sheet, using the fictional example of ""Steve and Melinda"" with two middle school-aged children: ""As a result of lower tax rates, a significantly larger standard deduction, and an enhanced Child Tax Credit and Family Flexibility Credit, Steve and Melinda will pay over $1,182 less in taxes than last year, reducing their total tax bill from $1,582 to only $400. ""That’s more money they can use for whatever is important to them, whether it’s paying bills, purchasing a new refrigerator, or putting away savings for the future."" The Ways and Means Committee said they chose a household income of $59,000 because it’s the median household income nationally. (Mullin talked about families and families are not identical to households, but in Oklahoma, the median family income is about $58,000, so the distinction makes little difference in his state.) For that amount of income, a family today would get $12,700 from the standard deduction, $16,200 in personal exemptions, leaving $30,100 in taxable income. Of that, $18,650 would be taxed at 10 percent and $11,450 would be taxed at 15 percent, meaning the preliminary tax liability would be $3,582.50. That would be adjusted with $2,000 in child tax credits, producing a final tax liability of $1,582.50. Under the new tax bill, the family would take a larger $24,000 standard deduction (the proposal eliminates personal exemptions), leaving $35,000 in taxable income. At the 12 percent rate, that would mean $4,200 in preliminary liability. This would be offset by $3,200 in child tax credits and $600 in family credits, leaving a final tax liability of $400. That’s a $1,182.50 tax cut. So the number adds up, but there are some caveats that show it might not work out this way for all families like Steve and Melinda’s. The GOP bill eliminates or shrinks a number of widely used itemized deductions, and those factors aren’t taken into account in the figure House estimate. The deductions eliminated or pared back in the bill include the mortgage interest deduction (for future mortgages, it would be capped at half its previous maximum); the state and local tax deduction (only $10,000 in property tax deductions would be allowed); the medical expense deduction; the casualty loss deduction; and the student loan interest deduction. For example, nearly 9 million people with high medical bills deduct them on the taxes. Exchanging these changes for a higher standard deduction may benefit many taxpayers, particularly those who choose not to itemize today. But some taxpayers who depend on these itemized deductions today may end up worse off if the bill is passed as is, even with the higher standard deduction. For this type of taxpayer, the loss of even one of those deductions could conceivably wipe out that $1,182 gain for certain types of families. David Kamin, a tax and budget specialist at the New York University law school, told us that the bill has some wrinkles that can turn a tax cut into a tax hike. Kamin cited a combination of factors, including the sunsetting of the $300 per parent tax credit; the lack of inflation adjustments for the child tax credit, which effectively replace personal exemptions that were indexed to inflation; and the new use of an inflation adjustment measure known as chained CPI, which grows more slowly than the yardstick in current use. According to Kamin’s calculations, the initial tax cut for the family making $59,000 becomes about a $450 tax increase by 2024 compared to the status quo. Here’s the graph he put together:  Mullin didn’t promise that the initial tax cut would last, as other Republicans have.  After Mullin made his statement, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation analyzed the tax plan using a different approach. The committee found that while tax collections from people making under $40,000 would fall at first, they would go up in 2023. The groups that would do the best under the plan would be people making between $100,000 and $200,000, and those making over $1 million a year. Mullin said that the average American family of four would get a tax cut of $1,182. The number is a reasonable estimate, based on certain assumptions. What might not be obvious is that families who take advantage of deductions today might see their taxes rise. And even those who benefit immediately might see those gains turn into losses after 2023. So if you think this tax cut would be ongoing, or every year, you'd be wrong. Unlike his colleagues, however, Mullin didn’t outright promise that the initial tax cut would last for more than one year. Mullin's statement therefore is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097727F40>],/factchecks/2017/nov/07/markwayne-mullin/oklahoma-rep-mullin-says-average-family-would-save/

Alyssa Milano: no background checks in Texas for long gun sales. Is that true?
","Actress Alyssa Milano drew attention to gun background checks after a shooting at a Texas church left at least 26 people dead. ""There are no background checks on long guns (AR15s) in Texas. Thanks for the info @shannonrwatts,"" Milano tweeted on Nov. 5, crediting for the information Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, an organization seeking stronger gun laws. There are no background checks on long guns (AR15s) in Texas. Thanks for the info @shannonrwatts.   That means he’s prohibited purchaser, but there’s absolutely no regulation of long guns (AR15s) in Texas. No background check required. https://t.co/H0oqxgEsx9 By mid-day Nov. 6, Milano’s message had been retweeted more than 3,200 times and ""liked"" by more than 7,800 Twitter users. Given the controversial national discourse on gun control, we wanted to know if Milano was right about background checks and long guns in Texas. We found her tweet to be partly accurate: licensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers must conduct a background check for the transfer of all firearms, but private sellers are not required to run such background checks. We reached out to Milano for comment but did not hear back. Law enforcement officials identified 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley as the gunman who killed 26 people and injured 20 others at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Nov. 5. Freeman Martin, a regional director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said at a Nov. 6 press conference that the shooting was not over religious beliefs. The suspect’s mother-in-law attended the church (though not present during the shooting) and had received threatening texts from Kelley. ""There was a domestic situation going on with this family,"" Martin said. Kelley dropped a ""Ruger AR assault-type rifle"" and fled the church, according to Martin. Kelley was found dead in his vehicle after a car chase and crash. Details on the cause of his death are developing. Milano tweeted that in Texas there are no background checks on long guns, such as AR-15-style rifles. (AR-15-style rifles look like military rifles ""but function like other semi-automatic civilian sporting firearms, firing only one round with each pull of the trigger,"" according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation.) Texas does not have a state law requiring any seller to run a background check on purchasers of any gun, said Ari Freilich, a staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. But there is federal law requiring background checks in some cases, she said. ""Federal law requires federally licensed gun dealers, importers, and manufacturers to run background checks before selling firearms of any kind to an unlicensed buyer,"" Freilich said. However, unlicensed, private sellers are not required by federal law to run background checks on individuals purchasing firearms. Many Twitter users pointed out this distinction to Milano. Appearing to have noticed the challenges to her claim, Milano tweeted less than two hours later: ""Background checks aren’t REQUIRED in Texas on long guns. If you buy from Walmart, they’ll do one. If you buy privately they don’t have to."" Background checks aren’t REQUIRED in Texas on long guns. If you buy from Walmart, they’ll do one. If you buy privately they don’t have to. Watts, whom Milano credited for her information, also later specified in tweets that no background checks were required for private sales of long guns. Some states do have restrictions on the private sale of firearms. For instance, in California such sales must be done through a licensed dealer. A study published in January 2017 asked 1,613 adult gun owners where and when they acquired their last firearm, including whether it was purchased, and whether they had either a background check or were asked to show a firearm license or permit. Twenty-two percent said they obtained their gun without a background check. Milano tweeted, ""There are no background checks on long guns (AR15s) in Texas."" Federal law does require background checks when a firearm is sold or transferred by licensed gun dealers, importers, and manufacturers. That includes long guns. But private, unlicensed sellers are not required to conduct background checks under federal or Texas law, even though other states have added requirements to that effect. Milano noted these distinctions in a follow-up tweet, but her original tweet lacked important context. We rate Milano’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2AF480>],/factchecks/2017/nov/06/alyssa-milano/alyssa-milano-no-background-checks-texas-long-gun-/

Fake news: No proof Antifa, communism compelled Texas shooter Devin Kelley
","A fake news story about the killer in a mass shooting at a Texas church said the gunman was an anti-fascist looking to sow chaos in the hope of starting a civil war. The headline on a Nov. 5, 2017, story on ThirdEstateNewsGroup.com read, ""Texas Church shooter was Antifa and wanted to start ‘communist revolution.’ "" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. The story appeared the same day 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley killed at least 26 people in First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. It said Kelley was ""an Antifa member who vowed to start a civil war by ‘targeting white conservative churches’ and causing anarchy in the United States."" The post also said he ""was one of two shooters in the church, according to eyewitnesses, who also report Kelley carried an Antifa flag and told the churchgoers ‘this is a communist revolution’ before unloading on the congregation, reloading several times."" None of those details have been confirmed by law enforcement agencies, or reported by reputable media outlets. Authorities said their initial investigation showed the attack was likely motivated by a family dispute, and not a broader movement. The story was an incomplete copy of a longer post on fake news website YourNewsWire.com, which attributed many of its assertions to Kelley’s alleged Facebook profile. ""Devin Kelley’s Facebook page stated that he was an atheist and his interests included ‘Civil and social rights’ and ‘Civil rights’ as well as endorsements for local Texan Democratic political candidates. His page also featured photos of several high powered weapons,"" the post read. YourNewsWire.com claimed that they had Facebook images of Kelley and an AR-15-style rifle, although there was no indication it was the Ruger AR-556 rifle police have reported finding at the scene. We could not find a Facebook profile for Kelley, so we could not independently verify the content of his alleged profile. The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times, among others, reported that the profile with those photos had been taken down shortly after the shooting. The top of the YourNewsWire.com story contained the two images, plus a third of an Antifa flag. Antifa United debunked the use of the flag image in a Facebook post. ""Let's go ahead and lay this to rest right now. The far-right (badly) put together a collage of images/mock up of a FB profile and are claiming the Texas shooter uploaded a picture of his antifa flag. How do we know its fake?"" the group posted on Nov. 5. ""That's OUR picture. Pulled from our shop website when we had that flag design in stock. The person holding it in the picture is me.

We attempted to contact Baxter Dmitry, who is listed as the author on the post, to confirm the sources of these details, but did not get a reply. The idea that Kelley was an antifa member targeting conservatives was a popular talking point among the so-called alt-right following the shooting. Other conservative outlets focused on Kelley’s supposed atheism and Facebook ""like"" of CNN.

""This was not racially motivated, it wasn’t over religious beliefs,"" agency spokesman Freeman Martin said in a news conference. ""There was a domestic situation going on within the family and the in-laws."" CNN reported that Kelley killed his wife’s grandmother, Lula White, in the attack. NBC reported he may have been targeting his mother-in-law. ""The suspect’s mother-in-law attended this church,"" Freeman said. ""We know that … she had received threatening texts from him."" He declined to elaborate, saying the investigation was ongoing. A fake news post said Kelley was Antifa and wanted to start a ""communist revolution."" The story originally came from YourNewsWire.com, a website we know to post articles full of bogus details. Law enforcement has not reported the sensational particulars in the site’s story.

Georgia congressman says GOP tax bill will save typical family $1,182. Will it?
","House Republicans have touted their tax bill as a plus for typical American families. In a constituent email forwarded to us by a reader, Georgia Rep. Drew Ferguson wrote, ""This week the House released our tax reform legislation to help American families and level the playing field for the American worker. With this plan, the average family of four earning median income ($59,000/year) will receive an additional $1,182 in their pocket every year. Who wouldn't want American families to have more money in their pockets?""   The statement is exaggerating how long the average family of four will enjoy those tax savings. Ferguson’s office said that he had been citing comment from House Speaker Paul Ryan, whose office told us in a related check that the speaker had been referring to a House Ways and Means Committee analysis. That analysis calculated several scenarios for how the proposal’s changes could affect different types of taxpayers. The key elements of the Ways and Means calculation involved tax brackets, the standard deduction and the child tax credit.

That’s a $1,182.50 tax cut. So Ferguson has some mathematical detail to back up the figure. But that’s not the end of the story. Here are the two clearest caveats. The GOP bill eliminates or shrinks a number of widely used itemized deductions, and those factors aren’t taken into account in the figure Ryan cited. The deductions eliminated or pared back in the bill include the mortgage interest deduction (for future mortgages, it would be capped at half its previous maximum); the state and local tax deduction (only $10,000 in property tax deductions would be allowed); the medical expense deduction; the casualty loss deduction; and the student loan interest deduction. Exchanging these changes for a higher standard deduction may benefit many taxpayers, particularly those who choose not to itemize today. For households earning around $59,000 a year, more taxpayers do take the standard deduction than take itemized deductions -- but a significant minority, about one-third, do itemize. For many itemizing taxpayers, those deductions are important -- and under the tax bill, they’re likely to end up worse off if the bill is passed as is, even with the higher standard deduction. For this type of taxpayer, the loss of even one of those deductions could conceivably wipe out that $1,182 gain for certain types of families. Ferguson’s statement explicitly said that the $1,182 income boost would happen ""every year."" The problem is that the benefits of the tax proposal shrink, slowly but surely, over the next decade for this family. ""The tax cut definitely dissipates over time,"" David Kamin, a tax and budget specialist at the New York University law school, told PolitiFact. Kamin cited a combination of factors, including the sunsetting of the $300 per parent tax credit; the lack of inflation adjustments for the child tax credit, which effectively replace personal exemptions that were indexed to inflation; and the new use of an inflation adjustment measure known as chained CPI, which grows more slowly than the yardstick in current use. According to Kamin’s calculations, the initial tax cut for the family making $59,000 becomes a $500 tax increase by 2024 compared to the status quo. Here’s the graph he put together: The way Ferguson described the cut was actually stronger than Ryan’s tax cut of ""$1,182 a year."" Amy Timmerman, Ferguson’s communications director, said that ""the congressman misspoke last week when he cited Speaker Ryan’s example."" Ferguson said that under the House Republican tax proposal, ""the average family of four earning median income ($59,000/year) will receive an additional $1,182 in their pocket every year."" This is based on a plausible and transparent calculation, but Ferguson glossed over some context. The calculation doesn’t factor in several itemized deductions that would disappear under the proposal and that could have a significant impact on at least some ""typical"" families around that income level. And the statement is misleading when it says the family will save $1,182 ""every year,"" since that’s the case in the first year only; after that, the benefit starts to shrink and eventually turns into a tax hike. We rate the statement Half True. EDITORS' NOTE, Nov. 6, 2017: We updated this story to remove a reference to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center of the tax plan.

Do Joe Manchin and Evan Jenkins support Clinton, cap-and-trade, Planned Parenthood and tax hikes?
","In the West Virginia Republican primary for U.S. Senate, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey accused his opponent, U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins, R-W.Va., of aligning with the Democratic incumbent. ""Jenkins has the same positions on the issues as Joe Manchin: supporting Hillary (Clinton), supporting cap-and-trade, supporting Planned Parenthood, many tax increases,"" Morrisey said in a radio interview on Oct. 12. Does Jenkins, a Republican, align with Manchin, a Democrat, on support for Clinton, cap-and-trade, Planned Parenthood and tax increases? First, it’s important to note that Jenkins has changed his party affiliation multiple times. He was initially registered as a Democrat, switched to Republican, and back to Democrat when he sought a seat in the House of Delegates in Cabell-Wayne County, W.Va., in 1993. He remained a Democrat until July 2013, when he switched back to the Republican Party to successfully challenge U.S. Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va. Manchin, on the other hand, is largely known as a conservative Democrat. We found that Jenkins doesn’t currently support the positions the ad mentioned, and in at least one case, Manchin didn’t either. Support? Manchin Jenkins Hillary Clinton Yes No Planned Parenthood Yes No Cap-and-trade No No Taxes Sometimes No In 2008, Manchin endorsed Barack Obama. He endorsed Clinton in 2016. Manchin even came out in Clinton’s support following her controversial comments that she would ""put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business"" if elected. ""I'm willing to take the flack because I believe in her,"" he said during a May 2016 roundtable. ""I know that's not in her heart, I know I've got two people I can count on, Hillary and Bill."" He took a step back in October 2017, calling her statement ""very harmful and very hard to justify or say."" ""It wouldn't be wise for Hillary to come to West Virginia,"" Manchin said. ""It wouldn't be a good thing for her or for me."" So while he took it down several notches, Manchin did support Clinton for president in 2016. Did Jenkins? Jenkins backed Trump in 2016. The Morrisey campaign said Jenkins supported Clinton in 2008 as evidenced by his attendance of a rally in her support. On July 27, 2007, Jenkins attended an economic policy town hall Clinton hosted at West Virginia State University. ""Any time you have a presidential candidate from any party come to the state, it's a time to rally the troops and energize those involved in the political process,"" Jenkins, then a Democratic state senator, said in the article the Morrisey campaign cited. ""It's important not to miss an opportunity to hear a candidate speak about the issues that matter to the people in this state,"" Jenkins added. The article did not mention Jenkins’ presidential preferences. Jenkins ""simply remarks that it is good for the state, and the civic engagement of its citizenry, when presidential candidates from any party come to West Virginia to talk policy,"" said Andy Sere, a spokesman for Jenkins. Jenkins attended a similar event for Bush in 2004, as a Democrat. ""Anytime you have a president in your hometown, when we have the national spotlight on West Virginia, on Huntington, on Marshall, that's a plus,"" Jenkins had told the Charleston Daily Mail. Morrisey’s campaign also said they believed Jenkins had voted for Clinton in the Democratic primary in 2008 because he had stated he didn’t support Obama but still voted. ""Evan skipped the presidential race on the primary ballot in 2008 because he didn’t support any of the Democratic candidates for president, which is why he voted for McCain in the general election,"" Sere said. ""In 2008 we had everything on the primary ballot, from the presidential primary all the way to county races,"" said Steven Adams, a spokesman for West Virginia Secretary of State’s Office. ""Jenkins certainly could have skipped the presidential race if he wanted to."" With no proof of having voted for Clinton or any public endorsements, we can’t say Jenkins aligns with Manchin on support for Clinton. Does Manchin support cap-and-trade policies? Manchin has campaigned on his opposition to cap-and-trade, appearing in a 2010 campaign ad for the U.S. Senate that showed him shooting at the text of the cap-and-trade bill. ""I’ll take dead aim at the cap-and-trade bill,"" he says in the video. But Morrisey’s campaign pointed to the Alternative and Renewable Energy Portfolio Act, a bill Jenkins voted for and Manchin passed as governor in 2009. Manchin came under fire for the act by his opponent in 2010, who called the law ""Obama’s cap-and-trade, West Virginia style."" However, as Factcheck.org pointed out, the act has little to do with the cap-and-trade legislation debated in Washington. Cap-and-trade legislation sets limits on emissions and then lets companies trade emission reduction credits. Energy portfolio standards, on the other hand, require utilities to get a certain share of their energy generation from different sources. This bill represented the latter, calling for 10 percent of the electricity generated by coal plants to come from ""alternative and renewable energy resources"" by 2015, and 25 percent by 2025. A variety of ""advanced coal technology"" processes actually fit under this umbrella, including electricity generated from waste coal and coal gasification and liquefaction. Bill Raney, the president of the West Virginia Coal Association, which represents most of the coal producers in the state and endorsed Manchin for Senate, found no issue with the law. When the law was repealed in 2015, the Charleston Gazette pointed out it had done little to hurt the coal industry or promote alternatives like wind energy or solar power. Morrisey’s campaign also used as evidence that in 1997, Jenkins sponsored HB 2476, a bill to create an emissions banking and trading program to incentivize better air quality. Patrick McGinley and James Van Nostrand, two environmental law experts at West Virginia University familiar with the law, disagreed. The 1997 bill lacks a cap on emissions, the critical feature of cap-and-trade legislation that generates scarcity in emission allowances, driving the market for trading emission credits. Manchin has gotten flack recently for his stance on Planned Parenthood, as he appeared in photos with constituents carrying both pro- and anti-Planned Parenthood signs. Manchin has voted both for and against defunding the group. Manchin says he’s personally anti-abortion but supports federal funding for Planned Parenthood contingent on the Hyde Amendment, which blocks federal funding for most abortion services. Jenkins, on the other side, has cast repeated votes to defund Planned Parenthood, including the ""No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act,"" ""Defund Planned Parenthood Act"" and the ""Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act,"" among others. The Morrisey campaign’s evidence of Jenkins’ support for Planned Parenthood was a 2006 Project Vote Smart issue survey on abortion where Jenkins did not indicate as a principle he supported prohibiting public funding of abortions and to organizations that advocate or perform abortions. ""Jenkins had an opportunity to say he did not support the taxpayer funding for abortion, just like he did with other abortion related policies – but he did not,"" said Nachama Soloveichik, a spokeswoman for Morrisey. The Jenkins campaign called the attack ""bogus,"" noting that the Project Vote Smart website itself said that a lack of response did not indicate opposition to a policy. Jenkins did not respond to the most recent survey.

Morrisey’s campaign said Manchin had voted for higher taxes during his Senate tenure. Manchin’s campaign declined to comment. We found that in 2012, Manchin voted for the ""Buffett Rule,"" which would have imposed a minimum effective tax rate for high-income taxpayers. He also supported Bowles-Simpson, an attempt to balance the budget that raises taxes. The Morrisey campaign couldn't point us to any federal tax increases that Jenkins had voted for while in Congress. Morrisey’s campaign instead pointed to multiple votes against local tax cuts, for example, cuts to hotel taxes or ending fees on such things as real estate transfers or license renewals. Outside those categories, they found up-votes on a tax on cigarettes and on waste coal production -- but little else to show the ""many tax increases"" Morrisey described in the radio interview. Morrisey said ""Jenkins has the same positions on the issues as Joe Manchin: supporting Hillary (Clinton), supporting cap-and-trade, supporting Planned Parenthood, many tax increases."" We found that Jenkins doesn’t support any of the positions the ad mentioned, and in at least one case, Manchin didn’t either. Manchin supported Clinton in 2016, but besides attending a policy town hall Clinton hosted, we found no evidence Jenkins supported her as a candidate in 2008. Unlike the ad suggests, Manchin is against cap-and-trade legislation, even taking aim at the text of the cap-and-trade bill in a campaign video. Experts agreed the 2007 West Virginia bill Manchin and Jenkins supported was not in line with Obama’s proposed cap-and-trade legislation, nor was the 1997 bill Jenkins co-sponsored. Manchin supports Planned Parenthood legislation as long as it doesn’t fund abortions, whereas Jenkins has repeatedly voted against funding the group. Finally, we found no evidence of ""many tax increases"" by either Manchin or Jenkins, although Manchin supported two proposals that would have increased taxes.

No, the Texas church shooter was not on the DNC payroll. That’s fake news.
","Fake news bloggers have seized on the mass shooting at a Texas church, which killed 26 and injured 20 others, to spread disinformation about the shooter’s identity and motive.

""There was a domestic situation going on with this family. The suspect's mother-in-law attended this church. We know that she had received threatening texts from him,"" Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety told reporters in a Nov. 6 press conference.

GOP Sen. David Perdue says diversity visa lottery 'plagued by fraud'
","Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., repeated President Donald Trump’s criticism of the diversity visa program, claiming that the program is ""plagued by fraud."" An Oct. 31 terrorist attack in New York City resulted in eight deaths and about a dozen injuries. Trump said the suspect came to the United States through the diversity visa program and called for its termination. ""[email protected] is right, the Diversity Visa Lottery is a problem and is plagued by fraud. The RAISE Act would eliminate it. #gapol,"" Perdue tweeted Nov. 1. .@realDonaldTrump is right, the Diversity Visa Lottery is a problem and is plagued by fraud. The RAISE Act would eliminate it. #gapol pic.twitter.com/7WdZVaTosu Perdue co-sponsored the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act, seeking to reduce legal immigration to the United States and to eliminate the diversity visa program, which allows up to 50,000 immigrants per year. We wanted to know the accuracy of Perdue’s fraud claim and found that government reports and officials have identified fraud as an issue in the program. The State Department said it did not have data to determine how widespread the problem is, and experts told us they were unaware of quantitative estimates. The diversity visa program, administered by the State Department, was created in 1990 through a bill signed into law by former President George H. W. Bush. The program is intended to diversify the U.S. immigrant population, granting up to 50,000 visas annually to individuals from countries that in the previous five years had low rates of immigration to the United States. A lottery system that began in 1995 allows individuals to enter for a chance to apply for a visa. Fraud in the diversity visa program has been a concern for years among lawmakers and government officials. Reports of fraud have even led government agencies to post warnings about scammers’ attempt to deceive applicants. But the State Department told us it did not have data on how widespread fraud is in the program, or what percentage of applications or lottery entries per year are believed to be fraudulent. There are ""extensive programs to vigorously prevent and combat U.S. passport and visa fraud"" and the department investigates all fraud allegations, said Noel Clay, State Department spokesman. A 2007 U.S. Government and Accountability report said the program was ""vulnerable to fraud committed by and against (diversity visa) applicants"" and that the State Department had not compiled comprehensive data on detected and suspected fraudulent activity. Consular officers reported that in countries such as Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nepal, Nigeria, and Ukraine, applicants lacked access to computers or were not internet savvy, therefore sought help from ""visa agents"" or ""visa consultants."" Some providers took advantage of applicants by disseminating misleading information, intercepting official correspondence, and charging exorbitant fees for each step in the process, the 2007 report said. In Bangladesh, some agents used their own address on entry forms so that program notification letters would go to them instead of the person in the entry, and in some cases ""held these letters for up to $20,000 in ransom"" or offered to reduce the fee if the selectee entered into a sham marriage and added the spouse to the application, the report said. A September 2013 report from the State Department’s Office of Inspector General said there was a ""pervasive and sophisticated fraud scheme"" affecting the program in Ukraine. Organized fraud rings in Ukraine masquerading as travel agencies buy, steal or obtain from public sources information on Ukrainian citizens and enter their data into the program’s online entry form. The fraud rings contact individuals who win the lottery and demand $15,000 in exchange for a confirmation number sent by the State Department that’s needed to proceed with the visa application. If the person can’t pay, fraud rings seek to enter that person in a sham marriage with someone else who wants to come to the United States and is willing to pay the fraud rings a fee for the pairing, the report said. ""There is no question that fraud is rampant in the diversity visa lottery program,"" said Jessica M. Vaughan, director of policy studies at Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low-immigration levels. Vaughan said there’s ""massive document fraud"" that’s difficult for consular officers to detect — where people apply first and later produce required information, such as education or work experience documentation. Vaughan and Jan C. Ting, a law professor at the Temple University Beasley School of Law in Philadelphia, told us they were unaware of quantitative estimates of the amount of fraud in the program. ""It is very likely that people have obtained diversity visas through fraud and successfully immigrated to the U.S. and become citizens because of their fraud,"" said Ting, who in 2004 testified before a House committee in objection to the program. Charles D. Piot, an anthropologist and professor at Duke University, says there was a lot of gaming of the system when it was first instituted, but technology added to the process now makes it unlikely for a type of fraud where an applicant is substituted by another person. ""It's important to emphasize that today it's impossible for applicants to sell his or her identity, to swap out that identity, because of the biometrics,"" said Piot, who has done research on Togolese who came to the United States via the visa lottery. Perdue said the diversity visa program is ""plagued by fraud."" The State Department did not provide data on how widespread fraud is within the program, but fraud issues have been documented for many years. Some of the fraud involves organized groups entering individuals into the lottery without their consent and then extracting money from them in exchange for a confirmation number needed for the visa application process. Technology helps prevent the type of fraud where a person would take the place of the original applicant. We rate Perdue’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C14D600>],/factchecks/2017/nov/06/david-perdue/gop-sen-david-perdue-says-diversity-visa-lottery-p/

Raleigh mayor: my opponent 'vows to slash' park funding
","Charles Francis has campaigned on the idea that Raleigh leaders aren’t paying enough attention to the city’s neediest. He’s said that Mayor Nancy McFarlane and other council members seem more enthusiastic about big projects, like building a new City Hall or planning Dix Park, than they are about providing more affordable housing or helping poor residents find jobs. This has prompted McFarlane, the three-term incumbent who’s in a runoff against Francis, to defend those projects. The city purchased the 308-acre Dix property from the state in 2014 for $52 million with the goal of transforming it into a destination park that people could walk to from downtown Raleigh. The deal is one of McFarlane’s proudest accomplishments. So perhaps it’s no surprise that she has cast Francis as someone who ""opposed"" the project, which she claimed in a recent debate. A campaign mailer she paid for goes a step further, saying Francis ""vows to slash funding for parks and open space."" Francis denies McFarlane’s claim, which implies that he has promised deep cuts. We caught up with him on the campaign trail on Nov. 4, where he called it a ""flat-out lie."" ""I have never said that I would cut spending,"" Francis said. ""What I’ve said is that park spending needs to be equitable."" So we asked McFarlane’s campaign advisors, Perry Woods and James Sonneman, if they have evidence to support the claim on the mailer. What McFarlane says Woods pointed to Francis’ comments on Aug. 15, when both candidates attended the Raleigh Wake Citizens Association forum at Martin Street Baptist Church. Francis can be heard describing Dix Park as ""tangential"" and saying the city ""can't be distracted by bike lanes and more parks."" ""Charles Francis has said several times that Dix Park is peripheral to the city and that money should be moved away from parks, like Dix, and into affordable housing and transit,"" Woods said. ""That is not supporting Dix Park or the park system in general."" Woods provided a link to a Sept. 14 News & Observer story about the mayoral candidates. Francis is quoted as saying the city has the wrong priorities. ""That’s been the real conflict I’ve had with these pseudo-liberal Democrats,"" Francis said. ""What’s important to them is bike lanes and parks and that kind of thing. What we have in mind is more basic."" He also provided a link to an Oct. 8 N&O story, in which Francis’ position is summarized this way: The city should stop spending so much money on things like parks and downtown revitalization and focus on public transit and social services, such as mental health care. PolitiFact pointed out to Woods and McFarlane's other advisor, James Sonneman, that those examples don’t provide evidence of Francis ""vowing to slash funding"" for parks and open space. ""Of course, no politician will spell out what their positions would do explicitly,"" Sonneman replied. ""It is the same idea as when a politician like (U.S. House Speaker) Paul Ryan discusses entitlement reform, he doesn't explicitly state that he plans to cut medicare benefits, but taking the position that we need to stop spending so much money on a program means that cuts would be involved."" It's one thing to be critical of government spending. But it's another to vow or promise to do something. We decided to review Francis’ statements in news stories, campaign materials and video footage to see what he said about Dix Park and parks funding in general. Did he make any promises? Other Francis statements Most recently, Francis was quoted on his stance on Oct. 28 in a News & Observer story. The writer describes Francis’ belief this way: that the fanfare surrounding Dix Park has distracted the city from attending to more basic services and needs, including smaller parks in Southeast Raleigh. Francis is critical of the city's decision to hire a New York-based firm to design the park instead of a local company. ""Access to housing, transportation, jobs and education — the basic city services — are more important than bike lanes and parks,"" Francis is quoted saying. In a televised debate on Oct. 20, McFarlane accused Francis of opposing Dix Park early in his campaign. Francis responded by saying he supports Dix Park but wants to make the planning process more inclusive. ""I believe in parks. But parks are not as important as good jobs with high pay and access to housing in terms of people’s quality of life."" He continued: ""We need to be concerned not about people who are going to be in Raleigh 50 years from now but about people who are in Raleigh right now and improving their quality of life."" A story by Indyweek quoted Francis when he announced his plan to call for a runoff: He favors the development of the Dix Park, but not to the detriment of other city parks. ""It's not acceptable to put all of our focus on Dix Park and neglect other parks,"" Francis said. A video posted on his campaign website is titled, ""I support Dix Park – and equity for all of Raleigh."" In it, he said he supports the Dix Park planning process but notes that other parks haven’t gotten the same attention and have only received partial funding for upgrades throughout the years. ""Equity requires that we put just as much attention on our other parks as we do on Dix Park,"" he said. ""Even more, the city has to put Dix Park in its proper priority. As nice as it’s going to be to have Dix Park as a thriving central park 50 years from now, Raleigh must right now — not two years from now — increase access to housing, preserve existing affordable housing and build new affordable housing."" In an Indyweek questionnaire, Francis makes no mention of funding for Dix Park or other parks. Our ruling McFarlane’s mailer says Francis ""vows to slash funding for parks and open space."" Francis has certainly been critical of the city’s enthusiasm for Dix Park and bike lanes. But, as far as we can tell, he’s made no promises to cut the parks budget.

Can 8 in 10 people get health coverage for under $75? Not most Americans
","Get America Covered, an organization founded by former health officials under the Obama administration, is running an enthusiastic albeit misleading campaign to get people to sign up for health care. On Nov. 1, the first day of open enrollment, the group released a video on Twitter featuring former President Barack Obama talking about HealthCare.gov, a portal to enroll in the marketplace exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act. ""It only takes a few minutes and the vast majority of people qualify for financial assistance,"" Obama says. ""Eight in 10 people this year can find plans for $75 a month or less."" Can 8 in 10 people get health coverage for $75 a month or less? It depends on who those 10 people are. The statistic only refers to people currently enrolled in HealthCare.gov. That’s not most Americans. Only 3.7 percent of Americans under the age of 65 are enrolled in the marketplace exchanges. So 80 percent of that sliver can find plans for under $75. ""The entire video is about HealthCare.gov, and not off-marketplace plans, which is made clear throughout the video,"" said co-founder Lori Lodes, a former Medicare and Medicaid Services communications director. But that may not be so clear to the average viewer. The bulk of Americans under the age of 65 are getting health care through their employers, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Generally speaking, those people either aren’t permitted or wouldn’t want to shop on the marketplaces. About seven percent of Americans under 65 are purchasing health care individually, on or off the exchanges. But about 6 million Americans don’t bother going through the marketplace because they make too much money to qualify for subsidies. If they, too, were considered, the 8 in 10 figure might look a lot different, according to Chris Sloan, a senior manager at the health care consulting firm Avalere. With subsidies as the biggest incentive to enroll in the marketplace, the HealthCare.gov population is pretty self-selecting. Avalere found that participation in the exchanges declines dramatically as incomes increase and subsidy eligibility decreases. Over 80 percent of eligible individuals with incomes below 150 percent of the federal poverty level enrolled in the exchanges, while only 2 percent of eligible individuals with incomes above 400 percent of the FPL enrolled. (Subsidies are available, with exceptions, to individuals between 100 and 400 percent FPL.) But in the absence of statistics on HealthCare.gov visitors, the 8-in-10 figure is the only data point available to those wondering about their eligibility for low-cost plans within the marketplace. What’s more, the website also helps enroll people who might not have otherwise known they were eligible for other government programs. ""The share of people who use Healthcare.gov that actually end up in some form of coverage that gets assistance if you include Medicaid and CHIP is probably even higher,"" said Matt Buettgens, a senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the left-leaning Urban Institute. The report found that HealthCare.gov enrollees able to pay $75 or less for health insurance is up by 9 percentage points from last year, and 8 percentage points from 2015. That’s in large part an effect of the Trump administration’s decision not to reimburse insurers for cost-sharing reductions. The uncertainty of those reimbursements drove up premiums on the silver plans used to calculate the tax credits enrollees receive, so anyone eligible for a premium tax credit gained access to more funds. Access to $75-or-less plans depends on whether enrollees stay on their current plan. Sixty percent would qualify for plans $75 or less if they continued to get the same coverage as last year, whereas 80 percent would qualify if they switched. That doesn’t necessarily entail a downgrade. Avalere found that people between 100 and 150 percent of FPL qualified for free Bronze plans in 98 percent of counties, while 10 percent qualified for the more generous gold plans for free. Obama said, ""Eight in 10 people this year can find plans for $75 a month or less."" The video was only talking about an average of 80 percent of less than 3.7 percent of the American population, or the people currently enrolled on HealthCare.gov. This is already a highly self-selected group, as participation in the exchanges declines dramatically as subsidy eligibility decreases. It ignores a majority of the American population because they are enrolled elsewhere, and a large portion of those who could but choose not to use the site because they don’t qualify for subsidies. While enrollees' eligibility for plans under $75 has increased by 9 percentage points from last year, the people who qualify for subsidies hasn’t changed.

Donald Trump touts increased coal production
","President Donald Trump has vowed to end what he calls a ""war on coal."" Recently, Trump tweeted some good news for the industry. ""Coal production up 7.8% in past year,"" Trump wrote in his Oct. 31 tweet. ""Down 31.5% last 10 years. #endingwaroncoal."" Attached to the tweet was a Fox News report that had precisely that figure. The stats played across the screen, and the reporter wrapped up with ""the war on coal is over, and good news for coal."" Fox News told us they drew on the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Short-term Energy Outlook report for October. There are actually a couple of numbers there. The one Fox News used was a forecast for 2017. It predicted that coal production would go from 728 million short tons in 2016 up to 785 million in 2017. That amounts to a 7.8 percent rise. Fox News could have gone with a higher number based on actual rather than predicted output. The government report said that in the first nine months of the year, production was 12 percent higher than at the same point the year before. So if anything, Fox News understated the increase. As for the drop over the past 10 years, that might be an understatement, too. The government numbers show a decline closer to 33 percent. There are a few other things to know. Perhaps most important, the government doesn’t expect the increase to continue. The same energy outlook said ""coal production is expected to increase by 8 percent in 2017 and by less than 1 percent in 2018."" That’s in line with a couple of independent assessments. A 2017 report from the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at West Virginia University, focused only on West Virginia coal, anticipated growth in 2017 followed by modest increases until 2020. But ""after 2020, statewide coal production is expected to fall,"" the report said. The forecast is the same at the national level. A Columbia University analysis also anticipated a rise, but its best-case scenario showed a ""modest recovery"" that in the middle of the next decade would level off at 2013 levels. The rise also needs to be seen in historic context. One reason 2017 looked good is that 2016 was particularly bad, as this chart from West Virginia University makes clear: Coal had been been falling for years, as a result of several factors. The market for coal mainly depends on the price of natural gas, foreign demand and, to a lesser extent, the impact of government policy on domestic demand. At the top of the list, coal competes with natural gas as a fuel to produce electricity. Natural gas prices tumbled with a flood of natural gas largely due to technology called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Utility companies went for the cheaper option. Brian Lego, co-author of the West Virginia University study, said that coal producers in the southern part of West Virginia faced another challenge, a collapse in demand in China for the sort of coal used in making steel. ""There was over capacity in global steel production,"" Lego said. ""When the Chinese pulled back on producing that steel, there was less need for metallurgical coal."" On top of that, as economic growth cooled off a bit in China, so did the country’s need for power. It cancelled 85 coal-fired plants that had been in the works. India had a similar story, which further reduced the demand for coal. The turnaround in 2017 came from a slight rise in the price of natural gas, which made coal more competitive on the domestic front. An uptick in demand for coal from China’s steelmakers raised prices for metallurgical coal, which allowed smaller mines that had been idled to come back online, Lego said. Clean air regulations put coal at a disadvantage compared to natural gas, he said, as electric utilities increasingly opted for natural gas as a cleaner fuel. ""Those rules were fully implemented in 2015,"" Lego said. ""That’s when you saw the old coal-fired plants retired."" Lego said he’s seen no impact so far from the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce regulatory pressures on coal. The one change championed by the White House that holds the most promise, he said, would require utilities to keep larger stocks of fuel on hand. Administration policies could have a larger impact down the line. The Columbia University research group estimated that if fully implemented, the White House policies could increase production by 37 percent over what might have been under Obama administration policies. Trump said that coal production rose 7.8 percent since 2016. The number tracks back to a government forecast, which is less certain than actual production figures. But based on data for the first nine months of 2017, the increase was even higher -- 12 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. Trump tied the increase to the theme of ""ending the war on coal."" The research we found said shifts in the price of natural gas and foreign demand are the primary drivers, not government regulation. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A76080>],/factchecks/2017/nov/06/donald-trump/trump-pairs-recent-rise-coal-output-ending-war-coa/

Did Rick Scott brag about Florida's minimum wage? Philip Levine claim misleads
","Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine wasted no time attacking current Gov. Rick Scott as he jumped into the 2018 governor’s race. In a Nov. 1, 2017, speech announcing his run, Levine, a Democrat, criticized the governor for being so proud of the state’s minimum wage that he’s advertising it. ""When workers are paid $8.10 an hour, and our current governor runs ads bragging about it — it’s callous and it’s wrong,"" Levine said. Florida’s minimum wage is $8.10 and will rise 15 cents in January 2018. Has Scott run ads bragging about it? Not directly. The radio ad in question comes from Enterprise Florida, the state’s public-private economic development arm chaired by Scott. The ad did boast about Florida’s lack of income tax and Scott’s efforts to cut regulations. But Levine went too far in saying Scott bragged about the state’s minimum wage. Levine’s spokesman Christian Ulvert sent two columns by opinion writers and one article that discussed radio ads in California that coincided with a business recruitment trip by Scott in May 2016. The Enterprise Florida ad talked about lost jobs that would come if California approved a $15 minimum wage. When the ad brought up Florida, the focus was on lower taxes and less regulation, not Florida’s minimum wage explicitly. ""Seven hundred thousand. That’s how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage. Ready to leave California? Go to Florida instead — no state income tax, and Gov. Scott has cut regulations. Now Florida is adding 1 million jobs, not losing them.""   We didn’t hear back from Scott by our deadline. When we last looked at the ad in 2016, a Scott spokeswoman said the ad wasn’t Scott bragging about low wages, but rather him pointing out differences between the states’ economies. ""He has never said he is proud of how low our wages are,"" said Jackie Schutz Zeckman, now Scott’s chief of staff. Levine’s spokesman disagreed, arguing the the ""intent and purpose"" of the ad, as interpreted by newspaper editorial writers and columnists, was centered around wages. ""The governor has bragged about Florida's low wages a number of times and allowed tax dollars to be used to highlight that fact in California,"" Ulvert said. ""All facts."" Ulvert also pointed to the state’s decision to join the lawsuit against Miami Beach’s minimum wage ordinance that aimed to increase the city starting wage to $13.31 by 2021. (The ordinance was struck down in Miami-Dade circuit court in March.) Ulvert has a point that multiple news outlets — mostly columnists — have accused Scott of plugging low wages in the context of the radio ad and trips to California, even though he’s never explicitly said it. Here’s an example editorial from the Palm Beach Post. ""Gov. Rick Scott has spent the week on another job poaching expedition, this time in California. The prowling governor aimed to entice employers to move their companies to the Sunshine State. His pitch: Wages are low in Florida."" This isn’t the first time we’ve looked at this argument. Scott has openly tried to steal jobs from other states for years. In 2016, then-U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham accused Scott of going ""around the country"" and bragging about Florida’s low wages to other states. Florida’s wages in 2016 were low by national standards, but it didn’t appear Scott boasted (at least publicly) about this fact while recruiting businesses from other states. When we reviewed Scott’s statements from these recruiting missions, we found he did focus quite a bit on the state’s low taxes for businesses. He never explicitly advertised it like Graham, and now Levine, said. ""By raising the minimum wage in California, 700,000 people are going to lose their jobs, there are a lot of opportunities for companies to prosper in Florida and compete here, and that's what I'm going after,"" Scott said on his three-day tour. By the way, PolitiFact Florida previously researched whether California stood to lose 700,000 jobs because of the wage increase and rated the statement Mostly False. We learned the figure was a projection of how many jobs California could have added by 2026 if it didn’t increase the minimum wage, not a decline in net employment. Levine said Scott has run ads bragging about Florida’s minimum wage, which is currently $8.10 an hour.   The closest example is Enterprise Florida’s California radio ad, which is critical of California’s $15 minimum wage but never explicitly brags or talks about Florida’s minimum wage. Levine put words in Scott's mouth, when at most there is an implication. We rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CEB900>],/factchecks/2017/nov/06/philip-levine/levine-wrongly-says-scott-ad-bragged-about-states-/

Progressive group accuses Senate splinter group of cashing in with donors
","A progressive advocacy group says eight Democrats in the New York State Senate accepted money from campaign donors who typically support Republicans. A video released by The Creative Resistance targets the Independent Democratic Conference, a faction of Democrats aligned with Republicans instead of the other 23 Democrats in the Senate. ""IDC members also get tons of campaign money from real estate, charter school, and health care lobbyists, some of whom are Republicans with connections to Trump,"" the narrator says. Outside groups often give to the majority party in each chamber. Republicans now hold a majority of 40 members, including IDC members and a Democrat who sits with the Republican conference. The video claims members of the IDC cashed in with donors who also contributed to GOP lawmakers. Is that true? Giving money in the Senate Special interest groups can give money to support candidates in two ways: to candidates directly or to a political party committee. In the State Senate, the Republicans, Democrats and IDC each has its own campaign account. The list of donors The Creative Resistance sent us to support its claim is long. Filings from the state Board of Elections show its claim is accurate -- the IDC did get money from real estate, charter school and health care lobbyists. But so did both Republicans and Democrats. Some health care examples: Charter schools Republicans in the State Legislature are more likely to support legislation that benefits charter schools. That’s reflected through donations they receive from charter school groups. Two of those groups, New Yorkers for Putting Students First and the Coalition for Public Charter Schools, have not given to mainline Senate Democrats since 2011. They gave about $167,000 to the IDC and its members and about $233,000 to Republicans. Eva Moskowitz, the founder of Success Academy Charter Schools, has favored the IDC over Democrats in the Senate. Her political action committee, Great Public Schools, has given about $66,000 to the IDC and its members since 2011. The PAC gave $114,000 to Senate Republicans, while six members of the mainline Democratic conference were given about $38,000 from the group. Real estate Some IDC donors from the real estate industry have ties to President Donald Trump, the video claims. The largest real estate donor on the group’s list is the Real Estate Board of New York, a statewide group that advocates for real estate developers. The Creative Resistance says the group is tied to Trump through his children. Both Eric and Ivanka Trump are members of  the board. The board has given slightly more than $1 million to the Senate Republican campaign account and members since 2011. The IDC has received about $480,000 while mainline Democrats were given about $207,000. The IDC's response The IDC responded to the group's claim with its own analysis of major donors from health care, charter school and real estate lobbyists. ""An honest review of campaign finance donations of all Democrats in New York illustrates that these same donors contribute to Democrats across the state, and the Senate's minority Democratic conference is no exception,"" IDC spokesperson Candice Giove said. Our ruling The Creative Resistance said in a video ""IDC members also get tons of campaign money from real estate, charter school, and health care lobbyists, some of whom are Republicans with connections to Trump."" The IDC and its members do get money from donors in the lobbyists. But so do mainline Democrats, even if it’s less than their IDC colleagues. It's not true the IDC members benefit while Democrats do not.  The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information.

Republican mailer claims 'liberals in County Hall' are trying to make Erie County a sanctuary county
","A political mailer claims liberals in the Erie County Legislature want to make the county a ""haven"" for undocumented immigrants. The Republican mailer doesn't identify the liberals but says they want Erie County to be designated as a sanctuary county. Such counties allow undocumented immigrants to remain there without fear of deportation unless a serious crime is committed. The New York Republican State Committee sent the mailer to county residents urging voters to vote for Republicans in Erie County Legislature races on Election Day. ""Liberals in County Hall want our community to be a sanctuary county,"" the front of the mailer reads. ""Vote Republican, Tuesday, November 7th."" The mailer also makes the claim of a ""movement"" to make Erie a sanctuary county. Is that true? What's this about? Democrats in the Erie County Legislature have not introduced legislation that would make Erie County a sanctuary county. ""Neither the county executive nor any Democratic legislator ever introduced any legislation calling for Erie County to be a sanctuary county,"" said Peter Anderson, a spokesman for Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz. We couldn’t find any legislation introduced by any legislator -- liberal or not -- that would designate Erie County as a sanctuary county. A spokesperson for the New York Republican State Committee said the mailer refers to legislation introduced by Republican Legislator Ted Morton in December 2016. Morton’s resolution would have reaffirmed Erie County as a non-sanctuary county. It would not have changed any law.  But Morton’s resolution didn’t even make it to a vote in committee. Republican Legislator Kevin Hardwick, the chairman of the Legislature's Government Affairs Committee, told Spectrum News at the time that he didn’t think the issue was ""a huge pressing problem in Erie County."" So the resolution was tabled and never brought up again. One Democratic legislator, Patrick Burke, opposed the resolution because he thought Morton was creating a false narrative about undocumented immigrants in Erie County. Burke may have opposed Morton’s bill, but he did not publicly advocate for Erie County to become a sanctuary county. Our ruling A mailer from the New York Republican State Committee said ""liberals in County Hall want our community to be a sanctuary county."" There’s no evidence that’s true. In fact, the resolution the mailer is talking about was blocked by a Republican who controls the Government Affairs Committee.

Kearns a constant critic to Sheldon Silver while in Assembly
","Assemblymember Michael P. Kearns, a Democrat who’s running on the Republican line for Erie County clerk, says he has a history of standing up to leadership in government. Kearns claims in a television ad that he wasn’t shy about calling out Sheldon Silver, who served as State Assembly speaker for two decades before his conviction on federal corruption charges in 2015. ""When I saw corruption and sexual harassment cover-ups I called on Sheldon Silver to resign,"" Kearns says in the ad. Some of his colleagues in the Assembly found it difficult to oppose Silver, even after his arrest. Kearns says he didn’t fall into that camp. Is that true? Sexual harassment in the State Assembly Kearns first called for Silver to resign in 2013. It was Kearns’ first full year in the Assembly. Kearns chose to conference with the Democratic majority in the Assembly when he first took office in 2012. That lasted about a year. Then news broke that Silver had helped cover up reports of sexual harassment in the State Assembly. A state ethics report accused former Assemblyman Vito Lopez of harassing at least eight women during his time in the chamber. The report accused Silver and his staff of failing to properly investigate the sexual harassment claims against Lopez. Silver also approved a confidential settlement of more than $100,000 for two women who accused Lopez of harassment. When the ethics report was released, Kearns called for Silver to resign. He also left the Democratic conference in the Assembly. ""I am a father with a teenage daughter,"" Kearns wrote in The Buffalo News. ""I must ask, ‘Would I trust my daughter’s welfare under Sheldon Silver’s leadership or supervision?’ The record is clear beyond a reasonable doubt: The answer is ‘no.’ "" Silver’s corruption charges Kearns again called for Silver to resign in 2015. Silver was arrested on federal corruption charges in January 2015. Federal prosecutors accused Silver of using his position as speaker to accept millions of dollars worth of bribes and kickbacks. Kearns, who never re-joined the Democratic conference, called for Silver’s resignation the morning he was arrested. ""Secret settlements, sex scandals and now criminal allegations. All of the above should disqualify Silver from keeping leadership position,"" Kearns said in a tweet minutes after Silver’s arrest. At first, most Democratic Assembly members rallied behind Silver, their leader of two decades. Silver eventually stepped down after calls for his ouster mounted. Kearns did not re-join the Democratic conference until Silver was convicted later that year. His conviction has since been overturned, but prosecutors are expected to bring a new case against the long-time assemblymember. Our ruling Kearns said when he ""saw corruption and sexual harassment cover-ups I called on Sheldon Silver to resign."" Kearns first called on Silver to resign in 2013. He even left the Democratic conference because he did not support Silver as speaker. His position never changed.

Would the House GOP tax plan save a typical family $1,182?
","In unveiling the House Republicans’ tax bill, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., touted its positive impact for a typical American family. ""With this plan, the typical family of four will save $1,182 a year on their taxes,"" Ryan said Nov. 2. This amount is more than two-thirds lower than what the White House earlier said before the details of the House proposal were hammered out -- that ""the average American family would get a $4,000 raise under the President’s tax cut plan."" We have urged skepticism about the $4,000 figure. But what about the $1,182 figure? When we took a closer look at the math, we found that it leaves out some important qualifiers. The House Ways and Means Committee calculated several scenarios for how the proposal’s changes could affect different types of taxpayers. The key elements in this calculation involve tax brackets, the standard deduction and the child tax credit. Currently, there are seven brackets; these would be consolidated into four -- 12 percent (up from 10 percent today), 25 percent, 35 percent, and 39.6 percent. In the meantime, the standard deduction will be raised from $12,000 to $24,000. And the child tax credit will be increased from $1,000 to $1,600, bolstered by a new $300 credit for parents and other dependents. The example Ryan highlighted refers to a ""family of four making $59,000 per year."" Here’s the scenario outlined in the House’s fact sheet, using the fictional example of ""Steve and Melinda"" with two middle school-aged children: ""As a result of lower tax rates, a significantly larger standard deduction, and an enhanced Child Tax Credit and Family Flexibility Credit, Steve and Melinda will pay over $1,182 less in taxes than last year, reducing their total tax bill from $1,582 to only $400. ""That’s more money they can use for whatever is important to them, whether it’s paying bills, purchasing a new refrigerator, or putting away savings for the future."" The Ways and Means Committee, answering questions for Ryan’s office, said they chose a household income of $59,000 because it’s the median household income nationally. For that amount of income, a family today would get $12,700 from the standard deduction, $16,200 in personal exemptions, leaving $30,100 in taxable income. Of that, $18,650 would be taxed at 10 percent and $11,450 would be taxed at 15 percent, meaning the preliminary tax liability would be $3,582.50. That would be adjusted with $2,000 in child tax credits, producing a final tax liability of $1,582.50. Under the new tax bill, the family would take a larger $24,000 standard deduction (the proposal eliminates personal exemptions), leaving $35,000 in taxable income. At the 12 percent rate, that would mean $4,200 in preliminary liability. This would be offset by $3,200 in child tax credits and $600 in family credits, leaving a final tax liability of $400. That’s a $1,182.50 tax cut. So Ryan has some mathematical detail to back up the figure. But it leaves out at least three caveats. The median household income is $59,000, but the median family income is almost $73,000: The Ways and Means Committee used the figure for median household income, but Ryan referred to the ""typical family of four."" The major difference is that households can include one person living alone, whereas a family is a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. So among families, a $59,000 income is not necessarily ""typical"" -- it’s actually in the bottom half of the income spectrum. The last time the median family income was as low as $59,000 was in 1985. On the other hand, Ryan's office notes that if you calculate the impact the same way for a family that earns $73,000, the savings are actually higher, at $1,602. Your mileage may vary: The GOP bill eliminates or shrinks a number of widely used itemized deductions, and those factors aren’t taken into account in the figure Ryan cited. The deductions eliminated or pared back in the bill include the mortgage interest deduction (for future mortgages, it would be capped at half its previous maximum); the state and local tax deduction (only $10,000 in property tax deductions would be allowed); the medical expense deduction; the casualty loss deduction; and the student loan interest deduction. Exchanging these changes for a higher standard deduction may benefit many taxpayers, particularly those who choose not to itemize today. But some taxpayers who depend on these itemized deductions today may end up worse off if the bill is passed as is, even with the higher standard deduction. For this type of taxpayer, the loss of even one of those deductions could conceivably wipe out that $1,182 gain for certain types of families. This specific amount of tax savings is good for just the first year: The benefits for this family shrink, slowly but surely, over the next decade. ""The tax cut definitely dissipates over time,"" David Kamin, a tax and budget specialist at the New York University law school, told PolitiFact. Kamin cited a combination of factors, including the sunsetting of the $300 per parent tax credit; the lack of inflation adjustments for the child tax credit, which effectively replace personal exemptions that were indexed to inflation; and the new use of an inflation adjustment measure known as chained CPI, which grows more slowly than the yardstick in current use. According to Kamin’s calculations, the initial tax cut for the family making $59,000 becomes a $500 tax increase by 2024 compared to the status quo. Here’s the graph he put together: Ryan said, ""With this plan, the typical family of four will save $1,182 a year on their taxes."" This is based on a plausible and transparent calculation, but Ryan glosses over some context. The calculation doesn’t factor in several itemized deductions that would disappear under the proposal and that could have a significant impact on at least some ""typical"" families around that income level. And Ryan’s statement is misleading when he says the family will save ""$1,182 a year,"" since that’s the case in the first year only; after that, the benefit starts to shrink and eventually turns into a tax hike. We rate the statement Half True.

The ban is gone, but owning a machine gun in Missouri isn't easy
","Following one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history in Las Vegas, State Rep. Nick Marshall, R-Parkville, was critical of the political rhetoric and expressed his discontent in an Oct. 2 Missourinet article. ""When it comes to automatic weapons, that’s a federal issue as you know,"" Marshall said. State Rep. Stacey Newman, D-Richmond Heights, told Missourinet that Marshall was incorrect on automatic weapons being a federal issue. She pointed to House Bill 294, which passed in 2011. ""Part of this omnibus gun bill that year (was) legalizing machine guns in the state of Missouri,"" Newman said. ""We legalized them here. And ever since then, continually my whole time in the legislature, we have loosened restriction."" We were wondering, are machine guns legal in Missouri? Are they under federal or state jurisdiction? And, has Missouri loosened restrictions on them? We tried to reach out to Newman to clarify her statement, but received no response. We spoke with people knowledgeable on gun laws in Missouri, who said that when it came to Newman’s statement, there’s context missing and multiple ways to interpret it. Basically, a machine gun is an automatic weapon that is capable of firing more than one round per trigger pull, Allen Rostron, law professor at University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law, said in an email. A semi-automatic requires a finger pull for each round but automatically loads the chamber after a shot. The sale of automatic weapons has been restricted since the National Firearms Act was enacted in 1934. The act was inspired, in part, because of frequent use of machine guns in crime, including the 1929 St. Valentine’s Day Massacre in Chicago and the 1933 Union Station Massacre in Kansas City. The original act imposed a tax on automatic weapons and required they be registered with the Secretary of the Treasury, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. ""It essentially amounted to a ban, because it became a crime to possess a machine gun without having it properly registered with the government,"" Rostron said. ""But technically it wasn’t actually a ban, because it didn’t prohibit machine guns. It just made them subject to much stricter regulations than other guns."" In 1986, Congress passed additional regulations that cut off the supply of new machine guns to civilian buyers. Any existing machine guns manufactured before May 19, 1986, are still allowed to be purchased and were grandfathered into the law. Essentially, that’s where the federal law stands today. ""There are something like 400,000 or 500,000 of these machine guns that are legally possessed by civilians in the United States,"" Rostron said. Prior to 2011, Missouri prohibited the possession of machine guns in the state. HB 294, which Newman referenced, ""Allows a person to possess, manufacture, transport, repair, or sell a machine gun, short barreled rifle or shotgun, or firearm silencer if he or she conforms with federal law,"" according to the bill summary. The bill passed by a majority in both the House and the Senate and was signed into law by Gov. Jay Nixon. ""So in other words, Missouri went from having a stricter law that completely banned machine guns to having a law that said you’re allowed to have a machine gun if federal law permits it,"" Rostron said. As of April 2017, there were 9,588 machine guns registered in Missouri, according to a 2017 ATF report, said Hannah Shearer, staff attorney and Second Amendment litigation director for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that advocates for more restrictive gun regulation. So is Marshall or Newman correct that machine guns are a federal or state issue? Well, it depends. Marshall is correct that federal law has the ultimate jurisdiction over machine guns. However, states can impose stricter laws that go beyond federal law, such as Missouri did prior to 2011. ""Rep. Marshall’s statement is incomplete or inaccurate to the extent it suggests state law is completely irrelevant to this,"" Rostron said. ""So it is not purely a federal issue as he seemed to suggest."" However, Newman’s statement could also be misleading. She is correct that machine guns were legalized in Missouri, but they must still comply with federal law. ""If her statement gives people the impression that machine guns have been legalized in Missouri and so now they’re not subject to any special restrictions, then that is not correct, because machine guns remain subject to the federal (National Firearms Act) restrictions that apply throughout the nation,"" Rostron said. ""This is theater,"" St. Louis University School of Law Professor Anders Walker said in an email about Newman’s statement. ""Machine guns are controlled by federal law, full stop,"" and linked to a Giffords Law Center webpage. An NRA spokeswoman agreed. Kevin Jamison, attorney and president of the Western Missouri Shooters Alliance, pointed to the fact that no state agency regulates machine guns, and said that the only difference is that the Missouri law allows prosecutors to try a case in a Missouri court. ""Doesn’t happen very often, but it could possibly happen,"" Jamison said. Newman also said, ""Ever since (House Bill 294 passed), continually my whole time in the Legislature, we have loosened restriction."" Experts said the accuracy of Newman’s statement depends on whether she was referring to machine guns specifically or gun laws in general. When it comes to machine guns, experts said Missouri has not loosened restrictions since 2011. However, Shearer pointed out that the state has loosened restriction on gun laws more generally. ""Rep. Newman is also correct that Missouri has weakened its gun laws over time, including last year, when state lawmakers overrode the governor’s veto to enact permitless concealed carry,"" Shearer said. ""Missouri’s weak laws correlate with a comparatively high gun death rate. In 2016 Missouri had the ninth highest per capita gun death rate among all the states,"" pointing to a Giffords Law Center scorecard. Newman said, Missouri legalized machine guns. There’s some truth to that, but also some caveats. In 2011, the Missouri legislature overturned a full ban of automatic weapons. But all that did was make state law comply with federal law. Federal law doesn’t outright ban machine guns, but it does heavily regulate them. Generally, machine guns are hard to acquire.

How many 'Democrat campaign donors' on special counsel team probing Trump campaign-Russia ties?
","U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, a northern Wisconsin Republican who has consistently backed Donald Trump, is making Democrat-bias allegations about a man who may pose a threat to Trump’s presidency: special counsel Robert Mueller. On Oct. 30, 2017, Mueller’s investigation produced its first criminal charges, its first guilty plea and the first public confirmation that an aide to Trump’s campaign sought an allegiance with Russians to gather ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton. Duffy made his claim about Mueller the same day on CNN’s ""New Day"" show. He referred to Clinton, Trump’s Democratic rival in the 2016 election, and the Democratic National Committee, saying: First of all, I support the investigation; I’m not asking for it to end. But I do have concerns that Mueller’s bringing in Democrat campaign donors at a very high level …. And I think that’s a mistake on his part. Let’s bring in non-partisan folks that -- or at least don’t have a partisan record because I think you open yourself up to criticism in making it partisan. So, how many of Mueller’s lawyers have made campaign contributions to Democrats, and how much? And is there evidence of a partisan bias on Mueller’s team? The charges and plea Duffy’s interview was prompted by the most significant developments for the special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his business associate, Rick Gates, were indicted on a dozen felony counts, including money laundering. And George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the campaign, pleaded guilty to misleading the FBI about outreach efforts to Russian government officials. Papadopoulos is accused of falsely telling the FBI he was not part of the Trump campaign when a person described as an ""overseas professor"" told him that Russians possessed ""dirt"" on Clinton, in the form of ""thousands of emails."" As for Mueller, the special counsel’s office told us that it confirmed that Mueller is a longtime and current Republican. He is a former federal prosecutor who served as the FBI director under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, from 2001 to 2013. He was a partner at the WilmerHale law firm when he was chosen as the special counsel by the U.S. Justice Department in May 2017. Previous claim about the team A month after Mueller’s selection, Trump implied the investigation was politically motivated, making a claim more extreme than Duffy’s in saying: ""I can say that the people that have been hired (for the independent Russia investigation) are all Hillary Clinton supporters, some of them worked for Hillary Clinton."" PolitiFact National rated Trump’s statement Mostly False. At that point, the names of eight lawyers on Mueller’s team had been made public. Three had made campaign contributions to Clinton, but none had worked for her. One had defended the Clinton Foundation in court for WilmerHale. And another represented a Clinton aide, also for WilmerHale. The Justice Department looked into the contributions and employment histories of all of Mueller’s hires and determined them consistent with the rules of professional responsibility. Duffy's claim is a little more broad. Mueller’s team and their contributions Duffy’s office referred us to news reports on campaign contributions made by Mueller team members. The special counsel’s office told us that Mueller has 16 lawyers on his team, but that one of them has not been named publicly. That office provided us figures on how much the lawyers have given in total to Democrats and Republicans in federal campaigns. We also checked Federal Election Commission filings. Here’s what we found: Six of the 15 lawyers have not made campaign contributions to any political campaigns at the federal level. Among the lawyers who did make contributions, a total of $62,043 went to Democrats and $2,750 to Republicans, according to the special counsel’s office. In terms of Clinton specifically, election filings indicate that three lawyers gave her 2016 presidential campaign a total of $700; and three gave a total of $18,100 to either her 2016 campaign or her 2008 run for the presidential nomination. As for the implication of Duffy’s claim, here are points worth noting: One of the lawyers was a member of the team that won the 2015 conviction on federal corruption charges of Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who had been the longtime speaker of the New York State Assembly. The special counsel’s office pointed out to us that the legal standards for Justice Department hiring ""prohibit the use of political or ideological affiliations to assess applicants."" On that point, the Washington Post Fact Checker reported, in a June 2017 fact check on this issue: Federal regulations prohibit the Justice Department from considering the political affiliation or political contributions of career appointees, including those appointed to the Special Counsel’s Office. So the implication that Mueller is making politically motivated hires is quite a stretch, as he is legally prohibited from considering their political affiliations. Our rating
  Duffy says Mueller ""has brought in Democrat campaign donors at a very high level"" on his team of lawyers. Six of the 15 lawyers who have been publicly identified have not made campaign contributions to any political campaigns at the federal level. But among the lawyers who did make contributions, a total of $62,043 went to Democrats and $2,750 to Republicans, according to the special counsel’s office. As for a Democratic bias in the investigation, Duffy doesn’t specifically make that charge. But Mueller himself is a longtime Republican. And he is prohibited from choosing lawyers based on political affiliations.
