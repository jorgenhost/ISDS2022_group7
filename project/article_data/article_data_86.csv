Newt Gingrich says that in New York City, starting janitor is paid twice as much as a starting teacher
","
During a Republican presidential debate on Dec. 10, 2011, in Iowa, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., made a striking claim about how overpaid New York City school janitors are (or, perhaps, how underpaid teachers are). The remark came in the context of Gingrich’s suggestion that poor students should be given the opportunity to fill duties currently handled by school janitors, calling it a way to instill a work eithic while also saving money. 
""As to schools, I think every person up here worked at a young age,"" Gingrich said. ""What I suggested was kids ought to be able to work part time in school, particularly in the poorest neighborhoods, both because they could use the money. If you take one half of the New York janitors who unionized and paid more than the teachers -- an entry level janitor gets paid twice as much as an entry level teacher. You take half those janitors you could give -- you give lots of poor kids a work experience in the cafeteria, in the school library, in the front office and a lot of different things."" 
We received a flurry of requests from readers that we fact-check the claim that in New York City, ""an entry level janitor gets paid twice as much as an entry level teacher."" 
We suspect that Gingrich’s claim originated with an April 18, 2011, report by the local NBC News affiliate titled, ""School Custodians Earn More Than Bronx Teachers."" Here’s an excerpt: 
""Teachers in at least one Bronx school earn less money than the building custodian, a stat that has surprised students and parents. 
""Although it is commonly assumed teachers' wages top the salaries of custodians, an NBC New York analysis of public payrolls shows many custodians make more money than even the highest paid city teachers. 
""According to the union contract governing New York City Custodian Engineers, the men and women responsible for keeping school buildings clean and operating can make up to $114,000 a year in base pay. The highest paid teacher, with a masters degree and decades of tenure, can hope to make just over $100,000 in base pay. … 
""The pay-scale differences are even more pronounced for rookie teachers and custodians. First-year New York City school teachers without graduate degrees, make about $45,000 a year. The minimum pay for a first-year custodial engineer is almost $80,000 a year."" 
The NBC story was correct about the starting salary for teachers in the New York City Department of Education, at least those with only a bachelor’s degree and no prior teaching experience. Such teachers start at $45,530. Teachers who have a master’s degree but no teaching experience start at $51,425. 
But what about the people Gingrich called ""janitors""? This is where he runs into trouble. 
The NBC piece referred to a ""first-year custodial engineer."" That’s a much more senior position, requiring specific skills and experience. Here’s how the official exam describes ""what the job involves"" at ""assignment level 1,"" the lower of two levels: 
""Under general supervision (custodial engineers) supervise and are responsible for the physical operation, maintenance, repair, custodial upkeep and care of a public school building and its immediate grounds; supervise, plan and are responsible for the work of the custodial and maintenance staff; heat building by means of low pressure boilers; maintain HVAC equipment; make minor repairs to steam plant, heating equipment, electrical equipment, plumbing, structure, glazing and furniture; supervise cleaning of the building and grounds; maintain the building and grounds in a safe, secure and sanitary condition; conduct inspections of building to determine needed repairs; consult with and advise officials on problems of operation, maintenance and repairs; set up custodial work schedules to ensure maximum efficiency and minimum interference with classroom activities; requisition and account for custodial and maintenance materials, tools and supplies; maintain records and prepare required reports of plant operations; within assigned budget, hire appropriate personnel and train or arrange for their training, prepare payrolls and personnel forms, pay wages and provide Worker’s Compensation Insurance for hired personnel; are responsible for interior maintenance painting of school building; perform related work."" 
Somehow, we don’t think a middle-schooler or high-schooler is qualified to ""make minor repairs to steam plant, heating equipment, electrical equipment, plumbing, structure,"" or ""requisition and account for custodial and maintenance materials, tools and supplies,"" or ""hire appropriate personnel and train or arrange for their training, prepare payrolls and personnel forms, pay wages and provide Worker’s Compensation Insurance."" 
Custodial engineers are actually supervisory positions. In fact, you can’t even apply for this job unless you have a ""four-year high school diploma or its educational equivalent and one year of full-time paid satisfactory experience in operating boilers."" 
For all these responsibilities, what do you get paid? In 2004, when the exam announcement we found was released, the rate was $41,500. Today, it’s $55,625, according to Robert J. Troeller, president and business manager of Local 891 of the International Union of Operating Engineers in Brooklyn, N.Y. 
The latter amount is higher than teachers with either a bachelor’s degree or a master’s agree -- but it’s not double, as Gingrich said. And more importantly, we don’t think a starting custodial engineer would be what Gingrich calls an ""entry level janitor."" 
We asked Troeller for the beginning wages for lower-level custodial positions in schools according to collective bargaining agreements. In descending order of skills required, they are: 
Engineer (responsible for boilers that require special training): $23.38 per hour, equivalent to $48,630 for a full year. 
Fireman (runs the boilers): $20.68 per hour, or $43,014 for a full year. 
Handyman: $17.68 per hour, or $36,774 for a full year. 
Cleaner: $15.77 per hour, or $32,801 for a full year. (First- and second-year employees are paid below the standard rate; in year three, it goes up to the standard rate of $18.13 an hour.) 
We agree with Troeller that ""cleaner"" best fits the description of ""entry level janitor"" as used by Gingrich. And for that, even the least credentialed starting teacher earns about 1.4 times as much as a starting cleaner, and a starting teacher with a graduate degree earns 1.6 times as much. (We’re assuming here that new cleaners work a 40-hour week and a 52-week year, which is not necessarily the case, Troeller said.) 
Our ruling

Gingrich could have argued that the contracts for unionized New York City custodial engineers max out at a higher level than that for teachers; that much is true. Instead, he twisted the statistic beyond recognition. 
Starting custodial engineers do earn more than starting teachers, but not ""twice"" the amount. Meanwhile, a custodial engineer is a credentialed supervisory position, not an ""entry level janitor."" When you compare apples to apples -- an entry-level unionized ""cleaner"" to an entry-level unionized teacher -- the teacher earns 1.4 to 1.6 times more. We rate the statement False. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280974EB100>],/factchecks/2011/dec/12/newt-gingrich/newt-ginrgich-says-new-york-city-starting-janitor-/

David Brooks says Newt Gingrich once proposed putting mirrors in space
","
In a Dec. 9, 2011, column titled, ""The Gingrich Tragedy,"" New York Times columnist David Brooks expressed ambivalence about the new front-runner in the Republican presidential race, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. 
Brooks said that ideologically, Gingrich ""comes closest to my worldview."" But Brooks added that he was repelled by Gingrich’s ""bombastic"" style and ""revolutionary temperament — intensity, energy, disorganization and a tendency to see everything as a cataclysmic clash requiring a radical response."" 
In the column, Brooks cites negatively what he considered half-baked ideas by Gingrich. ""For example, he has called for ‘a massive new program to build a permanent lunar colony to exploit the moon’s resources.’ He has suggested that ‘a mirror system in space could provide the light equivalent of many full moons so that there would be no need for nighttime lighting of the highways.’"" 
The space-mirror system seemed so outlandish that we felt compelled to check whether Gingrich really suggested it. 
We e-mailed Brooks to ask where he found this quote, but we didn’t hear back. We did, however, locate a similar quote in an article by Andrew Ferguson published in the New York Times magazine on June 29, 2011. Ferguson read 21 books by Gingrich -- a famously prolific author -- in an attempt to answer his article’s titular question: ""What Does Newt Gingrich Know?"" 
Here’s a portion of what Ferguson wrote: 
""Gingrich’s first book, Window of Opportunity: A Blueprint for the Future, came out in 1984 and contained the seeds of much of what was to follow. Beneath its cover image — a flag-draped eagle inexplicably threatening the space shuttle— the backbencher Gingrich was identified as chairman of the congressional Space Caucus, a position that inspired a series of ‘space cadet’ jokes that took years to die. Window of Opportunity was co-written by Gingrich’s second wife, Marianne, and a science-fiction writer called David Drake.  ... 
""In Window of Opportunity, Gingrich introduced himself as a futurist, a role he has played off and on throughout his career. There are problems inherent in futurism, most of them involving the future, which the futurist is obliged to predict (it’s his job) and which seldom cooperates as he would hope. Gingrich has called some and missed some. In 1984, he saw more clearly than most that computers would touch every aspect of commercial and private life, but nobody any longer wants to build ‘a large array of mirrors [that] could affect the earth’s climate,’ warming it up so farmers could extend the growing season."" 
Because the quotes from Brooks and Ferguson are slightly different, we wanted to look directly at the book ourselves before making our judgment. 
In the book, Gingrich proposes (among many other ideas) ""five simple steps to a bold future"" in space, most unusually a lottery in which randomly selected taxpayers would win a spot on a space shuttle flight. But the floating mirror idea isn’t on this list. Instead, it’s included in Gingrich's recap of a June 1979, NASA-sponsored new concepts symposium in Woods Hole, Mass., ""where 30 experts brainstormed a range of pioneering options for NASA worthy of Lewis and Clark."" 
Here’s how Gingrich summarized the idea: 
""The climate group at the Woods Hole conference suggested that a large array of mirrors could affect the earth’s climate by increasing the amount of sunlight received by particular areas, citing recent feasibility studies exploring the possibilities of preventing frosts in Florida or enabling farmers in high altitudes to plant their wheat earlier. 
""A mirror system in space could provide the light equivalent of many full moons so that there would be no need for nighttime lighting of the highways. Ambient light covering entire areas could reduce the current danger of criminals lurking in the darkness. Mirrors could be arranged to light given metropolitan areas only during particular periods, so there would be darkness late at night for sleeping."" 
Brooks’ portrayal glosses over the fact that Gingrich was primarily reciting proposals made by participants at a NASA-sponsored forum. Still, Gingrich cited them approvingly. 
Still, we didn’t want to stop with a look at whether Brooks framed the issue fairly. We also wanted to know whether this was ever a mainstream idea -- and whether it’s technologically feasible. 
One thing that’s clear is that it was not a new idea by the time it was raised at Woods Hole. At least two space pioneers promoted the concept in the 1920s, a full four decades before man landed on the moon. 
Hermann Oberth (1894-1989), a scientific author based in Germany, published several books in the 1920s that anticipated the ""first rockets and satellites, … the landing on the moon, interplanetary probes, international manned space stations, and reusable space ferries,"" according to the museum that celebrates his life near Nuremberg, Germany. Among the ideas discussed in his books was ""extraterrestrial utilization of the sun's energy with huge space mirrors that beam the collected sun energy down to earth."" 
These ideas were popularized in a book by another space pioneer, an Austro-Hungarian named Hermann Noordung (1892-1929) in a 1928 book, The Problem of Space Travel: The Rocket Motor. 
So the idea is an old one. But despite several decades’ worth of advances in space technology by the time Gingrich published his book, space experts and scientists told us that the idea never got much beyond the science fiction stage. 
Yuri Pavlovich Semenov -- until 2005 the chief designer for Energia, the developer of Russian manned spacecraft -- ""was quite a proponent"" of the idea, said Marcia Smith of spacepolicyonline.com. During the Soviet era, Semenov and his allies thought such a technology could light up the northern latitudes of the USSR. However, ""it was considered impractical by the mainstream space crowd, not just technically but in terms of the potential environmental effects,"" Smith said. 
John Logsdon, the founder and retired director of the Space Policy Institute at the George Washington University Elliott School of International Affairs, said that similar ideas ""have been suggested over the years by ‘out of the box’ thinkers, but they never entered the mainstream."" 
Others have suggested using mirrors to reflect the sun’s rays away from the earth, as a way to attack global warming, said Edward Ellegood, a space policy analyst at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. 
But where Gingrich’s idea is concerned, Ellegood said, ""It’s probably not even remotely cost-effective."" 
Here’s another problem: ""Micro-meteorite bombardment would destroy these mirrors over a few-year time period,"" said Gregory Bothun, a University of Oregon physicist. 
The experts we spoke to for this story agreed that even if the idea proposed by Gingrich in 1984 was economically and technically feasible, it would entail too many downsides to be desirable. 
""Imagine a world where it never got dark! What would this do to plants, animals, my sleep, and the souls of poets and lovers everywhere?"" said Scott Denning, an atmospheric science professor at Colorado State University, in an e-mail. ""Imagine having a really annoying neighbor who beams sodium vapor lamps into your bedroom windows. Now imagine everyone in the world having such a neighbor."" 
Raymond S. Bradley, a geoscientist at the University of Massachusetts, put it simply: ""This is not a mainstream idea. It is one of the dumbest ideas I have heard of."" 
Our ruling 
Gingrich co-wrote his book more than a quarter century ago, and since he doesn’t appear to have reiterated the call for floating mirrors in recent years, we can safely assume the idea is no longer at the top of his policy agenda. But did cite the idea approvingly in his book, so we rate Brooks’ statement True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BC11C0>],/factchecks/2011/dec/12/david-brooks/david-brooks-says-newt-gingrich-once-proposed-putt/
"['New Jersey', 'Education', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie says New Jersey teachers only work 180 days a year, average $60K salaries
","
New Jersey teachers have a pretty cushy gig, to hear Gov. Chris Christie tell it.

They only work about six months a year and are paid north of $50,000 annually, according to a speech about education that Christie gave Nov. 18 at Notre Dame’s law school in South Bend, Ind.

""They say teachers only make on an average in New Jersey 60,000 dollars a year. They  only work 180 days,"" the governor said between comments about the number of hours teachers work daily and how he supports higher pay for ""excellent teachers.""

But Christie should have checked his work before making this claim. His numbers are a bit off from the true numbers, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

Let’s first discuss teacher schedules.

A minimum 180-day school year is required by state statute, but a majority of school districts in New Jersey exceed that minimum, according to the New Jersey Education Association.

The NJEA provided us with documents showing the average number of school days for the 2010-11 and 2011-12 school years: 185, among school districts with settled contracts. That amounts to 257 districts for the current school year, 423 for last year and 511 for the 2005-06 year.

New Jersey’s number of instruction days is the same as at least 30 other states, according to the Denver, Colo.-based Education Commission of the States.

NJEA spokesman Steve Baker took exception to Christie’s statement that teachers ""only"" work 180 days a year.

""The really misleading part of the statement is that it assumes teachers don’t work any additional days beyond those stipulated in their contracts, which is wrong,"" Baker said in an email. ""Most – indeed, nearly all -- teachers spend many additional days setting up their classrooms, preparing lesson plans, attending professional development events, taking classes and otherwise engaged in additional work outside the contracted school day and school year. You can imagine the amount of work that goes into preparing to teach 180 days of student classes.

""This is a common tactic that critics of public education use to denigrate the work of teachers, to make it sound as if they really don’t work that hard,"" Baker continued. ""It’s a bit like saying that the Governor is only working on days when he signs bills. In other words, wrong, and intentionally misleading.""

The governor’s office did not return a request for comment.

Michael W. Smith, a professor and chair of the Department of Curriculum, Instruction, and Technology in Education at Temple University in Philadelphia, said the work of a teacher neither begins nor ends in the classroom.

In addition to instructing classes, teachers often work at home or outside the classroom preparing lessons, reviewing students’ work and providing feedback, meeting with students outside class, staying abreast of educational technology, meeting continuing education requirements and much more, said Smith, who chaired the Department of Learning and Teaching at Rutgers University New Brunswick from 1992-2005.

William Gaudelli, an associate professor of Social Studies and Education, and the Social Studies program coordinator at Teachers College, Columbia University, agreed that the work teachers do goes well beyond 180 work days.

""It’s really a misrepresentation of the vast majority of teachers who are dedicated to their work,"" Gaudelli, a member of the South Orange-Maplewood Board of Education, said about Christie’s statement.

As for teacher salaries, Christie underestimated those numbers.

The average teacher salary in New Jersey for 2009-10 was $65,130 – the fourth highest in the country behind New York, Massachusetts and California, according to a 2011 report from the National Education Association.

Our ruling

In a speech last month to students at Notre Dame, the governor said New Jersey teachers on average only work 180 days a year and get $60,000 salaries. New Jersey’s school year averages 185 days and the average teacher salary in the state is $65,130. Christie was a bit off on both of his numbers, but not by much. Based strictly on numbers, we rate his statement Mostly True.

George Allen says U.S. lent $2 billion to Brazil for oil and gas exploration
","
U.S. Senate candidate George Allen wants to drill here and now.

The Republican has repeatedly reminded voters that the U.S. has the largest fossil fuel reserves in the world and faulted President Barack Obama for not aggressively developing them.

Allen brought up the issue again in a Dec. 7 debate against Democrat Tim Kaine, who is also pursuing the U.S. Senate seat in 2012 that will be vacated by Jim Webb, D-Va. Allen voiced frustration with the Obama administration’s refusal to allow oil and natural gas leases off Virginia’s coast.

""Our federal government has lent $2 billion to the state-owned oil company of Brazil to allow them to explore for oil and gas, and that shows how contradictory our energy policies are,"" Allen said.

Is the U.S. really financing $2 billion worth of off-shore energy production in Brazil?

To back the claim, the Allen campaign emailed postings from several websites, including Forbes Magazine. Our research, however, shows that some of the information in the articles was loosely interpreted by Allen, and some of the information was inaccurate.

All of the articles center on a tentative offer by the Export-Import Bank of the United States in April 2009 to provide up to $2 billion in financing to Petrobras, Brazil’s national oil company.

The Export-Import Bank is an independent federal agency that provides financing options -- including direct loans, guarantees of loans and  export-credit insurance -- to foreign buyers to help them purchase U.S. goods and services.  

The bank, as noted in a September story by PolitiFact’s national staff, receives its spending authority from Congress but gets no appropriated funds. It operates using revenues from the fees and interest that it charges lenders and borrowers, although its transactions are ultimately backed by the U.S. government’s faith and credit. The bank is allowed to have up to $100 billion in outstanding loans.

We called Ex-Im Bank’s spokesman, Phil Cogan, and asked him to assess Allen’s statement.

""It is not correct,"" he said.

Ex-Im’s tentative agreement was an ""expression of the bank’s willingness"" to consider up to $2 billion in loan applications from Petrobras to finance its purchase of U.S. goods and supplies. All five of the bank’s board of directors who approved the decision were appointed by former President George W. Bush, a Republican.

On Feb. 4, 2010, the Ex-Im Bank agreed to guarantee a $308 million private loan to Petrobras made by JPMorgan Chase. The loan guarantee is helping Petrobras purchase goods and services from about 150 U.S. companies, according to Cogan.

There were no other financial transactions between Ex-Im and Petrobras before their preliminary loan agreement expired in April 2011. Cogan said it has not been renewed.

So Ex-Im did not directly lend any money to Petrobras, let alone the $2 billion Allen claimed. All it did was back a $308 million loan that a private bank made to the Brazilian oil company.

Dan Allen, a senior adviser to the Allen campaign, told us George Allen should not be faulted for making a mistake about Ex-Im and Petrobras. He said George Allen based his statement on information published by credible news sources.

""We just didn’t come up with the stuff and throw it against the wall,"" Dan Allen said. ""We relied on something published on Forbes magazine’s website.""

He referred us to a May 2011 posting headlined ""Petrobras to Tap Ex-Im Loan `Soon.’"" The Forbes article, however, appears to be referring to the closing of JPMorgan Chase’s loan to Petrobras that Ex-Im guaranteed.

Dan Allen also sent us an article that ran this August in The Hill, a publication that covers Congress. That story, however, never said a $2 billion loan had been made. It merely noted that ""Republicans railed against a 2009 proposed $2 billion commitment from the U.S. Import-Export Bank to the Brazilian oil company Petrobras.""

Different claims about about the loan have been circulated over the last two years by conservative voices such as The Wall Street Journal editorial page, Fox News and Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas.

Seeking to counter misinformation, Ex-Im has posted a website fact sheet about its relationship with Petrobras. The bank takes exception to statements by Allen and others that the dealings reflect inconsistent federal policies on off-shore drilling.

""There is no connection between the federal policies on offshore drilling in U.S. waters and financing U.S. export sales by other countries,"" the fact sheet says. ""In fact, should Ex-Im Bank refuse to finance sales by U.S. companies it is likely that the sales will go instead to their foreign competitors.""

Our conclusion:

Allen says the U.S. government lent $2 billion to Petrobras, the state-owned oil company of Brazil.

He is referring to a preliminary agreement by the U.S. Export-Import Bank, an independent federal agency, to consider offering up to $2 billion in financing to help Petrobras buy American goods and services.

In 2010, Ex-Im agreed to guarantee a $308 million private loan made to Petrobras by JPMorgan Chase. There were no other transactions, and Ex-Im’s agreement with Petrobras expired this April.

The bottom line is that that Ex-Im did not directly lend any money to Petrobras. We rate Allen’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809BFE1700>],/factchecks/2011/dec/12/george-allen/allen-says-us-lent-2-billion-brazil-oil-and-gas-ex/

Texas GOP chair says more Hispanics have won statewide office on the Republican ticket than as Democratic nominees
","
Questioning how a panel of San Antonio federal judges redrew legislative districts that had been passed into law by the Republican-controlled 2011 Legislature, the Republican Party of Texas also challenged the idea that the judges protected Hispanic voting rights.

Republican Chairman Steve Munisteri said in a Dec. 5, 2011, email blast that the court ""seems to fail to take into account the fact that more Hispanics have been elected statewide on the Republican ticket than on the Democratic ticket.""

Wait a sec.

We recall that Texans elected Democrat Dan Morales, a San Antonio state representative, as attorney general of Texas in 1990. He won re-election in 1994. No other Latino candidate has been elected to a statewide executive position.

In the judiciary, Texans elected Democrat Raul Gonzalez to the Texas Supreme Court. He was initially appointed to the highest Texas civil court by Democratic Gov. Mark White in late 1984 before becoming the first Hispanic elected statewide in 1986. He stayed on the court through 1998.

So, have Republicans elected more Hispanics to statewide office?

Refresher: There are 29 statewide elected posts -- two U.S. Senate seats, six executive-like positions (governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, state comptroller, land commissioner and agriculture commissioner), three seats on the Texas Railroad Commission, which oversees the energy sector, and nine seats each on the Texas Supreme Court and Court of Criminal Appeals.

By email, Munisteri told us that he based his count of Hispanic winners on Texas state directories listing elected officials. Munisteri said he identified only two Democrats of Hispanic descent elected to statewide office -- Gonazalez and Morales, who did not seek re-election in 1998 and ultimately served prison time for financial misdeeds.

Latino Republicans elected statewide have included Al Gonzales, who won a race for the Texas Supreme Court in 2000 before joining George W. Bush in Washington, and Tony Garza and Victor Carrillo, who won Texas Railroad Commission races in 1998 and 2004, respectively. Garza later resigned to serve as U.S. ambassador to Mexico.

Also, Munisteri noted, Republicans David Medina and Eva Guzman were each elected to the Supreme Court. Medina and Guzman, both initially appointed by GOP Gov. Rick Perry, won election in 2006 and 2010, respectively, according to election results from 1992 through 2010 posted online by the Texas secretary of state’s office. Both are currently on the nine-person court.

Carrillo attempted to win another term last year, but lost his party’s nomination to David Porter of Giddings, who went on to win the seat. After the primary, Carrillo said his Hispanic surname doomed him, writing supporters: ""Early polling showed that the typical GOP primary voter has very little info about the position of Railroad Commissioner, what we do, or who my opponent or I were. Given the choice between 'Porter' and 'Carrillo' — unfortunately, the Hispanic surname was a serious setback from which I could never recover although I did all in my power to overcome this built-in bias,"" according to a March 3, 2010, news article in the Austin American-Statesman. That article also quoted an unidentified Republican official saying Carrillo tumbled because he didn’t energetically campaign.

Notably, too, Latino candidates have occasionally been appointed to statewide offices only to lose at the polls. The late Lena Guerrero, an Austin Democrat, lost her 1992 bid to remain on the Texas Railroad Commission to Republican Barry Williamson. In 2002, Republican Xavier Rodriguez, appointed to the Supreme Court by Gov. Rick Perry, was defeated in his party’s primary by little-known Stephen Wayne Smith.

Also, Texas Democrats have nominated multiple Latinos for statewide posts who went on to lose, in great part because Republicans have won every statewide contest since 1996. Defeated Democratic nominees include Senate nominees Victor Morales and Rick Noriega, gubernatorial aspirant Tony Sanchez, land commissioner nominees Richard Raymond and Hector Uribe, Supreme Court nominees Margaret Mirabal and Linda Yanez and four-time Court of Criminal Appeals nominee JR Molina.

Side note: Perry named Elsa Alcala to the Court of Criminal Appeals in May 2011 to a term through 2012. She has filed her candidacy for election next year to a full six-year term.

So, the tally comes out to five Republican Hispanics elected statewide and two Democrats.

End of story?

Not entirely. Munisteri’s omits some important context about Texas politics: No Democrat, regardless of ethnicity, has won statewide office for 15 years. Put another way, no Latino Republicans won statewide until after every statewide Republican nominee started prevailing.Conversely, Democrats weren’t electing many Hispanics when they dominated Texas politics, either.

"['Georgia', 'Criminal Justice', 'City of Atlanta']","
City: Criminal database lacks some Atlanta warrants
","
The handling of a police traffic stop involving Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed’s brother raises questions about power, politics and ethics.  

What has the Truth-O-Meter spinning is a more practical concern: crime databases.

When police stopped Tracy Reed on Oct. 28, he had an open warrant for failing to appear at a traffic court hearing three weeks earlier.

Reed could have been arrested on the spot. Yet when an officer ran his name in the Atlanta Police Department’s criminal database, the warrant never popped up. A police major let Reed go.

This was no fluke, according to a recent city of Atlanta news release about its internal investigation on the stop. Police may rely upon the Atlanta Criminal Information Center database to find out whether someone has a warrant, but in certain cases, it can’t tell them.

""Atlanta Municipal Court bench warrants are not included in the Atlanta Criminal Information Center [ACIC] database,"" the Nov. 28 release said. Bench warrants are arrest warrants initiated by a judge, often when people fail to appear in court.

We PolitiFact Georgia scribes squinted our eyes and read the sentence twice. If these arrest warrants aren’t in the system, how do police know whom to haul to jail?

We talked to Atlanta police, reviewed existing policies and statutes, contacted court officials, and looked at investigative reports to find some answers. And yes, there is a hole in the city’s criminal database.

In case you missed the controversy, Reed ran into trouble Oct. 28 after an Atlanta police officer stopped him for driving with an expired tag, according to a city internal investigation. Even though Reed drove with a license suspended since 2006, the patrolman’s superior let the mayor’s brother go.
Running a criminal history database is a complex operation. The information is sensitive and the stakes are high. If the people who enter the data get it wrong or don’t enter it in time, an officer might come face to face with a dangerous felon and not even know it. A person could be jailed for a crime he didn’t commit.

That means police can’t do something as simple as make a phone call or send an email to put a warrant in the system, state and local law enforcement officials told us. Only specially certified employees may enter the information into the computer, and they may do so only after receiving the proper documentation.    

When Atlanta police obtain warrants as part of their investigations, agency policy gives investigating officers 12 hours to hand-deliver the paperwork to the APD team that updates the criminal database.

But when an Atlanta municipal judge issues a warrant because someone fails to appear in court, no one hands this paperwork over for entry in the city’s database, police spokesman Carlos Campos told PolitiFact.  

In fact, these bench warrants are not entered into any local, state or national database, according to the city’s investigative report.

Georgia law doesn’t require it, said Shirley Andrews, who helps run the state’s criminal database for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The state attorney general designates what minor offenses must be in the system. Bench warrants for failing to appear in Municipal Court are not on it.

This is a problem, Atlanta Police Chief George Turner told investigators.

""[T]he truth is, there are thousands of folks that are warranted by Municipal Court warrants. But there’s no way, not to my knowledge, on how to deal with it,"" Turner said, according to a transcript of his interview.  

The head of a state professional organization for prosecutors said he has heard that other jurisdictions are wrestling with the issue.

Officers or dispatchers could telephone the Atlanta court to check for open warrants, Turner told investigators, but it’s closed on Friday, the day Reed was stopped.

Police and court officials told PolitiFact they’ve been working on this problem for months but need funding to solve it.

Atlanta Municipal Court bench warrants are not included in the ACIC database, as the city’s news release said. In fact, Atlanta’s police chief estimates that thousands of people with open warrants aren’t in there.

"['Ohio', 'Taxes', 'John Boehner']","
House Speaker John Boehner says it costs Americans $500 billion to comply with the tax code
","
As the deadline neared last month for the congressional ""supercommittee"" on deficit reduction, House Speaker John Boehner defended a proposal by GOP members against criticism that it broke the party's pledge on taxes.

The proposal called for higher tax revenues in exchange for lowered tax rates. Boehner called it a ""fair offer"" that would begin reform of the tax code, to ""make America more competitive and produce more economic growth.""

""It's important for us to reform the tax code,"" the Ohio Republican told reporters. ""We've got a personal tax system that's so complicated it costs Americans about $500 billion a year to comply with the current tax code.""

That statement rang a bell for PolitiFact Ohio, and we decided to take a look.

The claim is similar to a remark Texas Gov. Rick Perry made Oct. 28, 2011, during the New Hampshire speech that became famous for its animated banter and went viral online.

""You know, we spend half a trillion dollars a year in tax preparation,"" he said. ""Any accountants or tax lawyers out there -- I'm sorry, dude, but that's too much money, a half a trillion dollars.""

PolitiFact took a look at Perry’s statement, starting with a 2005 paper by the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax issues. Boehner’s staff acknowledged that was their source for the information, just as did Perry’s campaign staff.

The paper noted at least three burdens caused by the tax code: tax planning, or efforts to limit one’s taxes; defending against tax audits and tax litigation; and tax compliance, which includes record-keeping, education about tax laws, form preparation and packaging and sending tax forms.

The foundation decided to look only at the third category, tax compliance, for 2005. Its researchers concluded that the costs of compliance for individuals was 2.8 billion hours, or $110 billion; the cost for businesses was 3.1 billion hours or $148 billion; and the cost for nonprofits was 141 million hours or $6.8 billion.

Where did those figures come from?

To estimate the cost of compliance for individual filings, the Tax Foundation used the weighted average compensation rate of individuals who prepare their own returns and of those who hire tax professionals.

The report used an hourly compensation rate for individuals -- estimated at $23.75 nationally for 2004, the latest year available. For tax returns prepared by tax professionals, the foundation said it used the average compensation rate for tax accountants.   

For business filings, the average compensation cost was the hourly rate for the average tax accountant, $45.37.

Data about the time spent on tax returns came from the Internal Revenue Service, the report said. It found that Form 1040—which accounts for almost half of the compliance cost borne by individuals—takes 13.6 hours to complete.

The total cost of compliance was estimated as than 6 billion hours and nearly $265 billion -- a figure that the Tax Foundation called ""staggering,"" but is still significantly lower than the estimate from both Perry and Boehner.

But not all of that is money that changed hands, meaning it was not all money that was spent. That’s significant, because it raises the question of whether you can call it a cost, as Boehner did.

Consider the case of the individual who prepares his own return. The individual expends a certain number of hours on record keeping, learning how to prepare the return and the actual preparation and filing of the return. But an individual completing his own return does not pay himself for that time.

The Tax Foundation report, as do other estimates of compliance cost, puts a value on that time. That’s where the hourly compensation figures come into play.

""Some may argue that individuals would value their time more or less highly than their hourly salary rate since it is their leisure time (time not spent in formal work) that is given up to file taxes. However, to avoid speculation, the Tax Foundation believes that the hourly compensation rate represents the best estimate of a compliance cost level for individuals,"" the report says.

The same paper projected that compliance costs would rise by 2015 to $483 billion -- or $406 billion adjusted for the 2005 value of the dollar.

But PolitiFact found that the figure was an overstatement of today’s cost. Using the same study’s projections, the amount for 2011 should be $392 billion, or $354 billion in 2005 dollars. 
PolitiFact also checked a 2005 report from The Government Accountability Office.

""Estimating total compliance costs is difficult because neither the government nor taxpayers maintain regular accounts of these costs, and federal tax requirements often overlap with record-keeping and reporting that taxpayers do for other purposes,"" the GAO wrote. ""Although available estimates are uncertain, taken together, they suggest that total compliance costs are large. For example, combining the lowest available estimates for the personal and corporate income tax yields a total of $107 billion per year.""

Other studies, GAO added, estimate costs as 1.5 times as large.

Finally, PolitiFact checked in with Eric Toder, a fellow at the Urban Institute who has studied tax compliance costs. He estimated that current compliance costs for all individual filers is about $100 billion, plus nearly another $100 billion for small businesses, plus an undetermined amount for nonprofits and large businesses. Added together, this is likely a bit lower than the Tax Foundation’s projected 2011 figure of $392 billion and significantly lower than the $500 billion figure.

Boehner, as did Perry, made a valid point -- that a whole lot of money is spent on tax preparation in the United States today. But their numbers are not close to accurate, and a huge part of the dollar cost they mention is not money that anyone actually spends. Rather, it is the value placed on the time people take for  preparation.

Michele Bachmann says former Mass. Gov. Mitt Romney 'put into place socialized medicine'
","
Hey, Massachusetts, did you know you've got socialized medicine?

Michele Bachmann said so at the Dec. 10, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Iowa. 
""If you look at Mitt Romney as the governor of Massachusetts, he's the only governor that put into place socialized medicine,"" she said, making the case that she's the only ""proven constitutional conservative"" in the race for the GOP nomination.

Is that true? Did Romney, as governor, ""put into place socialized medicine""?

What Bachmann said

Bachmann mentioned ""socialized medicine"" more than once in the Iowa debate, once referring to her fight against ""Obamacare."" (""Our country was going to lose because of socialized medicine."")

Earlier, she marshaled the phrase to attack Romney during a short speech against the dangers of ""Newt Romney.""

Texas Rep. Ron Paul railed against Newt Gingrich for lacking conservative consistency and taking taxpayer money as a consultant for Freddie Mac. Debate moderator George Stephanopoulos invited Bachman to jump in: 
Was Romney's state health care law ""socialized medicine""?

'Socialized medicine' vs. Romneycare

The phrase ""socialized medicine"" refers to health systems where the government owns and operates delivery and financing of health care, according to Princeton economics professor Uwe E. Reinhardt.

Dictionary definitions are somewhat broader, such as Merriam-Webster's definition that ""medical and hospital services for the members of a class or population administered by an organized group (as a state agency) and paid for from funds obtained usually by assessments, philanthropy, or taxation.""

But in context, the idea is the same. In a socialized medical system in the state of Massachusetts, the government would administer medical services using tax dollars. That's the way, for example, that the military and Veterans Administration operate.

PolitiFact has regularly explored details of Romney's health care law, especially as it compares with the federal health care law signed by President Barack Obama.

As PolitiFact writer Angie Drobnic Holan has written, both leave in place the major insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. They seek to reduce the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and by offering tax breaks to help moderate income people buy insurance. People are required to buy insurance or pay a penalty, a mechanism called the ""individual mandate."" And companies that don't offer insurance have to pay fines, with exceptions for small business and a few other cases.

The key here is that Romney's plan left in place private employer-provided insurance. 

Here's some greater detail on Romney's plan from previous PolitiFact work. Notice the focus on private health insurance, employer-provided insurance and the private insurance market. Even with Medicaid, in which the government pays for care, it doesn't provide it: 
• Individual mandate to buy health insurance. Everyone in Massachusetts must purchase health insurance or else pay a penalty; the same goes for the federal plan, though the penalty structures vary between the two.

• Employer responsibilities for offering health insurance. Companies with more than 10 employees in Massachusetts are required to offer health insurance or pay a penalty. The federal law sets the requirement for companies at 50 employees.

• Health insurance exchanges. Both the Massachusetts and national plans involve the use of voluntary ""exchanges"" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. The exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premiums.

• Affordability subsidies. Under both plans, lower-income individuals and families can receive government subsidies to help them pay health insurance premiums. In the Massachusetts plan, subsidies are allotted on a decreasing scale up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Under the national plan, the sliding-scale subsidies go up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level.

• Expansion of Medicaid. The Massachusetts plan expands Medicaid to all children up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. The federal plan also expands Medicaid, but in a different fashion, offering it to all individuals (not just children) up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level.

• Insurance market regulation. Both plans restructure the insurance market, in similar but slightly different ways. They handle the individual and small-group markets differently. In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 can be covered on their parents' plan, while the federal law allows such dependent coverage up to age 26. 

We asked Bachmann's campaign for support for her claim but didn't hear back.

Our ruling

""Socialized medicine,"" describes some health systems in place in the United States, such as those for veterans and active-duty military. But changes to Massachusetts health care under Romney don't begin to approach government-paid and government-provided care. The Massachusetts plan relies, in fact, on the same private employer-based health insurance system most Americans are familiar with. That's so different from ""socialized medicine"" — practically the other end of the public-private spectrum — that Bachmann's use of the label is, frankly, ridiculous. We rate her statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F63A40>],/factchecks/2011/dec/11/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-former-mass-gov-mitt-romney-/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'States', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says Mitt Romney's book deleted line that Mass. health care law ""should be the model for the country""
","
Rick Perry was smart to say he's not in the betting business.

Mitt Romney's $10,000 health care wager at a Republican presidential debate in Iowa on Dec. 10, 2011 had pundits declaring him ""rich, elite, and out of touch."" (""Romney bombed with a bet""!)

But was he right on the merits? 
The subject of bet-worthy disagreement was well-worn territory: The Texas governor declared that Romney's book No Apology called his Massachusetts health care law ""the model for the country,"" including its individual mandate that people buy health insurance.

That is, until the line was deleted from a later version of the book, Perry said.

Perry kept up the familiar refrain on the next day's Fox News Sunday: 

""The issue of individual mandates is still at the center here, and Mitt can deny this as many times as he wants, but in his first book, hardcover, of No Apologies, he clearly stated that individual mandate should be the model for this country. And then he took that out of the book, in the paperback, and that's the fact, and even a $10,000 bet is not gonna cover that.""

PolitiFact has peeked into Perry's book claims before, so we were ready to rule on this one.

The exchange 
In a September debate, Perry accused Romney of removing a line that the Massachusetts health care law was exactly what the American people needed. We found that claim Mostly False.

In this debate, Perry focused his rhetoric on the ""individual mandate"" — a controversial requirement of President Barack Obama's federal health care law that everyone buy health insurance. It was also part of Romney's state health care law.

Perry said that both Romney and Newt Gingrich ""have been for the individual mandate.""

Romney fired back that ""as (House) speaker, Gingrich said that he was for a federal individual mandate. That's something I've always opposed. What we did in our state was designed by the people in our state for the needs of our state. You believe in the 10th Amendment. I believe in the 10th Amendment.""

Soon, the wager war broke out:

PERRY: ""Well, I'm listening to you, Mitt, and I'm hearing you say all the right things. But I read your first book, and it said in there that your mandate in Massachusetts, which should be the model for the country -- and I know it came out of the reprint of the book, but, you know, I'm just saying, you were for individual mandates, my friend.""

ROMNEY: ""You know what, you've raised that before, Rick. And you're simply wrong.""

PERRY: ""It was true then ..."" 

ROMNEY: ""No, no ...""

PERRY: ""And it's true now.""

ROMNEY: ""Rick, I'll tell you what ...""

(LAUGHTER)

ROMNEY: ""... 10,000 bucks? $10,000 bet?""

PERRY: ""I'm not in the betting business ...""

ROMNEY: ""Oh, okay.""

PERRY: ""... but I'll show you the""

ROMNEY: ""I wrote the ...""

PERRY: ""I'll show you the book.""

ROMNEY: ""I've got the book and ...""

(LAUGHTER)

ROMNEY: ""And I wrote the book. And I have it. And Chapter 7, there's a section called ""The Massachusetts Model,"" and I say as close, as I can quote, I say, in my view, each state should be able to fashion their own program for the specific needs of their distinct citizens.

""And then I go on to talk about the states being the laboratories of democracy, and we can learn from one another. I have not said in that book, first edition or the latest edition, anything about our plan being a national model imposed on the nation. The right course for America -- and I've said this during the debates last time around; I'll say it now and time again -- is to let individual states -- this is a remarkable nation. This idea of federalism is so extraordinary. Let states craft their own solutions. Don't have ObamaCare put on us by the federal government."" 
Who got it right, Perry or Romney?

What the books say

Perry's grievance is with differences between hardcover and paperback editions of Romney's book. We've combed through Chapter 7 of both.

Romney's changes to the book have been explored before, by Boston political journalist David S. Bernstein. He noted in February 2011 that Romney had added harsher language on the national health care law as passed: ""Obamacare will not work and should be repealed,"" and, ""Obamacare is an unconstitutional federal incursion into the rights of states.""

Romney more clearly explained ways that he disagreed with implementation of the Massachusetts law.

He also changed this line, which came after a paragraph touting the success of the Massachusetts health plan:

Hardcover: ""We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country, and it can be done without letting government take over health care.""

To:

Paperback: ""And it was done without government taking over health care.""

The deleted 11 words, ""We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country"" are the crux of Perry's argument. His campaign sent e-mail the day after the debate with a link highlighting precisely that change.

It looks suspicious, right? Perhaps Romney did extol every piece of his Massachusetts plan, individual mandate and all, for every state in the union.

But here's the original quote with full context from Page 177 of the hardcover:  
Romney's not really saying the Massachusetts law ""should be the model for the country,"" the way that Perry describes it. He's in fact presenting a defense of state-level choice. It's like a shout-out to other state leaders: Hey, you can have what Massachusetts has!

And it's consistent with what Romney fired back at Perry in the Sept. 22, 2011 debate: ""This is a state plan for a state, it is not a national plan."" And with how he characterized his own book in the most recent debate: ""I say, in my view, each state should be able to fashion their own program for the specific needs of their distinct citizens.""

Romney did support Massachusetts' individual mandate. But we don't see evidence in his hardcover book that he supported a federal one, much less that he removed such a reference from later editions.

Our ruling

Perry's right that Romney's comments about health care were edited between editions. Among other things, a line that advocated the Massachusetts model as a strong option for other states was replaced by a shorter, more generic sentence. But that line was preceded by an argument for state-level solutions, exactly the argument Romney extends now. That's not how Perry characterized it. So he did win that bet — by not betting.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Michele Bachmann']","
Michele Bachmann says Newt Gingrich backed individual mandate in 1993, 2011
","
During a Republican presidential debate on Dec. 10, 2011, in Des Moines, Iowa, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., took aim at one of her rivals, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, for his past support for an individual mandate for health insurance -- the government requirement for individuals to buy health insurance. It’s a central provision at issue in the legal challenges to President Barack Obama’s health care law. 
In 1993, Bachmann said, Gingrich ""first advocated for the individual mandate in health care. And as recently as May of this year, he was still advocating for the individual mandate in health care."" 
Readers asked us to check the claim, so we did. 
Gingrich appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press on Oct. 3, 1993, at a time when the Clinton administration was trying to pass a health-care overhaul. On the May 15, 2011, edition of Meet the Press, host David Gregory replayed a clip from Gingrich’s 1993 appearance that addressed the individual mandate. 
""I am for people, individuals -- exactly like automobile insurance -- individuals having health insurance and being required to have health insurance. And I am prepared to vote for a voucher system which will give individuals, on a sliding scale, a government subsidy so we insure that everyone as individuals have health insurance."" 
That seems pretty clear, but we wanted to locate further context to make sure. We couldn’t locate the full transcript, but we did find a partial transcript excerpted in a Washington Times report: 
Q: Do you support compulsory national health care? 
A: Not at all. ... (The president's plan) is a monstrosity. I mean, after all the nice speeches, after all the nice testimony, the fact is, when you read the president's plan, it has got to be the most destructively big-government plan ever proposed. … That's how he gets the money -- by coercing change in order to pay for his plan. Without coercion, this plan collapses, and with coercion, it, frankly, is a remarkable bill to be offered to an American nation. 
Q: Are you for compulsory automobile insurance? 
A: I would like to see us go much closer to (Texas Republican Sen.) Phil Gramm's model. I would like to see every American have health insurance. I am willing to require that. I'd much rather do it through an individual voucher, much like an earned-income tax credit, rather than do it through an employer mandate that will kill jobs. But that's not the issue here. You can pass a requirement, and you can find a way to give what is actually less than 8 percent of the American people health insurance without having to go to the total overhaul of American health care, turning it all into a giant bureaucratic mess with a centralized board in Washington appointed by politicians. 
The full context makes Gingrich seem somewhat more flexible about the details, but ultimately he did say, ""I would like to see every American have health insurance. I am willing to require that."" 
What about the claim that Gingrich was advocating for the individual mandate as recently as May 2011 -- a point well after virtually all mainstream Republicans had come out against such a requirement? 
Here, too, the venue was Meet the Press, the May 15, 2011 edition. After Gregory played the 1993 clip, here’s the conversation: 
Gregory: ""What you advocate there is precisely what President Obama did with his health care legislation, is it not?"" 
Ginrgich: ""No, it's not precisely what he did. In, in the first place, Obama basically is trying to replace the entire insurance system, creating state exchanges, building a Washington - based model, creating a federal system. I believe all of us -- and this is going to be a big debate -- I believe all of us have a responsibility to help pay for health care . I think the idea that..."" 
Gregory: ""You agree with Mitt Romney on this point."" 
Gingrich: ""Well, I agree that all of us have a responsibility to pay -- help pay for health care . And, and I think that there are ways to do it that make most libertarians relatively happy. I've said consistently we ought to have some requirement that you either have health insurance or you post a bond...."" 
Gregory: ""Mm-hmm."" 
Gingrich: ""...or in some way you indicate you’ll be held accountable."" 
Gregory: ""But that is the individual mandate, is it not?"" 
Gingrich: ""It's a variation on it."" 
Gregory: ""OK."" 
Gingrich: ""But it's a system …"" 
Gregory: ""And so you won't use that issue against Mitt Romney."" 
Gingrich: ""No. But it's a system which allows people to have a range of choices which are designed by the economy. But I think setting the precedent -- you know, there are an amazing number of people who think that they ought to be given health care. And, and so a large number of the uninsured earn $75,000 or more a year, don't buy any health insurance because they want to buy a second house or a better car or go on vacation. And then you and I and everybody else ends up picking up for them. I don't think having a free rider system in health is any more appropriate than having a free rider system in any other part of our society."" 
This exchange became so controversial in Republican circles that Gingrich felt the need to personally walk back his comment the following day. 
""I am completely opposed to the Obamacare mandate on individuals,"" he said in a video. ""I fought it for two and half years at the Center for Health Transformation. You can see all the things we did to stop it at HealthTransformation.net. I am for the repeal of Obamacare and I am against any effort to impose a federal mandate on anyone because it is fundamentally wrong and I believe unconstitutional."" 
We understand Gingrich’s desire to restate his opposition to the individual mandate, given how deeply opposed Republican voters are to the idea. But was what Gingrich said in the 2011 Meet the Press interview really ""advocating for the individual mandate in health care,"" as Bachmann said in the Des Moines debate? 
Not quite. 
Gingrich calls it a ""variation"" on the individual mandate -- the idea that people take responsibility for their health care, either by purchasing health insurance or by posting a bond to pay for any health care they may eventually need. 
It’s not the first time Gingrich advocated a choice between a mandate and a bond. For instance, in a June 25, 2007, column titled, ""Covering the uninsured -- do we want markets or mandates?"" Gingrich wrote, ""In order to make coverage more accessible, Congress must do more, including passing legislation to … require anyone who earns more than $50,000 a year to purchase health insurance or post a bond."" 
Working out the details of a bond system -- such as how much would need to be set aside and how -- poses challenges. But it’s conceivable that the legal challenges to Obama’s health care law, which are based on the notion that the government cannot compel Americans to buy a commercial product, might be less likely to succeed if the law had offered the bond option. 
""A bond alternative was part of the Heritage Foundation's plan and was actually originally in Romney's proposal in Massachusetts but was taken out by legislature late in game,"" said Michael Tanner, a health policy specialist with the libertarian Cato Institute. ""It is a modest improvement over a straight mandate since it doesn't require you to buy a specific product, but libertarians like me still found it objectionable."" 
Still, in our view, the fact that Gingrich supported the bond idea in the 2011 Meet the Press interview muddies the waters enough to weaken the argument Bachmann made -- that ""as recently as May of this year, he was still advocating for the individual mandate in health care."" 
Our ruling 
In the 1993 interview, Gingrich advocated for individuals ""being required to have health insurance,"" though he expressed flexibility on the details. That makes the first half of Bachmann’s claim correct. In the 2011 interview, Gingrich said ""we ought to have some requirement that you either have health insurance or you post a bond."" It’s an exaggeration to say that this equates to advocating for an individual mandate, since he posed it as one of two acceptable options. On balance, we rate Bachmann’s statement Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F144C0>],/factchecks/2011/dec/11/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-newt-gingrich-backed-individ/

New Jersey’s unemployment benefits fund is broke, with more than $1 billion owed to the federal government
","
New Jersey has gone into debt to cover unemployment benefits for people who lost their jobs in the Garden State.

Assemblyman Jay Webber (R-Morris) made that argument in a recent NJToday interview about his opposition to proposed legislation aimed at providing unemployment benefits to certain individuals whose hours at work have been reduced.

""It might be a good idea. The problem I have is that our unemployment insurance trust fund is broke,"" Webber said during the Nov. 28 interview. ""We're over a billion dollars in debt to the federal government, and what this bill does is create another stream of income out of the fund.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Webber is right.

After more than two and a half years of borrowing money to cover unemployment benefits, New Jersey still owed about $1.3 billion to the federal government as of Dec. 6, according to federal and state officials.

Kerri Gatling, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, said the state expects to pay off the loan in late 2013.

""There is currently a negative fund balance resulting from the severe economic downturn whereby unemployment insurance benefit payments exceed contributions to the fund,"" Gatling said in an email.

Webber told us the fund must be protected and its solvency ensured.

""Regardless of how we got there, now we’ve got to fix it,"" Webber said.

Here’s how we got into so much debt:

New Jersey’s unemployment insurance trust fund is made up of payroll taxes paid by employers and employees. The fund is used to pay unemployment benefits to people who worked in New Jersey.

The idea behind such trust funds is to build up reserves when the economy is performing well in order to pay unemployment benefits during economic downturns.

But state officials repeatedly diverted money from the trust fund to cover charity care payments to hospitals, ultimately reaching a total of about $4.6 billion in funds by 2005, according to the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services.

Then, as more people lost their jobs during the recent recession and sought unemployment benefits, the trust fund was depleted by March 2009 and the state began borrowing from the federal government to cover the payments, according to OLS.

The borrowing reached its height in April 2011, when New Jersey owed $2.1 billion for the loan, Gatling said. On Sept. 30, New Jersey paid nearly $48 million to the federal government to cover interest on the loan, she said.

The state anticipates an interest payment of between roughly $55 million and $60 million to be made in September 2012, Gatling said.

""As we minimize the interest expense, we take excess funds and pay the loan balance,"" Gatling said. ""Payroll taxes are used to pay benefits and pay the loan balance.""

In November 2010, New Jersey voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment prohibiting the diversion of money from the unemployment insurance trust fund and other benefit funds for any other purposes.

But New Jersey isn’t the only state that owes the federal government money to cover unemployment benefits.

As of Dec. 6, 27 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands owed a total of roughly $38.3 billion in principal alone, including New Jersey’s roughly $1.3 billion, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. California owes the most, about $9.4 billion, according to the department.

Our ruling

Webber claimed in a television interview that New Jersey’s ""unemployment insurance trust fund is broke. We're over a billion dollars in debt to the federal government.""

The assemblyman’s statement is on target. New Jersey currently owes more than $1 billion to the federal government for money borrowed to pay unemployment benefits.

We rate the statement True.

Chain e-mail claims top executives of veterans organizations receive no pay for their good deeds

If this is the time of year when you open your checkbook to make donations to worthy causes, an anonymous e-mail making the rounds has some suggestions for you.

It lists nine organizations and the compensation each top officer received.

The CEO of UNICEF, the fund to help children around the world, is listed as having the largest salary: $1.2 million per year, plus a Rolls Royce, plus expenses, for an organization the e-mail claims spends ""less than 5 cents of your donated dollar"" on its mission.

The heads of other charitable organizations are listed as having sizable salaries as well. By contrast, the e-mail lists five veterans groups and says the national commander of each ""receives a $0.00 zero salary."" (You can see the text of the e-mail on various websites, including here and here.)

Remember, the heads of all these groups are supposedly working for free.

AMERICAN LEGION: The group's national adjutant, Daniel S. Wheeler earned $201,661 in salary and other compensation, according to the organization's 990 form from 2009. Unlike the other organizations we examined, the Legion failed to fill out the form breaking down how much it spent on fundraising and administrative costs. But the Better Business Bureau, in its analysis released in February 2010, found that, of the $63 million it spent, 45 cents out of every dollar went for fundraising and administrative costs. The organization failed to meet 11 of the Better Business Bureau's 20 standards of accountability.

DISABLED AMERICAN VETERANS: National Adjutant and CEO Arthur H. Wilson earned $328,252 in compensation, according to the organization's 990 report for 2009. Of the $124 million in expenses, 30 cents of every dollar was spent on fundraising and administrative costs. The organization met all of the BBB's standards for charity accountability.

VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS OF THE UNITED STATES: VFW Adjutant General Allen F. Kent earned $215,822, according to the organization's 990 report from 2009. The organization's quartermaster general earned nearly $24,000 more than Kent in compensation. Three other top officials also earned more than $211,000. With nearly $85 million in expenses, 36 cents of each dollar was spent on administration and fundraising. The Better Business Bureau could not rate this organization because it failed to release enough information to the BBB.

MILITARY ORDER OF THE PURPLE HEART SERVICE FOUNDATION (listed in the e-mail as The Military Order of Purple Hearts): Executive Director Gregory Bresser received $142,986 in compensation in 2009, and that was only for part of the year. He left the post in August. CFO Stephen Ruckman got $150,626, according to the 990 filing for 2009. The group listed nearly $34 million in expenses and spent a whopping 63 cents per dollar on fundraising and administrative costs. The BBB could not rate this organization either because it did not supply enough information.

VIETNAM VETERANS OF AMERICA (The e-mail listed the Vietnam Veterans Association, which we couldn’t find. This organization was the closest match.): Chief financial officer and staff director Joseph Sternburg earned $137,902 in compensation, according to its 990 report from 2009. According to the form, the organization has $7 million in expenses and spent 33 cents per dollar on fundraising and administration. When the BBB reviewed the organization, in March of 2010, the rate was 75 cents per dollar -- the highest rate we saw. The business bureau said the group failed to meet 10 of the 20 standards of accountability.

We also checked the other organizations that the e-mail was comparing the veterans organizations to.

AMERICAN RED CROSS: The e-mail says the CEO makes $651,957, which actually is an understatement. President and CEO Gail McGovern earned more than $1 million in compensation, according to the organization's 990 form for 2009, which says she typically worked 60 hours per week. The charity spent $3.4 billion; fundraising and administrative costs ate up just 8 cents of every dollar. The latest BBB rating says the organization met all of its accountability standards.

UNITED WAY WORLDWIDE: The e-mail says President and CEO Brian A. Gallagher makes $375,000, but the organization's financial report says he made $717,076 in income and other compensation for 2009. (Its chief operating officer earned the most: $864,875.) Fundraising and administrative costs accounted for 11 cents of every dollar spent. The BBB says the charity met all 20 of its standards of accountability. (Anthony Maione, CEO of United Way of Rhode Island, received $211,378 in compensation, according to the organization's 2009 report.)

THE SALVATION ARMY is not required to report complete 990 financial data because it is largely a religious organization. One quarter of the money raised by the four Salvation Armies that cover different sectors of the United States goes to the national office, which supplied data to the BBB to get its certification, according to Salvation Army spokesman Maj. George Hood.

National Commander William A. Roberts receives $126,920 in compensation (not $13,000 per year plus housing as the e-mail reports). That salary is shared with his wife, who also works for the organization. The organization logged $51 million in expenses; 15 cents per dollar went for fundraising and administrative costs. (Total expenses for all of its affiliate organizations was $3.2 billion, with 18 percent going for fundraising and administrative costs.)

UNITED STATES FUND FOR UNICEF: The e-mail says CEO Carly M. Stern's compensation is $1.2 million. It was actually $472,891, according to its 2009 report. The e-mail says only 5 cents of every dollar ""goes to the cause;"" it's really 83 cents. The amount spent on fundraising and administrative costs: 17 cents per dollar, out of a budget of $243 million. The BBB says the charity met all 20 of its standards of accountability.

Our ruling

To be charitable, the only thing this e-mail got right was the names of some of the top officers. Everything else was wildly off. 
Here's the summary: 
  

First, the suggestion made in the e-mail that top officials in five veterans groups are working for free turns out to be outlandishly false. All are making six-figure incomes. 
Top officials in three of the non-veteran organizations earn a lot more than stated in the e-mail. In one case, they make a lot less.

The e-mail incorrectly states -- in the case of UNICEF, wildly misstates -- the amount the charities spend on charitable work.

Because the e-mail is ridiculously inaccurate, we give it a free Pants on Fire!

Donald Trump says goods trade deficit was almost $800 billion in 2015
","Yanking back international trade is a cornerstone of Donald Trump’s bid for the presidency. He believes other countries benefit from our trade practices, while the United States suffers. The trade deficit is how much more goods and services the United States imports than it exports, Trump says it’s too high. ""Our trade deficit in goods reached nearly — think of this, think of this — our trade deficit is $800 billion last year alone,"" Trump said in July 21 remarks at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. ""We’re gonna fix that."" Trump’s phrasing is a little off, but he’s got the idea right. The country’s overall trade deficit in 2015 was about $500 billion, according to Census data, but that figure includes both goods and services. Trump mentioned the trade deficit in goods, which includes all manufactured products, oil and agriculture products. The trade deficit in 2015 for just goods was $763 billion. Not quite $800 billion, but reasonably close. The reason the overall trade deficit is smaller than just the goods trade deficit is because the United States exports more services than it imports. This isn’t the highest the goods trade deficit has ever been. It ranged from $782 billion in 2005 to $832 billion in 2008. It’s possible, however, that current figures actually understate the size of the goods trade deficit because oil prices have been abnormally low, said Robert Scott, director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank supported in part by unions. ""It’s a large deficit,"" Scott said. ""And it needs to be reduced."" Our ruling Trump said, ""Our trade deficit in goods reached nearly … $800 billion last year alone."" In 2015, the goods trade deficit was $763 billion. Trump is pretty close.

Donald Trump's largely accurate about Clinton's past support for NAFTA, TPP
","At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Donald Trump repeated his months-long criticism of Hillary Clinton’s past support of free trade deals, a position in stark contrast to his own. (Trump says his superior negotiating skills will result in better deals.) ""She supported (the North American Free Trade Agreement), and she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization — another one of her husband’s colossal mistakes. She supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea. She supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership."" This is largely accurate, but it’s worth noting that Clinton no longer supports NAFTA or TPP, nor is it clear that the South Korean deal is a job-killer. Let’s go through Clinton’s position on these deals one by one. NAFTA As first lady, Clinton spoke favorably of NAFTA — the North American Free Trade Agreement — signed by President Bill Clinton. ""I think everybody is in favor of free and fair trade. I think NAFTA is proving its worth,"" said Clinton, according to a 1996 Associated Press report. ""Creating a free trade zone in North America — the largest free trade zone in the world — would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization,"" she wrote in her 2003 memoir, Living History, which the Trump campaign cited in a press release. ""Although unpopular with labor unions, expanding trade opportunities was an important administration goal."" But a few years later, she changed her position on the deal during her first White House bid. In 2007, she called NAFTA a ""mistake"" and said it ""hurt a lot of American workers."" Why the change of heart? According to the 2008 Clinton camp, she was always skeptical of the deal. But the first lady was ""not supposed to deviate from the position of the administration,"" Robert Shapiro, the undersecretary of commerce under Bill Clinton, told the Huffington Post. China’s inclusion in the WTO While campaigning for Senate in 2000, Clinton voiced reservations about China’s entrance into the WTO, but was supportive overall. Here’s what she said at a CNN forum in April of that year, which was cited by the Trump campaign: ""I share the concerns that many of my supporters in organized labor have expressed to me, because I do think we have to make sure that we improve labor rights, we improve environmental standards in our bilateral and our multilateral trade agreements. But on balance, I've looked at this, I've studied it, I think it is in the interests of America and American workers that we provide the option for China to go into the WTO. Right now, we are trading with China. We have a huge trade deficit with China. The agreement that has been negotiated between our two countries would open their markets to us in a way that they are not yet open, and in fact, for many large manufactured products, like automobiles, we would have the first chance to really get in and compete in that marketplace."" (According to news reports from 1999, then-Reform Party member Trump opposed the United States’ inclusion in the WTO, period.) China became a member of the WTO in December 2001, with the support of President George W. Bush. Since then, Clinton hasn’t reversed her position, as far as we can tell, but has advocated for using the WTO to bring trade cases against China. (This is also Trump’s current position.) Deal with South Korea During her 2008 presidential run, Clinton opposed a pending free trade deal with South Korea (as well as other deals with Colombia and Panama). ""While I value the strong relationship the United States enjoys with South Korea, I believe that this agreement is inherently unfair,"" she told the AFL-CIO in June 2007. ""The South Korean agreement does not create a level playing field for American carmakers,"" she said in a November 2007 campaign statement. But as secretary of state, she supported the deal advocated by the administration. At an April 2011 gathering of business leaders in Seoul, Clinton said the deal was ""profoundly in America's strategic interest"" and ""a priority for me, for President Obama and for the entire administration."" (In 2008, Obama also was against the deal.) When the deal entered into force in March 2012, Clinton touted it as a ""historic milestone"" that will ""provide a significant economic boost to both of our economies"" and ""strengthen the U.S. partnership with a key ally in a strategically important region."" Does this deal kill jobs, as Trump says? The jury is still out. On one hand, the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-focused think tank, which Trump has cited, has found that the South Korean deal cost about 60,000 U.S. jobs. On the other, the Obama administration has argued the deal actually creates jobs. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact-Checker, meanwhile, looked at the the evidence and found both estimates of job losses and job gains are fishy. An independent analysis by economists at Tufts University and the University of Michigan projected a decline in manufacturing and service jobs and an increase in agriculture and food, beverage and tobacco jobs. But overall, the net impact on employment would be zero. TPP As we’ve detailed quite extensively, Clinton once hailed TPP as setting ""the gold standard in trade agreements"" during her time in the Obama administration, but she came out in opposition during her 2016 bid. Though she’s always said the details needed to be hammered out, her comments about the deal were largely supportive from 2010 to 2013. Here are some of the words she used to describe TPP: ""exciting,"" ""innovative,"" ""ambitious,"" ""groundbreaking,"" ""cutting-edge,"" ""high quality,"" ""high standard"" and ""gold standard."" In October 2015, Clinton flip-flopped and opposed it, telling PBS, ""I don’t believe it’s going to meet the high bar I have set."" Our ruling Trump said Clinton ""supported NAFTA, and she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization…. She supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership."" Trump is right that Clinton once supported NAFTA and TPP and has yet to revoke her support for China’s inclusion in the WTO or the deal with South Korea. But there are caveats. Clinton no longer supports NAFTA or TPP, and it’s not entirely clear that trade with South Korea has killed jobs. Trump’s statement is accurate because it’s carefully phrased, but it needs additional context. We rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/68c1a4d5-56ad-4a84-87b6-564b5037df5b",[<zip object at 0x000002809C074E80>],/factchecks/2016/jul/22/donald-trump/donald-trumps-largely-accurate-about-clintons-past/

Despite new adverb, Trump's claim about Clinton wanting to 'abolish' 2nd Amendment is still False
","In officially accepting the GOP presidential nomination, Donald Trump tried to finesse one of his favorite but false attacks on the campaign trail: ""My opponent wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment,""  Trump said July 21 in Cleveland. It’s nice that Trump added the word ""essentially,"" but the charge is still not without faults. When we last looked at the claim, we found no evidence that Clinton has ever said she wants to repeal or abolish the Second Amendment. She has called for stronger regulations, but continuously affirms her support for the right to bear arms. However, gun rights advocates argue that it’s reasonable to infer from a few comments that she wants to roll back the Second Amendment as it’s currently interpreted. Straight shooting on the campaign trail In both her 2008 and 2016 White House bids, Clinton has called for more gun control all the while saying she ""believes in the Second Amendment."" Here are a few examples of comments she’s made: • January 2008, Democratic presidential debate: ""I believe in the Second Amendment. People have a right to bear arms. But I also believe that we can common-sensically approach this."" • August 2015, in response to the on-air murders of a news crew in Virginia: ""We are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures, so whatever motivated this murderer ... we will not see more needless, senseless deaths."" • January 2016, on Twitter: ""Nobody's attacking the Second Amendment. We can protect Americans' rights — and also protect families from gun violence. #GOPdebate"" • June 2016, on ABC’s This Week: ""I believe we can have common-sense gun-safety measures consistent with the Second Amendment."" (More on this later.) Setting aside the bulk of Clinton’s comments on protecting the Second Amendment (examples here, here, here, here, here and here), we’ll now go over three points that some gun rights advocates and experts say gives Trump’s charge some credence. Smoking guns? Clinton riled the gun lobby with two eyebrow-raising comments last fall and one from this spring. Clinton said in October 2015 a national gun buyback program like Australia’s compulsory program was ""worth looking into."" After a gunman killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in 1996, Australia banned semiautomatic and automatic weapons and enacted a mandatory buyback of the newly prohibited guns. That program is ""incompatible with private ownership of guns,"" Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told us in May. (The National Rifle Association shares this view.) The full context of Clinton’s response, however, suggests she may have misspoken or not fully understood Australia’s program, as she also evoked voluntary buybacks as potential models for a U.S. program. Second, Clinton said in a leaked recording of a private fundraiser that she thinks the Supreme Court ""is wrong on the Second Amendment,"" referring to its landmark ruling in District of Columbia vs. Heller. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down Washington’s handgun ban and recognized that the Second Amendment applies to the individual’s right to bear arms. Experts who support gun rights told us undoing Heller basically ends the Second Amendment as currently interpreted. They pointed out that former Justice Department officials under President Bill Clinton and his appointees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued in Heller that gun regulations do not violate the Second Amendment because it primarily pertains to a well-regulated militia, not the individual right to bear arms. Clinton, in her June interview on This Week, added fuel to the fire when she appeared to talk about the individual right as a hypothetical. ""Do you believe that their conclusion that an individual's right to bear arms is a constitutional right?"" host George Stephanopoulos asked. ""If it is a constitutional right, then it, like every other constitutional right, is subject to reasonable regulation,"" she responded. ""And what people have done with (the Heller) decision is to take it as far as they possibly can and reject what has been our history from the very beginning of the republic, where some of the earliest laws that were passed were about firearms."" The NRA and voices on the right seized upon these comments as proof that Clinton doesn’t really believe in the individual right to bear arms. But that ignores what she said immediately after: ""So I think it's important to recognize that reasonable people can say, as I do, responsible gun owners have a right — I have no objection to that. But the rest of the American public has a right to require certain kinds of regularity, responsible actions to protect everyone else."" UCLA Second Amendment expert Adam Winkler, meanwhile, said that the accuracy of Trump’s charge depends on Clinton’s grounds for rejecting Heller. (According to news reports from the 2008 election, she supported Washington’s handgun ban.) ""If she thought the reasoning was wrong, but the result right, then she would fit in with a number of strong pro-gun advocates,"" he said. ""If, however, she thought there should be no protection for gun rights, then Trump's claim comes closer to the truth."" The Clinton campaign previously told us Clinton ""believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe."" This suggests Clinton disagrees with the court declaring the district’s ban on handguns unconstitutional, not necessarily the individual right itself — a position that’s more or less in line with the George W. Bush administration’s position on Heller of recognizing the right but allowing reasonable curtailment. Our ruling Trump said, ""My opponent wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment."" The addition of the word essentially doesn’t change the accuracy of this claim. We found no evidence of Clinton ever saying verbatim or suggesting explicitly she wants to abolish the Second Amendment. The bulk of her comments suggest the opposite: She wants to enact stricter gun control, but has no objection to responsible gun ownership. Gun advocates say Trump’s claim is backed up by Clinton’s openness to a gun buyback program and her disagreement with a Supreme Court decision on the Second Amendment. But whether or not these cherry-picked comments actually reveal Clinton’s intentions is a matter of interpretation. We rate Trump’s claim False.   https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/85ef6fa9-d3d9-4a5f-afd2-40af77b1eb94",[<zip object at 0x000002809C072A80>],/factchecks/2016/jul/22/donald-trump/despite-new-adverb-trumps-claim-about-clinton-want/
"['National', 'Taxes', 'Donald Trump']","
Donald Trump says he had the biggest tax cuts of any 2016 candidate
","During this acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Donald Trump contrasted his stance on tax policy with that of his rival, Hillary Clinton. ""While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year, Democrat or Republican,"" Trump said. We’ll analyze both parts of this statement in order. Clinton’s tax increase Clinton does propose an increase in taxes, though it’s a stretch to call it massive The Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent think tank, estimates that most Americans won’t be affected by Clinton’s proposed tax hikes because they are targeted at the highest earners. She would create a 4 percent surcharge on incomes over $5 million and impose a 30 percent minimum rate on adjusted gross incomes above $1 million; She would also limit itemized deduction benefits at 28 percent; raise rates on medium-term capital gains to between 27.8 percent and 47.4 percent; increase the top estate tax rate to 45 percent and reduce the threshold to $3.5 million; and limit the value of tax-deferred retirement accounts. These changes would fall most heavily on the richest taxpayers, and for them, the hit would indeed be substantial. For the top 5 percent of taxpayers, the increases would average $2,673, or reduction of a bit less than 1 percent in after-tax income. For the top 1 percent of taxpayers, the increases would average $78,000, which is equal to a 5 percent reduction in after-tax income. For the top one-tenth of 1 percent -- who earn $3.7 million or above -- the extra tax bite would be $520,000, or a 7.6 percent reduction in after-tax income. For the other 95 percent of taxpayers, the hit is relatively minor. Middle-income households would pay about $44 more on average, and the poorest filers would lose an additional $4. All told, Clinton’s plan would increase revenues collected by $1.1 trillion over 10 years, according to modeling by the Tax Policy Center. ""That’s roughly a 2.5 percent increase in projected revenue for the decade,"" said Roberton Williams, a Tax Policy Center fellow. Williams acknowledged that the question of whether this counts as ""massive"" is a subjective question. Still, he said, ""not in my book."" Richard Borean, communications director of the more conservative Tax Foundation, concurred that the question is a subjective one. He did add that Clinton’s plan is far more modest than the one offered by her former rival for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders. Sanders’ proposed revenue increase, according to the Tax Foundation’s own modeling, is more than 20 times bigger than Clinton’s. Trump’s tax cuts Trump is on solid ground with the second half of his statement. He would consolidate the existing seven income brackets (with rates from 10 to 39.6 percent) into three with rates at 10, 20 and 25 percent. He would also Increase the standard deduction from $6,300 to $25,000 for single filers and from $12,600 to $50,000 for joint filers and phase out most itemized deductions, except for charitable giving and mortgage interest. And he would eliminate the estate tax, the alternative minimum tax, the Affordable Care Act taxes, and the marriage penalty. The Tax Policy Center calculated that the average tax cuts for the top 1 percent would be $275,000, or 17.5 percent of after-tax income, and for the top 0.1 percent, they would be $1.3 million, or nearly 19 percent. Middle-income households, meanwhile, would get a cut of $2,700, or a 4.9 percent reduction. Those making the least would see a cut, too, but only of $128 or so, roughly 1 percent of after-tax income. The Tax Policy Center found that Trump’s plan would reduce revenues by the most of any candidate it analyzed. Revenues under Trump’s plan would fall by $9.5 trillion over 10 years, compared to $8.6 trillion under Ted Cruz’s plan and $6.8 trillion under Marco Rubio’s plan. (The center did not analyze the plans of several Republican candidates -- including John Kasich, Chris Christie and Ben Carson -- for a variety of reasons.) The Tax Foundation’s analyses agreed. ""Trump’s plan is, in fact, the largest tax cut proposed by any candidate,"" Borean said. ""His plan would reduce revenue by $10.14 trillion over 10 years after accounting for the impact on the economy, or $11.98 without."" We’ll note, however, that economists are skeptical that Trump’s tax cuts would be sustainable, since they would require either massive cuts to discretionary federal spending or an explosion of new debt. ""He says economic growth and cuts would make up for that, but it’s hard to imagine that it would be possible to do so,"" Williams said. Our ruling Trump said, ""While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year, Democrat or Republican."" Clinton is indeed proposing a tax increase, though it can be described as ""massive"" for only the richest Americans. Meanwhile, Trump is correct that his tax cuts were the biggest of any 2016 candidate.

"['National', 'Trade', 'Donald Trump']","
Trump gives half the story on trade deals, the Clintons and factory jobs
","Donald Trump tapped into a deep well of bitterness over jobs and trade to win the Republican nomination and in his acceptance speech, he placed the blame squarely on the shoulders of his Democratic opponent. ""America has lost nearly one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton,"" Trump told a roaring crowd. Trump offered the same statistic when he laid out his economic policies at a speech in Pennsylvania in June. That speech went into more detail, and best of all for fact-checkers, his campaign footnoted his sources in the transcript. As he did at the convention, in that policy speech, Trump faulted the Clintons. ""At the center of this catastrophe are two trade deals pushed by Bill and Hillary Clinton,"" he said in Pennsylvania. ""First, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. Second, China's entry into the World Trade Organization."" As we looked into Trump’s words, we found that his numbers are fine. The impact of the trade deals on manufacturing, and his singling out of the Clintons, are more problematic. By the way, while Hillary Clinton played no official role in either deal, in the past, she came down in favor of both them, even if she noted their failings. The numbers Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that manufacturing jobs dropped by about 30 percent between 1997 and 2016. About 17.4 million people worked in manufacturing at the start of the period. Today, their ranks have fallen to about 12.3 million. Trump has his numbers right. Impact of the trade deals The North American Free Trade Agreement dates to 1994 and created an open trade zone across Mexico, the United States and Canada. The deal with China wasn’t a trade agreement in the same way. Instead, in 2001, Congress cleared the path for China to become part of the World Trade Organization. That locked in lower tariffs, spurred investment in China and produced a lot more movement of goods. While Trump regularly says that NAFTA sent jobs to Mexico, the net effect on all jobs, including manufacturing, is hard to pin down. In contrast, there’s broad agreement that the change with China did cost America millions of jobs. The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan think tank of Congress, concluded in 2015 that NAFTA likely had little impact on jobs one way or the other. That’s generally the consensus view, although some economists think NAFTA did hurt American jobs. On China, research by economists Justin Pierce at the Federal Reserve and Peter Schott at Yale University, suggests over 1 million jobs have been lost due to trade with China. Trump has relied heavily on the research of Robert Scott, director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the Economic Policy Institute, to make his point. The institute isn’t the sort of source traditionally used by Republicans. It supports a hefty increase in the minimum wage and higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations. Scott estimates that America lost over 700,000 jobs to Mexico and about 2 million manufacturing jobs due to a rising trade deficit with China. But Scott takes exception to Trump’s use of his work. ""The story is complex, and certainly neither the Clinton’s, nor trade deals alone, explain the loss of 5.3 million manufacturing jobs since 1998 when manufacturing employment peaked,"" Scott told us. ""No one has adequately teased apart all of the causes."" In an op-ed, Scott listed several other factors that have hurt American workers, including the policies of the Federal Reserve, a stagnant minimum wage and a lack of public investment in infrastructure. Martin Baily, a trade economist at the Brookings Institution, an academic center in Washington, puts even less stock in the impact of the two trade deals. He points to longer term trends. ""The share of manufacturing employment in total U.S. employment has been declining for at least 50 years and the rate of decline in that share did not accelerate either because of NAFTA or China,"" Baily said. He told us that as much as Americans like their flat-screen TV and other goods, our demand for services like health care has grown faster. That has cut into manufacturing employment. And then, there’s the impact of technology in factories. ""Productivity growth has meant that it takes fewer people to make the goods,"" Baily said. So it’s fair to say that NAFTA may or may not have reduced American manufacturing jobs (with the consensus falling on the side that it didn’t), and that the China deal probably did. But in no case do economists put the entire number of jobs lost on either of the trade deals. Blaming the Clintons The third part of Trump’s claim is that the trade deals and their alleged failures are the fault of the Clintons. This is another shaky part of Trump’s claim. Scott at the Economic Policy Institute noted that ""most of the votes needed to pass NAFTA in 1993 were provided by members of Trump’s own party."" President Bill Clinton was certainly a supporter, but he had plenty of Republican help. Susan Houseman, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, a labor policy center in Michigan, said that manufacturing jobs grew in the years immediately following passage of NAFTA. It wasn’t until the China deal that they fell rapidly. Houseman told us the details of that were worked out under President George W. Bush. ""The sharp drop in manufacturing jobs coincided with China's accession to the WTO in 2001, which in any event was supported by both Democratic and Republican administrations,"" Houseman said. Our ruling Trump said that America has lost about a third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 after enactment of two trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton. Government figures show about a 30 percent decline in manufacturing jobs. Bill Clinton advocated for both deals. And while Hillary Clinton played no official role, she has spoken in favor of trade agreements. But Trump’s statement overlooks that manufacturing employment climbed after passage of NAFTA. The general consensus among economists is that overall, NAFTA has neither helped nor hurt American workers. There’s broad agreement that China’s entry to the WTO has come at the price of many American manufacturing jobs, with estimates ranging from about a million to over 2 million. But that would be less than half of the manufacturing jobs lost that Trump talked about. Trump’s focus on the Clintons also overlooks the key role played by Republicans. In naming the Clintons, he leaves out at least half of the picture. There’s a measure of truth in Trump’s words, but he omits a lot of important information.

Donald Trump says at RNC that Hillary Clinton 'wants sanctuary cities'
","Donald Trump said at the Republican convention that nothing affected him more deeply than spending time with parents who have lost their children to violence ""spilling across our border."" He said that Hillary Clinton favors shielding undocumented immigrants from federal laws. ""My opponent wants sanctuary cities,"" Trump said to boos. Sanctuary cities are jurisdictions that have laws or practices that limit their assistance to federal immigration officials, for a variety of reasons that we’ll explain. Trump proposes eliminating federal grants to sanctuary cities. Clinton expressed support for the sanctuary city policies during her first presidential race in 2008. During her current race, she criticized decisions by a particular city in the spotlight for sanctuary policy; however, she did reiterate her support for sanctuary cities. We did not get a reply from the Trump campaign for this fact-check. Clinton’s comments on sanctuary cities in 2016 race There is no blanket legal definition of sanctuary cities, but it generally refers to places where local law enforcement officers aren’t required to alert federal authorities to residents who may be in the country illegally. Supporters of such policies, often in liberal jurisdictions or places with large Hispanic populations, say it’s not the job of local officials to help deport residents accused of low-level crimes. Supporters also say they don’t want undocumented immigrants to fear the police and avoid reporting crimes to them. Opponents say that sanctuary cities harm the federal government’s ability to enforce immigration laws and give some undocumented immigrants a pass. Attacking opponents for supporting sanctuary cities became a nationwide political talking point after the July 2015 shooting death of Kate Steinle of San Francisco. The alleged shooter, who was from Mexico and had been deported several times in the past, had been released from San Francisco’s jail facing drug charges, despite a federal request to keep him in custody so he could face deportation. The case sparked a debate over rules like San Francisco’s quarter-century-old law declaring it a ""city and county of refuge."" The law banned public employees from assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement with investigations or arrests unless required by a law or a warrant or for people convicted of felonies. Steinle’s death prompted the city to revisit the law. About a week later, Clinton was asked about her position on sanctuary cities on CNN. Brianna Keilar: ""When you last ran for president you supported sanctuary cities. In light of this terrible incident, does that change anything about your view on this?"" Clinton: ""Well, what should be done is any city should listen to the Department of Homeland Security, which as I understand it, urged them to deport this man again after he got out of prison another time. Here's a case where we've deported, we've deported, we've deported. He ends back up in our country, and I think the city made a mistake. The city made a mistake, not to deport someone that the federal government strongly felt should be deported. ""So I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on. ""However, there are -- like if it were a first-time traffic citation, if it were something minor, a misdemeanor, that's entirely different. This man had already been deported five times. And he should have been deported at the request of the federal government."" Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin sent PolitiFact a statement the campaign issued a couple days after the CNN interview to clarify her position: ""Hillary Clinton believes that sanctuary cities can help further public safety, and she has defended those policies going back years."" Clinton’s comments on sanctuary cities in 2008 race Clinton appeared more favorable toward sanctuary cities during her first presidential campaign During an interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly in 2008, Clinton defended sanctuary cities. O’Reilly: ""Are you going to crack down on the sanctuary cities?"" Clinton: ""No, I’m not. And I’ll tell you why. … I’m not because the reason why a lot of those folks do it — in New York, why do police officers turn a blind eye? O’Reilly: ""Because they want them to report crimes."" Clinton: ""They want them to report crimes. Because… sometimes you have two competing values. You want to report crime, you want to protect people and the violence spills way beyond whatever community."" Our ruling Trump said that Clinton ""wants sanctuary cities."" During her first race for president, Clinton expressed support for sanctuary cities and said she wouldn’t crack down on them. She argued that without such policies, people will hide from police and not report crimes. In 2015, Clinton criticized the city of San Francisco for releasing a man from jail who later was charged with murdering a woman and had previously been deported many times. However, her campaign reiterated Clinton’s view that she believes sanctuary cities can help further public safety.

Donald Trump again fails to screen out the falsehood in oft-repeated claim on Syrian refugees
","Immigration has been the cornerstone of Donald Trump's campaign, so it was not surprising he raised the issue again in his acceptance speech for the Republican presidential nomination. He attacked Hillary Clinton’s plans to accept refugees and promised to choke off all immigration from countries who might be sending terrorists to the United States. ""We must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place,"" he told the crowd in Cleveland on July 21. ""My opponent has called for a radical 550 percent increase in Syrian, think of this, think of this. ... A 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country already under the leadership of President Obama,"" he said. ""She proposes this despite the fact that there’s no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people."" We've addressed these issues in several other fact-checks. The bottom line: Trump is wrong to suggest that screening isn't done and correct when he says Clinton has recommended a 550 percent increase. Let's go through the relevant points. The migration of thousands of Syrians fleeing a war that has killed more than 200,000 has been called the largest humanitarian crisis since World War II. The fear — here and in some of the countries that have accepted them – is that some of those people might be terrorists posing as refugees. Compared to other countries, the United States has accepted very few – about 2,000 last year, for example. Half are children. Only about 2 percent are single men of combat age, the mostly likely demographic for a would-be terrorist. President Barack Obama said in 2015 that he would increase the number to 10,000. Then, during a Sept. 20, 2015, appearance on CBS' Face the Nation, Clinton said that, given the scope of the problem, ""I think the United States has to do more, and I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000, and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in."" That's the 550 percent increase Trump and the Republicans have been talking about. That part of Trump's statement is accurate. But contrary to Trump's claim that ""there’s no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from,"" the refugees are already screened, although like any security program, there are no guarantees. Said Raj Shah, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, ""The head of the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and the National Counterterrorism Center in the Obama Administration have all testified that because of the lack of databases in Syria, existing procedures cannot effectively ensure that ISIS-linked terrorists are not posing as refugees and coming into the United States.""  According to the U.S. refugees admissions program, created in 1980 and retooled after 9/11, a would-be refugee must first get a referral from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, a U.S. embassy or a recognized non-government organization. The U.N. process takes four to 10 months, and only about 1 percent are recommended for resettlement. And that's before the United States begins its probe, where the names, biographical information and fingerprints are run through federal terrorism and criminal databases. In addition, the refugees are interviewed by Department of Homeland Security officials. If they pass those hurdles, they also have to pass medical screening, have a sponsor agency, pass ""cultural orientation"" classes and be examined for another security clearance. As we reported in November, Syrian refugees are singled out for an additional level of scrutiny, with their documents cross-referenced with classified and unclassified information. Only then, after a process that takes one to two years, or longer, can they come to the United States. There could be gaps in some of the information because they are fleeing war, but if ISIS or another terrorist group wanted to get someone in the United States, experts told us, it would be faster and easier to arrange to fly them in as a tourist. Our ruling Trump said Hillary Clinton ""has called for a radical 550 percent increase in Syrian ... refugees ...  despite the fact that there’s no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from."" The 550 percent figure is correct. To say that there's no way to screen them to find out who they are or where they come from ignores the extensive screening they undergo.

Trump: 43 million Americans on food stamps
","For all of the spending in Washington under President Barack Obama, the American people are not better off, Donald Trump argued in his July 21 speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination. ""President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing,"" Trump said. ""Yet what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in third-world condition, and 43 million Americans are on food stamps."" We wanted to fact-check his statistic about Americans using the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the program formerly known as food stamps. SNAP benefits provide vouchers for groceries for qualifying low-income Americans. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, counted almost 43.6 million people in the program in April 2016, the most recent data available. So Trump is on point, numbers-wise. But there’s a dollop more to the story. The amount of people on food stamps, while considerable, is an improvement. When Obama took office in January 2009, almost 32 million people received SNAP benefits. The number increased during the Great Recession as more families turned to the program for assistance, averaging an annual high of 47.6 million participants in 2013. A report by the Food Research & Action Center, a hunger and nutrition advocacy group, applauded the 43 million figure in April as the lowest level of participants since October 2010. From April 2015 to April 2016, participation is down 1.9 million participants. We explained in a previous fact-check that it’s unclear whether SNAP sign-ups would have been just as high under a Republican president, as the economy was weakening before Obama took office. The beneficiary pool was already increasing under President George W. Bush, whose administration broadened eligibility criteria and tried to get more Americans to apply for SNAP assistance. The Republican policy platform approved at the RNC recommends breaking the SNAP program away from the USDA and the farm bill, under which funding for the program is usually negotiated in Congress. As an independent entity, SNAP would be more vulnerable to budget cuts. Our ruling Trump said, ""Forty-three million Americans are on food stamps."" The number of SNAP participants has been falling in recent years amid the economic recovery, but Trump is reciting the most recent participation.

Trump says number of illegal immigrant families crossing border this year exceeds 2015 total
","In his speech accepting the Republican Party nomination for president, Donald Trump laid out his assessment of the nation and said it was time to go back to safety, prosperity and peace. ""We will be a country of generosity and warmth,"" Trump said. ""But we will also be a country of law and order."" That includes getting tough on immigration policy. ""The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015,"" Trump said. We were curious to know if so far this year, the number of immigrant families who have crossed the border has surpassed all of 2015. Definition of family Immigration experts pointed us to U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics on monthly and fiscal-year apprehensions of families along the Southwest border. CBP uses apprehensions as an indicator of total attempts to cross the border illegally. Ana Gonzalez-Barrera, a senior researcher at Pew Research Center, says the definition of a family unit is quite loose, but basically involves at least one child who is accompanied by at least one adult who is their parent or legal guardian. Turning to the data There are two ways to interpret the data — by calendar year (January 1 to December 31) and by fiscal year (October 1 to September 30). And that makes all the difference. By calendar year -- the way most people would interpret Trump’s comment -- he’s wrong. But by fiscal year, he’s right. CBP’s has apprehended 29,682 family members from January to June 2016, records show. In all of 2015, CBP apprehended more family members, 53,840. If he’s reading by fiscal year, as CBP reports it, then the numbers support his statement. In fiscal year 2015 (Oct. 1, 2014-Sept. 30, 2015), there were 39,838 apprehensions. So far from Oct. 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016, there have been a total of 51,152 apprehensions. Fiscal year 2016 includes three months -- October to December 2015 -- when there was a notable spike in apprehensions. From October to December 2015, there were 21,470 apprehensions — 2.8 times higher than the same period in 2014 and 4.1 times higher than combined average for same months over the last four years (2012–15). What caused the numbers to spike? Experts aren’t sure. Federal officials generally have discussed challenges created by Central American families trying to enter the United States. ""We are cognizant that conditions in Central America push many to flee the region in search of a better life in the United States, and recognize the need to provide a safe alternative path to our country, and that many from the region should be regarded as refugees,"" Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Jeh C. Johnson said in a statement accompanying the latest data. Nestor Rodriguez, a sociology professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has been researching immigrant communities for decades, said these numbers mainly represent young mothers with small children from Central America ""fleeing poverty and lethal danger from gangs in their countries,"" many who turn themselves into Border Patrol to seek asylum. Our ruling Trump said, ""The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015."" Many would understand it as calendar year and by this metric, Trump is wrong. However, Customs and Border Protection reports apprehension data by fiscal year. And by that measure, he has a point.

Donald Trump says before Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State 'ISIS was not even on the map.'
","Donald Trump told the audience of the Republican National Convention that ISIS wasn’t an issue before Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. ""In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map,"" he said July 21. ""Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing, really a big big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control. After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the entire world."" Trump made a similar claim pointing the finger at Clinton for the creation of ISIS in an interview that aired on 60 Minutes Sunday, a day before the convention began. While the name ISIS (or Islamic State or Daesh, etc.) is relatively new, the leaders and founders have origins that pre-date Clinton’s time as the chief diplomat of the United States. ""There were evolutions that took place with some of the name changes,"" Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, previously told PolitiFact. (He has testified before Congress multiple times and works for a foundation focused on foreign policy and security.) The roots of what today is the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, trace back to 2004, when longtime Sunni extremist Abu Mus‘ab al-Zarqawi established al-Qaida in Iraq, according to the National Counterterrorism Center. After a U.S. airstrike killed al-Zarqawi in 2006, the group became the Islamic State of Iraq. In 2013, the group was referred to as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham and then just the Islamic State in 2014, Brian Fishman, a counterterrorism expert at the New America Foundation, has told PolitiFact. ""Al-Sham just refers to the Levant and reflects the group's increased focus on Syria,"" he said. ""It reflects a geographic shift rather than change in political focus. It's the same group throughout."" Given the timing, Democrats are prone to blame President George W. Bush for the creation of ISIS, because al-Qaida flourished after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Republicans seize on different moments. President Barack Obama’s decision to leave Iraq after 2011 contributed to a security vacuum that gave ISIS the chance to put down roots there, said Michael O’Hanlon, a security expert at the Brookings Institution, a centrist-to-liberal group. (O’Hanlon is one of hundreds of voluntary advisers to the Clinton campaign but has a minor role.) You could say the blame touches both Bush, for creating a strong space for al-Qaida in Mesopotamia, and Obama, for giving the group a chance to regroup. Trump is implying that Clinton’s actions had something to do with the birth of ISIS. Experts said his evidence is thin. For the earlier fact-check, Trump’s campaign singled out Clinton’s vote as a senator to authorize force in Iraq in 2002. She later said she regretted that vote. Republicans have blamed Obama for not keeping 10,000 troops in place in Iraq, which they say could have deterred the opening for ISIS. However, Obama inherited a timeline to exit Iraq from Bush, and there was no agreement to leave a large force behind. Trump’s campaign also highlighted Clinton’s support of regime change in Syria (which didn’t work out) and Libya. The overthrow of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi contributed to giving ISIS an opening, said Christopher Preble, a defense expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""Clinton's enthusiasm for regime change in Libya in 2011, which Obama endorsed, resulted in the collapse of order there, which ISIS and others have exploited,"" he said. ""That is a fair criticism, in my opinion."" But experts said Clinton isn’t individually responsible for the group, even if various factors gave ISIS the room to grow in power. The sources of ISIS are complex and interconnected, said John Pike, an expert on defense and director of GlobalSecurity.org, a website that provides information on defense. ""She may ‘share some of the blame,’ but there is more than enough share to go around,"" Pike said. ""She was in no sense the singular author of the thing."" Our ruling Trump said, ""In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map."" The terrorist group known as ISIS was, in fact, on the map five years before Clinton became secretary of state. It was operating under a different name. There were several factors that allowed ISIS to gain strength, including the intervention in Libya, an Obama decision that she supported, and the Iraq invasion, which she voted for as a U.S. senator. But Trump misleads when he pins the rise of ISIS solely on Clinton.

Donald Trump says homicides are up 17 percent in 50 biggest cities, largest increase in 25 years
","Donald Trump accepted the Republican nomination with a speech full of concern about a breakdown in law and order. ""Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration’s rollback of criminal enforcement,"" he said. ""Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America’s 50 largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years."" We’ll give Trump credit for sticking close to what we presume is his source material. We located an almost identical passage in an article published in January 2016 by the Wonkblog team at the Washington Post: ""The number of homicides in the country's 50 largest cities rose nearly 17 percent last year, the greatest increase in lethal violence in a quarter century,"" the article began. The article cited Wonkblog’s own calculations. However, Trump ignored some significant cautionary notes in that same story. The Post article said that a close look at the figures ""suggests no single explanation for the increases and reveals no clear pattern among those cities that experienced the most horrific violence."" For instance, the article noted that other data shows a more modest increase. ""A preliminary FBI report released last week showed that the overall number of violent offenses increased just 1.7 percent nationally during the first half of the year while the number of property crimes declined 4.2 percent,"" the Post article noted. The article also noted that the increases are scattershot. ""There were more killings in Nashville, but the total in Memphis declined by 1 percent,"" the Post article noted. ""The number of homicides increased 25 percent in Houston, but decreased 9 percent in San Antonio. There were seven fewer homicides last year than in 2014 in Fresno, Calif., a decline of 15 percent. Meanwhile, up Highway 99 in Sacramento, there were 43 killings last year, an increase of 54 percent."" ""There's no national pattern,"" Franklin Zimring, a criminologist at the University of California at Berkeley, told the Post. Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, agreed. ""Everything is basically anecdotal,"" he told the Post. ""There's not a clear national picture that I've been able to discern of what might be contributing to the changes."" James Alan Fox, the interim director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University, told PolitiFact that the most recent data is heavily driven by four large cities with disproportionate increases -- Chicago, Houston, Washington and Baltimore. Fox and others urged PolitiFact not to make too much of changes in data over the course of a single year. It’s better to look at a range of years to spot lasting trends. ""There is volatility in numbers like these,"" he said. For instance, he said, in 2012, there were more than 500 homicides in Chicago. That fell to the lower 400s each of the next two years before rising again to the high 400s in 2015. ""Ironically, some of the time when the numbers go up it may be because there was an unusually low number the previous year. A one-year change is not a reliable trend,"" Fox said. And over the long term, rates of violent crime have moved in the right direction. As we have previously noted, FBI data shows that violent crime has been falling on an almost uninterrupted basis since the early 1990s. The data below shows violent crime per 100,000 population from 1993 to 2014, the last full year for which data is available.  ""Homicide rates have declined steadily since 1993, through both Republican and Democratic presidencies,"" said Raymond Paternoster, a University of Maryland criminologist. And as a result of this long-term decline, the crime rate has been ""low for so long that a tiny increase becomes a large percent increase,"" said Alan Lizotte, criminal justice professor at the University at Albany. Our ruling Trump said, ""Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America’s 50 largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years."" The statement comes from a credible source -- calculations made by the Washington Post. However, in painting a bleak picture, Trump cherry-picks the Post’s overall findings -- and makes mistakes criminologists warn about. The Post article acknowledged that FBI data found a smaller increase in recent years, with contradictory results for many cities. And experts caution against putting too much stock in short-term changes, since year-to-year data can be volatile for hard-to-discern reasons. Lost in Trump’s formulation is that, overall, violent crime has been falling consistently for about a quarter century. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores facts that would give a different impression, so we rate his claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/729fe9ae-3336-4971-8c96-52b25f6b4e25  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4E81C0>],/factchecks/2016/jul/22/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-homicides-are-17-percent-50-bigg/

Donald Trump says Latino poverty has grown under Obama, ignores important stat
","Are you better off than you were eight years ago? Donald Trump posed this classic election-year question in his speech accepting the Republican nomination for president at the party’s national convention in Cleveland. ""What about our economy?"" he asked. ""I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper,"" he continued. ""Nearly four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58 percent of African-American youth are not employed. Two million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the president took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely."" There’s a lot to unpack there, but given Trump’s attention to immigration from Mexico, we decided to focus on his claim that 2 million more Latinos are in poverty than when Obama took office. As it turns out, poverty among the Hispanic population has been relatively stable under Obama. There’s some literal accuracy to Trump’s claim: About 10.9 million Hispanic people lived below the poverty line in 2008, according to Census figures. And about 13.1 million Hispanics were in poverty in 2014, the most recent year available. That’s a jump of about 2 million. 
 But – and this is a big but – that statistic is essentially meaningless because the country’s Hispanic population has also been growing. The percentage of Hispanics in poverty as a share of the total Hispanic population is a much more useful statistic. Going by that figure, poverty among Hispanics has barely budged over the course of Obama’s presidency. It was 23.2 percent in 2008 and 23.6 percent in 2014. 
 Christopher Wimer and Laura Nolan of the Columbia Population Research Center ran their own numbers for PolitiFact and came to a similar result. The Census data looks at pre-tax cash income, while Wimer and Nolan considered after-tax income and various other non-cash income sources for poor people, like housing assistance and food stamps. According to their figures, the number of Hispanic people living in poverty in 2008 was roughly 12.3 million, and it grew to 14.5 million in 2014, so a change of about 2 million. The poverty rate, however, barely grew from 25.8 percent to 26 percent. Trump’s statement is ""technically true but misleading,"" said Wimer, co-director of the Center on Poverty and Social Policy. Wimer also noted the significance of the fact that Obama took office in the middle of the Great Recession. Normally, poverty grows during a recession. But various economic recovery measures helped to keep poverty under control, like expanded food stamps, unemployment benefits and earned income tax credits. ""It’s not like poverty declined, but (the administration’s recovery measures) pinched the bleeding,"" he said. Our ruling Trump said, ""Two million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the president took his oath of office less than eight years ago."" Literally, about two million more Hispanic people are living in poverty than in the year leading up to Obama’s inauguration. However, this statistic isn’t very meaningful because the Hispanic population overall has also grown. The rate of poverty, a much more useful statistic, has been fairly stable throughout Obama’s presidency, hovering just above 23 percent. So the implication of Trump’s statement — that poverty among Hispanics has grown significantly under Obama — is incorrect. Trump is cherry-picking the rising overall number without mentioning the rate is stable. We rate his claim Half True.   https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/20f68f82-a61d-4509-958f-5f9052477536",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4FFA40>],/factchecks/2016/jul/22/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-latino-poverty-has-grown-under-o/

In the speech, Gutiérrez said, ""Whether it was growing them, picking them, packing them, shipping them, unloading them, or some other part of the process, Strawberry Festival Month really means undocumented farmworker month.""

A report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service found that ""over the past 15 years, about half of the hired workers employed in U.S. crop agriculture were unauthorized, with the overwhelming majority of these workers coming from Mexico."" Some representatives of farm workers say that estimate may even be on the low side. ""Undocumented farmworkers may not feel comfortable answering this question accurately when responding to a government study,"" said Giev Kashkooli, political director of the United Farm Workers of America. Furthermore, many workers ""may choose not to participate in the survey due to fear of responding to a government study."" What about the strawberry industry, specifically? Gutiérrez’s statement was in direct reference to strawberries, so we wanted to know how strawberry farm workers compare to the larger agriculture industry. Another U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service publication cites a report by the U.S. Department of Labor from 2005-09 which shows that 67 percent of fruit and nut hired workers do not have work authorization in the United States, compared to the overall figure of 50 percent. Furthermore, if you consider just new entrants in the fruit and nut industries, those first working on a farm for less than two years, the percentage without authorization is 97 percent, which is 25 points higher than the overall figure for new entrants. Kashkooli and the United Farm Workers of America also shared that the number of H2A (the documented and legal guestworker program) workers in the berry industry is much lower than other agriculture industries. California has a higher rate of undocumented workers than other states, which may further suggest a higher rate of undocumented workers in the strawberry industry since California accounts for over 88 percent of total U.S. strawberry production according to the California Strawberry Commission. Florida has the second-largest strawberry industry in the United States, producing between 10 and 15 percent of the national supply. The Department of Labor directed us to the Florida Strawberry Growers Association for information regarding the status of the state’s strawberry workers. We did not receive a reply from our inquiry. Generally, the berry industry attracts more undocumented workers due to the grueling nature of the work. The necessity of hand-picking each individual berry prompts many to look for work in other industries. It is important to note that not all strawberries consumed in the United States are produced in the United States. According to the USDA’s most recent data, in 2012, if U.S. strawberry exports were subtracted from the total number of strawberries produced in the United States, 2.66 billion pounds of strawberries were consumed in the U.S. market. The United States imported about 566.4 million pounds of strawberries in that same year. So, in terms of percentage, approximately 21.2 percent of strawberries consumed in the United States were imported from other countries, mostly from Mexico. Since over one-fifth of strawberries are not produced in the United States, Gutiérrez’s claim has less viability. Our ruling Gutiérrez stated to the House that, ""Every single strawberry that is served to Members of Congress will have passed through the rough hands of an undocumented immigrant."" The evidence says that about 50 to 70 percent of farm workers in the United States are undocumented. While most data and experts agree that the figure is higher for the strawberry industry, there is no clear way to deduce a solid estimate that would back Gutiérrez’s claim. Since PolitiFact puts the burden of proof on the speaker, we rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970B4200>],/factchecks/2016/jul/22/luis-gutierrez/do-all-strawberries-consumed-congress-pass-through/

U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk falsely attacks Duckworth on IRS expansion
","Does U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth want more Internal Revenue Service auditors coming after taxpayers? As U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk, a Wilmette Republican, ratchets up his first re-election campaign, he recently suggested his Democratic opponent in one of the nation’s most competitive Senate contests was strongly in support of expanding the Internal Revenue Service. In a campaign website press release, the Kirk campaign called Duckworth ""a staunch supporter"" of expanding the federal agency that collects taxes and audits taxpayers, businesses and organizations. We wondered if the suburban Democrat really did want more taxing, collecting and auditing out of the IRS. The context The IRS came under majority Republican fire in recent years for what the GOP said was the tax agency targeting conservative-leaning nonprofits. In 2013, IRS division head Lois Lerner apologized and acknowledged the agency had targeted certain groups for audits of their tax-exempt status. In response, Republicans offered several pieces of legislation designed to rein in the agency taxpayers love to hate. U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Wheaton, sponsored legislation that came up for a vote last April called the ""Preventing IRS Abuse and Protecting Free Speech Act."" His proposal was one of four cited by Kirk campaign spokeswoman Eleni Demertzis to support the claim that Duckworth was a strong supporter of expanding the IRS reach. According to the federal government website Congress.gov, Roskam’s bill would prohibit the IRS from requiring tax-exempt organizations to include details about their contributors in annual returns. Party-line votes Duckworth was one 182 Democrats who opposed what was, primarily, a party-line vote. Kent Redfield, a political science professor emeritus at the University of Illinois-Springfield who specializes in campaign finance, said the Roskam bill was more focused on political donors and freeing nonprofit groups from having to disclose to the IRS who was funding them. To suggest the bill is about IRS expansion is ""a mischaracterization of what the bill is about,"" Redfield said. ""There’s a policy argument there about how much transparency you need, but it isn’t about protecting taxpayers."" Roskam’s bill was opposed by the Center for Responsive Politics and other groups that favor campaign funding transparency, Redfield said. ""That’s just too broad,"" he said. ""It’s a mischaracterization of the issues and the intent of what the legislation was. It’s painting with too broad a brush."" Three other IRS-related bills were cited by the Kirk campaign to back up his claim: HR 4890, HR1206 and HR 4885. HR 1206 would ban the IRS from hiring new employees if any current workers had serious federal tax debt. It would require the agency to certify its employees didn’t owe back taxes. HR 4885 required the tax agency to deposit fees into the treasury and prohibited it from spending without congressional approval. The last bill, HR 4890, would have stopped the IRS from giving employee bonuses until the treasury secretary submitted to Congress a customer service improvement plan. John Frendreis, a Loyola University political science professor, explained the federal government has something called a senior executive service in which some managers give up some civil service protections and in place of that get bonuses. Duckworth’s opposition to a bill that would restrict bonuses could be seen as a vote to increase IRS spending. Still, Frendreis said it’s important to keep in mind the Republican-controlled Congress has been progressively shrinking the IRS budget in recent years. ""It’s really incorrect to say she’s trying to expand the power of the IRS. She’s simply trying to maintain the level of resources necessary for the IRS to do its work."" ""It’s technically true, but not totally true,"" he added. ""The rest are really strong distortions."" And while Duckworth voted against a bill to ban bonuses and against one that curbed IRS hiring, in both cases, Duckworth Deputy Campaign Manager Matt McGrath noted, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analyses of the bills concluded that, overall, they could boost IRS spending by as much as $2.5 million. So, it also could be argued Duckworth’s opposition represented votes to contain the IRS budget. In the case of HR 4885, the bill to require the IRS deposit fees and get legislative approval for spending, the CBO concluded the bill Duckworth opposed would not actually reduce costs at the tax agency. McGrath also pointed to three bills Duckworth supported in 2014 and 2015 that cut IRS spending or held it flat. All four votes cited by the Kirk campaign to back up their claim about Duckworth resulted in partisan roll calls with most Democrats opposing them and most Republicans supporting them. ""It does look like all of these are party-line votes,"" noted David Yepsen, executive director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. ""There's a lot of hyperbole in this description. There are a lot of subjective phrases and words there."" ""This is an unpopular agency,"" Frendreis said. ""It’s an easy target. The purpose of these bills in the first place is to establish this campaign narrative."" Our ruling Kirk called Duckworth a staunch supporter of expanding the spending and sweep of the nation’s tax agency. The record shows Duckworth joined most Democrats in opposing four GOP efforts to restrict the agency’s information collection and boost congressional oversight. But independent experts and Congress’ own nonpartisan budget analyst said some of the GOP bills actually would boost spending or would not cut it. Duckworth also has voted for large spending bills that did trim IRS budgets. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967900C0>],/factchecks/2016/jul/21/mark-kirk/congresswoman-tammy-duckworth-staunch-supporter-ir/

Does North Carolina have the largest military bases?
","The U.S. spends far more than any other country in the world on its military. And at the Republican National Convention, the North Carolina Republican Party proudly announced that the Tar Heel State, more than any other, is a reflection of those policies. ""The land of the longleaf pine, the land where the summer sun doth shine, where the weak grow strong and the strong grow great,"" said N.C. delegate John Steward, introducing the state during roll call. ""North Carolina, home of the largest military installations in the world."" True or not, a claim about military bases pales in comparison to getting your own state capital wrong, like the Nevada delegation did. But still, we were intrigued. Does North Carolina really have the world’s largest military installations? We’ll narrow this claim down to just the largest U.S. bases in the world. It’s impossible to accurately verify how large various Chinese, Indian, Russian and North Korean bases (the only countries with militaries comparable in size to the U.S.) might be. Different metrics What does it mean to be the largest military base? Biggest land area? Most air space? Most active-duty military members? Largest population in total? The most buildings and square footage? The most expensive facilities? Those are all good indicators, although we’ll give the most weight to a base’s geographic size and, especially, its military population. For data on physical size and cost, we relied on a 2009 report the Department of Defense compiled on its sprawling infrastructure. The U.S. has the world’s largest military footprint, with hundreds of bases spanning the globe from Asia to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and South America. So where does North Carolina stack up? Two North Carolina bases are among the largest in their respective branches in terms of military population, as well as facility value – the Army’s Fort Bragg and the Marine Corps’ Camp Lejeune. However both of them are dwarfed, in area, by other bases out West. Still, we’re more concerned with military strength than with area, so that’s pretty convincing. But are North Carolina’s the absolute largest, or just among the biggest? Army Fort Bragg in Fayetteville is home to the 82nd Airborne and a host of other units ranging from intelligence to artillery. People there are fond of saying it has more generals than anywhere but the Pentagon, but that’s a fact check for another day. We just want to know how big it is. At about 153,000 acres, it trails Fort Hood in Texas and Fort Benning in Georgia. And all of them are puny compared to the 900,000-acre Fort Wainwright in Alaska. But Bragg’s population is the largest of any base in any branch of the military – not just the Army. Back in 2010, PolitiFact looked into a claim by Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who said Hood was the biggest. He got a Half True because some days Bragg had more people, and other days Hood did. But as the war on terror has gone on, special forces are more in vogue, and Fort Bragg is where many of those units are based. As of 2015 it was substantially larger than Fort Hood. Bragg had 53,660 soldiers last year, according to the Fayetteville Observer, while Hood had 40,820 according to the Killeen Daily Herald. It’s also possible that some soldiers at Bragg might not be included in official counts, since even their units’ names are sometimes kept secret. Bragg is home to the Joint Special Operations Command, in which Navy SEALs, Army Delta Force and other secretive groups often team up with CIA operatives for sensitive missions. A small airfield in nearby Johnston County was likely once a major piece of the CIA’s ""extraordinary rendition"" program. Bragg’s entire population of soldiers and civilians is about 140,000 people. If it were a city, it would be one of the largest in North Carolina. So North Carolina has America’s largest single military installation. But the roll call statement said it has the world’s largest installations, plural. So let’s keep looking. Marines North Carolina’s second-biggest base is the Marine Corps’ Camp Lejeune. Is it also the country’s second-biggest? No. In fact, it’s not even the biggest Marine Corps base. The largest, in terms of area and population, are both in California. Twentynine Palms has a relatively small population but covers 650,000 acres, and Camp Pendleton has more Marines than Lejeune – although that hasn’t always been the case. Lejeune had more Marines in 2008, with about 48,000 compared to 42,000 at Pendleton. But by 2013, according to Marine Corps reports, Pendleton has risen to 46,000, compared to 41,000 at Lejeune. And what about the other branches of the military? North Carolina has no significant Navy presence, let alone anything that could compete with the 44,000 sailors at Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia. The Air Force and Coast Guard have some medium-sized bases in North Carolina, but Air Force bases in Nevada and Florida are significantly larger, and the Coast Guard only says its Elizabeth City base is is ""one of the busiest"" and even then, just in terms of air operations. Our ruling The N.C. GOP introduced itself at the Republican National Convention as hailing from the state with ""the largest military installations in the world."" North Carolina does have Fort Bragg, which has more active-duty troops than any base in the Army – or any other branch of the military, for that matter. Camp Lejeune is also large, although it’s not the biggest Marine Corps base anymore. In terms of physical size, none of the state’s bases are even close to the biggest. And its Air Force and Navy bases don’t stack up in any category of largeness. A little bit of bluster is to be expected during roll call statements, which are often filled with local pride. But North Carolina’s, while exaggerated, has definite merit – due in large part to Fort Bragg. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096790440>],/factchecks/2016/jul/21/north-carolina-republican-party/does-north-carolina-have-largest-military-bases/

Mike Pence stretches claim of record education spending in Indiana at Republican convention
","Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence joked at his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention that most people don’t know who he is. So he offered up his record as Indiana’s governor, an office he’s held since January 2013. Pence claimed that Indiana has ""the highest credit rating in the nation."" In a separate fact-check, we rated that Mostly True. He also boasted that he oversaw ""record investments in education."" ""In my home state of Indiana, we prove every day that you can build a growing economy on balanced budgets, low taxes, even while making record investments in education and roads and health care,"" Pence said in his July 20 remarks. We were curious whether Pence, currently in his third year as Indiana’s governor, really has passed ""record investments in education.""   Well, it depends on how you count it. In raw dollars, Pence’s claim holds up. But when adjusted for inflation, education spending at its highest point under Pence is still lower than it was in 2010 and 2011, before Pence took office. We got some help from Larry DeBoer, a professor of agricultural economics at Indiana’s Purdue University who has compiled state budget data. Prior to Pence, Indiana education spending for K-12 and higher education combined peaked at $9.3 billion in 2011, according to DeBoer’s data. Not adjusting for inflation, education spending has surpassed that peak every year from 2014 on. Estimated spending in the current fiscal year tops $10 billion. But adjusted for inflation, estimated spending for the current fiscal year is about 1.1 percent less than it was in 2011. The graph below shows raw dollar spending in blue and inflation-adjusted spending in red. (For calculating the inflation-adjusted spending, DeBoer used 1982-84 dollars according to the Consumer Price Index.)  While education spending under Pence is certainly on the rise, the pace of that increase proves not to be so dramatic when adjusted for inflation. Also, the graph appears to show a huge jump in spending leading into 2010. DeBoer noted that this reflects a big change in the spending structure among the state and localities, so it’s not useful to compare education spending today to pre-2010. One more way to put the state’s education spending in context is to look at its size compared with the Indiana economy. Education spending as a share of total Indiana income has been on a consistent decline since 2010, but it is becoming a bigger share of the state budget overall, DeBoer noted. Our ruling Pence said that as Indiana governor, he has made ""record investments in education."" In raw dollars, Pence’s statement is accurate. However, when adjusted for inflation, education spending at its highest point under Pence is still lower than it was in 2010 and 2011, though only marginally so. Pence’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097087340>],/factchecks/2016/jul/21/mike-pence/mike-pence-stretches-claim-record-education-spendi/

Mike Pence touts top Indiana credit rating achieved before he became governor
","Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the Republican nominee for vice president, introduced himself to the nation during a speech at the Republican convention in Cleveland by trying to show that he knows how to handle big budgets. A five-term member of Congress who assumed the governorship three and a half years ago. Pence contrasted the federal government's $19 trillion debt to his state's finances. ""We in Indiana have a $2 billion surplus, the highest credit rating in the nation, even though we've cut taxes every year since I became governor four years ago,"" he told the crowd. Measuring a governor by his state’s credit rating is something we hear often. People criticized New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for his state’s credit rating while former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tried (and failed) to use Florida’s credit rating to his benefit. A credit rating is an assessment of a state’s ability to repay its lenders, not just today but for years to come. The opinion, issued by ratings agencies, matters because the lower the rating, the higher the interest rate the state faces when it wants to borrow money. It’s kind of like a credit score for states. So what’s the story with Indiana and Pence? Pence is correct that Indiana has the highest credit rating a state can receive, though you can also say there a lot of states tied for first place. The three ratings agencies — Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch Ratings — have given Indiana its highest credit rating, AAA, since April 2010  Not only Indiana The most recent long-term compilation of state-by-state credit ratings we found was compiled by the Pew Charitable Trusts. Pew tracked the ratings from Standard & Poor’s, from 2001 through May 2014. It shows that Indiana's rating is AAA, the highest. But several other states share that distinction as well. As of May 2014, 14 other states also had AAA ratings. Pew noted that three states — Missouri, North Carolina and Virginia — have held a AAA credit rating for at least 50 years. Pre-dated Pence Indiana maintained AAA status during Pence’s term. But it achieved that feat before Pence took office. Pence became governor in January 2013. State officials say Indiana had a top credit rating since 2010. A Dec. 4, 2012, report from the state's public finance director says the AAA Fitch rating was earned in April 2010, the same time Moody's Investor Services, the third major rating agency, upgraded Indiana's credit rating to Aaa from Aa1. The Northwest Indiana Times reported at the time of those credit upgrades that the Fitch and Moody’s ratings went up because both agencies had recalibrated their rating systems for states. Our ruling Pence said, ""We in Indiana have ... the highest credit rating in the nation."" It actually shares that distinction with several other states and those top ratings predate Pence's governorship by a few years or more. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/45b7ec67-5d4a-4ad0-bf5d-21983a4a7573",[<zip object at 0x000002809C08BF40>],/factchecks/2016/jul/21/mike-pence/mike-pence-touts-top-indiana-credit-rating-achieve/
