No evidence 449,000 noncitizens were registered to vote in California
","A viral Facebook post that has peppered social media for at least a year was given fresh life last month when former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin shared it on her account.  ""449,000 Californians turned down jury duty because they were not citizens… but they WERE registered voters,"" reads the text of the Oct. 2 post. ""Let that sink in."" This post, which has been shared more than 57,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  After searching online and in the Nexis news archive, we couldn’t find this statistic in any news coverage. So we started reaching out to California officials.  Sam Mahood, a spokesperson for California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, told us he couldn’t comment on how many Californians declined jury duty on citizenship grounds — that’s not the office’s purview — but he said it’s not true that 449,000 noncitizens were registered to vote.  Here’s what else you should know about potential jurors in California.  First, people who are summoned for jury duty don’t ""turn it down,"" said Blaine Corren, a public affairs analyst for the Judicial Council of California. Rather, they can be excused from jury duty for various reasons, or a court can disqualify them from serving based on a number of factors including not being 18 or older, having a felony conviction on their record or for not being a citizen of the United States.  The council collects statewide data on how many people were excused or disqualified and why — with some caveats. That information comes to the council from individual trial courts but since there’s no requirement that courts provide this data, some courts and categories may be missing in the Jury Data Reports the council produces.  The data the state keeps on why someone was excused from jury duty includes financial hardship and physical or mental disabilities, but not citizenship status. The Judicial Council of California does, however, keep track of how many people were disqualified for jury duty because they’re not citizens. We requested the council’s reports through the most recent fiscal year for which a completed report is available, which was July 2017-June 2018. Our analysis shows that, annually, around 1 million people — citizens and noncitizens — are disqualified from jury duty in California. Approximately half aren’t citizens. From July 2008 through June 2017, about 11.3 million people were disqualified. Of those, about 4.7 million were disqualified for not being a U.S. citizen.  In 2017-2018, 1,063,784 people overall were disqualified with 425,814 for not being citizens. But it was fiscal year 2016-17 that has a figure that comes closest to the claim in the Facebook post: Among 1,096,478 people who were disqualified for jury duty that year, 449,404 were disqualified for not being U.S. citizens.  But that doesn’t mean that those rejected juror candidates were registered to vote.  One of the primary sources courts use to summon jurors is the voter registration list, Corren said. The other is the state Department of Motor Vehicles’ list of licensed drivers and identification card holders in the area served by the court. Noncitizens, such as lawful permanent residents, can get driver’s licenses. As of 2015, undocumented immigrants in California can, too. So it follows that noncitizens — both lawful permanent residents and undocumented immigrants — would be summoned for jury duty as courts tap potential jurors from DMV data. ""These two lists are considered inclusive of a representative cross-section of the population, according to the California Code of Civil Procedure,"" Corren said. But, he added, courts could seek jurors from other sources like telephone directories and utility company lists.  In Nevada County, Calif., for example, 97 potential jurors were excused because they weren’t citizens, said Jason Galkin, court executive officer of the Superior Court there. Galkin said the county tapped them from a list it got from the DMV. But searching for their names on the voter registration list, he said, there were no matches. In fiscal year 2017-2018, three Sierra County residents were dismissed from jury duty because they weren’t citizens but none of them were registered voters, said Jean-Anne Cheatham, a court assistant there.  Karen Dalton, a spokesperson for the San Diego County Superior Court, told us most courts in California use the DMV’s driver’s license database as its primary source for the jury master list and then augment that with the voter registrar's list. In California, noncitizens can get driver’s licenses so, again, it follows that noncitizens would appear for jury duty in San Diego County, among others. The DMV has a ""motor voter"" program that automatically registers eligible driver’s license applicants unless they opt out. Sometimes, Corren said, people will inadvertently mark themselves down to register to vote and it’s possible that the lists courts receive from the DMV include these individuals. That information also goes to the California Secretary of State’s office to determine whether to add them to the voter rolls, according to Corren. The office then reviews the lists and cancels requests to register to vote from people who aren’t eligible, he said.  Three Republican voters recently sued Secretary of State Padilla over the ""motor voter"" program, claiming that the state enables voter fraud by failing to investigate voters’ citizenship status, Courthouse News Service reported on Oct. 1.  Since the DMV started automatically registering people to vote in April 2018, it acknowledged making 105,000 processing errors out of more than 2.4 million, according to a January Sacramento Bee story, and at least one noncitizen came forward to say he was improperly added to the voter rolls. But that doesn’t mean that 105,000 noncitizens cast ballots. Sam Mahood, with the secretary of state’s office, told us he doesn’t know of any recent convictions for noncitizens registering to vote.  It’s also a far cry from the Facebook post’s claim: that 449,000 noncitizens were registered voters who had also been summoned for jury duty and turned it down.  We rate this post False.",/factchecks/2019/nov/11/viral-image/no-evidence-449000-noncitizens-were-registered-vot/

Post on Facebook spreads myths about the platform’s birthday fundraiser feature
","You’ve seen the posts on your timeline –– Facebook friends asking for donations to a charity of their choosing in lieu of birthday wishes or presents. But one post circulating on the social media website warns users against using the Facebook feature to make donations. The post begins with, ""Do you know what really happens when you donate your birthday to charity on Facebook?"" It goes on to say:  ""1. Even as a charity donations broker, officially Facebook is allowed to say they donated it themselves as a corporate entity. 2. As a corporate entity, Facebook is allowed to declare your donation for a tax write off. 3. Facebook gets to brag in the media how much they donated to charity, even though it was your money. 4. As a charitable donations broker, by law, they only need to actually deliver 15% of your donation to the charity organization you have chosen. DON’T DONATE TO CHARITY VIA FACEBOOK!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This isn’t true.  Facebook is a donation platform, and one that people appear to be using a lot. The company in September 2019 announced that since 2015, 45 million people have raised over $2 billion on the platform, with over $1 billion of that total coming from birthday fundraisers. What Facebook is not is a ""charity donations broker"" (in fact, charity experts told us they’ve never heard that term before). The organization told us it does not declare users’ donations as tax write-offs, nor does it deliver only 15% of a person’s intended donation to the charity specified.  Facebook members can access more than 750,000 nonprofit organizations using the social media donations platform. Facebook says it vets organizations by checking their 501(c)(3) status, IRS registration and tax ID numbers. Each nonprofit’s Facebook page also includes a link to its detailed profile on GuideStar, an organization that tracks nonprofits using a database designed to help paint a picture of a nonprofit’s activities and health. Facebook spokesperson Roya Winner told PolitiFact in an email that the post’s claims are ""completely false."" ""Facebook never claims any user’s donations as our own, nor are we a ‘charity donations broker.’ We are a donation platform and payments to charities are processed by our licensed, regulated subsidiaries,"" Winner said. ""A donation to a nonprofit through its Facebook Page or a fundraiser on Facebook may be tax-deductible for the person who made the donation.""  The Facebook help center has a page explaining whether a particular donation is tax-deductible. It explains that since tax laws vary by country and region, users should consult a tax professional and review laws in their area to determine whether their donation is tax-deductible.  The website also says that after a donation is made through the platform, a confirmation is sent to the email listed on that person’s Facebook account. The confirmation shows the person made the donation as a charitable contribution, includes the nonprofit’s EIN number, and states that the donor is not receiving any goods or services in return. But what about the claim that Facebook, by law, only needs to deliver ""15% of your donation to the charity organization you have chosen?"" That’s also bogus.  ""100% of what’s raised using donate buttons and fundraisers created on Facebook goes to the benefiting nonprofit,"" Winner wrote in an email. ""Nonprofits either receive funds directly from Facebook, or via Network for Good, a Donor Advised Fund we partner with."" These are the two main ways nonprofits can raise funds on Facebook.   When a nonprofit enrolls in Facebook Payments, it has to raise at least $100 (per nonprofit, not per fundraiser) before it receives a payout directly to its bank account. Funds will roll over until the payout amount reaches the $100 minimum, and the payment process takes about two weeks, Facebook says. The organization should receive the donation about a month after it is made. For nonprofits not registered with Facebook Payments, donations can be dispersed through fundraising platforms Network for Good (used for the U.S, Canada and Australia) or PayPal Giving Fund (used for other international organizations). Network for Good can take 45-75 days for a donation to be received. For PayPal Giving Fund, it’s between 15-90 days. Only nonprofits that are onboarded through Facebook Payments, or through Network for Good or Paypal Giving Fund, are able to fundraise on Facebook. Though some may worry that such contributions made to charities using the for-profit Facebook platform may not be tax-deductible, Winner told us that concern is unfounded.  ""That’s an inaccurate representation, the donation goes to the organization, not Facebook,"" she said. ""It is stated as a charitable contribution to the specific nonprofit on the confirmation receipt, along with the organization’s EIN number."" Facebook covers all fees for donations made on its website to charitable organizations. In November 2017, the company announced it would drop the 5% transaction fee on donations to nonprofits on its platform. Facebook once had a 4.3% platform fee for personal fundraisers –– which allows people to host their own fundraiser for a personal cause –– but it eliminated that in May 2018. Personal fundraisers are now subject to a 2.6% payment processing fee plus $0.30. In some countries, additional taxes will be deducted when the money raised is distributed. The fees broken down by country can be found here.  A Facebook post tells people not to donate to nonprofits via Facebook’s birthday fundraiser feature, claiming the company can claim the donation as a tax write-off, and only has to deliver 15% of the donation to the organization. This is not accurate. Facebook is a donation platform and told us it doesn’t claim users donations, nor does it only deliver 15% of each contribution. It charges a 2.6% payment processing fee on personal fundraisers –– not nonprofits –– and eliminated a 5% transaction fee on donations to nonprofit organizations in 2017.

What does the law say about children and sex reassignment surgery?
","During an Oct. 31 press conference, leaders from conservative advocacy organizations in Texas urged Gov. Greg Abbott to call a special legislative session to elect a new House speaker.  Earlier that month, embattled House Speaker Dennis Bonnen announced that he would not seek re-election to his seat in the House.  The activists also outlined policy proposals that they want lawmakers to address during a special session, proposals they say Republican leaders failed to pursue during the regular session earlier this year. Cindi Castilla, president of the Dallas Eagle Forum, said lawmakers need to take steps to limit what gender transition treatments are available to children, in light of an ongoing legal battle in Dallas over the gender identity of a 7-year-old. ""During our last session, our legislators decided to pass a law protecting Texans from e-cigarettes until they reach the age of 21,"" she said. ""They left children able to be sterilized and mutilated at any point in their life. This was a failing, and we need a remedy. ""Texas Eagle Forum asked lawmakers to carry a very common-sense bill that would protect young Texans. That bill would have protected (the child), no matter what the verdict was going to be from the courts."" Before we dive into this check, it should be noted that medical or surgical treatments used by doctors for transitioning must meet the same safety requirements of other medications or surgeries. To suggest that any child might be mutilated by doctors is inaccurate. ""Children in Texas are already robustly protected by the Texas Family Code and medical rules of ethics,"" said Brian Klosterboer, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, in a statement. ""No one in Texas may harm a child, including parents and medical professionals.""  When reached via email, Castilla said that she is unaware of any state laws that ""protect children from being given treatments that can lead to sterilization and no law prohibiting surgeries that would seek to make a child appear to be a gender different than the gender they were born.""  ""Thus far, it appears very young children have been protected from this only because of the good sense of the medical community,"" she said. ""As we see this protection waning among a small portion of the medical community we would like to make sure that the most vulnerable Texans are protected.""  Castilla said the bill she mentioned at the press conference would have ""protected children from these procedures,"" but the group could not find a lawmaker to carry the legislation. Dallas custody case The legal battle in Dallas that Castilla mentioned in her remarks is a custody dispute between a mother and father that centers on the gender identity of their 7-year-old child.  The child’s mother says the 7-year-old is a transgender girl and wants to dress as a girl and be identified by female pronouns — a process referred to as a social transition. The child’s father disagrees and insists that the child is a boy.  The case has spurred a national debate about children and their gender identities, with some Texas Republicans pledging to pursue legislation to prevent minors in Texas from transitioning by medical means.  Gillian Branstetter, spokeswoman for the National Center for Transgender Equality, said an important point to consider in this case is the child’s age. ""This child is 7 years old,"" she said, noting that ""no one is talking about"" pursuing a medical or surgical transition. ""We’re talking about gender affirming parenting and letting the child explore who they are."" Looking at the law Under federal law, transition-related medical care is considered the same as any other medically-necessary care and carries the same requirements when it comes to minors, according to Branstetter and attorneys with ACLU of Texas. Generally speaking, Texas law dictates that parents have a ""duty"" to provide medical and dental care to their children and they have the ""right"" to consent to that care.  But pursuing gender transition treatment is an individualized process for transgender and gender non-binary people and can take many forms, according to multiple resources on gender identity and gender dysphoria. People with gender dysphoria — when a person feels a conflict between the gender they were assigned at birth and the gender with which they identify — choose to act on this in different ways.  This can include wearing clothes and using pronouns associated with their gender identity; changing their gender and name on legal documents; pursuing hormone treatment or surgical options available for transitioning.  Not every person who has gender dysphoria and is transgender will pursue medical or surgical transition treatment. People can be diagnosed with gender dysphoria at any age, even as children.  ""While some children express feelings and behaviors relating to gender dysphoria at 4 years old or younger, many may not express feelings and behaviors until puberty or much later,"" reads an article on the subject from the American Psychiatric Association. ""For some children, when they experience puberty, they suddenly find themselves unable to identify with their own body. Medical treatment standards prioritize affirmation When it comes to caring for children who might be exhibiting signs of gender dysphoria, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the ""gender-affirmative care model"" that prioritizes validating a child’s gender identity and supporting their exploration and expression of that identity. ""There are absolutely no medical interventions or surgical interventions on any prepubertal child,"" said Colt Keo-Meier, a Texas-based psychologist and author who specializes in gender and sexual health. ""That is not happening."" The widely accepted ""Standards of Care"" maintained by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health also emphasize this point. ""Before any physical interventions are considered for adolescents, extensive exploration of psychological, family, and social issues should be undertaken,"" the standards read. ""The duration of this exploration may vary considerably depending on the complexity of the situation."" Once a child starts puberty, other options emerge. Keo-Meier said the most common treatment — medication to delay the onset of puberty — is fully reversible. ""That is literally just hitting pause,"" he said. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health outline minimum criteria that must be met before a child can receive puberty-suppressing medication, including that the child has demonstrated a ""long-lasting and intense pattern of gender nonconformity or gender dysphoria"" and that it ""emerged or worsened with the onset of puberty."" Other, interventions like hormone therapy (partially reversible) or surgery (irreversible) won’t be considered until a patient reaches adolescence. Even then, the Standards of Care stress that certain procedures should not be performed until a patient is old enough to consent on their own (typically 16-18 years old) and others should occur only once a person has received other treatments for a specific time period. Our Ruling Castilla said state lawmakers ""left children able to be sterilized and mutilated at any point in their life"" by failing to adopt a law prohibiting minors from undergoing medical or surgical gender transitions. Castilla is right that there is no law regulating transition-related treatment separately from other medically-necessary care and the same age regulations apply — minors need parental consent. Widely accepted guidelines for transition care emphasize gender-affirming care and therapy as primary tools for children. More intensive options, like surgery or hormone treatment, are typically reserved for older adolescents (with parental consent) and adults.

Donald Trump Jr. overstates migration out of New York
","Democrats in New York responded with glee to the news that President Donald Trump is trading in his status as a New Yorker to declare himself a resident of Florida. Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared ""good riddance,"" to which Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., said, ""Nice soundbite. Now do the tens of thousands of other successful New Yorkers and businesses fleeing your idiotic policies every week. I’ll wait.""   Nice soundbite. Now do the tens of thousands of other successful New Yorkers and businesses fleeing your idiotic policies every week. I’ll wait.Also I don’t remember this sentiment ever stopping you from coming to @realDonaldTrump’s office begging for $. I was there. GOOD TIMES https://t.co/jDbK3k9daY The possible reasons behind the president’s decision to leave New York have been discussed and debated, but it has brought into the news once again New York’s longtime reputation as a place that people leave.   But is Trump Jr. correct? Are ""tens of thousands"" of people leaving every week?  We turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, which tracks migration among states. Last year, 458,014 people left New York for other states, an average of 8,808 people a week. Some 254,447 people moved into New York, so the result is a net out-migration of 203,567. The weekly average of people leaving drops to 3,915. In 2017, the results were similar.    This is consistent with what PolitiFact New York reported in 2017, that New York lost a net 191,367 people to other states between July 2015 and July 2016, or 3,680 people every week, on average. During that year, New York had a higher net out-migration than any other state.  When evaluating migration between states, it’s important to note in-migration too, said E.J. McMahon, founder and research director of the conservative Empire Center for Public Policy.  The raw ""out"" number is misleading, McMahon said. Census data show that Florida lost even more people to other states — 470,977 in 2018 alone. Texas lost almost the same number. The crucial question is how many moved into those states, he said. Florida, which departing New Yorkers prefer over any other state, took in 587,261 from other states, for a net migration gain of 116,284.  On the question of whether ""successful"" people leave, Professor Cristobal Young, who studies migration at Cornell University, said that people with incomes of $100,000 or greater do leave New York, but that their departure ""creates a vacancy in opportunity, that other people fill and prosper from.""  In 2017, from a base population of 3.7 million top earners, around 48,000 moved to New York, while around 84,000 left New York for other states, for a net out-migration of about 36,000, Young said. However, New York in general does not see a decline in top earners despite this migration, because the domestic production of top earners is very high, in other words, many more people become successful in New York, raising the number of top earners, he said.   We did not rate Trump Jr.’s assertion that businesses are also leaving New York in droves, because comprehensive data on business moves between states are not available.  ""In general, businesses don’t simply ‘leave’ any state in large numbers,"" McMahon said. ""When they are large enough, they can be sold to a firm in another state, or they expand into another state, or they contract or consolidate into another state, or they simply go out of business.""  A spokesman for Donald Trump Jr. declined to comment for this factcheck.  Earlier this year, more than a quarter of New Yorkers surveyed told pollsters from Quinnipiac University that they expected that they would have to leave in the next five years for better economic opportunities elsewhere.   The March poll found that 35 percent of voters surveyed expected they would have to leave. However, expecting to leave and ""fleeing"" are two different things. There are roughly 12 million registered voters in New York, and 35 percent is 4.2 million. Spread out over five years, that would be 16,000 people per week.  Trump Jr. claimed people are leaving New York because of ""idiotic policies"" enacted by Cuomo. However, the reasons for migration are difficult to pin down. Earlier this year, PolitiFact Florida fact-checked why New Yorkers are drawn to Florida and did not find enough evidence to show to what extent taxes play a role. Some research suggests that family, the weather and jobs are prime motivators. Donald Trump Jr. tweeted that ""tens of thousands"" of people leave New York every week.  Census data show that when counting only the people who move to other states, the number reached 8,808 per week on average in 2018. That figure falls to 3,915 when including the number of people moving into New York from other states.  We rate Trump Jr.’s claim False.      ",/factchecks/2019/nov/08/donald-trump-jr/donald-trump-jr-overstates-migration-out-new-york/

"['Population', 'Illinois', 'JB Pritzker']","
Has Illinois been losing population for nearly a century?
","In 2018, the U.S. Census Bureau released figures showing the population of Illinois had declined for a fifth year in a row. The year before, it fell behind Pennsylvania as the nation’s fifth-largest state. The string of recent declines has generated considerable debate, with politicians frequently spinning it to buttress their own policy arguments. This summer, we rated False a claim in which a Republican state lawmaker said Illinois lost middle-class families after the state instituted its last income tax hike. And in years past, Democrats attacked former Gov. Bruce Rauner over the population loss that occurred under his watch. During a sit-down interview at FIA’s annual futures and options expo in Chicago, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker brought up the downward trend while highlighting the work his administration is doing to make higher education more affordable. ""People talk about the exodus from Illinois and they’ve blamed it on a lot of things, because we’ve lost population,"" Pritzker said. ""Illinois lost population in 94 out of the last 95 years, so it’s not like it’s a new thing that we have a slight out-trickle of people leaving the state. Nevertheless, I’d like to reverse it. And so, the best way to do that is actually to keep our students here and attract students to our universities."" Has Illinois, which is still the nation’s sixth-largest state, lost population almost every year for most of the past century? And what, exactly, does Pritzker mean by ""lost population?"" The first and most specific part of Pritzker’s claim is contradicted by annual population estimates maintained by the federal government. Illinois’ overall population has grown — not declined — in all but 15 of the past 95 years for which the U.S. Census Bureau has data. In 1924, Illinois’ population was 7.2 million, while in 2018, 12.7 million resided in the state. Figures for 2019 have not yet been released. So if population has gone up for most of the past century, what was Pritzker talking about? We asked his spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh, who told us the governor wasn’t referring to total population but ""net domestic migration,"" which is a subset of overall population that measures the difference between the number of people who move into Illinois from another state versus those who move out of Illinois to other states. If more people leave Illinois than arrive from other states, it’s considered net domestic out-migration, a definition that jibes with the second half of Pritzker’s comment about a ""slight out-trickle"" of Illinois residents. And a 2016 report authored by some of the state’s most prominent tax policy experts suggest he’s correct that net domestic out-migration isn’t a new phenomenon. Aside from a small increase in 1947, the last time more people moved from other states into Illinois than out of it was 1920, according to the report, which drew on estimates compiled from multiple federal sources by migration expert Lyman Stone. ""Illinois has reliably had negative net domestic migration for a century,"" Stone told us in an email. That also tracks with an analysis of census population estimates conducted by Brookings Institution demographer William Frey in response to our inquiry. He found Illinois has experienced net domestic out-migration annually since 2000, the earliest year for which he had comparable data. While domestic out-migration has driven Illinois’ recent decline, however, Frey cautioned it’s still just one piece of the puzzle when looking at changes in population over time. It’s a metric that does not account for international migration, which Illinois and other large states such as New York and California have relied on for population gains. Nor does it include increases from the number of births that occur in a state. Pritzker said ""Illinois lost population in 94 out of the last 95 years, so it’s not like it’s a new thing that we have a slight out-trickle of people leaving the state."" The state saw declines in its overall population in just 15 of the last 95 years for which the federal government has released estimates, which contradicts part of the governor’s claim on its face.

No, Jeb Bush didn’t say “Ok boomer” to Donald Trump
","A 25-year-old New Zealand politician recently dismissed a senior lawmaker who interrupted her speech on climate change with two words: ""OK boomer."" The retort to older people who just don’t get it has gone mainstream, but don’t be fooled into thinking former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said it to his one-time political rival.  An image shared on Facebook on Nov. 4 appears to show Bush tweeting ""Ok boomer"" in response to Trump’s tweet characterizing the impeachment inquiry as a ""Scam and Witch Hunt."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Yes, Bush is only 66 to Trump’s 73, but reviewing his Twitter feed on Oct. 9 we found no such tweet. Rather, he responded to a tweet from Michael Morrell, the former acting and deputy director of the CIA. Morrell said: ""The Turkish military is about to move into Syria. President Trump allowed this to happen. An ethnic cleansing of our Kurdish allies, a boost to ISIS, and a foreign policy gift to Russia, Iran, & China will be the result. America’s standing in the world will take an immense hit.""  Bush retweeted Morrell and wrote, ""This is a tragedy.""  He also retweeted New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, an Illinois congressman, and U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham. Searching on Twitchy, which keeps tabs on high-profile people who delete their tweets, we didn’t find evidence that Bush tweeted and then deleted. We also didn’t find any evidence searching for echoes of the tweet more broadly online. Finally, we searched the Nexis news archive for ""Jeb Bush"" and ""Donald Trump"" and ""Ok boomer"" and got no matches.

No evidence Jefferson said ‘government will one day be corrupt and filled with liars’
","An alleged quote by Founding Father and former President Thomas Jefferson is circulating on social media. The post in question features a photo of a crowded arena attended by folks in red caps.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is one of many fictitious statements that have been attributed to Jefferson on the internet over the years. Like others we have fact-checked, there is no evidence he said or wrote it. The quote, or any variation of it, could not be found in a search of the Papers of Thomas Jefferson. A search for it in the Jefferson encyclopedia and collections of his writings and speeches online yielded no results. The Jefferson library at Monticello, his Virginia estate, reported that the quote started being linked to the third president online in about 2015. ""This quotation has not been found in the writings of Thomas Jefferson,"" Monticello research research librarian Anna Berkes wrote on the Monticello website. ""It seems to exist mainly on Twitter, but we have been unable to trace its existence before 2015."" We reached out to Berkes to check if she has come across any variation of it since. She told us the quote still can’t be located. ""All signs point to it being entirely spurious,"" Berkes wrote in an email. ""Usually with a genuine quote, you’ll see it appearing in books by historians or previous compilations of Jefferson’s writings; this one still doesn’t seem to have any paper trail at all."" Berkes also wrote a blog post in 2011 to help people know how to spot fake Jefferson quotes. Among her tips: Jefferson almost never used contractions nor did he use the word ""you"" as an indefinite pronoun. Berkes also warned readers to be wary of quotes that have no citation as to when and where it was said and those that can only be found in non-historical literature.

Florida GOP chair twists’ response by Democrats at debate on health care for undocumented immigrants
","The leaders of Florida’s two major political parties squared off less than a year before Election Day, throwing partisan jabs over health care and immigration. Florida Democratic Party chairwoman Terrie Rizzo called out Republican efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act established under former President Barack Obama. Republican Party of Florida chairman Joe Gruters said it is Democrats with a health care problem. Gruters, a state senator from Sarasota, referenced the first presidential primary debate in June, in which moderators asked the crowded field to raise their hands if they supported certain positions. ""All the Democrats on the entire stage — every Democratic candidate said they want to give free health care to illegals,"" Gruters said during a Tampa Bay Times forum Nov. 6. ""That’s them saying, that’s what they said in the debate. It wasn’t me saying it. They raised their hands — every single one of them — free health care for illegals."" In the middle of his reply, Rizzo said: ""Fact-check it!"" It wasn’t the first time PolitiFact heard this claim. President Donald Trump used a similar attack in a July ad for his re-election campaign, and it rates Mostly False. Gruters’ statement is not more accurate, and here’s why. At the first Democratic presidential debate in Miami in June, NBC debate moderator and Today show cohost Savannah Guthrie asked a group of candidates to ""raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants."" All candidates on stage raised their hands. They weren’t all the candidates, because the first presidential debate was split into two nights. On the stage were author Marianne Williamson, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, and Rep. Eric Swalwell of California. (Hickenlooper, Gillibrand and Swalwell have dropped out.) The candidates were not asked if that coverage would be free. Guthrie then asked two candidates — Buttigieg and Biden — to comment. Neither one said they would give ""free"" health care to undocumented immigrants. Buttigieg spoke about people buying into a system and said that undocumented immigrants pay certain taxes. ""This is not about a handout,"" Buttigieg said. ""This is an insurance program."" Biden agreed, and spoke about the contributions by undocumented immigrants, including paying taxes.  So the debate Gruters mentioned doesn’t actually support what Gruters claimed. But there is some question about how Medicare for All, a proposal some of the Democratic candidates support, would treat health care costs for undocumented immigrants. Sanders’ version is a single, national health insurance program that would cover everyone who lives in the United States. There would be no out-of-pocket costs to individuals — no deductibles, no copays or coinsurance — but anyone with a job or self-employed would pay into the system through taxes. In that sense, coverage would not be free for anyone who works. (Some immigrants in the country illegally pay income taxes.) Sanders’ 2019 Medicare for All bill states that all residents — without specifying legal residents — are entitled to the benefits and that the health and human services secretary shall set criteria to determine residency.  Sanders’ immigration plan says Medicare for All will ""provide comprehensive care to everyone in America, regardless of immigration status."" It also calls for employers to follow labor laws when employing undocumented immigrants, which suggests that they would pay the payroll tax. However, some of the other Democrats on the debate stage specifically responded to a New York Times questionnaire with replies that showed the coverage would not be free. Buttigieg, Bennet and Yang said undocumented immigrants would have the option to buy coverage through a public option, the insurance marketplace, or Medicare for All, respectively. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the top contenders and another advocate for Medicare for All, was not on the debate stage that night. (She went the night before.)  Her detailed financial plan for Medicare for All includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, which would increase federal revenue for Medicare for All as new people come into the system and pay taxes. When PolitiFact told Gruters what we found — mainly that the debate question did not include the condition that it would be free coverage — he replied: ""Illegal Immigrants have little more than what they are carrying with them when they cross the border, so as a result the only logical conclusion is that it would be free."" Gruters said, ""All the Democrats on the entire stage — every Democratic candidate said they want to give free health care to illegals."" The question from the debate moderator did not specify if coverage for undocumented immigrants would be free. Two candidates who elaborated on their responses — Biden and Buttigieg — said these immigrants would be eligible to buy into their system.

Wisconsin Democrat's claim about reliance on Planned Parenthood for health care is in the ballpark
","It’s hard to have a health care debate without mentioning Planned Parenthood. The organization has been caught in the middle of a years-long partisan battle over federal funding for the nonprofit organization, which is the largest abortion provider in the country.  In August 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued rules that would bar health clinics from receiving any federal funding if they provide or refer patients for abortions with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a medical emergency. Several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have already pledged to provide funding for Planned Parenthood if they’re in office.  The organization, which has over 600 locations nationwide and 24 in Wisconsin, according to Wisconsin Public Radio, provides reproductive health care to patients, including those who are low-income or underinsured. In response to the Trump administration’s action, U.S. Rep Mark Pocan, D-Madison, sent out this tweet:  ""In WI, over 79% of Title X patients rely on Planned Parenthood for their basic health care."" Is Pocan right?  Title X vs. Trump administration Let’s start with some background.  Title X is a federal grant program that serves low-income patients or those who don’t have health insurance.  It was first enacted in 1970 and signed into law by President Richard Nixon. The program distributes about $260 million a year in family planning grants. The program helps provide patients with cancer screenings, STD testing and annual exams for women, but it does not fund abortion care. Instead of complying with the new rules, Planned Parenthood decided to pull out of the federal program, saying that forcing Title X providers to stop referring abortions would be unfair to patients and limit their access to reproductive health options. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization operating out of Washington D.C. and New York City that studies and advocates for the advancement of sexual and reproductive health and rights, Title X-funded providers serve about 3.8 million contraceptive clients.  Of that group, 1.6 million are served by Planned Parenthood centers.  The claim When asked for backup, Pocan spokesman Conor McCabe told us the congressman took the 79% figure from a Planned Parenthood graphic. Planned Parenthood told us the Wisconsin statistics came from the Democratic staff of the U.S. Senate’s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee.  According to that research, there were 19 Title-X funded sites -- not limited to Planned Parenthood -- operating in Wisconsin in 2015. Collectively, the sites provided contraceptive care to nearly 31,000 women across the state.  Planned Parenthood health centers served 79 percent of these women.  That does not exactly close the case, however. Pocan’s claim said those patients rely on Planned Parenthood ""for their basic health care."" That brings to mind such things as annual check-ups and flu shots.  But Title X doesn’t cover any of that, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The money is strictly for reproductive health care.  ""Title X funds only cover services that prevent or help to achieve pregnancy,"" said Mia Heck, director of external affairs at HHS.  Among the services covered: birth control, STD screenings, emergency contraception, breast exams, cervical cancer screenings and abortions. One can argue those are considered basic care when it comes to reproductive issues. But Pocan’s tweet used it more broadly, which was misleading. To be sure, Planned Parenthood does provide more general health care. Among the things it offers, according to its website: physicals, anemia testing and screenings for colon cancer, diabetes and cholesterol levels. Certainly some Title X patients may get general care at Planned Parenthood clinics. But that care is not paid for by Title X, as Pocan suggests.  Our ruling Pocan said ""In WI, over 79% of Title X patients rely on Planned Parenthood for their basic health care."" We found these numbers match data collected for a U.S. Senate committee, and used by Planned Parenthood itself. But Pocan’s claim was a bit off by framing the debate around ""basic health care."" Title X funds are limited to reproductive health care issues, not such things as physicals, flu shots and other general matters for which people might see a doctor. Our definition for Mostly True is: ""The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.""  That fits here.",/factchecks/2019/nov/08/mark-pocan/wisconsin-democrats-claim-about-reliance-planned-p/

The post, which has been shared more than 79,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Here are the facts.  Vince Foster, deputy White House counsel to then-President Bill Clinton, killed himself on July 20, 1993, at Fort Marcy Park in Virginia.  His death was grist for the conspiracy theory mill. Critics of the Clintons speculated that the Clintons had killed Foster. Dan Burton, then a Republican congressman from Indiana, ""famously shot a melon in his backyard to ‘prove’ that Foster couldn’t have killed himself,"" an Esquire story says. An autopsy concluded that he committed suicide, according to the story, but Foster’s death still drew the attention of, among others, Brett Kavanaugh before he was a Supreme Court justice.  Back then, Kavanaugh was on independent counsel Ken Starr’s team when it looked into whether Foster was murdered. In early 1995, Kavanaugh offered Starr ""the legal rationale for expanding his investigation of the Arkansas financial dealings of President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, to include the Foster death,"" the Washington Post reported. ""Kavanaugh, then 30, argued that unsupported allegations that Foster may have been murdered gave Starr the right to probe the matter more deeply. Foster’s death had already been the focus of two investigations, both concluding that Foster committed suicide."" One investigation by then-special counsel Robert Fiske involved four lawyers, five physicians, seven FBI agents, approximately 125 witnesses, and DNA tests, the Washington Post reported in 1994. ""According to Fiske,"" the paper said, ""Foster’s death was a personal collapse, not a White House scandal."" He complained to his physician in Little Rock, Ark., about depression and anxiety, and his symptoms worsened when he got to Washington to work in the White House. After he bore some of the political fallout from an incident that became known as ""Travelgate,"" in which seven White House travel office employees were ""fired amid hints of financial shenanigans,"" he became ""increasingly obsessed"" with the affair and the possibility of a congressional hearing, the Washington Post said.  ""Though he was confident he and the White House had done nothing wrong,"" the paper wrote, ""he told his friend Webster L. Hubbell that ‘in Washington you are assumed to have done something wrong even if you have not.’"" After a series of critical editorials in the Wall Street Journal, he became more distraught, Fiske found. ""His anxiety over the congressional hearings deepened,"" according to the Post. He told his sister he was depressed. He ultimately shot himself once in the mouth with a gun.    Kavanaugh eventually affirmed the suicide finding and, in October 1997, Starr issued a report on Foster’s death and concluded that Foster killed himself. But today, conspiracies continue to flourish. In 2016, for example, President Donald Trump called Foster’s death ""very fishy.""   We rate this Facebook post False.",/factchecks/2019/nov/08/facebook-posts/decades-old-conspiracy-theories-about-vince-foster/

It is about the great transformation taking place around the world, a transformation that, though often discussed, remains poorly understood."" A Publishers Weekly review of the book called it ""a stimulating, largely optimistic forecast of where the 21st century is heading,"" saying that Zakaria ""predicts that despite its record of recent blunders at home and abroad, America will stay strong, buoyed by a stellar educational system and the influx of young immigrants, who give the U.S. a more youthful demographic than Europe and much of Asia whose workers support an increasing population of unproductive elderly.""

Absence of statewide school mask mandates does not mean 'living mask-free'

It includes a map of the United States with the majority of states colored green and a handful — mostly on the West and East coasts, plus Illinois and New Mexico — colored red, which means they have ""forced masking"" in schools, according to text on the post.

While mask mandates are not statewide in those places, individual schools and school districts within many of those states still have mandates. Texas is marked in green on the map. It has a mask-mandate ban that has been mired in court challenges, a common scenario across the country. Some Texas districts still require masks. For example, in the Austin Independent School District, everyone — students, staff and visitors — is required to wear a mask. ""School boards and mayors are not always in sync with state leaders, leaving many districts tied up in lengthy litigation over mask rules,"" the New York Times reported. Another example is North Carolina, also marked in green on the Instagram post map. The state does not have a statewide mask mandate, but individual school districts and charter schools can choose to require masks, and as of Feb. 11, several dozen districts were doing so, the News & Observer in Raleigh reported. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends indoor masking for all students ages 2 and older, and for staff and teachers, regardless of vaccination status. Claims that masks are harmful to children have been widely debunked, and science shows mask-wearing is largely safe for children. Further, the post misleadingly implies that the absence of masks equals a return to normal life at school, which is not the case. Many districts still have quarantine requirements for students who are close contacts of positive COVID-19 cases, which disrupt normal schooling. The CDC recommends five days’ quarantine for those exposed to COVID-19 who are not up-to-date on vaccinations, a category that includes many young children. Nationally, about 28% of children ages 5 to 11 had received one dose of COVID-19 vaccine as of Jan. 18, according to Kaiser Family Foundation.

Congress hasn't proposed traveling nurse pay cap, but asked for staffing agencies probe
","A letter sent to a White House official and signed by nearly 200 members of Congress from both parties has sparked concern among traveling nurses that legislators want to cap their pay. ""According to Congress, travel nurses need a pay cap,"" read a Feb.  7 Facebook post from one nurse, who added, ""Staff nurses aren’t paid enough, and the ones who left to travel and help are now being told they make too much. We were once heroic and now it’s back to reality."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There’s no evidence that these lawmakers are advocating a cap on nursing pay. But a group of lawmakers did ask federal officials to inspect the way staffing agencies charge healthcare facilities. And some states are considering capping what staffing agencies charge hospitals, which one industry expert said could lead to reductions in nursing pay. Traveling nurses have been in high demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. The job often comes with higher than average pay — sometimes two to three times higher — as an incentive to attract nurses to temporarily live and work in areas where there aren’t enough qualified nurses.  Two congressmen, Reps. Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont and Morgan Griffith, a Republican from Virginia, spearheaded the Jan. 24 letter to Jeff Zients, the White House’s COVID-19 response team coordinator, expressing concern that some staffing agencies are taking advantage of the pandemic to inflate their prices for profit. The lawmakers called for a federal investigation into the agencies’ pricing practices. The American Hospital Association, American Health Care Association and the National Center for Assisted Living sent a similar letter to Zients on Jan. 27, saying the staffing agencies are ""exploiting"" the facilities’ ""desperate"" needs for personnel.  ""The AHA and AHCA/NCAL have each urged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate this conduct as a violation of our antitrust or consumer protection laws but we have not yet received any response,"" the letter said, urging Zients to see that the matter ""gets the attention it merits from the federal government."" While both letters complained of the high rates staffing agencies are charging health care facilities to supply workers, neither mentioned capping pay for nurses or proposed any federal legislation that would cap pay. Griffith issued a statement on Feb. 5 to address what he called ""disinformation"" about the letter, saying that he has not introduced legislation to cap nurses’ pay, nor would he support any. ""The bipartisan letter I sent to the White House asks about potential illegal practices by staffing agencies that charge high rates and then keep that money for themselves, not nurses. Rumors are that middleman staffing agencies keep as much as 40% of the money they charge for nurses instead of giving more of the money to the nurses,"" he said. ""I do not and will not support legislation to cap nurses’ pay. Anything to the contrary is fake news."" Emily Becker, a spokesperson for Welch, said the congressman also is ""categorically opposed to pay caps for nurses, including travel nurses."" His office is ""not aware"" of any federal legislation proposed or in the works that would cap nurse pay and he ""would oppose such legislation,"" she said. Welch wants an investigation ""to determine whether there has been any improper behavior on the part of staffing agencies and the private equity firms that own them,"" said Becker, who pointed to an article by the health news publication STAT, with a headline about private equity firms cashing in on the traveling nursing business. An analysis by STAT showed that since early 2021, ""at least eight private equity firms have bought at least seven staffing agencies."" Welch has not heard back from the White House about the letter, Becker said. The American Health Care Association/National Center for Assisted Living said in a statement to PolitiFact that it also was not advocating for a pay cap for traveling nurses, but rather an investigation into ""potential anticompetitive practices"" by staffing agencies, who may be taking advantage of the pandemic and labor shortages, while only giving the nurses ""a fraction of what the agency is charging the facility."" The American Nurses Association, meanwhile, earlier this month issued a statement calling on Congress to address the root causes of nurse shortages. It applauded efforts to address any price gouging, as long as ""travel nurses are not negatively impacted in the process."" The median pay for registered nurses in 2020, the last year data was available, was about $75,000 per year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Salaries have risen for staff nurses as hospitals tried to attract workers and compete with staffing agencies, The Wall Street Journal reported. High demand has translated into higher pay from staffing agencies, which in turn pass their higher costs on to hospitals and nursing homes, said Toby Malara, the vice president of government relations for the American Staffing Association, a trade group for the U.S. staffing and recruiting industry. Malara said the higher prices are simply ""a matter of supply and demand driving the rates up."" Staffing agencies trying to attract nurses to high-demand areas must factor in higher costs of living in big cities and the risk for nurses working in COVID-19 hot spots, which he called ""akin to hazard pay."" He said that 75% of the rates staffing agencies charge hospitals help cover expenses like nurses’ wages, federal and state taxes, workers compensation and unemployment insurance, and benefits.  Malara said the ASA has not heard from the White House or the FTC about an investigation. An FTC spokesperson told PolitiFact that the agency does not comment on or confirm the existence of investigations. Malara said that he does not expect to see any federal legislation as a result of the letter from the legislators. But some states are considering rate caps on what staffing agencies can charge hospitals, which is in essence ""a salary cap on nurses because you're limiting what nurses can be paid,"" Malara said.  In Pennsylvania, Rep. Timothy Bonner introduced legislation in January that he said in a November memo ""would establish maximum rates on agency health care personnel to end the practice of ‘gouging’ the Medicaid program and Pennsylvania taxpayers."" Currently, only Massachusetts and Minnesota have state caps on what staffing agencies can charge healthcare facilities for nurses or other professionals, MedPage Today reported. Malara said staffing agencies struggle to recruit nurses in those states because they can go elsewhere for higher pay if the market demands it. A Facebook post said that ""according to Congress, travel nurses need a pay cap."" A group of nearly 200 legislators sent a letter to the White House asking for a federal investigation into what it called ""inflated"" prices that staffing agencies are charging hospitals to supply nurses. A similar letter was sent by hospital and nursing home groups. No investigation has been announced by the White House or FTC. However, the letters did not call for pay caps on what travel nurses make, nor has any legislation been proposed in Congress. The two main authors of the letter said they do not want to see lower pay for travel nurses as a result and would not support any legislation that proposes that. Some states are considering rate caps on what staffing agencies can charge hospitals and that could ultimately result in lowered salaries for nurses, an industry expert said. But that’s not what the Facebook post is claiming. We rate this claim False. CORRECTION, Feb. 17, 2022: U.S. Rep. Peter Welch is a Democrat.

The claim that Turning Point USA is a white nationalist group is False
","Efforts to start a Turning Point USA chapter at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa, sparked controversy on Feb. 7 among parents who were concerned about the conservative group’s views.  The proposed Johnston chapter, as well as a recent photo of Republican state legislators standing with high school students involved in Turning Point USA, has sparked debate about the organization, with opponents accusing it of being a hate group. In a tweet, Randy Richardson, an organizer with Iowans for Public Education — an organization that advocates for public schools and against school vouchers — referred to a Turning Point USA hub at Pleasant Valley Middle School when tweeting: ""Talk about indoctrinating kids. Turning Point has now recruited junior high kids at Pleasant Valley."" Twitter users responded to Richardson’s accusations that Turning Point USA is a hate group and promotes white nationalism.  ""Not to mention it’s a white nationalist extremist group that’s been scrutinized by the Anti Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center for 10 years now,"" one user wrote.  Not to mention it’s a white nationalist extremist group that’s been scrutinized by the Anti Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center for 10 years now. Oh, and they had Kyle Rittenhouse keynote their last rally. Neat! pic.twitter.com/FI9srLwXB4   So, what is Turning Point USA, and what are its politics? And is the accusation that it is a white nationalist group correct? No, said Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow with the Anti-Defamation League Center on Extremism. ""It’s a right-wing Trumpist organization,"" he said in an interview with The Daily Iowan. The Anti-Defamation League does not categorize Turning Point as a hate group, Pitcavage said. ""It does have this checkered or spotted history with regard to individual members or local leaders in Turning Point USA making racist or otherwise problematic comments… but it’s not the ideology of the group itself."" Turning Point USA is a nonprofit founded in 2012 by conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Its mission, according to the organization’s website, is to ""identify, educate, train, and organize students to promote the principles of freedom, free markets, and limited government."" It participates in culture war debate; Kirk’s 2019 ""Culture War"" tour warned that American culture is under attack. PolitiFact has done fact-checks on some statements from the group and Kirk, often finding them false or misleading. Kirk’s public engagements and the organization’s social media pages often follow the heated rhetoric of former President Donald Trump and the far-right, painting Democratic policies as socialism and boosting unsupported claims of fraud in the 2020 election.  
Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, spoke out to the Iowa City community during his ""Culture War"" tour. His tour at The University Iowa took place in the Iowa Memorial Union at 7 p.m. on October 23, 2019. (Mason Childs) Turning Point USA raised $39.8 million and spent $38.4 million in 2019, its 990 federal income tax statement reports. Both are up from $28.6 million in revenue and $25 million in spending in 2018. The organization paid Kirk $283,073 in 2019, the statement shows. The 2019 statement does not list individual donors. The organization has a presence on college campuses, but it also maintains chapters in high schools. The organization says it has more than 1,000 chapters in all 50 states, though it doesn’t differentiate between college and high school chapters. Kirk tours college campuses to speak on conservative politics and rally campus conservatives. The appearances often have been contentious. His 2019 visit to the University of Iowa drew 400 attendees and a handful of people protesting his presence on campus.  The organization also maintains a Professor Watchlist, which documents professors who Turning Point USA says ""discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom."" Parents at Johnston High School have spoken at school board meetings both in favor of and against the organization setting up a chapter at the school. ""This organization is a racist organization,"" one speaker said at a Feb. 7 meeting of the board, according to the left-leaning news outlet Iowa Starting Line. The Iowa Satanic School, not a school but a satirical group protesting school voucher bills, called Turning Point USA a hate group in a reply to the Richardson tweet. Kids who have joined a hate group? Because they clearly don’t have good role models and guidance at home, so someone needs to help them.   Turning Point USA spokesperson Andrew Kolvet denied that the group espouses white nationalism.  ""It’s very unfortunate that so many people on the political left in this country reach for the word racist or white supremacists so easily when it is completely unjustified,"" he said in a Daily Iowan interview. ""It’s damaging to our political discourse. It’s damaging to our country, and it’s damaging to our culture."" Kolvet further said Turning Point USA has ""no ties to white supremacy, and any insinuation otherwise is completely false, fabricated, ill informed, or ignorant."" Joseph Lowndes, a professor of political science at the University of Oregon who studies right-wing movements in the United States, and who appears on the Professor Watchlist, agreed, saying the group’s politics do not align with white nationalism. He contrasted the group with white supremacist organizations like the now-defunct American Identity Movement, formerly Identity Evropa, which was based on ""the preservation of ‘white American culture’ and promoting white European identity,"" according to the Anti-Defamation League.  ""Those are white nationalist organizations because their ideology, what makes them white nationalist, is their dedication to the idea of the superiority of the white race, and I don’t think that’s what Turning Point USA is,"" he said.  Turning Point USA engages in what Lowndes called race-baiting, like Kirk’s ""Critical Racism Tour"" of 2021. In that tour, Kirk called critical race theory — a broad set of ideas about systemic racism developed by legal scholars in the 1990s — racist and argued that it is a pernicious force affecting public schools and universities.  But Lowndes said white nationalism is explicit and the term should not be used loosely. ""White nationalism is shorthand for a bunch of other things,"" he said. ""I think we should be more careful with the term."" Turning Point USA ambassadors and members have sparked their share of controversy in the past, garnering accusations of racism. In most of those cases, those members left or were kicked out of Turning Point shortly after. An article from the Anti-Defamation League catalogs instances of Turning Point members making racist or discriminatory comments, often in private messages and group chats.  For example, In May 2019, video surfaced of Riley Grisar, the president of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas chapter of Turning Point USA saying a racial slur and shouting ""white power."" Turning Point USA removed Grisar from the organization shortly after.  Turning Point USA also been targeted by the ""Groyper army,"" a loose group of white supremacists who attack the organization for not being pro-white and anti-Semitic.  Self-described Groypers have shown up at Kirk’s events in the past, attempting to challenge Kirk on his views. Kirk repeatedly has publicly denounced white supremacists when they’ve shown up at his events.  ""That BS they’re trying to say out there, it’s not who we are, it’s not what we believe, it’s not what Turning Point believes,"" Kirk said at a 2018 speech at Colorado State University, referring to white supremacists protesting outside the building.  Turning Point USA is a right-wing activism group, focused on promoting conservative politics on college and high school campuses and training activists around the country. Founder Charlie Kirk uses issues of race — such as critical race theory — as a rallying point, often drumming up controversy.  But scholars who research white nationalism and even Kirk’s critics say the ideas he advocates for aren’t the tenets of white nationalism. Turning Point USA also has a record of severing ties with white supremacists who are part of the organization. We rate this claim to be False. ",/factchecks/2022/feb/16/tweets/charge-turning-point-usa-white-nationalist-group-f/

Some TV coverage of the 1969 moon landing was animated, but that doesn’t mean the event was fake

The newspaper quoted Robert Stone, director and writer of the PBS show ""Chasing the Moon"" saying that what people initially watched on TV was a re-creation of what was happening in space.  ""They had actors dressed up in spacesuits,"" Stone said. ""They had animation. It wasn’t until they landed and the video camera was pulled out that we saw anything. Before that, it was a radio show with enactments.""

That’s because there wasn’t a camera already waiting on the moon to film the first humans walking there.  A July 2019 post on the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum website explains how the actual footage of the moon landing was recorded. On the advice of the military, according to the post, NASA contracted with Westinghouse to develop a small, $2.29 million black-and-white camera. It was stored for flight in a compartment near the ladder that Armstrong climbed down to reach the moon’s surface. It was activated when he pulled on a handle that released it from the compartment.

U.S. economic growth exceeds rivals’ and has contributed to inflation
 ","Americans are facing conflicting signals on the economy. The economy is growing rapidly, unemployment is low, and wages are rising. But inflation — a broad pattern of rising consumer prices — is at a four-decade high, and for many voters, that fact seems to be crowding out any other economic news. During a Feb. 13 roundtable discussion on ABC’s ""This Week,"" panelists addressed Americans’ concerns about inflation. Patrick Gaspard — who served in President Barack Obama’s administration and is now president and CEO of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank — blamed the coronavirus pandemic for inflation. ""We all know that inflation has been caused by the global economies shutting down all at once, reopening all at once,"" Gaspard said. ""And the fact of the matter is … that the U.S. economy is recovering at a far faster pace than any other country in the OECD. That is an absolute fact."" (The OECD is the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, a group of 38 advanced, industrialized nations.) A look at cross-national data shows that economic growth in the United States has indeed outpaced that of the other large, comparable economies, and experts agree that this rapid growth has been a factor in the United States’ currently high inflation rate.  But rapid economic growth is not the only reason why the U.S. is experiencing high inflation. As evidence for his claim, Gaspard’s office pointed to a report dated Feb. 7 by the OECD. The report found that the United States was the only member of the Group of Seven industrial economies that had seen its inflation-adjusted gross domestic product rise above its pre-pandemic level.  The other six nations in the G-7 — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom — all had yet to reach the GDP levels they had in the fourth quarter of 2019. (Gross domestic product is the sum of all economic activity in a country and is often used as the primary metric for economic growth.) This supports Gaspard’s comment on ""This Week.""  Other calculations further back up his assertion about robust U.S. growth. If you strip the inflation adjustment from GDP growth, to enable a cleaner comparison of GDP to inflation, the United States’ GDP growth ranked fifth among the nations that belong to the Group of 20 (a wider group of large economies than the G-7). In this measurement, the U.S. trailed only Turkey, India, China and South Korea. Notably, the United States’ growth rate exceeded that of each of its fellow G-7 members, whose economies are most similar to that of the U.S. Meanwhile, in a recent paper, Brookings Institution senior fellow Gian Maria Milesi Ferretti found much the same pattern. He compared how countries’ current GDP levels compared with projections made before the pandemic. The United States finished at the top of the heap in his analysis as well. There is also something to Gaspard’s contention that rapid economic growth and inflation are connected. When we looked at the latest annual inflation rates for the G-7 nations, we found that the U.S. had the highest inflation.    However, the correlation between rapid growth and high inflation isn’t perfect. Germany and Canada had the second- and third-highest inflation rates, respectively, but their economic growth barely edged into positive territory when factoring in the pandemic. And the United Kingdom and France nearly matched the U.S.’s GDP growth rates but have experienced more modest inflation. Overall, Gaspard’s focus on rapid GDP growth as a driver of inflation is reasonable, experts said — but they added that the causes of inflation are more complicated. ""The current inflation is not monocausal or easily understood,"" said James Feyrer, a Dartmouth College economist. Ferretti said that ""some global factors affecting inflation are clearly at play, including higher energy prices and disruption of supply chains."" Lower rates of labor force participation in the U.S., stemming heavily from pandemic factors such as a shortage of child care options, also played a role. In fact, one of the factors driving rapid growth in the U.S. — generous fiscal support from the federal government — is something that Biden did have control over. Stimulus payments and other financial support from the federal government put more money into Americans’ hands, driving up demand for goods amid international supply-chain challenges driven by the pandemic. ""Many countries adopted expansionary policies, but on the fiscal side, the U.S. really stands out,"" Ferretti said. ""With very large support to private incomes, U.S. consumption has been very strong, particularly for goods. This has clearly helped the speed of the recovery.""  But a combination of strong demand and labor shortages, he said, has resulted in ""higher inflationary pressures than in other advanced economies."" In other words, where inflation is concerned, Biden isn’t entirely a victim of global forces. His policies were a factor as well. Gaspard said that ""inflation has been caused by the global economies shutting down all at once, reopening all at once. And … the U.S. economy is recovering at a far faster pace than any other country in the OECD."" The U.S. has experienced faster economic growth than most of its most direct global competitors, and experts agree that this has contributed to inflationary pressures.  While many of these inflationary pressures are traceable to global factors related to the pandemic, some have flowed from the fiscal choices made by the Biden administration.  We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2022/feb/16/patrick-gaspard/us-economic-growth-exceeds-rivals-and-has-contribu/

Children are at far higher risk of myocarditis from COVID-19 infection than from vaccines
","Texas cardiologist Dr. Peter McCullough recently claimed that a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study shows COVID-19 vaccines are causing myocarditis in children. But he took the data out of context, making misleading assertions about vaccine safety that ignore the greater health risks COVID-19 infection poses to children. The claims came in a video interview with InfoWars, a website known to publish false stories and conspiracy theories. The video was titled ""Study Proves Children’s Hearts Destroyed By COVID Vaccine."" ""The data were not good at all,"" McCullough said. ""They ended up with 100 serious safety reports, 15% of which had an elevation in troponin. That means there's heart injury occurring in children below age 12. We previously didn't think this was possible. When we looked at myocarditis before COVID-19 vaccination you almost never saw it before puberty."" This interview was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Several of McCullough's claims about COVID-19, including myocarditis in teens and children, have been previously disproven as false or misleading. We reached out to McCullough but did not hear back before publication. Myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, is rare in children. A June 2021 statement signed by multiple professional medical associations and federal health agencies states that myocarditis is an extremely rare side effect after vaccination, and those who do get myocarditis often recover quickly. The FDA expanded emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to children ages 5-11 on Oct. 29, 2021. The CDC study McCullough references is a Dec. 31, 2021, report reviewing data from the agency's two vaccine safety surveillance programs, VAERS and v-safe. The 100 serious safety reports McCullough mentions is out of a total of 4,249 adverse events, meaning 97.6% of those safety reports weren't considered serious. While the 15 cases of elevated troponin levels make up 15% of serious adverse events, they amount to only 0.35% of total adverse events. To put these numbers further into scale, those 4,249 reported adverse events are out of 8.7 million vaccine doses administered over that time period; fewer than one-thousandth of 1% of children who received the vaccine reported elevated troponin, a protein released into the blood during heart damage. Of the 11 children verified to have myocarditis, seven had recovered and the other four were recovering at the time of the report's publication. The systemic reactions that McCullough also remarked on in his interview were all mild to moderately severe, the majority of which were fatigue and headache. These are common side effects of a vaccine, indicating that the immune system is responding and building protection against the virus. Of the approximately 4,500 to 4,600 children who reported having any health impact through the v-safe app, barely 1% required medical care. A far greater risk factor for myocarditis, studies show, is COVID-19 itself. A September 2021 CDC report found that patients of all ages with COVID-19 have a 16 times greater risk of myocarditis compared with patients without COVID-19. And while COVID-19 is usually mild among children, some develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C, where many different parts of the body, including the heart, become inflamed. ""While kids are less likely to develop severe illness from COVID-19, they can get COVID-19, they can transmit COVID-19 and they can die from COVID-19,"" said cardiologist Dr. Matthew Elias in an interview with the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ""Even if they initially have no symptoms with infection, they can still develop MIS-C, which many families haven’t ever heard of."" ""Children are much more likely to develop heart issues after COVID-19 infection than after the vaccine,"" said Elias. ""When children develop myocarditis after COVID-19 infection, it’s typically much more severe than when it occurs post-vaccine."" The American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics both recommend COVID-19 vaccination for children over age five. Children are more likely to avoid heart complications from COVID-19 with vaccination than without.

No, this image doesn’t show pandemic protesters in Australia
","Since late January, truckers have engulfed Canadian cities in protest of the government’s pandemic restrictions and vaccine mandates, snarling traffic and disrupting daily life and multiple trade routes.

Himalayan ‘caterpillar fungus’ is not quite a miracle cancer killer, but it’s promising

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post depicts a fungus that is used in natural medicine to treat cancer and other illnesses, and that researchers are studying for its cancer-killing potential. But its claim about potency against cancer cells incorrectly equates a molecule found in that fungus with a drug derived from the molecule. Although the post doesn’t mention the fungus by name, we ran a Google reverse image search and found that the photo showed a fungus called Ophiocordyceps sinensis, or the caterpillar fungus. Only found 10,000 feet above sea level in the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayas, the fungus acts as a parasite by infecting the larvae of ghost moths and sprouting from the head of the dead insect, according to Insider. Because it’s located in a remote region and is harvested by hand, the fungus is rare, and a single gram of it can cost from $30 to $125, Insider reported. That’s as much as $3,500 an ounce. Demand for the fungus has risen over the years, as it’s used often in traditional Asian medicine for its supposed immunity boosting power. The fungus has been used to treat a variety of maladies, including cancer, according to The Atlantic.  It’s also used often as an aphrodisiac, and has been called the ""Himalayan Viagra.""   The post claims a molecule in the fungus can kill cancer cells with ""40 times the potency."" It doesn’t provide much context for the potency claim or explain what it’s comparing the molecule to. There is a basis for that number, but the post describes it incorrectly. Researchers at the University of Oxford announced in October that they were working with the United Kingdom drug company NuCana to develop a chemotherapy drug derived from the fungus. Researchers found the fungus contained a natural nucleoside analogue, a type of antiviral compound used in therapeutic drugs, which has cancer-killing properties. But the compound breaks down in the blood quickly, and only a small amount of it is ever delivered to a tumor, researchers said. NuCana was able to design a drug derived from the compound that researchers said was longer-lasting and had a ""40 times greater potency for killing cancer cells"" than what’s found naturally in the fungus, the University of Oxford reported. Testing of the drug’s cancer-killing power has primarily been in a laboratory setting, but preliminary results from Phase I clinical trials have shown ""encouraging signals of anti-cancer activity"" in people who have received it, according to an article published by the researchers. Phase II trials are underway and involve testing the drug's possible impact on solid tumors and lymphoma. The trial is expected to be completed by July. Despite its use in traditional medicine as a cancer treatment and the research into its antiviral properties, the National Cancer Institute said the fungus is currently ""not an approved treatment for any type of cancer."" Since the drug is still in the early clinical trial phase, and its potency was only measured in a laboratory setting, it's still far away from being a breakthrough in cancer treatment as suggested in the Facebook post.  A Facebook post claims a molecule found in a Himalayan fungus can kill cancer with ""40 times the potency."" The fungus, known as Ophiocordyceps sinensis, has been used in traditional Asian medicine to treat a variety of illnesses including cancer.  Researchers in the United Kingdom have found that the fungus contains an antiviral compound that has anti-cancer effects. They were able to derive a chemotherapy drug from the compound, and laboratory tests showed it was 40 times more potent in destroying cancer cells than what’s found naturally in the fungus.  It is the drug that’s derived from the compound in the fungus — not the compound in the fungus itself — that has the potent cancer-killing power.

""Our officers were very calm, clear and concise that the building was closed and that these individuals that were refusing to leave had to leave,"" NYPD Lt. Conor McDonald told USA Today. ""They had the opportunity to leave and didn't take it."" The group refused to leave and were arrested and issued trespassing summonses. One of the people who was arrested had two prior arrests for similar trespassing violations, the New York Post reported. The child was escorted to the police station in a separate car from those who were arrested. While the adults were served their summonses, the child was given cookies and a drink and was cared for by two female officers, news outlets reported. ""Any suggestion that the girl was detained or had enforcement action taken against her couldn’t be further from the truth,"" a police spokesperson told the Associated Press. ""The officers had an obligation to care for her, which they did until the mother qualified for her summons for trespassing."" An Instagram post said the New York City Police Department arrested a 9-year-old ""because she didn’t have a vaccine card in the museum."" The child was not arrested. She was escorted to the police station and cared for by officers until a group of adults who had been arrested — including her mother — was released. The adults were arrested for trespassing because they refused to leave the museum after it closed, not because they failed to show proof of vaccination. We rate this claim False.

Pfizer’s data on COVID-19 vaccine for children under 5 is based in science
","U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, a Republican from Texas who is running for reelection in Texas' 21st Congressional District, was not pleased to see news that Pfizer is requesting the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to authorize its COVID-19 vaccine for children under the age of 5. In a Feb. 1 Tweet, Roy wrote, ""Literally using the force of government and the culture of fear to jab children under 5 — with zero basis in science — to make billions of dollars. Shameful, @pfizer."" Roy linked to a Jan. 31 New York Times article reporting this move ahead of Pfizer and BioNTech's expected request. Pfizer is seeking authorization for a two-dose regimen while evaluating how well three doses work. Does Pfizer's effort to seek authorization for its vaccine for the youngest children have ""zero basis in science""? We took a look at that part of the claim. A spokesperson from Roy's office wrote in a Feb. 3 email: ""Rep. Roy’s tweet was intended to bring attention to the fact that, not only there is not a pressing need to vaccinate children — who are extremely low risk for hospitalization and death from COVID-19 — but, according to CNN, Pfizer’s initial trials on a two-dose regimen for children under 5 did not provide sufficient immunity, causing them to begin a new trial adding a third dose."" The Dec. 17 CNN article cited is about adding a third dose to trials after the vaccine for children ages 2 to 5 did not provide expected immunity. So, Roy is concerned with authorizing emergency use when the data for the third dose is still being collected. The spokesperson also wrote that there is a low demographic risk level when you compare Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 mortality statistics between age groups. The spokesperson highlighted ""an extreme disparity between children and the elderly"" because there were 393 deaths for children under age 5 and more than 166,000 deaths for those ages 65 to 74 as of Feb. 2. A Dec. 17 press statement — same day as that CNN article — from Pfizer indicated the company was evaluating a third 10-microgram dose for children ages 5 to 12 after an effective three-dose regimen for people ages 16 and older. Pfizer described its trial for children ages 6 months to 4 years in its Feb. 1 news release about requesting authorization. The trial initially enrolled 4,500 children ages 6 months to under 12 years old in the U.S., Finland, Poland, and Spain at more than 90 clinical trial sites. Children under age 5 received a lower dose compared to children ages 5 to 12. The trial grew to 8,300 children as of Feb. 1 following the study's amendments, according to that release. The trials evaluate vaccine safety and effectiveness. That Feb. 1 Pfizer press release indicated the two-dose regimen did not produce the expected immune response for children ages 2 to 5 but did for children up to age 2. In a Feb. 4 email, Pfizer spokesperson Sharon J. Castillo wrote that Pfizer and BioNTech’s application is for authorization of the first two three-microgram doses of a planned three-dose series for children up to age 4. ""Data on a third dose, given at least 8 weeks after completion of the second dose, are expected in the coming months and will be submitted to the FDA to support a potential expansion of this requested EUA,"" Castillo wrote. In clinical trials, researchers track side effects, immune response and antibody levels compared to adults and teens. The journey to a vaccine is often a long process. Dr. Joseph Cantey at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio said that the steps that vaccines go through to be safe and effective is very rigorous. Companies did not take shortcuts on that process even with the urgency of the pandemic. ""What we have seen is a streamlining of all the steps that have to happen so those steps can happen without long delays in between them. So, in non-pandemic settings, a drug company might have an idea for a new vaccine or new mechanism, and they would do what we call pre-clinical trials,"" he said. Then there would be a gap in years between pre-clinical trials and clinical trials, Cantey explained, as a vaccine developer secured funding or went through the regulatory hoops. Then they would start studies while the drug company might work on other products or different priorities. ""The main thing that happened with the COVID vaccine is not that the Phase 1 or Phase 2 or Phase 3 studies were any shorter or less rigorous,"" Cantey said. ""It was all that downtime in between got eliminated, because there's such an urgency for these vaccines that companies went through Phase 1 to Phase 2 to Phase 3 in a matter of months instead of a manner of years or a decade."" For the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA enter the muscle cells and instruct the cells to produce a harmless spike protein — the same that is found on the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the CDC. The body's immune response to this spike protein teaches the body how to fight the virus. Cantey said it is a matter of calibrating the dosage and ensuring there are no unanticipated side effects. ""Children are definitely not just little adults. You can't say 'well this adult weighs 200 pounds and needs X dose and this child weighs 20 pounds so they need X dose divided by 10.' That's not exactly how it works,"" Cantey said. ""Finding the right dose so that those kids' immune systems can respond to the vaccine in a positive way is a little bit different. But the mechanism itself—the ability of the vaccine to deliver that messenger RNA to cells so that they can make spike proteins, so that the child's immune system can recognize it and protect them from coronavirus—that's the same."" Castillo, the Pfizer spokeswoman, noted Pfizer believes a three-dose series would provide important protection against omicron and future variants. Castillo also noted that series of three doses or more are not uncommon in pediatric vaccines. The American Academy of Pediatrics said in a Feb. 1 press statement that it is encouraged by the prospect that a vaccine will be available for children under age 5, ""pending a rigorous review of Pfizer-BioNTech's scientific data validating its safety and effectiveness by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."" When the Food and Drug Administration authorized the emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children ages 5 to 11, the agency had ensured that the authorization was after a ""thorough and transparent evaluation of the data"" that included expertise of people independent of the FDA committee, according to an Oct. 29 news release. The vaccine's safety was studied in 3,100 children of that age range. The vaccine's immune effectiveness had been measured, and no serious side effects had been detected in that study.  Children are less likely to have severe symptoms compared to older people, and most COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. have occurred among people age 65 or older, as Rep. Roy's office said.  Dr. Donald Murphey, member of the Texas Medical Association's COVID-19 Task Force and chair of the Texas Medical Association's Council on Science and Public Health, said he often is asked if children need to get immunized or if children get COVID-19. ""The answer is yes. There's even some recent studies with omicron coming that kids get about the same number of COVID infections that adults do,"" Murphey said. ""They don't get as sick with them, but they do get the same number of infections. If you look for kids who have an asymptomatic infection, they get just as much COVID as adults. And they also spread COVID just as much as adults do."" However, an Oct. 26 FDA advisory committee briefing document about consideration of the vaccine for children ages 5 to 11 noted, ""Although the mortality rate for COVID-19 in children is substantially lower than that in adults, COVID-19 was among the top 10 leading causes of death for children 5 to 14 years of age between January and May 2021 in the US."" The emergence of the omicron variant is the reason why the FDA is prioritizing a vaccine for children under age 5, according to the FDA's Feb. 1 news release. Both the FDA and Pfizer's Feb. 1 press releases acknowledge that the FDA had asked Pfizer and BioNTech to submit its data because of the variant. In a Jan. 28 news release regarding in-school learning, the American Academy of Pediatrics noted more than 2 million children were infected with COVID-19 in January. Pfizer highlighted in its Feb. 1 statement that hospitalization among children has spiked due to the omicron variant surge. Parents reserve the right to decide whether their child gets vaccinated. PolitiFact has fact-checked claims, in November and August, on parents or school-aged children being forced to receive the vaccine. Roy tweeted regarding consideration of authorizing the vaccine for children age 5 and younger: ""Literally using the force of government and the culture of fear to jab children under 5 - with zero basis in science - to make billions of dollars. Shameful, @pfizer."" However, the development of the vaccine and subsequent clinical trials, as well as the decision on whether to authorize the vaccine, are based in science. Pfizer's clinical trial being administered to thousands of children worldwide including in the U.S. is designed to verify the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. The FDA's decision to authorize emergency use of the vaccine for children under age 5 would be based on the review of the scientific data available. This would likely include both an evaluation of effectiveness and safety, as the data review for children ages 5 to 11 had entailed in October. So the effectiveness of the two-dose course for children under age 5 would be scrutinized in the decision-making process. The urgency for a vaccine for young children stems from the effect of the omicron variant and its transmissibility. Children could fall sick and/or pass on the virus to others around them. Even with this urgency, the FDA's decision would be rooted in a scientific review. We rate this claim as Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2022/feb/15/chip-roy/research-submitted-fda-consideration-vaccine-autho/

No, the CDC wasn’t ‘normalizing’ blood clots with its Super Bowl tweet
","A few days before Super Bowl LVI , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention referenced the game in a tweet about how to safeguard against the common risk of blood clots. That prompted several vaccine skeptics on social media to respond that it was an effort by the agency at ""normalizing blood clots."" ""Normalizing blood clots,"" read a Feb. 12 Facebook post that shared a screenshot of the CDC tweet from two days prior. ""Maybe, if you avoid a certain strongly pushed jab you won’t have to worry so much about this. & if you get CO\/ID you can take aspirin or NAC. Have they EVER before put out anything like this for the SuperBowl? The answer would be NO."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The pre-Super Bowl tweet, however, was not the first time the CDC took to Twitter to warn about the dangers of blood clots. We found instances of such tweets published in February and March of 2015, years before there was a COVID-19, as well as twice in October of 2020, before there was an authorized COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S.  Neither was it the first time the CDC tied such a warning to a big sporting event. In 2016, it also warned its Twitter followers during March Madness about the dangers of blood clots.  The CDC did not return a request for comment for this article. The best defense is a good offense! Defend yourself against #bloodclots w/ these tips. #MarchMadness pic.twitter.com/6F8UO9aYWY Blood clots are normal and are the body’s way of stopping bleeding after an injury. Those clots normally dissolve on their own and are harmless. But venous thromboembolism, which refers to clots that form in the veins, can be deadly. VTE consists of deep vein thrombosis (clots that usually begin in the legs but sometimes in the arm or pelvis) and pulmonary embolism (when a deep-vein clot dislodges and travels to the lungs). The CDC says these types of blood clots affect about 900,000 people yearly in the U.S. and that about 100,000 people die from them. It’s the leading cause of death in people with cancer, aside from the cancer itself. It also is a leading cause of death in pregnant women or those who have just given birth. Blood clots can happen to anyone, even athletes, but there are risk factors, including injuries, surgery, chronic illnesses, obesity and extended periods of limited movement, such as during long flights. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were first authorized for emergency use in December 2020 and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was given emergency authorization in February 2021.  There have been some reports of people developing blood clots after COVID-19 vaccination, but they are very rare. According to the CDC and the FDA, there have been 57 confirmed reports of people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and later developed a rare clotting disorder called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). That’s out of more than 18 million doses given in the U.S., as of Feb. 3.  There have been nine deaths related to TTS among Johnson & Johnson vaccine recipients, according to the CDC. It recommends the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines instead, although it said the Johnson & Johnson vaccine can still be offered. There have been three confirmed cases of TTS among Moderna vaccine recipients out of more than 522 million doses, according to the CDC, which said that there is not an increased risk of TTS from the vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University has also been tied to a rare blood clot disorder. Scientists believe they have figured out the cause: its use of another harmless virus that can leak into the bloodstream and bind to a protein that is involved in the natural clotting process, The New York Times reported. The AstraZeneca vaccine has not been authorized for use in the U.S. Health experts say that patients who are infected with COVID-19 commonly develop blood clots due to the virus. The virus ""is very well known to cause blood clots, so your odds of getting COVID-induced blood clots if you catch COVID are higher than the vaccine induced blood clots,"" Dr. Shruti Gohil, associate medical director for epidemiology and infection prevention and assistant professor of infectious diseases, at the University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, told PolitiFact in October. The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes high levels of inflammation, which could trigger clotting often seen in COVID-19 patients, according to the National Heart Blood and Lung Institute. A Facebook post expressing skepticism about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines claimed the CDC was ""normalizing blood clots""  by tweeting about it before the Super Bowl. Blood clots are common and can kill up to 100,000 Americans a year. The CDC has previously tweeted about the dangers of blood clots, including during the 2016 NCAA college basketball tournament. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been linked to rare cases of TTS, and the CDC said people should get the Pfizer and Moderna instead. Another vaccine from AstraZeneca, which has not been authorized for use in the U.S., has been linked to a separate, rare clotting disorder. Meanwhile, people are at risk of developing blood clots from the COVID-19 infection itself, which causes inflammation in the body.  The post is wrong to suggest that the CDC’s warning about blood clots is a new thing and that it’s somehow tied to COVID-19 vaccines.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2022/feb/15/facebook-posts/no-cdc-wasnt-normalizing-blood-clots-its-super-bow/

Has Gov. Evers granted more pardons than any Wisconsin governor in recent history?
","During his eight years in office, former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, did not issue a single pardon. In contrast, his successor – Democrat Tony Evers – touts every one he grants. ""Last week, I granted another 54 pardons, bringing our total to 391 — more than any Wisconsin governor in contemporary history,"" Evers said in a Jan 13, 2022, news release.  On Feb. 7, 2022, he issued another release, setting the number at 416. Pardons, of course, can restore certain civil rights and privileges and relieve some legal issues. They differ from clemency or sentence commutations, which would allow a person to leave prison early. Pardons under Evers have included low-level drug dealers, long-ago drunk driving cases, mistakes made as youth and more. Among other things, a pardon can make it easier for people to get jobs.  Is Evers right that the number is the most in ""contemporary history""? The key word in Evers’ claim, of course, is ""contemporary.""  Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback said in a Feb. 1, 2022, email that the governor’s office looked at the past 40 years. They also said they considered Evers contemporaries to be any previous governors still living today.  In that timeframe, only Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, came close to granting the same number of pardons — 326, according to the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau. But he did it over eight years in office. Here is a look at how various governors compare: Looking beyond that 40-year period, Gov. Patrick Lucey, a Democrat who served from 1971 to 1977, issued at least 392 pardons.  We say ""at least 392"" because tracking pardons requires reviewing Senate and Assembly journals or records held with the Wisconsin Secretary of State. And the exact figure for each governor may vary depending on who collected the information and how it was done. For instance, numbers of pardons issued per governor provided by Evers differed from those provided by the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau. The governor’s office said Lucey issued 457 pardons through his six years in office. The bureau says the number was 392.  For our figures, we are relying on the reference bureau, which compiles information on pardons, commutations and reprieves through the past couple years. The bureau has an ongoing effort to tabulate historical information on the use of executive clemency throughout all Wisconsin history.  To find a governor who issued more pardons than Evers or Lucey, you would have to go back to Gov. Julius Heil, a Republican, who served from 1939 to 1943.  At the time, Wisconsin governors served two-year terms. In his first term, Heil granted 486 pardons and another 448 in his second term, for a total of 934, according to the Legislative Reference Bureau. Evers said he’s issued the most pardons in Wisconsin ""contemporary history."" As of Feb. 7, 2022, Evers had issued 416 pardons. In the last 40 years, only Doyle came close to granting the same number of pardons — 326. To find a governor who issued more, you’d have to go back to Julius Heil, whose term ended 79 years ago. We rate his claim True.  ",/factchecks/2022/feb/15/tony-evers/heres-how-gov-tony-evers-blistering-pace-pardons-s/

Fact-checking Louisiana Democrat’s claim about Black Americans and the right to vote
","Gary Chambers, a Louisiana Democrat running for the U.S. Senate, sets fire to a Confederate flag in a campaign video as he cites statistics about racial injustice and says ""it’s time to burn what remains of the Confederacy down."" ""Here in Louisiana and all over the South, Jim Crow never really left, and the remnants of the Confederacy remain,"" Chambers says. ""The attacks against Black people, our right to vote and participate in this democracy are methodological.""  Chambers reels off a few statistics including this one: ""1 in 13 Black Americans are deprived of the right to vote."" Chambers didn’t cite evidence in his video or explain what he meant, but his other campaign materials made it clear he was referring to the number of Black Americans who have lost that right due to a felony conviction. A Chambers press release cited a statistic from 2016, but as of 2020 slightly fewer Black Americans were blocked from voting. The majority of those who can’t vote due to a felony conviction are no longer in prison. Chambers, a social justice advocate from Baton Rouge, is running in a Democratic primary with hopes of ousting U.S. Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican. Before the passage of the 15th Amendment, which guaranteed men the right to vote regardless of race, very few states barred prisoners from voting, a lawyer at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University previously told PolitiFact. But after the post-Civil War amendment passed, a wave of states enacted laws or amendments to take away prisoners’ right to vote.  President Joe Biden campaigned on a promise to incentivize states to restore felon voting rights. His efforts so far have stalled amid Republican opposition in the Senate to set uniform voting rights laws, including for felons once they leave prison. That means states have the power to set their own voting laws. During the past decade, the trend has turned toward making it easier for felons to regain their right to vote after leaving prison. Proponents argue that after felons pay their debt to society, they should be allowed to positively contribute to society by voting. Opponents say that those who break the law should not easily earn back the right to vote.  A press release from the Chambers campaign showed that he pulled the statistic from a 2020  Brookings Institution report. That document linked to a 2016 report by the Sentencing Project, a group that supports expanding voting rights. It was based on data collected by sociologists with the University of Minnesota and the University of Georgia.  In 2016, the Sentencing Project found that one in 13 African Americans of voting age was disenfranchised, a rate more than four times greater than that of non-African Americans. In 2020, the figure fell to 1 in 16 Black Americans. It includes people who have served their sentence, are on probation or parole, or remain in prison. The numbers of disenfranchised felons fell between 2016 and 2020 as more states made it easier for some felons to regain the right to vote including California, Iowa, New York, New Jersey, Nevada, Colorado, Wyoming and Washington, D.C. There is variation among states on how many felons — of all races and ethnicities — are disenfranchised, because each Legislature or governor sets its own rules. In sheer numbers, Florida has the highest number of disenfranchised felons. In 2018, Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment that restored voting rights to people with past felony convictions, but subsequent legislation required that they fulfill other conditions of their sentence first, such as paying restitution and court costs.  In Maine, Vermont and now Washington, D.C., felons don’t lose their right to vote, according to a 2021 analysis by the National Conference of State Legislatures.  In 21 states, felons lose their voting rights only while incarcerated, and regain their right to vote upon release. In the remainder of the states, felons also lose their voting rights while on parole and/or probation or have to meet other conditions to regain their right to vote.  Chambers said in a campaign video ""one in 13 Black Americans are deprived of the right to vote.""  Chambers’ video didn’t explain why they are deprived of the right to vote. But he was referring to the number of African Americans who lost the right to vote due to a felony conviction, based on a 2016 analysis from the Sentencing Project. A  2020 report by the same group found that number dropped slightly to 1 in 16 African Americans. It includes people who have served their sentence, are on probation or parole, or remain in prison. Chambers’ overall point that a significant number of Black people are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction is correct, but in an environment where issues of voter suppression are widely discussed and debated, the figure benefits from more explanation.

Books listed in viral tweet aren't banned statewide in Texas
","Scrutiny of books in schools intensified in Texas last year, as state Rep. Matt Krause, R-Fort Worth, chairman of the House Committee on General Investigating, requested that superintendents catalog nearly 850 titles related to race and sex or that could produce ""discomfort"" among students. Separately, some school boards in Texas have moved to remove books from libraries, as books have been challenged and banned in other states as well. A viral Feb. 1 tweet that garnered at least 16,100 retweets and 65,800 likes by Australian user @AnthCondon said, ""Books banned in Texas include 1984, Maus, and The Handmaid's Tale, but not Mein Kampf. I'm done arguing with people over whether this is fascism."" PolitiFact Texas reached out to the user for his source but did not hear back. The books the user refers to are: Is this post right about these books being banned in Texas and ""Mein Kampf"" not banned? Let's take a look. A ban is the removal of a book from a collective space, whereas a challenge brings the book into question based on the objections of a person or group, according to the American Library Association. The American Library Association noted online, ""Due to the commitment of librarians, teachers, parents, students and other concerned citizens, most challenges are unsuccessful and most materials are retained in the school curriculum or library collection."" Rob Weiner, a popular culture librarian at Texas Tech University, said there is a long history in the U.S. of challenging and banning books. ""Certainly, there is a political impetus behind it. But it's nothing new. That's why there's Banned Books Week,"" Weiner said. The tweet does not specify whether it is referring to Krause's letter to superintendents but the books named in the letter have not been removed from libraries statewide. The letter also doesn't include the titles mentioned in the tweet, though it does include 'The Handmaid's Tale: The Graphic Novel' by Margaret Atwood and Renee Nault. Because of heightened scrutiny around what is being taught in schools and Krause's list, there is a wave of local attempts to remove specific books from school and public libraries. ""Many of these challenges began with the titles on Rep. Krause’s list, including 'The Handmaid's Tale: The Graphic Novel' by Margaret Atwood and Renee Nault,"" said Shirley Robinson, executive director of the Texas Library Association, in a Feb. 8 email to PolitiFact Texas. ""However, from there, the issue has continued to snowball on a case-by-case basis with individuals taking it upon themselves to carefully and subjectively curate a selection of books to challenge based on specific themes and genres."" She noted Texas public schools have clear, transparent processes approved by school boards for addressing book challenges. Usually that means a committee of educators and parents is appointed to read the book and evaluate its educational value. The process is similar in public libraries with selections made based on guidelines approved by the library's governing authority. Proponents for book banning are painting this issue ""with a broad brush"" for political support while taking the decision-making process away from children and parents, Robinson said. When Gov. Greg Abbott showed support for Krause's scrutiny of school books, he said parents ""are rightfully outraged about highly inappropriate books and other content in public school libraries."" A vast majority of the books named in the state letter are about or reference sexuality, LGBTQ+ identity, and race. An October analysis by The Dallas Morning News found that 97 of the first 100 titles listed were written by women, people of color, or LGBTQ+ authors. Records requested by NBC News of nearly 100 Texas school districts found 86 formal requests to remove books from libraries in 2021, with the majority of requests coming at the end of the year after Krause sent his letter. A librarian who is a member of #FReadom, a collective of librarians who highlight the work of libraries and books in reaction to Krause's letter, said they weren't aware of any of the books mentioned in the tweet being recently challenged in Texas, other than ""The Handmaid's Tale: The Graphic Novel."" The librarian also noted a district in another state removed the title ""Maus"" from its curriculum, not library. That state was Tennessee, where a school board banned ""Maus"" in January, as reported by the (Nashville) Tennessean. ""Some high school libraries own Mein Kampf in Texas,"" the #FReadom librarian wrote. ""We checked four — two owned it, one did not, and one did not, but had a video about it. So we would say it's true that high school libraries 'sometimes' have Mein Kampf."" Robinson wrote that it is possible titles mentioned in the tweet may have been discussed on the local level. ""Each school district has its own process for challenges to books because each school district is different, and there isn’t a one-size-fits-all strategy that would work across a state the size of Texas,"" Robinson said. ""As there is no central organization in Texas tracking every book that is challenged, it is almost impossible to say whether one particular title has been banned in Texas public schools or libraries in the past."" ""The Handmaid's Tale"" and ""1984"" are both on the American Library Association's Top 100 Most Banned and Challenged Books: 2010-2019 online list. ""The Handmaid's Tale"" was the seventh most challenged and banned book in 2019 nationally for ""vulgarity and sexual overtones."" A viral Feb. 1 tweet said, ""Books banned in Texas include 1984, Maus, and The Handmaid's Tale, but not Mein Kampf. I'm done arguing with the people over whether this is fascism."" While Texas is seeing an influx in local requests to remove books, there is no statewide ban in place. Additionally, ""1984,"" ""Maus"" and ""The Handmaid's Tale"" are not named in a state effort to scrutinize certain books, though ""The Handmaid's Tale: The Graphic Novel"" by Margaret Atwood and Renee Nault is included on the list.
