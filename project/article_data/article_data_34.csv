Rhode Island state Rep. Lisa Tomasso says that exports from the Ocean State have increased by 53 percent over the last two years.
","
The Rhode Island economy is stagnating. While other parts of the country are starting to recover from the recession, the Ocean State is stuck in place, with little job growth and an unemployment rate far above the national average.

But one part of the local economy has actually shown significant improvement in recent years, according to state Rep. Lisa P. Tomasso.

""Rhode Island’s exports have increased by 53 percent in the last two years,"" the Coventry Democrat said in a State House news release on April 5. ""This is something we need to pay attention to. Exports are essential to economic growth, not only in the nation but here at home in Rhode Island.""

Fifty-three percent. That’s quite an increase, a surprising one considering the well-known ills of the state economy. So naturally we wondered whether it’s really true.

""When I heard it, my reaction was the same,"" Tomasso said when we asked her about the increase.

She told us that she heard the figure at a recent meeting of the General Assembly’s Joint Committee on Economic Development in Rhode Island, of which she is a member. The information on exports was part of a presentation put together by the John H. Chafee Center for International Business at Bryant University.

While we waited for her to get us a copy of that PowerPoint presentation, we started our own research on the issue.

Information on Rhode Island’s exports, it turns out, is easy to find on the web. The International Trade Administration, an arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce, tracks all sorts of data on exports nationally and by state. We used a tool on the ITA’s website to create tables on Rhode Island’s exports for the past seven years.

Rhode Island has exported products to 184 countries since 2009. The state’s leading foreign market is Canada, which accounts for more than a quarter of the state’s exports in terms of dollar value. Germany and Mexico are second and third, respectively.

The state’s top exports are waste and scrap -- which account for 30.2 percent of total exports -- followed by manufactured metals (13.5 percent), chemicals (11.1 percent), miscellaneous manufactured products, including jewelry, medical equipment, sporting goods and office supplies (9.4 percent), machinery (7.3 percent) and electronic equipment (6.5 percent).

The total value of the state’s exports has nearly doubled since 2005, but what about in the last two years alone? In 2009, exports totaled $1.5 billion. In 2011, they were $2.3 billion, which is in fact a 53-percent increase.

With that question answered, we were curious about the reasons for the steep increase.

One reason has to do with the global recession. Exports around the world fell at the nadir of the economic downturn. It was no different in Rhode Island, where in 2009 exports plummeted by 24 percent compared with the previous year -- from nearly $2 billion to $1.5 billion. The state made up that ground by 2010 and the number increased again in 2011. Because the state’s exports had fallen so far, the recent gains were more dramatic than in typical years.

Another reason for the high percentage has a similar logic. Rhode Island’s exports, at $2.3 billion in value, are low compared with other states, such as Connecticut, where exports totaled $16.2 billion last year, or Massachusetts, with $27.7 billion in exports. So in Rhode Island, a large increase in volume can have an outsize effect in terms of percentage.

Meanwhile, Tomasso sent us the presentation put together by the Chafee Center at Bryant, which advises businesses on how to export their products overseas. Not surprisingly, the 53-percent figure in the presentation was based on the same numbers that we found on the ITA website.

We called Ray Fogarty, the director of the Chafee Center who also serves as the Rhode Island state trade director. He agreed that the recent increase in exports was more noticeable because the state had fallen so far.

In addition, on a national level, many manufacturers are moving their operations back to the United States from overseas as labor and other costs come down. Those companies are then exporting their products, said Fogarty. So that has helped drive the increase in Rhode Island and many other states.

We also asked Fogarty why our top export products are waste and scrap. He said the Port of Providence has become a regional shipping hub for scrap metal, with supplies coming in from Massachusetts and Connecticut and other nearby states and then sent to Canada, Turkey, China and other countries.

Our ruling

Tomasso said that exports from Rhode Island have increased by 53 percent over the past two years. According to federal trade statistics, she’s correct.

That improvement doesn’t mean the state’s economy is set to turn around anytime soon, but it may be a sign of hope.

We rate Tomasso’s claim True.

NRA's Wayne LaPierre cites frequency of violent crime in discussion of Trayvon Martin case
","
When the National Rifle Association held its annual meeting in St. Louis on April 14, 2012, it came amid an often heated public debate sparked by the killing of Trayvon Martin, a Sanford, Fla., teen who was shot to death by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, who said it was in self defense.

The Martin case provoked strong public disagreement about the wisdom of ""stand-your-ground"" laws, which had been aggressively pushed in many states by the NRA.

Wayne LaPierre, the gun-rights group’s CEO, took up the controversy head-on during his speech at his group’s national meeting. According to a New York Times account, LaPierre sought to put the Martin killing in context by noting that ""violent crimes happen all the time in cities across the United States.""

Specifically, LaPierre said, ""By the time I finish this speech, two Americans will be slain, six women will be raped, 27 of us will be robbed, and 50 more will be beaten. That’s the harsh reality we face, all of us, every single day. But the media, they don’t care. Everyday victims aren’t celebrities. They don’t draw ratings, don’t draw sponsors. But sensational reporting from Florida does.""

We won’t judge LaPierre’s conclusions about what the statistics mean, but we did think it would be worth checking whether the statistics are accurate.

We began by figuring out how long LaPierre’s speech is. The YouTube video uploaded by the NRA runs about 33 minutes. That means that you could fit 43 such speeches into one day and 15,695 speeches into a year.

To find the actual numbers, we first turned to the FBI’s uniform crime reports -- a detailed national accounting of crime statistics. Here are the overall numbers for 2010 for the closest categories to the ones LaPierre cited:

• Murder and non-negligent manslaughter: 14,748
• Forcible rape: 84,767
• Robbery: 367,832
• Aggravated assault: 778,901

Then we calculated how many of these crimes would occur in a 33-minute period:

• Killings: 0.94 killings every 33 minutes
• Rapes: 5.4 rapes every 33 minutes
• Robberies: 23.4 robberies every 33 minutes
• Beatings: 49.6 beatings every 33 minutes

Let’s first dispense with the most straightforward statistic: aggravated assaults, or what LaPierre called ""beatings."" LaPierre’s number is very close -- only off by about 1 percent.

Meanwhile, using the FBI statistics, the figure for rape is also reasonably close -- LaPierre is high by about 10 percent. LaPierre’s figures for robbery are off by a larger margin -- they’re about 15 percent too high.

So, LaPierre’s a little high on each of these claims, but by a modest margin. The one statistic where he’s far off-base concerns killings.

His use of the word ""slain"" offers some room for interpretation. The closest FBI category is ""murder and nonnegligent manslaughter."" Using this number (14,748) LaPierre’s number is more than twice the actual rate of Americans who are ""slain.""

A different data set -- the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s annual tabulation of how Americans die -- counts ""homicides"" instead and found 16,065 in 2010, or 1.02 every 33 minutes. That’s a bit higher than the FBI numbers, but it still means that LaPierre’s estimate of killings was roughly twice as high as they actually are.

We wondered whether LaPierre was counting suicides along with homicides. (The NRA did not return our request for further information.) But if he did, he would have been far off with that method as well. According to CDC, the combination of homicides and suicides was 53,858 in 2010, or 3.43 every 33 minutes, which would have made his estimate well short of the actual number.

Our ruling

Overall, LaPierre’s estimate was fairly accurate. He was very close with assaults, and off by just 10 percent for rape and 16 percent for robbery. But he offered a rate of killing that was twice as high as the actual rate. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True. 
UPDATE: After our story came out, the National Rifle Association got back to us. A spokesman explained that the claim ""two Americans will be slain"" during the speech had been calculated by adding the FBI figure for murder and non-negligent manslaughter (14,748) to the number killed in alcohol-impaired-driving crashes in 2010 as reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (10,228). Rounded up, that equals two deaths during the period of the speech. However, we aren’t convinced by the methodology. The NHTSA data for 2010 includes 3,601 people who were passengers in the drunk driver’s car, occupants of other cars on the road, or bystanders. That’s only about one-third of the total fatalities. The majority of deaths in such crashes -- 6,627 -- are of the alcohol-impaired driver. We don’t think deaths of alcohol-impaired drivers fit the definition of ""slain,"" unless you also include suicides more generally, which as we noted above would make LaPierre’s estimate significantly lower than the actual number. On balance, we are sticking with our ruling of Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/apr/16/wayne-lapierre/nras-wayne-lapierre-cites-frequency-violent-crime-/

Tom Leppert says Ted Cruz has not led businesses
","
Businessman and former Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert says fellow candidate Ted Cruz, a Houston lawyer, has a meaningful gap in his background.

During the April 13, 2012, Republican U.S. Senate debate at WFAA-TV in Dallas, Cruz asked Leppert to comment on another candidate’s position on wage taxes. Leppert didn’t go there, instead replying: ""The reality of it is that you have been a terrific staffer in the attorney general’s office. But the reality of it is you haven’t led businesses. So when you start talking about these issues, on how they impact business, to you it’s really an academic exercise. To me, it’s a career.""

Has Cruz never led a business?

In a telephone interview, Leppert spokesman Daniel Keylin told us that Leppert based his claim on Cruz’s biography as presented on Cruz’s campaign website.

Cruz says in the site’s biographical section that he is now a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP in Houston, where he ""leads the firm’s U.S. Supreme Court and national appellate litigation practice."" From 2003 to 2008, the section says, Cruz was the state’s solicitor general, leading state government’s legal appeals before state and federal courts, including the Supreme Court. (Cruz was appointed to the post by Attorney General Greg Abbott, the state’s chief lawyer.)

From 2004 to 2009,  the entry says, Cruz also taught U.S. Supreme Court litigation as an adjunct professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law. And before that, the entry indicates, he held back-to-back federal posts and helped George W. Bush run for president.

""Prior to serving as solicitor general, Ted served as the director of the Office of Policy Planning at the Federal Trade Commission,"" Cruz’s entry says. He earlier was ""an associate deputy attorney general at the U.S. Department of Justice,"" according to the entry, after serving as ""domestic policy advisor on the 2000 Bush-Cheney campaign.

""In addition, Ted clerked for Chief Justice William Rehnquist on the U.S. Supreme Court,"" the entry says.

We asked Cruz’s campaign if Leppert’s claim about his not leading any businesses holds up. Spokesman James Bernsen pointed to Cruz’s campaign biography.

"['National', 'Guns', 'Joe Biden']","
Biden says most shootings happen with victim’s own gun
","
In an interview on CBS’ Face the Nation, Vice President Joe Biden was asked about the Trayvon Martin killing in Sanford, Fla.

""Do you, on balance, think these laws are good laws?"" host Bob Schieffer asked in the April 1, 2012, program, referring to Florida’s ""stand your ground"" self-defense law and others around the country.

Biden said he thinks it’s important to protect Second Amendment rights but expressed skepticism of laws that could result in people putting themselves in harm’s way. He said he’s ""not so sure of"" the idea that owning and carrying guns makes people safer.

He also threw out this claim about gun violence: ""You know, the bulk of the people who are shot with a weapon — other than these drug gangs taking on one another — end up being shot with their own weapon.""

We decided to check that out.

Biden’s office pointed us to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which shows that the majority of firearm deaths in the U.S. are by suicide, and most suicides are committed with the deceased's own gun.

David Hemenway, a public health professor at Harvard University, looked at 2009 specifically and noted that the CDC figures show 18,735 firearm suicides; 11,493 firearm homicides; and some 554 unintentional firearm deaths. ""The large majority of firearm suicides use their own (or the family gun), while the large majority of firearm homicides are shot with someone else’s gun,"" Hemenway said.

So Biden’s statement, in Hemenway’s estimation, is ""very likely true"" if Biden was talking only about firearm deaths.

Statistics that include non-fatal shootings paint a different picture, with more resulting from assaults than from suicides.

""The estimates of non-fatal shootings are very rough (estimated from under 100 emergency departments), but the CDC estimates from 2009 are only 3,000 plus non-fatal suicide shootings, compared to over 44,000 assault shootings,"" he said.

Including non-fatal shootings in the study group, Hemenway said, makes Biden’s statement ""very likely untrue"" because people don’t typically become the victim of assaults with their own guns.

Donald Braman, a law professor at George Washington University, also said the statement is ""probably technically true but also misleading as most gun fatalities are suicides.""

""Biden's claim implies that people are having their weapons turned against them by someone else when, in fact, the modal gun death is probably a debt-ridden farmer,"" Braman wrote in an email.

We agree that Biden did not seem to be talking about suicides. He was answering a question about self-defense laws and the danger of people putting themselves in harm’s way. And certainly the Martin killing was unrelated to suicide.

""What Biden seems to be saying,"" Braman wrote, ""is that the likelihood that you will shoot someone with a gun you buy in self-defense is smaller than the likelihood that you (or someone in your household) will be shot with that same gun. That is technically true unless you start excluding suicides, etc. -- then I don't know -- and he's got a point: guns most often injure people in the gun owner's household, not an intruder or stranger.  

""But it is also potentially misleading in two ways. First, it suggests that people who buy guns are more likely to be harmed than protected by a gun they buy. We just don't have good data on that. … Second, it suggests that the harms people are suffering are at the hands of others, when (as I pointed out before) most of the time it is a suicide or suicide attempt.""

Our ruling

Biden said ""the bulk"" of people who are shot with a weapon are shot with their own weapon. The numbers that back up that statement refer only to fatal shootings, including a high proportion of suicides. CDC figures show, and our experts verified, that the majority of gun deaths are suicides, and the majority of suicides are committed with a person’s own gun or a gun owned by someone in the household.

Although the numbers for non-fatal shootings are rough, such assaults typically don't involve the use of the victim's gun, experts told us. Biden cited a true statistic but left out the important detail and context that he was talking only about fatal shootings, which would include suicides. That meets our definition of Half True.",/factchecks/2012/apr/16/joe-biden/biden-says-most-shootings-happen-victims-own-gun/

BettyLou DeCroce claims states without income taxes grew jobs from 2001 to 2010
","
Though the job market is bleak for some, a Republican assemblywoman claims Gov. Chris Christie’s proposed income tax cut promises a brighter future.

BettyLou DeCroce, a Republican representing parts of Morris, Essex and Passaic counties, recently penned a column touting Christie’s proposal to reduce personal income tax rates by 10 percent over three years.

""We need to build momentum with an across-the-board tax cut to boost the recovery and give New Jersey a competitive advantage in attracting new jobs to our state,"" DeCroce wrote in an April 8 column in the Gloucester County Times.

""While the country’s economy was battered, nine states with no income tax actually grew jobs from 2001 to 2010. If states without an income tax added jobs during the Great Recession, imagine how many more jobs New Jersey can grow by reducing taxes during the recovery. The next job created could be yours,"" she said.

With several tax cut plans swirling around Trenton, DeCroce’s claim caught our attention. Have states with no personal income tax fared better than the nation on job growth?

The nation lost more than two million jobs from 2001 to 2010, according to federal labor data. On average states without a personal income tax experienced job growth, but two of those states lost jobs. And the connection between income taxes and job growth is murky.

Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and Wyoming do not levy a personal income tax. New Hampshire and Tennessee only tax interest and dividend income.

Greg Volpe, a spokesman for the Assembly Republicans, pointed to a Wall Street Journal article from February about governors pushing to cut or abolish their state’s personal income tax and a report from the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative group based in Washington, D.C.

The group’s 2012 report found that on average the nine states without personal income taxes experienced employment growth of 5.36 percent during the last decade.

But New Hampshire and Tennessee actually lost jobs during the same time frame. And other states the report identified as having high personal income tax rates, such as Hawaii and Maryland, gained jobs from 2001 to 2010.

DeCroce called those states ""statistical outliers"" and said in a written statement they ""do not change the fact that states with no personal income tax were more successful in creating jobs than high-tax states during the last decade.""

But Richard Pomp, a professor of law at the University of Connecticut and state taxation expert said, ""you can’t bury bad news with good news. You have to take those as contradictions. Right away it shows you it’s not uniform. There’s more going on than just whether there’s an income tax or not."" Pomp noted population growth and natural resources as other factors.

Alan Auerbach, professor of economics and law at University of California, Berkeley, said in an e-mail that grouping states without a personal income tax is ""OK if one wants a summary measure of growth in those states, but the exercise of trying to explain growth differences using just one factor doesn't make a lot of sense, particularly when one is considering a relatively short period of time.""

DeCroce said although others ""may have different economic opinions, I still believe the best way to grow jobs in New Jersey is by reducing government spending and cutting income taxes.""

Our ruling

DeCroce said in an opinion column: ""While the country’s economy was battered, nine states with no income tax actually grew jobs from 2001 to 2010.""

A conservative group found that on average states that don’t levy personal income taxes had more job growth during the past decade than the national average.

But the absence of an income tax isn’t the only factor driving growth. In fact, two of the nine states without personal income taxes lost jobs between 2001 and 2010. And two states the conservative group points out as having high personal income tax rates gained jobs during the same decade.

We rate this claim Half True.

Clarence Thomas gives Supreme Court history lesson
","
The U.S. Supreme Court’s least loquacious member had much to say -- more than any of his fellow justices, actually -- about a recent landmark hearing.

Justice Clarence Thomas criticized some of his colleagues for asking too many questions during the three-day oral arguments held in late March on the federal government’s controversial health care law. A decision is expected in June.

""I don’t see where that advances anything,"" Thomas, a Savannah-area native, said of the questions while he was speaking at the University of Kentucky. ""Maybe it’s the Southerner in me. Maybe it’s the introvert in me, I don’t know. I think that when somebody’s talking, somebody ought to listen.""

Thomas, who’s been on the bench since 1991 and is known for rarely asking questions during oral arguments, went on.

""I don’t like to badger people,"" the justice was quoted by The Associated Press. ""These are not children. The court traditionally did not do that. I have been there 20 years. I see no need for all of that. Most of that is in the briefs, and there are a few questions around the edges.""

We wondered if Thomas was accurate when he argued that the Supreme Court didn’t ""traditionally"" ask many questions or ""badger"" lawyers arguing cases before them. Thomas wasn’t specific about the time frame he meant when he said ""traditionally."" A Supreme Court spokeswoman said she was unable to help us clarify because she did not have a transcript of Thomas’ remarks.

The court’s online transcripts of oral arguments go back only to 2000, so we recognized it would be difficult to make an accurate comparison to cases dating back decades. Instead, PolitiFact Georgia talked to several Supreme Court experts to get their thoughts about the Thomas claim. They said Thomas has a good argument, but noted some changes over the years that must be considered to fully understand his statement.

The court currently gives each side about 30 minutes to argue its case. In the court’s early days, oral arguments would sometimes last hours -- or days. In 1849, the court limited oral arguments to two hours per side. The court had larger caseloads and needed time to hear the additional cases.

In 1925, the court contracted the time again, to one hour for each side. In 1970, the court cut the time limit again, to its present limit of 30 minutes for each side.

""That was a function of them hearing so many cases,"" said Emory University political science professor Tom Clark, the author of a book on judicial independence.

Clark was dubious of Thomas’ claim, saying the justice was ""being a good politician"" by not specifying what he meant by ""traditionally"" and not considering some of the context of changes in how the court operates.

Timothy Johnson, a widely respected expert on Supreme Court oral arguments, also noted those changes to us via email. However, he thought Thomas was correct.

""The justices [say in the 19th century] did not ask many questions. But this was during the time before briefs were filed. Rather, the arguments were more like the British system where all arguments were presented right in open court. Thus, without briefs the justices had to listen to find out the arguments rather than try to clarify them from the briefs or inject their own thoughts,"" said Johnson, a University of Minnesota law school professor who wrote a book in 2004 on Supreme Court oral arguments.

Johnson also co-authored a 2009 study that explored whether the court gives hints of how the justices will rule on a case by the number of questions they ask each side. In general, they found, the side asked more questions typically loses.

Johnson conducted research on how many times each justice spoke between 1998 and 2007. Thomas spoke 34 times, an average of less than four times a year. The next lowest on the list was Justice Samuel Alito, who spoke 816 times. Compare that to Justice Antonin Scalia, who spoke 18,122 times.

Thomas has maintained the same rationale to explain why he doesn’t speak much during oral arguments. It’s rude, he says. Kathleen Burch, who teaches constitutional law at John Marshall Law School in Atlanta, said most of the justices ""seem to want to jump in more"" in the last 15 to 20 years. She guessed that is because more of them have served as appeals court judges, where they are more aggressive in questioning attorneys. Elena Kagan is the only current justice who did not serve as an appeals court judge.

""I think historically it would be true,"" Burch, who has taught at John Marshall for nine years, said of Thomas’ statement. ""I think it’s becoming more common to ask questions than be quiet.""

Thomas, the third-longest tenured justice on the court, is apparently old school. The experts we interviewed mostly agreed that it’s fair to say that justices ask more questions today than they did a century ago or as recently as 40 years ago. They note that changes such as being provided with briefs before oral arguments have made the justices better versed on cases beforehand -- and perhaps more likely to ask questions. We considered that a minor point that doesn’t change our impression of Thomas’ statement.

Wisconsin recall target Gov. Scott Walker says teen sons ""targeted"" on Facebook
","
When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said his two teen sons have been ""targeted"" on Facebook, the news was quickly picked up by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and national outlets such as Fox News, Politico, Talking Points Memo, the Daily Beast and the Huffington Post.

Walker didn't elaborate on his claim in the April 4, 2012 interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network.

But in a March 31, 2012 speech to the Waukesha County Republican Party in suburban Milwaukee, he disclosed a few more details:

""People ask me all the time: How do you do deal with all the grief? How do you deal with the thousands of people who were bused in in front of your house in Wauwatosa? How do you deal with the hecklers, how do you deal with attacks? The kids had stuff on Facebook targeted after them by out-of-state protesters and other things like that.""

The first-term Republican governor has repeatedly claimed that out-of-state interests backed public demonstrations against him and are promoting efforts to remove him from office in the June 5, 2012 recall election. And after Walker stripped most Wisconsin public employees of most collective bargaining powers with a March 2011 law that spurred the demonstrations and the recall, Republican politicians as well as Democrats who opposed the law received death threats.

In November 2011, authorities investigated but did not file charges against a woman who posted a message about Walker on Facebook saying: ""Rather than recall him. can we kill him instead? Just curious."" And a Madison radio talk show host in November 2011 criticized Walker’s wife, Tonette, and called her names when she said on Milwaukee radio that she worried for her sons’ safety after protesters demonstrated outside of their home.

Facebook claim 
But Walker saying family members have been targeted on Facebook is a new dimension.

Walker campaign spokeswoman Ciara Matthews pointed to a December 2011 article by the MacIver Institute, a conservative think tank and news organization in Madison.

The article said that on Nov. 27, 2011, Miles Kristan posted this message (complete with the grammatical errors) on Facebook:

""Whats it like having the most hated dad in Wisconsin ??? this kid knows.""

A picture accompanying the article shows the post, which included a link to Matt Walker's Facebook page; the link included a photo of Matt Walker.

According to the article, after posting the item about Matt Walker, Kristan immediately posted another message saying ""this kid knows as well,"" with a link to Alex Walker's Facebook page.

Both posts were also shown in a news report on WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) in Milwaukee.

So, there is evidence that Walker's sons, both of whom attend a public high school in suburban Milwaukee, were ""targeted"" at least one time on Facebook.

Matthews did not provide other examples.

We also contacted Jocelyn Webster, a spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Capitol Police. She told us the department does not comment on security issues.

As for Kristan, he is a protester, but he’s not from out of state.

Kristan has been identified in news reports as a Wisconsin resident and a native of Racine, south of Milwaukee, who moved to Madison to participate in protests against Walker. He was also identified as a leader of some of the protests.

State court records list Kristan with Wisconsin addresses dating back to 2003 and as recently as February 2012. They also show he was convicted of misdemeanor disorderly conduct after pouring a beer on state Rep. Robin Vos, R-Rochester, in a Madison bar in September 2011.

‘Gas out’ boycott in 1997 pushed gasoline prices down 30 cents overnight, according to Facebook posts
","
Pump up the volume on your car radio. Pump up the air in your tires.

Just don't pump any gas today, a Facebook post urges.

A one-day gas boycott would remove billions of dollars from the pockets of oil companies ""so please do not go to the gas station on April 15th and let's try to put a dent in the Middle Eastern oil industry for at least one day,"" the post says.

Fifteen years ago, drivers held a successful boycott, according to the post. ""In April 1997, there was a ‘gas out’ conducted nationwide in protest of gas prices. Gasoline prices dropped 30 cents a gallon overnight,"" it says.

The ""gas out"" claim has been circulating online for years. As prices at the pump tick up every spring the Internet buzzes with calls for a boycott: if it worked in 1997, why not now? Because it didn’t work then, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

The Facebook post recycles material from chain e-mails. Patrick DeHaan, a senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy.com, called the claim ""an outright myth/lie"" and said there’s no evidence to support it.

PolitiFact New Jersey reviewed news archives and found no mention of a boycott in 1997, except in more recent articles referring to the chain e-mails and posts on social networking sites. There were movements pushing national gas boycotts in 1999 and 2000. News reports and data show both efforts gained little support and gas prices had no major fluctuations at the time of the boycotts.

That was also the case for gas prices in April 1997.

Historical data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which tracks the weekly national average for gasoline, shows costs varied by less than a penny. On April 7, 1997, a gallon of regular gasoline on average cost roughly $1.19. At the end of the month, the same gallon cost about $1.18.

DeHaan said there’s little chance the federal data wouldn’t catch such a dramatic swing in prices and ""odds are with such a huge percentage drop in prices in the late 90s, it would have been noticed.""

Also, he added, ""if there was any single day ‘gas out,’ it would never have a direct impact such as what is suggested. Shifting demand from the gas out day to the day before or after results in zero change in gasoline demand and, therefore, has no impact on overall demand.""

Avery Ash, manager of regulatory affairs at the automotive club, AAA, said the premise of the one-day boycott ""just doesn’t make economic sense.""

""It’s not ultimately going to have any impact on sales, on consumption,"" he said.

So New Jerseyans will keep paying $3.79 for a gallon of regular-grade gasoline, the average according to AAA, and a one-day boycott won’t change that price.

Our ruling

With rising gas prices, calls for a one-day gas boycott are again making the rounds. A Facebook post promoting a ""gas out"" for April 15  said: ""In April 1997, there was a ‘gas out’ conducted nationwide in protest of gas prices. Gasoline prices dropped 30 cents a gallon overnight.""

There’s no evidence and no data to support this claim. The average cost of a gallon of regular gasoline varied by less than a penny in April 1997.

Stand back, readers. This claim is highly flammable: Pants on Fire!

Lamar Alexander says child farm labor rules could prohibit certain tasks, hurt family farms
","
Update (April 27, 2012): On Thursday, the Department of Labor withdrew the proposed changes to the child labor rule in response to opposition from lawmakers and farmers. It actually came out just hours after our partners at PolitiFact Florida had posted a ruling on a similar claim by Florida Congressman Tom Rooney.

A Department of Labor press release dated April 26 reads: ""The decision to withdraw this rule – including provisions to define the 'parental exemption' – was made in response to thousands of comments expressing concerns about the effect of the proposed rules on small family-owned farms. To be clear, this regulation will not be pursued for the duration of the Obama administration."" It added that the department will instead work with rural stakeholders to develop a program to promote safety.

The Department of Labor’s announcement -- while good news for Alexander and Rooney and others who opposed the rule -- does not affect our rating in this fact-check. Alexander and Rooney failed to prove that children working on farms would be banned from operating a battery-powered screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose, and the Department of Labor specifically said those activities would not be prohibited under the proposed rule.

--------------- 
Tennessee’s senior senator has co-sponsored a bill to prevent the Department of Labor from enacting proposed rules regarding child labor in agricultural settings. He says the rules are over the top – they ""take the cake,"" he says – and take ""job opportunities from our nation’s youth.""

Alexander is talking about  proposed changes in the Fair Labor Standards Act regarding child labor on farms that take up 49 pages of fine print in the Federal Register published on Sept. 2 of last year. According to a Dec. 12, 2011, post from U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, ""We want to ensure that children of farm families maintain their ability to help with the family farm, while working to prevent unnecessary child injuries or deaths."" According to Vilsack, ""while only 4 percent of working youth are in the agriculture sector, 40 percent of fatalities of working kids are associated with machines, equipment, or facilities related to agriculture.""

So we decided to look at whether the proposed rules would prohibit some kid under 18 from carting a load of alfalfa to the manger or tightening up a license plate on a pickup before heading out on the blacktop.

First, we asked Alexander’s office specifically for support for his contention that the bill would prevent children from using a power screwdriver or wheelbarrows. Alexander spokesman Jim Jeffries cautioned that the senator only said ""could,"" not ""would,"" but he also provided the text of the rule dealing with unpowered conveyances that he says could apply to wheelbarrows:

""The proposed Ag H.O. would prohibit hired farm workers under 16 years of age from operating and assisting in the operation of hoisting apparatus and conveyors that are not power-driven but run on human power or gravity, including manlifts and boatswain-chair-type devices often used in grain storage operations.""

It goes on to spell things out in even more specific detail, though never mentions wheelbarrows.
It’s pretty arcane stuff and there’s a lot of legalese in the proposed rules, making them an easy target for ridicule, but it is a serious set of rules.

The release finishes by claiming: ""It would even ban youth from operating a battery-powered screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose.""

When Alexander’s office pointed to the rules themselves for support, we looked them over. A search for ""milking equipment"" did quickly lead to a section listing various kinds of ""power-driven machinery"" that could not be used by working children and student learners (like kids with 4-H and Future Farmers of America) and milking equipment was not only listed but singled out for explanation. The section says that  ""a study of 988 worker's compensation claims among dairy farms in Colorado found that milking parlor tasks represented 48% of injuries among dairy workers and  indicated the worker was performing a milking activity at the time of the injury.""

However, the third sentence of the first paragraph of the summary of the proposed rules changes, as published by the DOL, reads as follows: ""The proposed agricultural revisions would impact only hired farm workers and in no way compromise the statutory child labor parental exemption involving children working on farms owned or operated by their parents."" So, no matter the government rules, if a parent with some ownership in the farm tells a child to crank up the milking machine, there’s nothing to prohibit it.

That seems like an important and broad exception, given that the bill sponsored by Alexander and 44 others has as its title: ""Preserving America's Family Farm Act."" If you’re working your own parent’s farm, the new rules don’t apply at all, and the act also contains many exemptions for programs, like 4-H, aimed at giving youth experience working on farms.

If Alexander meant some other family’s farm, where the child is a paid laborer, it’s worth noting that The Child Labor Coalition pointed out there were 16 fatal injuries in 2011 of children working under the age of 16 -- 12  of them involving crop production. The Department of Labor has come under significant attack for this attempt to more closely align child labor rules on farms with labor rules for other work, and it has responded by saying it believes it has a public duty to look after child laborers being paid to work on a farm not belonging to their parent.

Technically, the new rules don’t specifically mention screwdrivers, wheelbarrows or garden hoses. The Department of Labor told us the rules would not in fact prevent their use by children working on a farm.   

""There is no part of Senator Alexander’s press release that accurately reflects the proposed rule,"" a spokesperson for the Department of Labor wrote in an email. The department also points out there has been substantial time for public review, and it will take into consideration the huge amount of feedback the rules have received.  

As with a lot of commentary on alleged over-regulation and government overreach into the realm of private business, we suspected there might be more to Alexander’s and many others’ concerns that do not involve wheelbarrows full of alfalfa or showing Bessie off at the county fair. Might the pushback be related to migrant child labor employed by big agribusiness concerns?

Typical of the more than 4,100 written submissions  from the public are those from Cliff and Bertha Gardner of Ruby Valley, Nev., who wrote: ""This rule will have a dramatic effect on our Ranching Operation. We will not be able to work our Grandchildren, Nieces and Nephews. It is much better to teach these young people to work at an early age than have them getting into trouble in town because there is nothing to do.""

David Arbogast, in his public submission to the DOL, skated a little closer to what really may be at stake for big agribusiness interests when he asked, ""Could this proposal also be racially motivated to further block Latino children from working the fields with their parents? Again, the government has no business meddling in the family’s parenting duties.""

The American Farm Bureau Federation’s submission, the Washington-based non-profit promoting agriculture, asked that the federal rules not duplicate regulations on the books at the state level. In Washington State, it points out, minors as young as 12 pick strawberries and farms hire teachers, school bus drivers ""and others in the supervision of the minor work crews."" In California, it notes, minors 12 and 13 may work in agriculture up to 8 hours a day and 40 hours a week ""on non-school days.""

It turns out many children work in agribusiness enterprises side by side with impoverished migrant worker adults, and a lot of them get injured. While it may be quaint, the image of a farm boy in overalls may be a misleading focus for rules seeking to address the reality of child labor on those farms that actually generate most of the nation’s food. The last week of March was National Farmworker Awareness Week, some of it focused on child labor.

A peer-reviewed article in the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics  noted: ""Relatively few adolescents are employed on farms compared with other types of industry, yet the proportion of fatalities in agriculture is higher than that for any other type of adolescent employment.""

Clearly, the rationale for the upgraded standards is a concern for the welfare of young workers and for minimizing specific workplace injuries the department has investigated. That’s what the rules actually say; they’re based on actual injuries. The report in some sections is not for the squeamish, detailing sometimes gruesome injuries and deaths like youths chewed up in various kinds of machinery. Such concerns date to the turn of the last century and are memorialized in the findings of the National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health which routinely look at promoting safe work conditions for young workers. You can see an example of the agency’s concern from 1999 here.

""The reason the labor laws are in place is…because there have been kids who have been hurt,"" said Diane E. Bush, coordinator of the Labor Occupational Health Program at the University of California-Berkeley. ""Most people think of the workplace as a safe place where young people are going to learn responsibility and it will have a positive impact on them.

""It’s important to make sure they’re working in an environment where that’s going to happen, rather than ending up with a serious or even worse, a fatal injury.""

Our ruling

The proposed rules could limit the kinds of potentially dangerous work children might perform on ""family"" farms owned by someone else’s family. To make their point, however, Alexander and many others are not mentioning the parental exemption and then using examples of some activities the labor department says are not the target of its revised rules.

The proposed rules are aimed at protecting children involved in agribusiness, not at children learning farming from their flannel-clad dads. We find the orchestrated criticism misleading and rule Alexander’s statement Mostly False.

No limit on gifts to Ga. legislature, senator says
","
Georgia state Sen. Joshua McKoon, by some accounts, committed political suicide this year.

The freshman Republican from Columbus proposed legislation to cap gifts from lobbyists to state lawmakers at $100. Statehouse leaders apparently didn’t care for his approach, removing McKoon from a committee to study the idea. There’s been mumbling, as one former senator put it, that Republicans were recruiting a candidate to run against McKoon.

""I have not been making a lot of friends inside the Capitol,"" McKoon said, when asked by PolitiFact Georgia about his proposal.

Throughout the legislative session, McKoon attempted to buttress his argument with a fact to help fellow lawmakers see the light.

Georgia, he said, is one of three states that ""effectively have no regulations whatsoever on lobbyists giving to legislators.""

The other states, he says, are Indiana and South Dakota.

McKoon held a news conference last month and pointed to a map of the United States with those three states in red. So, is McKoon correct?

Government watchdog groups have argued ardently in recent years that Georgia needs to tighten its ethics laws and make it more difficult for lobbyists to influence state lawmakers with gifts of meals or trips. A recent joint report by the Center for Public Integrity and Global Integrity ranked Georgia last in the nation in the strength of its laws on public corruption and government openness. Some state lawmakers called the report biased.

Georgia code section 21-5-11 spells out the policy on gifts. It says that only statewide elected officials can accept gifts of more than $100 for a speech, seminar or panel discussion that directly relates to the duties of that official, but prohibits it otherwise. It states no rules for members of the Georgia Legislature or other types of gifts. 

A section on prohibited lobbying practices, Title 28, Chapter 7, mentions nothing about gift limits.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution took a close look at lobbyists during the recent legislative session. A recent AJC story found lobbyists spent $866,747 --- the equivalent of $9,525 per day --- on gifts for lawmakers from Jan. 1 through March 31.

Many of the gifts would have easily surpassed the $100 limit McKoon proposed. For example, the AJC found lobbyists took Rep. Mickey Channell, R-Greensboro, and his wife to dinner on Valentine’s Day, spending about $230. Another House member, Rahn Mayo, D-Decatur, said he was unaware that the four Atlanta Hawks basketball tickets that lobbyists gave him cost about $500.

House Speaker David Ralston has defended the current system, saying eliminating lobbying gifts would drive the practice ""underground,"" where the public would know less about what is happening between lawmakers and special interests.

So how does Georgia compare with other states when it comes to laws on gifts from lobbyists?

The National Conference of State Legislatures has a chart that examines gift policy in each state. McKoon said he used the NCSL chart to make his claim. Many states employ what’s referred to as the ""cup of coffee"" policy, which prohibits any gifts whatsoever from lobbyists. About a dozen states set the limit at $100. Four states set the limit at $250. A handful limit gifts from lobbyists to between $250 and $1,000.

The NCSL chart says Indiana requires lobbyists to report gifts, but does not specify any limits of what they can give lawmakers. In 2010, state lawmakers changed some of the rules on gifts from lobbyists. They must now disclose any gifts in a day greater than $50. Before, the limit was $100, said Julia Vaughn, Common Cause Indiana policy director.

""We don’t limit. We require some disclosure,"" Vaughn said.

Vaughn said some state lawmakers argue a gift ban isn’t necessary because it’s better for the public to know what they’re getting from lobbyists.

In South Dakota, the code section on lobbyists mentions nothing about gift limits for lobbyists. The NCSL lists South Dakota as having ""no restrictions.""

We found no discrepancies in the NCSL’s research. The current laws in Georgia, Indiana and South Dakota afford lobbyists freedom to give state lawmakers as much as they want. We rate McKoon’s claim as True.",/factchecks/2012/apr/15/joshua-mckoon/no-limit-gifts-ga-legislature-senator-says/
"['Rhode Island', 'Deficit', 'Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'Taxes', 'Barry Hinckley']","
Republican Senate candidate Barry Hinckley says the “Buffett rule” would raise the equivalent of “a day and a half” of what the nation borrows every year.
","
When Mitt Romney was in Rhode Island last week as part of his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, GOP Senate candidate Benjamin ""Barry"" Hinckley III asked him a question about the Obama administration’s effort to raise taxes on the wealthy.

Hinckley -- who is challenging Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the lead sponsor of the so-called ""Buffet Rule"" legislation -- asked how Romney would respond to the tax plan.

As part of his introduction to the question, Hinckley dismissed the bill as part of the ""politics of envy"" and described it as ""a plan that is so obviously political because it raises virtually no money, maybe a day and a half of our borrowing per year.""

The bill,  which is officially known as the Paying a Fair Share Act, would increase the income tax rate on those who earn more than $1 million annually to 30 percent. It was inspired by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has said it is unfair that he is able to use tax loopholes to pay a lower effective rate than his secretary. The Senate is set to vote on the bill Monday.

Other opponents of the legislation have questioned how much money it would actually raise and whether it would make a dent in the national debt. But does the amount really correspond to just ""a day and a half"" of what the United States borrows annually?

Hinckley’s statement relies on two numbers -- how much the nation borrows on a daily basis and how much the Buffet rule would raise per year.

While we waited to hear back from Hinckley’s campaign, we started researching the issue, starting with what the federal government borrows to cover the national debt, a subject we have explored before. PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Georgia also have all written pieces on the national debt and what it works out to per day.

We’ll use the same rationale as those items from 2011 but update the numbers. The national debt is the total amount of money owed by the federal government to creditors who have loaned the government money.

That debt has grown by an average of $4.2 billion per day since January 2009. The rate has slowed down more recently. Since January 2012, the average daily increase has been about $3.9 billion. The total debt stood at $15.6 trillion as of April 11, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

As Politifact Florida made clear, the government does not borrow money every day to stay afloat. Rather, it does so by periodically auctioning bonds. But the logic of calculating the borrowing per day is reasonable. For our purposes, we’ll use a rate of borrowing of $3.9 billion per day.

The second part of Hinckley’s statement -- how much the Buffett rule would raise -- is based on a projection from Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation, according to Whitehouse spokesman Seth Larson. The committee estimated that increasing the tax rate paid by the wealthiest Americans would raise $47 billion over 10 years, or $4.7 billion a year.

But that estimate is based on a comparison to the ""current law baseline,"" which assumes the full expiration of the Bush tax cuts.  

If the Bush tax cuts are extended -- a distinct possibility with a Republican-controlled House -- then the Buffet rule would raise $160 billion over 10 years, or $16 billion a year.

Both are valid estimates.

""They’re two separate projections based on two different scenarios,"" said Larson.

A spokesman for Hinckley said that the candidate used the $4.7 billion figure and a range of estimates for borrowing that, at the high end, is nearly identical to our number. So if we divide $4.7 billion by $3.9 billion, we get 1.2, or the equivalent of 1 day and about 5 hours. That’s actually less than a day and a half.

If we use the $16 billion figure, we calculated the Buffet rule would raise the equivalent of about four days of the nation’s borrowing.

Our ruling

Senate candidate Barry Hinckley says the Buffett rule would annually raise only ""a day and a half"" of what the federal government borrows every year.

Our calculations yield a number closer to a day and a quarter, which would actually bolster Hinckley’s point that the tax plan raises ""virtually no money.""

In relative terms, he may have a point, but $4.7 billion is not a small amount of money. (Rhode Island’s total budget is $7.7 billion.) Moreover, by another estimate, increasing taxes on the wealthy could raise $16 billion a year, or the equivalent of four days of the nation’s borrowing.

Because of that issue and others related to calculating the national debt per day, Hinckley’s is not a perfect comparison. Because the statement needs clarification, we rate it Mostly True.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Joe Biden']","
Joe Biden says people earning $200,000 already pay 30 percent tax rate
","
The White House has recently mounted several public events to rally support for a proposal it calls the ""Buffett Rule"" -- a provision that would ensure that the richest Americans wouldn’t pay federal income tax rates lower than that of middle-income Americans.

During an April 12, 2012, visit to Exeter, N.H., Vice President Joe Biden focused his speech on the proposal. Here’s a portion of what Biden said:

""No one who makes a million dollars or more in any single given year will pay at an effective tax rate that's less than 30 percent."" Later, he added, ""Anybody making a million dollars can't pay 30 percent in taxes? That's lower than the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already -- not just for millionaires, for people making over $200,000.""

We wondered if Biden got his math right.

The first thing we noticed about Biden’s speech is its definition of the Buffett Rule, which stems from billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s observation that his secretary paid a higher tax rate than he did. It differed from what appeared in a White House web page on the topic.

The White House website defines the Buffett Rule without citing a specific tax rate: ""No household making more than $1 million each year should pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than a middle class family pays,"" the Web page says.

It turns out that the White House has filled in some of the operational details elsewhere, and the 30 percent rate is indeed what the rule would require.

The president’s fiscal year 2013 budget proposal said that ""those making over $1 million should pay no less than 30 percent of their income in taxes. The administration will work to ensure that this rule is implemented in a way that is equitable, including not disadvantaging individuals who make large charitable contributions. And he is proposing that the Buffett rule should replace the Alternative Minimum Tax, which now burdens middle-class Americans rather than stopping the richest Americans from paying too little as was originally intended.""

So is it true, as Biden said, that the 30 percent tax rate ""is lower than the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already -- not just for millionaires, for people making over $200,000.""

That’s a complicated question to answer.

A big part of the confusion comes from Biden’s blurring how tax rates work in his speech.

Currently, the federal income tax has six ""brackets"" -- ranges of taxable income for which there is a specified tax rate, known as the marginal rate. They are 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent and 35 percent. For instance, every taxpayer filing as an individual -- no matter how rich or poor -- pays a 10 percent tax rate on the first $8,700 of income. For the next $26,650, taxpayers pay 15 percent, and so on, all the way up to 35 percent for all income above $388,350. The income cutoffs are different for married couples filing jointly and for heads of households.

To make this real, let’s take a look at sample taxpayers at the two income levels Biden cited -- $200,000 and $1 million -- using this Web-based tax calculator.

• Individual earning $200,000. This taxpayer would be in the 33 percent tax bracket -- every dollar over $178,650 would be taxed at 33 percent. However, taking into account the lower tax rates for the dollars earned below $178,650, the effective tax rate for this filer would be just over 25 percent.

• Married couple earning $200,000 filing jointly. This couple would be in the 28 percent tax bracket -- every dollar over $142,700 would be taxed at 28 percent. However, taking into account the lower tax rates for the dollars earned below $142,700, the effective tax rate for this couple would be a little under 22 percent.

• Individual earning $1 million. This person would be in the 35 percent tax bracket, with an effective tax rate of 32.7 percent.

• Married couple earning $1 million filing jointly. This couple would be in the 35 percent tax bracket, and their effective tax rate would be a little under 32 percent.

Two issues. First, looking only at the highest marginal rates paid, Biden is correct for three of these categories and incorrect on one. Married couples earning $200,000 face a marginal tax rate of 28 percent, not 30 percent.

Second, taking into account the total tax paid as a percentage of income, Biden is correct that individuals and couples making $1 million a year already face effective rates in excess of 30 percent, but individuals and couples earning $200,000 face effective rates significantly lower than 30 percent -- about 22 percent for couples and 25 percent for individuals. A married couple would have to earn $617,000 to face an effective tax rate of 30 percent, and an individual would need to earn $465,000.

We should point out that these calculations assume that the taxable income in question is subject to the tax rates levied on ordinary income. In reality, many richer Americans earn a portion of income from capital gains, which are taxed less heavily than most of the ordinary income brackets -- 15 percent. So the effective tax rate for these taxpayers will be lower than the rates cited above. This is what prompted Warren Buffett to write the column that led to the Buffett Rule in the first place. But since it’s not possible for us to construct a model to gauge this factor, we won’t be including it in our discussion.

Our ruling

In the speech, Biden mixed and matched two different types of tax rates -- marginal tax rates, which refer to the rate paid on the last dollar of income, and effective tax rates, which refer to the percentage of income someone ultimately paid in taxes. When Biden says the rate required by the Buffett Rule ""is lower than the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already,"" he’s comparing the percentage of income paid as taxes (the Buffett Rule) to a marginal tax rate (""the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already""). Making this comparison is mixing apples and oranges.

In the meantime, if you look at the effective tax rates paid by the two groups he’s talking about, he’s right that millionaires already have an effective tax rate of at least 30 percent, assuming their income doesn’t include capital gains -- but he’s wrong when he says that taxpayers earning $200,000 do. In fact, taxpayers would have to have much higher taxable incomes before facing that rate -- $617,000 for married couples and $465,000 for individuals. Overall, Biden’s claim is a mixture of accurate and inaccurate information. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2012/apr/13/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-people-earning-200000-already-pay-3/

DeFazio says the Pentagon can’t track its budget; we audit the claim
","
At $530 billion this fiscal year, the budget for the Department of Defense is the federal government’s largest agency and third biggest spending item, trailing only the amount spent on Social Security and the two big health programs Medicare and Medicaid.

Even so, the Pentagon and its friends in the White House and in Congress keep asking for more. (The fiscal 2013 budget released by the White House reduces defense spending to $525 billion in 2013 before boosting it to $534 billion in 2014 and $546 billion in 2015. The budget proposal written by House Republicans calls for $554 billion for defense next year.)

Having a budget for the Pentagon is a curious thing, according to Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore. The reason? The Pentagon, he says, has no idea how much money it actually has or how much it actually spends or wastes.

The reason, DeFazio says, is both obvious and outrageous.

""Despite the fact that the Pentagon is the largest and most expensive department in the federal government, it has never passed a financial audit,"" he says on his House website. ""In fact, under current law, the Pentagon is exempt from a federal law that requires all federal agencies to complete annual audits.""

What? Really? At a time when politicians and voters alike are obsessed with deficits and government spending, the agency with the biggest annual budget - by far - has never been able to fully audit its spending and isn’t required to do so?

Let’s take a look.

The best place to start is 1990, when Congress passed legislation requiring all federal agencies to present ""auditable financial statements."" It was a reasonable standard for most agencies to satisfy and every federal department did, except one: the Pentagon.

The Pentagon has promised to create a system to make its books ""auditable"" by 2017. Congress accepted the pledge, which was an estimate rather than a hard ""mandate.""

It’s important to note that auditing your books is a two-step process. First, as any business person knows, you have to have a system in place to track income and expenses and other parts of your budget. Meeting that goal makes you ""auditable.""

Once there, you can have an audit that provides a detailed thumbnail of your financial well-being.

The Pentagon hasn’t accomplished either one.

DeFazio sponsored an amendment to the defense bill last year that requires the Pentagon to organize its books so they can be audited. That step has yet to be satisfied and DeFazio’s measure was stripped during negotiations  between the House and Senate.

Independent reports of the Pentagon’s problems monitoring its budgets continue to pile up.

As far back as 1995, the General Accountability Office, the independent investigative arm of Congress, deemed the Pentagon’s financial management to be ""high risk.""

In 2000, the GAO  found that nearly one third of the accounting entries in the Pentagon's budget were untraceable.

In 2009, the GAO said its auditors ""have continued to report significant weaknesses in the department’s ability to provide timely, reliable, consistent, and accurate information for management analysis, decision-making, and reporting.""

The next year, the GAO found that half of the Pentagon's $366 billion in contract awards were never even completed.

And in yet another 2010 report, the GAO found that the Pentagon’s effort to install a system to make itself ""auditable"" were taking on the personality of a new weapons system - over budget and behind schedule. In this case, the GAO said that two-thirds of the systems the Department of Defense is putting in place to make its budget auditable have slipped years in implementation and doubled in cost -- to more than $13 billion.

The GAO also showed why the ability of the Pentagon to audit itself is important. Among the problems: 

The Pentagon does not dispute DeFazio’s claim.

In an appearance before the Senate Budget Committee in March, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta declared that the department would be fully auditable by 2014 instead of waiting until 2017. He acknowledged it’s ""crazy"" that the department is still unable to audit its finances. ""That's, frankly, something we owe the taxpayer,"" he said.

Therefore, with the audit of DeFazio’s statement complete, we rate his claim: True.

Biden administration didn’t lose 20 million COVID-19 vaccines
","A conservative commentator known for his support of former President Donald Trump attacked the Biden administration over its role overseeing the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.  ""The Biden Administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines… This entire administration is a joke,"" tweeted Ryan Fournier, founder of the group Students for Trump. As evidence, Fournier linked to an article published on the RFAngle, a site of conservative commentary that he founded.  Fournier’s claim is misleading. There’s a difference between losing vaccines and looking for them. Politico was the first news outlet to break the story that the Biden administration was trying to locate 20 million missing vaccines. After Biden was sworn in, Politico reported, his COVID-19 response team discovered that the distribution system established by the Trump administration failed to track the full route the vaccines traveled once they left the federal government’s storage spaces. As a result, there was a large gap between the number of vaccines that had been sent out by the federal government and the number that had actually been administered.   Politico’s reporting made clear that the Trump administration had set up the distribution infrastructure under which the 20 million missing doses had gone missing.  ""That’s a dilemma that predated the Biden team’s arrival,"" Politico noted.  The RFAngle article that Fournier linked to in his tweet is critical of Biden but does not directly claim that the Biden team lost the vaccines. ""Biden administration cannot find 20 million vaccine doses,"" reads the headline.  Daniel Baldwin, the author of the RFAngle article, told PolitiFact that he based his piece on the Politico report.  We reached out to Fournier and asked for evidence to back up his claim. In response to our email, Mark Chase at RFAngle responded with a link to the Politico article and a NY Post article that drew on Politico’s reporting. When PolitiFact pointed to the language in the Politico article that contradicts Fournier’s claim, Chase told us that RFAngle had corrected its piece to clarify that the loss of the doses predated the Biden administration.

Facebook post misleads on congressional health care, benefits
","Facebook users are recirculating an old post that accuses members of Congress of enjoying more luxurious employment benefits than their constituents do. ""Take a look at the congressional benefits,"" says the Oct. 10, 2019, Facebook post, which was shared thousands of times. ""Free health care, outrageous retirement packages, 67 paid holidays, three weeks paid vacation, unlimited paid sick days; now THAT’S welfare."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The post mirrors other claims PolitiFact has fact-checked about lawmaker salaries, which haven’t increased since 2009, and retirement benefits. We reached out to Demian Brady, director of research at the National Taxpayers Union, and Mark Strand, president of the Congressional Institute, to understand what benefits actually come with a seat in Congress. ""A lot of this stuff is an exaggeration,"" Strand said of the Facebook post. The Facebook post claims lawmakers get ""free health care,"" but Brady said their coverage would be better described as ""highly subsidized."" It’s not free. Members of Congress are eligible to get insurance through DC Health Link, the exchange marketplace for Washington, D.C., under the Affordable Care Act. The FAQ page on DC Health Link’s website lists ""members of Congress"" among its eligible recipients. The federal government kicks in 72% of the premium costs, Brady said. That lines up with what the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service wrote in a 2017 report.  ""They get subsidized just like every federal employee,"" Strand said, adding that members can also opt to get coverage through a spouse’s employer-based insurance if they prefer. For comparison, employers in the U.S. contributed, on average, roughly 71% of the premium for family coverage and roughly 83% of the premium for single coverage in 2020, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s annual survey of private and non-federal public employers. Whether congressional retirement benefits are ""outrageous,"" as the Facebook post claims, is a matter of opinion. But they are ""generous compared to the private sector,"" Brady said. Members of Congress — save for the few elected prior to 1984 — belong to a pension program known as the Federal Employees’ Retirement System. The program is available to every federal employee, not just lawmakers, as PolitiFact previously reported. And it augments other benefits available to seniors. ""They do pay Medicare, just like every other American,"" Strand said. ""They do pay into Social Security, and they do have this federal retirement."" The FERS program qualifies members for a pension after five years of service, with previous work as a federal employee counting toward the vesting period. Those lawmakers must contribute part of their congressional salary into the pension plan in order to be eligible for the benefit. To collect, the lawmaker must be age 62, or be at least age 50 with 20 years of federal service, or be any age with 25 years of service. The size of a lawmaker’s pension depends on several factors, including the length of their service. But Brady said the pension for eligible members pays two to three times more than pensions offered to similarly-salaried workers in the private sector. In the private sector, about 67% of workers have access to defined-benefit or defined-contribution retirement plans, and about 51% participate, according to the Congressional Research Service. The Facebook post claims that members of Congress get ""67 paid holidays, three weeks paid vacation, (and) unlimited paid sick days."" That’s misleading. The 2021 legislative calendar listed by House Majority Steny Hoyer, D-Md., includes only 10 federal holidays that all federal employees get off — not 67.  Defining vacation days, meanwhile, is tricky. Members of Congress split time between Washington and their homes states or districts, and they may still be working during recess periods, so time away from Washington shouldn’t be confused with vacation, Strand said. ""There is no provision for vacation days,"" Brady added. ""When Congress is not in session, members often work in their districts, but they make their own schedules."" As for sick days, members can take time off when they are sick or for other reasons.  As PolitiFact has reported, members who are absent from votes often enter statements in the Congressional Record to reflect how they would have voted if they had been present. (Since May and throughout the coronavirus pandemic, the House has used a proxy voting system that lets absent members authorize a colleague to cast their vote for them.) There’s no limit on sick days or time off for members, Brady said, noting that former Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois missed the better part of a year after suffering a stroke in 2012. ""Usually when people are running for president, they don’t show up for Congress at all, for months on end,"" Strand said. Private industry workers get an average of eight paid holidays, seven paid sick leave days and 11 paid vacation days per year after one year of work, according to a March 2020 Bureau of Labor Statistics report. A Facebook post said congressional benefits include ""free health care, outrageous retirement packages, 67 paid holidays, three weeks paid vacation, unlimited paid sick days."" The post gets more details wrong than right. Lawmakers can take absences when they are sick, and they do have generous pension plans. But they do not get free health care, and they do not take 67 paid holidays. There isn’t a provision governing their vacation days, either.

No proof that voting system in Michigan was designed to ‘create systemic fraud’
","Weeks after Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump to win the 2020 presidential election, meritless allegations of voter fraud persisted. One widely shared on Facebook came from on a website that has published false claims before. Dated Dec. 15, it features the headline ""Judge Releases Dominion Audit Report: System 'Designed' to 'Create Systemic Fraud',"" and goes on to say that the report ""covers the forensic audit of Dominion's machines in Michigan’s Antrim County.""  The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The report cited by the article was from a firm that provided analyses and affidavits for lawsuits brought by Trump allies, falsely alleging voter fraud and election irregularities. It was discredited by Michigan election officials and the former head of certification at the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, the federal agency that certified the voting system used in Antrim County. An official hand audit performed by a bipartisan group of election officials confirmed what Antrim County had already certified, that Trump had won the county, even as he lost Michigan to Biden. The Dec. 15 article about Antrim County, located northeast of Traverse City in northern Michigan, was posted on Neon Nettle, which has been identified as a fake news website by Columbia Journalism Review and the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. Scrutiny of Antrim County’s ballots arose from an error in the reporting of unofficial results on election night, which initially showed voters in the heavily Republican county casting more votes for Biden than for Trump. State and county officials say the reporting error, which was corrected soon after the election, was the result of human error by the Republican county clerk, before the election. But Trump allies seized on the error, and other alleged irregularities, in their fruitless quest for evidence of election rigging through equipment made by Dominion Voting Systems. The article we’re checking refers to a ""bombshell report"" on the Dominion machines used in Antrim County. The Dec. 13 document was signed by cybersecurity analyst Russell James Ramsland Jr. of Allied Security Operations Group.  ""We conclude that the Dominion Voting System is intentionally and purposefully designed with inherent errors to create systemic fraud and influence election results,"" reads the report, which was filed as part of a lawsuit challenging the election. In a declaration made under oath in response to the lawsuit, Michigan Bureau of Elections Director Jonathan Brater said the report ""makes a series of unsupported conclusions, ascribes motives of fraud and obfuscation to processes that are easily explained as routine election procedures or error corrections, and suggests without explanation that elements of election software not used in Michigan are somehow responsible for tabulation or reporting."" Ryan Macias, the former head of voting system testing and certification at the Election Assistance Commission, said, ""The majority of the findings are false and misleading due to the fact that the entities reviewing the system lack knowledge and expertise in election technology. A Dec. 17 hand audit of the Antrim County results done by a bipartisan group of election officials confirmed the previously certified outcome. In the hand count, Trump had 9,759, up 11 from the certified results; and Biden had 5,959, down one vote. The audit ""proved again that the disinformation campaign surrounding Antrim’s presidential election and its use of Dominion vote-tabulation machines was completely meritless,"" Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, said in a statement. ""Today’s full audit in Antrim County confirmed the truth and affirmed the facts: Dominion’s voting machines accurately tabulated the votes cast for president in Antrim County,"" Benson said.  An article widely shared on Facebook said an ""audit report"" found that a voting system used in Michigan in the 2020 presidential election was designed to ""create systemic fraud."" The firm that made the fraud allegation, about voting in one Michigan county, provided this and other analyses and affidavits for lawsuits brought by Trump allies, falsely alleging voter fraud and election irregularities.  Michigan’s election director stated under oath that the report ""ascribes motives of fraud and obfuscation to processes that are easily explained as routine election procedures or error corrections."" And an official hand audit of the county’s votes confirmed that Trump won the county, with only slight changes in the vote totals that had already been certified.

No, study didn't prove that masks have negative effects on 68% of children
","An Instagram post from the operator of a website selling supplements is a great example of how not to use data. The post says masks to reduce the spread of COVID have ""major negative impacts"" on 68% of children. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim’s source is a report out of Germany based on online submissions of childrens’ reactions to wearing masks. In the span of one week in October 2020, about 20,000 people had entered data on nearly 26,000 children. The tally is unsettling: ""Impairments caused by wearing the mask were reported by 68% of the parents. These included irritability (60%), headache (53%), difficulty concentrating (50%), less happiness (49%), reluctance to go to school/kindergarten (44%), malaise (42%) impaired learning (38%) and drowsiness or fatigue (37%)."" Now, let’s look at why that doesn’t mean nearly as much as it might seem at first blush. (Hat tip to Health Feedback for their work on this.) First, while the number of respondents is high, that says nothing about whether they are representative of the German population. Participation was based solely on personal preference. There’s evidence to suggest the group was heavily skewed toward people who were mask skeptics. The German research paper said that about 42% of respondents thought the German government had gone too far in its efforts to stop the spread of COVID, and another 31% said the policies were inappropriate or incomprehensible. But a random poll in August found that only 10% of the German public thought the government’s rules were over the top. A large majority — 77% — said stricter controls were needed. The other key flaw in the post is that it assumes all of the negative results — which themselves are subject to interpretation — were caused by the wearing of masks. There was no effort to standardize the description of the kids’ reactions, and no control group. Some of the children might have always been reluctant to go to kindergarten. Some of them might always have had trouble concentrating. Without standards on capturing data on how the children reacted, and without a matched group of children who didn’t wear masks, there’s no way to say that the masks caused the children’s reactions. The result is a jumble of numbers, not valid data. This Instagram post recycled a claim made in early January. The fact-checkers at Health Feedback debunked that one a few days later.

Yes, Biden’s inauguration was legitimate. No, this isn’t a movie
","A new conspiracy theory has blossomed among some people who believed that former President Donald Trump had an elaborate scheme to remain in office: that Biden’s inauguration was fake, and he isn’t the real president.  The theory started to gain traction online when the Jan. 20 ""storm"" disrupting Biden’s inauguration didn’t happen. It  points to a myriad of ill-perceived discrepancies for what a real inauguration and presidency should look like.  These claims fall short. Biden is the real president and his inauguration was legit. The day’s events were broadcast and live-streamed by several outlets including ABC, CNN, C-SPAN, Fox News, NBC and PBS.  The event was much smaller this year due to COVID-19 restrictions. But we know it happened because it was witnessed and documented by elected officials, former presidents, military members, reporters, photographers and performers.  Social media posts and videos spreading the theory were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We debunked a variety of claims that argue the inauguration didn’t happen and that Biden isn’t the legitimate president.  Some people on Facebook claimed that the White House’s official inauguration video was unlisted on YouTube because it had more dislikes than likes.  Indeed, the 34-minute video has many more dislikes than likes — currently 76,000 to 14,000 — but it is still up on the White House YouTube channel. Web archives show no record that the video was ever taken down. According to one viral video, Trump’s executive orders were available on the Office of the Federal Register website ""immediately,"" while there are still no sign of Biden’s. That’s false. Biden’s executive orders may not have been uploaded at the time the video was made, but the documents are published on the site now. The online register shows that it also took a few days for Trump’s orders to be published after they were signed. Some claim that the inauguration was staged because Biden’s granddaughters, who were standing behind him when he took the oath of office, suddenly disappeared in certain shots.  They didn’t. Biden’s granddaughters may not have been visible at certain points due to different camera angles, but they were present throughout the oath and did not move. They can also be seen standing behind Biden in photographs taken by Reuters and the Associated Press. Biden’s form of travel has nothing to do with the legitimacy of his presidency. Biden originally planned to travel to Washington by train from Delaware, but that plan changed when it was deemed too great a security risk. So he took a private jet, which was also a break from tradition.  Usually the outgoing administration provides a government plane to bring the president-elect to Washington for the inauguration. Trump, who refused to acknowledge Biden’s victory until early January, opted to not attend the inauguration, becoming the first outgoing president in more than a century to skip the event. We previously reached out to the White House, but couldn’t confirm whether the Trump administration offered to provide transportation to the Bidens. CNN reported that ""a source familiar with the matter"" said the government didn’t offer the Bidens a plane, but did not provide further details.  Some social media users have shared photos of Biden in the Oval Office and say they provide proof that it’s not the real presidential office but a movie set owned by Castle Rock Entertainment.  Film sets of the famous room exist, but there is no credible evidence that supports this. Biden made a public entrance into the White House on Jan. 20 and was photographed in the Oval Office shortly after. He has been seen in the White House several times in the days that have followed. Some point to a vehicle visible outside the window behind the Resolute Desk as Biden sits there, saying there is no parking lot in that location. But the Oval Office overlooks the South Lawn and has a private road and circular driveway, both places where the car could have been parked.  A conspiracy theory circulating on social media says that Biden’s inauguration was fake and that he isn’t the real president. The evidence is paltry. Biden was legally inaugurated as the 46th U.S. president on Jan. 20. We rate the claims Pants on Fire!

It's not clear what Biden said while signing document

The International Business Times based a news story on the clip and social media reaction to it, also claiming that Biden said ""I don’t know what I’m signing.’""  We found no evidence that that is what Biden said.

If members of Congress violated federal law, they would most likely be arrested by the FBI or a federal marshal, she added. Vladeck and Cohn said some National Guard members who provided security for Biden’s inauguration in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol were given arrest authority.

Marco Rubio falsely claims former leaders are prosecuted ‘only in the Third World’
","In a short video that appeared on Twitter, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., spoke out against the upcoming Senate impeachment trial for former president Donald Trump, comparing it to what one would see ""only in the Third World."" Trump is facing his second impeachment trial, this time on a charge of incitement of insurrection, after a mob of his supporters rioted at the U.S. Capitol Jan. 6. The Senate trial is scheduled to start the week of Feb. 8.  Rubio said that he’d tried everything he could to end the second impeachment trial. ""This is terrible for the country. It sets a terrible precedent,"" Rubio said. ""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders. You go through Latin America, virtually every immediate past president is under indictment or in jail."" Rubio’s comment met quick pushback on Twitter from people citing prosecutions in the U.S. and other countries. So PolitiFact decided to check his claim that habitual prosecutions of former leaders happen ""only in the Third World."" And we found several examples to prove he’s wrong. We asked Rubio’s press team for clarity on Rubio’s definition of ""Third World,"" but didn’t get a response. The term, considered by some to be outdated and offensive, has usually been used to describe developing nations in Asia, Africa and Latin America. There is a common theme among some of the former leaders who have been charged or convicted of crimes after leaving office: Generally, they’ve been accused of corruption. But plenty of these cases have taken place in some of the most economically developed countries, including South Korea, Israel, France and Italy. South Korea’s former president Park Geun-hye was impeached and eventually removed from office in 2017. She was convicted in 2018 of bribery and other crimes, and her 20-year prison sentence was upheld this year by the nation’s Supreme Court. Lee Myung-bak, Park’s predecessor as president, is also in prison. In 2018, he was convicted for corruption crimes that happened when he was a presidential candidate and after he took office in 2008. South Korea’s Supreme Court in October upheld a 17-year prison term for Lee. ""Almost all of South Korea’s former presidents, as well as many of its business tycoons, have been implicated in recurring corruption scandals. ​Four former presidents have been arrested on corruption charges since the 1990s, including Ms. Park and Mr. Lee,"" the New York Times reported in October 2020. In Israel, prosecutors have brought criminal charges against two prime ministers in recent years. Benjamin Netanyahu, who is both a current and former prime minister, is facing charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three corruption cases. Ehud Olmert, who served as Israel’s prime minister from 2006 to 2009, was convicted in 2014 of taking bribes while he was mayor of Jerusalem, and convicted in 2012 of breach of trust. In France, Nicolas Sarkozy who was president from 2007 to 2012, just went on trial on charges of corruption and influence-peddling. A verdict is expected in March. Jacques Chirac, president from 1995 to 2007, was convicted in 2011 of embezzling government money when he previously served as mayor of Paris. Chirac’s trial started two years after he left the presidency because courts had ruled he was immune from prosecution while president. In 2013 in Italy, Silvio Berlusconi was expelled from the Senate following a 2012 conviction for tax fraud. Berlusconi had served three terms as Italy’s prime minister, the last one ending in 2011.  Rubio’s claim ignores various prosecutions and convictions in the United States of former governors and members of Congress. The Center for Illinois Politics maintains a list of convicted governors from around the country, including Illinois’ own former Gov. Rod Blagojevich, a Democrat who was arrested in 2008 on corruption charges, impeached, removed from office, convicted and sentenced to 14 years in prison. He was freed after Trump commuted his sentence in 2020. In criticizing the Trump impeachment trial, Rubio mentioned Latin American leaders being jailed. But even a conviction in the Senate would not send Trump to jail. The Constitution limits the penalties to removal from office and disqualification from holding future office. Apart from the impeachment, Trump and his family are facing investigations in New York state over their real estate dealings. No charges have been filed. Rubio said, ""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders."" This is not true. Developed countries in Europe and Asia have also prosecuted their former leaders in recent years, mainly for corruption. Two former presidents of South Korea, for example, are currently in prison.

Texas congressman overstates job losses tied to ban on new drilling leases

Pssst... aren't you supposed to CREATE jobs?""  Biden’s move will have a disproportionate effect on states with large swaths of federal lands used for oil and gas activity. New Mexico, for instance, has 24 million acres of federal land, or about 32% of the state’s total land mass; Wyoming has 29 million federally owned acres, or about 47% of the state.  Texas, on the other hand, has very little federally-owned land — 3 million acres, or 2% of the state. Nearly half of that is managed by the U.S. National Park Service. As of 2019, about 185,000 acres were under lease for oil and gas production in Texas.  Although most of Texas’ oil and gas industry is based onshore, a sliver of the industry is actively drilling in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico. As of Jan. 22, there were 16 offshore rigs in the Gulf compared with 175 on Texas land, according to the Baker Hughes rig count. (In February last year, before the coronavirus pandemic dealt major blows to the global oil industry, about 20 rigs were deployed in the Gulf compared to around 400 onshore in Texas.)  With such a small fraction of the state’s industry likely impacted by Biden’s directive, is Brady correct when he says that 120,000 Texas jobs are at stake?  According to Brady’s aides, the number he cited is pulled from a study released last year by the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade and lobbyist group. The study estimated that a ban on new and existing leases would cost nearly 1 million jobs by 2022, with top production-states hit the hardest. While Texas would lose 120,000 jobs, New Mexico would lose 62,000 and Wyoming would lose 33,000, the study says.  But the Biden administration’s moratorium on federal land leasing halts only new leases from being issued. Brady’s tweet misses this distinction. He said that the ban on new leasing would cost Texas 120,000 jobs, while the study he cited totaled losses tied to banning both new and existing leases. The petroleum institute hasn’t released estimates of how many jobs will be impacted by Biden’s order. Another group, the Wyoming Energy Authority, released a study last month that determined a ban on new leasing alone would impact 58,700 jobs in the eight states that make up the majority of public land production, which does not include Texas. However, an American Petroleum Institute spokesperson said it's reasonable to expect the administration will expand the ban to include existing leases as well.  ""We view this as a first step toward a federal leasing ban that would impact all oil and gas development on federal lands and water,"" said spokesperson Bethany Aronhalt.  This expectation is based on numerous remarks the president has made on the issue. For instance, during a 2020 primary debate, Biden said ""no more drilling on federal lands. No more drilling, including offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period — ends."" And Aaronhalt highlighted how Biden's nominee for interior secretary, environmentalist and progressive Deb Haaland of New Mexico, has been unequivocal in her opposition to leasing federal lands and waters to the industry.  ""I am wholeheartedly against fracking and drilling on public lands,"" she told The Guardian in 2019. ""Public lands are a statement about who we are as Americans. The most pristine and beautiful places in our country should never belong to one person."" If Biden did ban all federal leasing — new and existing, onshore and offshore — does Texas stand to lose 120,000 jobs by 2022?  ""Most of the Texas impact is due to closing development of the Gulf of Mexico, of the offshore"" drilling, said Geoff Brand, Senior Economic Advisor at the American Petroleum Institute.  Drilling in the Gulf of Mexico supports about 300,000 jobs, according to a Bureau of Ocean Energy Management estimate. This figure represents both jobs created directly by industry — like offshore drilling, platform construction and platform staffing — and the jobs indirectly created by the industry, like service companies and other onshore support operations. In economic terms, the 300,000 figure represents jobs created by the industry’s direct, indirect and induced economic impacts.  That workforce is sourced primarily from Texas and Louisiana, each of which contribute about 150,000 workers to the offshore industry, Brand said. The projected 120,000 Texas jobs lost due to a possible ban on new and existing federal leases would impact roughly 80% of Texas’ offshore workforce.  This figure is so high, Brand said, because most jobs are created when the industry spends capital up-front on drilling new wells and constructing new platforms. A complete ban on new leasing or permits would grind that development to a halt.  ""If you stop drilling and expanding, then you’re just maintaining production platforms,"" Brand said. ""It's kind of like building a pipeline — you get most the jobs up front when you spend the capitol and build things. It’s when you spend the money that the jobs are created. ... If you're maintaining a platform, you're spending some operational money, but you're not really spending that much.""  The American Petroleum Institute’s study is based on the National Energy Modeling System, a model of domestic energy markets created by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The model bases employment numbers on the industry’s rate of spending. The harder it becomes for producers to obtain leases and permits, the less they’re spending on development, which, as a result, sheds jobs.   The methodology behind the institute’s analysis is unobjectionable, according to Karr Ingham, a petroleum economist with the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers.  ""If that activity is just stopped wholesale, what do you think's going to happen to those jobs?"" he said.  ""Even someone who's utterly opposed to energy production, offshore production, federal lands production, whatever the case may be, taking issue with the way they went about this (analysis) would be a difficult proposition. They started with a sound model and went through sound processes to end up with state-level impacts,"" Ingham said.  Although the industry will adjust to Biden’s directive by reallocating resources to drilling on non-federal lands and waters, those adjustments will be gradual and may not impact short-term economic projections.   Similarly, it will take time for jobs in the fossil fuel industry to be replaced by jobs created in new energy sectors. The administration has stressed the importance of green job creation as it shrinks the fossil fuel sector. Biden’s Build Back Better economic recovery plan pledges to ""create millions of good-paying union jobs"" by building a ""clean energy economy.""  But Ingham says it will take time before these new industries are replacing lost fossil fuel jobs on a one-to-one ratio.  ""If a job gets lost some time in the next 12 months, what are you going to replace that job with? Where are those folks going to go"" Ingham said. ""It's not like for every job you eliminate in the oil and gas sector, a green energy job springs up on the other side.""  Anticipating Biden’s move to ban leasing on federal lands and waters, Brady said that a permanent ban on new leasing will cost Texas 120,000 jobs.  Brady pulled that number from a report released last year by the American Petroleum Institute. However, the institute said that the 120,000 figure is based on a ban of both new and existing federal leases, which is more far-reaching than Biden’s actions so far. Brady’s comment ignores that distinction.   Otherwise, the 120,000 job losses projected by the institute’s analysis is accurate given that it was based on modeling from the federal National Energy Modeling System.  We rate this claim Half True. ",/factchecks/2021/jan/29/kevin-brady/texas-rep-misses-distinction-between-new-and-exist/

Joe Biden: Clean energy to provide 84% of new electric power this year
","In his rollout of major actions on climate change, President Joe Biden laid out his 2035 goal to see an electricity sector that puts zero carbon into the air. Biden emphasized that the change is underway. ""Already, 84% of all new electric capacity planned to come onto the electric grid this year is clean energy,"" Biden said Jan. 27. ""Why?  Because it’s affordable; because it’s clean; because, in many cases, it’s cheaper."" The part about 84% of new electricity capacity being clean energy stood out, and we dug into it. The latest government data backs him up. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the new electric capacity slated to come online in 2021, measured in total gigawatts, will be 39% solar, 31% wind, 11% from batteries, and 3% nuclear. That’s where Biden got his 84%. Do those sources really amount to ""clean"" energy? There’s a separate debate over nuclear power, because while it’s carbon-free, there’s the long term problem of nuclear waste. But that aside, there’s also room to question the inclusion of battery power, as the federal government does. ""Batteries probably shouldn’t be in the total,"" said energy economist Kenneth Gillingham with Yale University. ""They are not actually generating electricity. They are simply storing it for use at other times."" Gillingham underscored that the link between batteries and renewables is strong, because batteries are vital to building the market for solar and wind power. But today, he said, batteries could well be charged with fossil-fuel powered electricity. Taking batteries out of the total, at least 70% of the new electric power capacity is carbon-free, which isn’t too far from what Biden said. Still, while electricity from wind and solar has grown rapidly, it represents only about 10% of the national total. Fossil fuels power over 60% of the nation’s electricity supply.  A peek at the details of the latest government report shows a surge of new renewable power coming online in December 2021. The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, said that’s a result of federal investment tax credits. Those credits let  facility owners deduct a percentage of the project cost from their taxes. Until Congress changed the law at the end of 2020, that particular financial incentive was due to drop from 22% in 2021 to 10% in 2022. With millions of dollars in play, companies didn’t want to lose the 12-point difference and moved projects along as quickly as they could. The experts we reached said several factors led the country to see less new capacity fueled by natural gas, and more by renewables. On top of the tax credits, technology improvements, state and local level policies to boost renewable power and demand from utilities and industry combined to make renewables the leading option. The 2021 number is no outlier. There have been ups and downs, but over the past 10 years, renewables have averaged over 57% of new utility-scale electric capacity. Susan Tierney, senior adviser with the private consulting firm Analysis Group in Denver, said Biden’s statistic shows progress on the climate change front, but it also underscores how much remains to be done. ""It is clear that there will need to be continued, and accelerated, additions of renewables, storage, and other zero-carbon technologies in upcoming years, in order to decarbonize the electric system,"" Tierney said. ""The 84% increase is just one more year’s increment, and many multiples of that amount will be needed."" Biden said that 84% of new electric capacity scheduled to come online in 2021 was from clean energy. The number is credible, but it includes 11% from battery storage. Batteries are essential to the expansion of wind and solar power, but they are not necessarily ""clean"" energy sources; they could be charged with electricity produced from fossil fuels. Taking batteries out of the equation still leaves a total of about 70% from wind and solar. However, renewables remain a lesser slice of electricity supply. About 60% of the nation’s electric power comes from fossil fuels. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2021/jan/29/joe-biden/joe-biden-clean-energy-provide-84-new-electric-pow/

Post about Keystone pipeline falsely claims Buffett gave $58M to Biden campaign
","After President Joe Biden, on his first day in office, effectively halted construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, tens of thousands of Facebook users shared an image that claimed he was repaying a favor to billionaire investor Warren Buffett. The image includes a photo of a pipeline. The text above the photo, which misspells Buffett’s name, says: ""The Keystone pipeline. Cancelled by Biden on first day. Warren Buffet owns the railroad that is now transporting all that oil. Warren Buffet donated 58 million to Biden campaign.

The image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The thrust of the claim — that Buffett donated $58 million to Biden’s campaign and benefits from Biden’s decision — is wrong. Buffett didn’t make any contributions to Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign. The Keystone XL pipeline, first proposed more than a decade ago during a period of high oil prices, was to have carried up to 830,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with another leg stretching to Gulf Coast refineries.  The Trump administration backed the project in the face of objections from environmental groups. The company building it announced in March 2020 that it was launching construction, saying it would invest $8 billion in the project, with service expected to begin in 2023.  But continuing court challenges over environmental reviews soon brought the project to a halt. Only a 1.2-mile section had been completed before Biden on Jan. 20 signed an executive order revoking the pipeline’s construction permit, saying the pipeline would ""not be consistent with my administration’s economic and climate imperatives.""  Records from the Federal Election Commission and the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics show that Buffett, a donor to Barack Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaigns, did not contribute to Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign. It’s not clear where the $58 million figure in the claim originated.  All contributions to Biden’s campaign by employees of Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway, and its subsidiaries totaled $313,510, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. A Buffett spokeswoman has said that Buffett voted for Biden and that he does not have a position on how the pipeline might have affected BNSF Railway, a freight railroad network owned by Berkshire Hathaway that transports crude oil.  In the past few years, Buffett expressed support for the pipeline. An image shared on Facebook claims Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline because Buffett ""donated $58 million"" to his campaign.

Biden fracking policy still doesn’t amount to full ban
","An old campaign attack continues to dog President Joe Biden. A Jan. 25 post on Facebook juxtaposes two news articles: one from the Washington Post and one from Townhall, a conservative news site. The former article says Biden won’t ban fracking, while the latter says he ""followed through"" with a ban. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Throughout the 2020 presidential election, we fact-checked many claims that Biden would ban fracking, a process used to extract oil and gas from the ground. Several of them misrepresented his position, so we wanted to take a closer look at this post. (Screenshot from Facebook) We found that it, too, distorts Biden’s actions by making them appear more sweeping than they really are. In short, Biden is doing what he said he would do if elected — that is, ban new fracking on federal land. On his first day, Biden signed an executive order that put a hold on all oil and gas development in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. On Jan. 27, he signed an additional executive order that pauses new oil and gas leases on federal land, effectively banning new fracking there for as long as the policy lasts. His moves leave current fracking untouched. Let’s take a closer look at the Facebook post. The top of it shows the headline of a Washington Post fact-check published in early October. It debunked a Trump campaign ad that said, if elected president, Biden said he will end fracking. The headline: ""Trump campaign promotes false claim that Biden would end fracking."" The second article in the Facebook post purportedly shows ""what Biden is doing,"" and was published by Town Hall on Jan. 20. Its headline said: ""Biden Administration: Yes, We Are Following Through With a Fracking Ban."" The Townhall article covers an interaction at the first press briefing of the Biden administration. (The article more accurately explains the type of fracking that Biden promised to block.) On Jan. 20, White House press secretary Jen Psaki answered a reporter’s question about the executive order that Biden signed that day about Alaska oil and gas drilling. Here’s the exchange, in context: Reporter: ""President Biden promised to end all new oil and gas leasing on federal lands when he was a candidate. The order that you just mentioned that he signed today was much narrower than that — it's a temporary moratorium and it only applies to (the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge). And there is some debate about whether he has the legal flexibility to even follow through with his full promise. Does the administration still have that commitment today? Psaki: ""We do, and the leases will be reviewed by our team. We just have only been in office for less than a day now"" What Biden signed was an executive order that paused the federal government’s implementation of the Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The Trump-era program, passed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, directed the Interior Department to issue leases for drilling oil and natural gas in the refuge’s coastal plain. Biden’s order also reinstated an Obama-era policy that withdrew certain areas of the Arctic from consideration for oil drilling. ""The Secretary (of the Interior) shall review the program and, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, conduct a new, comprehensive analysis of the potential environmental impacts of the oil and gas program,"" Biden’s executive order says. Biden’s move tracked with his climate change plan, which calls for banning fracking on federal lands but not all fracking. RELATED: Biden Promise Tracker On Jan. 27 — after the Facebook post and Townhall article were published — Biden signed an additional executive order that directs the interior secretary to ""pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review."" It would effectively prevent new fracking projects on federal land. The Interior Department said the order ""does not impact existing operations or permits for valid, existing leases, which are continuing to be reviewed and approved."" Biden reiterated that point in remarks to the press. ""Let me be clear, and I know this always comes up: We're not going to ban fracking,"" he said. The Facebook post says Biden is ""following through with a fracking ban."" That’s not quite right. Biden has signed two executive orders related to land leases for oil and natural gas drilling. One order pauses new leases specifically in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, while the other pauses new leases on all federal land. Neither ban existing fracking operations, and Biden has said repeatedly that he does not intend to do so.

No proof Biden orders caused sudden corn, soybean price drops
","During his first 48 hours in office, President Joe Biden signed a record number of executive orders and has continued issuing more, with many aimed at fighting the coronavirus pandemic or reversing orders issued by President Donald Trump.

The post  is an image of a Jan. 23 tweet that was shared more than 30,000 times on Twitter and reads:  ""Soybean price is down 70 cents per bushel in the last two days. Corn is down 50 cents per bushel in two days. For those who don’t know, a small farmer like me working 1,000 acres just lost $100,000 on a 200 bushel per acre average corn crop thanks to Biden’s executive orders."" The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There has been a sudden drop in these commodity prices, though arguably less than what the post claims. But experts PolitiFact spoke to said they saw no evidence that any of Biden’s orders, which have the force of law, were the cause of the changes, given that prices have been running high.  It’s not clear which of Biden’s early orders the post might be blaming. A Jan. 22 order asks the Department of Agriculture to consider expanding and extending federal nutrition assistance programs. Looking at changes between Jan. 20 — the date of Biden’s inauguration and his first executive orders — to Jan. 23, the date of the tweet — soybean prices dropped 58 or 59 cents and corn prices 19 or 22 cents per bushel, depending on the contract, said Ben Brown, an agricultural and applied economics professor at the University of Missouri.  Brown said the abrupt declines were not surprising, because prices have recently exceeded $13 per bushel for soybeans and $5 per bushel for corn, as crop supplies have been tight.  ""Corn and soybean markets built strong gains in the markets over the last couple months with no major correction, leaving them vulnerable to last week’s action,"" he said. ""I find no evidence to suggest that Biden’s executive orders caused the dramatic decrease"" in prices, Brown said, noting that most of the orders ""were already known and any impact to commodity markets were built in."" Looking at price changes another way — between Jan. 21 and 22, the two days after the first executive orders — the declines were 79 or 84 cents on soybeans, depending on the contract, and 26 to 28 cents on corn, said Aaron Smith, professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of Tennessee. ""Markets are simultaneously digesting data from multiple sources, so attributing declines or increases to one event over a three-day period should be done cautiously,"" Smith said. Because corn and soybean prices have been rising since August, driven by strong export sales, global weather concerns and other factors, ""a short-term correction and price consolidation was overdue,"" he said.  Many factors led to the price declines during Biden’s first days in office, Smith said, including beneficial rainfall and weather forecasts in South America; COVID-19 concerns related to new strains of the virus and a slower than expected pace of vaccinations; selling based on profit taking; and the change in the presidential administration. A widely shared Facebook post showing a picture of a tweet claimed that soybeans dropped 70 cents and corn 50 cents per bushel in two days, causing farmers to lose big money, ""thanks to Biden’s executive orders.""

No, the Bidens didn’t invest their family fortune in Ukranian oil and gas
","Hunter Biden’s background in the Ukraine energy sector was a recurring target of critics during his father’s 2020 presidential campaign. And today, on social media at least, this son’s history in Ukraine has followed Joe Biden into the White House. ""Biden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture,"" said a Jan. 23 Facebook post with white text on a blue background.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns.) At root, the post claims that Biden has made a policy move to enrich himself. But the post spins a few unrelated bits of evidence into an inaccurate assertion. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Hunter Biden, who co-founded a business consulting firm, held a directorship for a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings, while his father was serving as vice president. In 2015, Viktor Shokin, Ukraine’s top prosecutor general, was in charge of investigating corruption associated with Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky. But several Western leaders, activists and institutions argued Shokin was not pursuing corruption aggressively enough. They were largely united in seeking Shokin’s removal. As vice president, Joe Biden urged Ukraine to fire Shokin, and threatened to withhold U.S. aid. But we’ve found no evidence to support the idea that Joe Biden advocated with his son's interests in mind. Biden’s position was that of the U.S. government and its allies. It’s not clear that the company would have benefited from Shokin’s ouster anyway, given evidence that investigations into Burisma had long been dormant. The episode became part of President Donald Trump’s first impeachment in 2019 after news reports surfaced about a phone call in which he pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, using U.S. military aid to Ukraine as leverage, to target the Bidens, which would have helped Trump’s reelection campaign. Trump was impeached, but the Senate did not sustain a conviction. On Jan. 20, Biden signed an order that revoked the permit for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. The Keystone XL pipeline is an international project years in the making. The 875-mile pipeline was intended to carry a heavy crude oil mixture from Western Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with another leg stretching to Gulf Coast refineries. Environmental groups have long opposed the pipeline, both on its merits and as a symbol of fossil fuel dependency.  Biden’s order revokes the permit that was granted March 29, 2019, by then-President Donald Trump on the grounds that it is harmful to the environment. Without support from the U.S. government, it’s effectively halted. Backers of expanded petroleum development expressed criticism of Biden’s decision, as well as other actions he’s taken that curb expansion of oil and gas drilling.  The blocking of Keystone XL fits with Biden’s focus on curbing the long-term use of fossil fuels as a way to reduce climate change. By law, presidential candidates need to file financial disclosure forms to give the public a sense of their holdings and, potentially, where conflicts of interest may lie. Biden filed such a form in 2020 covering himself and his wife Jill, and the form gives no indication that he’s invested in any specific Ukrainian oil or gas entity, much less that he’s gone all in with his fortune on such an investment. On the form, Biden reported income from the University of Pennsylvania as well as a corporation he used as a vehicle for funneling income he made from speeches and appearances. He also listed bank accounts and diversified mutual funds as assets. It’s also well known that Biden, throughout his adulthood, has funneled income into real estate. While the properties he owns are not listed on the disclosure form, a Jan. 20 article by Town & Country magazine cited two homes the family owns, one in Greenville, Del., and a second in Rehoboth Beach, Del. There is no evidence that any portion of Joe and Jill Biden’s assets are invested in Ukrainian gas and oil, much less that he canceled the pipeline in order to make his investments more valuable.

Walker overreaches claiming Senate can’t convict Trump after departure
","Former President Donald Trump is staring down his second impeachment trial in as many years, but uncertainty looms over the unprecedented proceedings. That’s because despite 245 years of history and 21 past impeachments by the U.S. House, the country has no direct precedent for an impeachment trial of a president who has left office. The House impeached Trump Jan. 13, 2021, for his role inciting the Capitol mob on Jan. 6. A trial is set to begin Feb. 8 in the U.S. Senate, but, of course, Trump has since departed the White House, having lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden. The resulting procedural question has given rise to an array of claims about what exactly the U.S. Constitution says on the matter, including one from former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. ""The U.S. Senate cannot convict a former President,"" the longtime Republican politician said in a Facebook post Jan. 26. He then repeated the sentence nine more times for emphasis. Walker also repeated the claim on Twitter, truncated to four repetitions due to the 280-character limit. But if 2020 taught us anything, it’s that saying something over and over on the internet doesn’t make it true. So let’s take a closer look. Despite the confident assertion from Walker — now president of Young America’s Foundation, which seeks to introduce young people to conservative values — this is far from a settled topic. The core Constitutional section here is Article II, Section 4, which says, ""The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" Article I specifies the two potential penalties in play are removal from office and disqualification from holding federal office in the future. Removal is obviously off the table at this point, but disqualification is a highly relevant consequence given Trump is said to be considering a 2024 run for president. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service dove deep into the precedent and constitutional interpretation in a Jan. 15 publication. They summarized their findings this way: ""The Constitution does not directly address whether Congress may impeach and try a former President for actions taken while in office,"" the six-page brief said. ""Though the text is open to debate, it appears that most scholars who closely examined the question have concluded that Congress has authority to extend the impeachment process to officials who are no longer in office."" Some key points the publication lists in support of a trial for a former president: In 1876, the Senate ruled a former secretary of war could face an impeachment trial for actions taken in office even though he had since resigned (more on this in a bit). The U.S. impeachment process was set up with the British system in mind, where former officials could be impeached. The framers made many ""highly specific decisions about the impeachment process that departed from the British practice"" but ""chose not to explicitly rule out impeachment after an official leaves office."" Many scholars have argued simple logic dictates impeachment remain an option. If impeachment didn’t extend to someone no longer in office, any official could elude punishment by simply committing offenses late enough in the term, or by resigning once the impeachment process began. And Congress could never bar an official from holding future office as long as that person resigns first. In the only discussion of the timing of impeachment at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, most members took it for granted that the President would be impeachable after he left office. Former President John Quincy Adams clearly interpreted this as a non-expiring penalty. While serving as a Congressman after leaving the White House in 1846, he told Congress, ""I hold myself, so long as I have the breath of life in my body, amenable to impeachment by this House for everything I did during the time I held any public office.""  Key points against a trial for a former president The plain text of the Constitution, that ""[t]he President, Vice President and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment ... and Conviction,"" could be read literally as only applying to officials who are holding office during impeachment proceedings. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story wrote in his influential Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States (1833) that impeachment doesn’t apply to officials who have left their position because removal is no longer necessary. Supporting his claim, Walker leaned on the literal interpretation argument. ""The (constitutional) language does not refer to a former President,"" Walker said in a statement to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Furthermore … the language clearly defines the judgement as ‘removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office’ and it does not separate the two issues. The judgement is both, not either or."" We’ll note this and/or argument falls flat, however, as it flies in the face of history. The Senate has convicted and removed eight officials, but it chose to ban only three of them from holding future office. If the two were inextricably tied as Walker suggests, all eight would have been banned. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is among those who have leaned on the logic argument. ""It makes no sense whatsoever that a president or an official could commit a heinous crime against our country and then defeat Congress’ impeachment powers … by simply resigning,"" Schumer, D-New  York, said on the Senate floor on Jan. 26. Mitt Romney, the only Republican senator to vote to convict Trump in his first impeachment, told CNN Jan. 24, ""I think it's pretty clear that the effort is constitutional"" based on legal opinions he has reviewed. That viewpoint conflicts with most other Republican senators. John Fortier, a specialist on Congress at the American Enterprise Institute, told PolitiFact National the problem is that ""the constitutional language is not specific either way."" He noted Schumer and Republican Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, both cited constitutional passages in arguing the two sides. Historical precedent is of particular importance when the Constitution doesn’t specify a course of action, and there is some in this case. The highest-profile suspension of an impeachment process involved President Richard Nixon. No Senate vote was taken because Nixon resigned after an impeachment vote from the House. The remaining possible penalty — a ban from holding federal office — didn’t apply since Nixon had already served two terms, making any Senate action moot. That also makes the situation a poor analogue for the pending Trump impeachment. An 1876 case provides clearer parallels, however. William Belknap, secretary of war under President Ulysses S. Grant, was brought up for impeachment by the House, but he hastily resigned hours before the House voted to impeach him. When the matter moved to the Senate, Belknap argued the Senate had no jurisdiction since by the time the impeachment vote came up he ""was, (and) ever since hath been, and now is, a private citizen."" The Senate disagreed. By a roll-call vote of 37-29, the Senate ruled Belknap was ""amenable to trial by impeachment for acts done as Secretary of War, notwithstanding his resignation of said office before he was impeached."" In the end Belknap was acquitted, with 22 of the senators who supported acquittal saying they did so on the grounds that his resignation barred impeachment. So the Senate conclusion was not unanimous or unambiguous, but it was passed and supported by the majority of the body. Applying Belknap to the present situation, there’s a case that the argument for trying Trump is even stronger than for Belknap, since Trump was impeached by the House while he was still in office, noted Brian Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University, who wrote a 2001 paper on the subject. But there’s an even simpler argument for this being constitutional: The current Senate said so. In a similar vote to that on Belknap’s objection, the Senate on Jan. 26 voted 55-45 to table an objection from Paul that a trial of a private citizen violates the Constitution.  Constitutional matters in this vein are traditionally left to the branches of government to interpret on their own, rather than relying on the courts, the Congressional Research Service says. It described the tradition this way: ""The Supreme Court has noted not only that ‘each branch of the Government must initially interpret the Constitution’ when performing their ‘assigned constitutional duties,’ but also that once one branch develops a construction of its own powers, that interpretation ‘is due great respect from the others.’ This principle of developing constitutional meaning outside of the courts is especially applicable in the context of impeachment, where the manner by which the House and Senate exercise their powers has been largely immune from judicial review."" Walker said on social media that ""The U.S. Senate cannot convict a former President."" There is constitutional ambiguity on this point. That’s something the Democrat-led Senate itself will decide as it steps into new historical territory considering the impeachment of a president after leaving office. But we know at this point in history it’s an overreach to claim this is a settled matter, as Walker does here. If anything, the needle is pointing in the other direction based on the preponderance of legal opinion, Senate precedent and the Jan. 26 vote. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/jan/28/scott-walker/walker-overreaches-claiming-senate-cant-convict-tr/
