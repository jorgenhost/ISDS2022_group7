Examining Black history of the Texas Senate
","The monuments and paintings of Confederate leaders that adorn the Texas Capitol became a subject of debate last year as Senate Republicans approved a bill that would have made it harder to remove or relocate historic monuments, including those memorializing Confederate figures. Those discussions resumed last month during a hearing of a Senate committee empaneled by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick charged with reviewing the history of the Confederate portraits in the Senate chamber. That committee, the Senate Chamber Review Committee, is composed of five Republicans and three Democrats, including the only two Black members of the Senate — Sens. Royce West, D-Dallas, and Borris Miles, D-Houston. As the hearing got underway, West took a moment to recognize what he believed was a milestone. ""I just want to make sure that I make a note that this is the first time in history, during my tenure as senator for the past 27 years, that two African Americans have ever served on the same committee,"" West said. ""I personally want to thank the lieutenant governor for making that happen, even though it is dealing with the issue of Confederate monuments."" ""I’m sure glad you noted that,"" responded Sen. Bryan Hughes, R-Mineola, who chairs the committee. ""Everything we do here is a part of history, and when something like that happens, we need to drive a stake in the ground and note it."" Black members first served in the Texas Senate during Reconstruction, when recently freed slaves won the right to vote and run for political office. During this era, three Black senators were elected to the Texas Senate between 1869 and 1882 — George Ruby, Matt Gaines and Walter Burton, according to the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. It wasn’t until Barbara Jordan’s election in 1966 that a Black member returned to the Senate. Jordan served for six years until she entered Congress in 1972. Eleven years later the Senate added its second Black member. Sen. Craig Washington, D-Houston, was elected in 1983 and served as the only Black senator until he was joined by Sen. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Dallas, in 1986. The two were appointed to the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services during the 70th legislative session in 1987, marking the first time two Black members served on the same committee since Reconstruction. Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, replaced Washington in 1990. He and Johnson served together until Johnson was elected to Congress in 1992, but were never appointed to the same committee.  West filled Johnson’s vacated seat in 1993, and there have been two African American senators ever since. But is it true that West has never served on a committee with another Black senator until this year? For 23 years West and Ellis served alongside each other in the 31-member body until Ellis resigned his seat in 2016 to successfully run for county commissioner in Harris County. According to the Legislative Reference Library, Ellis and West served together on the Senate Jurisprudence Committee as chair and vice chair during the 74th legislative session in 1995. During that same session, the two also served on the Senate Finance Committee. It wasn’t until the 77th legislative session in 2001 that Ellis and West again were assigned to the same committee — the Senate Committee on Jurisprudence, which West chaired. This was the last time West and Ellis served on a committee together. Ellis confirmed through a spokesperson that he and West had served on these committees together in 1995 and 2001.  After serving several terms in the Texas House, Miles replaced Ellis in 2017. The Senate Chamber Review Committee is the first time the two have been assigned to the same committee.  There have been several other instances where two or more Black lawmakers have served on a joint committee. For instance, in 1993 West and Ellis were appointed to the Select Committee on Historically Underutilized Businesses alongside state Rep. Harold Dutton Jr., D-Houston, and Rep. Yvonne Davis, D-Dallas. However, West’s spokesperson said that West was only referring to standing Senate committees when he made his statement last month.  West’s spokesman said he was speaking from memory. West’s office didn’t respond to several messages after PolitiFact noted the three instances in 1995 and 2001 two Black senators served on the same committee.  West said during a Senate committee meeting last month that Patrick made history this year when he appointed the Senate’s only two Black members to the Senate Chamber Review Committee. West said it’s the first time during his 27 years as senator ""that two African Americans have ever served on the same (Senate) committee."" However, it appears West was forgetting when he served on committees with Ellis in 1995 and 2001.  The first time two Black members of the Texas Senate served together on a standing committee since Reconstruction was in 1987.  We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097282600>],/factchecks/2020/dec/11/royce-west/examining-black-history-texas-senate/

Social media post falsely claims a federal law would require vaccination against COVID-19
","A Facebook post about Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine is filled with falsehoods. The Dec. 8 post alleges that infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, billionaire George Soros, and the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein are all connected to Moderna Inc. Moderna is a Massachusetts-based biotech company that’s developing a vaccine against COVID-19. But none of the alleged connections mentioned in the post are true. We rated that aspect of the claim Pants on Fire, when it surfaced in a separate post in August. The August and Dec. 8 posts also claim that ""if all goes ‘well’ it'll become federal law to get the vaccine."" Is that part true? No. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Moderna at the end of November said it would ask the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to grant emergency use authorization for its vaccine, based on Phase 3 study data indicating that the vaccine was 94.1% effective against COVID-19. The company itself has no authority to make its vaccine mandatory. The Trump administration has not said it would make any COVID-19 vaccine mandatory. President-elect Joe Biden has not said he would mandate it either. The federal government has invested more than $9 billion in vaccine deals with multiple private companies. The agreements vary in scope; some are only for the purchase of vaccines, others provide funding for the research, manufacturing and purchase of vaccines. But the messaging from the Trump administration so far has been about voluntary vaccination. A report from the U.S. Health and Human Services Department talks about ""ensuring that every American who wants to receive a COVID-19 vaccine can receive one."" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, was asked at a town hall in August if he’d support a nationwide mandate of a COVID-19 vaccine. ""No, definitely not,"" said Fauci, who has accepted an offer by the Biden administration to stay on in his director role and act as a White House medical adviser. ""You don't want to mandate and try and force anyone to take a vaccine. We’ve never done that. You can mandate certain groups of people, like health care workers, but for the general population you can’t. … We don't want to be mandating from the federal government to the general population. It would be unenforceable and not appropriate."" ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos asked Biden during an October town hall if he would mandate that people take a COVID-19 vaccine. Biden said it would depend, but offered that, ""I would think that we should be talking about — depending on the continuation of the spread of the virus, we should be thinking about making it mandatory."" He then noted that such a mandate would not be enforceable. Biden has since taken an unequivocal stance against requiring it. When a reporter asked Biden on Dec. 4 if a COVID-19 vaccine should be mandatory, Biden replied, ""No, I don't think it should be mandatory. I wouldn't demand it to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power, just like I don't think masks have to be made mandatory nationwide."" Biden said he’d do everything in his power as president of the United States to ""encourage people to do the right thing."" He takes office Jan. 20. A May 2019 report from the Congressional Research Service says that federal authority on vaccinations is limited. It is the states that have the general authority, within constitutional limits, to enact laws requiring vaccination. All 50 states and the District of Columbia, for example, have laws requiring certain vaccines for students, though such laws allow some exemptions. Based on the principles of federalism, the Supreme Court has interpreted the 10th Amendment as preventing the federal government from commandeering or requiring states to carry out federal duties. ""In the context of vaccination, this principle prevents Congress from requiring states or localities to pass mandatory vaccination laws,"" the report said. The federal government, however, could provide incentives to states to enact vaccination laws. A Facebook post about Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine said, ""if all goes ‘well’ it'll become federal law to get the vaccine."" Moderna has applied for emergency use authorization from the FDA for its vaccine against COVID-19. But neither the Trump administration or the incoming Biden administration has announced plans to make the vaccine mandatory, if the vaccine is authorized. There is no indication the federal government intends to mandate vaccination against COVID-19; in fact, leaders in both administrations have said they oppose it. Finally, states, not the federal government, have the general authority over vaccination laws. We rate the post False.

Biden did not ‘confirm’ or support an agenda to microchip Americans
","An old conspiracy theory about vaccines and microchips has resurfaced on Instagram. This time, President-elect Joe Biden is implicated. A Dec. 9 post shows a video of Biden in 2005, when he was a senator from Delaware. In the clip, Biden asks then-Supreme Court nominee John Roberts about how he’d rule on ""consequential decisions in the 21st century."" ""Can a microscopic tag be implanted in a person’s body to track his every movement?"" Biden asks. ""There’s actual discussion about that. You will rule on that, mark my words, before your tenure is over."" The account that posted the video, @endtime.signs, took Biden’s line of questioning as proof that the real goal behind the coronavirus vaccine is to implant Americans with microchips. ""This is the greater agenda, and he’s known it for years!"" the post’s caption says. ""The vaccine that we’re currently seeing is simply a stepping stone to the future chip that he mentions here."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.) The clip has more than 38,000 views. (Screenshot from Instagram) On Dec. 9, the U.S. set a record for the most COVID-19 deaths in a single day since the pandemic began. As federal regulators deliberate whether to issue emergency use authorization for a vaccine from Pfizer, anti-vaccine misinformation has proliferated on social media.  This Instagram post is the latest example of that misinformation — the coronavirus vaccine is not part of a plan to track people using microchips. The video shows Biden criticizing the idea of tracking people with microchips, not supporting it. Back in April, we saw a false claim that Democrats are pushing for everyone to get implanted with microchips via mandatory vaccinations. The notion appeared to stem from an incorrect interpretation of something Microsoft founder Bill Gates said in March about a system for at-home COVID-19 testing. This video clip of Biden questioning Roberts in 2005 doesn’t add any new or relevant information to the false premise. The video was taken out of the larger context of a hearing during which Biden argued that a liberal interpretation of the Constitution was needed to protect the rights of Americans — particularly their right to privacy. Here’s what he said to Roberts, in context: ""Judge, I do not believe in a Constitution where individuals could for very long have accomplished what we did had we read it in such a narrow way. Like the Founders, I believe our Constitution is as big and as grand and as great as its people. Our constitutional journey did not stop with women being barred from being lawyers, with 10-year-olds working in coal mines, or Black kids forced into different schools than white kids. Just because in the Constitution nowhere does it mention sex discrimination, child labor, segregation — it doesn't mention it. Our constitutional journey did not stop then, and it must not stop now, judge. And we’ll be faced with equally consequential decisions in the 21st century. Can a microscopic tag be implanted in a person’s body to track his every movement? There is actual discussion about that. You will rule on that, mark my words, before your tenure is over. Can brain scans be used to determine whether a person is inclined toward criminality or violent behavior? You will rule on that. And, judge, I need to know whether you will be a justice who believes that the constitutional journey must continue to speak to these consequential decisions, or that we have gone far enough in protecting against government intrusion into our autonomy, into the most personal decisions we make. Judge, that is why this is a critical moment."" The president-elect has not called for microchipping people who receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and there’s no evidence the vaccine is a ""stepping stone"" toward tracking people The Instagram post is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

"['Georgia', 'Campaign Finance', 'Jon Ossoff']","
Sen. David Perdue hasn’t held town halls, did offer access to campaign donors
","In a debate where he appeared alongside an empty lectern, Democrat Jon Ossoff attacked his absent Republican opponent, saying Georgia Sen. David Perdue hasn’t been accessible to his constituents and has sold his time for donations from political action committees. Perdue ""hasn't held a single public town hall meeting in six years,"" Ossoff declared Dec. 6. ""He openly sells access for corporate PAC checks. He sells four meetings a year and a retreat on a private island for a $7,500 corporate PAC check."" Perdue’s campaign manager has indicated the first-term senator won’t do any debates with Ossoff ahead of their Jan. 5 runoff election. Along with another Georgia runoff the same day, which pits Democrat Raphael Warnock against GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler, the race will determine which party controls the Senate. As for town halls, Perdue’s Senate office did not cite any that Perdue has held. Ossoff’s claim about donor access refers to a solicitation for a Perdue campaign fundraising event. That invitation shows political action committees that contributed $7,500 annually (not a single contribution) would qualify to attend quarterly events and an annual ""sea island retreat."" A town hall, as it’s typically understood, is a meeting that is publicized in advance and open to the public, in which the elected representative answers questions from members of the public that are not screened. Traditionally, these have been in-person events, but particularly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, more have been held online. We found no evidence that Perdue has held such a meeting, and his office didn’t offer any. Ossoff has been making the town halls claim about Perdue since at least August, and we found several media reports about Perdue not holding public forums. In May, the student-run Harvard Political Review reported that Perdue had not held any town halls since he took office in January 2015. Atlanta TV station WGCL reported in August about Perdue’s lack of accessibility to the public, and noted the Harvard story. In September, Atlanta TV station WXIA referred in a news report to a 2017 Perdue event that drew protesters. It didn’t describe the event, but said Perdue hasn’t held a town hall since then.  Perdue’s staff did not respond to those reporters for those stories. But in 2017, Perdue told reporters he had held ""impromptu"" town hall meetings while making an unannounced visit to the state Capitol, and that he prefers holding meetings with individuals or small groups. The nonprofit Town Hall Project told PolitiFact that Perdue has not held a public town hall since it began tracking town halls held by members of Congress in January 2017. The project uses staff and volunteer researchers to track lawmakers’ public schedules, subscribe to their newsletters, follow them on social media and visit their websites, said executive director Nathan Williams.  According to the Town Hall Project, a meeting is a town hall if it is open to the public and the press; announced with at least 24 hours’ notice; and has at least 30 minutes of open questions and answers; that is, the questions are not screened. Perdue's Senate office told PolitiFact that he regularly participates ""in public events and local visits to hear directly from"" constituents. The office did not cite any town hall event, either in person or online, but said Perdue has held ""constituent conference calls"" since taking office, including weekly calls during the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s not clear whether those calls were publicized in advance or whether constituents were allowed to ask Perdue questions that weren’t screened by staff. His office didn’t comment on those issues. To back the second part of Ossoff’s claim, his campaign cited a two-part tweet from Dave Levinthal, who was then an editor-at-large for the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics and is now a Washington correspondent for Business Insider.  The June 5, 2019, tweet showed images of an invitation to a Perdue fundraising event the same day that was hosted by Perdue Victory, a joint fundraising committee of Perdue’s campaign and One Georgia PAC, which is affiliated with Perdue.  The invitation solicited annual donations at three levels from individuals and political action committees for the Boardroom, an effort helping Perdue’s 2020 re-election run. At the top level, called ""Chairman,"" a PAC donating $7,500 per year or an individual donating $5,400 per year would be invited to an annual retreat at Sea Island, a private community on St. Simons Island in Georgia, including a reception at Perdue’s residence; ""invitations to special events throughout the year""; ""quarterly events""; and an ""end-of-year thank you."" Images of a fund-raising solicitation to support Sen. David Perdue's reelection campaign were posted on Twitter by journalist Dave Levinthal:
   The invitation did not say whether Perdue would be at all the events. Perdue’s office did not comment on the fundraising solicitation, and his campaign did not respond to requests for comment. WXIA-TV reported in February 2020 that on Feb. 13, 2019, Perdue attended a meeting of his Boardroom donors, and did not attend a Senate hearing held at the same time by two Armed Services subcommittees on substandard military housing at Georgia’s Fort Benning and other facilities nationwide. Perdue is a member of one of the subcommittees. Perdue’s office released a statement saying the senator ""has taken strong action to improve military housing at bases in Georgia,"" but didn’t address his scheduling on Feb. 13, 2019, according to the news report. Ossoff said Perdue ""hasn't held a single public town hall meeting in six years"" and ""sells four meetings a year and a retreat on a private island for a $7,500 corporate PAC check."" Perdue’s office said the senator has held weekly conference calls with constituents. But we found no evidence that Perdue has held a town hall — a meeting publicized in advance, open to the public and allowing the public to ask him unscreened questions — since he took office in January 2015. An invitation to a 2019 campaign fundraising event for Perdue offered political action committees that made an annual donation of $7,500 access to an annual retreat at Perdue’s residence in a private community on St. Simons Island, Ga., as well as access to  quarterly meetings and other events, though it was not clear whether Perdue himself would attend each event.

Trump said no candidate has won Florida and Ohio and lost. Pants on Fire!
","President Donald Trump added a factually inaccurate statement about past results in Florida and Ohio to the pile of false claims and wild theories about the 2020 election. ""No candidate has ever won both Florida and Ohio and lost. I won them both, by a lot!"" Trump tweeted Dec. 9. Trump did win Florida and Ohio on Nov. 3, but he flunked on his claim about history. In 1960 Republican Richard Nixon won both Florida and Ohio but lost the election to Democrat John F. Kennedy. Historians and journalists on Twitter quickly debunked Trump’s claim. On the same day as Trump’s tweet, a court filing on his behalf included similar wrong information about Florida and Ohio. Trump filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton that asks the U.S. Supreme Court to invalidate the electoral college votes for Biden from Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Election-law experts told us Paxton’s lawsuit is ""outlandish,"" a ""farce,"" and ""ridiculous."" Trump’s lawyer John Eastman wrote in the motion that Trump ""won both Florida and Ohio; no candidate in history — Republican or Democrat — has ever lost the election after winning both States."" Eastman, a law professor at Chapman University, floated the ridiculous theory last year that Kamala Harris, who was born in the U.S., may not be eligible to run for vice president because her parents were immigrants. The National Archives results for the 1960 Electoral College showed that Nixon won Florida’s 10 electoral votes and Ohio’s 25 electoral votes. Kennedy won the election with 303 electoral votes while Nixon got 219.  This year, Florida has 29 electoral votes while Ohio has 18.  We reached out to spokespersons for the Trump campaign and Eastman but did not hear back. The fact that any state has chosen the winner in the past isn’t a guarantee of repeating that in the future. ""Florida and Ohio have often gone with the winner, but ... so what? Political patterns hold, until they don't,"" tweeted Princeton historian Kevin Kruse. ""We used to say ‘As Maine goes, so goes the nation’ — until the 1936 election, when Maine voted Republican and only Vermont joined it. And we stopped saying that."" There are many ways to get to 270 electoral votes without Florida or Ohio, said David Greenberg, a professor of history and journalism at Rutgers University. ""Winning Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Georgia (along with NY, CA, and IL) is one!"" he told PolitiFact, referencing Biden’s 2020 state pickups. ""So, big deal."" PolitiFact is headquartered in Florida, so we couldn’t resist a look back at why Nixon won the Sunshine state in 1960. Gary Mormino, professor emeritus of history at the University of South Florida, said the biggest reason Nixon triumphed in Florida was a combination of blatant and latent anti-Catholicism, Mormino said. ""Many Floridians were convinced that JFK was incapable of acting without deference to or counsel from Pope John XXIII,"" Mormino told us. ""The South in general and Florida in particular maintained a long history of anti-Catholicism."" Trump tweeted ""no candidate has ever won both Florida and Ohio and lost."" Trump is wrong.

Ingraham wrongly claims ‘no science’ suggests restaurants spread COVID-19
","Fox News host Laura Ingraham downplayed the risk of contracting the coronavirus while dining at a restaurant, wrongly claiming restrictions on eating out are not supported by science. ""You know what the biggest lie is, is that restaurants are spreaders of COVID,"" Ingraham told host Sean Hannity during the handoff between their TV shows. ""There's no science for that."" The Dec. 8 comment came after Hannity made reference to Ingraham’s on-air interview the previous day with a Los Angeles restaurant owner. The owner, Angela Marsden, had posted a viral video criticizing county officials for suspending outdoor dining. Hannity later specified that he was talking about ""outside"" dining in California. But Ingraham’s claim about restaurants was far more sweeping — and more wrong. It’s inaccurate to say that ""there’s no science"" to show ""restaurants are spreaders of COVID."" ""There is a lot of information showing that restaurants are a high-risk environment,"" said Emily Landon, an epidemiologist and associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago. ""Anytime people congregate, there exist increased opportunities for transmission should someone be infected,"" added Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University. ""A restaurant is no different."" Fox News did not offer comment for this fact-check. The risks associated with dining out vary based on the safety precautions the restaurants take and the coronavirus situation in their geographic areas. Many restaurants have become safer over time, but case surges in many states make running into an infected person more likely. ""It’s hard to make universal claims because the pandemic is different in different parts of the country and even in different parts of the state,"" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. ""In some parts of the country, restaurants aren’t driving cases. In others, they have been identified in case investigations."" City data in Washington, D.C., for example, has shown restaurants and bars to be among the most common places for virus spread. Data in and around Los Angeles has been less clear. Still, there’s plenty of evidence that COVID-19 has and can spread at restaurants — and especially at those that let groups of people congregate indoors without masks. ""Modeling studies have indicated that restaurants are high-risk environments for COVID-19 transmission,"" said Jason McDonald, a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""In places like restaurants, people remove their masks to consume food and beverages, which increases the risk of transmission."" One CDC report in September, based on a survey of 314 symptomatic people who got tested for the coronavirus in July, found a link between testing positive for the coronavirus and going to locations with on-site eating and drinking options, such as restaurants.  The authors wrote that those with positive test results were ""approximately twice as likely to have reported dining at a restaurant"" than those who tested negative. In a November study published in Nature, researchers at Stanford University and Northwestern University analyzed anonymized cell phone mobility data from 10 U.S. cities from March to May.  Full-service restaurants, gyms and other crowded places accounted for a disproportionate share of COVID-19 infections, the study’s simulations showed. ""Restaurants were by far the riskiest places,"" Stanford’s Jure Leskovec, an author of the report, told reporters in November.  Patrons enjoy food and drink at The Brass Rail in Hoboken, N.J., on Nov. 11, 2020. (AP) Dining outdoors is safer than dining indoors, the CDC says, and restaurants with spaced out tables and limited guests are less risky than restaurants that aren’t keeping patrons apart. The virus is mostly spread from close physical contact, when people are exposed to respiratory droplets sent into the air as an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, laughs or breathes.  But there’s growing evidence that infections may have also come from tiny airborne particles, especially in ""enclosed spaces that had inadequate ventilation,"" the CDC says. Shaman cited one recent study from South Korean researchers that looked at airborne spread in a restaurant. The researchers examined the origins of one June cluster at a restaurant in the city of JeonJu. They found that, because of the way air was circulated in the restaurant, one person contracted the virus after just five minutes of exposure to an infected diner more than 20 feet away. Other studies have indicated indoor spaces carry higher risks of spread. The Atlantic highlighted one that showed the odds of transmission were nearly 20 times higher in closed spaces than in open-air environments. Landon shared with PolitiFact a powerpoint created for Illinois officials that listed several other studies, such as one examining an early outbreak on a cruise ship. Restaurants can reduce the chance of virus spread. Shaman recommended that they minimize or end indoor dining, limit tables and space them out, require waiters to wear gloves and masks, increase ventilation and keep surfaces clean. He also suggested that restaurants take down contact information for those who dine in case contact tracing needs to be performed.  Ingraham said, ""You know what the biggest lie is, is that restaurants are spreaders of COVID. There's no science for that."" In fact, plenty of evidence suggests restaurant dining has helped spread the coronavirus. Places that allow indoor dining and don’t follow safety protocols are considered especially unsafe. We rate Ingraham’s statement False.

She said the legislation is intended to require a homeowner to exhaust the potential of safely retreating into their habitation before using deadly force in defense of themselves or their property, and that she believes the current law ""emboldens people to people to take justice into their own hands.""  She continued, ""While theft is obviously wrong, we have laws to address that.

Fact-checking Facebook post comparing COVID-19 vaccine research to HIV, cancer, common cold
","It typically takes years to develop and approve vaccines, yet for COVID-19, first reported in late 2019, federal regulators are already reviewing vaccines that researchers say are more than 94% effective. The speed of the vaccines' development has some people on social media questioning their safety. ""So let me get this straight,"" says a Dec. 6 Facebook post. ""40 years of research, and no vaccine for HIV. At least 100 years of research and no vaccine for cancer. Ongoing research, and no vaccine for the common cold. Now in less than a year, there's a vaccine for COVID-19??? Nah I think I’ll pass on that shot!!!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The facts show that what accounts for the disparity is not undue haste with the COVID-19 vaccine, but rather important differences between the illnesses highlighted in the post, and a new approach to vaccine development. For example, there are many types of cancers, and only a few are known to be caused by viruses. ""So a universal vaccine to prevent ‘cancer’ is not something that is possible or pursued,"" said Jan Carette, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine. ""For specific viruses that cause specific forms of cancer, vaccines have been developed.""  The post also ignores unique medical challenges in creating vaccines against HIV and the common cold. The COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer that are up for review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are a type called ""mRNA."" Researchers have been studying this type of vaccine technology for decades. Most vaccines trigger an immune response by introducing weakened or inactivated versions of the disease-causing pathogen (such as a virus or bacterium) into the body. The mRNA vaccines, by contrast, use a genetic messenger to teach cells in the body how to make a protein — or even just a piece of a protein — to trigger an immune response. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more information on how COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work.) An mRNA vaccine has shorter manufacturing times and can be developed in labs using readily available materials. ""This means the process can be standardized and scaled up, making vaccine development faster than traditional methods,"" according to the CDC. Health officials have said that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are being held to the same rigorous safety and effectiveness standards as all other types of vaccines allowed in the United States. The Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed, an initiative to help speed up the development, manufacturing and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and other therapeutics, has also played a significant role in getting the vaccines to market. The federal government has made vaccine deals totaling more than $9 billion with multiple private companies. The deals vary in scope; some are only for the purchase of vaccines, other agreements provide funding for the research and manufacturing of vaccines. The CDC says there are seven types of coronaviruses that can infect people. One of them is the new virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. A study published in November by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill said that vaccines may be more effective on a current and common strain of SARS-CoV-2, compared with a previous strain of the virus. Common cold: Around 80% of common cold cases are caused by rhinoviruses — of which there are over 100 different types, many circulating at the same time, said Carette, the Stanford researcher. The common cold can also be caused by many different respiratory viruses, making it difficult for a single vaccine to target all varieties of the cold. The possibility of a vaccine composed of 50, 100 or more distinct human rhinovirus antigens ""has been viewed as formidable or impossible and has discouraged many vaccine makers,"" Carette said. HIV: A vaccine against the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, has proved especially challenging because the immune system responds to HIV differently from other viruses. While all viruses change, HIV mutates rapidly and has unique ways of evading the immune system. ""There are no documented cases of a person living with HIV developing an immune response that cleared the infection,"" says the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In clinical trials, inactivated HIV has not been effective at eliciting immune responses and, a live form of HIV is too dangerous to use, according to the institute. Research on an HIV vaccine has been going on since the 1980s. Cancer: There are vaccines available to help prevent human papillomavirus infections, and some strains of HPV have been linked to some cancers. Most cervical cancers are caused by infection with HPV, according to the American Cancer Society.  The American Cancer Society also says that people who have long-term infections with the hepatitis B virus are at higher risk for liver cancer, and getting a hepatitis B vaccine may lower some people’s risk of getting liver cancer. There are also vaccines to treat certain types of cancers; these vaccines are intended to work against cancer cells, not against something that causes cancer.  ""Sometimes a patient’s own immune cells are removed and exposed to these substances in the lab to create the vaccine,"" the cancer society says. ""Once the vaccine is ready, it’s injected into the body to increase the immune response against cancer cells."" A Facebook post claimed, ""40 years of research, and no vaccine for HIV. At least 100 years of research and no vaccine for cancer. Ongoing research and no vaccine for the common cold. Now in less than a year, there's a vaccine for COVID-19?"" The post questions the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines on that basis. Vaccines for COVID-19 were poised to be evaluated by regulators about a year after the virus was discovered. But the post goes too far in drawing conclusions about the vaccines’ safety based on how quickly they were developed compared with efforts to fight other illnesses. It ignores important differences in the development process, and characteristics of the illnesses that make them not directly comparable to COVID-19. Health officials have said that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are being held to the same rigorous safety and effectiveness standards as all other types of vaccines allowed in the United States.   The post contains elements of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.  We rate the post Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C15E800>],/factchecks/2020/dec/10/facebook-posts/fact-checking-facebook-post-comparing-covid-19-vac/

Trump wrong in multiple ways on Wisconsin absentee ballot applications
","President Donald Trump continued his evidence-free assault on the validity of the 2020 election during a Dec. 2, 2020, speech, taking aim at Wisconsin several times. One claim zeroed in on a favorite Trump target — absentee voting — to assert the paperwork behind those ballots was lacking. ""In Wisconsin, there are approximately 70,000 absentee ballots that do not have matching ballot applications as required by law,"" Trump said. The claim, included in a list of supposed election fraud examples, was made without any further detail or evidence. As with Trump’s many lawsuits seeking to overturn the election results in Wisconsin and elsewhere, this claim flies in the face of reality. Here’s why. For starters, Trump got the number wrong. Since the claim in this speech doesn’t provide much context, we reached out to Trump campaign spokeswoman Courtney Parella to explain the 70,000 figure. She declined to elaborate aside from referring to the campaign’s Wisconsin lawsuit. But that lawsuit makes clear Trump was attempting to refer to in-person absentee voting — that’s the only element of his Wisconsin claims related to ballot applications. One of the four primary allegations in the complaint was that ""at least 170,140 absentee ballots were improperly counted as they were issued without the elector having first submitted a written application."" That total is the number of in-person absentee votes cast in Milwaukee and Dane counties combined, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Those are the two heavily Democratic counties in which the Trump campaign paid for a recount and is now suing. So Trump meant to say 170,000, not 70,000. But that’s the least of his issues with the truth. Wisconsinites casting a traditional absentee vote do that by applying for a ballot by mail or through the MyVote.wi.gov website. But in-person absentee ballots simplify this down to a single form — an ""absentee ballot application/certification"" located on the envelope that holds the absentee ballot. Trump’s lawsuit — in line with verbiage from the speech — claims those in-person absentee ballots were filed without ""written application as expressly required by Wis. Stat. § 6.86(1)(ar)."" But that statute doesn’t include specific requirements. That reference in state law simply says municipal clerks shouldn’t issue an absentee ballot ""unless the clerk receives a written application therefor (sic) from a qualified elector of the municipality."" It details no requirements for what that application should include. Reid Magney, spokesman for the state elections commission, confirmed there are no requirements in state law on the nature of absentee ballot applications, leaving that detail to the commission to decide. And the commission has required an application for every ballot. ""To claim that there is no application on file for these absentee ballots is false,"" Magney said. The commission created the combined certificate and application in 2010 after complaints following the 2008 presidential election that in-person absentee voting was inefficient and involved too much paperwork.  The Government Accountability Board (predecessor to the elections commission) studied the matter and issued a lengthy report in December 2009. It created the combined form on the envelope of the absentee ballot after holding listening sessions and consulting with clerks around the state. A memo sent to clerks in May 2010 explained the change this way: ""The title of the certificate has changed to indicate that it also serves as an application for in-person absentee voters. A line has been added (""I further certify that I requested this ballot."") to make the document an application. This process — where early voters fill out an envelope application — has been used throughout Wisconsin (though not exclusively) since the 2016 election where Trump narrowly carried the state. We should also note this change was implemented at a time when Republicans controlled all of state government. It was a heavily-used approach in this year’s mid-pandemic election. Early in-person votes accounted for 23.7% of all ballots in Milwaukee County and 17.7% in Dane County, according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel analysis of voting data from the elections commission. Statewide, nearly 700,000 people voted this way in the November election. Trump claims in his speech (and a lawsuit) that ""70,000 absentee ballots that do not have matching ballot applications as required by law."" Every part of this is wrong. Trump was actually referring to a group of 170,000 votes, not 70,000. And that group of in-person absentee voters did indeed fill out an application in order to cast their ballot. It was part of the ballot certificate on the envelope, but that doesn’t make it any less valid since state statute doesn’t specify the nature of that application. It’s the same approach that’s been used without issue in Wisconsin elections since 2010 — including the 2016 presidential contest that Trump won. We rate Trump’s claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F73E00>],/factchecks/2020/dec/10/donald-trump/trump-wrong-multiple-ways-wisconsin-absentee-ballo/

No, Pfizer’s head of research didn’t say the COVID-19 vaccine will make women infertile
","As people start to receive Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, social media users continue to share misinformation about the injection.  ""Head of Pfizer Research: Covid vaccine is female sterilization,"" reads an inaccurate headline on a blog called ""Health and Money News."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  While the headline refers to sterilization, the post uses softer language, referring to the possibility of infertility caused by the COVID-19 vaccine. Even so, it draws a misleading conclusion from the claims made by the doctors it cites — claims that Pfizer and other experts dispute. The post claims the vaccine contains a spike protein called syncytin-1, ""vital for the formation of human placenta in women,"" that could be targeted by the body’s immune system.  ""If the vaccine works so that we form an immune response AGAINST the spike protein, we are also training the female body to attack syncytin-1, which could lead to infertility in women of an unspecified duration,"" the post says.  The blog cites ""ex-Pfizer head of respiratory research Dr. Michael Yeadon and the lung specialist and former head of the public health department Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg."" Wodarg is a German physician, and Yeadon hasn’t worked for Pfizer in nine years, according to the Associated Press. Yeadon’s LinkedIn profile says he was formerly the chief scientific officer of allergy and respiratory research. PolitiFact tried to reach him without success.  The post links to a Dec. 1 letter from the men to the European Medicines Agency seeking to stop clinical trials of the Pfizer vaccine in the European Union. ""Several vaccine candidates are expected to induce the formation of humoral antibodies against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2,"" the letter says. ""Syncytin-1… which is derived from human endogenous retroviruses … and is responsible for the development of a placenta in mammals and humans and is therefore an essential prerequisite for a successful pregnancy, is also found in homologous form in the spike proteins of SARS viruses. There is no indication whether antibodies against spike proteins of SARS viruses would also act like anti-Syncytin-1 antibodies. However, if this were to be the case, this would then prevent the formation of a placenta which would result in vaccinated women essentially becoming infertile."" Brent Stockwell, a professor studying disease networks and chemical and biological tools at Columbia University, told us that the claim that the COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility isn’t true.  Humans do have a protein called syncytin-1, which is critical in developing the placenta during pregnancy, Stockwell said in an email. ""Theoretically, an immune response against this protein could cause increased risk of a failed pregnancy."" But if the claims in the blog post were accurate, that would mean that pregnant women who catch COVID-19 would also become infertile, he said. No increased infertility or pregnancy loss has been observed in women with COVID-19.  ""Any hint of similarity between syncytin-1 and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (which is used as part of the vaccine) is extremely remote,"" he said. ""There are hardly any parts of the two proteins that are even vaguely similar, and they are far more distinct than would be needed for cross-reactivity of immune responses."" In short, he said there’s no chance that the COVID-19 vaccine would train the immune system to accidentally recognize and fight syncytin-1.  Pfizer told us in a statement that there’s no data to suggest that the company’s vaccine candidate causes infertility.  Experts interviewed by The Associated Press, which also looked into this post, corroborated this.  Our ruling The blog post says: ""Head of Pfizer research: Covid vaccine is female sterilization.""  The head of Pfizer research didn’t say this. A doctor whose LinkedIn profile says he worked at Pfizer nine years ago as a chief scientific officer has raised concerns that a COVID-19 vaccine could make women infertile if their immune systems target a certain protein. But experts say that even the rationale behind that idea is wrong. If a COVID-19 vaccine could cause infertility in the way the post describes, so would having COVID-19 itself, and there’s been no evidence for that so far.

Lawsuit claim that statistics prove fraud in Wisconsin, elsewhere is wildly illogical
","Nonsense dressed up in statistical jargon is still nonsense. And that’s what we find in the Texas attorney general’s unprecedented lawsuit asking the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn election results in Wisconsin, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. A claim gaining particular traction online purports to calculate the likelihood of those four states — all won by Democrat Joe Biden — shifting away from President Donald Trump, who lead earlier in the vote-counting process. ""The probability of former Vice President Biden winning the popular vote in the four Defendant States — Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — independently given President Trump’s early lead in those States as of 3 a.m. on November 4, 2020, is less than one in a quadrillion, or 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000,"" says the lawsuit, citing calculations by Charles J. Cicchetti. Claims about this 1 in a quadrillion chance spread widely on Facebook after the Dec. 8, 2020, lawsuit. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany repeated the claim that day, as did articles on various conservative websites. These stories were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). As proof, the lawsuit attached a ""declaration"" from Cicchetti presenting his justification for this claim, describing his hypothesis testing and calculation of Z-scores and p-values. But statistical calculations are only as good as the assumptions underpinning them, and Cicchetti’s are wildly wrong. Let’s take a closer look. Cicchetti’s analysis flops because he makes the same error in multiple ways — assuming any two large groups of voters should generate substantially similar results. Of course, we know this to be ridiculous. Groups can split drastically by geography. In Wisconsin, for example, Milwaukee County and Ozaukee County are next to each other, but one went 69% for Biden and the other 55% for Trump because demographics in the two counties are very different. And groups can split by voting method. Across the 20 states that report votes by party registration, when it came to in-person voting, Republicans led by a 42% to 36% margin in November’s election (with 22% listing no affiliation), while Democrats had a 48% to 27% edge in mail-in balloting (with 25% listing no affiliation), according to the U.S. Elections Project.  So a key part of understanding why early and late returns differ is looking at where those votes came from and how they were cast. This claim ignores that question altogether to treat each vote as if it were a coin flip. Kenneth Mayer, professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin Madison, said Cicchetti’s approach is ""ludicrous."" ""The analysis assumes that votes are all independently and randomly distributed,"" he said in an email. ""This is going to be used in undergraduate statistics classes as a canonical example of how not to do statistics."" The observed party split by voting method is key to understanding the absurdity of this claim. Cicchetti’s defense — in a description of his methodology attached to the lawsuit — focuses primarily on Georgia, noting Trump was leading 51% to 49% at 3 a.m. on Nov. 4 but wound up narrowly losing the state. ""The Georgia reversal in the outcome raises questions because the votes tabulated in the two time periods could not be random samples from the same population of votes cast,"" Cicchetti says. He’s so close to getting it right, but ends up so very wrong. The issue is indeed that votes from before and after that point can’t be random samples. But it’s not because of fraud as the lawsuit asserts — it’s because of which votes were counted when. In Georgia, the Secretary of State announced late morning Nov. 4 that about 200,000 absentee ballots had yet to be counted, most from DeKalb and Fulton counties around Atlanta. DeKalb ended up going 83% for Biden, and Fulton 73% for Biden, so of course adding in the votes from those areas moved the vote total in Biden’s direction. Cicchetti’s explanation says there was ""speculation"" that those last ballots counted were absentee ballots, but he wasn’t ""aware of any actual data supporting that."" That, of course, is ridiculous and false. The same thing played out in Wisconsin, where 170,000 absentee ballots in Milwaukee were among the last large blocks of votes reported. As we’ve noted in prior fact checks, this late swing toward Biden was anything but a surprise. Milwaukee is a longtime Democratic stronghold. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the city of Milwaukee 77%-18%. We knew well before the election that Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to vote absentee. Polling showed 81% of the people planning to vote absentee in Wisconsin supported Biden. We knew it was going to take a long time to count the absentee ballots, leading them to be reported later. In fact, each of the four states cited in the Texas lawsuit (and Cicchetti’s analysis) don’t allow absentee votes to be counted before Election Day.  This causes a bottleneck particularly in the biggest counties — which are, of course, centered around heavily Democratic cities. Those areas were long expected to be the last to report their results, and that’s just what happened with results from around Atlanta, Milwaukee, Detroit and Philadelphia. Cicchetti’s methodology doesn’t defend his ""one in a quadrillion"" number specifically for Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan aside from noting each state had between 69% and 89% of the vote tabulated before the latest reports. He says that leaves a large enough sample size of uncounted ballots that we should ""expect comparable percentages and vote margins"" before and after that point. Again, this ignores the indisputable fact that those were votes from dramatically different groups of voters. ""Cicchetti doesn’t even provide the relevant probability (in his methodology). He doesn’t consider obvious alternative explanations. And he makes a basic error in interpretation,"" Justin Grimmer, a Stanford University professor of political science, said on Twitter. ""I’m sure this claim will now become canon in election-conspiracy media, particularly given that Trump retweeted it. I’m frankly embarrassed that such statistical incompetence would appear in such a high profile venue."" Margins move throughout the counting process in every election since, as the Washington Post noted Dec. 9 in rebutting this claim, ""States aren’t homogeneous entities with one Democrat and one Republican in each square meter of space."" And they move in both directions. The lawsuit fails to note, for example, that Biden was ahead as the first 80% of ballots were counted in North Carolina, but ultimately lost the state to Trump because the outstanding votes were in heavily Republican areas. As a quick aside, we’ll note the lawsuit makes a similar claim of a ""less than one in a quadrillion"" chance that Biden would perform as he did in Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania given Democrat Hillary Clinton’s performance in those states in 2016. That’s equally ridiculous. We’ll let the Washington Post take it away on this one: It’s completely unclear where this number comes from. Particularly since Biden’s improvements over the 2016 Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, were fairly modest in those four states. Clinton lost to Trump by about 290,000 votes across the four states; Biden won them by about 270,000. That’s a swing of about a third of a percentage point relative to all of the votes cast in 2020. Yes, Biden got more votes than Clinton, averaging about 23 percent more votes across the four states. But Trump added an average of 16 percent more votes. A lawsuit seeking to overturn election results in Wisconsin, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania asserts the probability of Biden winning in each state is ""less than one in a quadrillion"" given the lead Trump had in each at 3 a.m. If ever a claim deserved the label of utter nonsense, this is it. What masquerades as a statistical analysis is actually a logical wasteland that ignores fundamental facts that make all the difference. The votes still uncounted when Trump had his short-lived lead were largely absentee ballots from major cities. Those cities have consistently voted Democratic historically, and mail-in votes within them should be expected to lean even more that direction since Trump had attacked that method of voting leading up to the election while Biden encouraged it.

No, the WHO didn’t change its lockdowns stance or ‘admit’ Trump was right
","On Monday, President Donald Trump claimed that the World Health Organization (WHO) ""admitted"" he was correct that using lockdowns to control the spread of COVID-19 was more damaging than the illness. In a post on Twitter, Trump wrote: ""The World Health Organization just admitted that I was right. Lockdowns are killing countries all over the world. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. Open up your states, Democrat governors. Open up New York. A long battle, but they finally did the right thing!"" He reiterated his statement later that night during a campaign rally, saying, ""But the World Health Organization, did you see what happened? They just came out a little while ago, and they admitted that Donald Trump was right. The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat-run states, where they’re locked out, sealed up. Suicide rates, drug rates, alcoholism, deaths by so many different forms. You can’t do that."" Together, the tweet and these comments got considerable attention on social media. But did the WHO change its stance on lockdowns or concede anything to Trump, as he said it did? Briefly, no. Since May,  Trump has been vocal about asking states to reopen businesses, schools, religious services and other social activities. He also took credit for locking down the U.S. in the early stages of the pandemic, however. And his administration largely delegated lockdown decisions to governors and local governments. Yet those lockdowns — marked by stay-at-home orders and other restrictions — have been less stringent than those implemented in other countries, said Brooke Nichols, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. The ""definition has differed country by country and state by state. I would argue that the U.S. has never had an actual enforced lockdown like there have been in some Asian countries and in Italy last spring,"" Nichols wrote in an email. We reached out to the Trump campaign and the White House to ask for more information about Trump’s assertion but didn’t receive a response. Although the Trump team didn’t get back to us, we noticed that the Trump War Room Twitter account responded to Trump’s tweet with a link to a video, appearing to back up the president’s claim. The video is a clip from an Oct. 8 interview with Dr. David Nabarro, a special envoy on COVID-19 for the WHO, by Scottish journalist Andrew Neil. The segment was televised by the British news outlet Spectator TV. In response to a question about the economic consequences of lockdowns, Nabarro said: ""We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control of this virus. The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup, rebalance your resources; protect your health workers who are exhausted. But by and large, we’d rather not do it."" Nabarro then went on to describe potential economic consequences, including effects on the tourism industry and farmers or the worsening of world poverty. We checked with Nabarro to find out if the clip accurately reflected the points he raised during a nearly 20-minute interview. He responded, by email: ""My comments were taken totally out of context. The WHO position is consistent."" That context Nabarro mentioned covered a range of topics, such as the estimate that about 90% of the world’s population is still vulnerable to COVID-19, that lockdowns are only an effective pandemic response in extreme circumstances and what Nabarro means when he talks about finding the ""middle path."" ""We’re saying we really do have to learn how to coexist with this virus in a way that doesn’t require constant closing down of economies, but at the same time in a way that is not associated with high levels of suffering and death,"" Nabarro said in the interview. To achieve that via the middle path approach, robust defenses against the virus must be put in place, said Nabarro, including having well-organized public health services, such as testing, contact tracing and isolation. It also involves communities adhering to public health guidelines such as wearing masks, physical distancing and practicing good hygiene. So, it’s really not accurate for the president to imply that the WHO has or has not supported lockdowns, said Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University. It’s not as simple as an either-or choice. ""No one is saying that lockdowns should never be used, just that they shouldn't be used as a primary or only method,"" Gostin wrote in an email. And Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, said both the WHO and public health experts have acknowledged there are economic consequences to lockdowns. (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.) ""Strict lockdowns are best used sparingly and in a time-limited fashion because they can cause negative health and economic consequences,"" said Michaud. ""That is why Nabarro said lockdowns are not recommended as the ‘primary’ control measure. Critics like to frame lockdowns as being recommended as the only measure, when in reality that is not the case."" And what about Trump’s assertion that the WHO had changed its position and admitted he was right? A member of the WHO media office told us in a statement, ""Our position on lockdowns and other severe movement restrictions has been consistent since the beginning. We recognize that they are costly to societies, economies and individuals, but may need to be used if COVID-19 transmission is out of control."" ""WHO has never advocated for national lockdowns as a primary means for controlling the virus. Dr. Nabarro was repeating our advice to governments to ‘do it all,’"" the spokesperson said. To test this premise, we looked at statements by WHO leaders over the course of the pandemic. In the multiple media briefings we reviewed from February onward, the WHO appeared consistent in its messaging about what lockdowns should be deployed for: to give governments time to respond to a high number of COVID-19 cases and get a reprieve for health care workers. Although WHO leaders in February supported the shutting down of the city of Wuhan, China, the presumed source of the COVID-19 outbreak, they have also acknowledged that lockdowns can have serious economic effects, and that robust testing, contact tracing and physical distancing are usually preferable to completely locking down. There is also no evidence the WHO ""admitted"" Trump was right about lockdowns. Trump tweeted on Monday and then said later that night at a campaign rally that the WHO admitted he was right about lockdowns. We found no evidence the WHO made this admission. And, based on a review of WHO communications, we found its messaging on the topic has been consistent since the pandemic’s early days. Trump also appears to have relied on a brief video clip of a wide-ranging interview with WHO special envoy Dr. David Nabarro that didn’t give an accurate portrayal of how Nabarro characterized the use of this intervention. We rate this statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096749940>],/factchecks/2020/oct/15/donald-trump/who-didnt-change-its-stance-lockdowns-didnt-admit-/

GOP group says Steve Bullock failed to act after aide was fired for sexual harassment
","The National Republican Senatorial Committee has produced an ad suggesting that Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democratic candidate for the Senate, ""failed to act"" after one of his aides was fired for sexual harassment.  ""We know Steve Bullock used his position to help his friends and family make money. But there’s a darker side,"" a narrator says. ""Bullock’s most senior political aide was caught sexually harassing women. Bullock knew about the harassment but said nothing, remaining silent when the aide took another job where he harassed women again. Steve Bullock covered for his friend at the expense of these women. Think about that.""  As the narrator speaks, the words ""failed to act"" flash on the screen. Bullock is running against first-term incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines in a toss-up race viewed as critical to determining whether Democrats or Republicans control the Senate. The Montana Senate race is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking.  The first claim of the ad, that Steve Bullock used his position to help his friends and family make money, was featured more prominently in another NRSC ad. Other fact-checking organizations have looked closely at the nepotism allegations against Bullock and found them false and baseless.  However, the majority of the ad is devoted to a claim that the NRSC hasn’t made before: that Bullock said nothing after his most senior political aide was caught sexually harassing women.  The NRSC’s claims revolve around Kevin O’Brien, a former aide to Bullock and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. O’Brien was fired from two organizations for sexual harassment: the Democratic Governors Association, which Bullock chaired, and the New York City mayor’s office.  However, the 30-second NRSC ad leaves out some important context. Here, we’ll break down the controversy over Bullock’s handling of Kevin O’Brien in detail and determine whether the claims in the NRSC’s attack ad are accurate.  O’Brien first went to work for Bullock, then Montana attorney general, in 2009. O’Brien served as campaign manager for Bullock’s gubernatorial campaign in 2012 and became deputy chief of staff to the governor in 2013.  In 2015, Bullock served a one-year term as chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, a political group that supports Democratic governors and candidates in their election campaigns. That year, O’Brien left the employ of the governor’s office and started work as a senior adviser for the Democratic Governors Association, serving as Bullock’s representative.  Ten months into his new job, O’Brien was accused of sexually harassing another employee at an after-work event. An internal investigation substantiated the employee’s allegations, and O’Brien was fired with Bullock’s approval. Bullock told the Billings Gazette that he made the decision to terminate O’Brien the moment he became aware of the allegations. In a statement to the New York Times, Bullock said that he ""fully agreed with the decision"" to fire O’Brien. A month after his termination, O’Brien secured a job as chief of staff in the New York City mayor’s office. A press secretary for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio told the New York Times that the city’s Department of Investigation at the time conducted a background check on O’Brien that included contacting both the Democratic Governors Association and the Montana Department of Administration, which handles personnel matters for the state. According to the press secretary, neither the governors association nor the state of Montana offered any ""adverse information"" about O’Brien’s employment history.  Amber Conger, director of communications for the Montana Department of Administration, told PolitiFact that the human resources division subjected O’Brien to an ""employment verification check"" when New York’s Department of Investigation called, providing basic information about his tenure at the Governor’s office, like the dates he was employed and his title.  ""No staff at (the Department of Administration) HR division had any knowledge of harassment issues involving Kevin O’Brien while he was employed by the state, or by any other employer,"" she wrote in an email.  Bullock has claimed that he didn’t know that O’Brien had applied for a job at the mayor’s office until after he was hired. In October 2017, almost two years after O’Brien was hired in de Blasio’s office, Bullock met with both de Blasio and O’Brien at Gracie Mansion, according to the New York Times’ review of de Blasio’s schedule. But Bullock said later he didn’t tell the mayor why O’Brien had been terminated.  O’Brien was forced to resign from his position at the mayor’s office less than six months later when an internal investigation found that he had sexually harassed two city employees. A year later, the New York Times published several stories on his ouster after it obtained documents of the investigation.  De Blasio criticized Bullock and the Democratic Governors Association, saying that he found it ""personally frustrating"" that neither had told his office about the previous harassment allegations.  In Feb. 2019 after the New York Times broke the story about O’Brien’s firing from the mayor’s office, Bullock apologized to Montanans in a Medium post. ""Should I have called Mayor de Blasio? Should I have let more people know? Was I naïve to think this wouldn’t happen again? The answer is yes,"" he wrote. ""I was wrong and naive to think I did enough. I should have done more to ensure future employers would learn of his behavior."" A campaign ad says Bullock ""failed to act"" when his ""most senior political aide was caught sexually harassing women. Bullock knew about the harassment but said nothing, remaining silent when the aide took another job where he harassed women again.""  It’s not accurate that Bullock didn’t act. O’Brien was working for the Democratic Governor’s Association when allegations of sexual harassment surfaced, ultimately leading to O’Brien’s termination. Bullock, who was chair of the association at the time, says that when he became aware of the allegations, he decided it was appropriate to terminate O’Brien. However, Bullock has conceded that he didn’t tell Bill de Blasio about the reasons for O’Brien’s termination when he became aware that the NYC mayor’s office had hired him. O’Brien was subsequently fired again for harassing two additional women.  The claim is partially accurate but leaves out some important details. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096953980>],/factchecks/2020/oct/15/national-republican-senatorial-committee/gop-group-says-steve-bullock-failed-act-after-aide/

No, it’s not true that all charges have been dropped against Kyle Rittenhouse
","Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old accused of killing two protesters and injuring a third in Kenosha, Wis., has become a cause celebre for gun-rights activists and others. Through online appeals, his lawyers have raised millions for Rittenhouse’s legal defense and released a video that positions him as a patriot who acted in self defense. But have they already won an acquittal on all charges, as a viral Facebook post claims? No. Far, far from it. Rittenhouse faces charges in Wisconsin based on the shootings, which occurred late Aug. 25, 2020 during civil unrest in Kenosha, which began after a Kenosha police officer shot Jacob Blake, 29, in the back, leaving Blake paralyzed. Rittenhouse is currently being held in Lake County, Ill., where he turned himself in to authorities after returning home to Antioch after the incident. Nevertheless, an Oct. 13, 2020, post on Facebook included this blaring headline: ""BREAKING NEWS: All Charges Dropped for Kyle Rittenhouse.""  The post included two images of Rittenhouse from that night, with these words: ""All charges dropped for Kyle Rittenhouse,"" and ""Lake County prosecutors announce they will not file charges against Kyle Rittenhouse.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). We reached out to the Facebook user who posted the claim but did not hear back. But this is an easy one to tackle: The claim all charges have been dropped is simply false. The confusion may stem from an announcement earlier on Oct. 13, 2020, in which prosecutors in Lake County, Ill., said they had found no basis to charge Rittenhouse under Illinois laws.  More specifically, an article posted that day on JSOnline.com, the website of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, noted the Illinois authorities said they had determined the AR-15 rifle in question had been purchased, stored and used in Wisconsin, and that Rittenhouse never possessed it in Illinois. Thus, he would not face gun-related charges there. But Rittenhouse still faces Wisconsin charges of first-degree intentional homicide in the killing of two protesters and attempted intentional homicide in the wounding of a third. He also faces a misdemeanor charge of underage firearm possession.  Those charges are on hold while Rittenhouse’s lawyers fight his extradition to Wisconsin. But they have not been dropped, or otherwise magically gone away. A Facebook post said:  ""All charges dropped for Kyle Rittenhouse.""  That is flatly and plainly wrong. The shootings happened in Wisconsin, not Illinois. The Wisconsin charges remain. Rittenhouse was never charged in Illinois, so when authorities said they found no basis to issue gun-possession charges, it didn’t change anything.

Fact-checking Jim Justice on West Virginia’s veteran population
","West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice recently told his Facebook followers that taking care of the state's veterans will remain near the top of his agenda if he’s reelected. Justice, who faces Democrat Ben Salango in his quest for a second term, wrote in the Sept. 14 post, ""West Virginia has one of the greatest percentages of veterans of any state, and I am absolutely committed to supporting them. In the next four years, it will remain a top priority for me as Governor to take care of our Veterans."" West Virginia has one of the greatest percentages of veterans of any state, and I am absolutely committed to supporting...   The question of how large West Virginia’s veteran population is has at times been tricky for politicians in the state to navigate.  In 2018, PolitiFact West Virginia fact-checked a statement by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., that West Virginia has ""more veterans per capita"" than any state. We rated that False, because 2016 data showed that West Virginia’s per capita veteran population ranked only 14th among the states. Justice’s reference to ""one of the greatest percentages"" leaves him a bit more wiggle room. We looked for the most recent data available to see if his phrasing was accurate. (His office did not respond to inquiries for this article.) We looked at data published by the Department of Veterans Affairs on the number of veterans in each state in 2018. We then used 2018 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau to determine how big a share veterans constituted in each state.  Here are the top 10 states for veterans as a percentage of population for 2018: 1. Alaska: 9.96% 2. Montana: 8.70% 3. Virginia: 8.69% 4. Maine: 8.61% 5. Wyoming: 8.54% 6. Hawaii: 8.32% 7. West Virginia: 7.98% 8. South Carolina: 7.97% 9. Oklahoma: 7.76% 10. Alabama: 7.64% We believe that ranking seventh out of 50 states qualifies as having one of the largest percentages of veterans in the country. Justice said, ""West Virginia has one of the greatest percentages of veterans in any state."" Justice phrased his statement carefully — and accurately.

How many opioid pills were shipped to West Virginia?
","The opioid epidemic has raged across the United States in recent years, but it has affected West Virginia more severely than most states. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, West Virginia ranked second only to Vermont in per capita overdose deaths from heroin and first in deaths from synthetic opioids. On Sept. 9, 2020, Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., sent a tweet marking House Energy and Commerce Committee approval of the Block, Report, And Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act of 2019, or H.R. 3878. McKinley is the bill’s chief sponsor.  The legislation, which has not yet been taken up by the full House, imposes added requirements for drug manufacturers and distributors that discover a suspicious order for controlled substances. In his tweet, McKinley said, ""NEWS: @HouseCommerce reported the Block, Report, And Suspend Shipments Act to the House floor. Nearly 800 million opioid pills were shipped to WV, amounting to 433 pills for every man, woman & child in the state. Our legislation will help prevent this from ever happening again."" NEWS:@HouseCommerce reported the Block, Report, And Suspend Shipments Act to the House floor. Nearly 800 million opioid pills were shipped to WV, amounting to 433 pills for every man, woman & child in the state, our legislation will help prevent this from ever happening again. pic.twitter.com/j8HEswo5xR   Those are stunning numbers. Is McKinley correct about 433 pills being shipped to the state for every West Virginia resident?  Basically, yes. McKinley’s language in the tweet mirrors that of a formal opioid response plan released by the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources in January 2018. ""Between 2007 and 2012,"" the report said, ""drug wholesalers shipped more than 780 million hydrocodone and oxycodone pills into the state. This amounted to 433 pain pills for every man, woman and child in West Virginia."" McKinley’s office also pointed us to a Pulitzer Prize-winning Charleston Gazette-Mail investigation published in 2016 that is the likely source of the statistics for the West Virginia state government report.  The newspaper, which is a PolitiFact West Virginia partner, based its figures on previously confidential drug shipping sales records that had been sent by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to the office of West Virginia’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey. The records disclose the number of pills sold to every pharmacy in the state and the drug companies' shipments to all 55 counties in West Virginia between 2007 and 2012, the newspaper reported. McKinley is essentially correct when he uses the ""nearly 800 million"" figure to refer to the ""more than 780 million"" pills that entered the state. This flood of opioids into the state led to 1,728 fatal overdoses over that period, according to a statement from a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing held on May 8, 2018. As for the 433 per person statistic, its accuracy depends on what snapshot of the state’s population you use. Since the time frame for the pill shipments stretched from 2007 to 2012, we used the 2010 census data to calculate the number of pills per person.  That year’s census counted 1,852,994 residents of West Virginia, meaning the number of pills per person, if you use the 780 million figure, was about 421. It is probably a little higher since the figure is ""nearly 800 million."" Broadly, it’s in the ballpark. McKinley said, ""Nearly 800 million opioid pills were shipped to WV, amounting to 433 pills for every man, woman, and child in the state."" A state report put the number of pills flowing into West Virginia at more than 780 million. Using 2010 census data, that works out to 421 pills for every resident of West Virginia.  It’s worth noting, however, that these hundreds of millions of pills flowed into the state over a six-year period, and that the last year included in the data was eight years ago.

Trump’s false claim that Biden is a socialist
","In bus tours across Florida, on social media and on TV airwaves, in English and in Spanish, President Donald Trump and his allies have portrayed Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris as socialists who will lead the United States toward a leftist extreme. ""Joe Biden is saying he owns the socialism and extremism in his party, that he owns it,"" Trump said in a Sept. 30 Minnesota rally. ""Socialism is the mainstream of the Biden campaign and it's not the mainstream of America. Remember I said, we will never have a socialist country,"" Trump said at an August rally in Arizona. Biden and Harris reject Trump’s socialism label. ""I beat the socialist,"" Biden said in a TV interview in Wisconsin, a reference to Democratic primary competitor Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who calls himself a democratic socialist. ""That’s how I got elected. That’s how I got the nomination. Do I look like a socialist? Look at my career — my whole career. I am not a socialist."" Republicans have used the socialist label to attack Democrats and their policies for decades, including over programs such as Medicare or Social Security that ultimately became popular on both sides of the aisle. We saw a ramping up of such attacks in 2018, especially in Florida. Socialism is a dirty word in the voter-rich battleground of South Florida, where many residents fled oppressive regimes in Cuba and Venezuela and literally argue about the socialism and communism label in the streets of Miami.  We wanted to cut through the noise and examine the facts.  The Trump campaign argues that Biden’s proposals to expand health care, offer free college tuition to some students and promote clean energy are evidence of socialist leanings. Experts say this characterization is wrong. ""Strictly speaking, socialism (like communism) refers to complete public ownership of all means of production,"" said Daniel Shaviro, an expert on taxation at New York University. ""Nothing in Biden’s platform is remotely in that territory."" Professor Ted Henken, an expert on Cuba at New York’s Baruch College, agreed.   ""Joe Biden’s long record in Congress shows him to be exactly what he claims, a moderate Democrat,"" Henken said. ""Harris is a bit more liberal or progressive, but far from being a socialist either."" The most narrow definition of socialism refers to complete government ownership of production.  When Sanders uses the term, he is referring to the generous social insurance programs available in some European countries, along with high tax rates, if needed, to pay for education, health care or other programs. That’s not what Biden’s platform calls for. Biden’s economic plan emphasizes job creation in manufacturing, infrastructure and health care, but he has not called for the government to take over those industries. Biden would reverse Trump’s tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations, and he supports a $15-an-hour national minimum wage. That doesn’t amount to socialism, either. While Harris signed on to Senate bills supporting Medicare for All, which would put the government in charge of paying for health care, it’s Biden who is at the top of the ticket. He proposes to improve the Affordable Care Act, rather than revamp the health care system. He supports allowing Americans the choice of a public option for government-backed health insurance, in addition to the private insurance options. Those eligible for Medicaid could enroll in the public option at reduced cost. Socialized medicine generally refers to a system in which the government pays all the bills, owns the health facilities and employs the health professionals who work there. The ACA, by contrast, has a large market component, allowing people to buy insurance on the marketplace from private insurance companies. (Trump supports litigation to undo the ACA.) Biden hasn’t embraced Medicare for All, but experts told us that Medicare for All as proposed doesn’t constitute socialism either. ""Medicare for All is a proposal that would make U.S. health care comparable to that in other countries with capitalist economies, with a primary role for government with regard to social welfare,"" said Martin Gaynor, Carnegie Mellon University professor of economics and public policy. ""I wouldn’t call that socialism."" After clinching the nomination, Biden shifted to the left on environmental, health care and racial justice issues, but his economic platform is still far from being socialist, Henken said. (Henken recently started volunteering for a Democratic Party hotline that answers voters’ questions about when and where to vote. It’s open to all voters, regardless of affiliation.) ""It is much more solidly in line with America’s tradition of Keynesian economics, where the government increases spending and keeps taxes low (for all but the very rich) to jump-start the private sector — which is understood to be the best motor for growth, innovation and job creation,"" Henken said. Antony Davies, a free-market economist at Duquesne University, said Biden’s proposals such as improving the ACA, reinstating environmental protections and investing tax dollars in infrastructure are not strictly speaking socialist. ""Some of the policies are heavily regulatory, in that they would have politicians and bureaucrats weigh in on what products Americans will have, but the policies do not call for the government to take ownership of housing, infrastructure, or to directly employ workers,"" he said. The real problem, Davies said, lies in thinking in binary terms: socialism vs. capitalism.  ""There is no example of a pure socialist or a pure capitalist economy. All economies are located on a continuum somewhere between the two extremes,"" he said. ""Many of Biden’s policies do move the United States further toward the socialist end of the continuum, in that the policies replace voluntary decision-making with coercive decision-making. But some, like some of his proposed environmental protections, actually move the United States further away from the socialist end of the continuum by reinforcing voluntary decision-making."" To back its claim that Biden is a socialist, the Trump campaign pointed to support for Biden from the chairman of the Revolutionary Communist Party USA, and the Working Families Party, as well as support from U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. (The Biden campaign noted that the Democratic Socialists of America declined to endorse him.) But those endorsements or support don’t necessarily mean they agree with Biden on ideology, or that Biden subscribes to their ideologies. It means they prefer Biden to Trump. Biden has also been endorsed by the Lincoln Project, a group of anti-Trump Republicans, as well as some Republican national security officials. But Biden is no Republican.  ""Trump recently received the endorsement of the Taliban,"" said Philip J. Williams, dean of the College of Liberal Arts at California Polytechnic State University and an expert on Latin American politics. ""Does that make him a Taliban?"" (The Trump campaign said it rejected that endorsement.) The Trump campaign also pointed to the Biden-Sanders unity platform document, developed by representatives of the two Democratic candidates in an effort to consolidate support after the primary contest. The document proposes expanding some social programs beyond what the United States currently provides, such as free-tuition at public colleges for students whose families earn less than $125,000 a year and more ambitious goals on renewable energy. But it does not propose a government takeover of private industry. It also omits some liberal wish-list programs such as Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. The Trump campaign also pointed to a New York Times article about Biden’s climate plan, which the campaign said would increase government control over the energy industry.  Biden’s energy plan isn’t socialism, Williams said. ""It does not call for a government takeover of the energy industry — instead it proposes various carrots and sticks to move the private energy industry in the direction of renewable energy,"" Williams said.  Trump sometimes tries to link the Democrats’ platform to socialism in Venezuela or communism in Cuba, seeking to capitalize on opposition to those regimes in Florida’s large emigre communities But Trump’s suggestion that Biden or the Democrats want to turn America into Cuba or Venezuela is ridiculous, Williams said. ""There is no evidence based on Biden’s proposed policies or his background that he is a socialist or even sympathetic to socialist policies,"" Williams said. Biden has called Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro a ""tyrant"" and has criticized the Cuban regime’s abusive record on human rights. Eduardo A. Gamarra, a political scientist at Florida International University, said that the Democrats’ agenda doesn’t call for creating a one-party state which has existed for decades in Cuba and Venezuela. The Democrats also don’t call for nationalizing key industries or private universities or creating a single media outlet as a government mouthpiece. RELATED: Scott's misleading attack on Biden about Castro, Maduro Trump says Biden is a socialist. Socialism refers to a government takeover of industry, and Biden has not called for that. Experts say his positions on health care, energy and other areas are those of a moderate Democrat, not a socialist. There’s no support for the claim that Biden wants the U.S. to be like Cuba or Venezuela.

Claim that there was mask requirement Wisconsin in May not true
","Masks have become the center of political debate in Wisconsin, with Republican lawmakers going after Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ mask order in court.  While some GOP lawmakers acknowledge mask-wearing can help in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus, they have generally opposed any mandate for them. That includes state Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield), who in an Oct. 11, 2020, appearance on WKOW’s Capital City Sunday show offered this argument: ""According to what the governor is saying, logic would tell us, if we are wearing masks, we should see a reduction in cases if we went into, you know, from no masks to a mask. Or, if we went from a mask mandate to no masks, the governor’s logic would mean that we should see a significant decrease in cases.  ""Well, we’ve actually had that test take place, because back in May, the Legislature did not implement the mask mandate after it went away. And if you look at the numbers, we went from masks, to no masks, and there’s no significant difference in cases."" We’ve looked at the science behind mask wearing, rating False a claim from a GOP Assembly member that wearing masks had been ""proven ineffective."" But in this case, it’s less a science question than a history lesson. Is Kapenga right that in May ""we went from masks, to no masks, and there (was) no significant difference in cases""? In a word: No. When asked for backup for the claim, Kapenga’s office said the senator was referring to the natural experiment that took place when the state was placed under lockdown and what happened once Evers’ stay-at-home order was lifted.  But that stay-at-home order, which began in March and ran until blocked by the Supreme Court in May, did not include a mask mandate. The governor’s mask mandate did not begin until Aug. 1, and remains in effect. Indeed, it’s the very thing Republicans are in court fighting now. On Oct. 12, 2020, St. Croix County Circuit Judge R. Michael Waterman denied a motion to suspend the mask mandate. That measure has been appealed. While we are looking here at the timeline claimed by Kapenga, it’s worth a brief look at his broader argument -- that, if the mandate were successful, it should have resulted in sudden and dramatically lower case counts. ""In the roughly ten and a half weeks since the first mask mandate was enacted, the average daily positive test rate and the daily positive case rate have risen faster than when the state had no mandate or lockdowns,"" Kapenga said in the email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.  But that suggests that the mask mandate is being strictly followed, when in many parts of the state it is being largely ignored -- including at campaign rallies for Trump. And it ignores the fact that case counts have stayed lower in Milwaukee County, where the City of Milwaukee instituted a mask ordinance weeks earlier. And that in other states, a drop in cases did follow the institution of mask orders. Kapenga claimed that in May, Wisconsin effectively had a test of mask effectiveness when ""we went from masks, to no masks, and there (was) no significant difference in cases."" But Kapenga has his orders and lawsuits wrong. What was lifted in May, under a Republican lawsuit that went to the state Supreme Court, was Evers’ stay-at-home order.  The governor’s mask mandate did not begin until Aug. 1, and remains in effect.  We rate this claim False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097185F80>],/factchecks/2020/oct/15/chris-kapanga/claim-there-was-mask-requirement-wisconsin-may-not/

Trump retweets Benghazi conspiracy theory that falsely claims Biden, Obama killed Navy SEALs
","President Donald Trump retweeted a baseless claim that former President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden killed a team of Navy SEALs and covered it up. The allegation has roots in a QAnon-supported conspiracy theory about the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya. The post Trump shared was an Oct. 12 tweet from a now-suspended Twitter account. The tweet shared a link to a story that claims a CIA whistleblower had exposed ""Biden’s alleged role"" in the deaths of a Navy SEAL team. ""Hiden Biden and Obama may have had Seal Team 6 killed!"" wrote the Twitter account, which was created in July. Trump amplified the claim in a retweet of the post Oct. 13. Some took that as confirmation. ""Potus confirms with a retweet the intel that current presidential candidate and former Vice President, Joe Biden, directly participated in a plot to have #SavelTeam6 MURDERED, then arranged a massive cash deal as part of a cover up,"" one account wrote on Parler, a website that has likened itself to a conservative version of Twitter.

Several readers messaged PolitiFact asking if the claims were true. (Screenshot from Facebook) Some of the posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  There is no evidence that Obama and Biden conspired to have a team of Navy SEALs killed. Multiple fact-checkers and media outlets have debunked the claim. But where did this conspiracy theory come from — and how do we know it’s false? We took a closer look. Trump’s retweet gave airtime to a new conspiracy theory about the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, the death of Osama bin Laden and a 2011 helicopter crash in Afghanistan. Its source is the unsubstantiated claims of a falconer. The article shared in the post that Trump retweeted was published by a conservative political website called DJHJ Media. The site is owned by David James Harris Jr., a Texas entrepreneur and Trump supporter. DJHJ Media’s article is based on an interview with Allan Harrow Parrot, whom the website says is a ""CIA whistleblower."" The video was tweeted Oct. 11 by Anna Khait, a former contestant on the reality TV show ""Survivor."" The video shows Parrot speaking virtually with Nick Noe, a conservative personality, and Charles Woods, the father of Tyrone Woods, a Navy SEAL who died in a 2012 attack on an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi. The attacks have been the subject of numerous false claims and conspiracy theories, as well as several congressional investigations.  The video was played at the American Priority Conference, an event held at Trump’s resort in Miami. In it, Parrot floated a new conspiracy theory related to Benghazi. Here’s a quick summary: Parrot claims that the Obama administration made a deal with Iran to stage the death of Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, in Pakistan. But Iran double-crossed the United States and swapped bin Laden for a body double, and Iran extorted billions from the Obama administration in exchange for keeping quiet. To cover its tracks about the raid, the administration ordered a Navy SEAL helicopter to be shot down. That’s a reference to a real event from 2011, when 15 members of SEAL Team Six died in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan. ""Vice President Biden paid with the blood of Seal Team 6,"" Parrot said in the video. ""He spent their blood like currency."" What does that conspiracy theory have to do with Benghazi? Later in the video, Noe says Benghazi was attacked to cover up the American origin of the missile used in the helicopter attack. Parrot, who was the subject of a 2010 documentary about international falconry, said he has ""terabytes of documents, video, audio"" that prove his theory is correct. We reached out to Parrot and Noe to see the evidence, but we haven’t heard back. Since the conspiracy theory took off on social media, the writer of the DJHJ Media article about Parrot has since distanced herself from some of his claims. ""For the record, anyone following my #SEALTeam6 articles, I have no proof that the Whistleblower's claim (sic) are true, but I am suspicious, of course, I am,"" she tweeted Oct. 13. The Obama administration did not order the deaths of the 15 SEAL Team Six members who died in 2011. They were killed by insurgents during an assault on a Taliban compound. On Aug. 6, 2011, 38 people — including 30 American troops, 15 of whom were SEAL Team Six operators — died after insurgents downed their helicopter during an operation in the Tangi Valley. The CH-47D Chinook military helicopter, operating with the call sign Extortion 17, crashed during an attempt to reinforce a Joint Special Operations Command unit. It was the deadliest day for American troops during the war in Afghanistan — and it came three months after other SEAL Team Six members carried out the raid that resulted in the death of bin Laden. Ed Darack, author of ""The Final Mission of Extortion 17,"" wrote in a 2015 piece for Air & Space magazine that the timeframe gave birth to numerous baseless conspiracy theories about the crash. In his 2017 book about the crash, Darack addressed theories specifically about the Obama administration’s alleged involvement. ""The most egregious media reportage transcended the merely ignorant and pushed into maliciousness,"" he wrote. ""This small number of theories, often politically motivated or at least tainted, suggested the absurd: that the Obama administration had the SEALs intentionally targeted."" RELATED: 7 ways to avoid misinformation about the election Darack wrote that, based on two military investigations — one conducted by U.S. Central Command and one by the Joint Combat Assessment Team — there is no evidence to back that allegation up. In the former report, known as the Colt Report, Army Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Colt led a team of investigators that inspected the helicopter wreckage, reviewed documents associated with the crash and interviewed eyewitnesses. He concluded that the helicopter ""was shot down with a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) fired by a Taliban fighter as the helicopter neared its landing zone."" ""The Colt Report correctly identified the sole cause of the downing: a lucky shot,"" Darack wrote in ""The Final Mission of Extortion 17."" What about the other two components of Parrot’s conspiracy theory: that the Obama administration paid Iran and coordinated the Benghazi attacks? Billions of dollars in Iranian assets were unfrozen following the Iran nuclear deal in 2015, but they weren’t a payout. In 2016, the Obama administration sent a $400 million pallet of cash to Iran as part of a resolution to a decades-long financial dispute over the sale of military parts. There’s no evidence the money was part of a plan to extort the U.S. The final report of the House Select Committee on Benghazi outlined how a mix of local extremist groups, including Ansar al-Sharia and several al-Qaeda-linked groups, were likely behind the attack that resulted in the death of J. Christopher Stevens, the American ambassador to Libya, and three other U.S. citizens. The investigation did not find evidence that the Obama administration somehow coordinated the attack. We reached out to the Biden campaign for a comment on the conspiracy theory that Trump shared, but we haven’t heard back. Claims that Obama and Biden ""directly participated in a plot"" to murder members of SEAL Team Six are wrong. The conspiracy theory hinges on one man’s unproven assertions about the 2012 Benghazi attacks, the death of bin Laden and the 2011 crash of the Extortion 17 helicopter in Afghanistan. There is no evidence to support those assertions. Two military investigations concluded that Extortion 17 crashed after a Taliban fighter shot a grenade at it. The investigations did not uncover a government plot to kill Navy SEALs. The statement is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire! Clarification Oct. 20: Anna Khait no longer contributes to the Epoch Times, the publication says. An earlier version of this story was unclear on that point.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096968340>],/factchecks/2020/oct/14/tweets/trump-retweets-benghazi-conspiracy-theory-falsely-/

Photo of Democratic senators huddling without masks is from 2018
","In the midst of Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Republican Sen. John Cornyn accused a group of Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee of failing to wear masks. Cornyn shared a photo on Oct. 14 that shows Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, Richard Blumenthal and Cory Booker huddled together. The caption asks, ""What’s missing in this photo?"" Cornyn’s quote-retweet then added, ""Masks?""  The original tweet was posted about nine hours before Cornyn retweeted it. Senate leaders have encouraged lawmakers to wear masks this year to combat the spread of COVID-19. But Cornyn’s suggestion that the senators’ masks are missing is misleading. The photo in the tweets wasn’t taken during the pandemic. A reverse-image search shows that the photo is authentic, but it was taken in September 2018 by Getty photographer Mark Wilson during Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings. The image caption in the Getty archive reads: ""Democratic senators Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (R-RI), Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Sen.

The original tweet was sent by Mary Ann Mendoza, a conservative activist who was abruptly pulled from speaking at the Republican National Convention after it was reported that she had shared an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory on social media.

Fact-checking Trump’s claim in Pa. that he’s ‘putting our great coal miners back to work'
","President Donald Trump returned to Pennsylvania on Tuesday for the first time since his COVID-19 hospitalization and told supporters at a rally in Johnstown that he’d revived the nation’s struggling coal mining industry.  ""We’re putting our great coal miners back to work,"" Trump said.  We wondered whether the president fulfilled a campaign promise he made four years ago to bring back coal.  He may have stopped the bleeding, but he hasn’t revived the industry.  Before the pandemic, there were about as many coal miners in the U.S. as there were when Trump took office, roughly 50,000. Stasis was a big improvement compared to the heavy losses the industry suffered under President Barack Obama, when the workforce shrunk by 40 percent. Still, the revival Trump promised never materialized. There are 6,400 fewer miners today than when he took office.    So, what happened?  One of Trump’s first executive orders ended a ban on coal mining on federal lands and scrapped Obama’s plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  ""Come on, fellas,"" Trump told the miners who had assembled for the signing ceremony in March 2017. ""Basically, you know what this is? You know what it says, right? You’re going back to work.""  The Trump administration rolled back a slew of environmental rules that had harmed the industry and tried to stop coal-fired power plants from closing. It even spent $1 billion in taxpayer money on coal, including the development of smaller coal plants that could be fired up more quickly than larger facilities to better meet the fluctuating needs of the electrical grid.  But coal production has declined 31% since Trump took office, and by some estimates, more than five dozen coal-fired power plants have closed.   ""The fall of coal is first and foremost a market story,"" University of Colorado economist Daniel Kaffine told The Guardian last month. ""The days of coal supplying the majority of U.S. electricity production are not coming back."" And while some coal is still needed to make steel, the practice of burning coal for energy is in a ""death spiral,"" he said.  Utilities continue to shun coal in favor of far less expensive natural gas, and there’s little Trump — or any president — can do about it.  Two dozen U.S. power companies, including Duke Energy Corp. and Southern Co., have pledged net-zero emissions by mid-century, and no new coal plants are planned for construction, according to E&E News. And because these changes require utilities to make sizable capital investments, they are not easy to reverse. ""Loosening environmental regulations hasn't really helped much, as switching away from coal is driven by market rather than regulatory factors,"" said Anna Mikulska, a fellow at Rice University's Center for Energy Studies. ""The cost of natural gas and renewable power has declined steadily, and coal cannot compete."" Coal once accounted for more than half of all U.S. electricity generation, but this year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects coal to account for just 18%, a smaller share than renewable energy sources for the first time.  Pennsylvania’s mining industry is hurting, too.  In April, Pittsburgh area mining giant Consol slowed production at its Enlow Fork mine in Washington County, citing low demand. And just over the border in West Virginia, Longview Power, the nation’s most efficient coal-fired power plant, filed for bankruptcy that same month, citing the pandemic.  Trump said he put coal miners back to work. He stabilized the industry after years of losses under Obama, but then the pandemic began, and the subsequent recession turbocharged the hobbled industry’s decline. The 6,400 job losses the mining industry has suffered in recent months tracks with utility companies’ waning demand for coal. We rate Trump’s statement Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BB4A80>],/factchecks/2020/oct/14/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-claim-pa-hes-putting-our-grea/

Checking ads that say Galloway’s campaign is being funded by groups seeking to defund the police
","Uniting Missouri, a political action committee in support of Gov. Mike Parson’s bid for reelection, has been running several attack ads against Nicole Galloway, who is looking to unseat him in the Nov. 3 election. The purpose of these ads is to connect Galloway to groups that want to defund the police and reinvest some funding into social services, an idea that has gained traction over the past few months in response to the police killings of several Black Americans during altercations. A Sept. 2 ad said: ""Galloway's campaign is being bankrolled by the same extremists who want to defund our police."" Another ad released that same day featured a woman named Le’Jon who talks about how crime has affected her family. She then goes on to make word-for-word the same claim as above. An Aug. 19 ad featured a police officer named Rob Dean who said that Galloway’s campaign ""has been funded by left-wing extremists who want to defund our police."" We wanted to see if that was true, so we looked through all of Galloway’s campaign finance reports since she announced her candidacy in August 2019. Every political campaign is required by law to submit quarterly reports of donations. They also have to do this before and after primary elections. After sorting through these reports, we found no contributions made by any group that expressly and openly supports defunding the police. Most of the donations were from individuals and labor unions. Her top donors were the Carpenters District Council of Greater St Louis & Vicinity with $69,300, Plumbers and Gasfitters Local 8 with $25,500 and United Automobile Aerospace & Agricultural Implement Workers of America with $20,000. When asked what pro-defunding police groups were bankrolling Galloway’s campaign, Uniting Missouri PAC communications director Mike Berg said that the group Indivisible has been urging voters to donate to Galloway. Indivisible is a national organization founded in response to President Donald Trump’s election in 2016. According to the group’s website, the group works to ""resist the GOP’s agenda, elect local champions, and fight for progressive policies."" The national website also urges their supporters to ""call on your own local and state officials and tell them to defund your local police department and invest those funds in resources people need in Black communities, Indigenous communities, and communities of color."" The Missouri chapter of Indivisible’s website urges voters to volunteer and donate to a number of Democratic candidates including Galloway. The St. Louis chapter has also posted links on Facebook to donate to Galloway’s campaign. Nowhere in Galloway’s campaign finance reports are any contributions made in Indivisible’s name. The Missouri GOP also released a statement Tuesday that said ""her campaign is taking money from groups like Planned Parenthood, NARAL, Indivisible and the Sunrise Movement that are pushing defund the police policies."" Although it is none of their primary missions, these groups have all shown support for efforts to defund the police. Planned Parenthood, NARAL and Indivisible have all publicly voiced support for Galloway, but we found no donations made in any of these groups’ names. Kevin Donohoe, a spokesperson for Galloway’s campaign, said he was unaware of any evidence supporting the ad’s claim. He pointed to numerous occasions where Galloway has said that she does not support defunding the police. We found one such occasion reported as early as July 2.  Uniting Missouri PAC’s ad claims that ""Galloway’s campaign is being bankrolled by the same extremists who want to defund our police."" At least one group, Indivisible, has been encouraging people to donate to Galloway’s campaign. However, to say the group is ""bankrolling"" her campaign when it hasn't directly contributed any money is wrong.

Kelly’s claim that McSally voted to take money from Arizona military base needs context
","Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Mark Kelly told Arizonans that while border security is important for their state, his opponent was going about it the wrong way. Seeking to unseat Republican Sen. Martha McSally, Kelly said that McSally supports a border wall that is too costly and a ""17th century solution"" for border security. The federal government should invest in technology and more border patrol agents — and not take money away from a military base in Arizona, he said. ""Senator McSally voted to take away money from Fort Huachuca to pay for the border wall,"" Kelly said during a debate with McSally in Phoenix Oct. 6. Is that true? McSally’s votes in 2019 allowed a national emergency declared by President Donald Trump to continue. The resolutions she voted on did not explicitly ask whether to divert money from Fort Huachuca to construction of a border wall; but allowing Trump’s declaration to persist did have that effect. Funding for the Arizona project was deferred, not scrapped entirely. Citing an ""invasion"" crisis, Trump in February 2019 declared a national emergency at the southwest border, a move that led his administration to redirect funds from planned Defense Department projects to construction at the border. ""Because of the gravity of the current emergency situation, it is necessary for the Armed Forces to provide additional support to address the crisis,"" Trump’s declaration said. Trump’s declaration came after he was unable to get money from Congress to pay for his promised border wall. Many immigration experts and lawmakers questioned the existence of the crisis Trump cited.. In September 2019, the Defense Department released the list of projects it would delay to provide $3.6 billion for border barriers. The list included a $30 million project for an equipment storage building at Fort Huachuca, an Army installation in Arizona. The Defense Department said at the time that the projects were being deferred, not canceled, and that the $3.6 billion came from ""unobligated"" funds, meaning that the money for the military projects had not yet been committed in contracts. A contract for the Arizona project was expected to be awarded May 2020. Congress would need to backfill the money being diverted, the Defense Department said. Kelly’s campaign pointed to three votes McSally cast in 2019 supporting Trump’s declaration. McSally in March voted against a resolution seeking to end Trump’s national emergency declaration. In September, she voted against another similar resolution. In October, McSally voted against overriding a Trump veto of a resolution to end his declaration. McSally’s September and October votes were cast after the Defense Department publicly released the list of projects that would be sidelined, including the one at Fort Huachuca. The resolutions that McSally voted against were specific to Trump’s declaration and did not include a direct reference to the delayed Defense Department projects. However, the deferral of the projects was directly tied to Trump’s declaration. McSally in March 2019 sent a letter to the acting defense secretary, asking that military construction projects in Arizona not be delayed due to shifts in funding for the border projects. ""While I strongly agree we must be tough on border security to protect Americans from drugs and criminals flowing across our southern border, we cannot forsake one duty for another,"" McSally wrote. McSally said that Arizona military construction funding ""authorized and appropriated in recent years will enable the service members working in critical missions to have a safe, efficient, and effective working environment. Without funding for these projects on schedule and on budget, we risk disruption or degradation of several important military missions."" In September 2019, after the Defense Department included the Fort Huachuca project in its deferred list, McSally said that funding for the Arizona project was already delayed anyway, ""because of ongoing environmental cleanup that is taking longer than expected."" ""The fact of the matter is that had the Army completed this sooner, the project would not have been delayed and would not have even been up for discussion,"" McSally said Sept. 4, 2019. McSally said she got a commitment from the Army that the project would be completed ""in a timely manner."" McSally’s campaign told PolitiFact that the Army in April 2020 notified her that the Arizona project site had been cleared and that a contract would be awarded at the end of December 2020. Her campaign said the Pentagon had ""reshuffled money around to backfill the money."" The Arizona Republic in April reported that the Trump administration restored money for the Arizona project by taking money from the Pentagon’s budget for operations in Europe and the Middle East. ""The money maneuvers are necessary as part of the military budget is redirected to pay for construction of President Donald Trump’s long-promised border wall,"" said the Arizona Republic article. Kelly said McSally ""voted to take away money from Fort Huachuca to pay for the border wall."" This needs context. McSally voted against resolutions that sought to end Trump’s national emergency declaration. Trump’s declaration paved the way for the Defense Department to identify military projects that would be deferred — including a $30 million project at Fort Huachuca — in order to free up money for construction of barriers at the southwest border. McSally in early 2019 asked the Defense Department to not delay funding for Arizona projects in order to pay for the border barriers. Later that year, she said the Fort Huachuca project was delayed anyway due to environmental cleanup issues at the site. Kelly’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

Tommy Tuberville wrong twice in attack on Alabama Sen. Doug Jones on abortion
","In a campaign ad for Alabama Republican Tommy Tuberville, a woman speaks into the camera to attack Democratic Sen. Doug Jones over abortion. The self-described ""proud pro-life mother of two"" says she regrets getting an abortion after an unexpected pregnancy at age 18.  ""I asked God for forgiveness, and Doug Jones should do the same,"" she adds. ""Jones has voted to spend our tax dollars on late-term abortions. He’s so extreme, he supports abortion up until birth."" Both parts of the attack are wrong.  Tuberville is a former college football coach making his first run for public office. Jones, an attorney, won his Senate seat in December 2017 in a high-profile special election against Republican Roy Moore, after Republican Jeff Sessions vacated the seat to become President Donald Trump’s first attorney general. The outcome of the Alabama contest could help determine whether Republicans keep a majority in the Senate, where they now control 53 seats. The race is rated as ""lean Republican"" by the Cook Political Report — meaning the race is competitive but the GOP has an advantage. It is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests that PolitiFact is tracking this fall. In the ad, Tuberville offers no evidence for his claim that Jones voted to spend tax dollars on late-term abortions. In an email to PolitiFact, his campaign, he cited a January 2019 vote by Jones on a bill tightening restrictions on funding and health insurance coverage for abortion. The bill would have imposed permanent and stricter limits on federal funding of abortions, and barred coverage for abortion in health insurance plans that meet the standards of the Affordable Care Act.  Jones voted no on a motion to proceed with the bill. In a 48-47 party-line vote, the motion fell far short of the 60 needed to advance.  Jones opposed the bill because it ""went further than the Hyde Amendment,"" Jones campaign spokesman Owen Kilmer said. It ""would have prohibited individual states from allowing citizens to have access to certain insurance plans that would have covered abortion procedures consistent with that state’s law."" The Hyde Amendment, routinely attached by Congress to health funding bills, prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest, or if the pregnancy is determined to endanger the woman’s life. (Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden now says he wants to get rid of the Hyde Amendment.) Jones’ campaign said he supports the Hyde Amendment in its current form and has never voted to spend tax dollars on late-term abortions. Jones’ no vote on the motion was not a vote to spend federal money on abortions.  The phrase Tuberville’s ad invoked, ""late-term abortion"" is not a medical, scientific or legal term. Like ""abortion up until birth,"" it is often invoked by abortion opponents to refer to pregnancies terminated after about 20 weeks’ gestation. Such abortions are rare, and subject to restrictions in most states. In the 2017 Alabama Senate special election, Moore’s wife, Kayla, made a similar attack against Jones, claiming he supported ""full-term abortion."" We rated it False, noting that she had apparently coined the term herself.  At the time, Jones said he supported laws that allow abortions after 20 weeks or so of gestation to protect a mother’s life or health. In the email to PolitiFact, Tuberville’s campaign cited an exchange between Jones and then-MSNBC host Chuck Todd in 2017: Todd: ""So, you wouldn't be in favor of legislation that said, ban abortion after 20 weeks or something like that?"" Jones: ""I'm not in favor of anything that is going to infringe on a woman's right and her freedom to choose. That's just the position that I've had for many years. It's a position I continue to have. But I want people to understand that once that baby is born, I’m going to be there for that child. That’s where I become a right-to-lifer."" But Jones also said this in 2017: ""I fully support a woman's freedom to choose to what happens to her own body. Having said that, the law for decades has been that late-term procedures are generally restricted except in the case of medical necessity. That's what I support. I don't see any changes in that."" The Supreme Court’s 1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade recognized a woman’s constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy, but it also allowed states to restrict abortions — including banning them altogether — after the point of fetal viability, except when the life or health of the woman is at stake, Darren Hutchinson, a law professor at the University of Florida, told PolitiFact. He said that case did not specify a precise time for viability, but 24 weeks’ gestation has widely been used in medicine and law. Jones continues to support laws that allow abortions beyond a certain number of weeks in order to protect the health of the mother. Jones was asked this year by an Alabama newspaper: ""What restrictions, if any, do you support on abortion? Does a woman have a right to an abortion in the case of a medical emergency or a pregnancy caused by sexual assault?"" In his response, published Oct. 12, 2020, Jones wrote: ""Your question is essentially the state’s existing law, which allows for an abortion in the case of a medical emergency or a pregnancy caused by sexual assault, which I support. I oppose late-term abortions, which are extremely rare, except for instances of rape, incest, or when the life and health of the mother is in jeopardy."" Tuberville said Jones ""has voted to spend our tax dollars on late-term abortions"" and ""supports abortion up until birth."" Neither part of the claim is accurate.  Jones voted against advancing a bill that would tighten existing limits on federal funding for abortion and add new restrictions, but he supports the Hyde Amendment — which prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest, or if the pregnancy is determined to endanger the woman’s life — as it stands.  He says he opposes ""late-term"" abortions, except for instances of rape, or incest or to save the mother’s life — the same exceptions as in the Hyde Amendment.

Facebook video edits Joe Biden’s comments on running for Senate, president
","An edited video on social media purports to show Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden telling Ohio voters that he’s running for Senate in 2020. ""Biden said he’s running for the Senate again!"" says the caption on the Oct. 12 Facebook post. The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Facebook clip is cut from Biden’s remarks during an Oct. 12 campaign event in Toledo, Ohio. The clip shows Biden saying, ""You know, we have to come together. That’s why I’m running. I’m running as a proud Democrat for the Senate. So vote! Vote! Visit iwill.com/ohio."" But Biden’s remarks — while clumsy — were taken out of context and edited, with a key portion omitted from the middle of his speech to give a misleading impression. The full footage from the event shows Biden was talking about running for office as a Democrat throughout his career in public service, but being prepared to serve all Americans as president. The comments were confusing because he spoke in the present tense while talking about running for the Senate. Biden represented Delaware in the Senate from 1973 to 2009 before serving two terms as vice president with President Barack Obama.  Here’s what Biden said, with the lines lifted for the edited Facebook video in bold:  ""You know, we have to come together. That’s why I’m running. I’m running as a proud Democrat for the Senate, when I had run as a proud Democrat for vice president, and I’m running as a proud Democrat for president. But I promise you this. I will govern as an American president. I’ll govern for everyone who voted for me, as well as against me. We can be better than what we’ve seen. We can be what we are at our best. The United States of America. So vote! Vote! Visit iwill.com/ohio. God bless you, and God bless the auto workers. God protect you. Thank you."" The Facebook video omits nearly 30 seconds from Biden’s remarks, including the moment where Biden said he is ""running as a proud Democrat for president."" (The correct website Biden inaccurately referenced is https://iwillvote.com/.) Similarly out-of-context videos were shared by President Donald Trump’s campaign and some of Trump’s media allies. In a segment about Biden on his TV show, Fox News host Sean Hannity showed a clip from Biden’s remarks that was edited in nearly the exact same way as the misleading Facebook video. Trump tweeted twice about the moment and mentioned it during a campaign rally in Florida. His campaign has tried for months to advance the narrative that Biden is senile — a claim geriatrics experts said is wrong. They have falsely claimed Biden is staying in a basement to hide it. The Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Biden, who grew up stuttering, has made some verbal blunders on the campaign trail. But social media users have often deceptively edited his remarks to manufacture errors. On the trail in South Carolina in February, Biden made a similar remark about being a Senate candidate.   ""South Carolina is going to determine who the next president of the United States is going to be,"" Biden said. ""You really are. You’re the ones that sent Bill Clinton to the presidency, and you're the ones that sent Barack Obama to the presidency. And I have a simple proposition here. I'm here to ask you for your help. Where I come from, you don't get far unless you ask. My name is Joe Biden. I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate. Look me over. If you like what you see, help out; if not, you can vote for the other guy. Give me a look, though."" The Trump campaign and his allies also seized on those comments. News outlets such as the Washington Post and Reuters reported that Biden misspoke.  Politico campaign reporter Natasha Korecki tweeted that Biden often closes his events by talking about his first campaign for Senate and reciting ""his old pitch"" from those days. A Biden campaign adviser retweeted a post making the same point. In South Carolina, Biden bungled the setup, the Washington Post’s national political correspondent Dave Weigel later noted. Biden was using the same language during that first Senate campaign in 1972, and he has done so repeatedly since, according to the Associated Press. The Democratic National Convention showed a video of Biden using the ""look me over"" line while running for Senate.  Biden made a less jumbled version of the same pitch to another group of Ohio voters in January, according to Cleveland.com.  After talking about knocking doors as a 29-year-old Senate candidate, introducing himself and telling people to ""look me over,"" Biden fit the phrase to his current campaign: ""Well, I’ll tell you what. I’m Joe Biden. I’m seeking the Democratic nomination for president of the United States. Look me over. If you like me, help me out. If not, you’ve got a lot of other good choices as well."" A Facebook video says Biden said, ""You know, we have to come together. That’s why I’m running. I’m running as a proud Democrat for the Senate. So vote! Vote!"" The video is deceptively edited and misleading. In context, Biden was talking about running for office as a ""proud Democrat"" throughout his career. The remarks were confusing because he used the present tense while talking about running for the Senate, but the Facebook video cut him off mid sentence. Biden actually said: ""I’m running as a proud Democrat for the Senate, when I had run as a proud Democrat for vice president, and I’m running as a proud Democrat for president. But I promise you this. I will govern as an American president … So vote! Vote!""

Wisconsin senator off-base with claim that it’s unknown whether young people spread COVID-19
","As a surge in COVID-19 cases threatens to overwhelm Wisconsin hospitals, Republican lawmakers are still pushing to overturn measures put in place by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to address it, including the statewide mask mandate.  That includes state Sen. Van Wanggaard, R-Racine, who told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he would not back a mask mandate even if the outbreak in Wisconsin became 10 times worse. (The mandate survived an initial court challenge Oct. 12, 2020.) Wanggaard also sought to downplay the seriousness of the virus in young people as he argued that young people should not have to wear masks.  He told the Journal Sentinel in an Oct. 7, 2020 video interview that no one under the age of 20 has died of COVID-19, and that ""it has not actually been determined yet"" that anyone under 20 can spread it to an older person.  This is off-base. Let’s break it down.  Wanggaard’s first claim is that no one under 20 has died of complications from the virus.  When pressed, Wanggaard backtracked and said that ""less than a third of a percent"" of those in that age group who have contracted COVID-19 have died.  This is more accurate. Of the nearly 500,000 cases confirmed among Americans ages 0-17, 96 have died, as of Oct. 12, 2020. But it’s not zero. (To be sure, as of Oct. 12, 2020, there were zero deaths in that category in Wisconsin, but Wangaard did not specify the state and was speaking broadly in the interview.) Even if the risk of serious illness is lower among young, healthy people, experts have long raised concerns that they could spread it to older adults who are more susceptible to serious illness and death. Wanggaard disputed that, claiming that it has not been determined whether a young person could spread the disease to an older person.   When asked for evidence to back up Wanggaard’s statement, a spokesman for the senator said he had Googled and found links to four studies conducted throughout the world that found children were rarely transmitting the virus and did not appear to be ""superspreaders"" -- that is, able to infect a disproportionate number of people.  But showing that young people rarely transmit the virus does not mean, as Wanggaard said, that we do not know whether they ever can.  A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on transmission dynamics by age group in hotspot areas of the U.S., released Oct. 9, 2020, found that the percentage of people testing positive among older age groups began to increase after it increased among people ages 0-17 and 18-24. That suggests that at least some younger people were passing the virus to older people.  It would have been fair for Wanggaard to say that the jury may still be out on how much young people drive transmission, especially young children.  But to say that it is not known whether someone under 20 can infect an older person is misleading at best.  What’s more, there is no scientific reason to believe that the virus would behave differently once the person infected turned 20 or older. Indeed, there have been numerous outbreaks on college campuses and in elementary and high schools around the country.
  Wanggaard told a reporter that COVID-19 had caused zero deaths in people under 20, later backtracking to say that it had caused very few, and claimed that it is unknown whether a person under 20 can pass the disease to an older adult.  While it’s correct that deaths among that age group are few, and some studies have found that young children did not account for a disproportionate amount of transmission of the virus, the senator’s statement is too absolute to account for the nuance.  Our definition of Mostly False is a claim that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.  That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967E2980>],/factchecks/2020/oct/14/van-wanggaard/wisconsin-senator-base-claim-its-unknown-whether-y/

Fact-checking Mike Pence’s historical hurricane claim
","As Hurricane Delta headed for the Gulf Coast, Vice President Mike Pence downplayed a connection between climate change and natural disasters striking the country, from wildfires to hurricanes. Susan Page, who moderated the Oct. 7 vice presidential debate, asked Pence if he believed, ""as the scientific community has concluded, that man-made climate change has made wildfires bigger, hotter, and more deadly and have made hurricanes wetter, slower and more damaging?"" Pence started his response by saying, somewhat inaccurately, what the Democratic presidential ticket would mean for fracking and the Green New Deal. ""With regard to hurricanes, the National Oceanic Administration tells us that actually, as difficult as they are, there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago,"" he said. RELATED: Fact-checking the VP debate, Kamala Harris vs. Mike Pence That comment might sound surprising given the busy 2020 hurricane season. Hurricane Delta was Louisiana’s fourth hurricane or tropical storm of the year. And for only the second time in history, forecasters in 2020 used up all 21 of the year’s Atlantic storm names and had to resort to Greek letters.  On the numerical comparison, Pence has a point. Hurricanes that reach U.S. land are happening about as often as they did 100 years ago. But that isn’t all the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other scientists have to say about hurricanes and climate change. Focusing only on the number of storms obscures warnings from NOAA and other scientists about the effect of climate change on future storms.  ""If we are thinking about what to expect in the coming century, it’s not just a matter of extrapolating what we saw in the past century,"" said Gabriel Vecchi, a former NOAA scientist who is now a Princeton University professor. Scientists are more concerned about the intensity of future storms. Phil Klotzbach, a scientist at Colorado State University, said scientists are continuing to disentangle questions about climate change and hurricanes. But it’s clear that skyrocketing population growth along the coast means storms today are more costly and destructive than 100 years ago, and sea level rise means more dangerous flooding from storm surge.  Pence didn’t specify whether he was referring to hurricanes that made landfall around the world, or just in the U.S. (The Trump campaign did not respond to our request for clarification.) The most reliable data is for U.S. landfalling hurricanes, so we’ll start there.  Jeff Masters, meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections, said it is true that the number of U.S. mainland landfalling Atlantic hurricanes has not changed appreciably in the past 100 years. There was one year about a century ago, in 1916, when nine tropical storms or hurricanes hit the mainland U.S. With Hurricane Delta, 10 have hit the U.S. this year. ""We are cruising through names at a record pace, but largely thanks to a lot of weak and/or short-lived ones,"" said Brian McNoldy, a University of Miami hurricane researcher. ""This is in stark contrast to the 2005 season, which also went into the Greek alphabet for the first time but produced many long-lived and very intense hurricanes."" This year’s busy season doesn’t necessarily mean we should expect more storms. ""Computer modeling results of Atlantic hurricanes are inconclusive on whether or not climate change will cause an increase or decrease in the number of Atlantic hurricanes in a future warmer climate, with some models showing a decrease, and some showing an increase,"" Masters said. ""But what theory and modeling do agree upon is that we will see the strongest hurricanes get stronger. Observations suggest that we are already seeing that occur."" Masters pointed to a June 2020 research article by scientists at NOAA and the University of Wisconsin-Madison that looked at global storms from 1979 to 2017. The number of major hurricanes — Category 3 or stronger — increased globally by 15% in the later half of that period. Major hurricanes are significantly more damaging than a Category 1 or 2 storm.  A September NOAA research analysis concluded that future hurricanes will be more intense with higher rainfall rates as a result of global warming. NOAA has said that rising sea levels, another effect of climate change, will increase the threat of storm-surge flooding during hurricanes. RELATED: Can a nuclear bomb stop a hurricane? No, it’s a myth that has persisted for decades Pence said that NOAA said ""there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago."" The data from NOAA show there’s no major difference between the number of storms today and a century ago. But his statistic doesn’t mean a lot on its own. What matters more is the intensity of hurricanes, and how climate change and sea level rise will affect future intensity.  We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097233140>],/factchecks/2020/oct/14/mike-pence/fact-checking-mike-pences-historical-hurricane-cla/
