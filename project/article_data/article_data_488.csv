Rick Kriseman wrongly suggests city didn't dip into reserves before Irma
","St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman and former Mayor Rick Baker offered conflicting stories about the city’s budget at their first mayoral forum since the August primary election. According to Baker, Kriseman tapped into emergency reserves this year in order to balance the city’s budget, despite record revenues. Kriseman defended himself by implying that the reach for reserves had not yet happened: ""We’ve been investing in reserves every year. If we go and have to dip into reserves for this year it will be because of Hurricane Irma and the losses that have been sustained by the city in overtime."" Baker didn’t let Kriseman have the last word. ""Mr. Kriseman must be able to read the future, because he went into the emergency reserves before Irma ever hit,"" Baker said. ""I don’t know how he did that."" Many in the audience erupted into laughter and clapped for Baker. But was Baker’s retort right? Basically, we found that the city has tapped into reserves. The city has plans to repay the loans. In May, the city council approved the transfer of $7.6 million to the Water Resources Capital Projects Fund to expedite infrastructure upgrades, which included projects to increase capacity at the water reclamation facilities. Half of the $7.6 million ($3.8 million) was taken out of the city’s economic stability fund — one of several types of reserve funds, and one specifically meant to cushion city coffers against economic downturns and natural disasters. The other half came from a different pot of money: the Water Resources department’s operating fund. The fund had an unappropriated balance, which, by definition, is not technically a reserve. (The Water Resources Department manages the city’s sewage and almost like an independent business.) Even though the city does not define this pool of money as reserves, some leaders consider it one and the same. In a Tampa Bay Times article, city council member Ed Montanari described the whole $7.6 million as reserves. There are many rules that govern whether reserves from the economic stability fund can be used, and one of the more relevant ones for this fact-check is the requirement for the city to repay the $3.8 million loan. That rules applies to reserves in the economic stability fund, but the city still hopes and has plans to replenish the whole $7.6 million loan after Water Resources department issues bonds. City officials said that would be in next couple months. So in this case, the city would issue bonds and sell them to investors. The city will pay back the the investors who bought one of those bonds in chunks. So the city is replenishing the money with more borrowed money. Kriseman’s team considers this ""paying back"" the loan, but that’s not how everyone in the city sees it. Montanari told the Tampa Bay Times he didn't agree with the city's decision to take $7.6 million to pay for sewer projects. ""I don't like the fact that we're taking money from reserves and replacing it with borrowed money,"" Montanari told the Times. ""I just want to state that on the record."" So, if the city already tapped into reserves, why did Kriseman make it seem like it hadn’t? Kriseman’s campaign clarified that his comments about reserves were ""strictly about the city response to Hurricane Irma."" ""While the city has not yet utilized the emergency reserves for Hurricane Irma, it is very likely that we will,"" said Kriseman spokesperson Ben Kirby. Kirby said the city will probably have to allocate reserves to pay city workers for the overtime they worked during the storm. He added that the majority of eligible expenses can be reimbursed by Federal Emergency Management Agency. Since Irma hit, the city requested FEMA assistance. Baker claimed that Kriseman tapped into reserves before Hurricane Irma ever hit. That is accurate. Under Kriseman, the city tapped into reserves early this year to cover the costs of infrastructure upgrades, which included projects to increase capacity at the water reclamation facilities. The the city plans to issue bonds to repay the loan, but there’s no saying when that will happen. Furthermore, bonds are just borrowed money.

Obamacare funding given to states unfairly, says repeal and replace supporter Ron Johnson
","Making a new argument for why the Affordable Care Act should be repealed, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson claimed that the health care law doesn’t pass the money around fairly. On Sept. 25, 2017, the Wisconsin Republican said on National Public Radio: Currently, it's really been quite unfair. I know that California, New York and Massachusetts, they represent about 20 percent of the population, they get close to 36 percent of Obamacare funding. It's just simply inequitable. It was a claim Johnson had also made twice on MSNBC and on Milwaukee television. And his three fellow co-sponsors of the latest Republican bill to overhaul Obamacare also made the statement a number of times to national media. So, what about the talking point? The numbers are more or less correct. But there’s one simple reason that explains most of the discrepancy: Those three states -- unlike Wisconsin and some others -- opted to take the additional federal funding offered by Obamacare to states that expanded Medicaid. ""When you don’t expand Medicaid, you get fewer of the dollars,"" said Georgetown University health policy analyst and political scientist Jack Hoadley. ""The dollars were sitting there for the taking and it was up to the governors and the state legislatures to come in and say yes. To the extent that they said no, they turned down that opportunity to get an equal share."" A little history Democratic President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in 2010. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the part of the law forcing states to expand Medicaid was unconstitutional. That meant it was up to each state whether to expand Medicaid, the state- and federal-funded program that provides health insurance coverage to people with low incomes.   In February 2016, GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker decided not to accept the additional federal funding provided by Obamacare to expand Medicaid, even though Wisconsin did partially expand the program. (We rated Mostly True Walker’s claim that he ""turned down a Medicaid expansion under Obamacare,"" but because of actions he took, for the first time in Wisconsin's history ""everyone living in poverty is covered under Medicaid."") The numbers Johnson’s office told us that California, New York and Massachusetts getting nearly 36 percent of Obamacare funding comes from an analysis by the staff of U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. Cassidy is one of the other co-sponsors of the GOP overhaul of Obamacare that was not brought up for an expected Senate vote because not enough GOP senators supported it. (Hours after the decision not to hold the vote, Johnson vowed not to give up on repealing Obamacare.) Ani Turner, one of the leaders of the nonprofit Altarum health consulting firm, said she calculated the percentage to be 32 percent. And Donna Friedsam, a health policy expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, put the figure at 33 percent. So, numbers-wise, Johnson is in the ballpark. But it’s misleading to claim the disproportionate funding is unfair or inequitable. The funding As Turner told us: ""Any government assistance program will fund more to states that have greater need, and will likely not simply follow the population share. Factors that would impact the proportion each state receives include whether the state chose to expand Medicaid and the share of people eligible for Medicaid or subsidies."" Turner and other experts pointed out that California, New York and Massachusetts were among states that opted to expand Medicaid. ""Other large states like Florida and Texas elected not to expand and thus left millions of federal dollars on the table,"" said Diane Rowland, executive vice president of the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. Rowland also noted that states such as New York and Massachusetts have higher health care costs, which means higher costs for people in Medicaid and thus more funding for those states. In short, Johnson and others praised states that did not take the extra money, but now argue that the states that did take the funding have too much. In any case, states had the option of whether to take the additional funding. Our rating Johnson says: ""California, New York and Massachusetts, they represent about 20 percent of the population, they get close to 36 percent of Obamacare funding. It's just simply inequitable."" He’s more or less correct on the numbers. But the main reason is that those three were among states that -- unlike Wisconsin and some others -- opted through Obamacare to expand Medicaid and take the additional federal funding that came with it. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/sep/29/ron-johnson/obamacare-funding-given-states-unfairly-says-repea/

It's true: A lot of people are leaving New York
","New York state’s population declined last year for the first time in a decade. State Republican Chairman Edward F. Cox blames the drop on Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Cuomo's economic policies make it hard for employers to add jobs, especially in upstate New York, so residents are leaving the state for better employment opportunities elsewhere, he said. ""We have the biggest outmigration of citizens of any state,"" Cox said. Thirty other states also lost population to other states last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Is Cox right that New York state tops that list? Latest data New York state lost a net 191,367 residents to other states between July 2015 and July 2016, more than any other state. Where are they going? The most popular destination is Florida, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. Almost 70,000 New York state residents moved to the Sunshine State in 2015. The second-most popular destination was New Jersey, which gained about 50,000 people from New York state. California ranked third with almost 37,000 people from New York. Brooklyn had the largest exodus from New York with a net 43,264 people moving from the borough to another state. Only three counties — Ontario, Saratoga, and Warren — had more people move in from another state than out. Since 2011 Last year was the worst year for domestic migration in New York state since at least 2011, the data shows. The state had a net loss of 90,342 people to other states between 2010 and 2011. That count has increased each year since, except for a short-lived dip in 2013. New York lost a net 846,669 people to other states between 2011 and 2016, more than any other state. Illinois recorded the second-highest outmigration in the country with a net loss of 540,166 residents. Again, Florida and New Jersey attracted the most New York residents. Almost 300,000 of them moved to Florida between 2011 and 2015. New Jersey ranked second, drawing about 225,000 people from New York state. Pennsylvania was the third most popular destination, with about 160,000 people migrating from New York state At the same time, New York state’s population has increased by 367,179 since 2010 thanks to almost 1.5 million births and migration from other countries. Migration rates Beyond raw counts, New York state has the biggest outmigration rate among the states if considering just domestic migration. Ten of every 1,000 New York state residents moved to another state in 2016. Illinois ranked second, with nine of every 1,000 residents in that state moving to another state. Governing magazine charted each state's migration rate -- the difference of in-migration and outmigration -- per 1,000 people in 2015-16, and it also included people coming and going from outside the country. New York state ranked fifth behind Illinois, Wyoming, North Dakota and Kansas. Our ruling Cox said New York has ""the biggest outmigration of citizens of any state."" By raw numbers alone, Cox is right. Census data shows more people are moving from New York state to other states than move from any other state. And the flow has become larger since 2011. Given that New York state has the nation's fourth-largest population, nearly 20 million, it's not surprising the numbers dwarf smaller states. But by proportion, and when including international migration, several other states have bigger outmigration rates.  We rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/sep/29/edward-cox/new-york-has-most-people-leaving-other-states-coun/

U.S. is only developed nation without mandated paid maternity leave
","Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill hosted dozens of town halls throughout the state in August. She made several bold statements during her visits with constituents, but one claim caught our attention. ""We’re the only developed nation in the world that doesn’t have paid maternity leave,"" McCaskill said on Aug. 22, 2017 at a town hall in Monett, Missouri. Last year, PolitiFact rated a similar statement by New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand as Mostly True, but a lot can change in year. So we decided McCaskill’s statement was worth a follow-up. The most frequently used measure of determining a developed country is the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), according to University of Missouri Associate law professor Sam Halabi. The United States became a member of the OECD in 1961, and is now one of 35 member countries. As of 2016, the United States had the third highest GDP per capita in the world. Sarah Feldman, a spokesperson for Sen. McCaskill, cited last year’s fact-check on Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand as evidence. ""Senator McCaskill and Senator Gillibrand made the same statement, with a few small differences: ‘industrial’ vs. ‘developed’ and ‘paid family leave’ vs. ‘paid maternity leave,’"" Feldman said. ""Maternity leave is a subset of paid family leave, so if a country has paid family leave it would have maternity leave as well."" The United States ranks dead last in a study conducted by the OECD on the national paid maternity leave policies of its member countries. The average amount of paid leave time for mothers among its members was a little over one year, as of 2016. Mexico comes in second-to-last place. Though there are some United States companies that provide paid maternity leave for employees, like Etsy, Ikea and Twitter, there is no national mandate. The Family and Medical Leave Act requires that mothers have a minimum of 12 weeks of unpaid maternity leave. California, Rhode Island and New Jersey are the only states with paid maternity leave mandates, and New York will join them beginning in 2018. But California and New Jersey only require six weeks of partial income replacement, and Rhode Island only requires four weeks of 60 percent income replacement. That’s nowhere near what some countries mandate that employers provide. Jessica Ciccone, St. Louis University School of Law director of communications, worked with Missouri Sen. Jill Schupp on Senate Bill 69, which would have created a state family and medical leave program this past legislative session. Gov. Eric Greitens signed an executive order providing paid maternity leave for the executive branch and encouraging the legislature to pass a similar measure. Ciccone cited an International Labour Organization study, which found Papua New Guinea and the United States are the only two of the 185 countries and territories reported in the study that do not provide paid maternity leave. Papua New Guinea is not considered an industrialized nation. Senator McCaskill said the United States is the only developed nation without paid maternity leave. Based on OECD and ILO data, the United States is the only industrialized nation without paid maternity leave. Yet, as previously reported in PolitiFact, some nations with paid maternity leave exclude certain groups of workers, meaning it isn’t quite universal. In the same sense, the United States has some states that do mandate paid maternity leave and parents can take unpaid time off after a child is born or adopted, although there isn’t a national law.

Donald Trump's dubious claim that his tax plan won't benefit him
","President Donald Trump, the only president in modern history to not release his tax returns (see our fact-check), said he would not personally benefit from his proposed changes to tax law. As he prepared to announce his proposal for a tax overhaul, he had the following exchange with an off-camera reporter. (Here’s the video ): Trump: ""My plan is for the working people, and my plan is for jobs."" Reporter: ""You wouldn't benefit under your tax plan?"" Trump: ""No, I don't benefit. I don't benefit. In fact, very very strongly, as you see, I think there's very little benefit for people of wealth."" President Trump on tax reform: ""My plan is for the working people, and my plan is for jobs. I don't benefit"" https://t.co/fEW6Y8FRft Trump reiterated that his plan was bad news for wealthy taxpayers like him later in his address in Indianapolis. ""They can call me all they want; not going to help,"" he said Sept. 27, 2017. ""I'm doing the right thing and it's not good for me, believe me."" Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns makes this difficult to know with certainty. When we inquired, the White House reiterated that Trump would not benefit but did not offer any documentation. PolitiFact’s longstanding policy is that the burden of proof is on the speaker. We won’t back up a speaker’s assertion without evidence. In the absence of that, what is known about Trump’s taxes suggests that his assertion is highly dubious. To date, two portions of Trump’s tax returns have been leaked to the media. One consists of summary pages from state tax returns from 1995, which were sent anonymously to the New York Times in 2016. However, because these are state -- not federal -- tax documents, they don’t shed much light on this claim. The second and more relevant forms are the summary pages from his 2005 federal tax return, which were first reported in March by MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. Experts see three provisions in Trump’s proposal that could potentially benefit him. Trump’s tax plan would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, which is a calculation that guarantees that certain higher-income taxpayers with large deductions pay at least a minimum amount of tax. ""This framework substantially simplifies the tax code by repealing the existing individual AMT,"" Trump’s proposal says. A line in Trump’s 2005 tax return shows that Trump paid $31,261,179 that year for the AMT. That was a large portion of his total tax bill. Had it not been for the AMT, Trump would have owed only about $5.3 million in federal taxes that year. Even if that was an unusually large year for Trump’s AMT liability, he is precisely the type of taxpayer the provision was designed for -- someone who is wealthy and who takes a lot of deductions. So if the AMT were to remain in place, it would likely be an ongoing tax burden for him. Trump’s plan would lower to 25 percent the tax rate for ""small and family owned businesses conducted as sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations."" Collectively, these are referred to as ""passthrough"" income. This policy would represent a reduction from the current top rate of 39.6 percent. (An earlier version of the Trump tax plan envisioned the rate going down all the way to 15 percent.) In his 2005 tax return, Trump listed more than $67 million in income from ""rental real estate, royalties, partnerships, S corporations, trusts, etc."" Even if the proposed changes didn’t affect that entire flow of income, some of it likely would, enabling Trump to keep more of it. An analysis using Trump’s initial 15 percent proposal that was published by the Democratic staff of the House Ways and Means Committee said that Trump would save about $28.6 million from the reduction of this ""pass-through income"" rate. Trump’s potential savings would be smaller -- though still substantial -- under the newer proposal of 25 percent. Trump’s proposal also ""repeals the death tax,"" which is what many opponents call the tax officially known as the estate tax. In 2017, estates worth less than $5.49 million are exempt from taxation, according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. Above $5.49 million, the estate is generally taxed at 40 percent. Estimates of Trump’s net worth vary; in February, Forbes estimated that it was $3.5 billion. If that’s in the ballpark, then under current law, Trump’s estate could have to pay tax in the vicinity of $1 billion. In any case, since Trump’s estate at his death would almost certainly be worth more than the exemption level of $5.49 million, he would be a good candidate to owe some amount of estate tax, even if it’s not as high as $1 billion. Unlike the proposed changes to the alternative minimum tax and the taxation of ""passthrough"" income, the elimination of the estate tax would not be a change that Trump or his heirs could take advantage of immediately. Still, if the estate tax were to be eliminated permanently, that would likely offer the Trump family a substantial tax savings down the road.   Referring to his tax proposal, Trump said, ""No, I don't benefit. I don't benefit."" Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns makes it impossible to quantify exactly how much he would personally benefit from his policy proposals. But what is known about Trump’s past patterns of taxation and his income and wealth holdings strongly suggest that at least three proposed changes -- to the alternative minimum tax, to the tax on ""passthrough"" income, and to the estate tax -- would benefit Trump or his family either immediately or down the road.

Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim about the estate tax, small businesses and farms
","During a speech in Indianapolis launching his proposal for tax overhaul legislation, President Donald Trump said that one element of the plan -- elimination of the estate tax -- would lift a burden on many family businesses and farms. ""To protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer, we are finally ending the crushing, the horrible, the unfair estate tax, or as it is often referred to, the death tax,"" Trump said in his Sept. 27 speech. He continued, ""That means, especially for all of you with small businesses that are really tremendous businesses, you’ll be able to leave them to your family, and your family won’t have to run out and do a fire sale to try and get the money to pay the tax. ...  The farmers in particular are affected. They have wonderful farms, but they can't pay the tax, so they have to sell the farm.  … So that death tax is a disaster for this country and a disaster for so many small businesses and farmers."" We’ve addressed the question of how many small businesses and farmers pay the estate tax in previous fact-checks, but Trump’s assertion that eliminating the estate tax would ""protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer"" goes well beyond what we’ve heard before. And the data doesn’t support it. The estate tax comes into play when someone dies and their estate is large enough to qualify for the tax. The estate tax was first established in 1916 to offset a decline in tariff revenue caused by the first World War, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Congress has tinkered with it many times throughout the years. In 2017, estates worth less than $5.49 million are exempt from the tax, according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. Above $5.49 million, the estate is generally taxed at 40 percent. However, family-owned farms and closely-held businesses may be able to pay less or pay in low-interest installments. So how many estates are affected by the tax? Not many, and the people who pay it are usually among the country’s richest families. For 2017, the Tax Policy Center estimated, based on past tax data and modeling, that 11,310 individuals will have estates big enough to file an estate tax return. ""After allowing for deductions and credits, 5,460 estates will owe tax,"" the center concluded. ""Over two-thirds of these taxable estates will come from the top 10 percent of income earners and close to one-fourth will come from the top 1 percent alone."" The top 10 percent of income earners would pay 88 percent of estate tax revenues, the center found, while the richest 0.1 percent could pay 27 percent. How about small businesses and farms? The center projected that only about 80 small farms and closely held businesses would pay any estate tax in 2017. That would amount to about 1 percent of all payers of the estate tax that year. And the estate tax revenue from small businesses and farms, the center said, would amount to fifteen-hundredths of 1 percent of the total paid under the estate tax in 2017. So, getting rid of the estate tax would hardly ""protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer,"" as Trump put it. Trump's claim doesn't hold up even if you account for small businesses and farms that would potentially benefit from elimination down the road. The number from the Tax Policy Center (80) only refers to the number of small businesses and farms that would have to pay the tax this year. Multiplying the amount of small business and farm-based estate taxpayers who are living today by deaths over the next 70 years would still just result in 5,600 small businesses or farms potentially relieved of the tax — vastly smaller than Trump’s ""millions.""  Trump said that ending the estate tax would ""protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer."" That’s a ridiculously high estimate. Only 5,460 estates even pay the tax each year, according to a credible estimate, and of those, about 80 represented small businesses or farms.

Donald Trump wrongly blames ‘hospitalized’ senator for GOP health care collapse
","President Donald Trump claimed that Senate Republicans could pass a health care reform bill by the end of September if a senator’s hospitalization weren’t preventing him from casting the deciding vote. ""We have one senator who’s a ‘yes’ vote, a great person, but he’s in the hospital,"" Trump told Fox & Friends in a Sept. 27 interview. ""And he’s a ‘yes’ vote. So we can’t do it by Friday. So we have the votes."" Trump repeated similar claims throughout the day. ""With one Yes vote in hospital & very positive signs from Alaska and two others (McCain is out), we have the HCare Vote, but not for Friday!"" Trump tweeted Sept. 27.  With one Yes vote in hospital & very positive signs from Alaska and two others (McCain is out), we have the HCare Vote, but not for Friday! We decided to look more closely at whether Senate Republicans in fact have the needed votes, and if a hospitalized senator, unable to cast his ""yes"" vote, is preventing its passage. It doesn’t appear so. Under congressional rules, Republicans had until September 30 to pass the bill with a simple majority. Republican hold 52 seats in the Senate, meaning they could afford to lose two senators, and still pass the legislation, with the vice president casting the tie-breaking vote. No Democrats were expected to support the legislation. As of Sept. 25, however, three Senate Republicans — Maine Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, Arizona Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul — were firm ""no"" votes. Still others expressed skepticism about the overhaul. So at most, even with all senators in attendance, Republicans had 49 votes in the Senate, short of the simple majority it needed for the bill to clear the chamber. Trump’s repeated claims about a hospitalized senator were an apparent reference to Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss. For his part, Cochran tweeted yesterday to clarify that he was ill but not in the hospital. ""Thanks for the well-wishes. I'm not hospitalized, but am recuperating at home in Mississippi and look forward to returning to work soon,"" Cochran tweeted.  Thanks for the well-wishes. I'm not hospitalized, but am recuperating at home in Mississippi and look forward to returning to work soon. Cochran’s office told the USA Today the senator was recovering from what they referred to as treatment for a ""urological issue."" It’s unclear whether Cochran’s health concerns would prevent him from returning to cast a vote on the health care reform. But what’s clear is that even with his vote, Senate Republicans are still short of the majority.  Trump said Senate Republicans would have enough votes to pass health care reform but for a hospitalized senator who’s unable to cast the deciding vote. At most, Senate Republicans have 49 ""yes"" votes — that’s short of the majority they need to pass the latest health care overhaul. This shortfall would not be overcome even with a ""yes"" vote from Cochran, who is not hospitalized, but rather recuperating at home after receiving medical treatment. We rate this False.

Was Reed virtually absent from regional issues? No
","At a recent candidate forum in Atlanta’s mayoral race, John Eaves touted his credentials as a force for broad economic development. The former Fulton County chairman said he understands what the job requires. ""I’ve been there, done that,"" Eaves said. ""The current city mayor has been virtually absent in terms of regional cooperation the last eight years. As mayor of Atlanta, I’ll continue to work with regional partners."" Term limits have the current mayor Kasim Reed stepping down after two terms. During his time in office, Atlanta proper has attracted new jobs. But did Reed aim to advance the city’s future without regard for the surrounding cities and counties? A 2013 blog post faulted Reed for failing to attend many meetings of the Atlanta Regional Commission. Between 2010 and August 2013, he missed 24 meetings out of 36 total. Only one other member of the commission board had a worse attendance record. That is one yardstick, but there are others to measure Reed’s presence in regional issues. One of Reed’s top priorities has been the deepening of the Port of Savannah, about 250 miles from the city. In 2015, the Georgia Port Authority said the port supported about 370,000 jobs across the state. Reed is credited for working with Republican lawmakers and the state’s Republican governor to push the project forward. The Trump administration has included $50 million for the nearly $1 billion effort, far short of what state and local officials sought, but a modest victory in a budget cutting environment. Reed has also promoted expansion of Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport, an anchor for economic development in the region. Reed struck an agreement with Delta Airlines to keep the company in Atlanta for the next two decades. In the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics report, the Atlanta region led among the nation’s 12 largest metropolitan areas in the rate of job growth, and ranked third overall for the number of jobs added in the past year. Companies that have moved to the region include Mercedes-Benz and State Farm, both of which located just outside the city of Atlanta. Symbolic of regional cooperation, the groundbreaking ceremony for the Mercedes-Benz headquarters building featured Gov. Nathan Deal, Reed and Sandy Springs Mayor Rusty Paul. Reed touts his push for half-a-cent increase in the Atlanta sales tax to finance a $2.6 billion expansion of the regional subway system, the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority. While the work would take place inside the city, the MARTA system extends out to the surrounding cities. His work on regional transportation links to Eaves’ criticism of Reed. Eaves led a group of Fulton County mayors to craft a joint transportation investment plan. According to one news report, Reed chafed at having a vote that was equal to that of mayors from much smaller communities. Through a spokeswoman, Eaves said, ""Over the course of my tenure establishing the Mayors’ Council, Reed did not really play a role, giving off the general sense that he was more important than the other 14 mayors."" But Reed did participate and remained open to a compromise approach hammered out by the group. Eaves said Reed has been virtually absent from regional cooperation over his eight years in office. This seems to be rooted in Reed’s attitude toward a mayors’ initiative led by Eaves. There is also some evidence that Reed failed to faithfully attend meetings of Atlanta’s Regional Commission. However, in terms of promoting major development activity that boosted jobs across the region, Reed was deeply involved and can take credit for playing a key role. Reed might have rubbed some local officials the wrong way, but for residents, tangible results matter more than style. There’s a sliver of truth.

No, Washington state did not change its name because George Washington owned slaves

","Feeding off of the national discussion about the prominence of Confederate statues, a fake news article claimed one state went so far as to change its name to distance itself from the country’s first president. The fake news headline said, ""Washington State Legislature votes to change its name because George Washington owned Slaves."" With 50,267 shares as of Sept. 27, the article says that the state is now named ""Soros State,"" after investor and philanthropist, George Soros for, according to the article, all of his help in eliminating the history of slavery in the United States. However, the Soros State does not exist, because the state of Washington did not change its name. The article was made on a site called www.breakingnews365.net. The About section at the bottom of this site states, ""This website is an entertainment website, news are created by users. These are humourous news, fantasy, fictional, that should not be seriously taken or as a source of information."" (The poor grammar is how it appears on the page.)

George Soros is the founder of Open Society Foundations, a philanthropic organization devoted to strengthening democracy and protecting marginalized communities.

But unlike what the story claimed, Soros does not have any apparent history of trying to eliminate the history of slavery in the United States.

Woodhouse says GOP is winning unaffiliated voters in NC
","The number of unaffiliated voters recently surpassed the number of registered Republicans in North Carolina, leaving the GOP as the third largest voting bloc on paper. According to NC GOP’s executive director, Dallas Woodhouse, Republicans should view this as good news. Upon hearing that there are now 2,640,000 registered Democrats, 2,056,000 unaffiliated voters and 2,055,000 Republicans, Woodhouse said unaffiliated voters have helped Republicans more than Democrats in recent elections. ""It is important to note that since 2010, Republicans have won unaffiliated voters in every general election,"" he said. As Woodhouse acknowledged in an email, there’s no way to tell how individual voters cast a ballot – because voting ballots are secret. The N.C. State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement cannot compile or release data on how any group of registered voters voted, said Pat Gannon, the board’s spokesman. ""Because of the secrecy of the ballot, we wouldn’t be able to determine who unaffiliated voters voted for,"" Gannon said. So there’s that obstacle. But does that mean Woodhouse is wrong? Election results In fact, election results and exit polls tend to back him up. Basically, Woodhouse argues that Republicans have outperformed Democrats in many recent statewide election results, despite having fewer registered voters. In 2010, Republican Sen. Richard Burr won re-election. In 2012, for the first time in decades, a Republican won the race for governor. After going for President Barack Obama in 2008, the state supported Republican Mitt Romney. In 2014, Republican Thom Tillis unseated incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan, a Democrat. In 2016, NC voters favored Republican Donald Trump for President, Democrat Roy Cooper for Governor and Burr for Senate. Woodhouse mostly focused on the races for president, governor and senator. But Cooper is one of several Democrats who won statewide races over the years, including for state auditor (Beth Wood), secretary of state (Elaine Marshall) and attorney general (Cooper, then Josh Stein). Don’t those victories weigh against Woodhouse’s claim? That brings us to the evidence from exit polls. Exit polls Woodhouse provided links to several exit polls that show self-described independents consistently supporting Republicans and PolitiFact found other polls that show the same pattern. There’s one caveat to this: people don’t always describe themselves accurately in exit polls. A 2017 Elon University poll found a difference between voters who were registered with a party but identified themselves as independents. The Elon poll found that 43 percent of the roughly 500 voters surveyed identified as independent. But only 30 percent were unaffiliated. But here’s what exit polls have found: A CNN exit poll in the 2016 elections for president, governor and Senate, which surveyed about 4,000 people, asked voters to identify themselves as Republican, Democrat or independent as well as liberal, conservative or moderate. The polls found that independents favored Trump, Burr and McCrory. Moderates, however, supported the Democrats in each race. A Quinnipiac poll published a day before the election supports the findings of the CNN exit poll. Quinnipiac gave the edge to Cooper, despite finding that independent voters favored McCrory. It showed independents supporting Burr and Trump at an even higher rate. An Elon University poll from 2016 also showed independents breaking for McCrory. And an exit poll done for a group of media organizations and published by the New York Times showed a similar breakdown: independents and those favoring third parties favored Trump and moderates favored Hillary Clinton. A 2014 CNN exit poll shows self-identified ""independents"" supported Republican Thom Tillis over Democrat Kay Hagan 49 percent to 42 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, self-identified ""moderates"" favored Hagan 59 percent to 36 percent. According to another exit poll published by the New York Times, this one in the 2012 presidential election, self-identified independents favored Romney and moderates favored Obama. Participation in primaries Recent primary elections reflect what the exit polls suggest: that unaffiliated voters are more interested in voting for Republicans than Democrats. In North Carolina, unaffiliated voters can participate in the primary elections for any party they choose. Stats provided by the state elections board show that unaffiliated voters have overwhelmingly participated in the Republican primary in each election since 2010. In 2010, 54 percent of unaffiliated voters took Republican ballots while 39 percent took Democratic ballots. In 2012, 44 percent took GOP ballots while 30 percent took Democratic ballots. In 2014, 61 percent took Republican ballots while 33 percent took Democratic ballots. And in 2016, 56 percent took GOP ballots while 41 percent took Democratic ballots. The consistent participation in Republican primaries shows many unaffiliated voters have partisan leanings and puts the idea of unaffiliated voters as ""swing voters"" into doubt. ""In fact, most independents who ‘lean’ to one party over the other vote at levels comparable to partisans, at least nationally,"" said Michael Bitzer, professor of politics and history at Catawba College in Salisbury. Bitzer’s comments are supported by a 2016 Pew Research study, which notes that most independents express a partisan leaning. What experts think Most experts PolitiFact spoke with suggested Woodhouse’s claim is on track, even though it’s nearly impossible to verify with complete certainty. Jason Husser, director of the Elon University poll, warned against people making assumptions without polling of voters whose partisan affiliations are known. ""The only way anyone could make that ‘every general election since 2010,’ claim with confidence is if they have multiple quality surveys using voter registration list samples (not random digital dial samples),"" Husser said. ""Otherwise they couldn't differentiate registered as unaffiliated voters from self-identified independents (who are often registered with a party)."" Still, Tom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling, a left-leaning polling firm, described the claim as ""basically right."" ""Democrats still having such a large registration advantage over Republicans,"" Jensen said, ""basically means it’s impossible for Republican candidates to win statewide without winning independents."" Our ruling Woodhouse stated unequivocally that Republicans have ""won"" North Carolina’s unaffiliated voters in each general election since 2010. There is no way to prove that claim with complete certainty because ballots are private. And exit polls can be unreliable because voters sometimes misrepresent their political allegiances. However, polls and primary participation stats show a consistent trend of unaffiliated voters voting for Republicans. Furthermore, given the relatively lower number of registered Republicans, experts say the GOP wouldn’t have achieved its recent success without repeatedly winning over unaffiliated voters. PolitiFact rates this claim Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2017/sep/27/dallas-woodhouse/woodhouse-says-gop-winning-unaffiliated-voters-nc/

Donald Trump largely accurate about drugs catapulted across the U.S.-Mexico border
","A border wall with Mexico is happening, but it has to be see-through so that Americans aren’t knocked out by 100 pounds of drugs catapulted across the border, President Donald Trump told supporters. Trump offered the catapult story as an example of the lengths people are going to in order to get drugs into the United States. ""So now they take drugs, literally, and they throw it, a hundred pounds of drugs. They throw it over the wall, they have catapults, but they throw it over the wall, and it lands and it hits somebody on the head. You don't even know they're there,"" Trump said Sept. 22 in Alabama while campaigning for Luther Strange, who was later defeated by Roy Moore for the Republican nomination in the Senate race to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions. ""Believe it or not, this is the kind of stuff that happens. So you need to have a great wall, but it has to be see-through,"" Trump said. Back in July, Trump also spoke of a need for a transparent wall to avoid getting hit by 60-pound sacks of drugs. This fact-check won’t get into whether a see-through wall is the best approach for border security. What we wanted to know is if drugs have been catapulted across the border and hit people on the head. Trump was largely accurate about drugs being catapulted. Immigration officials have seized marijuana launched across the border, and in some cases, found catapults. Whether people have been hit on the head by these sacks is uncertain. Reports from U.S. Customs and Border Protection about catapults date back at least to 2011. An attempt to catapult marijuana into the United States failed in January 2011 after U.S. officials noticed the preparation through remote video surveillance. They contacted Mexican authorities who went over and thwarted the plan. Mexican officials seized a sport utility vehicle, about 45 pounds of marijuana and ""a catapult capable of launching contraband into the U.S.,"" the release said. The attempt happened near Naco, Ariz. In February, Border Patrol agents in Douglas, Ariz. seized two bundles of marijuana catapulted from Mexico, weighing more than 47 pounds combined, CBP said in a news release. Agents on patrol noticed several people retreating from the south side of the border fence as the agents approached, CBP said, and at the fence ""they found a catapult system attached to the south side of the border fence."" A search of the area led them to the two bundles of marijuana. #USBP agents spring into action dismantling catapult used to launch #Marijuana #HonorfirstDetails: https://t.co/NfhWwej7G7 pic.twitter.com/wJ3HPMLTuN In July, the Douglas Police Department in Arizona seized more than 140 pounds of marijuana launched over the border fence. An officer responding to calls about bundles being launched over found ""a large bundle of marijuana that had broken upon impact, exposing multiple smaller bundles inside,"" CBP said. And last month, Border Patrol agents in Arizona operating remote video surveillance saw an object launched over the border. Other agents then went to the area and found a large cylindrical bundle of marijuana weighing more than 96 pounds and worth $48,000, CBP reported. Sanho Tree, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies and director of its Drug Policy Project, said he hadn’t heard of any injuries associated with catapults or trebuchets (a common type of catapult). ""Traffickers have definitely used catapults (and trebuchets) to hurl drug packages over the existing wall, but the chance of anyone getting hit by such a package along a 2,000-mile wall is simply laughable,"" Tree said. Other experts also told us that cartels have used catapults to throw marijuana over the border, but they were unaware of anyone actually being hit by the bundles. There are drug catapults and trebuchets that launch loads up to 100 pounds over the border wall, but that happens very rarely. Smaller payloads of 20 to 40 pounds are more common with the drug catapults, said Brandon Behlendorf, an assistant professor at the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security & Cybersecurity within University at Albany, SUNY. Trump said, ""So now they take drugs literally and they throw it, a hundred pounds of drugs. They throw it over the wall, they have catapults, but they throw it over the wall and it lands and it hits somebody on the head."" Trump is accurate that, from time to time, catapults have been used at the border by traffickers. Packages of marijuana thrown over the border range from less than 50 pounds to more than 100 pounds. But we found no reports of people on the U.S. side of the border hit by the falling bundles.

Is North Korea the 4th most sanctioned nation?
","Amid a war of words between the United States and North Korea, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., took to the Sunday shows to argue Washington should apply more pressure to Pyongyang. While the United States has recently dialed up sanctions against Kim Jong Un’s regime, Gardner argued they could go further. ""(North Korea) is now the fifth or fourth most sanctioned nation,"" Gardner said, ""meaning that we have a long ways to go to continue to ratchet up the economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea and the enablers of North Korea."" We decided to investigate how sanctions against North Korea compare with those targeting other countries. An aide to Gardner pointed us to a chart from a recent paper by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. That paper, which was presented before Congress, ranks North Korea as the fourth most sanctioned country, behind Ukraine/Russia, Syria and Iran, respectively. Rankings were derived by comparing countries according to the number of sanctioned people and entities tracked by the Treasury Department. That sanctions list is officially known as the Office of Foreign Assets Control Specially Designated Nationals list, or OFAC list. It’s important to note that the data in the chart below was current as of Aug. 29, 2017, so it doesn’t include more recent sanctions.  Gardner cited the above data not only to drive home his point that North Korea could be more heavily sanctioned, but also to show the impact of legislation he backed, the North Korea Policy Sanctions Enhancement Act, which took effect Feb. 18, 2016. ""Last year, when Congress passed my legislation, North Korea was the eighth most sanctioned nation on Earth,"" Gardner said. ""As a result of that legislation, it's now the fifth or fourth most sanctioned nation, meaning that we have a long ways to go to continue to ratchet up the economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea and the enablers of North Korea."" (Note: We’re interested here in U.S. sanctions, not sanctions imposed by other countries.) We asked the Treasury Department whether the rankings were accurate but did not receive a reply by publication time. Even if you assume the raw numbers are correct, several experts we spoke to thought this approach to country rankings was problematic—though some allowed that a more far-reaching measurement would be tough to calculate. Experts’ main objection was that ranking countries based solely on the quantity of sanctions wouldn’t necessarily capture the quality, or impact, of sanctions. ""Gauging how tough sanctions are is not simply a count of measures taken, but what share of economic activity they are covering, how willing other states are to implement them, and the related ability of the country to circumvent them through evasion,"" said Stephan Haggard, a professor of Korea-Pacific Studies at the University of California-San Diego. Joseph deThomas, professor of international affairs at Penn State University, said that while there is ""no perfect method"" for setting up a ranking system of this kind, basing it on the quantity of sanctions alone misses the mark. He suggested taking into account ""the amount of financial, economic or national security pain inflicted on the sanctioned country."" ""Is a country with a lot of people banned from getting visas more sanctioned than one that has one sanction on its Central Bank that denies it access to the dollar?"" DeThomas said. ""Not likely."" We reached out to Anthony Ruggiero, who authored the Foundation for Defense of Democracies paper, who argued the quantitative approach illuminates several key points about North Korea, relative to other sanctioned countries. He also emphasized the importance of reading the qualitative discussion of North Korean sanctions elsewhere in the paper.   ""This approach verifies North Korea is not the most sanctioned county in the world, and provides a pathway toward further invest of additional sanctions against North Korea and its facilitators,"" he said. Some experts acknowledged the difficulty of carrying out a more holistic approach. ""As you can imagine, such a modeling exercise is really, really hard, and a count of measures is not going to do the work,"" Haggard said. Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said there are better ways of assessing sanctions impact, ""but they require actual time, effort, and modeling, and honestly there isn’t much of a market for comparative sanctions analysis."" Gardner said, ""(North Korea) is now the fifth or fourth most sanctioned nation."" A paper by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies ranks North Korea as the fourth most sanctioned country, behind Ukraine/Russia, Syria and Iran, respectively. According to the paper’s author, rankings were based on the Treasury Department’s list of sanctioned people and entities. The Treasury Department did not confirm the rankings. However, experts we spoke to said ranking countries based solely on its number of sanctions was problematic because numbers alone wouldn’t necessarily capture the total impact of sanctions.

PAC ad: Republican Senate candidate Sullivan wrote a bill to cut Alaskans out of hunting decisions
","In a state where fishing and hunting are a way of life, it's no surprise that the issue is packing a punch in the Alaska Senate race, a high-profile race in which incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Begich is seeking a second term. Put Alaska First -- a political action committee funded by the Senate Majority PAC, which has close ties to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. -- released a television ad blasting Republican candidate Dan Sullivan for his involvement in crafting a controversial state bill that, according to the ad, would affect Alaskans’ input on fishing and hunting policy. The ad features Sam Cotten, a resident of Eagle River, Alaska, and a former state senator, saying, ""The fishing industry is part of who we are here in Alaska. When decisions are being made about where we can hunt, where we can fish, Alaskan voices shouldn't be taken out of the picture."" The ad then cuts to a narrator, who says, ""But it was Dan Sullivan who wrote the bill to cut Alaskans out of those decisions."" We wondered whether Sullivan, one of two leading candidates in the GOP primary, had really made that kind of power grab, so we took a closer look. Who’s behind the bill? The claim stems from a piece of controversial legislation presented to the Alaska State Legislature in January 2013. House Bill 77, supported by the state Department of Natural Resources, aimed to improve and speed up the process for approving land and water-use permits. Most of the public outcry focused on a provision in the original draft that would in some cases have allowed the DNR to award general-use permits without giving the public the opportunity to review or comment on the proposals. The bill also took away the right of tribes, groups and individuals to secure in-stream fishing areas that were protected from mining and other development projects. The bill's main critics were fishers, tribal groups, conservation groups and people who felt the DNR was taking power away from individuals. Hundreds of people signed up to offer public testimony against the legislation, and few stood up to support it. When the bill was introduced, Sullivan was the Commissioner of Natural Resources, and by most accounts, he was deeply involved in the overarching effort to overhaul the permitting system and reduce backlogs. ""Whether he personally penned any part of the bill is uncertain, but he definitely had some influence,"" said Carl Shepro, a political science professor emeritus at the University of Alaska. ""That lends some credence to the statement"" in the ad, he said. Throughout his tenure as commissioner, which ended in the fall of 2013, Sullivan defended the DNR’s efforts to change with the permitting system. ""I led that effort, and I’m proud of that effort,"" Sullivan said in an interview with Radio Kenai in March 2014, referring to his overall strategy to overhaul the permitting system. But the bill's language was broad, so critics were worried that the DNR could potentially permit large-scale and high-impact projects -- such as mining -- without public input. That, in turn, could have handed the commissioner -- Sullivan, at the time -- significantly more power. However, the ad glosses over a few nuances. First, the ad doesn’t note that the bill failed to make it through the Alaska Legislature in 2013, largely due to public opposition, and again in 2014. Second, the ad’s wording suggests that Sullivan’s sole intent was to cut out public discussion of permitting decisions, when in fact that was a byproduct of a broader effort to improve the permitting process. The idea of the original bill was that the commissioner should be able to issue a permit for small-scale proposals -- such as allowing someone to dock their boat near their waterfront property -- without notifying the public. And third, the ad may have exaggerated the potential impact of the measure, implying that the bill would have kept Alaskans out of discussions regarding hunting, rather than just fishing. Some HB 77 critics have said the broad language would have allowed it to affect hunting, because land access plays a big role in hunting, Shepro said. If the DNR limited land use through the authority granted under HB 77’s original draft, the department could have restricted hunting without having to go through public review processes. Still, this is speculative. The bill’s text does not make any reference to hunting or game activity. And judging by what the law’s critics complained about, the main concerns centered on fishing, not hunting. The Sullivan campaign said the law would not affect the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s regulatory authority over hunting. But the ad’s creators thought the bill’s language created a slippery slope. ""If you are a hunter, and you hunt a popular state-owned tract of land, the commissioner can hand that land over to a developer without a public hearing and without adhering to existing laws and (regulations), under HB 77,"" said Jim Lottsfeldt, Put Alaska First senior adviser. Our Ruling: Put Alaska First PAC said in a television ad that Sullivan ""wrote a bill to cut Alaskans out of"" decisions about where citizens can hunt and fish. As commissioner of natural resources, Sullivan did indeed push legislation to limit the public's ability to review and comment on development proposals. However, the ad glosses over a few complicating issues, including the stated goal of the proposal, and suggests, rather speculatively, that hunters could be affected. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/jun/13/put-alaska-first-pac/pac-ad-says-republican-senate-candidate-dan-sulliv/

U.S. army was smaller than the army for Portugal before World War II
","History shows Texas has an opportunity to fend off President Barack Obama’s ""attacks on our liberty,"" Ken Paxton, the Republican nominee for attorney general of Texas, told his party’s state convention this month. Paxton, a McKinney state senator, didn’t call for a Texas-wide arms build-up, but he offered an analogy to war. ""Think about the greatest generation and World War II,"" Paxton said. ""At the beginning of World War II, we had a relatively small army ... smaller than Portugal’s. And yet we put together a military that fought on two fronts against two great superpowers. In the midst of dire circumstances,"" Paxton said, adding: ""Texas has that same opportunity."" The mighty USA had a pre-war army smaller than comparable forces in Portugal? To our inquiry, Paxton consultant Anthony Holm pointed out a historian’s July 22, 2010, article on President Franklin Roosevelt and Great Britain in WW II. David Woolner wrote that in June 1939, which was three months before England declared war on Germany, ""the roughly 180,000-man U.S. Army ranked 19th in the world--smaller than Portugal’s!"" Woolner  continued: ""To bolster America’s security, FDR not only called for an increase in the size of the nation’s military budget, and the repeal of the arms embargo provisions within the 1930s neutrality legislation, he also quietly sought to strengthen America’s ties with Great Britain--the one nation whose combined military, political and economic strength might serve as a bulwark against a possible Axis aggression in the Western Hemisphere."" Woolner, a senior fellow at the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute, told us by email his pre-war comparison to Portugal has appeared in many books over decades. ""I should also point out here that the small size of the U.S. Army in 1938-39 is sometimes referenced as being ranked 17th in the world, sometimes listed as smaller than Belgium, etc. it depends to a certain extent when the comparison is being made.,"" Woolner said. ""The main point is that in the interwar years, the U.S. Congress and public were very isolationist, and the United States was not the same sort of world leader it is today. That change came under Franklin Roosevelt, who orchestrated the largest military build-up in world history."" Some online searching led us to the Army’s compilation of Gen. George C. Marshall’s reports on the Army’s progress during the war, covering July 1939 through June 1945. Marshall, who was later secretary of state, was the Army’s chief of staff. The foreword says: ""For the feat of transforming the miniscule interwar Army to the great force that defeated the Axis in Africa, Europe, the Pacific, and Asia, no one could claim more credit than Marshall. When he took office, the 174,000-man U.S. Army ranked nineteenth in size in the world, behind Portugal and only slightly ahead of Bulgaria. Its half-strength divisions were scattered among numerous posts, its equipment obsolete, its reliance on the horse increasingly anachronistic."" We also reached out to the U.S Army Center of Military History at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. By email, the center’s James Tobias provided a document tallying active-duty U.S. Army soldiers year by year from 1930 into 2011. According to the document, there were 187,893 active-duty Army soldiers as of June 30, 1939; the army ballooned to nearly 8.3 million active-duty soldiers, its record high, by the end of May 1945.

Have there been 74 school shootings since Sandy Hook? A closer look at a tricky statistic
","After an Oregon high school freshman armed with an assault rifle injured a teacher, killed a student and killed himself Tuesday, a striking statistic began circulating on the internet. It said that at least 74 school shootings had occurred since December 2012, when an assault on Sandy Hook Elementary School by Adam Lanza left 28 dead, including Lanza and his mother. The statistic came from Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and gun-control advocate Shannon Watts. That comes out to more than one school shooting per week. Numerous media outlets reported the 74 school shootings figure, and the number spread widely in Facebook posts and through other forms of social media. Even President Barack Obama brought up the once-a-week line in an interview with Tumblr CEO David Karp. In the interview, Obama discussed his frustration with lawmakers’ inaction on gun control legislation, particularly in the wake of Sandy Hook. While it’s not clear that Obama was specifically referencing the statistic compiled by Everytown, his comment was in line with their math. ""We’re the only developed country on Earth where this happens,"" he said,
""and it happens now once a week."" But as widely as the number spread, it also attracted criticism. Charles Johnson, who writes for the conservative Daily Caller, garnered attention for what he considered a debunking of the Everytown list. We decided to sift through the numbers ourselves. How Everytown counted 74 incidents To its credit, Everytown provided details on each of the 74 shootings, including the date, city and school location. The group also clearly laid out its methodology at the bottom of the list. These make it possible for the critics -- and us -- to look under the hood at its calculations. The main reason for the criticism of Everytown’s count is that its definition of ""school shooting"" is relatively broad. The group’s criteria goes beyond what many people would consider ""school shootings"" -- incidents in which a student or an intruder enters a school and fires at innocent students and staff. For many people, this is the first thing that comes to mind when they hear the phrase ""school shooting"" -- an incident such as Sandy Hook or, before it, the 1999 Columbine shooting in Colorado that left 15 dead, including the shooters. Here’s the methodology as explained by the group at the bottom of the list: Incidents were classified as school shootings when a firearm was discharged inside a school building or on school or campus grounds, as documented in publicly reported news accounts. This includes assaults, homicides, suicides, and accidental shootings. Incidents in which guns were brought into schools but not fired there, or were fired off school grounds after having been possessed in schools, were not included.... Incidents were identified through media reports, so this is likely an undercount of the true total. This definition allows for incidents that don’t typically call to mind the term ""school shooting"" -- for example, a case in which a man unaffiliated with Alogna High/Middle School in Iowa killed himself in the school’s parking lot in the middle of the night, or an early-morning armed robbery on a street that goes through the Marquette University campus in Wisconsin. Both count in Everytown’s tally. Clearly it is difficult to draw lines. The Everytown list did not include the recent and highly publicized shooting spree in Isla Vista, Calif. In that case, the shooter was a student at the University of California at Santa Barbara, and he targeted other students, including women living in a sorority house near the campus. Seven people died, but the shooting wasn’t technically on campus, so it didn’t make the list. Our Breakdown We reviewed news reports for all 74 shootings and did our best to sort them into five categories. Here’s our breakdown. (See individual shootings by category here, with clickable links to news reports on each shooting.) • Incidents such as Sandy Hook or Columbine in which the shooter intended to commit mass murder: 10 instances • Incidents related to criminal activity (such as drug dealing or robbery), or personal altercations: 39 instances • Incidents unconnected to members of school community and/or that took place outside school hours: 16 instances • Suicides: 6 instances • Accidental discharges: 3 instances In all, these 74 incidents resulted in 38 deaths and 53 injuries. The biggest death toll in one incident was a shooting spree that ended at Santa Monica College. Six people died, though not all of them took place on the campus. While the list includes a lot of gunfire, deaths and injuries, only about 14 percent were shootings that mirrored Columbine and Sandy Hook. In addition, almost half -- 35 -- occurred at a college or university rather than a K-12 school. This clashes with the imagery invoked by the line in the chart’s introduction, that ""we should feel secure in sending our children to school — comforted by the knowledge that they’re safe."" We asked James Fox, a criminology professor at Northeastern University, for some perspective. He pointed to the 2013 ""Indicators of School Crime and Safety"" report compiled by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. There were about 45 school-associated violent deaths (not just by guns) at elementary and secondary schools each year between the 1992 and 2010 school years, according to the report. The highest annual total was 63 deaths in 2006-07, while the lowest was 31 in 2010-11. In other words, Fox said, the number of gun deaths documented by Everytown over the past year and a half are not out of the ordinary. About 15 to 20 kids in grades K-12 are killed at school each year, along with a similar number of college students, he said. Is it misleading? The experts we consulted agreed that Everytown’s broad definition of ""school shooting"" could be misleading, encouraging them to assume that there have been 74 incidents similar to Columbine or Sandy Hook. While the Everytown definition is certainly one way of calculating it, there is such a range of motivations, degrees of planning and outcomes that it ceases to be an especially useful measurement, said Jay Corzine, a University of Central Florida sociology professor. Mark Safarik, president of Forensic Behavioral Services Inc. and a former member of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit, agreed that when the average person thinks of a school shooting, they think of a mass murder like Sandy Hook. ""There is an ocean of difference between Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech and Columbine and a depressed student who (commits suicide) at school, or an accidental discharge,"" Safarik said. ""To call them all school shootings may be true in a technical sense but is quite disingenuous on an emotional level, which is where they are trying to capture for their audience."" Everytown has countered the media criticism by arguing that focusing too closely on Sandy Hook-like incidents unfairly diminishes the full extent of the dangers to students and staff posed by guns in or near schools. ""The country's gun-violence epidemic has seeped into our children's schools, and that is a problem, regardless of the body count,"" said spokeswoman Erika Lamb. ""Those lives count, too, even if the media is only focused on mass tragedies."" Corzine prefers the designation used by the New York Police Department, among others -- ""active shooter,"" which limits the list to incidents that occur during school hours, involving a firearm discharged with the intent to kill or injure others on school grounds or while in transit on a school vehicle. In addition, Fox said the statistic is misleading for another reason -- it focuses on short-term patterns, rather than long-term trends. Despite the media focus, Fox said, it’s worth noting that the number of school-related homicides has remained relatively flat for two decades, he said. ""I don't mean to minimize the horror of these events or the pain and suffering of victims, but schools are safe, safer than other places that our children spend time,"" he said. ""For some kids, school is even safer than their home."" Corzine said he sees some value in Everytown’s calculations -- but also pitfalls. On the one hand, ""they are a valid indicator of the ease with which firearms enter the school environment in the United States compared to other highly developed nations."" By the same token, though, ""it is misleading to use the 74 school shootings in a context that explicitly or implicitly equates them with Sandy Hook."" Our ruling A statistic calculated by Everytown for Gun Safety, and shared widely on social media, said that there have been 74 ""school shootings in America since Sandy Hook."" The group’s figure is accurate only if you use a broad definition of ""school shooting"" that includes such incidents as suicides, accidents and spillover from adjacent criminal activity. The figure has some value in quantifying the proximity of guns to school campuses, but the group makes a significant stretch by tying the statistic so closely to the mass shooting at Sandy Hook. By doing this, the group closely associates the statistic with planned mass shootings targeting students and school staff -- a category that, using a more strict definition, accounts for only 10 of the 74 incidents. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

Did Americans invent the car? Ingraham says so
","Americans have a reputation for ingenuity -- but it can be tempting to give more credit than is deserved. In a recent radio show, conservative talk-radio host Laura Ingraham responded to a caller who noted that in some jobs, immigrants outperform Americans. Ingraham sought to reframe the issue. ""Americans won the war with our allies in World War II,"" Ingraham said. ""Americans developed some of the most groundbreaking pieces of technology that the world has ever seen. We invented the automobile. We invented the airplane. Americans can do those jobs."" There’s no doubt that the Wright brothers invented the airplane, and Henry Ford was a major player in making the car a global commercial success. But a listener to Ingraham's show was pretty sure that she was off the mark when she said Americans invented the automobile. The listener asked us to look into it, so we did. When we contacted University of Dayton automobile historian John Heitmann, he said the car’s roots are in Europe. ""The automobile is European by birth, American by adoption,"" Heitmann said. ""German inventors and French entrepreneurs led the way."" The first patent for an internal combustion powered car -- a two-seater -- was filed on Jan. 29, 1886 by Karl Benz in Germany.  Benz’s names lives on in the Mercedes-Benz brand. We also checked with John Lienhard, a professor of technology at the University of Houston. In a radio series on innovation, Lienhard said a few people actually built powered vehicles before Benz. For instance, Austrian engineer Sigfried Marcus invented the carburator for his first gas-powered car in 1864. Marcus built a second prototype sometime between 1875 and 1888. The car is owned today by the Austrian Automobile, Motorcycle and Touring Club in Vienna. Reportedly, it still runs. (A side note: When Nazi Germany annexed Austria, the Nazis tried to expunge all records of Marcus because he was Jewish. His car was hidden behind a false brick wall and ""re-discovered"" in 1949. Like a scene out of the Woody Allen movie Sleeper, it started up and was driven at the break-neck speed of about 3 mph.) Steam-powered cars date back even earlier -- to 1769 in France. Lienhard told PunditFact he shudders at having to figure out the question of who was ""first,"" since the path to what we know today as the car included many zig-zags, incremental improvements and dead ends. He wrote a book, How Invention Begins, about the many efforts that ultimately produced the car we know today. Still, he offered a rule of thumb: Look at who had the first commercial success. By that standard, the nod goes to Benz. ""He built a little three-wheeled car in 1885 and sold his first one two years later,"" Lienhard wrote. ""He went into production with a four-wheeled model in 1890."" We should note that America was not too far behind Benz. According to the University of Michigan’s Bentley Historical Library, William Morrison constructed an electric carriage that he drove through Des Moines, Iowa, in 1891. In 1893, Frank Duryea exhibited a motorized truck, using an internal combustion engine. The first sales to the American public took place in 1896. ""Once we got into the game, we moved very fast,"" Lienhard said. ""Our role in the development of the automobile was huge."" Ingraham show producer Julia Hahn told us Ingraham was thinking of Americans’ early work in engine design. Our ruling Ingraham said that Americans invented the automobile. If we look at internal combustion-powered vehicles, all of the first examples come from Europe, and the first commercial enterprise emerged in Germany. America played a major role in automobile production, but Ingraham spoke specifically about an earlier stage -- invention.

Van de Putte, affirming Texas-Mexico trade ties, draws on outdated figure
","The Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor of Texas questioned whether Republican nominee Dan Patrick understands the linked economies of neighboring Texas and Mexico. In a June 1, 2014, interview on MSNBC’s ""Up With Steve Kornacki,"" state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte of San Antonio said she might ask voters to consider Patrick’s personal debts related to his bankruptcy in the 1980s. More than that, she said, ""it’s the direction that he would bring this state. If really he’s such a great businessman, how come he doesn’t realize that our trade with Mexico is $720 million a day? That’s our No. 1 trading partner. Yet he chooses to demean and insult the people who live ... in the border areas, that are such a vibrant part of our economy."" Patrick, a Houston state senator, can speak for himself on what he knows about trade and the border region. We wondered how Van de Putte reached her $720 million-a-day statement and the declaration of Mexico as the state’s No. 1 trading partner. Emmanuel Garcia, a Texas Democratic Party spokesman, responded on Van de Putte's behalf, saying by email the senator drew on a Feb. 26, 2013, news article in the Austin Business Journal and a report, last updated in May 2014, from Gov. Rick Perry’s office stating Mexico was the state's No. 1 trading partner in 2013. The article, describing a meeting of the Texas House Committee on International Trade and Intergovernmental Affairs, said trade ""between Texas and Mexico is worth $720 million a day, according to the governor’s office."" We watched the House’s archived video of the hearing, which showed Amir Mirabi of the governor’s office telling the panel Texas accounts for $720 million a day, on average, in trade with Mexico. ""We’re in a very, very sweet spot that we need to maintain,"" Mirabi testified. Tricia Horatio, an aide to the committee chairman, state Rep. Rafael Anchia, D-Dallas, emailed us Mirabi’s presentation, which included a chart indicating Texas in 2011 accounted for $262 billion in imports from and exports to Mexico--or some $718 million in trade a day. The per-day figure becomes $720 million, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed told us by email, if one leaves out New Year's and Christmas Day ""when most Texas and Mexico sea/inland ports are closed."" Nashed said the 2013 presentation relied on ""port-level import data, which was the best available to us at the time."" But the governor no longer draws on port-level import data, she said, relying instead on U.S. Census Bureau breakdowns of each state’s imports and exports. Census bureau, here we come. And to our inquiry, Mala Mistry, a bureau statistician, provided a chart drawing on its import and export figures for Texas and Mexico. In 2013, according to the chart, Texas exported nearly $101 billion in goods to Mexico and imported nearly $95 billion worth. The total Texas-Mexico trade that year averaged about $539 million a day--up from $535 million in 2012 and $495 million in 2011--the year for which the governor’s office in testimony estimated $720 million a day in trade between the state and nation. Top Texas Trading Partners, 2013 (U.S. Census Bureau estimates) Source: U.S. Census Bureau, June 2014 We brought the bureau’s trade figures to Van de Putte’s attention. Garcia said by email that going forward, she will rely on that data to quantify Texas trade with Mexico. Our ruling Van de Putte said our ""trade with Mexico is $720 million a day; that’s our No. 1 trading partner."" In 2013, Mexico was by far the nation with the most trade with Texas. But Texas-Mexico trade per day added up to $539 million, nearly $200 million less than the 2011 estimate Van de Putte drew from a 15-month-old presentation by the governor’s office.

Act 10 has cut interest in teaching careers, Mary Burke says
","Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Mary Burke charges that Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s move to curtail collective bargaining for most public employees is hurting Wisconsin in the classroom. Burke, a Madison School Board member, argues the prospect of limited raises and costlier benefits under the Act 10 measure is turning people away from teaching. ""Already we have seen in Wisconsin fewer people pursuing education as a career,"" she said April 18, 2014 in a meeting with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporters and editors. She attributed the trend to Act 10, adding: ""We even see people certainly dropping out and saying, ‘I’m not sure I see a future in front of me in terms of pay and benefits where I’m going to be able to cover my student loans, be able to support myself and my family long term, and whether this is a profession that is going to be one that keeps good people.’"" As a candidate, Burke says she would have sought greater pension and health insurance contributions from public employees -- but at the bargaining table with unions. When asked to back up her claim, Burke spokesman Joe Zepecki offered statistics and anecdotal evidence. ""During the course of the campaign Mary has had the opportunity to speak with teachers, students and experts from across Wisconsin who have shared their concerns about staying in or joining the educational field, and what the impacts of fewer educators will be on the state economy,"" he said. Burke also cited a December 2013 Wisconsin State Journal article. It reported two straight years of modest enrollment declines in UW-System undergraduate teacher education programs starting in 2011-12. That was the first full academic year after the enactment of Act 10 in early 2011. The total two-year enrollment drop was 2.9%, or 207 fewer students from a base of 7,166. In contrast, before 2011-12, the enrollment had risen 7% in two years.. We confirmed those figures and obtained new UW-System data showing the decline picked up steam in the most recent academic year, 2013-14. The three-year drop is 8.3 percent. Cause and effect Burke directly blamed Act 10 for the enrollment fall-off. But when we took a closer look at the numbers and interviewed leaders in teacher training, several problems emerged. First, the enrollment downturn was not just a Wisconsin phenomenon. Nationally, enrollment in teacher training programs dropped 8 percent in 2011-12 over the year before, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education. (The 2012-13 figures were not available as of June 10, 2014). Among neighboring states, Minnesota and Illinois saw double-digit downturns that year. Iowa and Michigan saw little change, but had seen major declines in 2010-11. All this strongly suggests broader forces at work. Second, the downturn in the UW-System’s undergraduate education-training enrollment is a long-term trend. Between 2003 and 2013, enrollment declined in eight of the 10 years, falling a total of 14 percent, or 1,110 students. The exception to that trend came in the uptick from 2008 to 2010, right before Act 10. Setting that aside, there’s an even bigger problem for Burke’s claim. The UW-System totals Burke cited as backup do not include thousands of students enrolled in education programs at more than 25 private colleges and universities, or those in alternative training programs not connected to higher education institutions. The federal Department of Education data covers all sources, and at first glance it helps Burke. It shows that in the post-Act 10 year, 2011-12 Wisconsin enrollment dropped 7% from the year before, from 11,780 to 10,998. But the decline actually started a year earlier, in the 2010 academic year -- six months before Act 10 even was proposed. All this makes it dicey at best to draw a straight line between Act 10 and enrollment drops. Leaders debate trends Cheryl Hanley-Maxwell, associate dean of the School of Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says applications are down there, but not enrollment. As for the recent drop-off in the broader UW-System, she told the State Journal in December and PolitiFact Wisconsin that it’s unclear what’s behind it. ""We have no way of attributing changes to Act 10,"" she told us. ""I don’t know that it’s Act 10."" The drop may prove an anomaly, Hanley-Maxwell said, or reflect the economic downturn, cutbacks in teacher positions and education courses, and a ""beat up on teachers"" attitude in today’s polarized political circles. Other experts mention the proliferation of costly exams and assessments that would-be teachers  face before getting a license. For a perspective on private and public schools, we spoke with Reid Riggle, an education professor at St. Norbert College. He’s led the Wisconsin Independent Colleges of Teacher Education and is president-elect of the Wisconsin Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, which includes public and private schools. At St. Norbert’s, enrollment has fallen significantly in his introductory education classes, and he wonders if it’s the economy, a need for more scholarships or other factors. ""We are in a trough right now,"" Riggle said. ""It doesn’t mean we won’t get out of the trough or that Act 10 was the cause."" Riggle told us the reduced financial security caused by the Walker legislation makes it less desirable to be a Wisconsin teacher than it was prior to Act 10. But he added: ""It is difficult to clearly provide specific numbers on the impact of Act 10."" A final note about enrollment in master’s level continuing education courses taken by existing teachers. Those students were not part of our analysis because Burke’s claim and her evidence centered on undergraduates trying to get their initial license. It’s worth noting, though, that a gradual decline in master’s level enrollment in education has accelerated dramatically since Act 10. Melanie Agnew, UW-Whitewater’s education dean and president of the Wisconsin Association of Colleges of Teacher Education, joined others in attributing that dropoff to Act 10, which allowed school districts to discontinue giving salary credit for higher education courses and degrees. Our rating Burke claimed that, ""Already in Wisconsin we have seen fewer people pursuing education as a career"" due to the Act 10 collective bargaining law. There’s an element of truth here, in that enrollment has declined since Act 10’s adoption. But that correlation doesn’t prove that Act 10 caused the drop. In fact, the Wisconsin trend predates Act 10 and coincides with a national drop in students in teacher training. And education-school leaders offer a host of other possible explanations for the fall-off. We rate Burke’s claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/13/mary-burke/act-10-has-cut-interest-teaching-careers-mary-burk/

Hillary Clinton says in memoir that there's very little U.S. military presence in Africa
","Let’s be honest: When Hillary Clinton announced she was writing a memoir on her four years as Secretary of State, everyone had one question. What would she say about the deadly 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya? As it turns out, Clinton did not disappoint — at least on that topic. While critics have called the book a bit of a snoozer, the chapter on Benghazi is one of the longest in Hard Choices. The book explains what happened and how the State Department reacted — and offers a full-throated rebuke of Republican criticisms. In defending the United States’ response to the attack, one of the factors Clinton noted was that there’s a gap between popular perceptions about the country’s military capabilities and the reality. ""Critics have questioned why the world’s greatest military force could not get to Benghazi in time to defend our people,"" Clinton said. ""Part of the answer is that, despite having established United States Africa Command in 2008, there just wasn’t much U.S. military infrastructure in place in Africa. Unlike in Europe and Asia, the U.S. military footprint in Africa is nearly nonexistent."" Since Libya is located on the Mediterranean Sea, on Africa’s northern coast, Clinton’s claim that the U.S. military is ""nearly nonexistent"" in Africa is pretty consequential to the debate. In 2007, President George W. Bush announced that the United States would create a singular African command responsible for military operations throughout the continent. Prior to its creation, jurisdiction over Africa was split between combat headquarters in the Pacific, European and Middle East regions. The motivation for the change was that Pentagon planners argued that terrorism and extremism spread more easily in countries with weak governments and poor citizens susceptible to ideological messaging. In creating what would become known as AFRICOM, the U.S. hoped to improve its own security by partnering with developing countries in Africa to better handle their own security concerns and avoid another Afghanistan. Pentagon officials also thought, however, that a large U.S. military presence in these countries could become counterproductive, offering propaganda opportunities for terrorists and breeding anti-American sentiments, said Joseph Siegel, the director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies at the National Defense University. The goal all along, he said, was to have a ""light footprint."" Instead of a large scale operation, small groups would work with African countries in training African troops to handle the unique security issues within their own borders. ''Bases? Garrisons? It's not about that,'' then-Africa Commander Gen. William E. Ward of the Army told the New York Times when AFRICOM opened in 2008. ''We are trying to prevent conflict, as opposed to having to react to a conflict."" How small was the presence? A spokesman for Clinton told PolitiFact that AFRICOM is not even based in Africa. Its headquarters are in Germany, where about 1,500 of its 2,000 personnel — troops, civilians and contractors — are located. There’s very little military infrastructure or advanced weaponry and warships. Of the Department of Defense’s annual budget of $520 billion, the Africa Command accounted for just $275 million in 2012. An AFRICOM spokesman noted that Europe — geographically one-third the size of Africa -- has 12 times the number of U.S. troops. Even smaller countries like Afghanistan and South Korea have five times the U.S. forces than all of Africa does. ""It’s the smallest of the commands in resources and personnel, and to my knowledge it controls very few assets that it would deploy on its own,"" Siegel said. There is one U.S. military base on the continent — Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, a country in the African Horn. Between 2,000 and 4,000 personnel are typically stationed there. That includes some troops, but many of those individuals are contractors or military personnel who are there to run base operations, said Larry Hanauer, a senior international policy analyst at RAND Corporation, a think tank. ""We do not have combat aircraft permanently based in Africa,"" Hanauer said. ""There are transportation aircraft in Camp Lemonnier,"" but not fighter jets. Even if Camp Lemonnier had those resources, Djibouti is some 2,000 miles away from Benghazi. Points in Europe are much closer, such as Rome, which is about 800 miles away. At the time of the attacks, AFRICOM had to borrow an emergency response force from Europe Command because it did not yet have one. According to a New York Times article, the Africa Command did not have a gunship or armed drones. Asked whether he thought Clinton’s statement was accurate, RAND’s Hanauer said, ""I think it’s more accurate than not."" Siegel of National Defense University agreed that it was a ""fair statement."" So did Michael O'Hanlon, a director of research for the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. ""Hillary's right. The headquarters is in Germany and our total military force on the continent is a total of a few thousand at most dispersed in various small locations, not operational bases."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""the U.S. military footprint in Africa is nearly nonexistent."" There is a military presence in Africa, but it’s limited to one base with little combat infrastructure, and it’s commanded from a location that is not even located on the continent. That’s by design; the command’s planners sought to create a preventive, collaborative force rather than one that was heavily armed. Experts we interviewed took little issue with the overall impression of her comment, particularly as it describes the United States’ challenges in responding to a crisis in north Africa.

Wisconsin law prohibits anyone who knows about a secret John Doe investigation from talking about it, Gov. Scott Walker says
","As questions surfaced about whether Gov. Scott Walker is trying to settle a secret John Doe criminal investigation involving his campaign, he has suggested that state law prohibits him from commenting on the case. That’s what happened on the June 1, 2014 edition of ""Upfront with Mike Gousha,"" a weekly public affairs program aired on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee and on five other Wisconsin stations. Gousha asked the Republican governor if an attorney representing Walker and his campaign committee has been negotiating with the John Doe special prosecutor to reach a settlement. Walker gave this response: ""As you know, as I've pointed out many times in the past when we've talked about this, the law's pretty clear in this state,"" Walker said. ""Anyone who knows anything about a John Doe can't talk about it. Anyone who doesn't know anything about it shouldn't talk about it. So, I've not commented on the Doe itself because I've abided by the law."" Walker has made similar statements in the past, leading many to ask whether the secrecy part of the law in fact is so broad -- particularly given that others have disclosed details of the ongoing probe in the press and in public court filings.    What is a John Doe? Here's a John Doe primer, based on an article for the State Bar of Wisconsin by Madison criminal defense attorney Marcus Berghahn, who has represented clients in John Doe investigations: A John Doe is ""intended as an independent, investigatory tool to ascertain whether a crime has been committed and, if so, by whom."" Unlike standard criminal investigations, law enforcement officials in a John Doe have special powers, including the power to compel the testimony of reluctant witnesses under oath and to issue subpoenas requiring witnesses to turn over documents. Another key difference is that the judge overseeing a John Doe can -- and typically does -- order that the proceedings be done in secret, unlike the vast majority of court proceedings. The governor has been connected to two John Doe investigations. In May 2010, when Walker was the Milwaukee County executive, Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat, launched what would become a nearly three-year-long John Doe targeting Walker’s aides and associates. Six people, including three county executive employees, one county appointee and a major campaign contributor, were convicted of a variety of crimes. In August 2012, weeks after Walker won an historic recall election to remain in office, Chisholm opened another secret John Doe. It has focused on whether the Wisconsin Club for Growth and other conservative groups illegally coordinated with Walker's campaign. Eric O'Keefe of Wisconsin Club for Growth has openly defied the secrecy order, going public with the fact that he has been subpoenaed. Now, to Walker's claim, made in connection with the second Doe -- that under Wisconsin law, ""anyone who knows anything about a John Doe can't talk about it."" It’s worth noting that Walker’s ""anyone who knows anything"" phrasing is open to interpretation. At one extreme, a person could know something about a John Doe case by hearing about it in the news. That, of course, is much different than knowing about a Doe by virtue of being a participant in it. What the law says Asked to back up Walker's statement, a spokeswoman for the governor’s office referred our questions to Walker’s campaign, and a campaign spokeswoman declined to offer any information to back Walker’s claim. Walker’s attorney in the John Doe, former U.S. Attorney Steven Biskupic, didn't return our call. We contacted seven experts, all of whom have handled multiple John Doe cases: Berghahn and Madison defense attorneys Stephen Morgan and Stephen Meyer; Milwaukee defense attorneys Jeremy Levinson, who also handles campaign finance cases for Democrats, and Raymond Dall’Osto; University of Wisconsin Law School professor David Schultz and Marquette University Law School professor Daniel Blinka. Meyer and Berghahn are also adjunct professors at the UW Law School. Morgan and Blinka are former prosecutors. Here's what we learned about the state’s John Doe law, in terms of Doe cases done in secret: 1. Secrecy applies when so ordered As we noted, John Doe investigations can be done in public, but the Doe law allows judges to hold them in secret. And many do. When the secrecy provision is invoked, individuals who are ordered by a John Doe judge not to disclose information about a Doe investigation are prohibited from doing so. At minimum, witnesses, attorneys and others who participate in the secret court proceedings are prohibited from disclosing anything that was said in court, or anything, such as documents or other evidence, shown in the closed court proceeding. Judges have also issued broader secrecy prohibitions. For example, people who receive a subpoena to produce documents might be ordered not to disclose to anyone but their attorney the fact that they were subpoenaed, nor what information the subpoena seeks. 2. Secrecy doesn’t apply to ""anyone"" There is no blanket prohibition that applies to anyone who has some knowledge about a John Doe. For example, anyone who hears information second-hand about a Doe is not prohibited from talking about it. 3. A gray area Our experts disagreed on whether the John Doe law prohibits a person from commenting on any possible settlement negotiations. Some felt any secrecy order would not apply because settlement negotiations would be done in, for example, a lawyer’s office, apart from the secret proceedings in court. However, other experts said a secrecy order could apply to commenting on the existence of settlement negotiations because such negotiations could be the subject of discussion during the secret courtroom proceedings. Our rating Asked whether his lawyer was in negotiations to settle a John Doe criminal investigation, Walker said that under Wisconsin law, ""anyone who knows anything about a John Doe can't talk about it."" A person who knows something about a John Doe by virtue of participating in the secret court proceedings -- if they are individually ordered by a judge not to disclose anything about the proceedings -- is prohibited from revealing such information. But the governor’s statement is overbroad in suggesting that anyone who knows any information about a John Doe can’t talk about it.

The country’s lawmakers banned alcohol at stadiums 11 years ago in effort to curb game-related violence. One problem: Budweiser, famous for its beer, is a major sponsor of the 2014 FIFA World Cup being held in Brazil. So something had to give. And according to comedian John Oliver, it was the alcohol ban. ""The amazing thing is here FIFA won. They successfully pressured Brazil into passing a so-called Budweiser bill, allowing beer sales in soccer stadiums,"" Oliver said June 8 on his HBO show Last Week Tonight. ""And at this point you can either be horrified by that or relieved that FIFA was not also sponsored by cocaine and chainsaws."" We decided to investigate the brewhaha. FIFA spokeswoman Delia Fisher said ""there is no Budweiser bill,"" though ""it’s true that at the World Cup we will be able to sell beer, and that was part of our requirements."" Brazil knew about FIFA’s requirements when it bid to host the World Cup, she said. Indeed, Budweiser and Brahma, owned by Belgian-Brazilian company Anheuser-Busch InBev, are on tap and will be sold in plastic cups at matches, she said. So what happened? Oliver’s research team sent us many news stories to back up his claim, including a January 2012 CNN International story highlighting the controversy and comments from FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke. ""Alcoholic drinks are part of the FIFA World Cup, so we’re going to have them,"" Valcke said in January 2012. ""Excuse me if I sound a bit arrogant, but that's something we won't negotiate."" Valcke was also irritated about the country’s all-around lack of progress for the tournament. His comments, in turn, outraged Brazilians two years ago, with leaders at one point refusing to meet with him. Slowly and controversially, FIFA got what it wanted. A World Cup-related bill passed Brazil’s Senate in May 2012 and President Dilma Rousseff signed it into law in June 2012. Rousseff announced a temporary amendment that allowed beer to be sold at the World Cup and also the Confederations Cup in 2013. The bill that passed actually did not explicitly authorize beer sales at the matches, but government leaders said it allowed Brazil to lift the alcohol ban during the World Cup month, per FIFA’s demand. One senator explained the law simply ratified what the executive branch had already done by agreeing to FIFA’s requirements when it bid for the Cup, according to an Associated Press account. In short, the bill that passed in Brazil set the guidelines for hosting the World Cup. And by not including a ban on alcohol, alcohol effectively is permitted. Oliver referred to the measure as a ""so-called Budweiser bill,"" but we did not find that characterization widely spread in news stories in a Nexis search, though the connection is unmistakable. His research team pointed to the phrase used in a New Zealand study of alcohol consumption at sporting events (referring to FIFA’s lobbying in Brazil over beer) and also on a blog called Left Foot Forward. This probably won’t be the last time we hear about a country bending its alcohol prohibitions to please FIFA. Similar stadium bans exist in Russia, host of the 2018 World Cup, and Qatar, the small Middle Eastern country that will host in 2022. Our ruling Oliver called out FIFA for having ""pressured Brazil into passing a so-called Budweiser bill, allowing beer sales in soccer stadiums."" There is no doubt that FIFA demanded beer be allowed to be sold at this summer’s World Cup, and that it was part of an agreement to host the World Cup in the first place. That fits a typical definition of pressure. Oliver took a bit more creative license in calling it the ""so-called Budweiser bill,"" but the characterization does not diminish Oliver’s overall point.

Hillary Clinton says in Iran in 1979, extremists hijacked a broad-based, popular revolution against the Shah
","Befitting her previous position as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton’s new book, Hard Choices, ranges across the globe, occasionally looking back into history long before she took the helm at the State Department. For instance, Clinton writes that ""in Iran in 1979, the extremists hijacked the broad-based popular revolution against the Shah and established a brutal theocracy."" We had always closely associated the Iranian Revolution with Islamic fundamentalism. Was Clinton’s summary correct? We checked in with several scholars who have studied the region, and their consensus was that Clinton was broadly correct, despite a bit of oversimplification. First, some background. The revolution began in the late 1970s, amid simmering discontent among Iranians about Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the autocratic leader who operated a feared secret police. Even as he maintained generally (but not uninterrupted) good ties to the West, his standing at home was deteriorating. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, an exiled cleric living in Paris, courted support among critics of the Shah. After a series of strikes and protests, the Shah in January 1979 left for an ""extended vacation,"" never to return home. The handpicked leaders the Shah left behind tried to prevent Khomeini from forming a government, but after the cleric returned to Tehran in February 1979, unrest grew. In mid February, supporters of Khomeini declared a revolutionary state, and within two months, Khomeini won a national referendum. ""The strongest images of Iran's revolution come from those early years"" of 1979 to 1982, wrote Robin Wright in her 2000 book, The Last Great Revolution: Turmoil and Transformation in Iran. ""Many still linger in the minds of outsiders: The demonstrations by rifle-toting mullahs and chador-clad women. The morgue slabs with bullet-riddled bodies of officials from the monarchy and other loyalists who were summarily executed in the course of revolutionary justice. The seizure of the United States Embassy and 52 hostages who, over the next 444 days, were often paraded with crude blindfolds in front of cameras as effigies of Uncle Sam were burned in the background by angry youths. This was the delirium."" Largely lost in this popular image is the fact that the revolution’s supporters were not exclusively Islamist -- perhaps not even primarily Islamist. The Shah’s regime had made enemies of leftists, nationalists, intellectuals, democrats and the moderately religious. All of these groups, to one degree or another, were supporters of revolution against the Shah. Clinton ""is absolutely correct that the revolution of 1979 was a broad-based revolution against the Shah,"" said Mohsen M. Milani, executive director of the University of South Florida’s World Center for Strategic and Diplomatic Studies. ""In fact, it was one of the most popular revolutions of the modern era."" Gary Sick, an adjunct professor at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs and author of All Fall Down: America's Tragic Encounter With Iran and October Surprise: America's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan, agreed. ""The fact is that most of the millions of Iranians who took to the streets to oppose the Shah did not think they were going to replace him with a theocratic state,"" Sick said. ""That was the work of Khomeini and his followers, and it was actively opposed by many of the secular -- and even clerical -- revolutionaries."" Some of the historians we checked with took mild issue with the phrase ""hijacked,"" since Khomeini -- who for many Americans personifies Islamic extremism -- was always the central player in the revolution. After all, it’s hard to hijack a revolution you’d always led. But there’s an explanation for this paradox: Initially, Khomeini had openly stated that he was not pursuing a theocracy. ""Iran's emergence as a modern theocracy was never written in the heavens,"" Wright wrote in her book. ""Quite the contrary. In earlier pronouncements about a just government Ayatollah Khomeini actually said he didn't advocate clerical rule. … In one of his last interviews before leaving Paris, Ayatollah Khomeini told Le Monde, ‘Our intention is not that religious leaders themselves should administer the state.’ ""Once the tumultuous fanfare of his return died down, the Imam seemed almost uninterested in day-to-day government affairs. The ayatollah, already in his late seventies, instead went back to the dusty theological center of Qom. He seemed content to leave politics to the first revolutionary government of secular technocrats. His role was limited to settling disputes."" That changed with the effort to write Iran’s Constitution in the fall of 1979. ""Fearful that other changes might further marginalize or even exclude them, Ayatollah Khomeini's followers introduced a process to vet candidates' credentials -- a precedent that time and again allowed them to manipulate future elections, too,"" Wright wrote. ""It worked. They won a majority. And the final draft (of the constitution) ended up thoroughly Islamic."" Even then, the Islamic revolution wasn’t complete, Wright wrote: ""For the first presidential election in January 1980, a full year after the revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini decreed that no clerics could run for president -- further proof that he still didn't intend to establish a total theocracy. Over the next 18 months, however, Iran was wracked by bloodshed as the ruling clergy and their adjutants gradually eliminated former partners -- leftists, nationalists and intellectuals--from any claim to power."" Iran became fully Islamist in October 1981, when the cleric Ali Khamanei won the third presidential election -- the first election in which clerics were allowed to run. ""As of October 1981,"" Wright wrote, ""the mullahs were no longer only the supervisors and shadows of the state. They now dominated all its branches."" The experts we talked to quibbled slightly with Clinton’s claim, saying it’s a bit oversimplified. Notably, Clinton inaccurately compresses the time frame. The changes she’s talking about didn’t just happen immediately in 1979 but rather played out in an evolutionary fashion for two years after the Shah fell. ""If you have to do the whole history in 19 words, it's probably okay,"" said John Limbert, historian and political scientist at the U.S. Naval Academy and author of Iran: At War with History. Stephen Kinzer, a Boston University professor and author of the book, Reset: Iran, Turkey, and America’s Future, said Clinton is generally correct that ""the Iranian revolution was broad-based, and one faction later seized control, establishing a brutal theocracy."" Our ruling Clinton said that ""in Iran in 1979, the extremists hijacked the broad-based popular revolution against the Shah and established a brutal theocracy."" She’s generally correct, experts say, despite questions over whether ""hijacked"" is the right word and whether she used an overly broad time frame.

Rare feat: Cantor spent more at steakhouses than opponent did on campaign
","This might not quite be the stat heard round the world, but politicos could not resist passing along one factoid that seemed to capture the improbability of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor’s, R-Va., stunning defeat in his primary race against Dave Brat. ""Cantor's campaign spent more at steak houses than Brat spent on his entire campaign,"" said Chuck Todd, host of MSNBC’s The Daily Rundown. Talk about a claim made for headlines and Twitter. ""Eric Cantor: Burned at the steakhouse,"" said Rolling Stone magazine. ""High steaks politics"" and ""Where’s the beef"" popped up in the twittersphere. There’s no disputing the accuracy of the comparison, which first showed up in the New York Times. According to campaign finance data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics, Cantor spent $168,000 on fundraising events at three Virginia restaurants -- Bobby Van’s Grill, Bobby Van's Steakhouse, and Blt Steak. Brat spent a little less than $123,000 across the board for his campaign, according to the most recent campaign finance reports, which cover spending up until May 21, 2014. Overall, Cantor outspent Brat more than 40 to 1, according to available records, and still lost by 10 percentage points. There’s good reason for the collective astonishment -- this is a rare event. ""I can't think of any (case) in which the incumbent's spending advantage was so huge and he still lost,"" said Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California San Diego. Another political scientist, John Sides at George Washington University, has a database with about 9,100 House general election contests. Sides tracks which candidate won and which spent the most money. Being outspent was a clear disadvantage. ""In only 10 percent of races did the candidate who got outspent actually win,"" Sides said. Now, this concerns general elections, not primary contests like the one Cantor lost, but Sides said the pattern wouldn’t change much. Money is a very tangible perk that comes with incumbency. The Center for Responsive Politics calculated the odds of a challenger beating an incumbent going back to 1998. In the best year, 2006, challengers who spent $1 million or less, like Brat, had a 1 percent chance of winning. In every other election, their odds were much worse. Our ruling Todd said that Cantor spent more at steakhouses than Brat did in his entire campaign. The latest campaign finance reports back that up. Cantor spent $168,000 on steakhouse dinners to Brat’s $123,000 spent in the overall campaign.

Hillary Clinton says by 2009, U.S. drones had killed 'dozens' of senior terrorists
","In Hillary Clinton’s new memoir, Hard Choices, the former secretary of state defends the administration’s use of drone strikes in the face of knotty ethical and legal questions. In chapter 9 of the book, Clinton says drone strikes quickly became ""one of the most effective and controversial elements of the Obama Administration’s strategy against al Qaeda and like-minded terrorists."" She goes on to defend the careful planning of the strikes and their legal grounding, as well as their strategic value. But we were especially interested in one claim she made: ""President Obama would eventually declassify many of the details of the program and explain his policies to the world, but in 2009 all I could say was ‘no comment’ whenever the subject came up. Yet it was widely known that dozens of senior terrorists had been taken off the battlefield by drones, and we later learned that bin Laden himself worried about the heavy losses that drones were inflicting."" Is that correct? First, some background. Using armed unmanned aerial vehicles in combat is controversial because it pushes legal boundaries. (Here’s a previous fact-check in which we looked at this issue.) Of special concern is that drones have killed at least four American citizens on foreign soil. In defense of the program, officials often praise its effectiveness in hampering terrorist organizations. Tallying up the number of drone strikes is challenging, for obvious reasons -- they are done with tight secrecy. Although breaking down this data is difficult to do as a layperson, experts we checked with suggest that the claim that U.S. drone strikes have killed ""dozens"" of senior terrorists may well be an understatement. ""Hillary Clinton’s statement is 100 percent correct,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""That’s a conservative estimate."" There are no definitive lists of drone strikes or casualties they cause, but an analysis by the New America Foundation, a think tank, found that as of 2013, drones have killed about 58 known militant leaders in Pakistan and 35 in Yemen. In just those two countries, drones have killed between 2,861 and 4,452 people in all -- civilians and unknowns, in addition to militants, according to the foundation’s study. (Pakistan and Yemen are the locations of the majority of United States drone strikes, though attacks have also occurred in Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Philippines.) Clinton, though, uses the ""dozens"" number to refer to senior terrorists killed through 2009. A look through another non-governmental database -- created by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a philanthropically funded investigative-journalism project based in the United Kingdom -- appears to provide support for Clinton’s claims. We sifted through the project’s aggregated news reports about confirmed and suspected U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia, where the U.S. primarily sends drones to target members of al-Qaida and its affiliates. We searched for reported deaths of terrorists and militants described as ""senior,"" ""leader"" or ""commander"" through the end of 2009. Under these reasonably restrictive conditions, we found roughly three dozen top terrorists killed. Looking just at articles compiled by the Washington Post, we come up with at least two dozen. This number is nowhere near definitive, since it includes several deaths that are disputed. On the other hand, the number could be higher since it doesn’t include information from unreported strikes or strikes in Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq or Philippines. Despite these caveats, a conservative analysis of the evidence does suggest a factual basis for Clinton’s claim. A final note: Clinton also appears to be right about bin Laden being concerned about drones. A trove of letters found at Osama bin Laden’s compound after his 2011 death reveal that he was concerned about America’s drone use. In an October 2010 letter, he revealed that he was particularly worried about attacks in Waziristan, a region of Afghanistan. ""I am leaning toward getting most of the brothers out of the area,"" he wrote. ""We could leave the cars because they are targeting cars now, but if we leave them, they will start focusing on houses and that would increase casualties among women and children. It is possible that they have photographed targeted homes. The brothers who can keep a low profile and take the necessary precautions should stay, but move to new houses on a cloudy day."" Our ruling Clinton said that ""dozens of senior terrorists had been taken off the battlefield"" by drones. While it’s difficult to find a definitive number just using publicly available evidence, even a conservative estimate using credible accounts is enough to rate her claim True.",/factchecks/2014/jun/11/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-2009-us-drones-had-killed-doz/

John Oliver says a new soccer stadium for the World Cup will just be used for four games
","The eyes of international soccer fans are trained on Brazil, the country hosting the World Cup that kicks off Thursday. There is excitement for the month-long tournament played every four years. But in Brazil, there is also unrest. Disappointed Brazilians are protesting the country’s spending of more than $11 billion on infrastructure upgrades and stadiums to get ready for the tournament, with games spread across 12 cities in a country larger than the continental United States. Another sore spot is the role of soccer’s governing body, the Federation Internationale de Football Association, or FIFA, which chose Brazil as the host country and will reap most of the profits from the mega event. Soccer fan and comedian John Oliver, host of HBO’s Last Week Tonight, sought to illuminate soccer’s dark side in his June 8 show. One project that epitomizes World Cup waste, he argued, is a new 42,000-seat stadium in a city within the Amazon rainforest that cost the country more than $300 million to build. The city of Manaus is way, way, way off the beaten path. To emphasize how out of the way it is, Oliver pulled a TV news clip describing how stadium materials were shipped by boat from Portugal across the Atlantic Ocean and up the Amazon River. ""Okay, that does seem like a waste of money, especially when you consider that that stadium is only going to be used for four World Cup games,"" Oliver said. ""There’s also no team in Manaus that can fill it afterwards, at which point it becomes the world’s most expensive bird toilet."" We wanted to explore whether the stadium’s only real purpose is four World Cup games. FIFA requires eight venues for the tournament’s 64 matches, but Brazil selected 12 host cities. What seemed like an opportunity to share development, tourism and growth has posed logistical and financial problems around the country. Citing unfinished roads, stadiums and work areas, the mayor of Rio de Janeiro admitted ""we made a mistake"" in choosing a dozen hosts. Manaus, located in the northwestern Brazilian state of Amazonas, may be the most peculiar choice. The historic city of 2 million attracts business from electronics and oil industries thanks to its status as a free economic zone. Still, it’s mostly accessible by boat and air, nestled near the famous ""Meeting of the Waters,"" where the black Rio Negro and muddy Amazon meet but do not mix. Getting a World Cup-ready stadium ready in Manaus was an enormous feat, generating attention from the the Miami Herald, The New York Times, The Telegraph, the Los Angeles Times and Canada’s CBC News, to name a few. An existing stadium with just 20,000 seats had to be torn down in order to build a stadium that meets FIFA regulations. Its replacement, the German-designed Arena Amazonia, looks like a giant woven straw basket, the seats inside painted in shades of tropical fruit. The project got off to a slow start, and three men died during construction and there are questions whether the playing surface will be in decent shape. As Oliver said, it will host just four games -- the first on June 14 between England and Italy. The U.S. team will face Portugal there June 22. The other matches are Cameroon vs. Croatia and Honduras vs. Switzerland. So what’s next after the four World Cup matches? Manaus is not home to a top-tier Brazilian soccer team that might sustain big crowds when the World Cup is gone. The Miami Herald reported nonspecific plans for the stadium to host guest matches between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo teams. A local team in the country’s fourth soccer division, Nacional Futebol Clube, plans to play in the stadium when the World Cup ends. But a report from the Telegraph, and others, highlights low attendance figures of up to 1,000 fans for the team’s games. The Manaus stadium seats 42,000 people. ""We were careful with our wording to say that there is no ‘team in Manaus that can fill it afterwards’ — not to say that no one was going to play in it afterwards,"" reads a statement from the show’s research team via an HBO spokeswoman. ""We knew that there are plans to use the stadium for other purposes, too, and that some people hope the stadium will bring increased popularity to the Nacional team. ""But we felt like we were justified to have a deep skepticism about those claims, especially given the cost just to maintain the facility — and we felt we were on safe ground to word the joke the way we had it."" This stadium is not the only project deemed by some as a ""white elephant."" Brazilian soccer star-turned-congressman Romário told the New York Times in 2013 that new stadiums in Manaus, Cuiaba and Natal ""are absurd."" ""There will be a couple games there and then what? Who will go? It is an absolute waste of time and money,"" he said. FIFA spokeswoman Delia Fisher stressed that the government owns the stadium, not FIFA, and there are plans to ""privatize"" it after the World Cup. FIFA’s website says the stadium in Manaus ""will continue to attract tourists after the tournament by hosting concerts and cultural events."" The 2016 Olympics will also be in Brazil, but the soccer matches and other Olympic events will take place in the host city of Rio de Janeiro or surrounding cities, a four-hour flight to the south and east from Manaus. Our ruling Oliver said Brazil built a $300 million stadium in the Amazon rainforest that ""is only going to be used for four World Cup games,"" and there’s no team ""that can fill it afterwards."" His point is accurate. There are hopes and dreams for the stadium’s life when the World Cup is over, and locals hope it spurs more interest in local soccer teams in Manaus and can be used for big-ticket concerts and conferences. But the stadium, based on what we know, largely will sit unused. We rate Oliver’s claim True.",/factchecks/2014/jun/11/john-oliver/john-oliver-says-new-soccer-stadium-world-cup-will/

Robin Vos says Milwaukee is furloughing police officers at a time when violence is happening across the city
","In the wake of the May 21, 2014 shooting on a Milwaukee playground that left a 10-year-old girl gravely wounded, a familiar debate rekindled: Are there enough cops are on the street? In a May 30, 2014 appearance on WTMJ-AM radio, state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos told host Charlie Sykes that ""systemic problems"" led to such incidents, including the use of plea bargains, lenient judges and diverting resources from controlling crime. Vos also argued Mayor Tom Barrett and Police Chief Ed Flynn should be held accountable: ""Remember, in the city of Milwaukee we’ve still got a mayor and a police chief who are furloughing police officers at a time when we have violence all across the city."" So is Vos right? Are cops being kept off the street? When we asked Vos for backup, his office cited news accounts, city budget documents and testimony from Milwaukee Police Association president Michael Crivello at a Sept. 19, 2013 meeting of the city Fire and Police Commission. Under Barrett, the city began using the unpaid days off for all staffers in 2009 to address budget issues. Police officers have been involved, to varying degrees, since the practice began. City officials maintain that furloughs have been used selectively, at least when they come to cops. For instance, in the first year ""only a limited number of MPD sworn staff was required to have furloughs,"" said Mark Nicolini, the city’s budget director. Furloughs expanded to all officers in 2010. There were no furlough days for sworn staff in 2011 or 2012. Furloughs returned in 2013, when all police department staff took three days. The same number was included in the 2014 budget. To be sure, the furloughs are not a product of the mayor and police chief alone. The Fire and Police Commission unanimously approved the 2014 plan at a Sept. 19, 2013 meeting. And the Common Council voted 15-0 in favor of the furloughs, which for the police would save a projected $1.75 million, according to the city’s budget office. Savings from all city employees is expected to be $3.3 million. Furloughs and safety According to the Barrett administration and Police Department, the furloughs have little impact. Here’s what the city’s furlough policy says: ""Furloughs for furlough-eligible personnel in the Fire and Police Departments are to be scheduled in a manner designed to minimize the disruption to department operations and public safety."" Flynn’s spokesman, Lt. Mark Stanmeyer, said in an email: ""Furloughs have no impact on the minimum staffing levels set and maintained by MPD."" ""The operational impact of furloughs is that it becomes slightly more difficult for an officer to receive permission to use a compensatory day, vacation day, holiday or other contractually accrued leave time.  In order to mitigate this impact, furloughs are scheduled throughout the entire year."" Crivello, the union president, told the commission that he opposes furloughs ""due to public safety, police safety, morale, and lack of documentation illustrating other means of budgetary relief."" Asked in an interview about the city’s claim that furloughs don’t affect minimum staffing, Crivello did some basic math. With about 1,600 cops forced to take three days off, ""that’s 4,800 man days we’re losing to furloughs,"" he said. ""That means that every day there are 13 to 14 officers that are not on the street."" He said the furloughs affect officer safety because they contribute to fewer two-man squad cars, and reduce response time for when officers call for backup assistance. Crivello also said furloughs also hurt morale. Our rating Vos said the mayor and police chief were furloughing police officers. But Vos places the blame for them solely on Barrett and Flynn, when the responsibility is shared by the council and Fire and Police Commission.  What’s more, it’s a longstanding practice to deal with budget issues and steps have been taken to mitigate the impact on public safety.

GOP misfires on Carter claim
","Death and taxes have nothing on the inevitability of attack ads during election season. And since we live in Georgia – where an Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll in May found that 86 percent of voters see a candidate’s stance on the Affordable Care Act as a very important factor in their vote – it was another certainty that the federal health care overhaul also known as Obamacare would get prime billing. Enter ""Bad Idea,"" a Republican Governors Association ad against Jason Carter, the Democratic state senator locked in a tight race against Gov. Nathan Deal. It opens with claims that health care premiums will increase under the law before asking why Carter would say expanding the Medicaid program to more low-income Georgians ""should be on the table."" Then, the hammer: ""And why would Jason Carter support using Georgia tax dollars to promote Obamacare?"" it asks. Carter’s staff disagrees with that assessment, saying his vote on an anti-Obamacare bill was about information, not taxpayer money. And that’s exactly the sort of conflict that sets the PolitiFact Truth-O-Meter aquiver. Jon Thompson, the RGA’s press secretary, pointed us to House Bill 943, which bars state or local government employees from advocating for the Affordable Care Act and prevents creation of a state-run health insurance exchange. It also prohibits the use of state or local money to hire people to help Georgians sign up for coverage under the law. Carter was among 17 senators who voted against the measure, 16 of them Democrats. ""This law says we will not use our resources to implement a federal policy that our state disagrees with,"" said state Rep. Edward Lindsey, R-Atlanta. Lindsey wrote the amendment that watered down a previous bill, House Bill 707, that aimed to bar any state or local government agency from using money or resources to implement, not just promote, Obamacare. ""Essentially, it is a statement from Georgia,"" Lindsey added. William Custer, the director of the Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University, notes that Obamacare remains the law of the land, though. Even in Georgia. Even with House Bill 943. To that end, the bill as passed mostly prohibits what Georgia already didn’t plan to do – Deal had previously said he would not set up a state-run health exchange – and limits speech by public employees on taxpayers’ time, Custer said. ""It’s certainly reasonable that a person could vote no on that because of First Amendment concerns or objection to the state telling local government what to do,"" he said. ""As such, it was a message law. "" Carter read the restrictions in the bill as banning Georgia from accepting federal dollars, not using state dollars, to help explain the overhaul to constituents, said his spokesman, Bryan Thomas. ""Whatever anyone’s opinion on Obamacare, it’s a huge change to federal health care law,"" Thomas said. ""(Carter) voted no because this bill prevented state and local government agencies from helping people understand that massive change."" Carter did not issue a public statement to that end on the day of the vote, Day 39 of the 40-day session. In fact, he has remained mostly noncommittal about his thoughts on Obamacare in general as well as specific pieces of the law. That leaves his few statements open for interpretation – and political attack. This week, Carter told the AJC that expanding Medicaid would be one way to secure federal money to help keep rural hospitals open in the state. But Thomas, when asked whether Carter supports Medicaid expansion, said the candidate would also look at whether Georgia could get the same deal that Arkansas secured, to take new Medicaid money from the federal government to help the uninsured poor buy insurance on the private market. Thomas called it ""a false choice"" to answer yes or no if Carter would support Medicaid expansion as governor. ""It’s not a yes or no question,"" Thomas said. That kind of non-answer answer does Carter no favors. Mischaracterizing his stance isn’t hard to do when he won’t give clear answers to the policy questions on voters’ minds. In summary, though, it is still a stretch to conclude that Carter’s objection to one anti-Obamacare bill translates into support for spending state taxpayer money on the law. PolitiFact could not find any specific tax increase that Carter supported as a state senator, shoring up his office’s claims that it would be out of the norm for him to vote in favor of a measure if he believed it would increase taxes. But because Carter’s stance has been so fuzzy, it opens the door for interpretation about what he really believes.

""We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to piece together the resources for mortgages for houses, for Chelsea's education. It was not easy. Bill has worked really hard. And it's been amazing to me. He's worked very hard."" Republicans called the claim laughable and the next day Clinton clarified, again on ABC, that she and Bill had done very well over the past 14 years. ""We have a life experience that is clearly different in very dramatic ways from many Americans,"" Clinton said. ""But we also have gone through some of the same challenges many people have."" We wanted to take a closer look at Clinton’s claim of being ""dead broke"" when their time in the White House ended after December 2000. The Clintons’ balance sheet Clinton’s 2000 Senate financial disclosure form, via the Open Secrets website, provides a rough view of the balance between the couple’s assets and liabilities. These forms only show amounts in broad ranges -- from $15,001 to $50,000, from $50,001 to $100,000 and so forth -- but under any set of assumptions, the Clintons were in the red, a problem driven by Bill Clinton’s enormous legal bills. Their highest possible assets totaled about $1.8 million, while their lowest possible debts were nearly $2.3 million. The most optimistic scenario left them in a hole of about $500,000. But the federal disclosure form does not include homes used for personal use and the Clintons owned two. In 1999, they bought a five-bedroom home in Chappaqua, N.Y., for $1.7 million. In December 2000, just as they were leaving the White House, they bought a seven-bedroom house near Embassy Row in Washington, D.C. The price was $2.85 million. While those homes had mortgages, which would increase the amount of the Clintons' debt, the family also had equity in them. The New York Times reported that the Clintons put $855,000 down on the Washington house, for instance. That equity would have covered the low-end debt estimate of about $500,000. Point being: Clinton’s 2000 disclosure doesn’t prove the Clintons’ liabilities exceeded their assets when they left the White House. We reached out to Hillary Clinton’s office for more details and did not hear back. Were they dead broke? All this begs the question of whether someone who can afford to buy a $2.85 million house is ""dead broke."" We reached two accounting professors at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business, one of the top-ranked schools in the country. Assistant Professor Jeffrey Hoopes said to call the Clintons dead broke would be a stretch for how the term is commonly understood. ""Almost any president leaving office can expect tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars of future earnings as a result of their having been president,"" Hoopes said. ""Speaking, consulting, board positions, and so on, are all very lucrative."" Professor Brian Mittendorf said a balance sheet of assets and liabilities simply doesn’t paint a complete picture. Mittendorf compared the Clintons to a medical school graduate saddled with huge debts but with the prospect of a very hefty income down the line. ""While one can claim to be technically broke, creditors wouldn't take it as such as long as future income streams could cover the liabilities,"" Mittendorf said. In December 2000, at least one large bank saw the Clintons through that lens. Whatever their balance sheet might have been, Citibank lent them $1.995 million to buy that house in Washington, D.C. This was a safe loan. By Feb. 5, 2001, Bill Clinton was commanding regular speaking fees of $125,000 or more. Hillary Clinton herself did quite well in 2001. The book publisher Simon and Schuster paid her $2.84 million in royalties. By 2004, the Clintons had erased their debts and Hillary Clinton was ranked the 10th-wealthiest member of the Senate, with a net worth between $10 million and $50 million. Our ruling Hillary Clinton said she and Bill were in debt and dead broke when they left the White House. The public record shows that they possibly had more liabilities than assets, but it doesn’t show that conclusively. More important, a balance sheet does not tell the full story and the experts we reached said the Clintons’ earning potential had a real economic value that the financial sector traditionally acknowledges and is willing to bank on. A few weeks before they left the White House, the Clintons were able to muster a cash down payment of $855,000 and secure a $1.995 million mortgage. This hardly fits the common meaning of ""dead broke."" We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-she-and-bill-were-dead-broke/

In new book, Hillary Clinton touts quality-of-life advances in Afghanistan
","In her book, Hard Choices, Hillary Clinton writes about her experiences as secretary of state in the Obama administration. One of the most high-profile countries in her portfolio was Afghanistan, a country that the United States had invaded in 2001 in order to oust the Taliban. In the book, Clinton took some pride in Afghanistan’s accomplishments on her watch. ""By the time I left State, the Afghans had made progress,"" Clinton wrote. ""Economic growth was up and opium production was down. Infant mortality declined by 22 percent. Under the Taliban only 900,000 boys and no girls had been enrolled in schools. By 2010, 7.1 million students were enrolled, and nearly 40 percent of them were girls."" We decided to check the accuracy of her statistics. We used several sources, including the Brookings Institution’s periodic Afghanistan Index, which collects a wide range of data on the country, as well as information from the World Bank and the World Health Organization. (We won't be addressing whether she or the administration deserves credit for these improvements. The United States, as the major western military and diplomatic force in the country, clearly had an impact, but figuring out exactly how much is more art than science.) Is economic growth up? Given the multitude of challenges it faced, ranging from war to poverty, Afghanistan certainly could have done worse in economic growth than it did between 2009 and 2013. Here’s Afghanistan’s annual percentage increase in gross domestic product since 2000, according to the World Bank.   2000 ‘01 ‘02 ‘03 ‘04 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 7.3 7.0 2.9 5.7 1.1 11.2 5.6 3.7 3.6 21.0 8.4 6.1 14.4   According to this data, the country’s economic growth pattern has ranged widely, but it’s certainly been growing rather than shrinking. Still, lest anyone assume that the 14-percent-plus growth in 2012 -- Clinton’s last year as secretary of state -- is the new normal, the International Monetary Fund projected that Afghanistan would grow by a far slower 3.1 percent in 2013 (lower than any year since 2004) and 4.8 percent in 2014. Is opium production down? The Brookings study found that metric tons of opium production has also undergone a zigzagging course in recent years. Whether it declined depends on what time frame you’re looking at.   2002 ‘03 ‘04 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 3,400 3,600 4,200 4,100 6,100 8,200 7,700 6,900 3,600 5,800 3,700   The data show that opium production surged in 2006, peaked in 2007, and began falling in 2008 -- before Clinton became secretary of state. During her tenure, it went down, then up, then down again. Its 2012 level was roughly on par with the amount in 2002 and 2003. During Clinton’s four years, opium production averaged 5,000 metric tons per year. That’s slightly less than the average of the four years preceding her time as secretary of state. Has infant mortality declined? Mortality rates for children under 5 has indeed declined, at least according to the World Health Organization. Here’s the WHO’s data on infant mortality rate -- deaths from birth to age 1 per 1000 live births:   1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2012 120 102 94 83 74 71   The decline between 2005 and 2012 -- the closest we could get to a ""before and after"" for Clinton -- is a 14 percent decrease, a bit smaller than the 22 percent. Is school enrollment up sevenfold? This is the statistic for which Clinton seems most on-target -- and the one about which Afghan officials can feel most proud, assuming the data are accurate. Here are the enrollment figures in millions, according to the Brookings study:   2001 ‘02 ‘03 ‘04 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 ‘13 <1.0 2.0 3.0 3.7 4.7 5.2 5.6 5.9 6.5 7.1 8.3 9.0 10.0   So, for total enrollment, Clinton is exactly right. As for girls, the Brookings report says that ""virtually none"" of the students enrolled in 2001 were girls, a number that increased to roughly 40 percent by 2010. So she’s right about girls’ enrollment as well. Clinton is probably three-quarters accurate, said Michael O'Hanlon, a Brookings scholar who helped create the Afghanistan Index. ""The opium issue hasn’t been encouraging, but the other trend lines are all essentially what she writes,"" he said. Our rating Clinton said that over the course of her tenure as secretary of state, economic growth and school enrollment in Afghanistan was up, while opium production and infant mortality were down. Her claims about school enrollment, infant mortality, and economic growth are basically accurate, but the data on opium production suggests that her claim is somewhat exaggerated. We rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jun/10/hillary-clinton/new-book-hillary-clinton-touts-quality-life-advanc/
