False video says Pope Francis has coronavirus
","Pope Francis recently canceled some engagements after he was seen coughing and sneezing during an Ash Wednesday mass in Rome. The rare cancellations came as the coronavirus outbreak in Italy has infected more than 1,600 people, mostly in the northern region, and has people questioning whether the pope himself has contracted the virus. One YouTube video takes the rumor further by stating that the Vatican confirmed ""Pope Francis and two aides"" tested positive for the coronavirus. This isn’t true. There has been no official confirmation that the 83-year-old Catholic leader, or any of his aides, tested positive for the virus.  The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We could find no credible sources that say the pope — who lost part of a lung to an illness as a young man — was tested for the current coronavirus, or that he tested positive. The Vatican has repeatedly denied the claims and described his condition as a ""slight illness"" without giving more details. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni dismissed the coronavirus speculation, telling journalists that there’s ""no evidence that would lead to diagnosing anything but a mild indisposition."" The pope appeared at the Vatican Apostolic Palace window on March 1 to address thousands in St Peter’s Square in his first public appearance in days.

Donald Trump rewrites history about his ‘Russia, if you’re listening’ comment about Clinton's emails
","It was one of the most memorable quotes from the 2016 presidential campaign, and President Donald Trump said the media got it all wrong. In his Conservative Political Action Conference speech, Trump accused the media of being ""dishonest"" in its coverage of him inviting Russia to find Hillary Clinton’s emails in a July 2016 press conference.  ""Remember this thing, ‘Russia, if you're listening’?’ Remember, it was a big thing, in front of 25,000 people. ‘Russia if you're…’ It was all said in a joke,"" Trump said Feb. 29. ""They cut it off right at the end so that you don't then see the laughter, the joke. And they said, ‘He asked. He asked for help.’ Right?"" Trump continued:  ""Russia, if you're listening… A very famous — they cut that thing so quick at the end because they didn't want to hear the laughter in the place and me laughing. It was just ‘boom.’ These are really dishonest people."" Just like at the 2019 CPAC, where he used a similar line, Trump was not being honest about what happened July 27, 2016, at his Doral, Fla., resort.   RELATED: Hillary Clinton claims Donald Trump invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to hack Americans Trump’s retelling made it sound like the Russia line happened at a big rally with ""25,000 people."" But it emerged during a one-hour press conference at his Doral resort. Trump talked about Clinton’s emails several times, and at no point did he indicate he was joking. (That excuse was televised the next day.) ""Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump told a roomful of TV cameras and reporters (including this fact-checker). ""I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let’s see if that happens."" Trump delivered his comment (around minute 13:30 on the C-SPAN video) with a straight face. We didn’t hear any laughter after what he said; it was news. The Q&A continued with Trump calling on a reporter who asked about the minimum wage.  In the same press conference, Trump said, ""By the way, they hacked — they probably have her 33,000 emails. I hope they do. They probably have her 33,000 emails that she lost and deleted because you'd see some beauties there. So let's see."" And when NBC reporter Katy Tur asked whether he was encouraging a foreign country to hack into emails, he said, ""Now, if Russia or China or any other country has those emails, I mean, to be honest with you, I'd love to see them."" Trump tweeted a similar statement after the news conference (with still no trace of an LOL). If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI! Trump cast the comment as a joke later in the day, amid criticism of his request. Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade interviewed Trump the same day for a segment to run the next morning on ""Fox and Friends."" He asked Trump, ""Were you being sarcastic?"" Trump replied: ""Of course, I'm being sarcastic."" Trump’s response caught on with supporters Rudy Giuliani and Newt Gingrich who said the media missed the joke.  There’s no way to know what was going through Trump’s mind when he made the comment. Our job is to look for whether people laughed, and whether the media deceptively left that out (and neither happened).  The same day as Trump’s press conference, Russians launched their first email spear-phishing campaign of emails used by Clinton’s personal office. Trump said the media distorted his ""Russia, if you’re listening"" comment in 2016 by cutting out ""the laugher, the joke.""  The laughter was not cut. The full video shows that no laughter followed.  Trump has recast the delivery and response of his 2016 press conference in an effort to distort the media’s coverage.

Fact-checking Bernie Sanders’ comments about Florida Democrats who represent Cuban Americans
","Weeks before Florida’s March 17 primary, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders finds himself in hot water with some Democratic members of Congress over his comments about Cuba. On ""60 Minutes,"" Sanders said not everything Fidel Castro did was bad when he took power, singling out a literacy campaign. The criticism came fast, including from Florida’s Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott and some prominent Democrats. CNN anchor Chris Cuomo asked Sanders about the reaction in a town hall the next day: ""Now Democratic members of Congress who represent Cuban Americans in Florida — obviously you've got to win there — they're attacking your comment as ‘absolutely unacceptable,’ singing the praises of a murderous tyrant. Response?""  Sanders dismissed the criticism from fellow Democrats during their back and forth. ""By the way, all of those congresspeople that you mentioned just so happen to be supporting other candidates, just accidentally, no doubt, coincidentally,"" Sanders said. Sanders claim suggests — but doesn’t specify names — that the members of Congress prefer other candidates. They do seem to prefer anyone but Sanders, but they haven’t made specific endorsements, and they’re officially neutral.  It was easy to narrow down where the criticism was coming from. There are two Democratic congresswomen from South Florida who had tough words for Sanders, and both used just the words Cuomo described. They are South Florida Reps. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell and Donna Shalala. Mucarsel-Powell called Sanders’ comments ""absolutely unacceptable.""  As the first South American immigrant member of Congress who proudly represents thousands of Cuban Americans, I find Senator Bernie Sanders’ comments on Castro’s Cuba absolutely unacceptable. Shalala tweeted, ""I'm hoping that in the future, Senator Sanders will take time to speak to some of my constituents before he decides to sing the praises of a murderous tyrant like Fidel Castro."" div class='artembed'> I'm hoping that in the future, Senator Sanders will take time to speak to some of my constituents before he decides to sing the praises of a murderous tyrant like Fidel Castro. https://t.co/Iwvmay9LOH pic.twitter.com/KT9sQ0pfkh In 2018, both women won Miami-Dade districts that were previously held by Republicans and face competitive contests this year.

""That’s a hypothetical question, and since I don’t think he’s going to be the nominee, I don’t have to answer the question."" Mucarsel-Powell was more forceful in her response to the Herald: ""I’m seriously considering endorsing another candidate, that’s my answer to you."" A spokesman for Shalala said she will not endorse anyone until after the Florida primary. But she has not held back on donations. FEC records show that Shalala gave $1,000 to Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s presidential campaign in recent months, half in December and half in September. She also gave $500 to former Vice President Joe Biden in September. In September 2019, both Shalala and Mucarsel-Powell appeared at a Biden campaign event for Latino voters in Little Havana, a Miami neighborhood. Shalala also attended events in Miami-Dade County for Klobuchar and Bloomberg. (Shalala has long-standing relationships with many Democrats. She was President Bill Clinton’s former Health and Human Services secretary.) Mucarsel-Powell also has no plans to endorse and remains undecided, her spokesman told us. She has not made any donations to presidential candidates.  Sanders said Democratic members of Congress who represent Cuban Americans in Florida ""just so happen to be supporting other candidates."" Neither woman has endorsed a primary candidate. But they have not shown Sanders any primary love. On top of criticizing Sanders on Cuba, they have publicly cast doubt on whether they would support him as the Democratic nominee.

Does Mike Bloomberg own more wealth than the bottom 125 million Americans?
","Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., hammered home his message against billionaire Mike Bloomberg at a Democratic presidential debate. ""Mike Bloomberg owns more wealth than the bottom 125 million Americans,"" Sanders said during the Feb. 19 debate in Las Vegas. ""That’s wrong. That’s amoral."" We wanted to know if Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, was really richer than 38% of the country. After digging into the data, we found that Sanders was basically correct about how Bloomberg’s fortune compares with the rest of the country. The facts behind this claim, in many ways, underscore Sanders' broader message about income inequality. That said, some quirks in how wealth is distributed among households mean that millions of American — not just Bloomberg — own more wealth than millions of their compatriots. Let’s walk through the numbers.   Bloomberg’s net worth, as listed by Forbes magazine’s richest list, was $64.2 billion at the time of the Feb. 19 debate. That was enough to rank him as the 12th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes. The other half of the comparison is more complicated.  The Sanders campaign’s source is a column by Matt Bruenig of the People’s Policy Project, a think tank that has ""a special focus on socialist and social democratic economic ideas."" Bruenig was more specific than Sanders, writing that by his calculation of Federal Reserve ""summary extract public data,"" Bloomberg owns nearly six times as much wealth as the bottom 38% of households. (The ""bottom 38%"" here refers to the lowest 38% of households in wealth.)  When we contacted Bruenig, he said he used the Federal Reserve’s Summary Extract Public Data, which is offered for researchers to make calculations using statistical software. Bruenig provided us the code that he used with Python, a programming language. Bruenig said he sorted all households from those with the least wealth to those with the most wealth. He then added the wealth of the bottom 38% of American households to get $11.4 billion.  Then, he determined how many household units this accounted for and found the answer to be 47.8 million. You can then multiply the 47.8 million households by 2.63 (the average number of people per household) to come up with 125.7 million people. Matthew Gross, a doctoral candidate at the University of Michigan with data-analyzing experience, helped PolitiFact replicate Bruenig’s math. (He was recommended by Fabian T. Pfeffer, a University of Michigan sociologist who specializes in wealth inequality.) Gross found that the bottom 38% had about $6 billion in wealth, rather than Bruenig’s $11.4 billion, but either way, this was enough to verify the calculation that Bloomberg had more wealth than the bottom 38% of American households combined.  Specifically, Gross found that the aggregate wealth of the bottom 37% of households is -$44 billion. That means these households have more debt than they have assets. Meanwhile, he found that the 38th percentile alone owns about $50 billion. Together, then, percentiles 0 through 38 collectively own about $6 billion in wealth, which is less than Bloomberg had. In a technical sense, however, tens of millions of Americans join Bloomberg in owning more wealth than the bottom 37% of households combined, since the bottom 37% are collectively in the red. Sanders said, ""Mike Bloomberg owns more wealth than the bottom 125 million Americans."" The numbers check out. It’s worth noting, however, that since the bottom 37% of households — a number that adds up to roughly 123 million Americans — are collectively $44 billion in the red, millions of Americans are also richer than the collective bottom 37% of households.

No, poll does not say 38% of Americans won't drink Corona beer because of coronavirus
","If coronavirus hadn’t yet caught your attention, maybe disturbing news about the widening health threat and beer did. CNN, Esquire and other American mainstream news media reported incorrectly on a survey examining consumers’ feelings about the coronavirus and Corona beer. Some of those news stories, shared on Facebook, were topped by this errant headline: ""Poll Finds 38% of Americans Say They Will Not Drink Corona Beer Because of Virus."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The survey was done by a New York City firm, 5W Public Relations. The firm announced the results on Feb. 27, 2020, as public health concerns rose in the United States. The next day President Donald Trump held a news conference about the nation’s response to coronavirus. The survey ""via phone"" of 737 American beer drinkers over age 21 on Feb. 25 and 26 was done ""regarding their opinions about the popular Mexican beer brand, Corona, as a result of the deadly coronavirus that's spreading around the world,"" the PR firm’s news release said. So, this was a survey of beer drinkers, not of Americans overall. The first result reported in the release:  ""38% of beer-drinking Americans would not buy Corona under any circumstances now."" The release also does not say whether the survey was representative of American beer drinkers. The firm did not provide us the results of other questions, but told us these were the questions used in the survey: Are you a beer drinker? Are you a Corona drinker? Is Corona related to the coronavirus? In light of the coronavirus, do you plan to stop drinking Corona? Would you buy Corona in a store? Would you order a Corona in a restaurant/bar/public venue? Would you buy Corona under any circumstances now? The questions asked by the firm underscore the problems with the reliability of this poll. And because the PR firm won’t release more details, it’s ultimately untrustworthy. Respondents, for instance, were asked if Corona is related to the coronavirus but were never told it isn’t. They were then asked a leading question, ""In light of the coronavirus, do you plan to stop drinking Corona?"" that suggests some correlation between the beer and the virus even though there is none. And some respondents may have said they don’t drink Corona and would continue not to drink Corona. Nevertheless, the news release to the media was clear that the 38% figure applied to beer drinkers, not Americans overall. At PolitiFact, we’re used to seeing a fair number of either misleading polls, or misleading reports about polls. In this case, the lack of transparency by the polling firm (a PR company) means you should be skeptical, too. Some news organizations, however, were not. You can read PolitiFact’s guide to polling to better understand what to look for and what types of polls to stay away from. A statement shared on Facebook said: ""Poll Finds 38% of Americans Say They Will Not Drink Corona Beer Because of Virus."" The poll was of American beer drinkers, not Americans overall. Other details of this ""poll"" — including the specific question asked — are unknown, so it’s difficult to say beer drinkers wouldn’t drink Corona beer because of the virus, or some other reason.

In an exchange about coronavirus, Homeland Security chief gets flu mortality rate wrong
","During a Senate appropriations Feb. 25 subcommittee hearing, Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, said the U.S. flu mortality rate was about the same as the current estimated global mortality rate of the coronavirus outbreak.  He made this statement during an exchange with Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) regarding what the acting secretary knew about the coronavirus, which causes a disease known as COVID-19. This C-SPAN video shows the full discussion between the two.  Kennedy first asked what the worldwide mortality rate for coronavirus is, to which Wolf responded, that it was ""under 2%"" but that he would need to check with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to get the actual figure and that ""it changes daily."" The Louisiana senator then asked, ""What’s the mortality rate for influenza over, say, the last 10 years in America?"" Wolf answered: ""It’s also right around that percentage as well. I don’t have that offhand, but it’s right around 2% as well.""  We asked the Department of Homeland Security where Wolf’s figure came from.  A DHS spokesperson said in an email, ""As the acting secretary said in his hearing, he did not have that information on hand and refers to Health and Human Services -- the federal agency in charge of the federal government’s coronavirus response.""  The comparison of coronavirus to flu in terms of mortality rates seemed like an important mechanism to understanding the growing concern about the reach of coronavirus, so we decided to dig deeper to find out if these statistics hold up. We also asked experts to explain what the numbers mean in terms of risk.  Digging into mortality rate numbers  The CDC directed us to its online influenza resources and referred us to the World Health Organization for more information on coronavirus. Christopher Mores, a global health professor at George Washington University, helped make sense of some of the figures. He calculated the average, 10-year mortality rate for flu using CDC data and found it was 0.1%. That 0.1% rate is frequently cited among experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, called it ""sort of the canonical seasonal influenza mortality figure.""  It’s important to note, that although this percentage seems like a small number, influenza is responsible for an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 deaths annually.   Now, for coronavirus.  According to statistics released Feb. 17 by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the mortality rate for coronavirus was 2.3%. That’s based on cases reported through Feb. 11 and calculated by dividing the numbers of coronavirus-related deaths at the time (1,023) by the number of the confirmed cases (44,672) of the coronavirus. (These numbers reflect the information available at the time of the secretary’s testimony.) But this report has limitations, Mores said, including the vague way Chinese officials are defining who has been infected by the coronavirus.  ""We have not been able to understand what precisely has gone on there,"" said Mores. ""They have changed their case definitions multiple times. It’s murky what has gone into the case count and who has gone into being counted on cases.""  The WHO said in a press conference Monday that in Wuhan, China, the city where the virus first hit, the mortality rate ranged from 2% to 4%. Officials said that in the rest of China, outside of Wuhan, the mortality rate of coronavirus is 0.7%.  Mike Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the mortality rate in China has since risen to 0.9%.  Right now he doesn’t see a similarity in the flu mortality rate and the coronavirus mortality rate. ""We don’t have any evidence to that being the case,"" said Osterholm.  Mores said U.S. health officials just don’t have enough information to know whether the two mortality rates are similar. Understanding this comparison would offer a means to better understand the severity of the coronavirus. It could also help in educating the public about the novel illness. ""Until we can gain our own experience with this virus, it’s going to be pretty squishy. So, all the numbers that you have come across here are within the range of possibility,"" he said. ""Absolutely, the hope is we will end up with something similar to the flu, but we just don’t know yet.""  Multiple experts told us that the number of coronavirus cases not just in China but worldwide has probably been undercounted because many people with the infection do not suffer serious symptoms and may not seek medical treatment. It is possible that only those who have tested positive are being counted as ""confirmed cases.""  Until the case definition is expanded, they said, to include people clinicians think may have COVID-19 but who were not tested for it, then the total estimated number of cases will remain lower than the likely reality. But, if the number of cases widens to include those with mild symptoms who have not been tested, then the mortality rate will go down.  This is the way mortality rates are calculated for the flu, said Mores. The numbers of flu illnesses and deaths are estimates based not only on positive flu tests, but also on doctors’ suspicions and symptomatic diagnosis.  One key difference between the flu and the coronavirus illness, Osterholm cautioned, is that, with the flu, the population has a partially built up immunity, whether through receiving flu shots or already having been exposed to the illness.  Mores concurred. ""You know, the risk is this: We have a brand-new virus in a completely naive population on Earth, we’re all susceptible to it. Everyone is potentially infectable with this virus,"" he said. ""Even with a high transmission rate and the low case fatality rate, that still becomes a massive number of ill and fatal cases.""  Our ruling  There are two ways to parse out this claim: First, is it true that the average U.S. mortality rate for flu is 2%?  That’s not true, according to data from the CDC and exchanges with multiple global health experts. On average, the flu mortality rate during the past 10 years has been 0.1%. In addition, Wolf and a DHS spokesperson admitted that the acting secretary did not have the statistics in front of him when he answered questions at the hearing about the mortality rates.  Second, is it true the COVID-19 mortality rate is similar to the flu mortality rate?  Wolf is also wrong on that account, based on the limited information currently known about the coronavirus. Recent data from the Chinese government set the COVID-19 mortality rate at 2.3%. That’s vastly different from the flu’s mortality rate of 0.1%.  Experts also said that while it’s possible the mortality rate from the new virus could come close to the flu’s mortality rate eventually ― if the case definition of coronavirus is expanded -- it’s too soon to make that assumption with the limited information available.  For these reasons, we rate the claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097639FC0>],/factchecks/2020/mar/02/chad-wolf/n-exchange-about-coronavirus-homeland-security-chi/

Cunningham says Tills voted to 'take away' coverage for pre-existing conditions
","From Republican U.S. Senate candidates, voters are likely to hear about the economy under President Trump. From Democratic Senate candidates, voters are likely to hear about the need for better health care policy. Nowhere is that more true than North Carolina, where a handful of Democrats are vying to knock out incumbent Republican Thom Tillis. One of them is Cal Cunningham, who has support from the Democratic Party establishment. The Cunningham campaign recently released an ad accusing Tillis of voting to ""take away"" coverage for pre-existing conditions. The Feb. 5 tweet says, ""Without coverage for pre-existing conditions, Susie and her family would be bankrupt. Those protections are exactly what Thom Tillis voted to take away."" Included in the tweet is a video that profiles a mother named Susie who says her daughter has a pre-existing condition. ""Without pre-existing condition coverage, we would be bankrupt,"" Susie says.  Cunningham then appears on screen to say, ""Those protections for Susie’s children are exactly what Thom Tillis voted to take away."" Then this text appears over a photo of Tillis: ""Tillis voted against protections for pre-existing conditions."" Is it true that Tillis voted to take away coverage for people with pre-existing conditions? Yes. Tillis voted to repeal a law, the Affordable Care Act, that provides that coverage. While repeal efforts have been unsuccessful, repealing and replacing the ACA has been part of the Tillis platform for years. He voted to repeal the ACA, and later proposed a different law that aims to address pre-existing conditions. But experts say the Tillis plan, along with other Republican proposals, fall short of offering the coverage in the ACA. First, some background. A pre-existing condition is a health problem that someone has before their health coverage starts. Examples include asthma, cancer, diabetes or lupus. Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, insurers could deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions or inflate their premiums so much that they dropped coverage, as PolitiFact and its partners have previously reported. The Cunningham ad specifically mentions a vote from July 26, 2015: the roll call for a vote to allow the repeal of the health care law. You can see from the bill’s ""statement of purpose"" that it was meant to ""repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 entirely.""  The record shows Tillis voted to repeal it. ""Certainly, this provision, if enacted, would have removed coverage of pre-existing conditions because it would have repealed the ACA in its entirety, which would have restored law to what it was prior to 2010, when pre-existing conditions often were not covered in most states, or by federal law,"" said Mark Hall, a law and health professor at Wake Forest University. PolitiFact has repeatedly determined that a vote to repeal the ACA in full would have stripped coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Subsequent GOP-written bills to replace the ACA have not ensured the same level of patients with those conditions. When PolitiFact reached out to the Tillis campaign, spokesman Andrew Romeo didn’t dispute Tillis’ vote from 2015.  But he claimed Tillis has always supported replacing Obamacare ""with a health care law that retains that critical provision, in addition to ensuring Americans under the age of 26 can stay on their family's health plan,"" Romeo said. He added that Tillis has ""taken steps to ensure that patients with pre-existing conditions maintain those protections regardless of Obamacare's future."" Romeo was referencing a bill Tillis co-sponsored known as ""The Protect Act,"" which claims to protect people with pre-existing conditions. But experts say that bill falls short. Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow studying health reform and private insurance for the Kaiser Family Foundation, said the bill doesn’t prevent insurance companies from price gouging. The bill includes language prohibiting discrimination based on health status. But, Pollitz said, it doesn’t prohibit insurers from charging women more than men. She paraphrased lines on pages 9 and 10 of the bill, saying ""nothing in the nondiscrimination requirement ‘shall be construed to restrict the amount that an employer or individual may be charged for coverage under a group health plan except as provided in paragraph 3 or individual health coverage’."" Pollitz said Tillis may have attempted to include price-gouging protections, ""but the language they used is riddled with loopholes that would continue to permit discriminatory rating practices."" To prevent price gouging, health bills should offer subsidies. Tillis’ bill guaranteed the issuance of insurance but didn’t provide funding to make premiums affordable, said David Anderson, research associate at Duke University’s Center for Health Policy. Under Tillis’ bill, Anderson said there was little incentive to keep healthy people in the market pool. So insurers would have two options. ""They can either leave the market entirely or dramatically increase premiums to cover a very sick and expensive group of people,"" he said. ""Since there are no premium subsidies in this bill, insurance will be too expensive for individuals who are in good health to purchase."" PolitiFact reported in 2019 that most of the Republican health care plans fail to fully protect people with pre-existing conditions. A fact-check of White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney singled out the plan proposed by Tillis and other Republican senators. It found that the bill included an option for companies to deny certain coverage if they weren’t able to ""adequately"" deliver services. That fact-check quote critics of Obamacare, such as health care consultant Bob Laszewski and former Republican Senate health care policy staffer Rodney Whitlock, saying the Republican proposals fall short of the coverage offered by the ACA. Cunningham’s ad says Tillis voted to take away coverage for pre-existing conditions. It’s true that Tillis voted for a straight repeal of the Affordable Care Act, a move that likely would have left Americans with pre-existing conditions vulnerable. Tillis’ campaign is right to point out that he has tried to address the issue. But experts agree that the Tillis proposal left loopholes insurance companies could use against people with pre-existing conditions. Cunningham’s statement overlooks some of Tillis’ efforts. But it’s correct about Tillis’ vote and the fact that other Republican plans fall short of matching the ACA’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions. We rate it Mostly True. An earlier version of this fact check quoted an expert who said the ""Protect Act"" introduced by Sen. Tillis would have allowed insurance companies to avoid covering people’s pre-existing conditions. In fact, the bill was written to prevent insurance companies from doing that. The expert has revised her comments.  This correction has no bearing on the overall rating. Tillis voted to fully repeal the ACA, and bills proposed by Tillis and other Republicans still fall short of matching the ACA’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D8D080>],/factchecks/2020/mar/02/cal-cunningham/cunningham-says-tills-voted-take-away-coverage-pre/

Bernie Sanders’ voting record on wars is mixed
","A shareable image circulating on social media claims that Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders ""voted in favor of every war during his tenure"" in Congress. ""Just like the rest."" Sanders portrays himself as an opponent of open-ended military intervention overseas; his campaign website’s issues page says he will ""follow the American people, who do not want endless war.""  But the post is incorrect about his record. (The Sanders campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Sanders has had a long career in Congress, first serving in the House between 1991 and 2007, and since then in the Senate, representing Vermont. His party affiliation in Congress is as an independent, but he caucuses with Democrats and is running for the Democratic presidential nomination. When we looked at some of the major war-related votes Sanders has taken, we find that he did vote in support of some of them, but he also voted against others. Here’s a rundown: Persian Gulf War, 1991: Sanders voted against authorizing the war.  Iraq War, 2002: Sanders voted against authorizing the war. War in Yemen, 2018: Not only did Sanders vote to end U.S. military support for Saudia Arabia’s war in Yemen, but Sanders was the lead sponsor of the bill. He managed the unusual feat of securing bipartisan support for the measure during the presidency of Donald Trump. Trump eventually vetoed the resolution and the Senate was unable to override his veto. Bosnia War, 1998. This measure was for removing military forces after they were already there. It failed, but Sanders voted against it. So he voted in favor of staying. He joined most Democrats in voting against it, effectively supporting President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. Kosovo War, 1999. Sanders voted yes on this measure to authorize the war, which failed in the House. Here, too, Sanders joined most Democrats in voting to back the use of force by Clinton. Post-9/11 authorization for the use of military force, 2001: Sanders voted in favor. Only one House member, Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., voted against the measure. The post says that Sanders ""voted in favor of every war during his tenure."" That’s incorrect. Sanders’ record on major war authorization votes is actually mixed. While he cast votes affirming military actions in Bosnia, Kosovo, and after 9/11, Sanders voted against entering the Persian Gulf War in 1991, against entering the Iraq War in 2002, and successfully led the charge to pass a measure that would have removed U.S. support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen in 2018.

"['City Government', 'Homeless', 'New York', 'Michael Bloomberg']","
Bloomberg makes accurate claim on reducing street homelessness, though full picture much different
","During his campaign for president, Michael Bloomberg has pointed to his record as a three-term mayor of New York City, highlighting certain parts to appeal to Democratic primary voters.  On his campaign website, Bloomberg claims that during his tenure, ""street homelessness decreased by 28 percent.""  ""As Mayor of New York City, Mike led one of the nation’s most ambitious affordable housing plans, implementing several initiatives that have been replicated in cities around the country. During his tenure, street homelessness decreased by 28% and more than 170,000 affordable homes were built or preserved,"" his site states.  We were curious about Bloomberg’s claim about ""street homelessness,"" and reached out to the campaign. Spokesman Michael Frazier directed us to a city report from 2013.   According to the Mayor’s Management Report, ""the estimate of those living on the street in 2013 is 28 percent lower than the baseline established in 2005.""  Street homelessness is a portion of the total number of people who are homeless. The city considers people who sleep on the streets or in the parks or subway system to be part of this subset. It does not include the much larger number of people in the city’s shelters. The Bloomberg administration began counting people who are part of the street homeless population in 2005. Data from the city’s Department of Homeless Services show a 28 percent drop in the number of people who slept on the streets or in the parks and subway during annual point-in-time counts between 2005 and 2013. On March 7, 2005, volunteers counted 4,395 street homeless people for the inaugural Homeless Outreach Population Estimate, or HOPE count. On Jan. 28, 2013, the last year of Bloomberg's tenure, the count was 3,180.  The count on Jan. 27, 2014, a month after Bloomberg left office, was 3,357, or a drop of 24 percent from 2005.    The Urban Institute published a report in 2014, funded by the Bloomberg administration, supporting Bloomberg’s claim.  Under Bloomberg, New York City became a ""national model for how to reduce unsheltered and chronic homelessness,"" wrote Josh Leopold, a senior research associate. In an interview, Leopold said the administration did not interfere with his work on the report. Bloomberg’s management background contributed to the city’s efforts to organize street outreach and coordinate services for homeless people, he said.  ""His administration should get a lot of credit for that,"" Leopold said.   While the counting methodology does account for including some people the counters may have missed, the data can be unreliable, according to some experts.  In a paper published by the conservative American Enterprise Institute, Kevin C. Corinth wrote that ""street counts are inherently difficult to conduct and should therefore be treated cautiously.""  Giselle Routhier, policy director for Coalition for the Homeless, an advocacy organization that has been critical of Bloomberg, said that the shelter census is a better measure.  ""We never trust the HOPE estimate,"" Routhier said. The count could be influenced by various factors, such as the weather. Counters can also miss homeless people on the street because they may not always be in publicly visible places, such as an ATM vestibule, and efforts to get people off the street in the week before the annual count can affect the result, she said.  New York City provides temporary emergency shelter to every eligible man, woman, and child, every night. This means that many of the city's homeless are in shelters, not on the street, Routhier said.  While the street homeless population has fluctuated between 2,328 and 4,395 since 2005, according to the HOPE counts, the shelter population surpassed 50,000 under Bloomberg.  Other homelessness experts gave Bloomberg mixed report cards on his efforts, even as some said that his claim of reducing street homelessness is correct.  Thomas J. Main, a professor at the Marxe School of Public and International Affairs at Baruch College, credited Bloomberg’s efforts to prevent homelessness and his outreach to people living on the street. On balance, Bloomberg's record is positive, Main said. Main, however, wrote in his book, ""Homelessness in New York City: Policymaking from Koch to de Blasio,"" that a policy change that ended homeless families receiving priority in access to public housing ""would be seen as part of the reason why the shelter population was to grow to unprecedented levels."" Main also notes homelessness is sometimes driven by factors outside of a mayor’s control, such as recessions and state and federal policy.  City University of New York Professor John Krinsky called Bloomberg’s claim ""both technically true and very misleading,"" given the increase in the number of people staying in homeless shelters.   Bloomberg claimed that under his administration, street homelessness decreased by 28 percent.  City data confirms it decreased by 28 percent from when the city began counting in 2005, three years into Bloomberg's first term, until the year he left office.  As experts pointed out, many more homeless people in New York City stay in shelters and do not live on the streets. But the Bloomberg claim specifically cited street homelessness.   We rate this claim True.   ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C88400>],/factchecks/2020/mar/01/michael-bloomberg/bloombergs-claim-reducing-street-homelessness-corr/
"['Taxes', 'Illinois', 'Quentin Fulks']","
Are Californians staying put despite high top income tax rate?
","Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker is pinning many of his budget goals for the coming fiscal year on voters approving a ballot measure permitting the state to raise tax rates on high earners. Without approval of the constitutional amendment in November, which would permit Illinois to institute higher rates on those making more than $250,000 a year, the governor’s proposed budget holds back a $1.4 billion revenue boost to education and other state services. In an interview on WTTW the week after Pritzker’s budget address, the chairman of the campaign to pass the ballot measure was asked to defend the tax plan, which opponents say will drive residents and businesses from the state. ""I don’t think that there’s any correlation between individuals leaving a state and tax rates,"" said Quentin Fulks, who chairs the Vote Yes for Fairness campaign and previously worked for Pritzker’s 2018 campaign for governor. Fulks cited the high number of millionaires in California, the nation’s most populous state, and then made a claim that caught our attention. California, he said, ""has a top tax rate of 13.3%, which is a pretty high tax rate, and people aren’t leaving."" The proposal in Illinois would take the top tax rate to nearly 8%. In raw numbers, California saw more people overall depart for other states during the last year than any other, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. So we decided to find out what Fulks meant when he said ""people aren’t leaving"" California and whether its highest-in-the-nation top marginal rate specifically has affected its population. We’ve fact-checked statements from Illinois politicians on both sides of the debate about how graduated-tax states are faring, including a False claim that New York sent its wealthy fleeing the state after instituting a tax structure requiring them to pay more. Fulks was also talking about top earners, a spokesperson told us. ""If you look at Quentin’s answer on WTTW, it’s clear he is referencing those who pay the 13.3% tax rate in California – those making over a million dollars – as those who are not leaving the state,"" Vote Yes for Fairness spokesperson Lara Sisselman wrote in an email. Fulks’ phrasing on WTTW was less than clear. He was asked about people and businesses leaving the state generally, and did not explicitly state that the wealthy weren’t leaving California. That said, the overall context of his remarks in that portion of the interview do suggest he was referring to those who actually pay the top rate he cited. Even if Fulks had only been speaking about California’s population more generally, he’d have a point when it comes to whether the state’s 2012 tax hike has driven Californians away. More people have left California for elsewhere in the country than moved there from other states in each year since that tax increase. But like Illinois, that’s been the case for decades. California’s overall population has continued to grow due to immigration from abroad and having more births than deaths. California ""has suffered domestic migration losses (movement into and out of other parts of the U.S.) since at least 2000 and for some years prior to that,"" Brookings Institution demographer William Frey wrote in an email, citing an analysis of census estimates he shared with us. To Fulks’ point, only the state’s wealthiest pay its top rate — though like Pritzker’s plan, rates also went up to a lesser degree on those making more than $250,000. California did not raise rates on income below that amount. From 2005 to 2012, income over $1 million had been taxed at 10.3% there. So we turned to research assessing the effect the 2012 increase had on migration among those subject to the rate Fulks highlighted. Some of the findings support his case, others do not. His spokesperson cited a finding from a 2018 report by researchers at the Stanford Center on Poverty & Inequality that shows net migration of millionaires overall since 2007 has remained positive. However, the study also found — based on an analysis that compared migration changes with a control group of high earners not subject to the top rate — that the 2012 increase did indeed lead to a small loss of 0.04% of California’s millionaire population. ""Our overall conclusion is, yes, millionaires do sometimes move to lower-tax states — as we see for California in 2012,"" researcher Cristobal Young told us in an email. ""In 2012, there was a large tax increase that produced millionaire out-migration — but by an amount that was too small to matter for overall state revenues or tax policy,"" he said. Using the same set of tax data, researchers at Stanford’s conservative Hoover Institution found a larger increase in the rate of departures among top earners after 2012. Their report defined a departing taxpayer more broadly than Young and his colleague did and did not address net migration. Meanwhile, reports by California’s nonpartisan legislative research arm and the Sacramento Bee have found that since the early 2000s, the state has gained rather than lost residents making over $100,000. Saying he did not see a connection between individuals leaving a state and higher tax rates, Fulks pointed to California’s 13.3% top rate and said, ""people aren’t leaving."" His office clarified he was only referring to people subject to that top rate. Based on the context of his remarks, that makes sense. The research on millionaire migration in California after the state’s top tax rate in 2012 is mixed. For instance, a Stanford report highlighted by Fulks’ office found a small number of millionaires did leave after the tax was hiked. However, it also notes the net migration of millionaires to the state remains positive. We rate Fulks’ claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

The story includes a 27-second C-SPAN video that allegedly shows the celebration. We fact-checked this claim two years ago when a North Dakota political blog similarly claimed that the two senators high-fived after the controversial abortion vote. The vote in question was to proceed to a motion that would make illegal nearly all abortions after 20 weeks and subject anyone who performed the procedure to prison time or fines. Senators voted 51-46 yea-to-nay; Heitkamp was one of the nay votes. The video shows Heitkamp walking into the chamber, responding to the clerk’s roll call in the negative, and chatting with Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. Schumer approaches them; he and Heitkamp wave hello and clasp each other’s hand. Booker pats Schumer’s shoulder. The senators’ conversation is inaudible. Aides for Heitkamp and Schumer told PolitiFact in 2018 that the senators were greeting each other and that they did not speak about the vote in their interaction. When Heitkamp and Schumer met, the vote was about halfway through, so the hand clasp was not in reaction to a final tally and their exchange did not look like a high-five.

Howard Marklein says beer drinking is not allowed in Illinois state parks
","Amid the debate over Gov. Scott Walker’s 2015-’17 budget proposal, a number of ideas have popped up about how to generate revenue for Wisconsin state parks. Among them: Beer. Well, sort of. During a March 3, 2015, meeting of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, state Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, suggested to Natural Resources Secretary Cathy Stepp that there was a way to capitalize on all the visitors from Illinois. Wisconsin already charges higher state parks admission fees for visitors from other states. Annual stickers cost $25 for Badgers and $35 for others; a night camping at Devil’s Lake, our most-visited park, is $15 for Wisconsin residents and $17 for outsiders. Marklein said fees could be raised, and the flatlanders -- er, Illinois residents -- would keep on coming to Wisconsin. Why? ""They love coming up,"" Marklein said. ""They can drink beer in our parks. They can't there."" Wisconsinites have a long-standing love-hate relationship with visitors from Illinois. For many in the hospitality business, Illinois visitors are a vital source of revenue. Others fret that they overwhelm Wisconsin with big city driving habits and attitudes. But aside from the all that, we wondered if Marklein is right. You can pop a brewski at Devil’s Lake State Park, or other parks in Wisconsin, but you can’t do that in the Land of Lincoln? When we followed up with Marklein, aide Crystal Potts said the senator was basing his comments on a list posted in the Illinois Department of Natural Resources website. The list, under the tab ""alcohol restrictions,"" lists 53 state parks and recreation areas -- from Apple River Canyon State Park to Wolf Creek State Park. The page says violators face a misdemeanor that carries a fine of $75 to up to $1,500 and one to six months in jail. That’s pretty steep for a Bud Light by the campfire. In Wisconsin, other than a handful of exceptions, drinking is allowed in state parks. But there are a couple problems with Marklein’s list. First, for many of the parks the list notes restrictions only at certain areas within a park, not the entire park. What’s more, there are many state parks in Illinois that are not on the list at all. The Illinois DNR confirmed that there is not a universal alcohol ban in that state. ""Out of the 130 parks, there are 77 (where) alcohol is allowed,"" said an email from the Illinois DNR. ""It is only banned in the parks that are listed."" So we’ve got plenty of reasons for visitors to escape to Wisconsin and -- with budget troubles -- perhaps even a new reason to charge them more. But the pleasure of a cold beer on a hot summer night isn’t among them. Our rating Marklein wants to boost state parks’ charges for out of state residents, and -- noting how many people from Illinois come to Wisconsin -- he claimed visitors can’t drink in state parks in Illinois. But you can drink in  more than half of the parks in that state. We rate Marklein’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809772F780>],/factchecks/2015/mar/20/howard-marklein/howard-marklein-says-beer-drinking-not-allowed-ill/

Is there a gap for rideshare insurance coverage in Georgia?
","Ride-sharing services have become ubiquitous in Georgia, especially in metro Atlanta’s urban core where millennial and party-goers often tap the app-based services to get around. State lawmakers last year failed to pass legislation to regulate Uber, Lyft and other similar services. A study committee last fall recommended specific regulations that have become two bills that have already cleared the House this session. House Bill 190 takes up the insurance gap raised in the committee report. It would require the firms to maintain $1 million in insurance coverage for service drivers and also mandates $300,000 coverage for bodily injury or death and $50,000 for property damage for drivers. Both apply to drivers when they are logged into the company’s system. State Rep. Rich Golick, R-Smyrna, said the proposal is about passenger safety, not regulation. ""Under Georgia law, there is no requirement for these companies to carry insurance related to their business activities,"" Golick, the chairman of the House Non-Civil Judicial Committee who works in the private sector as a regional attorney for Allstate Insurance company, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Golick also mentioned that the firms do carry similar insurance, but it is voluntary and with different coverage limits. So PolitiFact Georgia wondered, is Golick right, or does the Peach State already tell ride-share companies to insure their drivers? The answer is not a surprise given the relative youth of the ride-share industry. The independent contractors who drive their own cars for the services are of course required to have personal insurance for their vehicles. But insurance officials told the study committee that those individual policies don’t apply once the contractors begin making money driving for the services. State law even lets insurance companies cancel policies on drivers found to be conducting commercial activity, like the ride shares, on personal insurance. Put simply, your personal auto insurance won’t cover an incident when you’re driving for Uber or Lyft, whether when picking folks up or tooling around looking for fares. Uber and Lyft testified that they remedy that problem by offering $1 million in coverage every time one of their drivers has passengers. Ube also lists its insurance coverage on a company blog. The coverage amounts are higher in the Georgia proposal for times when there are no passengers, but the company has a $1 million policy in place for its drivers any time they are  heading to pick up a fare or passengers are in an Uber-contracted vehicle. Golick’s pending bill is more strict, though. It would mandate that coverage begin the moment a driver turns on the app – the ride-share equivalent of taxi drivers turning on their lights to signal they’re available for fares. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has called for such action. And the Georgia Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens has endorsed Golick’s bill. ""The state has a safety obligation to make sure there is coverage when the personal policy of these drivers doesn’t apply,"" Golick said. ""And it heads off the problem of a gap in coverage before a tragic situation occurs."" There have been tragedies elsewhere. In 2013, a 6-year-old girl was killed after she, her younger brother and mother were hit by a car in a San Francisco crosswalk. The driver was logged into Uber’s app at the time and was between fares at the time. Uber has acknowledged the driver was logged into its system. But it is fighting a lawsuit that seeks for its insurance to pay for medical and burial expenses because the driver was not carrying a passenger, about to pick one up or responding to a fare request at the time of the accident. Company spokesman Taylor Bennett said Uber’s coverage applies the moment a driver accepts a request. Uber also provides contingent coverage between trips, so that, ""for whatever reason their personal coverage doesn’t kick in, we will cover that."" The ride-share industry opposes HB 190 and is instead more supportive of House Bill 225, which requires ride-share drivers to pass background checks and makes the companies themselves pay taxes or annual fees, which they do not pay now. At least 21 other states are weighing some kind of regulation for the ride-share firms this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Five have enacted new laws, including one in California that puts the same mandates on the companies as HB 190 would in Georgia. At the same time, insurance companies are developing policy options that would allow individuals to add on ride-share coverage to their private insurance. Those policies are not yet available in Georgia. ""The industry is moving in the direction that is evolving with the innovations taking place in the insurance arena, yet (Golick) he is proposing a law that ignores these innovations,"" Bennett said. ""That makes it more difficult to operate in the state of Georgia and therefore more difficult for folks there to start their own businesses and partner with us."" In other words, the bill remains a source of debate. But even the Uber and Lyft acknowledge their popular services are too new for there to be existing regulations on how they operate. Lawmakers and ride-share firms may differ on what regulations will work or are needed. But Golick said simply that Georgia doesn’t have any regulations on the firms at this point. On that point, he’s dead on. We rate his claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FA58C0>],/factchecks/2015/mar/20/rich-golick/there-gap-rideshare-insurance-coverage-georgia/

Much more than 10 percent of Jeb Bush's emails are public record
","Hillary Clinton might be in a bit of hot water for using a private email account for official business as secretary of state, but Democrats eagerly point to similar email issues with presumptive Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush. As governor of Florida, Bush burnished his tech and public access credentials by using a personal email account to supplement the one the state provided. Prior to Clinton’s troubles, Bush set up a special website for the public to browse any of those emails that dealt with official business. Like Clinton, Bush himself determined which ones were private and which would be made public, but the move was largely seen as a way to mark Bush as a candidate who walks the walk when it comes to transparency. This led Democratic activist James Carville to challenge how transparent Bush really is. ""Jeb Bush has released 10 percent of his emails,"" Carville said on ABC’s This Week, March 15, 2015. ""He had a private email server. He destroyed his emails."" We decided to check Carville’s numbers. Carville’s assistant, Kees Nordin, gave PunditFact the underlying math. ""The fact is that of Jeb Bush's 3 million emails (public and private) he's only released 275,000 or just under 10 percent,"" Nordin said. According to Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell, Bush posted nearly 280,000 emails from his personal email account on a website he set up, jebbushemails.com. Back in 2007, Bush gave an off-the-cuff estimate that during his eight years in office he received about 550,000 emails at his personal address [email protected] We tried to confirm that number, but Campbell said ""It’s immaterial as they are not subject to public records request and not required by law to be retained."" In the same interview in 2007, Bush said an additional 2.5 million emails came through other email accounts run by the state. So this is how Carville gets to a grand total of 3 million emails. The question is, did Bush reveal just 275,000 -- or 280,000 -- of them? The answer is no, because most of them have been, and remain, publicly available. Under Florida law, most of Bush's emails to his government accounts are a public record and accessible to people who request them, said Barbara Petersen, president of Florida’s First Amendment Foundation. (The First Amendment Foundation advocates for government transparency and receives major support from foundations and Florida’s news organizations, including the Tampa Bay Times.) ""Anything relating to public business is a public record in Florida,"" Petersen said. ""If you comment on a policy, even if the rest of the email is personal, it will be subject to a public records request. It’s a fairly broad definition.""  Importantly, all of the emails sent to accounts run by the state would have been seen and vetted by state workers, not private staffers or lawyers employed by Bush. They remain the custodian of those records, and Petersen said she believes most of the Bush emails from his official accounts have been retained. The first stop for those emails would be the Citizen Services office, which fields all incoming communications to the governor. While some emails might be purely personal or otherwise exempt and would not be released, they were still part of the state’s public record. The point being, only the 550,000 emails sent to Bush’s personal account would have remained under his exclusive control. The rest remain housed with the state government. What's the point? We can confidently say that the 280,000 emails on the Bush website represent just a fraction of the total number of emails that are ""public."" While the precise figures are unclear, if 2.5 million emails went to one of the state-run email accounts then all of those were subject to a public records request. So in a rough sense, close to 90 percent of the universe of 3 million emails are public in some form. If you look at just Bush's private emails, about 50 percent are public. Neither number is close to the one Carville cited. We reached out to state officials to see if they can add any information about the number of official emails that are part of Bush's record. We will update this item if we learn further details. A few notes  Carville said Bush had a private email server. According to press reports, Bush used a server located in the governor's office. He took the server with him when he left office.  Carville also said Bush destroyed the emails he hadn’t revealed. We asked how he knew that and got no reply. Petersen had the same question and noted that Florida law presents a hurdle to destroying emails. ""If you made a public record request of Jeb’s email and you thought you didn't get them all, you can file suit in civil court and request an in camera inspection by a judge,"" she said. Petersen said the state judges which records have archival value and which ones are trivial and can be disposed.  Our ruling Carville said that Bush revealed 10 percent of his emails and he destroyed his emails. The numbers don’t add up. The numbers used by Carville himself include 2.5 million emails sent to state run accounts. Those emails are subject to a public records request. It is completely inaccurate to say that Bush only revealed 275,000 or 280,000 emails out of a total of 3 million. A more accurate reading would be that he revealed about half of the emails sent to his private account, and the rest were already available to the press, although some might be held back if they were strictly personal in nature.

"['Abortion', 'New Hampshire', ""William O'Brien""]","
NH Rep. Bill O'Brien says Margaret Sanger was active participant in KKK 
","Debates about Planned Parenthood often find their way back to Margaret Sanger, the outspoken birth control advocate who founded a forerunner to the group. Opponents of Planned Parenthood, and of abortion more generally, have seized on Sanger’s sometimes controversial beliefs as a way to discredit the organization that she helped found. Such was the case on Feb. 8, 2015, when former New Hampshire speaker of the House William O’Brien posted a lengthy online comment about a previous fact check. O’Brien writes, in his first paragraph: ""In language that would only occur to one of the liberal elite, here is what Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood and an active participant in the Klu Klux Klan and the eugenics movement, had to say about the immigrants, blacks and poor people for whom that organization’s services were targeted,"" going on to quote Sanger as saying they were ""human beings who never should have been born."" That’s a lot to unpack. There is little question that Sanger supported the eugenics movement (more on that later), but one statement really stuck out. Sanger was ""an active participant in the Ku Klux Klan."" PolitiFact NH decided to check it out. It turns out, Sanger did speak to a group connected to the KKK and wrote about it openly. In Margaret Sanger: An Autobiography, published in 1938, Sanger details her work advocating birth control across the United States and emphasizes her willingness to talk to virtually anyone. ""Always to me any aroused group was a good group,"" Sanger writes, ""and therefore I accepted an invitation to talk to the women's branch of the Ku Klux Klan at Silver Lake, New Jersey, one of the weirdest experiences I had in lecturing."" Sanger’s account suggests she didn't hold the group in the highest esteem. After arriving at the meeting, a complicated process that involved driving to a secret location, it was time for her to speak. ""Never before had I looked into a sea of faces like these. I was sure that if I uttered one word, such as abortion, outside the usual vocabulary of these women they would go off into hysteria. And so my address that night had to be in the most elementary terms, as though I were trying to make children understand,"" Sanger writes. It’s important to note that the Women of the Ku Klux Klan was not the KKK itself. It was a parallel, official organization, with branches in all 48 states. It supported the goals of the men’s group, and was based in Little Rock, Ark. And that’s a far cry from being an ""active participant"" in the Ku Klux Klan, as O’Brien claims. As for Sanger, she indeed supported the eugenics movement. While the notion that the human race could be perfected by better breeding led to a horrific outcome in the Holocaust, it had been widely accepted in progressive, reformist political circles. Supporters included Winston Churchill, H. G. Wells, Theodore Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover, George Bernard Shaw and economist John Maynard Keynes. And while he disagreed with and worked to debunk eugenicists who insisted on black people’s inferiority, African-American activist W. E. B. Du Bois subscribed to a number of the movement’s principles. In other words, supporting eugenics did not automatically equal racism. Jean H. Baker, who wrote the biography Margaret Sanger: A Life of Passion and is the Bennett-Harwood professor of history at Goucher College in Maryland, says attempts to paint Sanger as a bigot are simply false. ""As for Sanger as a supporter of KKK, it is just untrue,"" Baker wrote in an email. ""She was far ahead of her times in terms of opposing racial segregation. She worked closely with black leaders to open birth control clinics in Harlem and elsewhere. She believed all women should have the information about birth control that rich women had, hence her lecture to the KKK women."" Ruth Engs, a professor emeritus of applied health science at Indiana University who has studied the eugenics movement, also said O’Brien’s claim was incorrect. ""Margaret Sanger, as far as I know, was never  a member of the Klan. She would speak to any group who was interested in how to control their reproduction. This includes immigrant groups, black groups, church groups, in addition to professionals, physicians,"" she wrote in an email. Author Edwin Black, whose 2003 book War Against the Weak paints a scathing portrait of the American eugenics movement, criticizes Sanger harshly in its pages for her eugenic beliefs. Ultimately, though, he writes, ""Sanger was no racist. Nor was she anti-Semitic."" Contacted for comment, O’Brien referred to two articles online, one a piece from the American Spectator and the other an entry on a blog that has no other content. The Spectator article mostly refers to the passages from the autobiography, although it leaves out the paragraph in which Sanger compares her audience to children. It also treats the women’s branch of the Ku Klux Klan and the actual Klan as one and the same. The blog includes similar content, along with information about the effect of abortions on the African American community. We should note, however, that no Planned Parenthood chapter offered abortions until 1970, four years after Sanger’s death. O’Brien and the sources he cited all highlight a comment made by Sanger in a Dec. 10, 1939, letter. In it, she writes, ""We don’t want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs."" A 2011 PolitFact Georgia article examined this statement and found it was actually innocuous. ""Sanger’s correspondence shows this sentence advocates for black doctors and ministers to play leadership roles in the Negro Project to avoid misunderstandings. Lynchings and Jim Crow laws gave blacks good reason to be wary of attempts to limit the number of children they bore. In Harlem, she hired a black doctor and social worker to quell those fears,"" the article states. We should also note that in 1966, while she was still alive, Planned Parenthood bestowed the Margaret Sanger award on Martin Luther King Jr. He accepted, and while he was unable to attend the event, his wife Coretta showed up in his place to read his speech. In it, King wrote: ""There is a striking kinship between our movement and Margaret Sanger's early efforts. She, like we, saw the horrifying conditions of ghetto life. Like we, she knew that all of society is poisoned by cancerous slums. Like we, she was a direct actionist – a nonviolent resister."" Given the fact that Sanger’s autobiography had been published nearly 30 years before King’s speech, her earlier address was no secret. It should be clear the civil rights leader did not think of Sanger as a racist. In addition to the links O’Brien shared, he also threw a little vitriol our way. ""These facts won’t stop your defamatory attacks in your article or in the future,"" he said through his Facebook account in response to an inquiry for this article . ""Your article is certainly already written and will be yet another attack piece intended to satiate the prejudices of the narrower band of the electorate who care what the Concord Monitor has to say."" Our ruling Former New Hampshire Speaker of the House William O’Brien wrote that  Margaret Sanger was the founder of Planned Parenthood and ""an active participant in the Klu Klux Klan."" Birth-control advocate Sanger did give a speech to a women’s branch of the KKK and she was a believer in eugenics. However, her writings and other contemporary evidence make clear that she was not ideologically in tune with the Klan -- much less an ""active participant."" O’Brien’s claim goes far beyond the evidence. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097819680>],/factchecks/2015/mar/18/william-obrien/nh-rep-bill-obrien-says-margaret-sanger-was-active/

Teen alcohol abuse in Florida has dropped by double digits, advocate says
","As the Legislature considers changing rules for Florida’s burgeoning craft beer industry, one advocacy group is saying it’s important to maintain the state’s downward trend in teen alcohol abuse. During debate at the Senate commerce and tourism committee about whether to let breweries sell 64-ounce growlers, Susan Pitman, a board member for a collection of drug abuse prevention groups called the Florida Coalition Alliance, urged lawmakers to consider limiting pour sizes in beer-tasting rooms. Pitman said that preventing alcohol abuse demands regulation of these tasting rooms. ""While the country as a whole has seen a decline in youth drinking, the state of Florida is a leader, with double-digit drops in 30-day teen alcohol use,"" she said. Pitman’s arguments may have had some impact; sponsor Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, agreed to revisit his bill. But in the meantime, we wondered: Has the declining drinking rate of Florida’s minors really dropped as much as Pitman said? (We considered checking whether Florida’s decline made it a ""leader"" among states, but we backed off after we learned that the state and national numbers -- which also are on the decline -- aren’t precisely comparable.) Pitman, who also serves as executive director of Jacksonville-based Drug Free Duval, told PolitiFact Florida that she got her talking point from the Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey. That’s an annual questionnaire given to middle and high school students in order to collect data about risky behaviors, such as smoking and drug use. The survey is coordinated by the state departments of Children and Families, Education, Health, Juvenile Justice and the Governor's Office of Drug Control. The 2014 report is drawn from answers from almost 70,000 Florida students from all 67 counties. There are several questions measuring alcohol use, including binge drinking and whether kids have ever tried alcohol. But in the category Pitman cites -- the percentage of children who had used alcohol during the past 30 days -- the data show a distinct decrease over the last decade. Grade 2004 2014 Decline, 2004-2014 Middle schoolers 20.3 percent 10.1 percent 10.2 points High schoolers 42.0 percent 28.4 percent 13.6 points That’s a double-digit drop for both categories, providing strong evidence for Pitman’s claim. The only caveat is that there’s a different data set that leads to slightly different results. Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention undertakes a survey for the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. It’s conducted every odd-numbered year during the spring semester for grades 9-12 and for middle schoolers. The 2013 data was culled from more than 13,000 forms filled out in schools across the United States. The CDC survey doesn’t offer 30-day alcohol data for middle schoolers, but it does for high schoolers. For Florida, the survey found that between 2003 and 2013, alcohol use by high schoolers during the previous 30 days dropped from 42.7 percent to 34.8 percent. That’s a decline of a little under 8 percentage points -- a bit shy of a double-digit drop. Our ruling Pitman said Florida has seen ""double-digit drops"" in alcohol use among teens. A survey conducted by the state does show double-digit drops for both middle- and high-schoolers over the last decade, though the decline for high schoolers in a survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a decline of about 8 percentage points. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097701C80>],/factchecks/2015/mar/18/susan-pitman/teen-alcohol-abuse-has-dropped-double-digits-advoc/

Hannity: Unlike Iran letter response, no one 'got upset' when Nancy Pelosi went to Syria
","Republicans are accusing Democrats of a double standard when they criticize a letter that 47 GOP senators sent to Iranian leaders. The Democratic criticism charges that the senators, in warning Iran’s leadership against a pending nuclear deal, stepped on President Barack Obama’s responsibility for handling foreign policy. But some Republicans counter that Democrats have taken on similar diplomatic efforts. On his show March 10, 2015, Fox News host Sean Hannity said that Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., acted counter to President George W. Bush’s strategy of diplomatically isolating Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, by traveling to Syria in 2007 to open up relations. Pelosi was then the House speaker. Yet this barely caused a ripple at the time, Hannity suggested. ""In 2007, when Nancy Pelosi met with President Assad of Syria against the Bush administration's wishes, nobody got upset,"" Hannity said. ""But now this is the greatest sin of all times, and they're being called traitors in the New York Daily News on their cover."" Hannity was correct to say that Pelosi’s visit with Assad went against Bush administration policy. At the time, the administration had adopted a strategy of diplomatically isolating Syria and not engaging in direct talks with Assad, because of the country’s role in conflicts in Lebanon and Iraq. Pelosi’s office has pushed back against Hannity’s claim that Pelosi’s visit and the Republicans’ letter to Iran are equivalent. But we won’t delve into that question here.   Instead, we’re going to look at whether Hannity was correct to say that ""nobody got upset."" Politicians and staff The reality is that Republicans -- and some others -- at the time said Pelosi went beyond the role of representative and stepped unwelcome into the role of secretary of state. For starters, the Bush administration spoke out publicly against the 2007 trip. Addressing reporters in reference to Pelosi’s trip, Bush himself said, ""Sending delegations hasn’t worked,"" according to the New York Times. ""It’s just simply been counterproductive."" Vice President Dick Cheney also offered a harsh critique in an interview with radio host Rush Limbaugh. ""I'm obviously disappointed,"" Cheney said. ""I think it is, in fact, bad behavior on her part. I wish she hadn't done it, but she is the speaker of the House, and fortunately I think the various parties involved recognize she doesn't speak for the United States in those circumstances. She doesn't represent the administration. The president is the one that conducts foreign policy, not the speaker of the House."" On CBS, White House counselor Dan Bartlett said, ""We did ask her not to go. We did not believe it would advance the diplomatic efforts in the Middle East. I think most Americans would not think that the leader of the Democratic Party in the Congress should be meeting with the heads of a state sponsor of terror."" Media In addition, both mainstream and the conservative media criticized Pelosi for the trip -- covering the back-and-forth extensively on the editorial pages, nightly shows and the Sunday political talk shows. Here are a few examples: • The Washington Post editorial board: ""The really striking development here is the attempt by a Democratic congressional leader to substitute her own foreign policy for that of a sitting Republican president…. Ms. Pelosi's attempt to establish a shadow presidency is not only counterproductive, it is foolish."" • The Wall Street Journal editorial board: ""What was Ms. Pelosi hoping to accomplish other than embarrassing President Bush? With her trip, Ms. Pelosi has now reassured the Syrian strongman that Mr. Bush lacks the domestic support to impose any further pressure on his country."" • Former Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan: The trip was a ""thumb in the eye of the president of the United States, and it does send a mixed message."" • Former Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., in an interview with Hannity: ""I don't understand why, as speaker of the House, she would be going to see a dictator in Damascus when the White House has publicly asked her not to go there."" • Then-Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.: ""I believe her visit to Syria was a mistake, that it was bad for the United States of America and good for the Syrians."" Hannity himself Hannity, one of the most popular hosts at the cable news network with the highest ratings, also addressed the trip on several occasions. On his show April 5, 2007, Hannity said Pelosi’s intention by taking the trip was to embarrass Bush. Two days later, Hannity called Pelosi the ""Diva of Damascus"" who was ""conducting her own foreign policy"" that was ""dangerous for America."" And on April 12, 2007, he accused Pelosi of ""making friends with America’s enemies."" ""Why is the San Francisco liberal willing to compromise with radicals and apparently not the president?"" he said. Through a spokeswoman, Hannity told PolitiFact that he was specifically referring to comments made in support of Pelosi’s trip by Obama and Hillary Clinton, then both serving in the Senate. Hannity does have a point that Clinton (and some other Democrats, as noted by The Daily Show) did support Pelosi’s trip yet have spoken out against the Iran letter. For instance, in 2007, future Secretary of State Clinton said, ""I applaud Speaker Pelosi. I have long advocated engagement with countries in the region, including Iran and Syria. By contrast, Clinton said of the Iran letter, ""Either these senators were trying to be helpful to the Iranians or harmful to the commander-in-chief."" For a reminder that nothing is ever entirely new in politics, check out this passage from an April 2007 New York Times article about Pelosi’s Syria trip: ""Democrats say the complaints have a certain political expediency to them, and note that many of the same people criticizing Ms. Pelosi’s decision to delve into foreign policy were fine when Newt Gingrich, then the Republican speaker of the House, made his own foray into foreign policy back in 1997."" Our ruling Hannity said that in 2007, when Nancy Pelosi met with President Assad of Syria, ""nobody got upset."" In reality, many politicians, pundits and editorial boards spoke out against Pelosi’s trip, including Bush and Cheney. Hannity told PolitiFact that he was referring specifically to comments made in support of Pelosi’s trip by Obama and Hillary Clinton. However, that point would not have been obvious to viewers watching the show. Rating Hannity on what he actually said on television, we find his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3A2540>],/factchecks/2015/mar/18/sean-hannity/hannity-unlike-iran-letter-response-no-one-got-ups/

Lena Taylor: Most NRA members back background checks on all gun purchases
","A bill that Gov. Scott Walker appears to favor would scrap a nearly 40-year-old Wisconsin law that requires a 48-hour waiting period for handgun purchases. Some opposition has emerged. In an unscientific poll on JSOnline, the website of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 70 percent of the more than 2,200 votes cast were for keeping the waiting period in place. The next day, March 12, 2015, state Sen. Lena Taylor expressed her opposition -- suggesting that even most members of the National Rifle Association, which fights restrictions on the right to bear handguns as well as long guns, would side with her against the bill. The Milwaukee Democrat issued a statement after the Republican-sponsored bill was approved by the Senate Judicial and Public Safety Committee in a 3-2 party-line vote. ""Not including background checks (of) all types of firearms, ignoring the public safety and the mental health needs of our state is downright irresponsible,"" said Taylor, who cast one of the no votes. ""Polling showed that even nearly 74 percent of NRA members support requiring background checks for all gun sales."" Setting aside the fact Taylor is muddying the waters by implying a background check would go away -- it won’t -- let’s check her statistic on polling for NRA member support for such measures. Background checks Under federal law, states decide whether they want to process background checks to ensure that people who are prohibited by law from owning guns do not purchase one. In Wisconsin, the state Department of Justice does the checks for handguns, while the FBI does them for long guns. The state’s check of handgun purchasers includes a more extensive review of databases, such as those involving offenses committed by juveniles, than the FBI routinely does. The most recent state figures show that from July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014, the state processed more than 196,000 background checks for handgun purchases. More than 99 percent of the applications were approved, including more than 29,000 that were approved instantly. The Department of Justice has said that on average, the background checks are done within four hours. The new legislation would not change the requirement for background checks. Supporters say that in most cases, since the checks are done quickly, there is no reason for people to have to wait 48 hours to take possession of the handgun they’re buying. Opponents worry about instances such as a couple getting in an argument and then running out to buy guns before they have a chance to cool off. The polling Now to what recent polling on background checks has found among the several million members of the politically powerful NRA. In March 2013, Lee Leffingwell, then the mayor of Austin, Texas, made a two-part claim that includes the claim Taylor made. He said 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of NRA members support background checks of gun purchasers. PolitiFact Texas rated his claim True. The key evidence was an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on a poll done in January 2013 by two entities at Johns Hopkins University -- the Department of Health Policy and Management and the Center for Gun Policy and Research. The poll was conducted online among 2,703 adults -- including 169 NRA members -- through GfK Knowledge Networks, which specializes in working with academic and government researchers to do polling online. It recruits participants randomly via mail and telephone. The poll found that 74 percent (to be precise, 73.7 percent) of NRA members supported requiring background checks for all gun sales. (The margin of error was seven points.) This poll was the most on point that we could find in terms of Taylor’s claim. But we would also note two others done around the same time that included information on NRA households -- in other words, the person responding to the survey or someone in that household was an NRA member at the time. A CBS News/New York Times poll, also from January 2013, found that background checks on all potential gun buyers were favored by 85 percent of NRA households. And a February 2013 poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that 74 percent of people in NRA households favored making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks.  The NRA did not respond to our requests about Taylor’s claim. But as an organization, it opposes universal background checks. Two days after Taylor issued her statement, the NRA urged its members to oppose newly introduced legislation in Congress that would extend background checks to cover gun transactions at gun shows, over the Internet and in other settings. The statement on the NRA website said the federal bill ""does not address the real problems of fixing the broken mental health system and prosecuting criminals. Further, criminals will never submit to such a system so it will never truly be ‘universal.’""    Our rating Taylor said polling shows that nearly 74 percent of National Rifle Association members ""support requiring background checks for all gun sales."" The most recent national poll of NRA members that we could find, done in January 2013 by Johns Hopkins University, found that 73.7 percent of the members supported requiring background checks for all gun sales. We rate Taylor’s statement True. Update: After this item was published, NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker called us contending that the Johns Hopkins poll could not accurately survey NRA members because only the NRA has access to the list of current, dues-paying members. We are not adjusting our rating, as it is a common practice in polling to ask respondents to identify whether they are members of, for example, a political party or other group.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096CF6A40>],/factchecks/2015/mar/18/lena-taylor/most-nra-members-back-background-checks-all-gun-pu/

James Webb says stock market has tripled in value since 2009
","Many Americans believe that the economic recovery has only recently picked up steam. But one group that is widely seen as benefiting in recent years are investors in the stock market. This is a point that former Sen. James Webb, D-Va. -- a potential longshot candidate for president who’s been taking an economic-populist approach -- made during an interview on ABC’s This Week. On the March 15, 2015, edition of the show, host George Stephanopoulos brought up a comment by Webb that ""powerful financial interests spending billions to elect people who think the current drift toward a permanent aristocracy is OK."" Webb explained his thinking this way: ""If you see what has been happening to our country over the past 20 or 25 years or so, with the economic model -- first, the model itself has broken apart. ... The employment model that was based on full-time employment, manufacturing-based, taking care of your working people, (it) fell apart a lot, when the manufacturing sector itself was hurt so bad in the past 20 years. ""But the other thing is … if you have capital, if you have assets, you're doing pretty well. The stock market has almost tripled since April of 2009. If you don't -- and this is particularly true right now with the generation that is coming into full adulthood -- they don't have that model anymore. They are doing part-time jobs, consultancy jobs, they've got student loans to pay off."" We wondered whether Webb was right that ""the stock market has almost tripled since April of 2009."" So we looked back at the historical data. First, some background on the stock market. Companies that are publicly traded allow ownership shares to be sold on one of several stock exchanges. The values of a single share can rise or fall over time. Several different indexes are commonly used to measure the overall value of the market. We looked at four: the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is a smaller group of blue-chip stocks; the Standard & Poors 500, which offers a larger and broader mix of stocks; the NASDAQ Composite, which includes a lot of fast-growing technology stocks; and the Wilshire 5000, which includes the broadest list of publicly traded companies. The following table summarizes the growth of these three measurements between April 1, 2009, and today.   Measure April 1, 2009 March 16, 2015 Increase (multiple) Dow Jones Industrial Average 7,762 17,977 2.3 times higher Standard & Poors 500 811 2,081 2.6 times higher NASDAQ Composite 1,552 4,930 3.2 times higher Wilshire 5000 8242 21949 2.7 times higher These numbers show that Webb is definitely right for the NASDAQ Composite (in fact, he underestimates a bit) and that he’s just about on target for the S&P 500 and the Wilshire 5000 if you round the figures upwards. Webb’s claim that the stock market ""almost tripled"" overshoots the increase for the Dow, which is 2.3 times higher now than in April 2009. Still, Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University’s Stern School of Business, warned that comparisons like Webb’s are sensitive to the choice of start and end dates, among other issues. ""For example, if one takes the Dow Jones Industrial Average and instead makes the comparison with its previous high in 2007, the increase is only 25 percent -- not the more-than doubling that occurred from its low point in 2009,"" he said. ""And if one nets out inflation from that 25 percent increase, the 'real' increase in the stock market has been only about half of that increase."" Our ruling Webb said that ""the stock market has almost tripled since April of 2009."" There are different ways to measure ""the stock market."" For three of the four most common yardsticks, Webb is basically right; for the other one, he’s off base, but not dramatically so. And it's worth noting that the period Webb chose maximizes the increase; a longer time horizon makes the gain more modest. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D4FB00>],/factchecks/2015/mar/17/jim-webb/james-webb-says-stock-market-has-tripled-value-200/

Mitch McConnell: John Kerry visited Nicaragua in 1980s to accuse Reagan of 'enaging in terrorism'
","The controversy over a letter to Iran’s leaders signed by 47 Republican senators prompted a sudden surge of interest in past efforts by lawmakers to meet with foreign leaders. After taking hits from many Democrats and some Republicans who said the letter unwisely undercut President Barack Obama’s negotiations with Iran over its nuclear capabilities, Republicans pushed back with examples of congressional Democrats engaged in overseas freelancing when Republicans held the White House. For instance, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh charged that the late Democratic senator Ted Kennedy ""sent a letter to then Soviet leader Yuri Andropov apologizing for Ronald Reagan and begging the Soviets not to overreact."" We rated that claim False. Other claims have involved House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other lawmakers. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., appeared on CNN’s State of the Union on March 15 to answer questions from host Dana Bash about what she called the ""rushed way"" the letter was circulated as senators were trying to get out of town for a snowstorm. She asked McConnell to explain the process, but McConnell began by sidestepping her question. ""Well, Dana, first, let me just say, I think this is a good case of selective outrage,"" McConnell said. ""I remember reading about Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) when he was the majority leader flying to Moscow during the negotiations over the SALT II treaty, explaining to the Russians the Senate's role in treaty ratification. And John Kerry, when he was a senator, flew to Managua and met with a communist dictator there, Daniel Ortega, and accused the Reagan administration of engaging in terrorism. So, look, members of Congress expressing themselves about important matters, not only at home, but around the world, is not unprecedented."" Since Kerry, many years later, is a central player in the Iran negotiations, we decided to focus on the claim that referenced him. (Indeed, on Sunday, Kerry said on CBS’s Face the Nation that the letter from the 47 senators ""was absolutely calculated directly to interfere with these negotiations. … That is unprecedented."") There are some differences between the recent examples and the Kerry visit -- including the fact that the Nicaragua episode involved two individual lawmakers rather than 87 percent of the Senate GOP caucus, including the majority leader. But we’ll leave it to readers to judge whether McConnell’s comparison is apt. Here, we’ll look instead at the more straightforward factual question of whether Kerry, ""when he was a senator, flew to Managua and met with a communist dictator there, Daniel Ortega, and accused the Reagan administration of engaging in terrorism."" When we dug into the archives, we found that the episode in question occurred almost exactly 30 years ago, in April 1985. It came at a time when Ortega, Nicaragua’s communist strongman, was being challenged by a U.S.-aligned rebel movement known as the Contras. (Now, after a period out of office in the 1990s, Ortega is once again Nicaragua’s president.) Here’s how the Associated Press covered Kerry’s comments in an April 16, 1985, dispatch: ""Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., said Monday he and another Vietnam-era veteran, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, plan to go to Nicaragua this week in part because of worries the United States is repeating the mistakes of Vietnam in Central America. ""Kerry said he and Harkin plan to meet with Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and with business, church and opposition leaders. ""Their trip comes the week before the Senate is scheduled to vote on President Reagan's request for an additional $14 million in aid to the ‘contra’ rebels seeking to overthrow Ortega's leftist government. ""Sen. Harkin and I are going to Nicaragua as Vietnam-era veterans who are alarmed that the Reagan administration is repeating the mistakes we made in Vietnam,"" Kerry said. ""Our foreign policy should represent the democratic values that have made our country great, not subvert those values by funding terrorism to overthrow governments of other countries,"" Kerry said. … Kerry said he and Harkin plan to leave Thursday for Nicaragua and return on Saturday."" This provides support for what McConnell said. We see only two inaccuracies, both around the margins. First, the way McConnell structured his claim suggests that Kerry made these statements after flying to Managua. In reality, the AP article makes it clear that he made the statement in the days before he and Harkin left for Managua. Second, McConnell could have been more precise in how he relayed Kerry’s use of the word ""terrorism."" McConnell said Kerry ""accused the Reagan administration of engaging in terrorism."" That’s a slight exaggeration of Kerry’s words. Kerry actually said that the Reagan administration was ""funding terrorism to overthrow governments of other countries."" A slight rhetorical difference, but a difference nonetheless. Still, McConnell’s claim is pretty close to the mark. Kerry’s staff did not dispute the accuracy of the AP report. They did point PolitiFact to an April 24, 1985, Washington Post story about the votes on the Contra aid bill. The article noted that the late Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., said it was ""wrong, wrong, wrong"" for Kerry and Harkin to visit Nicaragua the previous week and return with a negotiating proposal from President Daniel Ortega. According to the Post article, ""Kerry responded by reading a letter from Secretary of State George P. Shultz endorsing the idea of congressional visits to all Central American nations, including Nicaragua."" Kerry’s comments at the time appear to accurately portray what Schultz wrote. Here’s an excerpt; the full text is available here. ""I strongly encourage members of Congress, of both parties and regardless of their views on Central America, to visit not only Nicaragua but all of the countries of the region,"" Schultz wrote. ""I would urge them to spend as much time there as their schedules will permit, to travel outside the capitals, and to talk with citizens in and out of government and of all political persuasions in order to better understand the difficult issues we must all resolve in forgoing a bipartisan policy on Central America. The Department of State will be pleased to assist members of Congress with their travel in any way possible."" Our ruling McConnell said Secretary of State John Kerry, ""when he was a senator, flew to Managua and met with a communist dictator there, Daniel Ortega, and accused the Reagan administration of engaging in terrorism."" We aren’t comparing Kerry’s Nicaraguan visit to the recent Republican senators’ letter to Iran’s leadership. But on the facts, McConnell got it mostly right, with two imperfections on the margins, regarding both the timeline and the exact phrasing of Kerry’s charge against the Reagan administration. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967212C0>],/factchecks/2015/mar/16/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-john-kerry-visited-nicaragua-1980s/

House education chair blames Florida testing delays on cyber attack only
","On day 1 of the new computerized standardized tests in Florida, students and administrators across the state couldn’t log on to the tests, forcing some districts to postpone the assessments. The problems that started March 2 spanned the state and hit Florida's largest counties including Miami-Dade, Broward and Hillsborough. Initial reports were that it was a technical glitch in the hands of the testing vendor, American Institutes for Research. But by the end of the week, state law enforcement were also investigating a cyber security attack. Miami-Dade Superintendent Alberto Carvalho would later call it a ""catastrophic meltdown,"" and the testing problems added more fuel to the fire about Florida’s focus on tests. During a House Education Appropriations Committee meeting March 12, chairwoman and state Rep. H. Marlene O'Toole, R-Lady Lake, put the blame solely on the cyber attack. ""On the testing problems, many of you may have read in the media, that the problem was not that of a vendor, the problem was not that of the test materials itself, it was the product of a cyber attack,"" she said. O’Toole’s claim suggested that the sole problem was the cyber attack, but that conflicted with news reports and information provided by the state Department of Education. The testing woes Whether K-12 students are taking too many tests is a hot topic during this legislative session, with many teachers and parents pushing for fewer tests. Gov. Rick Scott promised during his 2014 campaign to investigate every statewide test and in February ordered the state to stop giving an 11th-grade Florida Standards Assessment for language arts. This year, students started taking the Florida Standards Assessments aligned to Florida's new education benchmarks, based on the Common Core State Standards. The new tests replaced the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Tests. Testing started on Monday, March 2 -- and was an instant mess. The problems occurred on the computer-based tests given in grades 8-10 when they couldn’t log on to the testing platform. The Tampa Bay Times reported that testing problems occurred in more than half of the districts. The state sent districts an email Tuesday morning saying that the testing vendor, AIR, had fixed software problems the day before. But the problems persisted in some places. ""What happened was AIR did an update to their system the day before testing began,"" Stewart explained to a House education committee March 5. ""Admittedly that was the wrong timing, and it caused them some issues with data retrieval."" AIR issued a statement to the media, including PolitiFact Florida, accepting ""full responsibility"" for the technical difficulties. ""Ultimately, we concluded that an update we performed had inadvertently degraded system performance, resulting in the delays districts experienced. Once we were able to identify the problem, we promptly resolved it,"" a spokesman wrote. But on March 9 -- one week after the testing troubles began -- Stewart sent a press release stating that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement was investigating testing delays caused by cyber-attacks on a server used to administer the test. Stewart wrote that ""some of the delays in testing"" were due to cyber-attacks and repeated that AIR’s system update had resulted in the initial delays Monday and Tuesday. ""By Tuesday afternoon, the issue with the log on server was resolved,"" Stewart wrote. ""While there were some sporadic reports of denial of service on Monday and Tuesday, significant concerns of an attack did not occur until Thursday morning when DOE received widespread reports from a number of districts of ‘white screens’ after logging in. By approximately 8:30 a.m. Thursday, the problem had subsided and the districts that continued were able to test successfully for the rest of the day. AIR confirmed the cause of this issue was a cyber-attack on the log on server."" AIR told PolitiFact Florida that the cyber-attack was launched against a firewall that protects the servers. ""There was no attempt to infiltrate the firewall, but rather to make the website unavailable by flooding the firewall with nonsense connections,"" an AIR spokesman said. School districts have a two-week window to deliver the tests, and as of the middle of the second week, about 87 percent of the students had taken the tests. We sent portions of Stewart’s press release to O’Toole spokesman Joshua Blake, who said she misspoke during the committee. ""I intended to convey that a cyber-attack was reported to have played a role in those initial difficulties, but the numbers show that 87 percent have completed the test as of yesterday, and I am encouraged by that number,"" O'Toole said in a statement provided by Blake. Our ruling O’Toole said that the testing ""problem was not that of a vendor, the problem was not that of the test materials itself, it was the product of a cyber attack."" Actually, a vendor update was responsible for the initial problems that kept students from logging onto the new testing system. The cyber attack was another problem that happened later in the week. O’Toole admitted she misspoke. There is an element of truth here because the cyber attack did create problems, but it wasn’t the only culprit. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4E3100>],/factchecks/2015/mar/16/h-marlene-otoole/house-education-chair-blames-florida-testing-delay/

Tom Cotton says Susan Rice 'conceded' that under nuclear deal, Iran would have 'robust' enrichment
","In the space of a few days, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. -- who only won his office four months ago -- became a central player in the drama over a potential nuclear deal with Iran. Cotton spearheaded a letter to Iran’s leaders that was ultimately signed by 47 Republican senators saying that Congress could ultimately overrule any agreement. Democrats said the letter undermined presidential authority to carry out foreign policy. On March 9, 2015, shortly after news of the letter broke, Cotton appeared on Fox News Channel and said this: ""We don't know what the final terms of the deal are. But we know so far that Susan Rice, the president's national security adviser, has already conceded that Iran will have a robust uranium enrichment capability. The president has said this bill will have a sunset, perhaps as little as 10 years (from now). Those two terms alone make this deal unacceptable."" We see two related but distinct questions here. The first one is easier: Did Rice literally say what Cotton said she did? The second is trickier: Is what Rice said functionally equivalent to what Cotton claimed? Outline of the negotiations First, some background on the Iran nuclear negotiations. In November 2013, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany, known as the P5+1, joined with Iran in signing an agreement that temporarily stopped Iran’s production of potentially weapons-grade nuclear material. In 2014, that agreement was extended, with continued sanctions relief, including the ability to sell oil and to gain access to assets frozen in overseas bank accounts, and some additional nuclear steps by Iran. This interim agreement expires in June. Under the interim deal, Iran was cleared to continue enriching uranium, though only to the diluted level of 5 percent and with its stockpile capped. That falls well short of what weapon makers would need to create a bomb. On the other hand, critics of the deal say the first 5 percent enrichment is the toughest, meaning it would be comparatively easy for Iran to reach 90 percent once it got to 5 percent. Still, supporters of the administration’s approach counter that it would take Iran roughly a year to make a bomb, leaving time for the world to detect what’s happening and respond.   Rice’s speech to AIPAC Cotton’s office didn’t return two inquiries, but we found a quote by Rice that seems to be the one Cotton is referencing; it attracted attention in both the conservative and mainstream media. Rice made the remarks  in a March 2 speech to a convention of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, an influential pro-Israel group that includes many skeptics of President Barack Obama’s approach: ""We cannot let a totally unachievable ideal stand in the way of a good deal. I know that some of you will be urging Congress to insist that Iran forego its domestic enrichment capacity entirely.  But, as desirable as that would be, it is neither realistic nor achievable. Even our closest international partners in the P5+1 (the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China and Germany) do not support denying Iran the ability ever to pursue peaceful nuclear energy. If that is our goal, our partners will abandon us, undermining the sanctions we have imposed so effectively together. Simply put, that is not a viable negotiating position. Nor is it even attainable. The plain fact is, no one can make Iran unlearn the scientific and nuclear expertise it already possesses."" This makes it clear that Rice didn’t use the word ""robust."" Two arms-control experts agreed that Cotton was taking liberties with Rice’s words. ""I think Cotton exaggerated what Rice said,"" said Richard Nephew, the program director for economic statecraft, sanctions and energy markets at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. "" 'Robust' has a connotation that, to me, means more than just a capability. I use the term ‘robust’ to mean ‘healthy’ or ‘strong.’ What exactly that means probably depends on the eye of the beholder, but to me, ‘robust’ evokes some real weight, which isn't what Rice said."" Matthew Bunn, an arms-control specialist at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, agreed that Cotton was ""clearly incorrect"" in how he quoted Rice. ""If this is the quote Cotton was referring to, he’s simply wrong about what she said. She said they won’t have zero, not that they will have a ‘robust’ capability,"" Bunn said. The White House told PolitiFact that Cotton embellished Rice’s words. ""Our goal is to effectively shut down the four pathways to fissile material for a nuclear weapon:  uranium enrichment at Natanz; uranium enrichment at Fordow; the plutonium pathway; and the possibility of a covert pathway,"" said National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan. ""We seek to do this by extending Iran’s breakout time to at least one year – which is significantly longer than what experts have publicly estimated is Iran’s current breakout time of approximately two to three months."" Was Cotton’s implication reasonable? Rice argued in her speech that it’s unrealistic to expect diplomacy to reduce Iran’s enrichment capability to zero. But do nuclear experts believe that any amount of enrichment capability greater than zero is inherently ""robust""? Or is there a sweet spot between ""zero"" and ""robust"" in which Iran’s potential nuclear-bomb ambitions would be weakened to the point of inefficacy? The experts we checked with said there probably is such a sweet spot, but they cautioned that it’s hard to know for sure. Nephew and Bunn said the enrichment capabilities currently envisioned would, combined with the restrictions and monitoring established under the agreement, leave Iran with about a year’s work to make material for a bomb at its inspected facilities. That, Bunn argued, would give the world time to notice what’s going on and respond, and ""would effectively take that option off the table for Iran."" A greater risk, Bunn said, is that if Iran decides to go full-steam ahead on building a bomb, ""it is far more likely to build a secret site for that purpose, rather than trying to do it with the world knowing what they are doing at facilities that could readily be bombed."" To be sure, that’s a worrisome scenario -- but it’s also one that doesn’t depend on how much enrichment capability is allowed under the deal currently being negotiated. Ultimately, there are too many unknowns to say with any certainty how ""robust"" Iran’s enrichment capability would be -- starting with the fact that the negotiations are still ongoing, said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security. ""The meaning of ‘robust’ is in the eye of the beholder,"" Albright said. ""But knowing for sure who is right depends on knowing how much nuclear infrastructure will remain and what are the limits on its operation. We cannot know that for sure until we see a deal."" Our ruling Cotton said, ""Susan Rice, the president's national security adviser, has already conceded that Iran will have a robust uranium enrichment capability."" Cotton essentially puts words in Rice’s mouth when he says she ""conceded"" that Iran will keep a ""robust"" enrichment capability. She didn’t use those words in the AIPAC speech. Meanwhile, what she did say -- that zero enrichment capability, ""as desirable as that would be, it is neither realistic nor achievable"" -- may or may not lead to Cotton’s conclusion that Iran will be left with a ""robust"" capability. Experts expect that there is a point between ""zero"" and ""robust"" where Iran’s nuclear ambitions are hampered, but there are too many variables and too much uncertainty to say so with certainty. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False. Note: This claim was fact-checked as part of a reward to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union.

Wisconsin 'dead last' in the Midwest in creating jobs?
","When it comes to Madison Democrats making pronouncements about job growth in Wisconsin, the term ""dead last"" has a recurring allure. Mary Burke relentlessly made dead-last claims while running against Gov. Scott Walker in the 2014 election. In checking two of them, which were made with some variation, we rated one True and the other False. Now comes U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan. On March 10, 2015, the day after Walker signed legislation that bars private-sector workers from being required to pay union fees, Pocan appeared on a Wisconsin Public Radio talk show. Host Joy Cardin asked Pocan why he thinks the so-called right-to-work law ""is going to be bad for Wisconsin."" Pocan, who opposed the measure, began his reply by saying:
  ""Well, first of all, I think Governor Walker has taken us down the path of his presidential aspirations, and I feel that he is really ignoring the needs of Wisconsin. We're dead last in the Midwest for job creation."" ""Dead last"" just won’t die. OK, we’re game for another go at this. So, four months after the election and with Walker positioning himself for a White House run in 2016, where does Wisconsin rank now? The numbers Pocan’s office pointed us to two news articles, both from December 2014, that reported on federal data for the private sector -- that is, non-government, non-farm jobs. The data is from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which tracks the economy in rolling 12-month increments. The measurements are done every three months, but they also lag by many months. The quarterly figures have been called the gold standard because they are based on a census of 96 percent of the nation's employers in the public and private sectors. That means the  data is far more reliable than monthly jobs data, which are based on a sample of only 3 percent of employers and are often subject to significant revisions. In examining the quarterly figures, we focus on the percentage increase in private sector jobs, rather than raw numbers, an approach that levels the playing field among states of varying sizes. Pocan referred to the latest available quarterly data, which measures job growth from June 2013 to June 2014. So what do the figures show? Among the 10 Midwestern states we’ve checked on previous ""dead last"" claims, Wisconsin is at the bottom, if not ""dead last"":   State Percentage of private-sector job growth, June 2013-June 2014 1. North Dakota 4.8 2. Michigan 2.7 3. (tie) Indiana, Iowa 1.8 5. Illinois 1.7 6. (tie) Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio 1.6 9. (tie) Wisconsin, South Dakota 1.5 
Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick responded to Pocan's claim by pointing out that Wisconsin ranked sixth among the 10 -- ahead of Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota and North Dakota -- in raw numbers of jobs created. But again, that approach doesn't take into account how the states differ in size. Indeed, those four states are all smaller in population than Wisconsin. It’s worth noting that the less-reliable monthly job figures indicate Wisconsin is on the upswing. Employers added 40,600 jobs during the last four months of 2014 -- which was more than were added in the full year in any of the first three years of Walker's first term. But it is certainly fair for Pocan to use the most recent release of the most reliable numbers. The next batch, covering the third quarter of 2014, is scheduled to be released March 19, 2015. Our rating Pocan said Wisconsin is ""dead last in the Midwest for job creation."" Among 10 Midwestern states -- in terms of percentage growth in private-sector jobs -- the latest figures show Wisconsin is tied for ninth. So, not quite ""dead last."" We rate Pocan’s statement Mostly True.

Bill would nix consumers' tax break on electric vehicles but simliar credit for business remains
","With state lawmakers revving up plans to tackle Georgia’s underfunded transportation system, some readers are confused about the often-changing plan. As it stands, the House has passed HB 170 to raise about $700 million next year toward a $1 billion annual need to maintain existing roads and bridges. The proposal is now before the Senate, which could adjust or completely overhaul the proposed taxes and cuts in the legislation. One alert reader reached out on Twitter, remembering a claim in a story earlier this year and wondering if the House version still revokes a tax-credit for consumers’ electric cars, while leaving a similar break in place for businesses. PolitiFact Georgia decided to check it out. The necessity of tax hikes has long threatened talk of tackling the state’s backlog of transportation projects and resulting gridlock. Amendments that would have undercut the tax rates in HB 170 were introduced right up until the House approved the proposal intact. As is, the legislation would eliminate the state percent sales tax on gasoline and replace it with an excise tax of 29.2 cents per gallon. Key to our question, it also would eliminate the popular $5,000 state tax credit for all-electric vehicles ($2,500 for low-emission vehicles) as of July 1. Owners of low-emission and zero-emission vehicles, meanwhile, would be required to pay a $200 annual registration fee. State Rep. Jay Roberts, R-Ocilla, said that included the changes in the transportation tax bill he pushed through the changes because electric vehicle owners ""practically pay nothing"" to lease and operate those cars. The tax credit cost the state $13.6 million in 2013. When combined with the $7.500 federal tax credit for buying a zero-emission electric vehicle, the state credit covers about 23 percent of the lowest-priced Nissan Leaf. Atlanta was the top market in the nation last year for the Leaf, the nation’s top plug-in electric car, in part due to the generous state tax incentive. Eliminating the credit and adding the annual fee is estimated to generate about $68 million in new revenue in 2016, according to the state Department of Audits and Accounts. Not addressed in the pending legislation, though, is any change to tax credits for businesses. PolitiFact Georgia had to go back to last year’s legislative session to find those breaks. Roberts was among 116 House members (and 41 Senators) who approved House Bill 348 last year. That measure, which Gov. Nathan Deal signed into law last April, provides an income-tax credit of up to $20,000 for firms that purchase a heavy-duty alternative fuel vehicle and $12,000 for the purchase of medium-duty alternative fuel vehicles. The credits are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis and are limited to $2.5 million each year for vehicles that run on electricity, liquid petroleum gas, natural gas or hydrogen. (The break does not include vehicles under 8,500 pounds. That eliminates the Leaf, which weighs between 3,000 and 3,500 pounds, according to various automotive blogging and news web sites.) Those tax credits expire on June 30, 2017. But it took no time for some firms to make good use of the breaks to switch to alt-fuel vehicles. Sandy Springs-based UPS, for instance, said last spring it was buying 1,000 propane-powered delivery trucks as part of a $70 million investment. Those trucks are used in more rural areas, where propane is more readily available, and can go up to 200 miles on a single tank. So that means the current legislation does revoke a tax break available for consumers’ alternative-fuel vehicles, while leaving alone a similar credit for business use. Several studies suggest the Georgia economy actually benefits from both of the tax credits, though. The break for businesses spurs investment and can create the bulk buying that encourage the rest of the market, said Bruce Seaman, an economics professor at Georgia State University. The breaks for consumers’ electric vehicles keep more money in Georgia, in large part because the state does not have a very large interest in the oil industry but does generate a lot of economic activity around electricity. One study, by the Keybridge Public Policy Economics consulting firm, concludes the state stands to lose $107 million to its GDP in the next five years if it eliminates the consumer tax break. Over 16 years, from now until 2030, the amount is $252 million. The analysis also showed that without the credit, Georgia car owners would pay $155 million more to pump gas into their cars in the next five years, offset by saving about $60 million in electricity. That means a double-hit to Georgia’s overall economy: lost fuel savings and an increase in spending on fuel (gas), whose profits leave the state. ""It’s pretty hard, economically, to justify one credit and not the other,"" Seaman said. ""Eliminating the electric vehicle credit is a quest for funding. But it’s short-sighted not to consider the overall economic impacts, especially on commuting and our roads."" Senators may well weigh those considerations as they take up the legislation. House members, too, could discuss changes if the proposal returns to them with any amendments. But the question here is whether, today, Georgia’s transportation legislation eliminates a popular consumer tax credit while retaining a similar break for businesses. It does. One caveat: the tax credit for businesses, which is not mentioned in the latest proposal, would expire in two years anyway. Both of those issues may be the topic of debate to come. But as it stands, we rate the claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A6AFC0>],/factchecks/2015/mar/16/atlanta-journal-constitution/bill-would-nix-consumers-tax-break-electric-vehicl/

Do job-seekers with 'white' names get more callbacks than 'black' names?
","The Sunday shows capped a turbulent week for race relations around the country, from the shooting of two officers in a new wave of protests in Ferguson, Mo., to the closing of a University of Oklahoma fraternity over racist chants. CNN’s State of the Union invited four student leaders to talk about what the next generation can do to improve the dialogue. University of Virginia student council president Jalen Ross pointed out that the most common examples of racial discrimination aren’t limited to dramatic moments that make headlines. ""Every day, a black-name resume is 50 percent less likely to get responded to than a white-name resume,"" Ross said. ""Right? That’s everyday racism."" Ross may not be the typical politician who meets our Truth-O-Meter, but we thought his point was interesting and telling about the state of race relations if true. Ross told PolitiFact by email that he was referencing a field study from the National Bureau of Economic Research called ""Are Emily and Greg more employable than Lakisha and Jamal?"" The study is more than a decade old, published July 2003. Economists Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan wanted to explore racial bias in the job market. They responded to help-wanted ads for a variety of positions in the fields of sales, administrative support, clerical services and customer services posted in The Boston Globe and Chicago Tribune with fake resumes. The researchers plugged in made-up names on the resumes that are associated with African-Americans (they used Lakisha Washington and Jamal Jones as examples) or whites (Emily Walsh and Greg Baker) based on naming data for babies born between 1974-79 in Massachusetts. The name on each resume was randomly assigned, so the same resume in some cases had a black name and in others had a white name.    Then they counted the callbacks. The resumes with white-sounding names spurred 50 percent more callbacks than the ones with black-sounding names. After responding to 1,300 ads with more than 5,000 resumes, the researchers found that the job applicants with white names needed to send 10 resumes to get one callback, but the black candidate needed to send 15 for one. It didn’t matter whether the employer was a federal contractor or was described as an ""equal opportunity employer,"" as those also discriminated like the others. ""We find little evidence that our results are driven by employers inferring something other than race, such as social class, from the names,"" their paper states. ""These results suggest that racial discrimination is still a prominent feature of the labor market."" Ross erred slightly in his exact wording. While white-sounding names spurred 50 percent more callbacks than the ones with black-sounding names, black-sounding names were 33 percent less likely to get responded to. (Thanks percentage change calculators.) The researchers cautioned that their findings do not reveal anything about gaps in hiring rates or earnings between whites and blacks. Also, they only focused on one avenue for job postings, newspaper ads, even though social circles represent a major way people find employment (not to mention that online postings for jobs are much more popular now than 2002). Still, their findings echoed similar preferences among employers for applicants with names that were not distinctively black.  After we published our fact-check, Mullainathan told us by email that Ross's characterization of the study is ""broadly right,"" though it's possible the numbers have changed. ""I know there have been more recent studies but often in other areas (not employment but housing, etc.), and they continue to find large gaps today,"" he said. David Figlio, a Northwestern University professor of education and social policy and of economics, said he had no reason to think the dynamics have substantially changed. ""There have been a number of recent studies on related topics that suggest that similar patterns are still at work in other areas,"" Figlio said. ""So while I can't confirm the exact number, I believe the fundamental relationship to still be true."" We found another National Bureau of Economic Research paper looked at a slightly related angle: whether having a name that sounded African-American posed significant harm for one’s economic well-being. The authors analyzed naming patterns of children born in California from the 1960s to 2000. The names DeShawn, Tyrone, Reginald, Shanice, Kiara, Deja and Precious were very popular black names but ""virtually unheard of"" for white children, they found. Conversely, names such as Connor, Cody, Jake, Molly, Emily, Abigail and Caitlin were way more popular for white children. The differences in name preferences took off with the rise of the Black Power movement in the late 1970s, the authors said. The key difference between the papers is that economists Roland Fryer and Steven D. Levitt found ""little evidence"" that names alone can have a direct effect on one’s economic livelihood, concluding that having a black name is ""primarily a consequence rather than a cause of poverty and segregation."" But the authors said this does not necessarily negate the findings of Bertrand and Mullainathan. They noted that having a black name on its own is not likely to have a big effect throughout the interviewing process, as an employer who meets an applicant and discriminates on race would immediately notice his or her race during the meeting. Also, the fact that Levitt and Fryer did not find a significant impact ""could simply mean that their data aren’t comprehensive enough,"" said Alan Auerbach, a University of California Berkeley economist. Our ruling Ross said, ""Every day, a black name resume is 50 percent less likely to get responded to than a white name resume."" A reputable study by respected economists of callback rates for resumes with white- and black-sounding names backs up this point. Ross' biggest error is his specifc phrasing, while white names were 50 percent more likely to get a call back, that means that black names were 33 percent less likely to do so. Ross made a mistake in his phrasing -- one that tripped us up as well. But his overall point remains valid and the study he relied on showed a sizable discrepancy between white and black sounding names. We rate the claim Mostly True. Correction: Like Ross, we originally made a mistake calculating the percent change conveyed by the study.

The media reaction to George W. Bush's email controversy
","Why is everyone picking on Hillary Clinton -- they didn’t mind when President George W. Bush’s White House also used private email, pundit Juan Williams asked on Fox News Sunday. The show’s March 15, 2015, pundit panel debated the importance of the ongoing controversy regarding Clinton’s decision to exclusively use a private email account, rather than a .gov account, during her time as secretary of state. In doing so, experts say she was able to circumvent transparency and records preservation standards. Williams turned to his fellow commentator, Republican strategist and former Bush adviser Karl Rove, arguing that the email scandal during the Bush administration didn’t garner the same level of media criticism. Thus, the attention on Clinton is unwarranted. ""When Karl was in trouble back in ‘07, (there was) no press coverage, just about zero press coverage of this issue,"" Williams said, noting that he found just one Washington Post editorial criticizing the private email use. ""Juan, you are in a different reality, and I wish that I was there with you,"" Rove said. We decided to look back and see what press coverage of the Bush administration email controversy looked like at the time and how it compares to coverage of Clinton. The Bush email story First, a quick refresher about what happened in the Bush administration. In March 2007, eyes were on then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales after the administration unexpectedly fired eight U.S. attorneys. Congress (recently taken over by Democrats) investigated the firings, alleging that the administration had dropped the prosecutors for political reasons. Over the course of the investigation, it came out that some White House officials had conducted White House business over private email accounts set up on a server through the Republican National Committee. The White House later admitted that some internal White House emails conducted on the RNC server might have been lost. Democrats in Congress accused the administration of purposefully circumventing recordkeeping processes, while the White House said staffers were supposed to use the RNC emails solely for political affairs, not official business. Comparing the Bush and Clinton email scandals is not exactly apples to apples, but there are some similarities. We looked back at media coverage at the time, and Williams has a point that it didn’t cause the same level of hubbub as the Clinton email scandal. Though to say there was ""zero press coverage"" is an exaggeration -- even allowing for a bit of hyperbole. Comparing the coverage We did a search through Lexis-Nexis, a research service that tracks news articles and transcripts, between March and May 2007. We found more than 125 transcripts from the major cable networks and National Public Radio that include ""Republican National Committee"" and ""email"" within 10 words of each other. The Lexis-Nexis search also yielded more than 200 related newspaper articles across the country within the same time frame. Let’s compare that to coverage of the Clinton controversy. Since the story broke March 3, 2015 -- two weeks ago -- we found 204 cable and public radio transcripts that include ""Clinton"" and ""email."" We also found 1,700 newspaper articles across the country. That’s several times as many articles and transcripts about Clinton than there were about the Bush email controversy in a quarter of the time. It’s a rough measurement, but clearly there has been more media attention on Clinton’s use of private email than that of the White House staffers. What about Williams’ reference to the singular Washington Post editorial criticizing the private email use among White House staffers? We found the one editorial, as well as a couple opinion columns. In comparison, the Washington Post has so far written two editorials regarding Clinton’s private email use. Not the same Williams’ argument is that Republicans are stoking the media fire of the Clinton email scandal because they’re worried about Clinton’s 2016 potential, compared to Republican candidates. There’s some nuances and contextual factors that might explain the difference in media coverage. First of all, there’s the difference in who’s at the receiving end of the criticisms. In 2007, it was a group of higher-up White House staffers and advisers (notably Rove) who occasionally used private email accounts for official business. As far as we can tell, though, Bush himself was not suspected as being part of this group. Today, the target is a former secretary of state, who only used private email when conducting official government business. What’s more is that Clinton is in all likelihood running for president in 2016, so she has a lot of media attention on her to begin with. At the time of their email controversy, the Bush administration was past their 2004 second-term election and the 2006 midterms. Additionally, the White House email controversy was on the periphery of a much larger scandal -- the firings of the eight U.S. attorneys. We searched Lexis-Nexis for articles about Attorney General Gonzales in the same time frame that we used to explore coverage of the White House email controversy. The search came up with more than 6,000 combined newspaper articles and transcripts. (Compared to the more than 325 about the emails). As one Washington Post article put it: ""The controversy over the outside e-mail accounts is a byproduct of the ongoing showdown over the prosecutor firings."" Our ruling Williams said there was ""just about zero press coverage"" of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy. We emailed Williams and did not hear back. Saying there was ""zero press coverage"" is an exaggeration -- even allowing for a bit of hyperbole. We found hundreds of articles and television transcripts referencing the issue. Still, Williams has something of a point that compared to the extensive recent coverage of Clinton’s use of private email, media coverage of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy was thin. Williams’ statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809688FB00>],/factchecks/2015/mar/15/juan-williams/media-reaction-george-w-bushs-email-controversy/

Writer says most children in R.I. charter school lotteries are poor, minority
","The expansion of charter schools has been the subject of contentious debate in Rhode Island in recent years. So much so that state lawmakers are fielding a raft of bills this session aiming to limit charter school growth or change their funding method. Cumberland mother and former educator Erika Sanzi weighed in with a March 5, 2015, commentary in The Providence Journal supporting school choice and charter schools. The piece was entitled  ""Taking aim at R.I.'s poor, minority students."" In it, Sanzi faulted the Cumberland School Committee for passing a resolution asking the General Assembly to halt charter school expansion until a new funding mechanism is created. Such a move, would disproportionately impact poor, minority families, she said. She stated, ""Of the 10,000 Rhode Island children in charter school lotteries for the fall, more than 70 percent are poor (indicating that their family’s income qualifies them for free or reduced-priced lunch). In addition, a majority of them are students of color."" We reached out to Sanzi to learn what sources she used to support her statement. We also contacted the Rhode Island League of Charter Schools, which advocates for and supports 18 of the state’s 25 charter schools. We quickly learned that there is no firm data on the race, ethnicity or income levels of the large pool of children who are in the lotteries for charter school slots -- the group Sanzi was talking about. However, there is ample data on the children who actually enroll in the schools. As we’ll see, that helped us evaluate Sanzi’s claim. Stephen A. Nardelli, executive director of the league, told us that the charter school lottery application does not request or require information about a prospective student’s ethnicity or socio-economic status. The league does not track such information, but he said that 11,889 students had applied in 2014 for 1,252 openings and that about 7,000 are enrolled overall. We also reached out to the state Department of Education. The state doesn’t track the ethnicity or economic status of charter school applicants either, Elliot Krieger, a spokesman for the department, said. But the state does calculate the ethnicity and economic status of students enrolled in charter schools. An April 2014 education department report showed that in October 2013, 52 percent of the students were Hispanic; 16 percent were black; and 6 percent were another ethnicity or multi-ethnic, while 26 percent were white. Across Rhode Island, Hispanics comprised 23 percent of the state’s total public school student population, 8 percent were black, 62 percent white and 7 percent were another ethnicity or multi-ethnic, according to the report. That same report showed that 67 percent of the charter school students qualified for free or reduced-price lunches, a key indicator of poverty. That compared with 47 percent of public school students overall. Both sets of figures were close to those in Sanzi’s claim. When Sanzi got back to us, she acknowledged that the state doesn’t track the makeup of those applying to charter schools, but she produced two reports based on more current Department of Education numbers. Her calculations, which used data on school enrollments over the course of the entire 2013-2014 school year, placed the percentage of charter school students that qualified for free  and reduced-price lunches at 72 percent. Her calculations on the ethnic makeup of charter schools were based on October 2014 data. They showed that the ethnic composition of the charter school population had remained basically steady from 2013 to 2014, with Hispanics comprising 54 percent of the student body; blacks 16 percent; whites 25 percent; and other ethnicities 6 percent. She also cited a lottery report from Blackstone Valley Prep Mayoral Academy, the only school to collect information on its applicants. The school found that 69 percent of the applicants qualified for free and reduced-price lunches in 2013-2014 and that the percentage climbed to 72 percent the next school year. Sanzi noted that, according to the state, 78 percent of the charter school students come from just four communities: Central Falls, Pawtucket, Providence and Woonsocket. She then looked to the 2014 Rhode Island Kids Count Factbook. That study found high percentages of low income students in each of those four cities: Central Falls (81 percent); Pawtucket (78 percent); Providence (80 percent); and Woonsocket (75 percent). She also cited  a report out of the Latino Policy Institute at Roger Williams University that shows that three out of four students in those communities are Latino. Our ruling Erika Sanzi said that  ""Of the 10,000 Rhode Island children in charter school lotteries for the fall, more than 70 percent are poor (indicating that their family’s income qualifies them for free or reduced-priced lunch). In addition, a majority of them are students of color."" As we’ve shown, there’s no way for Sanzi -- or anyone else -- to know the precise demographic makeup of the children in Rhode Island’s charter school lotteries. But state records show that about three-quarters of the students who actually are enrolled in charter schools are students of color, and that 78 percent are drawn from just four communities, each with a high percentage of poor and Hispanic children. Those numbers and the other evidence we found suggest that Sanzi’s statement is not only accurate, but perhaps understated. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C41C780>],/factchecks/2015/mar/15/erika-sanzi/writer-says-most-children-ri-charter-school-lotter/

Limbaugh: Ted Kennedy undercut Reagan with back-door line to Soviets
","The balance of power between Congress and the president has been topic No. 1 this week after 47 Republican senators signed a letter designed to undercut a nuclear deal with Iran. That deal has yet to be written, but the senators warned Iran that any agreement could be reversed ""by the stroke of a pen"" by a future president or by an act of Congress. In the war of words that followed, one newspaper tagged the senators as traitors, while conservatives shot back that Democrats have also meddled in foreign policy in the past. A reader asked us about an example making the rounds in conservative media. Fox News host Megyn Kelly, the Newsbusters website, and Rush Limbaugh all have pointed to an episode involving Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy and Republican President Ronald Reagan that purportedly took place in 1983. In Limbaugh’s account, ""Ted Kennedy sent a letter to then Soviet leader Yuri Andropov apologizing for Ronald Reagan and begging the Soviets not to overreact, essentially saying that Reagan was a reckless cowboy and worse, that the Democrats are gonna do their best to rein him in."" In the past, we have reached the Limbaugh show through the company that distributes the program. We did so again and did not hear back. Still, we were able to find much of the story through our own reporting and research, and there’s a lot more uncertainty to the episode -- including if it ever happened at all -- than Limbaugh’s comments suggest. Step back to 1983 In early 1983, Reagan’s plan to place medium-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe generated great concern among voters in the West and within the leadership of the USSR. In this tense period, Viktor Chebrikov, then head of the Soviet spy agency, addressed a memo to Yuri Andropov, the general secretary of the Communist Party and the USSR’s top leader. The memo purports to convey what Kennedy’s ""close friend and trusted confidant J.Tunney"" had to say about Kennedy’s views when visiting Moscow. J. Tunney would be former U.S. Sen. John Tunney, D-Calif.  ""Kennedy believes that, given the current state of affairs, and in the interest of peace, it would be prudent and timely to undertake the following steps to counter the militaristic politics of Reagan and his campaign to psychologically burden the American people,"" the memo said. Those steps included Andropov inviting Kennedy and Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., for a meeting in Moscow. The purpose ""would be to arm Soviet officials with explanations regarding problems of nuclear disarmament so they may be better prepared and more convincing during appearances in the USA."" In addition, Kennedy’s middleman suggested that Andropov come to the United States where he could do interviews on the big three broadcast networks and speak to the ""peaceful intentions of the USSR."" According to the memo, Kennedy’s goal was to ""root out the threat of nuclear war, and to improve Soviet-American relations, so that they define the safety of the world."" As a parting thought in the memo, Tunney said that Kennedy planned to run for president in 1988. Is the memo accurate? First of all, we note that while Limbaugh talked about a letter, there is no evidence that Kennedy ever sent one to Andropov. We asked the Senate Historical Office and the Reagan Library for any record of either a letter or overture made by Kennedy’s office to the Soviet leadership in 1983. Both found nothing. At the end of the day, without any independent documentation, assessing Limbaugh’s claim hinges on whether you believe the memo is telling the truth. The memo gained attention when it was the basis of a news report published in the Times of London in 1992. When the report came out, Tunney told the Times  that it was ""bullshit."" We reached Tunney and he emphatically repeated that. ""The idea that I would be handling contacts with Andropov is preposterous,"" Tunney said. ""This memo is completely false."" At the time, Tunney was no longer a senator but a private businessman; his friendship with Kennedy dated back to law school. He said that while he had made many trips to Moscow over the years and knew people in the KGB, the only political topic Kennedy ever asked him to broach with the Soviets was a deal to release dozens of dissidents. In exchange, Kennedy would make a speech at a university in one of the USSR’s republics in Central Asia. That took place several years earlier. Tunney said that some time after the memo emerged, Kennedy asked him if he knew anything about it and Tunney said ""this is crazy."" In 1992, a Boston Herald reporter reached Kennedy spokesman Paul Donovan. Donovan said Kennedy’s office had made other efforts to meet with Andropov, but nothing ever came of it. According to the Herald, Donovan said ""The rest of the memo is KGB fiction."" Denials from anyone tied to Kennedy might be expected, but Kennedy does have a sort of character reference in the arena of foreign relations from a Reagan insider, the administration’s disarmament negotiator Max Kampelman. In his memoirs Entering New Worlds, Kampelman wrote that the Soviets liked working with Kennedy as a back-door conduit of information, and Kampelman welcomed the arrangement. ""I learned that the senator never acted or received information without informing the appropriate United States agency of official,"" Kampelman wrote. In 1985, Reagan himself approved using Kennedy this way and a working relationship grew between Kampelman and Kennedy. While it is possible that the administration never caught wind of any contacts Tunney had with the KGB, it is worth noting that when the archivists at the Reagan Library searched the White House files on Kennedy, no episode involving the USSR in 1983 popped up. Smoke but no fire? In the Reagan years, Kenneth Adelman served as deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. and then director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. We asked Adelman what he made of the KGB memo, and he dismissed it. He had no idea if an overture might have been made, but even it had, Adelman said it didn’t matter. ""We knew senators were doing this sort of thing all the time and we ignored it,"" Adelman said. ""We didn’t think it was important, and it wasn’t. The administration didn’t care about it."" Stephen Cohen, a political scientist at Princeton University and New York University, suggested that KGB memos shouldn’t be taken at face value. ""As someone who has worked for years in once closed Soviet-era archives, I can tell you that many false documents can be found there,"" Cohen told PunditFact. ""As the saying goes, rubbish in, rubbish out."" Our ruling In the context of a Republican letter to Iran, Limbaugh said that Kennedy sent a similar letter to Andropov in the 1980s that apologized for Reagan and begged the Soviets not to overreact. There is no evidence there ever was a letter from Kennedy. Limbaugh’s statement rests on a 1983 KGB memo that said there was a verbal overture from a friend of Kennedy's to meet with Andropov. Whether the memo was accurate or a KGB invention is deeply contested. We have a firm denial from the man who allegedly made the overture, and a Soviet archive researcher told us that memos of this sort are not always reliable. So Limbaugh was wrong about the letter, and spoke with great certainty about an event when its authenticity is very much in question. Overall, we rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C401F80>],/factchecks/2015/mar/13/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-ted-kennedy-undercut-reagan-back-door-lin/
