No, Biden didn’t say this country is doomed because of African Americans
","Some social media users believe they’ve found a bombshell video clip of President Joe Biden sharing racist rhetoric about African and Hispanic Americans. In the video shared online, Newsmax journalist Grant Stinchfield is seen cutting to a clip from a Dec. 8 private Zoom meeting between Biden, then Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and a group of civil rights leaders.  Biden appears to say, ""This country is doomed. It is doomed, not just because of African Americans, but because by 2040 this country is going to be minority white European. Hear me? Minority white European. And you guys are going to have to start working more with Hispanics, who will make up a larger portion of the population than y’all do."" The problem is that the video is flagrantry clipped to take Biden’s words out of context. The Intercept obtained and released the full Zoom video on Dec. 11. Here’s all of what Biden said: ""My overarching objective — if we cannot make significant progress on racial equity, this country is doomed. It is doomed, not just because of African Americans, but because by 2040 this country is going to be minority white European. Hear me? Minority white European. And you guys are going to have to start working more with Hispanics, who will make up a larger portion of the population than y’all do in terms of raw numbers."" The civil rights leaders on the Zoom meeting included the Rev. Al Sharpton, NAACP President Derrick Johnson, and Vanita Gupta, who was sworn in April 22 as the nation’s associate attorney general.  The group met with newly elected Biden and Harris to discuss prospective executive orders on issues such as voter access, and reversing an order from former President Donald Trump that put restrictions on some workplace diversity trainings and discussions centered on race and sex.  An Instagram post showing a clip of then President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris claims to show Biden saying the country is ""doomed"" because of African Americans and Hispanic Americans, and that white Europeans will decrease in number. The clip takes out of context that Biden said, ""if we cannot make significant progress on racial equity, this country is doomed."" This deceptive editing leaves viewers with the impression that Biden made racist remarks to civil rights leaders. He did not. We rate this post False.

Fact-checking claim about the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19
","An Instagram post claims that the coronavirus pandemic was planned and that ""they gave you the virus on purpose"" to initiate a new world order. The post needs some fact-checking. ""They don’t have to poison you, they can cure you but they choose not to,"" says part of the caption on the April 22 Instagram post. The caption accompanies a nearly 9-minute video featuring Dr. Pierre Kory, a critical care specialist and co-founder of Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, a group of doctors who advocate for the use of the drug ivermectin to treat COVID-19. The Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video in the Instagram post is from Kory’s Dec. 8 testimony before a U.S. Senate committee. He argues that while the National Institutes of Health in August 2020 said ivermectin should not be used outside of control trials, new evidence showed that the drug is effective against the coronavirus. ""We are now in December, this is three to four months later,"" Kory says in the video. ""Mountains of data have emerged from many centers and countries around the world showing the miraculous effectiveness of ivermectin, it basically obliterates transmission of this virus. If you take it, you will not get sick."" About a week after Kory’s testimony, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said that people should not take ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19. A recent study had examined the use of the drug in a laboratory setting, the FDA said, but additional testing was necessary to determine whether it was appropriate to use against COVID-19. The FDA still has not approved ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19. Ivermectin is not a drug used to treat viral infections, and taking large doses of it can be dangerous, the FDA said. The FDA has approved ivermectin tablets to treat people with certain conditions caused by parasitic worms. Topical forms of ivermectin have been approved to treat head lice and certain skin conditions. Separately, some forms of ivermectin are used in animals to prevent heartworm disease and parasites. Ivermectin products for animals are different from the ivermectin products for humans. The FDA says people should not use medication intended for animals. Studies have examined whether ivermectin can be an effective tool in the fight against COVID-19. But, according to federal health and drug agencies, more research is needed. The NIH in February said that some clinical studies showed no benefits or worsening of disease after ivermectin use; other studies suggested using ivermectin had some benefits. ""However, most of these studies had incomplete information and significant methodological limitations, which make it difficult to exclude common causes of bias,"" the NIH said. Overall, the NIH said that insufficient data prevented a federal panel from recommending either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19. ""Results from adequately powered, well-designed, and well-conducted clinical trials are needed to provide more specific, evidence-based guidance on the role of ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19,"" the NIH said. In March, the FDA published a post titled, ""Why you should not use ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19."" It said that ""some initial research is underway,"" but the agency still had not approved ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19 in humans. ""There’s a lot of misinformation around, and you may have heard that it’s okay to take large doses of ivermectin. That is wrong,"" the FDA said. People can overdose on ivermectin, and the drug can also interact with other medications, like blood thinners, according to the FDA. The Infectious Diseases Society of America, representing physicians, scientists and public health experts who specialize in infectious diseases, reviewed several studies regarding ivermectin and COVID-19. According to information last updated in February, the panel recommended against treatment of COVID-19 with ivermectin outside of the context of a clinical trial. One of the concerns raised by the panel was that some trials did not adequately randomize people into treatment and control groups. ""The panel determined the certainty of evidence of treatment of ivermectin for hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients to be very low due to concerns with risk of bias and imprecision,"" the Infectious Diseases Society of America said. An Instagram post featured a video claiming that ""mountains of data"" show that ivermectin ""basically obliterates"" COVID-19 transmission. Some studies suggest that ivermectin can help treat COVID-19; others show no significant impact. Many of the studies had small sample sizes and other limitations. U.S. health and drug agencies say that more research is needed before making a definitive conclusion about ivermectin’s efficacy against COVID-19. The FDA has not approved ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Groups that have analyzed studies about ivermectin and COVID-19 caution about bias and limitations in the trials. Subsequent studies may show positive outcomes from ivermectin. Currently, there are no ""mountains of data"" to show its benefit. The existing evidence is limited and documents mixed results.

Viral TikTok video of Kim Jong Un uses made-up English subtitles
","A viral TikTok video purporting to show North Korea’s Kim Jong Un bashing President Joe Biden as a ""thug,"" a ""coward,"" and ""mentally unstable"" is not what TikTok users are claiming. The video shows a 31-second clip from an October 2020 speech Kim gave during a military parade ceremony celebrating the founding of his political party. But the video’s English subtitles are not an accurate translation of what Kim actually said in his speech.  A screenshot of a TikTok video that uses made-up English subtitles to inaccurately quote North Korea's Kim Jong Un. Here’s what the TikTok video claims Kim said, via its subtitles: ""Joe Biden is a weak president and an insult to North Korea. He is the thug letting protesters burn buildings down. Trump and I still have a good relationship. Biden is a coward. He is more worried about coronavirus and makes America weak. Biden is the real thug. You can't even understand a word he says on TV. He is very mentally unstable."" Here's what the Kim actually said, according to a translation from Newsweek: ""To all the people of this entire country and soldiers of the Korean People's Army on this October anniversary, to the public safety officers and the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and members of the Red Youth Guards, to the delegates of the 75th anniversary celebration ceremony and citizens of Pyongyang, to the military officers and units participating in this military ceremony for this glorious October anniversary ..."" Samuel J. Kim, an assistant professor of Korean translation and interpretation at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, reviewed the TikTok video for PolitiFact and said Newsweek’s translation of the North Korean leader’s remarks is accurate. ""The subtitles are completely fabricated,"" said Kim, the Middlebury professor, of the TikTok video. ""Not one word or idea is consistent with what is being said. In fact, the video is just the opening lines of a speech in which (Kim Jong Un) is simply addressing his audience."" An English translation of the North Korean leader’s full speech provided by the state news agency of North Korea closely resembled Newsweek’s translation, as well.  Neither translation shows Kim talking about Biden or the U.S. during this address. During the final presidential debate before the 2020 election, Biden called Kim, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin ""thugs.""

In voting debate, no evidence that more people of color don't own cars than do
","Eliminating drive-thru voting centers is one of the major features of Senate Bill 7, described by its Republican authors as an election security measure and by its Democratic detractors as an attempt to suppress the vote. The bill would prohibit county election officials from allowing voters to cast ballots from within their vehicles by amending the state’s election code to make voting rules in this regard uniform across the state.  This provision is aimed at Harris County, which set up drive-thru voting centers last year as a safe way to vote during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 127,000 voters cast ballots via the drive-thru centers during the 2020 general election, helping the county set a voter turnout record.   Democratic critics of SB 7 argue that eliminating drive-thru voting would disproportionality affect people of color, since many of the 10 drive-thru voting locations in Harris County were located near concentrations of Blacks and Latinos. Earlier this month, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick pushed back against that argument by saying that most people of color don’t own vehicle.   ""If they're worried about people of color — on the Democrats' side who came up with this drive-in voting — statistics show that more people of color don't have cars than not,"" Patrick said during an April 6 press conference. ""So how do (drive-thru voting centers) help those folks?"" It's unclear what statistics Patrick was referring to. We sought clarification from his office, but his spokesperson did not respond to several messages. So we searched for sources that show rates of car ownership among different races and ethnicities.   The nearly 10 automotive and consumer analytic firms we reached out to — including IHS Markit, Cox Automotive, Experian, and J.D. Power — either don't collect racial data on car ownership rates or declined to share their research citing proprietary reasons.   So we turned to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey that collects social, economic and demographic data from 3.5 million households every year. The Census Bureau uses the survey data to create estimates on a broad range of population and economic characteristics at state and local levels, including rates of car ownership among racial and ethnic groups. Among the state’s 3.4 million African Americans, 88% own at least one vehicle, according to the 2019 American Community Survey, an aggregation of five years of data, the most recent available. Of the state’s Asian population of 1.3 million, 95% own at least 1 vehicle. And of the state’s 11.1 million people who identify as of Latino or Hispanic origin, 95% own at least one vehicle. Vehicle ownerships rates are similarly high for the state’s white, native, mixed race and other racial groups. The National Equity Atlas, a policy data firm that describes itself as ""America's most detailed report card on racial and economic equity,"" also publishes a vehicle ownership analysis based on American Community Survey data from 2017. Its findings are largely the same: 93% of non-white households in Texas own a car compared to 96% of white households. Vehicle ownership in Texas also is higher among all racial and ethnic groups than the national rate. Nine percent of households nationally are without a vehicle, the Atlas shows. In Texas, 12% of black households don’t own cars compared to 19% nationwide. And 6% of Latino households are car-less in Texas compared to 11% nationwide.  Vehicle ownership rates for Harris County alone are similar. About 89% of the county’s Black population owns at least one vehicle. And between 95% and 96% of the county’s other racial groups own at least one vehicle, according to the Census Bureau data.   Houston, a sprawling metropolitan area that is located primarily within Harris County, is one of the most car-dependent cities in the U.S. According to the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, Houston ranks near the top of vehicle miles traveled per capita among the largest U.S. cities.   Harris County became the first jurisdiction in Texas to open drive-thru voting centers at a scale ""that allows any registered voter to cast their ballot without leaving the comfort of their vehicle,"" the county’s election administrator’s website says.   Ten drive-thru voting sites were open during the early voting period and one, the Toyota Center in downtown Houston, was open on Election Day.  An analysis of the county’s early voting rosters conducted by the Texas Civil Rights Project shows that people of color used the drive-thru voting sites at higher rates than whites. About 53% of the votes cast at the 10 drive-thru sites were by Hispanic, Black or Asian voters during the early voting period. Meanwhile, 38% of all early votes cast during the election were by people in those three demographic groups. African American voters especially used drive-thru voting sites at higher rates. Fourteen percent of all early votes were cast by Black voters countywide, while 22% of all ballots cast at the drive-thru centers were by Blacks, according to the data.   Asian voters similarly took advantage of the drive-thru option. While 4% of the early votes in Harris County were cast by Asians, they accounted for 8% of the votes cast at the drive-thru centers. ""(Patrick’s) comment just doesn't make any sense to me as an actual counterpoint,"" said James Slattery, senior staff attorney of the Voting Rights Program at the Texas Civil Rights Project.  ""Even if people of color did own cars at disproportionately lower rates, and yet still used drive-thru voting at a higher rate than their share of the population, then doesn't that actually bolster the case that this particular form of voting was vital to them in particular?"" Slattery said. In justifying a provision of SB 7 that would eliminate drive-thru voting, Patrick said that ""statistics show that more people of color don’t have cars than not. So how do (drive-thru voting centers) help those folks?""  Estimates from the Census Bureau show that there is no racial or ethnic group, either in Texas or in Harris County specifically, in which more people don’t own cars than do. Blacks lag other groups in car ownership in Texas, but all groups in Texas own cars at higher rates than the national averages. Statewide and in Harris County, rates of car ownership among whites, Blacks, Hispanic or Latino, Native, mixed or other groups range from 88-96%.  An analysis of the Harris County voting rosters also shows people of color used drive-thru voting sites at higher rates than white voters.   We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/apr/23/dan-patrick/voting-debate-no-evidence-more-people-color-dont-o/

Did California Congresswoman Maxine Waters Tamper With The Jury In Derek Chauvin’s Trial?
","An image published on Facebook by The Western Journal’s Conservative Tribune claimed that U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California, could be ""sentenced"" for ""jury tampering,"" referring to comments the Congress member made several days before former police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd.

 The image features a photo of labor union leader Jimmy Hoffa, who was convicted of jury tampering in 1964, next to a photo of Waters. Text underneath Waters’ photo reads, ""Maxine Waters, 2021: Sentenced to ___ for jury tampering?"" We decided to examine the details in this fact check. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook.) It had been shared more than 4,800 times as of April 23. Waters’ remarks before the verdict On April 17, Waters spoke to protesters in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, where Daunte Wright, a Black man, was recently shot and killed by Kim Potter, a white police officer. Waters spoke for approximately 10 minutes and told protesters that she came to stand with them. She publicly called on Congress to pass police reform. She then took questions from the crowd. One person asked, ""What needs to happen that is different this year than all the years before?"" Waters responded that she was ""looking for the guilty verdict"" and encouraged protesters to stay in the streets and ""fight for justice."" The questioner followed up by asking Waters if she was looking for a guilty verdict just for Chauvin’s manslaughter charge, and she said ""Oh, no, not manslaughter. … This is guilty for murder."" The questioner then asked Waters, ""What should protesters do,"" assuming Chavin was not convicted. The Congress member told protesters they must ""stay on the street"" and ""get more confrontational"" so that ""they know that we mean business."" Republicans subsequently rebuked Waters for her remarks, accusing her of inciting violence. She defended herself in an interview with The Grio, saying that she is nonviolent and that her comments were taken out of context. ""I talk about confronting the justice system, confronting the policing that’s going on, I’m talking about speaking up,"" Waters said. ""I’m talking about legislation. I’m talking about elected officials doing what needs to be done to control their budgets and to pass legislation."" On Tuesday, Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives defeated a Republican effort to censure Waters for her comments. Do Waters’ comments constitute jury tampering? Jury tampering is a criminal offense in the United States and refers to communicating with a juror, through private messages or indirectly, with the intent of influencing deliberations. Jurors in Chauvin’s trial were all selected in March from Hennepin County, where Floyd died and where the case is being tried. Chauvin’s defense team initially petitioned to change the location of the trial, but their request was denied. To avoid tampering, jurors’ identities were not made public, although the court did release demographic information, including their gender, race and approximate age. Before selection, all potential jurors were required to fill out a 16-page questionnaire, which asked them a variety of questions surrounding their views on racial discimination and policing. Jurors responded to questions about how many times they saw video of Floyd's death, if they participated in recent demonstrations on police brutality, whether they previously advocated for or against police reform and their views on defunding the police. Defense attorney Eric Nelson and prosecutor Steve Schleicher questioned the prospective jurors during the selection process, and were able to ask the court to dismiss prospective jurors for cause if they felt the person could not be impartial in the trial. They were also able to use a peremptory challenge to dismiss jurors without cause. The defense team was granted 18 peremptory challenges and used 14 to dismiss jurors, while the prosecution was allowed 10 and used eight. After the shooting of Wright, days before Waters spoke with protesters in Brooklyn Center, Chauvin’s defense team requested that the jury be sequestered until the end of the trial. Judge Peter Cahill rejected the request, noting that the jury would be sequestered during deliberations and that jurors had been repeatedly instructed not to talk to anyone about the case and to avoid watching the news.  Earlier in the trial, Cahill brought a juror in for questioning about potential outside contact. The juror said she had received a text message from her mother that read, ""looks like it was a bad day,"" according to MPR News. The juror said she hadn’t talked to anyone about the case and she was allowed to go back to the jury. Following Waters’ comments, Nelson moved for a mistrial. He said there was ""a high probability"" that jurors were aware of Waters’ remarks, which he characterized as ""threatening and intimidating."" ""The idea is that it is a public trial; I think the court has accomplished that, but the media attention is so profound … and it is so pervasive that I just don’t know how this jury can really be said to be that they are free from the taint of this,"" Nelson said. ""And now that we have U.S. representatives threatening acts of violence in relation to this specific case, it’s mind-boggling to me."" Cahill denied the motion, telling Chauvin’s defense team that he trusted the jury was following his instructions to avoid the news. ""I don’t think it has prejudiced us with additional material that would prejudice his jury,"" Cahill said. ""A congresswoman’s opinion really doesn’t matter a whole lot."" However, he also said he wished ""elected officials would stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that is disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch,"" and admitted that Waters’ remarks might be grounds for appeal in the future. ""I'll give you that Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned,"" Cahill told Nelson. Legal experts said they expect Chauvin’s defense team to cite Waters’ comments in an appeal, but UC Berkeley law professor Jonathan Simon said that he is ""skeptical"" that the verdict will be overturned on the grounds that the remarks prejudiced the jury. Simon noted that similar issues surrounding media exposure ""come up in almost every crime of great notoriety,"" but trial decisions are rarely overturned. ""The concern that the jury was influenced by politicians saying there could be trouble — they hardly needed politicians to draw that conclusion,"" Simon said in an interview released by UC Berkeley’s Office of Communications and Public Affairs. ""That was obvious after George Floyd was murdered, when there were demonstrations that at least sometimes became violent or destructive."" Similarly, Ted Sampsell-Jones — a former appellate criminal defense attorney and a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota — said in an interview with PolitiFact that Waters’ comments were ""unfortunate,"" but unlikely to reverse Chauvin’s conviction as Cahill ""took reasonable measures"" to avoid undue influence on the jury. ""A defendant is entitled to a fair trial, not a perfect trial,"" Sampsell-Jones said. ""Finally, given the overwhelming evidence of guilt, appellate courts will conclude that adverse publicity didn’t affect the result. Even if Rep. Waters hadn’t made those statements, he’d still have been found guilty."" Our ruling A misleading image published on Facebook by The Western Journal’s Conservative Tribune accused Democratic U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters from California of jury tampering because of her comments to protesters on Chauvin’s trial. It positioned it’s claim in the form of a question: ""Maxine Waters, 2021: Sentenced to ___ for jury tampering?"" The claim leaves out crucial facts about the jury selection process and what happened in court. Judge Peter Cahill criticized Waters but also refused a mistrial motion from the defense team, who claimed that Waters’ comments prejudiced the jury. He said he believes the jury remained capable of conducting their duties.  Legal experts concur, noting that even if some jurors heard Waters’ comments, they were unlikely to be swayed by them given the prior knowledge of the case that they had coming into the courtroom. Furthermore, while jurors were not sequestered until deliberations, numerous steps were taken during jury selection and the course of the trial to ensure the jury was impartial and avoided any news concerning the case, even in the face of immense media attention.  Chauvin is almost certain to file an appeal, which Waters’ remarks could impact. However, legal experts believe it’s unlikely that the results of the trial would be overturned. And, although the image poses the idea of Waters being ""sentenced"" for her actions as a question, not a declaration, it’s important to note that she most likely would not be charged for her actions last week. We rate this statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",/factchecks/2021/apr/23/facebook-posts/did-california-congresswoman-maxine-waters-tamper-/

COVID-19 far less dangerous to kids, but wrong to say they ‘are not affected’
","In a viral video clip, a suburban Atlanta mother who implored her local school board to stop mandating masks for children claimed that kids ages 5 to 9 ""are not affected by"" the coronavirus. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Children have been less likely than adults to contract COVID-19, and it’s rare for them to become seriously ill with the virus — but to say they are not affected goes too far. More than 3.6 million children in the United States have tested positive, and at least 297 have died, according to the latest report from American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association. One reason schools require masks is to try to prevent kids from giving the virus to other people, which can happen even if kids become infected but don’t show symptoms. Moreover, because adults are being immunized and new variants of the virus are more likely to infect children, ""children are rapidly becoming the major reservoir of COVID in the United States,"" said Dr. Mark Schleiss, professor of pediatrics at the University of Minnesota Medical School.  The two-minute video clip was widely shared by Facebook users, including conservative commentator and Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren, who has 4.8 million Facebook followers. She wrote: ""This badass stuck her neck out and said what so many are thinking but are afraid to say! You go girl!!! BURN THE MASKS!"" The clip shows Courtney Taylor on April 15 speaking to the Board of Education in Gwinnett County, outside of Atlanta. ""Every month I come here and I hear the same thing: social-emotional health. If you truly mean that, you would end the mask requirement tonight. Tonight,"" said Taylor, who identified herself as the mother of a 6-year-old student. ""This is not March 2020 anymore. We have three vaccines. Every adult in the state of Georgia that wants that vaccine is eligible to get it right now and everyone one of us knows that young children are not affected by this virus. They’re not. … ""We chose you to make decisions that would be in our children’s best interest, and forcing 5-, 6-, 7-, 8- and 9-year-old little children to cover their noses and their mouths, where they breathe, for seven hours a day every day for the last nine months for a virus that you know doesn’t affect them — that is not in their best interest. And this has to stop.""  The district requires masks for students, staff and visitors. Students can remove masks during meals; they can also remove them outside when ""social distancing can be achieved."" ""Masks/cloth face coverings are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have symptoms yet,"" the district says. Fewer than 10% of COVID-19 cases in the United States have been among children and adolescents age 5 to 17, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Kansas, one of the few states that provides data by age groups for children, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, 4% of the COVID-19 cases — 12,325 — occurred among children 9 and under.  ""At this time, it still appears that severe illness due to COVID-19 is rare among children. However, there is an urgent need to collect more data on longer-term impacts of the pandemic on children, including ways the virus may harm the long-term physical health of infected children, as well as its emotional and mental health effects,"" the report said. Most children who become infected have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, but some can get severely ill, according to the CDC and other researchers. And while COVID-19 presents less risk to children and teens generally — and children under 10 appear less likely than adolescents to become infected — children can get sick and can spread the virus, even without symptoms, according to the CDC. The CDC is also investigating ""a rare but serious medical condition"" associated with COVID-19 in children called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, a condition where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. in Children. ""We do not yet know what causes MIS-C and who is at increased risk for developing it,"" the CDC says. Why children react differently to the coronavirus isn’t yet clear, according to the Mayo Clinic. Evidence indicates that ""in-person learning in schools has not been associated with substantial"" transmission of COVID-19 in the community, and that staff-to-staff transmission is more common than transmission from students to staff, staff to student, or student to student, according to the CDC. The CDC says multiple studies have shown that transmission within school settings is typically lower than, or at least similar to, levels of community transmission — ""when prevention strategies are in place in schools."" As we’ve reported, masks are most effective as ""source control,"" which means preventing infected people from spreading the virus to other people.  Respiratory droplets carrying the virus are expelled into the air when infected people cough, talk, sneeze or breathe. These droplets quickly evaporate and shrink to become tiny airborne particles.  But if an infected person is wearing a mask, it will catch and contain the larger droplets in the humid space between the person’s mouth and the mask. In this environment, droplets take nearly a hundred times as long to transform into airborne particles. So, masks reduce the spread of infectious particles. This makes a meaningful difference when everyone is wearing masks. If you’re the only one wearing a mask in a public location, it won’t necessarily protect you from being infected. But if everybody is wearing a mask, your odds of infection will go down by quite a bit.  Public health experts have based their guidance on a variety of scientific studies: systematic reviews, ecological studies and laboratory studies.  A woman in a video clip widely shared on Facebook stated that children ages 5 to 9 ""are not affected by"" the coronavirus. Most children who get COVID-19 have mild or no symptoms; severe illness is rare. But more than 3.6 million children have tested positive and at least 297 have died. And children can spread the virus to others, even if they don’t have symptoms, which is a key reason for mask requirements in schools. We rate the statement Half True.

Body camera footage shows Ma’Khia Bryant holding knife when shooting occurred
","Conflicting narratives continue to circulate about the confrontation outside a Columbus, Ohio, foster home that led to the deadly shooting of 16-year-old Ma’Khia Bryant. Some claim Bryant was attacking another person when she was shot; others say she was acting in self-defense. ""Please DO NOT ignore this!!!"" one viral Facebook post starts off saying. ""As the George Floyd verdict was being announced, Columbus Ohio Police killed 15 year old Makhia Bryant. She called the police as she was about to get jumped. She had a knife in her hand for self defense, but when officers arrived it was on the ground away from her. The officer immediately opened fired shooting her 4x’s."" Some early reports indicated Bryant was 15 years old, but later corrected her age as 16. There has been no confirmation of whether it was Bryant who first called the police for help, and we don’t know the details of what happened before the police arrived.  But body camera footage from a responding officer shows that a knife was in Bryant’s hand, not on the ground, when the officer first fired his gun.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Police received a 911 call around 4:32 p.m. about a disturbance on the southeastern side of the city. A female caller reported that a group of women were trying to fight with her and stab her and others. Then she hung up. Officers from the Columbus police arrived about 13 minutes later and reported that an officer was involved in a shooting. Police later identified the officer as Nicholas Reardon, who joined the department in December 2019. Reardon’s body camera footage, released by the police, shows the officer approaching a chaotic scene in front of a house. As he walks up, the video shows a female being pushed to the ground and Reardon pointing his weapon in the direction of the struggle while a man runs up and appears to kick the female on the ground.  Soon after, Bryant is seen running toward another female next to a car parked in the driveway, while waving a knife. Reardon can be heard yelling ""get down"" a couple of times before he starts shooting.  Other than the body camera video, police haven’t shared many more details about the shooting, citing a pending investigation by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation. The knife can be seen on the ground after the shooting. It’s not clear from the video when Bryant dropped it.   Reardon shot Bryant four times. In a news conference, interim Police Chief Michael Woods was asked whether officers are trained to use their service weapons over a stun gun in such a situation. ""When officers are faced with someone employing deadly force, deadly force can be the response the officer gives,"" Woods said, in an apparent reference to the knife that was seen in Bryant’s hand. The contradicting accounts may have originated from interviews given by Bryant’s family before the footage was released. Bryant’s aunt, Hazel Bryant, told the Columbus Dispatch that her niece dropped the knife before police fired, and other family members and neighbors told local news outlets that it was Bryant who called the police and was acting in self-defense. Meanwhile, activists in Columbus are calling for a federal probe of the shooting and the city’s mayor, Democrat Andrew Ginther, told reporters that the investigation ""will determine if the officer involved was wrong and, if he was, we will hold him accountable."" A Facebook post claims that the knife was on the ground when police arrived at the scene of the deadly shooting of Ma’Khia Bryant. We aren’t judging the officer’s actions, but body camera footage shows that the claim about the knife is inaccurate. A knife can be seen in Bryant’s hand when the officer began to fire his gun.

Wisconsin schools leader on the mark with claim that masks are factor in mitigating COVID spread
","More than a year into the coronavirus pandemic, debate remains around a central means of combating the spread of COVID-19: To wear or not to wear a mask. At least the debate still exists among the general public and some politicians. Science and public health experts have pretty much all come down on one side: Mask up. That’s where newly-elected Superintendent of Public Instruction Jill Underly fell when asked for her opinion on school mask requirements during an interview April 11, 2021 on WISN’s ""UpFront.""  ""As far as mitigating spread, they say that masks is the number one way to do so,"" Underly said. ""And I feel that is, that's what we need to do to keep our buildings open. I think we should be wearing masks. But again, that's my recommendation, I believe in the science. But I do feel that each school district is going to have to make that decision for themselves.""  Underly made the comment at a point when thousands of students in Milwaukee Public Schools and the Madison Metropolitan School District were returning to the classroom, at least on a hybrid basis, for the first time since the pandemic began. Most other other districts in the state had been operating in person for months, some from the start of the school year last fall. Still, there has been pushback against the decisions, including by the Milwaukee Teachers’ Education Association, the teacher’s union, which has questioned the safety of returning to in-person learning. Let’s focus on Underly’s claim about mask’s being the best way to mitigate COVID-19 spread. In February, we rated True a claim by Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz, D-Oshkosh, that ""we know mask mandates work. There’s enough evidence out there between counties that have done it and counties that haven’t."" Nothing has changed since then in terms of the science behind the effectiveness of masks. But what about Underly’s claim that masks rank at the top of the mitigation list? When asked for backup for the claim, Erin Forrest of Underly’s transition team emailed a list of articles and studies related to the science behind masks, including a University of California San Francisco June 26, 2020 paper ""Still Confused About Masks? Here’s the Science Behind How Face Masks Prevent Coronavirus"" and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ""Face Masks, Including Surgical Masks, and Respirators for COVID-19."" ""It’s also important to note that right now there is no vaccine approved for people under 16 years of age,"" Forrest said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.    But she did not cite any study that ranked the various methods for mitigating spread of the coronavirus. We could not find any either in our search.  That said, experts agree that mask wearing is a primary way to do so, albeit in conjunction with other steps, such as hand-washing, social-distancing and -- now that vaccines are available -- getting a shot. Ajay Sethi, an epidemiologist and professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us wearing a properly fitted mask is ""imperative.""  ""Both masks and physical distancing are needed to interrupt transmission of the coronavirus in indoor environments,"" Sethi said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""When food or drink is being served for consumption, then maintaining proper physical distance is imperative. When maintaining physical distance is challenging, then wearing a high quality, properly fit mask is imperative. Ideally, both wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing are being done together."" City of Milwaukee Health Commissioner Kirsten Johnson told us: ""Masking is at the top of the list for the Milwaukee Health Department. Combined with vaccination, that is the best way to stop COVID.""  That point is echoed in numerous other places. Harvard Medical School puts mask wearing at the top of its list of steps individuals can take. Yale Medicine includes it on its list, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance April 6, 2021on improving the fit and filtration of masks that included this note: ""Correct and consistent mask use is a critical step everyone can take to reduce their risk of getting and spreading COVID-19."" Finally, the World Health Organization, in a Q&A posted on its website, notes that ""masks are a key measure to suppress transmission and save lives."" The website goes on to say: ""Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive ‘Do it all!’ approach including physical distancing, avoiding crowded, closed and close-contact settings, good ventilation, cleaning hands, covering sneezes and coughs, and more."" Underly said for mitigating COVID-19 spread, ""masks (are) the number one way to do so.""  Experts at the local, national (CDC) and international (WHO) level, all say that masks are vital to lowering the risk of spreading COVID-19. That said, they also note simply wearing a mask is not enough and that other mitigation strategies, such as vaccination, social distancing and hand washing are also important.  And, for the most part, students cannot be vaccinated. The vaccines are only available to those 16 and older. We rate Underly’s claim Mostly True. PolitiFact: No, WHO didn’t just say you don’t need to wear a mask  PolitiFact: Mask skeptics ask questions.

No, Derek Chauvin’s lawyer didn’t say space aliens invaded his body
","The trial of Derek Chauvin ended with guilty charges for the killing of George Floyd, but there’s some confusion as to what Chauvin’s defense attorney, Eric Nelson, was trying to prove in a comment he made during his closing argument. The sentence was captured in a now-viral TikTok video: ""Space aliens flew in, inhabited the body of Derek Chauvin, and caused this death.""  Additional text on the video reads, ""If I ever go to jail make this guy my lawyer."" The video got 1.2 million views, and a lot of comments from people who were confused by Nelson’s statement. Context is definitely needed. We took a look at the complete transcript of Nelson’s closing argument. Here’s the surrounding sentences of what he said: ""Essentially, what the state has to convince you is that the evidence in this case completely eliminates any reasonable doubt. Or in other words, leaving only unreasonable doubt. Capricious, fanciful, capricious doubt. Capricious means unpredictable. Fanciful, space aliens flew in, inhabited the body of Derek Chauvin and caused this death. That’s fanciful. Beyond the reasonable doubt, it is the highest standard in the law. It doesn’t mean beyond all possibility of doubt, because I suppose space aliens may have been inhabiting his body, but that’s obviously fanciful and capricious."" Ric Simmons, professor of law at the Moritz College of Law at The Ohio State University, broke it down for us — Nelson was not using space aliens as an argument for the defense, but rather as an analogy of what an unreasonable doubt would be.  ""Lawyers in criminal cases do this all the time. Nelson was trying to distinguish reasonable doubt from other kinds of doubt,"" Simmons said. ""As he said, ‘capricious and fanciful doubt’ includes every kind of uncertainty, including the absurd and highly improbable scenarios like space aliens."" Simmons said that Nelson had tried to prove the points made in his defense were reasonable, which were that Floyd died because of drugs, an enlarged heart, or carbon monoxide from the squad car exhaust. Steve Schleicher, one of the attorneys for the prosecution, used his closing argument to say that there had been no medical evidence of any of the above, and that Floyd died because of the excessive force that Chauvin and the other officers used when they put him into the ""prone"" position. ""It's a position you use to secure someone in handcuffs,"" Schleicher explained. ""And then when you're done with that, you immediately roll them on their side, right? That's the position he was in. Proning him was completely unnecessary, and this is where the excessive force begins, right?"" Schleicher later added, ""Believe your eyes. What you saw, you saw."" Following the closing arguments, the jury deliberated for 10 hours, and came back to the courtroom with convictions on all three charges against Chauvin of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. His sentencing is expected in two months.  A TikTok video went viral, claiming that Chauvin’s defense attorney said that space aliens inhabited Chauvin’s body and caused Floyd’s death. Nelson wasn’t using that as part of his defense, but as an example of a capricious or fanciful doubt. Nelson was arguing that the points made in his defense were not capricious or fanciful.  The jury did not agree with his points and convicted Chauvin on all counts of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Still, he wasn’t actually suggesting space aliens were to blame. We rate this post False.",/factchecks/2021/apr/22/tiktok-posts/no-derek-chauvins-lawyer-didnt-say-space-aliens-in/

Photos reveal Greta Thunberg is a trained actress who comes from a long line of actors.
","It wouldn’t be Earth Day without coming across social media posts that criticize climate change activist Greta Thunberg. ""Greta has been an actress most of her life,"" a post on Instagram claims. ""She is from a long line of actors and has spent most of her childhood preparing for roles."" The post features a collage of images, with the central one showing a young girl — who is supposedly Thunberg — speaking into a microphone with an Islamic State member beside her and an ISIS flag in the background. The same girl is pictured again, this time crying with the man’s arm around her and text overlaid that says: ""look up the 7yo marriage hoax."" The last image in the collage appears to show Thunberg’s IMDb filmography page. A few things: The young girl seen in the images with ISIS is not Thunberg. And while there are actors in Thunberg’s family, that is not evidence that she is as well. Thunberg’s filmography page lists the influential activist’s appearances in climate change documentaries and news segments.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photos showing the young girl with an ISIS member is not Thunberg, as we’ve noted in a previous fact-check.  A reverse image search revealed that the photos were taken from a video of a 2013 Quran recitation competition organized by the Islamic State in Aleppo, Syria. A 2014 report by The Morocco World News explained that the girl was 7 years old at the time and began to cry during the event after she made mistakes during her recitation. While the child looks similar to Thunberg — who would have been 10 at the time — it’s not her.

Rick Perry says only four Texas lawmakers opposed in-state tuition law for illegal immigrants
","
Under fire recently for his stance on giving in-state college tuition rates to illegal immigrants in Texas, Gov. Rick Perry stated that in 2001, only four Texas legislators voted against the measure. 
The statement came as Perry apologized in a Sept. 28, 2011, interview with Newsmax TV for saying anyone who opposed giving tuition breaks to the children of illegal immigrants did not ""have a heart"" — a comment he made in the Sept. 22, 2011, Republican presidential debate. 
In an article about the interview, though, Newsmax noted that Perry stood by his view that the decision in his state to extend tuition breaks was the right one. ""I was probably a bit over-passionate by using that word, and it was inappropriate,"" Perry was quoted as saying. ""In Texas, in 2001, we had 181 members of the Legislature — only four voted against this piece of legislation — because it wasn't about immigration, it was about education."" 
Only four of the 181 members voted no? 
We’ve written other items about this law in recent days, so our interest was piqued. (We checked statements about whether Perry gave illegal immigrants in-state rates and the difference in dollars between in-state and out-of-state tuition.) 
According to the journals for the 2001 session kept by the Texas House and Senate, Perry is darned close. 
Versions of the proposal cleared House and Senate education panels with no opposition. The House passed the measure 142-1, with Rep. Will Hartnett, R-Dallas, being the lone ""no"" vote; five House members were absent, according to the April 23, 2001, House Journal entry. 
After amending the bill, the Senate approved it 27-3 on May 21, 2001, with Republicans Mike Jackson of La Porte, Jane Nelson of Flower Mound and Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio in opposition. 
Three days later, the House approved the Senate's changes 130-2; the ""no"" voters were Hartnett and Rep. Jerry Madden, R-Richardson. Sixteen members were not present. 
Perry signed the measure into law June 16, 2001. 
Our count: Five of the 181 legislators referred to by Perry (31 state senators, 150 House members) voted against the tuition legislation. That's close enough for us to rate his claim True.",/factchecks/2011/sep/28/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-only-four-texas-lawmakers-opposed-/

Barack Obama slams Rick Perry on climate change, citing Texas wildfires
","During a Sept. 26, 2011, speech at a Democratic National Committee fundraising event in San Jose, Calif., President Barack Obama aimed some attack lines at the Republican Party.

""Some of you here may be folks who actually used to be Republican but are puzzled by what’s happened to that party...."" Obama said in comments that, according to the White House’s transcript, were punctuated by laughter. ""I mean, has anybody been watching the debates lately? You’ve got a governor whose state is on fire denying climate change. No, no, it’s true. You’ve got audiences cheering at the prospect of somebody dying because they don’t have health care, and booing a service member in Iraq because they’re gay. That’s not reflective of who we are. We’ve had differences in the past, but at some level we’ve always believed, you know what, that we’re not defined by our differences. We’re bound together.""

After several readers brought it to our attention, we zeroed in on Obama’s comment that ""you’ve got a governor whose state is on fire denying climate change.""

The governor in question is Rick Perry of Texas -- one of the leading candidates in the Republican presidential primary and therefore a potential challenger to Obama in his bid for a second term next year.

As for the fires Obama mentioned, Texas has been experiencing one of its most severe wildfire seasons in history.  According to the Texas Forest Service, 3.8 million acres burned and 2,742 homes were destroyed by wildfires between Nov. 15, 2010 and Sept. 26, 2011.

A spokesman for Perry, Mark Miner, thought Obama’s comment was unfair, telling ABC News, ""It’s outrageous President Obama would use … the worst fires in state history as a political attack.""

Asked about Obama’s comments during a Sept. 26 press availability, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters on Air Force One that the president’s ""point was simply that you have severe weather in that state, and the leader of that state questioned whether something that's been well established as a scientific fact is in fact a fact. … (Obama’s) point is that the link between climate and the severe weather that we’ve been experiencing is something that's studied by scientists all the time, and to simply dismiss it is, he believes, not responsible leadership.""

Despite our readers’ urgings, we gave serious thought to not rating Obama’s comment on the Truth-O-Meter. Obama clearly intended it to be a lighthearted comment, and the audience took it that way, as evidenced by applause noted in the transcript. In addition, the line was a rhetorical aside, not part of a substantive policy address about climate change.

But Obama’s comment fit our main qualification for choosing items to fact-check -- would people wonder whether the comment is true? Is it possible to draw a link between a specific weather event, such as the drought in Texas and the wildfires, and global climate change?

As it turns out, this question has an interesting answer.

First, some background on climate change.

Perry is on record expressing skepticism that human actions are causing climate change. During a Republican debate on Sept. 7, 2011, he said that ""the science is not settled (on climate change). The idea that we would put Americans’ economy at jeopardy based on scientific theory that’s not settled yet to me is just nonsense."" We also fact-checked a separate comment by Perry ""questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change. … (It is) more and more being put into question.""

We ruled Perry’s statements False. As we noted, one of the most oft-cited reports on climate change comes from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is widely considered the leading international organization on climate science. It includes the scientific consensus of thousands of researchers from 194 countries. ""Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in (human-created) greenhouse gas concentrations,"" the most recent report states.
   
In the United States, the U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates and integrates federal research on climate. Its 2009 report mirrored the IPCC's conclusions, and the report directly addressed the question of how climate change could affect weather.

""Water is an issue in every region, but the nature of the potential impacts varies,"" it said in a summary. ""Drought, related to reduced precipitation, increased evaporation and increased water loss from plants, is an important issue in many regions, especially in the West. Floods and water quality problems are likely to be amplified by climate change in most regions. Declines in mountain snowpack are important in the West and Alaska where snowpack provides vital natural water storage.""

However, climate-change experts have also long urged caution in assuming that particular weather events are caused or influenced by climate change.

Consider a June 2011 paper published by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, an independent research organization. In the paper -- titled ""Extreme Weather and Climate Change Understanding the Link, Managing the Risk"" -- co-authors Daniel G. Huber and Jay Gulledge write that ""when we ask whether climate change ‘caused’ a particular event, we pose a fundamentally unanswerable question."" In fact, they say it is ""nonsense"" to debate a direct climatological link between a single event and the long-term rise in the global average surface temperature.

The reason, Huber and Gulledge write, is the distinction between ""climate"" -- a long-term pattern that averages many weather events over the years -- and a particular weather event.

By definition, Huber and Gulledge write, ""an isolated event lacks useful information about climate trends. Consider a hypothetical example: Prior to any change in the climate, there was one category 5 hurricane per year, but after the climate warmed for some decades, there were two category 5 hurricanes per year. In a given year, which of the two hurricanes was caused by climate change? Since the two events are indistinguishable, this question is nonsense. It is not the occurrence of either of the two events that matters. The two events together – or more accurately, the average of two events per year – define the change in the climate.""

What makes the Texas situation an imperfect fit for this general rule is that what’s happening isn’t one wildfire, or even a spate of wildfires. It’s a months-long season of specific weather-related events -- wildfires -- whose roots stem from broader climatic conditions.

""It is a combination of unprecedented heat this summer, completely obliterating the previous record; exceptional drought conditions; exceptional soil moisture decreases, which exacerbate the temperature extremes; and, on top of that, extensive wild fires,"" said Gavin Schmidt, a climate specialist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. ""These elements cannot be separated. … Extreme heat becomes more common under climate change, and that has consequences, depending on location -- more drought, and more susceptibility to wildfires.""

Even Gulledge, the co-author of the Pew paper that cautioned against blaming weather events on climate change, said the Texas case may constitute an exception to the rule he laid out.

""There is a well-documented link between the earlier start of spring, higher summer temperatures, and drier conditions during summer and fall -- that is, climate change -- and a dramatic increase in wildfire activity in the western U.S. since the late 1980s,"" he said. ""These observations reveal an increase in fire risk due to climate change.""

Gulledge found it noteworthy that in a recent blog post, John Nielsen-Gammon -- the Texas state climatologist and a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University -- suggested a connection between the wildfires and climate change, even if it came with caveats and limitations.

On the one hand, Nielsen-Gammon said the low rainfall levels since October 2010 do not appear to have been made ""more likely"" by global warming. In turn, this rainfall deficit, he estimated, explains most of the excess heat that set the stage for the wildfires. On the other hand, his modeling suggested that global warming did provide an additional contributing factor to the unusually high temperatures. ""The impacts of the drought,"" he concluded, ""were enhanced by global warming.""

What makes this topic so difficult to analyze is that the way the atmosphere works is extremely complicated. Gulledge compared the atmosphere to a car.

""Both the atmosphere and a car are complex systems, but one is fundamentally predictable, while the other is fundamentally unpredictable,"" he said. ""A given force applied to the atmosphere has many different potential outcomes, not a single calculable outcome. That’s different from an automobile, which can be predicted very precisely. If I step on the gas, it will speed up; if I turn the wheel, the car will turn. Consequently, weather forecasters give percentage chances of rain instead of performing a single calculation that predicts a single amount of rain in a given place on a given day.""

A related complication is that this boils down to a question of probabilities rather than certainties.

""The right question to ask is, ‘Has global warming increased the likelihood of an event like the Texas drought occurring’ And the answer to that question is yes,"" said Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami. ""While droughts occur in a climate unaffected by human activities, a warming climate increases the likelihood that they will occur.""

He offers an analogy that he credits to a colleague, Tony Broccoli of Rutgers University. ""Consider a baseball player who goes through a rigorous off-season training program, which results in greater strength and faster bat speed,"" Soden said. ""On his first at bat of the season, he hits a home run. Would you say that the home run was a result of his off season training? No one can answer that question. But would you say that the off-season training increased the likelihood of it occurring? Yes.""

Rob Jackson, the director of the Duke Center on Global Change, acknowledges this backdrop of uncertainty. ""Can anyone say with certainty that this is climate-change related? Absolutely not,"" he said. But Jackson -- who went to college and taught in Texas and continues to visit frequently to see family -- suggested that the scale of the Texas wildfires is starting to change the minds of some scientists who have traditionally been hesitant to blame specific weather events on climate change.

""The heat and drought I saw in August is almost enough to make me say that climate change is playing a role, amplifying other factors,"" Jackson said. ""I've never said that before about any weather event.""

Our ruling

Historically, scientists have drawn a clear distinction between specific weather events and longer-range changes in climate, and that sentiment persists. Normally, we would be extremely skeptical of claims linking specific weather events to climate change. However, the situation in Texas that Obama was referring to could be described as something broader than a specific weather event, and there is peer-reviewed evidence linking broader climate change in the American southwest with the incidence of wildfires in the region.

The Texas state climatologist recently wrote that he believes climate change has had an effect in encouraging the current wildfires, but only as a modest contributing factor. This caution, combined with the difficulty of determining cause and effect in a system as complex as the earth’s atmosphere, leads us to rate Obama’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2011/sep/28/barack-obama/barack-obama-slams-rick-perry-climate-change-citin/

Mark Neumann, the first Republican to enter the 2012 U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin, says it would make perfect business sense to balance the federal budget at the current revenue level of $2.3 trillion -- immediately.

And although he says it is more practical and realistic to phase it in over time, he frames the issue in terms of what balancing the budget means for a typical family.

We interviewed the former GOP congressman after listening to his Sept. 16, 2011, appearance on Wisconsin Public Television’s ""Here and Now"" program.

On the show, Neumann described his view of narrow federal government authority, his hopes for across-the-board tax-rate cuts and his emphasis on as-yet unspecified spending cuts.

And the former math teacher unveiled an ear-catching bit of budget arithmetic:

""Let me lay out a number for you, it’s a staggering number,"" Neumann told anchor Frederica Freyberg. ""Did you know that if the federal government spent $30,000 on behalf of every family of four or group of four in America, that the federal budget would be balanced today? They’re spending $46,000 on behalf of every family of four in America today, every year.""

He concluded: ""If that number was $30,000 -- $30,000 is a lot of money – – if they spent $30,000 on behalf of every family of four, the federal budget would be balanced today.""

With fiscal matters likely to dominate the race to replace U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl, the four-term Democrat, we thought it was worth checking Neumann’s math and to explore the point he was making with it.

First, we did a little homework of our own.

Balancing the budget immediately would be a dramatic move.

In 2011, the U.S. government is expected to run a 35% deficit -- spending $1.28 trillion more than the $2.3 trillion in revenue it takes in, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates.

We asked Neumann his timetable for how quickly it could be balanced and he said less than nine years -- maybe five or seven. He promised a detailed spending cut plan as the campaign unfolds.

He said a phase-in is dictated by political realities, and avoiding a shock to the economy that an all-at-once change might bring.

Neumann told us that he’d like to see federal spending sink even lower than $30,000 a year per family of four -- and it can, he said, if people take more personal responsibility for their lives.

Now let’s look at the math, and Neumann’s presentation of it.

To be sure, Neumann is not talking about actually sending money to any families, and he’s not suggesting that all families receive the same benefits. What he means is that the federal government exists to serve the public, so every expense – from the White House light bill to the cost of a grenade launcher – is ""spent"" on the public.  By taking the total amount of money the government spends, dividing the U.S. population by four and spreading the money evenly over that theoretical family, Neumann arrives at the $46,000 amount.

We crunched the numbers ourselves and asked three outside experts for help: all agreed Neumann’s math is on target.

And if the government pulled back and only spent what it actually took in, the per-four amount would be about $30,000.

Neumann told us he chose a family of four because it was a common size.

Some federal budget experts found mild fault with Neumann’s approach, but none said it was misleading.

A better way to illustrate the size of the budget is by households, the standard unit used by the U.S. Census Bureau, said Chris Edwards, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute. Based on that measure, the current figure is about $30,000 per household, compared with the $46,000 figure that Neumann’s approach generated.

Jason Peuquet of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan budget-hawk group, said Neumann’s numbers didn’t provide a very useful road map to thinking about solutions.

""We do need to start thinking about bringing spending and revenues more in line, but given the depth of our fiscal challenges we likely won’t be able to fully ‘balance the budget’ this decade,"" Peuquet said.

Neumann said he would outline his proposals for entitlement reform and other moves later in the campaign.

He’ll face tough choices, said Scott Lilly, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress.

The federal government’s growth has been fueled by spending on wars and the aging of the population, Lilly said. ""The first problem we can fix by agreeing that if we are going to war we will raise the taxes to pay for it.  The second we can fix by raising taxes or cutting benefits.""

Our conclusion

Neumann said you could balance the federal budget by reducing the amount spent from $46,000 per family of four to $30,000 -- a reduced amount that is, in his view, still too high.

We can’t rule on his opinion, but the math claim adds up. It’s not a common calculation and therefore limited in its meaning, but experts agreed it’s not misleading. We rate the statement True.",/factchecks/2011/sep/28/mark-neumann/mark-neumann-says-federal-government-spends-46000-/

Did Beltline pay $3.5 million for less than a 1/4 acre?
","
In recent years, most political and business leaders in the city of Atlanta have hailed the Atlanta Beltline project as a marvel of modern development.

The vision: safe, vibrant neighborhoods with more parks and trails along a 22-mile loop of mostly abandoned rail lines that will be connected to existing MARTA and future transit systems. It’s expected to be several years before the Beltline is fully developed.

""The Atlanta Beltline is the most comprehensive economic development effort ever undertaken in the city of Atlanta and among the largest, most wide-ranging urban redevelopment projects currently under way in the United States,"" Atlanta Beltline Inc., the operational arm of the effort, says on its website.

Some government watchdogs are not so impressed. They see the Beltline as a project fraught with overspending. One group recently put out a newsletter with what it says is an inexcusable example of government waste. A PolitiFact reader asked us to check it out.

The Fulton County Taxpayers Foundation’s September newsletter, titled ""The Atlanta Beltline: Is It Feasible?,"" contained a claim that Beltline officials wildly overspent on the purchase of a small piece of land in Atlanta’s Old Fourth Ward.

""Several parcels were purchased by Georgia Power from the city of Atlanta and then sold back to the Atlanta Beltline Inc. for seemly huge profits,"" the group’s president, John Sherman, wrote in the newsletter. ""O Dallas Street, .1756 acre, was sold to Georgia Power on Nov. 30, 2002, by the city of Atlanta for $350,000 and resold to the Atlanta Beltline Inc. on Dec. 21, 2007, for $3,485,000.""

In an e-mail, the foundation called it ""the highest price ever paid for land.""

Did the Beltline really pay nearly $3.5 million for less than a quarter-acre?

Beltline spokesman Ethan Davidson said Sherman was way off track on that point and several other claims in his newsletter, such as how many people are on the Beltline payroll. He presented us a settlement statement that shows it was slightly more than 2 acres purchased.

Sherman countered with Fulton County tax records of his own to claim he’s correct.

So who’s right here?

For much of the past decade, Sherman has been one of the most vocal critics of spending practices at City Hall. He’s argued that Atlanta should more frequently consider ""managed competition,"" the idea of allowing private companies to bid for government contracts if they can do the work as well as the city and for less money. The foundation says its newsletters go out to tens of thousands of readers. The newsletter was mentioned in an Atlanta Progressive News article.

Stan Anderson, a former manager at the Fulton County tax assessor’s office, noticed the Beltline was buying land for more than what he believed it is worth. Anderson, who helps people appeal their property assessments for the foundation, alerted Sherman to some of these purchases.

The land in question lies near a portion of the Beltline located close to the old City Hall East site, the massive brick building that was once the headquarters for Atlanta’s police and fire departments. After years of effort, the city finally sold the property this summer to developers who plan to convert it into a mix of residential and office space.

Georgia Power did indeed sell land for nearly $3.5 million in late 2007 to the Atlanta Beltline Inc. That was before the Great Recession and when Atlanta’s intown real estate market was considered a great investment. It’s been converted into trails and green space and now called the Historic Fourth Ward Park.

The big question: Was the land less than a quarter of an acre, as Sherman wrote in the newsletter? Or was it 2.1 acres, as Beltline officials told us?

Georgia Power spokeswoman Konswello Monroe said the sale included several parcels that totaled more than 2 acres. Sherman connected us with Anderson, who said the Beltline and Georgia Power were correct. Anderson believes Sherman may not have added all six parcels before hitting the send button on his newsletter.

""I don’t think Mr. Sherman had any intention of misleading anybody,"" Anderson said. ""He was upset about the amount [the Beltline was] paying per acre.""

Sherman stressed those concerns in some of his conversations with us after learning of the error.

""Even if you took their figures, the cost of the land is more than $1.5 million an acre,"" he said. ""This is absolutely crazy.""

Sherman also wonders why the Beltline paid nearly 10 times what Georgia Power bought the land for five years earlier. Did the Beltline overpay for the land?

""No, because that was fair market value in 2007,"" Davidson, the Beltline spokesman, said.

Davidson also argues the project has saved the city money. The city initially wanted to use the property as part of a tunnel to manage sewer overflow that Atlanta Watershed Management officials wrote in one document would have cost $40 million. The creation of a stormwater retention pond at the park cost less than $30 million, city officials say.

The bottom line here is Sherman’s newsletter correctly stated how much the Beltline purchased the property for, but was wrong about the size of the property, creating a false impression for anyone who read it.

Mitt Romney says illegal immigrants get a $100,000 break on University of Texas tuition over four years
","
The Sept. 22, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Orlando delivered more criticism of Texas Gov. Rick Perry for his stance on offering certain illegal immigrants in Texas the same college tuition that legal residents pay.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney gave a number that especially resonates in Austin: ""To go to the University of Texas, if you're an illegal alien, you get an in-state tuition discount. You know how much that is? That's $22,000 a year.""

Romney added: ""Four years of college, almost $100,000 discount if you are an illegal alien (and) go to the University of Texas.""

On Tuesday, Romney's campaign featured that debate moment in a web ad hammering Perry on the issue. 
Conveniently, we recently completed a related fact-check on a claim that Rick Santorum made in the Sept. 12 Republican presidential debate, so we had a few numbers ready to hand. Based on data from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the average gap between in-state and out-of-state tuition at Texas public universities in 2011 was $9,800: A non-resident, full-time student would be expected to pay an estimated $17,000 in tuition and fees, while an in-state resident would pay $7,200.

That $9,800 is much smaller than the ""discount"" Romney cited for UT, but the board confirms that UT’s tuition rates are higher than average and the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition is higher. The in-state costs at UT were the second-highest and UT’s out-of-state tuition was the highest among Texas’ 37 public universities that reported 2011 estimates to the board.

Romney’s campaign cited U.S. News and World Report UT tuition figures for 2011-12 of $9,794 in-state and $32,506 out-of-state. When we inquired, the coordinating board cited the same figures, rounded, from UT in calculating its averages: $9,800 in-state and $32,500 out-of-state tuition. Those numbers yield a ""discount"" of $22,700 -- the biggest gap between in-state and out-of-state resident tuition among the 37 Texas public universities that reported 2011 estimates to the board. The next biggest differences: UT-Dallas, $17,026; Texas A&M University, $15,390; and University of Houston-Clear Lake, $10,838. Nearly all the rest report a difference of $9,400 or less.

So, Romney’s ""discount"" of $22,000 for a year at UT holds up, but his extrapolation of ""almost $100,000"" across four years is a bit dodgier. The real difference (presuming the 2011-12 tuition charges hold for four years) would be $90,800. Probably most college students would find the $9,200 difference to be significant.

However, not only is UT one of the most expensive schools Romney could have picked for this example, but very few of the illegal immigrants receiving this tuition break choose to attend UT.

To get the in-state rate, illegal immigrants must have a Texas high school diploma or GED, have lived in Texas for at least three years and sign an affidavit of their intention to apply for permanent residency. Only 16,476 students in Texas took this affidavit route in 2010, and only 612 of those — about 4 percent — went to UT, said Dominic Chavez, senior director for external relations with the higher education board. Most of the ""affidavit"" students in Texas, by far, choose community colleges, he said; 73 percent of the total 16,476 affidavit students did so in 2010. (The breakdown: 4,403 went to public universities; 12,028 chose community colleges; the remaining 45 students went to public health-related institutions, where the average ""discount"" was $10,800 -- an example is the UT Medical Branch at Galveston.)

And for those community college students, the in-state reduction on tuition is smaller: between $1,600 and $2,600. Though the residency requirements and categories differ from those at public universities, the lowest rate for which students (including affidavit students) can qualify is the ""in-district"" rate. Among the 53 community colleges reporting 2011 estimates to the Texas coordinating board, the average in-district tuition was $2,200; the average out-of-district tuition was $3,200; and the average non-resident (out-of-state) tuition was $4,800.

To take a step back and view the big picture: Of 1.3 million college students in Texas in 2010, 1.2 percent (16,476) were illegal immigrants receiving tuition breaks through the affidavit route. (The even bigger picture: Texas’ 1.65 million illegal immigrants made up 6.7 percent of the state’s total population in 2010, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.)

Stated another way, only 1 percent of Texas’ illegal immigrants got the in-state rates in 2010. And of those, 73 percent got an average reduction of $2,600 or less; the remaining 27 percent average closer to $10,000 per year.

So let’s return to Romney’s statement: ""Four years of college, almost $100,000 discount if you are an illegal alien (and) go to the University of Texas.""

For the 612 affidavit students at the University of Texas last year, Romney’s figure of $22,000 per year is approximately correct, even a bit low; but quadrupling the real average adds up to $90,800 over four years, not $100,000.

Not only is that UT tuition break the very highest that Romney could have cited among Texas public universities, it went to only 4 percent of the illegal immigrants who received in-state tuition rates last year.

The vast majority of affidavit students in Texas last year got an average in-state tuition reduction of $1,600 to $2,600. If they got that rate for four years, the total ""discount"" would be $6,400 to $10,400. And that group of 12,028 community college affidavit students made up less than 1 percent of the 1,364,911 college students enrolled in Texas last year.

Romney’s $100,000 figure is only $9,200 off the mark for the University of Texas, but with 73 percent of affidavit students receiving $10,400 or less over four years, his choice to use UT as an example gives a skewed representation of the reality of illegal immigrants seeking college education in Texas.

Rep. Dennis Kucinich says the Fed created $1.2 trillion out of nothing to aid banks
","
U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich wants to put people back to work, but since the private sector has not had much success, he wants to prime the economic pump by spending public money on roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects.

There’s plenty of demand out there, Kucinich told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto on Sept. 7, pointing to an American Society of Civil Engineers report identifying an immense need for infrastructure repairs and rebuilding.

But where would the money come from? States and local governments don’t have those kinds of dollars, Kucinich rightly pointed out. But, the Ohio Democrat added, the federal government does.

""We just found out the other day that the Fed created $1.2 trillion out of nothing, gave it to banks, and some of them foreign banks, so that they could stabilize their operations,"" he told Cavuto.

That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. After all, how can anybody simply create $1.2 trillion out of nothing?

Well, it turns out Kucinich was pretty much on the money, no pun intended.

Let’s take the first part of his sentence, that the Fed created $1.2 trillion out of nothing.

The ""Fed"" in this case is the Federal Reserve, our country’s central bank. It’s the job of the Fed to use monetary policy to keep inflation in check and to stimulate the economy to create jobs. It does this by buying and selling government-backed securities that either increase or decrease the amount of money in circulation.

The Federal Reserve also serves as the lender of last resort to its member banks who are having liquidity problems and can’t go to other banks for short-term loans.

With that in mind, let’s go back to 2008 and 2009 when the United States banking system was on the brink of disaster. Then-President George W. Bush created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, TARP, to buy up banks’ bad investments and later to infuse the institutions with badly needed capital. In Cleveland, PNC National Bank used TARP money to buy troubled National City.

TARP, however, is not what Kucinich was talking about. TARP was orchestrated by the U.S. Treasury and used money borrowed from the sale of U.S. securities such as Treasury bills.

Nor was he talking about the $800 billion stimulus package of 2009, much of which was in the form of tax cuts.

Kucinich was talking about $1.2 trillion that the Federal Reserve had on loan, primarily to banks, at the peak of its emergency lending during the financial crisis. The figure comes from a Bloomberg News investigative story this past summer that analyzed detailed loan information released by the Federal Reserve.

Indeed, many banks did get money. Morgan Stanley at $107.3 billion received the most, followed by Citigroup at $99.5 billion and Bank of America at $91.4 billion.

The loans, however, were not handed out the way your bank down the street dispenses money, explained Walker Todd, former assistant general counsel to the Federal Reserve banks in Cleveland and New York City.

Regular banks are limited in how much they can loan based on their access to money, be it deposits or other forms of financing. ""But the Fed, uniquely among institutions in our society, gets to create money out of thin air,"" Todd said.

It does so by simply increasing the balance in a member bank’s account. No actual money is printed. It just shows up in the electronic ledger, new money that never existed before that’s now in circulation, boosting the aggregate money supply.

Each bank, however, did have to put up assets as collateral in case the money wasn’t repaid. Some of those assets, according to Bloomberg, were junk bonds.

Eventually, all the money was repaid, with interest. But according to Todd, rather than wipe the money off its books, the Federal Reserve chose to use much of it to further stimulate the economy by purchasing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage-backed securities on the open market. So that money remained in circulation.

Finally, what about Kucinich’s claim that some of the $1.2 trillion went to foreign banks? Again, Kucinich was correct. Two of the several foreign banks getting help were Royal Bank of Scotland Plc at $84.5 billion and UBS AG of Switzerland at $77.2 billion. The Federal Reserve treats foreign banks operating in the United States the same as U.S. banks because they are all part of the same financial system.

On a side note, even some companies, including General Electric, received emergency cash.

So while Kucinich’s comment that ""the Fed created $1.2 trillion out of nothing, gave it to banks and some of them foreign banks so that they could stabilize their operations"" is a bit flip, maybe even pejorative, he was essentially correct in describing the unique money-creating capabilities of the Federal Reserve and how it was used.

Herman Cain said government bureaucrats will determine when you get a CAT scan once the new health care law begins
","
Herman Cain said at a Republican presidential candidates' debate last week that he would be dead if his cancer had occurred while ""Obamacare"" was in effect.

Cain had made the statement previously, so Chris Wallace of Fox News asked him about it at the debate sponsored by Fox News and Google in Orlando, Fla.

Wallace: ""Mr. Cain, you are a survivor of Stage 4 colon and liver cancer. And you say if 'Obamacare' had been -- (Here Wallace was interrupted by sustained cheers and applause) and we all share in the happiness about your situation, but you say if 'Obamacare' had been in effect when you were first being treated, you'd be dead now. Why?"" 
Cain: ""The reason I said that I would be dead on 'Obamacare' is because my cancer was detected in March of 2006. And from March 2006 all the way to the end of 2006, for that number of months, I was able to get the necessary CAT scan tests, go to the necessary doctors, get a second opinion, get chemotherapy, go to get surgery, recuperate from surgery, get more chemotherapy in a span of nine months.

""If we had been on 'Obamacare' and a bureaucrat was trying to tell me when I could get that CAT scan, that would have delayed my treatment. My surgeons and doctors have told me that because I was able to get the treatment as fast as I could, based upon my timetable, and not the government's timetable, that's what saved my life, because I only had a 30 percent chance of survival. And now I'm here five years cancer-free because I could do it on my timetable and not on a bureaucrat's timetable. This is one of the reasons I believe a lot of people are objecting to 'Obamacare,' because we need to get bureaucrats out of the business of trying to micromanage health care in this nation."" 
 ""Obamacare,"" in case you haven't figured it out yet, is the Republicans' often mocking name for the health care law that President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010. Some of the changes resulting from the law have already taken effect, including sons and daughters under 26 being allowed to be covered by their parents' health insurance. But many major provisions don't begin until 2014. 
Here's the general way the new law works: The major health insurance systems are left in place, especially the health insurance coverage people get through work and Medicare. For people who have to buy insurance on their own, the government adds new regulations for health insurance companies to follow. States will create ""exchanges,"" which are virtual marketplaces where people will be able to comparison shop for insurance. The law says that everyone must have insurance or pay a tax penalty. (That's called the individual mandate, and it's being challenged in federal courts.) People who make modest incomes will qualify for tax breaks to help them buy insurance, and very poor people will be eligible for Medicaid.

What the law is not is a single-payer system, as in Canada, where the government picks up the bills; nor is it a nationalized system like Great Britain's where the government owns hospitals and employs doctors. So if those are the systems Cain had in mind, that's not what the new health care law is. (We asked Cain's campaign what the basis was for his statement, but we didn't hear back.)

Even for people over age 65 in Medicare -- the part of the health care system that most resembles a single-payer plan -- private physicians would still make decisions about scans and treatments.
Still, opponents of the health care law have argued that it will eventually result in bureaucrats making decisions that affect treatment, particularly for Medicare recipients. But those claims have been rated False on our Truth-O-Meter when they have asserted that bureaucrats will make decisions about individual cases. 

For example, PolitiFact Georgia looked at a statement from Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Ga., who said that under the health care law, ""a bunch of bureaucrats decide whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy.""

Gingrey said the bureaucrats are part of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB. 
The board is a new part of the health care law, and it was created in response to criticism that Congress has been unable to make the politically risky and technically complex decisions needed to slow the growth of costs for Medicare.

Under the health care law, if Medicare spending growth is projected to exceed certain targets, the IPAB must come up with plans to slow the increase. If Congress does not act on the recommendation within a set time frame, the IPAB's plans are automatically implemented. 

Both sides of the aisle have problems with the board. Some worry it will be too hard for Congress to overrule IPAB recommendations or that the board will stifle innovation. In recent months, several members of Congress from both parties have signed on to repeal the board.

But saying that the IPAB will determine the course of treatment for individual cases is an entirely different matter -- and it's factually incorrect. Even people who oppose the IPAB agree that it will not intervene in the cases of individual patients but will rather determine how much the government pays health care providers for various services. It can also reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of readmission or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. (See PolitiFact Georgia's fact-check for more details on the IPAB.)

But we should point out here that the IPAB applies to Medicare. Medicare is a government-run health insurance program for those over age 65. When Cain was diagnosed with cancer in March 2006, he would have been 60 -- too young for Medicare. So the IPAB wouldn't even have applied, even if it had been in effect at the time. 
We don't know the personal details of Cain's health status or how he is insured. But it's impossible for us to see how a government bureaucrat could have delayed Cain's care. Cain said at the debate that, ""If we had been on 'Obamacare' and a bureaucrat was trying to tell me when I could get that CAT scan, that would have delayed my treatment."" But there is no part of the health care law that allows a government bureaucrat to weigh in on an individual's course of treatment -- not Cain's nor anyone else's.

Barack Obama says construction workers pay higher tax rate than someone earning $50 million a year
","
In several appearances recently, President Barack Obama has emphasized tax fairness across the income spectrum.

In remarks in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Sept. 22, 2011, Obama sought to promote his American Jobs Act by visiting a ""functionally obsolete"" bridge spanning the Ohio River. The bill, he said, ""would put people back to work rebuilding America -- repairing our roads, repairing our bridges, repairing our schools.""

During the speech, Obama said that ""a construction worker who’s making $50 or $60 grand a year shouldn’t be paying higher tax rates than the guy who’s making $50 million a year. And that’s how it’s working right now.  Because they get all these loopholes and tax breaks that you don’t get.""

A few days before Obama’s visit to the bridge, we published a story analyzing a similar comment Obama made in a speech on the economy.

""Middle-class families shouldn’t pay higher taxes than millionaires and billionaires,"" Obama said in the earlier speech. ""That’s pretty straightforward. It’s hard to argue against that. Warren Buffett’s secretary shouldn’t pay a higher tax rate than Warren Buffett. There is no justification for it. It is wrong that in the United States of America, a teacher or a nurse or a construction worker who earns $50,000 should pay higher tax rates than somebody pulling in $50 million. Anybody who says we can’t change the tax code to correct that, anyone who has signed some pledge to protect every single tax loophole so long as they live, they should be called out. They should have to defend that unfairness -- explain why somebody who's making $50 million a year in the financial markets should be paying 15 percent on their taxes, when a teacher making $50,000 a year is paying a higher rate.""

We received many requests from readers to fact-check this comparison. But we decided we weren’t able to rate Obama’s claims on the Truth-O-Meter because we don't do Truth-O-Meter items on ""shoulds"" or ""shouldn'ts."" Those are opinions, not facts.

However, in his Cincinnati speech, Obama did make a comment that was Truth-O-Meter-ready. By saying ""and that’s how it’s working now,"" Obama is saying this pattern of taxation is a common practice.

Is it?

We found an IRS chart for tax year 2008 that shows a variety of tax information broken down into 18 ranges of adjusted gross income for the filer.

This chart lists three types of tax returns -- filers who have income for a child who earns more than $1,900 (meaning the child’s income is taxed at the parent’s rate); those who have income reported on Schedule D (primarily capital gains); and those without either of these types of income. For the purposes of our calculations, we are combining data for all three types of returns.

According to this chart, slightly fewer than 19 million filers reported adjusted gross income between $50,000 and $75,000. (This income range stretches slightly higher than what the president mentioned, but it’s as close as we can get with available statistics.) The average income tax rate for these returns was 8.3 percent for those with Schedule D income and 7.8 percent for filers with neither Schedule D nor child income. The rate was higher for those with child income -- 20.4 percent -- but this group included only 4,543 returns, or two-tenths of one percent of all returns in that income range, which is small enough to be negligible for our purposes.

The bottom line is that taxpayers in Obama’s construction-worker income range tended to pay an effective federal income tax rate of 7 percent to 8 percent.

Calculating the comparable figure for those earning $50 million was trickier.

The same chart provides a figure for returns with at least $10 million in adjusted gross income. There were 11,050 returns in this category, and their effective federal income tax rate ranged from 17.9 percent to 28.5 percent, depending on which of the three filing categories they fell into.

Clearly, then, the $10 million plus crowd is paying a higher average tax rate than the $50,000 to $75,000 crowd. But remember that Obama said $50 million, not $10 million. Does the math change for those who are even richer?

The best data we could find addresses the 400 highest-income taxpayers in the nation. In 2008, the cutoff to make it into this rarefied group was an income of $109.7 million -- which is above Obama’s $50 million threshold. These taxpayers had an average federal income tax rate of 18.1 percent, which is also higher than the rate paid by the $50,000 to $75,000 crowd.

So by these calculations, Obama would be incorrect in most cases.

But that’s not the end of the story. These figures are for federal income taxes only. There are also a bunch of other federal taxes that could, and probably should, be included in the calculation. The burden for some some taxes, including corporate taxes, excise taxes and estate taxes, are hard to attribute to individual returns, so we’ll set those aside. But one federal tax is straightforward to throw into our calculations: payroll taxes.

Payroll taxes fund Social Security and Medicare. In general, payroll taxes hit lower-to-middle-income taxpayers harder than high-income taxpayers, for two reasons. First, workers with low to moderate incomes are more likely than rich taxpayers to make the bulk of their income from salaries and wages, which are subject to the payroll tax, rather than capital gains or other types of investment income, which are not subject to payroll taxes. For the very rich, that pattern is reversed. Second, Social Security tax is levied only on the first $108,600 of one’s salary, meaning that virtually all of the earnings of someone making $50,000 a year is subject to it. That wouldn’t be the case for someone who’s very rich.

We asked two researchers at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institute Tax Policy Center, Roberton Williams and Rachel Johnson, for their advice on how to factor in payroll taxes. They estimated that combining the workers’ share of the payroll tax with the employer’s share -- the usual practice among economists -- would mean an extra 15 percentage points for our hypothetical middle-class worker, and less than 2 additional percentage points for the high-income taxpayer.

Adding these to the percentages we previously found for the income tax alone produces a new, ""final"" rate of 22 to 23 percent for the construction worker and 20 to 30 percent for the $50 million earner.

So it’s certainly possible that a given construction worker pays a higher effective tax rate than a given $50 million earner -- but it’s also not a guarantee. There is a lot of variation for taxpayers in both categories -- especially when you consider that we have been using average tax rates rather than median tax rates, which means that a small number of very high incomes can throw off the average.

Our ruling

Obama has made a sweeping statement that it’s common, even typical, for a $50,000-a-year construction worker to pay a higher tax rate than someone earning $50 million a year. The reality is that it’s hard to know for sure.

We found that a typical taxpayer with $50,000 in income pays 22 to 23 percent in income and payroll taxes, while the comparable rates for very, very wealthy taxpayers are in the 20 to 30 percent range. The data isn’t specific enough for us to be able to say if a majority of $50 million earners pay tax rates at the low or high end of that 20 to 30 percent range. We do think it’s safe to say that some of those very high earners pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than workers who earn $50,000, and some don’t. So, on balance, we rate the statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/sep/27/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-construction-workers-pay-higher-/

Gov. Rick Scott's primary math: Florida has more people than early primary and caucus states combined
","
Gov. Rick Scott rallied Republican activists at Florida's Presidency 5 straw poll with an argument for the state's supremacy in choosing the party's presidential contender.

""None will have a greater impact on the selection of the nominee than our own primary in the Sunshine State,"" Scott told a crowd of 3,500 on Sept. 24, 2011.

While other primaries or caucuses might be earlier, he said, Florida's population and diversity set it apart.

""At nearly 19 million people, the population of Florida is larger than all the earlier primary and caucus states combined,"" he said.

The Republican National Committee allows just Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada to vote in February 2012 without penalty.

Florida has yet to choose its primary date. But state lawmakers would like to see it as early as possible, saying it better reflects the country than the four ""early"" states and should play an agenda-setting role.

As Scott made his plea, we wondered: Is the population of Florida larger than Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada combined? We turned to the U.S. Census Bureau: 
2010 population 
Iowa: 3 million
New Hampshire: 1.3 million
South Carolina: 4.6 million
Nevada: 2.7 million
Total: 11.7 million

Florida: 18.8 million

So, Scott's right on. Florida's ""nearly 19 million people"" does eclipse the early states' nearly 12 million. (Now, that doesn't tell us who actually votes there — but he didn't say voters, so we won't quibble.)

Broun: Stimulus money funded effort that will kill jobs
","
Hey, Chester the Cheetah. You think it ain’t easy bein’ cheesy?

Well, U.S. Rep. Paul Broun of Athens says that the federal government wants to hang your hide on its wall. And it could take down hundreds of thousands of jobs with you.  

Republican Broun tweeted his concern for the Cheetos snack food mascot during President Barack Obama’s Sept. 8 jobs speech before Congress. Food company critics are targeting Chester for extinction because they think using cartoon characters to sell junk food fuels childhood obesity.  

As you may remember, Broun has taken to sitting out joint sessions, such as January’s State of the Union Address, so he can tweet critiques of the president real-time.

Chester came up in the second of a four-part list explaining why Broun thinks the country doesn’t need the new jobs bill. The president could simply change his policies, Broun argued.

""2) Stimulus $ study on food advertising: proj -$28.3 billion in sales and -378,000 #jobs – just to keep Chester the Cheetah off the air,"" he tweeted.

Feds are willing to kill off that much of the economy to restrict food marketing to children? And they’re doing this with stimulus money?

Chester better trade those sunglasses for a bulletproof vest. And we’d better check Broun’s facts.

In 2009, Congress created the Interagency Working Group on Food Marketed to Children to study and recommend standards for efforts with a large audience of 17 years old or younger.

In April, the working group recommended voluntary guidelines that would reduce kids’ exposure to pitches for products that don’t meet certain nutritional guidelines. Targeting children through television, radio, print, company-sponsored websites, email and text messaging, product placement, toy branding, sports team sponsorships, and other methods would cease.

Chester’s defenders pounced. A Broun spokesman referred us to an Aug. 29 paper published by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.

It said that ""even the working group concluded that the guidelines would result in a 20 percent reduction in ad expenditures that would in turn cause losses of $28.3 billion in manufacturing and retail sales and 378,000 jobs lost by 2015.""

But the working group did not come to this conclusion. Economic analysis firm IHS Global Insight wrote the report.

We also noticed that the Heritage Foundation’s numbers are off, as are those in Broun’s tweet. The IHS report actually says that from 2011 through 2015, lost sales would total $152 billion. The predicted loss of $28.3 billion is for 2011 alone.

Furthermore, stimulus dollars did not fund the group, as Broun asserted. Records show the board was created by a separate bill and was funded by the regular budgets of the agencies involved.  

Now, IHS Global Insight’s analysis does not fit the accepted definition of a ""study,"" as Broun called it. It wasn’t peer-reviewed or conducted by an independent professional. It was funded by opponents of the guidelines. Most importantly, its methodology wasn’t transparent.

Broun spokeswoman Meredith Griffanti and IHS spokesman Mike Raimondi defended the IHS report, saying the firm is well-regarded (it is the successor to a research organization founded by a 1980 winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics) and guideline opponents were not fishing for numbers to suit their claims.

Food manufactures actually thought IHS’ report underestimated how much the guidelines would hurt the economy, Griffanti said.  

Raimondi said he could not provide detailed information on the findings because IHS did not write a more comprehensive report. He said the results were based on federal and industry data and decades of research.

PolitiFact Georgia showed IHS’ report to three marketing professors.

They all had reservations with the report’s fundamental assumption: that food and beverage advertising spending would drop 20 percent. IHS did not publish how it reached its conclusions, so other experts cannot check them.

""Based on this type of reasoning without any support, I could just as easily assume that there would be smaller decreases. There’s no way of telling,"" said Jerome Williams, a Rutgers University marketing professor who has studied food marketing to children.

In fact, marketing spending might not decline at all, experts said. Companies could redirect the cash to promote healthier kids foods or sell salty snacks to grown-ups.  

IHS did not look into this possibility, Raimondi said.

Ad spending could even increase, Williams said. After the federal government banned cigarette advertising on radio and television in 1971, U.S. cigarette marketing spending grew. In 1970, it totaled $361 million, according to the Federal Trade Commission. In 1975, it was more than $491 million; in 1976, it was $639 million.

Broun’s camp rejected the tobacco analogy because the proposed voluntary guidelines would block ads on shows with big adult audiences, as well as marketing techniques beyond broadcast such as product placement.

That said, independent scholars haven’t corroborated the IHS report, noted University of Arizona professor Dale Kunkel, an expert on food marketing to children.

And while the voluntary guidelines could lead to job losses, they could also create jobs for those who develop and market healthier foods, Emory University marketing professor Douglas Bowman said.

Published reports show that food manufactures are innovating in response to child obesity concerns. For instance, Cheetos no longer advertises to children, but the brand is still growing, especially in the Latino market, an executive said last year during a PepsiCo investor event. He said it was rolling out Cheetos with less sodium and fat in Brazil.

Griffanti said job creation is unlikely because food companies are continuously updating their products.

In sum, while Broun does have a point that jobs could be affected by the guidelines, his claim is deeply flawed.

Stimulus dollars did not fund the group that produced the voluntary guidelines. The report that predicted major economic losses was not a true study. Plus, there’s evidence to think that advertising spending won’t plummet.

And since the guidelines are voluntary, companies could avoid implementing the bits they think would be too tough on their bottom lines. Or they could ignore them altogether.

Chester, take heart. You still have a chance. We rate Broun’s claim False.",/factchecks/2011/sep/27/paul-broun/broun-stimulus-money-funded-effort-will-kill-jobs/

Republican Tommy Thompson says Club for Growth Wisconsin ""has endorsed"" him for U.S. Senate
","
Perhaps the loudest voice in opposition to a Tommy Thompson candidacy for the U.S. Senate has been the conservative Club for Growth. The national anti-tax group has repeatedly accused him of spending too much as Wisconsin’s governor and later supporting President Barack Obama’s health care reform.

Thompson, a Republican who has said he will run in 2012 for the seat being vacated by Wisconsin Democrat Herb Kohl, was asked about the criticism on the ABC News ""TopLine"" program on Sept. 12, 2011.

Thompson called the national Club for Growth’s accusations -- made in statements, in an online ad and in a national TV ad -- false. Then he mentioned Club for Growth Wisconsin, saying:

""It’s nice to point out that the state Club for Growth, the people in the state of Wisconsin, have endorsed me and support me and say that the national Club for Growth is just plain wrong in their assertions and accusations.""

We’ve already rated Half True the national Club for Growth’s claim that Thompson, who left the governor’s office in 2001 to serve as President George W. Bush’s health and human services secretary, supported what Republicans dubbed ""Obamacare.""

What struck us about the ABC interview was Thompson’s claim that Club for Growth Wisconsin had endorsed him.

That’s because a statement issued two weeks before Thompson’s interview by Club for Growth Wisconsin, which was founded in 2004, said the state group ""shares the same economic agenda"" as the national group, but is ""a completely independent and separate organization.""

The statement also said that under its charter, Club for Growth Wisconsin ""takes no position"" on federal candidates: ""We do NOT get involved in federal elections.""

(Conversely, the national Club for Growth says it endorses only federal candidates.)

We asked Darrin Schmitz, a spokesman for Thompson’s campaign, about Thompson’s claim of being endorsed by Club for Growth Wisconsin.

Schmitz said Thompson was referring to an endorsement from Terry and Mary Kohler, who Schmitz said are founding members of Club for Growth Wisconsin. He argued Thompson clarified his remark when he said ""the people"" endorsed him because that was a reference to the Kohlers as founding members of the state group.

Hmmm.

Thompson said ""the people of Wisconsin,"" not people associated with Club for Growth Wisconsin. He didn’t announce the Kohlers’ endorsement until three days after the ABC interview. And an endorsement by individual members of a group -- however influential -- is not the same as an endorsement by the group itself.

What’s more, Club for Growth Wisconsin doesn’t even endorse in federal races.

Our conclusion

In trying to fend off criticism from the national Club for Growth, Thompson told a national TV audience he has been endorsed by Club for Growth Wisconsin in his U.S. Senate bid.

He hasn’t been. And, under the group’s charter, couldn’t be.

House Speaker John Boehner says 10,000 baby boomers retire every day
","
Since President Obama launched his offensive to tout initiatives he believes will create jobs and revive the economy, House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio has provided  a steady Republican counterpoint.

Boehner appeared Sept. 19, 2011, on Fox Business Network, where he described Obama’s call for higher taxes on millionaires as ""class warfare,"" and advised the president to ""tackle the spending problem.""

""What we’re seeing out of the president’s so-called deficit reduction package is more of the same,"" Boehner told interviewer Gerri Willis. ""It’s class warfare, not serious about dealing with the real drivers of our debt. And that’s major entitlement programs.

""We have 10,000 baby boomers retiring every day. It’s time for us to get serious about ensuring that these programs are going to be there for them.""

That’s a lot of retirees. PolitiFact Ohio was intrigued and took a look at the speaker’s claim.

The claim is similar to one made by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor that our counterparts at PolitiFact Virginia examined. We’ll incorporate some of their findings here, too.

Baby boomers comprise a large demographic group of Americans who were born between Jan. 1, 1946 and Dec. 31, 1964. Their pending departure from the workforce is expected to significantly stress the retirement system.

According to the Social Security System’s Annual Performance Plan for Fiscal Year 2012: ""Nearly 80 million baby boomers will file for retirement benefits over the next 20 years – an average of 10,000 per day."" That bears out the statistic cited by Boehner.

A 2010 Pew Research Center study says baby boomers comprise 26 percent of the total U.S. population. After 2030 - when that generation reaches retirement age - Pew projects that 18 percent of the nation’s population will be over age 65, compared with 13 percent today.

Census data collected by Pew indicates the estimated number of retires could be even greater than 10,000 per day. According to Pew’s data, 76 million people were born in the United States between 1946 and 1964. After subtracting those who died and adding immigrants born during those years, America has 79.6 million people of that generation.

If you divide 79.6 million by 19 years (the number remaining until 2030), then divide that by 365 days, you get a daily average of 11,476 people turning 65. Although not everyone in that age group will live to reach age 65, the amount who will end up retiring each day could significantly exceed Boehner’s 10,000 per day figure.

Boehner’s statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. We rule his claim True.",/factchecks/2011/sep/26/john-boehner/house-speaker-john-boehner-says-10000-baby-boomers/

UPDATED: Ron Paul says ""our taxes"" doubled under Rick Perry
","
CORRECTION, 4:45 p.m. Jan. 17, 2012: This fact check originally presented per-capita state and local sales tax collections for 2000 and 2010 attributed to information from the U.S. Census Bureau. But, as a reader helpfully pointed out, those figures solely reflected state taxes. This article has been revised accordingly. The changes do not affect our rating of the statement. 
U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, asked if he credits Texas Gov. Rick Perry for job gains in their home state, replied : ""Not quite.""

At the Sept. 12, 2011, CNN/Tea Party Express Republican presidential debate, Paul continued: ""I'm a taxpayer there. My taxes have gone up. Our taxes have doubled since he's been in office. Our spending has gone up double. Our debt has gone up nearly triple.""

We’ve reviewed claims about spending and debt in Perry’s decade-plus as governor.

For instance, state spending from all sources went up nearly 79 percent between 2000-01 and 2010-11, though adjusted for population and inflation, the increase was 18.2 percent. Also, as we noted last year, raw debt doubled, though last month we rated Mostly True Perry’s claim that Texas has the fourth-lowest per-person debt of any state in the nation and the lowest per-person debt of the big states.

Until Paul piped up, we hadn’t heard that taxes doubled under Perry.

Paul’s campaign offered no direct backup to his tax claim, though spokesman Gary Howard pointed out news and opinion articles on Perry’s 1987 vote as a Texas House member for the biggest tax increase in state history and on 2006 legislation Perry signed into law that increased cigarette taxes by $1 a pack, overhauled the state’s business franchise tax and changed how the state taxes the sale of used cars, all toward covering the costs of a statewide one-third cut in local school property taxes.

Later, Paul’s campaign told us he’d been referring at the debate to a doubling in his own franchise taxes. We requested, but did not field, elaboration.

The Perry-approved revamp of the state's corporate franchise tax shifted businesses from a 4.5 percent tax on a company's profit to a new approach. The change reduced the so-called margins tax rate to 1 percent while broadening its application to the annual revenue of qualifying companies minus one of three options: the cost of goods sold, the cost of employee compensation or 30 percent of total revenue.

When it was adopted, the revamped tax was expected to bring in $5.9 billion in fiscal 2008—about a 90 percent increase (not quite double) over fiscal 2007.  In fact, the tax brought in $4.5 billion that first year, a 45 percent increase. The tax continues to underperform.

Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, cautioned against judging the franchise tax in isolation, reminding us by email that the 2006 changes ""never would have been proposed, and most certainly never would have passed, had (they) not been linked to a $7 billion (statewide) property tax cut.""

Craymer’s  point: ""The overall package was a net tax cut. It was intended to be a $2.5 billion a year tax cut, but ironically because the franchise tax proved to be a smaller tax than anticipated, it ended up being a $4 billion tax cut.""

We’re not suggesting that Perry has a no-new-taxes’ record. As noted in a November 2010 fact check, Perry approved other tax hikes as governor including a 2 percent tax on the retail sale of fireworks to help fund a rural volunteer fire department insurance fund and a 1 percent tax on the purchase or rental of diesel equipment.

And tobacco users were hit again in 2009, when the Legislature voted to tax smokeless tobacco on weight rather than price, ""generating additional revenue of $105 million over two years,"" according to a May 28, 2009 Dallas Morning News news article. According to a December 2009 report from the Legislative Budget Board, some of the new revenue helps repay medical-school loans for doctors who agree to practice in under-served areas of the state. The rest was to be used to help offset franchise tax revenue that was lost when the Legislature temporarily exempted 40,000 businesses.

Phew. Take a breather?

Our previous reporting did not gauge whether taxes doubled.

To explore this aspect, we turned to annual cash reports from the Texas state comptroller’s office. In fiscal 2001, the year Perry succeeded George W. Bush as governor, the state collected $27.2 billion in taxes. In fiscal 2010, the latest completed fiscal year, the state gathered $35.4 billion in taxes.

So, unadjusted for inflation, state tax collections increased over most of Perry’s time as governor by about 30 percent.

The annual reports also include per-person calculations, yielding another way to compare changes. In fiscal 2001, the state collected $1,283 per resident. In fiscal 2010, the state reaped $1,404 per resident, an increase of about 9 percent, not adjusting for inflation.  

Separately, the U.S Census Bureau calculated per-capita state taxes collected until a few years ago. In 2000, the bureau says, state government in Texas collected $1,315 per person, a rate that was the 49th lowest among the states. In 2010, state government collected $1,567 per person; we reached this figure by dividing the bureau’s tabulation of Texas state taxes collected that year, nearly $39.4 billion, by the state’s April 2010 population of 25.1 million.

Another approach: The non-partisan Tax Foundation, based in Washington, annually estimates how much residents of each state cough up for state and local taxes. In 2000, the foundation says, Texans were taxed at an effective rate of 7.1 percent; meaning that many cents of every dollar in income went to state and local taxes. That year, the foundation says, each resident paid about $2,214, on average. In 2009, the latest year checked, Texans paid an effective rate of 7.9 percent; the per-person amount of taxes paid was $3,197--up 44 percent from 2000, though that’s 17 percent adjusted for inflation.

Foundation economist Mark Robyn agreed there doesn’t appear to  have been a doubling in taxes. He added in an interview: ""I’m not saying there’s no possible way you can slice the data to get a doubling... I don’t know if there is a way.""

We sure didn’t find one. The most that Texas taxes might have increased while Perry was governor is 44 percent, which is 17 percent when inflation is weighed.

Maybe Paul’s personal taxes doubled and he can show that’s also Perry’s fault. Paul provided no such evidence.

Generalized, his claim about taxes under Perry is so far off, it’s smokin’. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2011/sep/26/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-our-taxes-doubled-under-rick-perry/

Cain: Jobs recovery worst since the Great Depression
","
Voters want jobs, and Georgia’s own GOP presidential contender Herman Cain wants them to know he has a plan to create them.

Cain pitched the plan, which calls for 9 percent corporate, personal and national sales taxes, during the Sept. 7 presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. It was his central focus during the Tampa, Fla., debate five days later.

And in case anyone didn’t get the point, Cain presented his plan in a Sept. 15 Wall Street Journal op-ed as a foil against President Barack Obama’s recently proposed jobs bill. Cain portrayed himself as a capable business leader, and Obama as an ideologue with little concern for the American worker.

Cain’s evidence was the economy’s performance during Obama’s tenure.

""This is the worst jobs recovery since the Great Depression,"" Cain’s op-ed said.

The worst jobs recovery since the Great Depression? Yes, things are bad. But are they that bad?

We contacted Cain’s spokeswoman for more information, and she recommended we go to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the main federal agency in charge of measuring jobs activity and other economic trends. We did, and found that PolitiFact National’s Truth-O-Meter had been there ahead of us.

In June, our sister site wrote about a jobs claim made by Cain’s Republican primary rival Mitt Romney.

""This is the slowest job recovery since Hoover,"" Romney said on the campaign trail in Tampa, Fla.

PolitiFact National assessed Romney’s history two ways: by the number of jobs created, or changes in the unemployment rate.

The jobs creation measure is a straightforward number.

But unemployment is a little more complicated. The rate is influenced by whether people are looking for a job -- or so discouraged they’ve dropped out of the labor market. A recovery can coax job market dropouts to get back into the hunt. This means it’s not unusual for the unemployment rate to rise as a recovery begins.

Since the Great Recession ended about 23 months before Romney made his statement, PolitiFact National assessed each recession based on the 23-month period after it officially ended.

PolitiFact National used dates from the National Bureau of Economic Research, which is the nation’s unofficial authority on when recessions begin and end. They stopped at World War II, because monthly BLS data doesn’t go further back than that.

Our sister site found Romney’s claim False because, depending on which measure you use, there were either two or four recoveries that were weaker than the current one.

A lot can change in a few months, so we updated those calculations with the newest jobs data.  

Our results were very similar.

Let’s consider job creation. Since the end of the recession in June 2009, the U.S. gained 639,000 jobs. But in two of the 12 recoveries we reviewed, the U.S. actually lost jobs.

From November 2001 to January 2004 under President George W. Bush, the economy lost 481,000 jobs. And from July 1980 to September 1982 under Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, the  U.S. lost 661,000 jobs, according to BLS figures.  

Now for the unemployment rate. Unemployment has decreased by a modest 0.4 percentage points since the end of the most recent recession. But we found three recoveries where unemployment actually rose in the same amount of time.

From November 2001 to January 2004, unemployment crept up by 0.2 percentage points. Between March 1991 and May 1993, under President George H.W. Bush, it rose by 0.3 percentage points. And between July 1980 and September 1982, it jumped by 2.5 percentage points.

This means that as of August, there are either two or three recoveries since the Great Depression that were weaker than the current one, depending on which measure you use. This is very similar to June’s results.  

As we mentioned in our item on Romney, none of this is to suggest we’re in a strong recovery. The data do show that this one is weaker than most. In this regard, Cain does have a point.

But it’s inaccurate for Cain to say, ""This is the worst jobs recovery since the Great Depression."" It’s a weak recovery, but not the worst. We therefore rate Cain’s claim False.",/factchecks/2011/sep/26/herman-cain/cain-jobs-recovery-worst-great-depression/
"['New Jersey', 'Federal Budget', 'Science', 'Rush Holt']","
U.S. Rep. Rush Holt says government support of research and development has fallen by nearly two-thirds since the 1960s
","
Two paths that could affect the future of science are diverging on Capitol Hill, according to U.S. Rep. Rush Holt.

One -- the idea ""that the federal government can play no substantive role in advancing science or technology"" -- the Democratic congressman calls ""grim and pessimistic."" The other --  the idea that recognizes federally funded scientific endeavors can help the economy flourish -- Holt calls ""far more hopeful.""

But, he said, it’s the former that’s taking root in Washington.

""The argument is that the government has been ineffective, that ""investment"" is a codeword for wasteful spending, and that the only way forward is for the government to lower its sights, stop making new investments, and scale back spending,"" Holt, a physicist, wrote in an opinion article posted on NewJerseyNewsroom.com on Sept. 16. ""This view is encapsulated in the recently enacted Budget Control Act of 2011, which demands $2.4 trillion in federal spending cuts. Considering that, as a share of the US economy, the government’s support for research and development (R&D) has fallen by nearly two-thirds since the 1960s, I have little doubt that R&D will bear more than its share of these latest cuts.""

Lawmakers are now wrangling over what funding to slash from the federal budget. As they do, PolitiFact New Jersey checked Holt’s statistic on federal support for research and development.

The rocket scientist is right.

Holt’s staff sent us a chart from a 2007 Congressional Budget Office report that illustrated spending on research and development in the United States as a percentage of gross domestic product, or GDP.

GDP is the value of all goods and services produced within the country; basically, it’s a measure of the nation’s economy.

As a percentage of GDP, federal expenditures for research and development peaked in 1964 at 1.92 percent, according to data from the National Science Foundation. In 2008, the most recent data available on expenditures, the percentage stood at .73 percent. That’s a decrease of 62 percent, or nearly two-thirds.

So, Holt is correct.

But it’s worth noting that overall spending -- including funding from government, industry, universities and nonprofit entities -- on research and development  during that time frame did not see such a significant drop. In 1964, overall funding, as a percent of GDP, was at 2.88 percent. In 2008, it was 2.79 percent, a decrease of 3 percent.

Statistics from the National Science Foundation show the federal government funds 57 percent of basic research. Business, however, foots the bill for the majority of applied research, at nearly 61 percent, and development, at 84 percent, according to 2008 data.  

What do those statistics mean? We reached out to several experts to find out.

The loss of federal support has been cushioned by industry funding, according to Patrick Clemins, director of the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s R&D Budget and Policy Program.

But, he said, ""industry invests in late stage research, things that they can turn a profit on in a relatively short time frame,"" which results in ""less big ideas, but less risk as well.""

Debbie Hart, president of BioNJ, said while industry is looking for both innovation and profit, they are ""furthering their best shots on goal.""

With industry looking to fund projects near the finish line and government support as a percent of the economy dwindling, Hart poses two questions: ""What are we missing? What are the missed opportunities?""

If the decline in federal support for research and development continues, Michael J. Pazzani, vice president for research and economic development at Rutgers University, said we’ll see, ""fewer people pursuing careers in academic research, fewer discoveries.""

Our ruling

Congressman Holt claimed that as a potion of the nation’s economy, government support for research and development has ""fallen by nearly two-thirds since the 1960s.""

Democrats group says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is denying Democrats the right to vote
","
Critics ranging from the AFL-CIO to talk show host Al Sharpton to the Wisconsin Democratic Party have accused Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker of voter suppression efforts.

Perhaps none has been as blunt as the Democratic Governors Association.

In an online ad that encourages readers to sign a petition, the group says flatly: ""Gov. Walker is denying Democrats the right to vote.""

Wisconsin’s Republican governor is stopping Democrats from voting?

Is that even possible?

DGA’s outrage is based on the state’s new photo ID law for voting, which Walker signed in May 2011.

Under the law, nearly all voters -- with exceptions for nursing home residents, military personnel voting absentee and others -- will have to present photo identification beginning with the 2012 presidential primary election. Free ID cards are available from the state.

Voters without a photo ID could cast a provisional ballot that would be counted if they showed photo ID to an election clerk by the Friday after the election.

We rated as True a claim that an early version of the bill was the most restrictive in the nation, primarily because relatively few types of identification would have been allowed for voting. But the final version added more types of IDs and made it easier to cast provisional ballots, something we also looked at in the past.

In any case, the law makes no distinction about voters with any particular party affiliation. The requirements apply to every eligible voter.

We asked DGA spokesman Mark Giangreco for evidence to back the statement in the ad, which he said began running in May 2011 and will continue running indefinitely. He said it’s clear Walker’s actions ""make it more difficult for traditionally Democratic constituencies to cast a ballot.""

But that’s not what the ad says. It says Walker is denying Democrats the right to vote.

The group cited four points as evidence:

Photo ID law discourages voting

The group said the law would discourage traditionally Democratic voters from voting.

DGA cited two news articles about Walker signing the legislation. One quoted Wisconsin Democratic Party chairman Mike Tate as saying the law would have the most impact on ""the elderly, students, shut-ins, African-Americans, Latinos and other groups that tend to vote Democratic,"" from voting. Another said no colleges in the state use IDs that meet the law’s requirements.

DGA also cited a statement by state Sen. Bob Jauch, D-Poplar, that 175,000 state residents over 65 don’t have driver's licenses.

Democrats argue that making voting more difficult through the bill will discourage traditionally Democratic voters from casting a ballot.

It’s certainly true that some residents don’t have driver’s licenses, but free IDs are available; and, since the law was signed, a state agency has made it possible for colleges to add a sticker to student IDs to allow them to be used for voting.

Regardless, adding a requirement that applies across the board does not deny Democrats -- specifically -- the right to vote any more than the requirement that voters be 18 and register to vote.

Passage of law was rushed

The DGA said photo ID was adopted too quickly.

Giangreco cited a quote from Kevin Kennedy, head of the state Government Accountability Board, who said before the law was signed: ""There has been no time for the careful evaluation and vetting needed to ensure the best options for voters and election officials is enacted.""

But that statement says nothing about denying any voting rights.

Lack of photo IDs

DGA said many voters don’t have photo IDs.

The association cited an opinion article by the New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice. It noted a 2006 Brennan report that said 11 percent of voting-age American citizens -- and a greater percentage of African-American, low-income and older citizens -- do not have current and valid government-issued photo IDs. The article also cited other studies, although none was specific to Wisconsin.

That essentially repeats the earlier point about some residents needing to obtain a photo ID. But that’s different than denying someone the right to vote.

Lack of access to photo IDs

The DGA said voters in some Democratic areas of the state would find it more difficult to obtain a photo ID if a plan by Walker to close some state Division of Motor Vehicles offices was adopted.

The association cited a news article published two months after the DGA began running its ad. The article reported that a Democratic state lawmaker said the Walker administration’s plan to close DMV offices in traditionally Democratic areas, while expanding operation hours of DMV offices in Republican districts, seemed to be based on politics.

The administration said closures would be based on economics, but dropped the plan in August 2011.

So, this evidence surfaced after the ad began running and is no longer even on the table.

We see a pattern here.

The DGA’s evidence essentially amounts to a prediction that the photo ID law would cause some voters who tend to back Democrats to stop voting. Giangreco replied by saying: ""I think that the (photo ID) law is tantamount to denying people the right to vote.""

That’s arguable -- and it’s not what is claimed in the ad.

Our conclusion

The Democratic Governors Association said Walker ""is denying Democrats the right to vote.""

It can be argued that Wisconsin’s photo ID law will lead some people who tend to vote for Democrats to stop voting. It’s certainly true that most Wisconsin residents who don’t have a photo ID will have to get one in order to vote.

But words matter. The association goes too far in saying Walker is denying Democrats the right to vote. That is simply not the case.
