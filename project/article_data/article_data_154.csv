A Pennsylvania judge didn't overturn Donald Trump's presidential election
","To hardcore Hillary fans, the headline probably sounds like the only good news they’ve heard since Nov. 8. A website called Today News 24 posted a story earlier this month titled ""Pennsylvania Federal Court grants legal authority to remove Trump after Russian Meddling.""   That’s not a maybe or a possibility in the headline. That’s a definitive statement. But it comes from Today News 24, a site so obscure it doesn’t even show up on the first few pages of a Google search (and should not be mistaken with South African source News 24). On Facebook it has a more significant presence, with over 5,000 likes and about one post every day for the last several weeks. The website for Today News 24 has a dozen or so political-related stories on its homepage and separate sections about trucks and motorbikes that are nearly devoid of content. Most of the headlines have a liberal slant.   So is there any evidence to back up this claim about removing Trump?      For starters, the Today News 24 article is similar to one published on a website called USA Snich  PolitiFact debunked earlier this week. That article claimed ""Putin Interference Could Give Courts Legal Right to Make Hillary President"" and used information from a Huffington Post column written by contributor Alex Mohajer, who is identified as the political director of ""Bros4Hillary"" and a lawyer.    This article uses the same premises put forward by the Huffington Post column — without linking — but takes the possibility a step further by declaring a Pennsylvania court has granted legal authority for the removal of Donald Trump. Like many fake news stories, there are elements of truth combined to create this overblown statement.   An actual case from Pennsylvania in the 1990s, for instance, really did reverse the results of an election. In 1993 in Philadelphia (of course), a winning state Senate candidate was ruled by the courts to have participated in a scheme to drum up hundreds of votes through illegal absentee ballots. This Democratic politician, William Stinson, was removed from office by federal Judge Clarence Newcomer and replaced by the Republican he defeated, Bruce Marks.    The CIA and FBI have also both claimed Russia attempted to sway the electorate toward Trump. But that’s not all this article is saying. No federal court in Pennsylvania has granted ""legal authority"" to remove Trump because of the Russian hacking, as the headline suggests.   The article, written by an author identified as ""darko,"" couches the headline somewhat, saying the 1995 ruling ""could provide legal grounds to remove Donald Trump from office."" But even that action isn’t plausible. PolitiFact interviewed Kermit Roosevelt, a constitutional scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. He said the case involving Stinson and Marks was different than what happened with Russia’s hacking.    ""I’m pretty confident that there’s zero chance of it happening,"" Roosevelt said. ""I could see a court reversing the result of an election if fraud was proved along the lines of, ‘Candidate A really won 150 to 100, but Candidate B fraudulently altered the records to make it look like he won 150 to 100.’ But that’s not what happened. No one credible is alleging that the election was affected by that kind of fraud. The votes recorded were the votes that were cast. They may have been influenced by fake news and Russian propaganda, but there’s no judicial remedy for that."" Our Ruling The website Today News 24 published an article headlined ""Pennsylvania Federal Court grants legal authority to remove Trump after Russian Meddling."" The article uses information highlighted in a Huffington Post article about a judge overturning the results of a 1993 Philadelphia election to show the possibility of Trump being removed in favor of Hillary Clinton. Scholars say the particulars of the 1993 case and this year’s election are not similar.   Plus, the headline doesn’t say it’s a possibility. It says the court has granted authority to remove Trump. No federal court in Pennsylvania has done that. We rule the claim Pants On Fire.",/factchecks/2016/dec/23/today-news-24/pennsylvania-judge-didnt-overturn-donald-trumps-pr/

Fake news blog says Obama bans sending Christmas cards to military
","President Barack Obama has not banned Americans from sending Christmas cards to soldiers stationed overseas, despite claims in a viral post manipulated to resemble a Fox News report. The website tdtalliance.com, whose design crudely mimics Fox News’s website, posted an article Dec. 12 headlined, ""War on Christmas: Obama orders ban on Christmas cards to military."" The article said Obama issued the executive order out of concern that Christmas cards would offend Muslims in the nations where soldiers are deployed. But tdtalliance.com is not affiliated with Fox News. And the article is 100 percent fiction. First of all, a search of all of Obama’s executive orders shows that he never issued an order banning Christmas cards to the military. In fact, the 2016 White House holiday website prompts visitors to send a USO e-card to members of the military. One of the pre-written message options is, ""We are grateful for all you do. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!""   The tdtalliance.com article quotes a Hyman Stratcher, litigation director at the Liberty Institute. The Liberty Institute is a real right-wing advocacy group based in Texas, but Stratcher is a made-up person. (The institute’s real head of litigation is named Hiram Sasser.) The article also quotes Imam Al-Suq Akweer of the Islamic Friendship Coalition, and neither the person nor the organization are real. Finally, the article includes an image that has been edited to look like an on-air Fox News report featuring anchor Martha MacCallum, captioned, ""Obama orders ban on all Christmas cards to overseas servicemen. Pentagon to censor all outgoing mail that appears to be Christmas themed."" While Fox has published numerous stories about the so-called ""War on Christmas,"" they did not run this fabricated story about banning Christmas cards.  Side note: In researching this fact-check, we came across a 2013 Fox article that says a Veterans Administration hospital in Dallas refused to accept cards that say ""Merry Christmas."" However, that article is misleading because it does not explain that a VA chaplain reviews and distributes Christmas cards to veterans who want to receive cards with a religious message.    It’s also worth noting that Tdtalliance.com posted the same article in 2015. Our friends at Snopes debunked it back then, too. This article claiming that Obama issued an executive order that bans sending Christmas cards to overseas soldiers is fake news, designed to deceive.

With 'repeal and replace' in the works, Paul Ryan claims Obamacare is making Medicare go broke
","As U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan discussed the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, a top priority of President-elect Donald Trump, he made a claim about the financial health of Medicare. ""What people don’t realize is, because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke,"" the Wisconsin Republican told Fox News host Bret Baier on Nov. 10, 2016. The Affordable Care Act certainly has its detractors. When Ryan claimed the same month that Obamacare is not a popular law, our rating was Mostly True. The polls generally showed most Americans had an unfavorable opinion of it. But surprisingly for Ryan, who is regarded as a federal budget expert, his claim about the law flies in the face of evidence that it actually helps shore up Medicare. What the ACA did on Medicare https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7de6b429-1d9a-42de-ad08-c7998eaa6ca5 Here’s how Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, lays it out: On one side of the ledger, Obamacare slowed the growth of Medicare spending by, among other things, reducing increases in payments made to nearly all health care providers. On the other side of the ledger, the law included a surtax on high-income earners that brings more money into Medicare. Two health care policy experts further told us that the combination of spending curbs and revenue increases for Medicare Part A -- which covers hospital, nursing home and home care services, and is financed mainly through payroll taxes -- has extended the solvency of Medicare. (Medicare Part B, which is voluntary, covers doctor visits and some medical care.) Paul Ginsburg, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at the University of Southern California, pointed us to an October 2016 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The report noted that in 2010, the Medicare trustees projected that Obamacare’s spending curbs and revenue increases would mean Medicare’s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which finances Part A, would remain solvent until 2029. That’s 12 years later than had been projected a year before the Affordable Care Act became law. (The projection has since been revised to 2028.) Michael Sparer, a professor health policy and management at Columbia University in New York, put it this way, financially speaking: If Obamacare were repealed completely, ""it would put Medicare in worse shape, not better shape."" Finally, it’s worth noting that both Factcheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker also concluded that Ryan’s claim is wrong. They both also noted that, even if the Part A trust fund did become depleted in 2028, the program wouldn’t be broke, in that it is still set up to cover an estimated 87 percent of expenses. FactCheck.org’s rating was false and the Fact Checker gave Ryan its worst rating, four Pinnocchios, which is for statements deemed to be ""whoppers."" Ryan’s office opted not to provide us any information to support his claim. Our rating Ryan said: ""Because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke."" Financially, Medicare isn’t entirely in the clear, given that actuaries project that a key reserve fund will run out of money in 2028. But the Medicare trustees themselves, along with a host of experts, say the Affordable Care Act’s changes to Medicare -- including holding the line on spending and raising taxes -- actually puts Medicare in better shape than before the law was adopted. That’s a long way from making Medicare go broke. We rate Ryan’s statement Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2016/dec/23/paul-ryan/repeal-and-replace-works-paul-ryan-says-obamacare-/
"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'New York', 'Michael Long']","
No evidence businesses have moved because of wage increase
","New York State’s minimum wage has been climbing above the federal wage requirement since 2013. The state’s increases were supposed to stop when the minimum wage hit $9 an hour last year. But then Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo struck a deal with state lawmakers in March to raise it to $15 an hour over the next several years. The higher minimum wage is bad for businesses, which already struggle with taxes and regulations, said New York State Conservative Party Chairman Michael R. Long. The state is ""already showing signs of various companies picking up and leaving,"" Long said. When asked about his claim, Long said he was not referring to any particular company. ""All someone needs to do is look at upstate,"" Long said. So is Long right? Are some businesses leaving New York because of the higher minimum wage? What’s the minimum wage? The state’s hourly minimum wage has risen from $7.25 - still the federal level - to $9 since 2013. Tipped workers, like those in the restaurant and hospitality industries, also saw a minimum wage increase in the last year. They used to make around $5 an hour without tips. They are now paid $6.80 to $7.65, depending on the industry and tips earned. Starting at the end of this year, a new set of minimum wage increases will be phased in across the state. • New York City will reach $15 by the end of 2018. Small businesses in New York City have until the end of 2019. • Westchester County and Long Island will reach $15 an hour in  2021. • Upstate New York will reach $12.50 by the end of 2020. The Department of Labor will then determine the wage increase each year until the region hits $15. Wages for tipped workers will increase at a different rate. Starting in 2019, the governor can pause the increase if it appears to cause more harm than good.  Companies moving out of New York When we spoke to Long about his claim, he said he did not have any particular company in mind. We also reached out to business groups, including two chambers of commerce across the state's southern border, to see if they knew of any business that had moved or plan to move because of the state's rising minimum wage. They were able to provide examples of businesses that closed, but could not point to a company that moved out of state because of the wage increase. We also could not find any reports of businesses relocating because of the wage increase. Some suggested minimum wage was a factor in Verizon's decision to relocate jobs from two call centers in New York, but a representative from Verizon said the state's wage was not a factor in the move. Impact on business We found a handful of small business owners who said that minimum wage increases – or the prospect of more increases – were a factor in the failure of their businesses. There is no way to prove that, but restaurants and other small business often operate with little margin for error. Anything that increases costs – higher rents, more expensive food or other costs, higher wages – can hurt their businesses. Bob and Ron’s Fish Fry in Albany County closed in April after the new wage increase became law. The restaurant posted on its Facebook page that rising costs sunk it. ""Mainly the economy, high cost of seafood, demand,"" the business wrote in a post on the social media site, ""And to be honest there is no way we could pay the high minimum wage that is coming and mandatory 3 months paid sick leave- this state is going in the wrong direction for small businesses- that's the main reasons."" When the Del Rio Diner in Brooklyn closed in July, it also cited the higher wage. ""The minimum wage, that’s what broke the camel’s back. It killed us,"" Larry Georgeton, the diner’s co-owner, told Brooklyn Daily. Not only restaurants complained. A family-owned Ramada Hotel in Buffalo closed in July. The owner told The Buffalo News that higher wages and stricter regulations influenced their decision. ""It has been difficult to compete with all the new properties being built in Western New York, along with all the new proposed increases in wages and state regulations,"" Richard A. DiVita Jr., the hotel’s chief operating officer, told the newspaper. The owner of a restaurant that closed in East Aurora after 14 years of business also placed blame on the state’s rising minimum wage. The businesses also faced challenges outside of the minimum wage including the cost of resources and more competition. Our ruling Long, the state’s Conservative Party chairman, said New York State is ""already showing signs of various companies picking up and leaving"" because of the new minimum-wage legislation. We found a handful of businesses that cited the higher minimum wage as a factor for closing. But we couldn't find any companies that relocated out of New York State because of the wage increase.  We rate this claim as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/dec/23/michael-long/business-new-york-have-closed-because-minimum-wage/

False: Greg Abbott's claim that arms treaty could give U.N. authority to police guns
","Greg Abbott warned in a December 2016 tweet that President Barack Obama seeks Senate ratification of a treaty that could empower the United Nations to regulate guns. The prospect of the U.N. mucking with American guns should sound familiar. That’s because the treaty has long sparked similar claims--many of them short on facts. Abbott's tweet, Republican concerns The Texas governor tweeted: ""This Treaty by Obama could give the UN some authority to regulate guns. Tell the Senate to reject it."" Abbott further pointed to a Guns.com story stating, in part, that the Arms Trade Treaty, recently urged on the Senate by the lame-duck Democratic president, seeks to regulate the world’s annual exchange of $70 billion in conventional weaponry including tanks, helicopters and missiles. That Dec. 13, 2016 story doesn’t say the U.N. deal would regulate guns within the U.S. Still, it notes opposition from Republicans including Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, who signed legislation in April 2016 prohibiting the enforcement of international laws, such as the treaty, ""that could affect the Second Amendment,"" Guns.com says. The Democratic-led Senate signaled its concerns in 2013, voting by a 53-46 margin against the U.S. going along with any such treaty. That move occurred a month before the U.N. General Assembly approved the treaty with 154 nations in favor, 3 opposed and 23 absent. The U.S. voted for it; North Korea, Iran and Syria opposed it. The 2016 Guns.com story also recaps that when Abbott was attorney general of Texas, he ""promised to slap the federal government with a lawsuit if the treaty was ratified."" On Sept. 25, 2013, Guns.com then reported, AG Abbott said in a press release: ""By signing this treaty, the Obama administration has attempted to subject Americans’ right to bear arms to the oversight of the United Nations."" Abbott said in an April 2013 Fox News interview: ""The concern is that the United States is trying to use the United Nations as a back-door mechanism to try to legislate here in the United States, in this instance trying to impose gun control."" In that interview, Abbott was pressed to elaborate on the treaty’s threat to domestic gun rights. He then conceded the treaty focuses on international trade in armaments. Still, he expressed concern the U.N. would exploit the treaty to impose gun registration and other requirements. Past fact checks We’ve spotted flawed claims about the treaty before. In May 2012, we found Pants on Fire a Texas candidate’s statement that the treaty--then still under negotiation--would ban the use of firearms. In an April 2012 speech, Thomas Countryman, an assistant secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, said any treaty provisions limiting domestic gun rights would not be embraced. ""We will not support outcomes that would in any way infringe on the Second Amendment,"" Countryman said. Later, we rated False a Texas claim that the U.N.-advanced treaty mandated an international guns registry. Nations that ratify the treaty must track conventional arms that move across their borders, share information about the transfers with the U.N. and other countries and then annually report the imports and exports in broad categories such as ""battle tanks"" to the U.N. Treaty rests on self-regulation So what does the treaty do? The treaty states its purpose is to ""establish the highest possible common international standards for regulating or improving the regulation of the international trade in conventional arms"" and to ""prevent and eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms and prevent their diversion."" It requires each participating country to establish its own controls over the export of ammunition and conventional arms. The pact prohibits sending the weapons to nations that are under a U.N. arms embargo or where the arms will be used for terrorism, genocide, crimes against humanity, breaches of the Geneva Conventions, attacks against civilians or other war crimes. The treaty calls on participating nations to take ""appropriate measures"" if they determine that a shipment has been diverted, although it does not clearly define those steps. The accord applies to tanks, armored combat vehicles, artillery, combat aircraft and helicopters, warships, missiles, missile launchers and small arms such and handguns and rifles. Participating nations would be required to send annual reports to the U.N. on their imports and exports of conventional weapons. The treaty gives no body including the U.N. any enforcement power, but supporters have expressed hope it will create common standards among countries for international trade of weapons. To go into effect, the pact must be ratified by the governments of 50 U.N. nations. As of mid-December 2016, it had been accepted or ratified by 91 countries including France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Spain, Australia and Mexico. The State Department has said the treaty, if joined by the U.S., would not put additional controls on the import or export of guns in America. Instead, it would require other countries to establish ""control systems that are closer to the high standard the United States already sets with its own national standards,"" the State Department wrote in a September 2013 fact sheet. Also, the pact’s preamble affirms ""the sovereign right of any State to regulate and control conventional arms exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system."" We called and emailed Abbott so he could otherwise offer backup for his regulation claim and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Abbott said the treaty advocated by Obama ""could give the U.N. some authority to regulate guns."" This statement, which fits with other incorrect claims about the U.N. gaining the power to preempt U.S. gun laws, doesn't hold up because the treaty doesn’t regulate gun traffic within countries and also doesn’t hand the U.N. enforcement powers.

News-entertainment service incorrectly says Texas killed Medicaid program 'emboldened' by 2016 elex
","In case you missed it, Texas Republicans followed on Donald Trump’s election by wiping out aid to needy children. Except, we confirmed, that's not so. A news-entertainment website, IfYouOnlyNews.com, topped a Dec. 4, 2016, post, later pointed out to us by Facebook, with this headline: ""Emboldened by election, Texas Republicans kill Medicaid funding for kids with disabilities."" The next day, a debunker for Snopes.com said Republicans had cut some Medicaid funding, but they didn’t do so because they were emboldened by the 2016 general election. And when we emailed IfYouOnlyNews.com inquiring into the basis of its post, especially the headline, we didn’t hear back. Best we could tell, meantime, the site’s story didn’t back up its headline, instead piling on nonfactual wood: ""In an all-out assault on the social safety net, Texas Republicans have seized the opportunity to finalize and enact a series of brutal budget cuts."" Otherwise, the story drew on a Nov. 28, 2016, Texas news story quoting Carrie Williams, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, saying the agency would launch the legislated cuts in Medicaid rates starting Dec. 15, 2016, which was several months after the Texas Supreme Court agreed with an appeals court by declining to take up a challenge to the reductions. Plaintiffs had argued the cuts were so steep that providers would have to close their businesses and forgo seeing as many as 60,000 children. Not in the IfYouOnlyNews.com report: Williams further telling the Texas Tribune, ""We will monitor the reduction of rates to ensure access to care is not impacted and that Texans around the state receive the much-needed therapies required to improve their lives."" To our inquiry, Williams pointed out Rider 50, at the bottom of page II-99 of the 2016-17 state budget, which was passed into law in 2015. The rider directs the commission to reform ""reimbursement methodology to be in line with industry standards, policies, and utilization for acute care therapy services while considering stakeholder input and access to care."" The rider goes on to say that in each of the fiscal years through August 2017, the agency should achieve at least $50 million in state savings ""through rate reductions"" plus another $25 million a year through policy changes. But, the rider says, additional rate cuts should be imposed to the degree policy-related savings fall short. Overall, the budget builds in $373 million in reductions in state spending on Medicaid through the two years. For the fiscal year through August 2017, $26 billion in state money was budgeted for Medicaid. Williams also guided us to legislative records showing House and Senate votes on the budget; these show that a few Democrats joined ruling Republicans in voting for the final version of the budget -- including the fee-cut language. News organizations have widely tracked the results of the directive to reduce Medicaid payments to certain in-home child therapists. Those accounts show that no Medicaid funding was entirely killed and also that the reductions put in motion couldn’t have been connected to the November 2016 election results without time-machine trickery. An April 2016 Austin American-Statesman news story quoted state Sen. Jane Nelson, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, saying lawmakers made the reductions based on information showing Texas’ rates had considerably exceeded Medicaid reimbursement rates in other states, a point disputed by some. Nelson, R-Flower Mound, said in 2016: ""Forcing Texas taxpayers to accept billing rates that are in some cases double the rates in other states would be a terrible precedent. These are rate adjustments, not reductions in services, and the (budget) rider clearly directs the agency to preserve access to care as we bring these rates to an appropriate level."" To our inquiry, Bill Noble, spokesman for the Texas Association for Home Care and Hospice, which opposed the fee reductions, reminded us by email that advocates for providers vigorously challenged the quality of the research behind the fee reductions. An August 2015 American-Statesman news story quoted Jenny Jones, vice president for governmental and public affairs at the Texas A&M Health Science Center, saying she didn’t know if fee data collected by A&M researchers showed Texas therapists were overpaid compared to peers elsewhere; that was the state commission’s interpretation, Jones said. Noble also emailed us a brief association critique of the research stating, in part, that researchers erred by comparing Texas rates for certain services with rates in other states for other services. Debate persists. For instance, Joe Straus, the Republican House speaker, said shortly before IfYouOnlyNews.com posted its story that he expects the House in 2017 to reverse the fee cuts. In a Tribune interview, Straus said the cuts were ""well intentioned"" but that ""maybe they were a mistake."" Around the same time, the Texas Conservative Coalition Research Institute, which advises conservative House members, updated its report stating that a reversal of the fee cuts ""may not be prudent"" given an ""overabundance"" of therapy providers in the state. Our ruling IfYouOnlyNews.com said: ""Emboldened by election, Texas Republicans kill Medicaid funding for kids with disabilities."" Cuts sure happened. But this headline claim, not backed up by the accompanying story, fumbles facts. Specifically, the Republican-majority 2015 Legislature requested fee reductions for specific services to certain children with disabilities--not killing all such Medicaid funding. Also, that action occurred more than 17 months before the November 2016 election. We find this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

Website hypes long-shot theory about courts replacing Donald Trump with Hillary Clinton
","A widely shared post from a little-known website suggests that Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election could lead the courts to install Hillary Clinton as president. ""Breaking: Putin Interference Could Give Courts Legal Right to Make Hillary President,"" says a Dec. 11, 2016, post on USA Snich, a website so obscure that Googling ""USA Snich"" only brings up references to the Harry Potter game of quidditch (though it uses a ""snitch"") or articles about prison snitching. Yet the post got enough interest by social media users that it popped up in the list of questionable articles Facebook is sharing with PolitiFact and other fact-checkers. (The USA Snich post is actually a nearly verbatim reprint of one from the site SupremePatriot.com.) One reason for the wide sharing may be that the post hit a social media sweet spot: What it advertises would simultaneously outrage conservatives and give liberals hope. As it happens, the USA Snich post frames it in a way favorable to conservatives, calling the notion advanced in the headline ""scary"" and concluding, ""What a bunch of BS. This will never happen! #NEVERHILLARY."" However, posts with a similar message as this headline also appeared on liberal sites, such as Occupy Democrats. So what’s going on with the USA Snich post? Let’s take a closer look. A legal precedent? The post links to an article published on the Huffington Post. It was written by a contributor -- not a Huffington Post staff member -- named Alex Mohajer, who is identified as ""political director of Bros4Hillary, a volunteer advocacy organization"" and the holder of a law degree. In the column, Mohajer writes that recent allegations of Russian-linked hacking could provide a basis for the federal courts to get involved with the election’s outcome, through a case that’s little known even among constitutional scholars. ""At least one federal court decision suggests there may be some federal case law on the question of whether it is possible to invalidate the outcome of an election after the fact when there is fraud, and replace a candidate benefitted by fraud with his opponent,"" he wrote. ""The case, Marks v. Stinson, is the first and only known case in which a federal judge reversed an election outcome."" The 1995 case revolved around allegations that Democrat William G. Stinson colluded with election officials to cast illegally obtained absentee ballots. In February 1994, after Stinson had taken office, the federal judge ordered him removed and replaced by his opponent, Republican Bruce Marks. An appellate court affirmed the district court’s intervention in the matter, but it objected to the court seating Marks, although because Marks was already serving, the court allowed him to continue for the remainder of the term. Here’s the money paragraph: The case offers an ""interesting rationale that could theoretically be applied in part if, after Donald Trump assumes office, it is shown that Russian hacking (or any fraud, for that matter) robbed Hillary Clinton of the presidency,"" Mohajer writes. ""The case offers clues that imply courts may intervene."" This is a novel legal theory. We asked Kermit Roosevelt, a constitutional scholar at the University of Pennsylvania, what he thought of it. ""I'm pretty confident that there's zero chance of it happening,"" Roosevelt said. ""I could see a court reversing the result of an election if fraud was proved along the lines of, ‘Candidate A really won 150 to 100, but Candidate B fraudulently altered the records to make it look like he won 150 to 100.’ But that's not what happened. No one credible is alleging that the election was affected by that kind of fraud. The votes recorded were the votes that were cast. They may have been influenced by fake news and Russian propaganda, but there's no judicial remedy for that."" The USA Snich post In other words, the theory offered in the headline is, at most, the longest of longshots. So right off the bat, the headline elevates the urgency of a legal theory of uncertain value that had been advanced by one Clinton supporter. The USA Snich post (and the SupremePatriot post) also leave out a lot of cautionary words that Mohajer himself had inserted in his original column. While USA Snich did link to the Huffington Post column and reposted several paragraphs of what Mohajer wrote, none of the paragraphs reprinted actually addresses the legal theory underpinning the headline’s claim that the courts could overturn the election. To find that, a reader would have to click the Huffington Post link, something many readers presumably won’t make the effort to do. Mohajer’s column acknowledges some significant questions about the theory. ""Obviously both the stakes and the office in question are much higher than in Marks v. Stinson,"" he wrote. ""There has been no case of first impression with regards to the presidency being overturned to a wrongful winner’s opponent. There is also, of course, no constitutional Electoral College process or system in Pennsylvania, so the situations are not exactly analogous. … It is not clear how the case would impact a presidential election."" When we reached out to Mohajer, he said that being a law school graduate, he thought of the piece as ""an academic exercise."" ""I thought it was an interesting case on election fraud and the only federal court ruling I could find that had a judge replacing an elected official with their opponent from the election because of fraud,"" Mohajer told PolitiFact. ""It would require courts use a liberal interpretation of the word ‘fraud’ and would probably require some wrongdoing by Trump."" In the interview, Mohajer acknowledged that the likelihood of this scenario occurring is ""next to lightning striking the same person twice."" ""Ultimately, is it plausible? Of course not,"" he said. ""But If you had asked me 12 months ago whether I thought Donald Trump would elected president, I would have answered in kind with the exact same certainty."" Our ruling USA Snich posted an item headlined, ""Putin Interference Could Give Courts Legal Right to Make Hillary President.""

Fake news site says Sarah Palin to boycott Mall of America over black Santa
","This Christmas season, Minnesota’s Mall of America hired its first black Santa Claus. An article on fake news website Politicono.com got that fact right but nothing else. The Dec. 3 article carried the headline, ""Sarah Palin Calls To Boycott Mall Of America Because ‘Santa Was Always White In The Bible.’"" The article quoted Palin as saying people should run the Mall of America ""into the ground,"" on the basis of Santa ""always having been white in the Bible,"" and, ""No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,"" The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate never said these things. Politicono.com, which calls itself a ""hybrid news/satire platform,"" takes real news hooks and builds fake stories on top of them. Every article has a ""show facts"" button to illuminate which parts of the story are real and those that are fabricated. When you click the ""show facts"" button on the Palin article, it highlights as fact the first paragraph, which is about the Mall of America’s real decision to hire a black Santa. But the entire rest of the article, detailing Palin’s supposed call to boycott the mall because of the Bible’s teachings on Santa, is completely made up. ""Dear Democrats, this is what ‘fake news’ actually looks like, and I guarantee you no Trump voter actually fell for this,"" Palin wrote on Facebook Dec. 20, with a link to a Breitbart article debunking the Politicono.com post. Politicano.com is more forthcoming than other fake news sites about the fact that it posts made-up content. But it’s still not immediately apparent that its editors fabricated the story claiming Palin said she would boycott the Mall of America because Santa was always white in the Bible.

Price mostly correct on budget bills
","Before Georgia Rep. Tom Price of Roswell in metro Atlanta, was nominated for a position in Donald Trump’s cabinet, he was in charge of the House Budget Committee. The physician-turned-congressman has been an outspoken critic of Obamacare -- and Washington gridlock. Price will continue to be the chairman until he is confirmed for a Cabinet position by the Senate. At a recent event in Washington D.C. at the Brookings Institution, Trump’s pick for Secretary of Health and Human Services spoke on the effectiveness, or lack thereof, of the annual government funding process. Price said, ""In the last five years only one out of 60 -- one out of 60 -- appropriations bills has been passed on time before the end of the fiscal year."" Congress often passes spending bills belatedly. But we wondered, do so few really get passed on time? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look. Background For some background, we looked to who is responsible for what when it comes to the budget. The Budget Committee, which Price has chaired since 2015 after taking over from now-Speaker Paul Ryan, is made up of five members from the Committee on Ways and Means, five members from the Committee on Appropriations, and one member from the Committee on Rules. The committee is responsible for developing the annual budget resolution, which is what kicks off the budget process by setting the top line number for appropriations. Basically, it sets the ceiling for how much money the 12 annual appropriations bills can collectively spend. Appropriations bills start in the House. Both the House and Senate come up with their own versions of the bills. The chambers can pass bills individually, and regularly do, but the bills must match before being sent to the president. To start the process, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees take the top line number set by the budget committee, divvy it among the 12 bills and then write bills to those numbers. For the last several years, Congress has been prone to passing continuing resolutions that extend pre-existing appropriations, and omnibus spending bills that pack many smaller, regular appropriations bills into one, instead of new, individual bills each fiscal year. Additionally, only one-third of federal spending is done through annual appropriations bills approved by Congress. The other two-thirds is mandatory spending on entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare. But mandatory spending appropriations aren’t permanent -- Congress can make changes in the law that alter spending within mandatory programs. One lone bill We found that this bill, the lone appropriations bill passed before the end of the fiscal year that Price speaks of, does, in fact, stand alone. We reached out to Price’s spokesperson Ryan Murphy. He sent us a compilation of background information by some federal sources. Earlier this year, Congress passed an appropriations bill on military construction, which was signed into law by President Obama on Sept. 29, two days before the start of the 2017 fiscal year. According to a number of bills listed on Congress.gov, the military construction bill passed in September is the only full, line-by-line appropriations bill that has been enacted before Oct. 1 in the last five years. (Although continuing resolutions are technically appropriations bills and pass before the Oct. 1 deadline, this is the only full appropriations bill with new funding that was passed.) But some of the issue with Price’s statement comes from his choice of words. The House and Senate pass bills, but those versions must be reconciled and passed again before they can be enacted after being signed into law by the president. The Senate website says, ""Once legislation has passed both chambers of Congress in identical form, been signed into law by the president, become law without his signature, or passed over his veto, the legislation is enacted."" Our ruling Health secretary nominee Tom Price said, ""In the last five years only one out of 60 -- one out of 60 -- appropriations bills has been passed on time before the end of the fiscal year."" And that’s basically true. Congress has turned to omnibus spending bills and continuing resolutions to fund the government for the last couple of years, which differ from full appropriations bills. However, in the last five years, appropriations bills were passed by individual chambers before the end of the fiscal year, they just weren’t matched by the other chamber or reconciled. Even then, all but one was signed into law by the president (and enacted) after Oct. 1. We rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/dec/21/tom-price/price-mostly-correct-budget-bills/

Approaching retirement, half of workers 55-64 have 'zero' money 'in the bank,' Bernie Sanders says
","At a post-election town hall meeting in Kenosha, Wis., 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders opined on why Republican Donald Trump is headed for the Oval Office and not the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. ""One of the arguments as to why Trump won is the belief that most of – or many of -- his supporters are sexist or are racist or are homophobes. I happen not to believe that`s the case,"" Sanders said at the Dec. 12, 2016 meeting, which was broadcast on MSNBC. ""I think what he did do is, he said, ‘You know what, there is a lot of pain in this country; people are scared and people are worried.’ One example: Right now, 50 percent of older workers, 55 to 64 -- you know how much money they have in the bank, as they enter retirement? Who wants to guess? ""Zero!"" the Vermont senator exclaimed. ""What do you think? People are scared to death of retirement."" On another haves and have-nots claim -- that ""the top one-tenth of 1 percent"" of Americans ""own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent"" -- we gave Sanders a Mostly True. But, are half of Americans approaching retirement with nothing in the bank? Sanders’ evidence To support Sanders’ statement, his campaign cited a May 2015 report on the financial status of retirees and workers approaching retirement from a gold-standard source, the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office. Sanders had requested it in his role as ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security. The report used data from the latest triennial Survey of Consumer Finances done by the  Federal Reserve Board, in 2013. It is the premier survey of wealth in the United States, according to Wellesley College economics professor Courtney Coile, who is the associate director of the Retirement Research Center at the National Bureau of Economic Research. The GAO found that 52 percent of households age 55 and over have no money in what the report defined as retirement savings -- an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) or a defined-contribution plan, such as a 401(k). But that group includes people who are well into retirement. The situation is somewhat less dire for the group that Sanders cited at the town hall, those ages 55 to 64. The report found that 41 percent of the people in that group have no money in defined-contribution plans or IRAs. There’s another point of clarification, however. The report did not consider in that statistic other savings that the 55 to 64 age group have. The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College ran those numbers for us, using the same Federal Reserve survey data, although it expressed the statistic a little differently. The center found that 38.5 percent of Americans ages 55 to 64 do not have a retirement account such as an IRA, traditional pension or 401(k), but nevertheless have some savings. With that group, the median amount of their savings is $1,000 -- in other words, half of them have savings of more than $1,000 and half have less. So, it’s not as though those people have ""zero"" in the bank, although many don’t have savings that would last them very long in retirement. Our rating Sanders said 50 percent of workers ages 55 to 64 have ""zero"" money ""in the bank as they enter retirement."" His claim is somewhat high, but doesn’t give a misleading impression. A widely respected government report says 41 percent of Americans 55 to 64 have no savings in common retirement accounts such as an IRA or a 401(k). It’s also worth noting that some in that group have other savings not in retirement accounts, though for many of them it’s less than $1,000. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.",/factchecks/2016/dec/21/bernie-sanders/approaching-retirement-half-workers-55-64-have-zer/

Getting a NYC municipal ID is not easier than getting a Costco membership
","It takes a membership card to shop at a Costco warehouse store. There are 87.3 million Costco cardholders around the world - some of whom shop at the company’s New York City locations. Municipal identification cards are also common in the wallets of New York City residents. The New York City identification card gives them access to city programs and services and helps when it comes to renting an apartment, opening a bank account or complying with a police officer who asks for identification.   So which card is harder to get? State Assemblyman Ron Castorina Jr., R-Staten Island, called the vetting process for a New York City ID card weak with ""little to no integrity."" ""It is more difficult to obtain a Costco membership than it is to get a NYC Municipal ID,"" Castorina said in a press release. Castorina is one of two state lawmakers who filed a lawsuit to preserve supporting documents submitted to get New York City IDs. When New York City lawmakers created the municipal ID program last year, the statute allowed the city to destroy documents that could identify applicants. The aim was to protect undocumented immigrants from federal immigration authorities. Until now, the city has stored the information. But city officials say starting next year, ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald J. Trump, they will no longer hold on to documents submitted by applicants. Castorina and Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, also a Republican from Staten Island, want the city to hold onto the documents because they may help law enforcement agencies in any investigations. So is Castorina right? Is it easier to get a Costco membership? To find out, we went through the application process. Signing up for Costco You can apply for membership online or in any of the company’s 723 warehouse stores around the world. We chose to apply online. The application requires your name, address, date of birth, email address and phone number. Members can share their membership with others in their households, but have to provide their name, dates of birth, and contact information as well. The online form takes less than five minutes to complete. After completing the form, applicants enter their credit card information to purchase the membership online. Membership options range from $55 to $110. Members pay to renew the membership each year. Once the payment is accepted, Costco sends an email with a membership number. This can take from 10 minutes to 24 hours, a company customer service representative said. After receiving the email, the customer copies the membership number down and brings it along on the first visit to the Costco store. Customers must bring a photo ID on their initial visit. Otherwise, the store will not hand over the membership card. Customers who opt for the business membership also have to bring either a business license or three pieces of business ID, which can include anything from a business card to an electric bill. Customers do not have to provide a proof of residency.  The store’s customer service line says customers can complete the entire process in less than one day. Signing up for a New York City ID For a New York City ID, residents can either print out an application or fill one out at an enrollment center. Every borough has at least one center, and some have more. The one-page application asks for the resident’s name, address, date of birth, gender, eye color, height, and contact information. There’s also an option to register as an organ donor, select a preferred language, and designate an emergency contact. The form takes less than 10 minutes to complete. Applicants then must schedule an appointment at one of the enrollment centers. Most centers are not open every day, and at least one has appointments booked through the end of January according to the scheduling website. Residents can also call the city’s government 311 helpline to schedule an appointment. Residents have to submit up to four identifying documents with their application. One of the documents has to have a photo, one has to show the applicant’s date of birth, and one has to show the applicant lives in New York City. A representative from the city’s 311 helpline said a few forms of ID, like one from the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles, are enough to prove residency and identity. Homeless people or survivors of domestic violence who do not have a permanent address have to bring a letter from either the shelter where they are staying or from a city agency, nonprofit organization, religious institution, hospital, or health clinic. If the application is approved at the center, the staff will take the resident’s photo for the ID. If they have an address, they will get it in the mail less than two weeks later. If they don’t have an address, the ID will be sent to the enrollment center where they applied. Our ruling Castorina, the assemblyman from Staten Island, claimed in a press release that ""it is more difficult to obtain a Costco membership than it is to get a NYC Municipal ID."" Getting a membership at Costco requires an application and a photo ID on your first visit to the store. A municipal ID in New York City requires more documentation and takes longer to process. The only obstacle to getting a Costco membership that might make it more difficult for some people is the cost. The New York City ID card is free. A Costco membership starts at $55 annually.

Website makes up story that Mike Pence called Michelle Obama vulgar
","Vice President-elect Mike Pence attacked First Lady Michelle Obama as the most distasteful woman to ever live in the White House — at least according to a fake news story on a website that bills itself as satirical. A headline on an Oct. 14, 2016, story on Politicono.com declared ""Pence: ‘Michelle Obama Is The Most Vulgar First Lady We’ve Ever Had’."" Users flagged the suspicious post as part of Facebook’s attempt to stop the spread of fake news. The story was pegged to a real instance of Pence defending Donald Trump, who was then the GOP presidential candidate running against Hillary Clinton. Michelle Obama had said in a speech on Oct. 13, without mentioning Trump by name, that a 2005 recording had shown the GOP nominee admitting to ""sexually predatory behavior."" Pence appeared on CBS This Morning on Oct. 14 and sounded puzzled by Michelle Obama’s comments. ""Look I have a lot of respect for the first lady,"" he said. ""But I don’t understand the basis of her claim."" But that’s about as far as Pence’s comments went. He never called Obama vulgar, and certainly not the most vulgar first lady ever. That’s because Politicono.com is a website (its slogan is ""Just Enough News"") that takes a kernel of real news and sprouts an entire fabricated story around it. It says readers come to the site to read ""a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire."" Indeed, at the top of the Pence story are two buttons: ""Show facts"" and ""hide facts."" Clicking the ""show facts"" button highlights only the first paragraph of the story. The rest is entirely made up. Politicono.com didn’t respond to our requests for comment, but when we talked to them for another fact-check in 2015, an administrator pointed out they admit some content is exaggerated. That makes the website less culpable than many others that give no indication something may be contrived, but it’s still not immediately apparent the story is fake.

Anti-vaccination blog revives debunked HPV story
","The post on an anti-vaccination website was damning. The headline ""Bill Gates uses 30,000 Indian girls as guinea pigs to test cancer vaccine,"" appeared on the Organic & Healthy blog in October and is still being shared. The article described a 2009 human papillomavirus vaccination demonstration project in India. In the span of about a year, thousands of girls between the ages of 10 and 14 received one of two vaccines to prevent genital warts that are linked to cancer later in life. According to the blog, the project went terribly wrong. In one Indian state, ""some of the girls’ health deteriorated and five of them died the next year,"" the article said. In a second state, ""two deaths were reported."" One of our readers saw the blog post and asked us to check it out. We did and as with many false claims, it takes a thread of fact and weaves a blanket of misinformation. We specifically looked at whether the vaccinations led to any deaths. First, a little background on human papillomavirus, or HPV. HPV causes genital warts and cervical precancers that can lead to a variety of cancers. In the United States for example, HPV is responsible for over 30,000 cancers each year. Several vaccines to prevent the warts and precancers came on the market in 2006. Since then, about 200 million doses have been administered worldwide. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for the most common virus strains, the vaccines ""provide close to 100 percent protection against cervical precancers and genital warts."" So, what happened in India? In 2007, the Indian government’s Council of Medical Research and two state governments laid the groundwork for a project to see whether these vaccines could be delivered cost-effectively in lower income communities. An international nonprofit PATH was directly responsible for the work. The vaccinations began in 2009 and by March 2010, they had vaccinated about 24,000 girls between the ages of 10 and 14. The effort was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and in addition to India, it took place in Peru, Uganda and Vietnam. The trouble began when local newspapers reported several deaths linked to the vaccinations. In October 2009, a coalition of community organizations and health activists called for a halt to the project. Their cries grew more insistent. In an April 2007 letter to the Minister of Health, in addition to the deaths, they said over 120 girls had suffered everything from mood swings to epileptic seizures. The government agreed to stop. No deaths The government commissioned a group of physicians and researchers to investigate whether the vaccination program caused any deaths. In February 2011, the group reported there was no connection. One girl drowned. Insecticide poisoning killed two others. Two others had severe malaria. One was bitten by a poisonous snake and one died from a disease that physicians said ""can not be linked possibly to HPV."" No reputable study has ever tied the vaccine to a death. The vaccines can have side effects, including fever, headache, fainting and nausea. But according to many studies cited by the CDC, these pass quickly. Not guinea pigs The article paints a picture of global pharmaceutical companies experimenting on unsuspecting young, poor girls. In fact, the vaccines have gone through years of testing and have become commonplace in the wealthiest nations. Australia provides it to every girl and boy between 12 and 13 years old in public school. Vaccinations are routine in France, Germany and Holland. The vaccines are on the market in over 100 countries and the World Health Organization recommends it as part of the national immunization program for any nation that can afford it. A problem of process A 2010 article in the British medical journal Lancet assessed what went wrong in India. Its basic conclusion? Officials were too slow to respond when local concerns first emerged. ""Reluctance by public health authorities to respond to issues of public distrust for fear that they will exacerbate the problem is dangerous,"" the authors wrote. The repercussions lasted for some time. In 2013, an Indian parliamentary panel chastised PATH, the international nonprofit, along with its Indian partners for failing to fully inform the parents of the girls of what they were doing and not having a system in place to track any side effects. Our ruling An anti-vaccination blog tied Bill Gates to the deaths of several girls who were part of an HPV vaccination roll out in India. A full medical investigation determined that the girls died from causes completely unrelated to the vaccine. Some were poisoned by insecticide, malaria took others, and one drowned. Many millions of young girls and boys have received the vaccine over the years and while there are some common side effects, they are mild. The blog post is a mash-up of outdated rumors that were disproven years ago. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

Rep. Matt Wingard says price of certain beverages could double under increased bottle deposits
","
Last week the Oregon House approved an expansion of the state’s bottle bill law, adding single-serve coffees, energy drinks, teas, and sports drinks to the list of beverages that now require a nickel return deposit. Furthermore, House Bill 3145 calls for that nickel to increase to 10 cents if the redemption rate falls below 80 percent for two years in a row.

Rep. Matt Wingard, R-Wilsonville, was among a dozen legislators in the House to vote against the bill. He thinks it’s a great idea, really, but he doesn’t like the possibility of a dime per drink.

""I’m hung up on the fee increase,"" he said in his floor speech, later adding, ""The deposit going from 5 to 10 cents, for instance on a case of water bottles, could literally double the price of that product in the store.""

Now, bottled water is cheap. And the bottle bill deposit is per container, not per size of said container -- so, the more containers, the more deposits (refundable, of course.)

But could a nickel increase really double the price of a set of water bottles?

A quick check at a downtown Portland Safeway showed these prices for a case (24) of half-liter water bottles:
  
- Aquafina, $4.99 each, or $3.99 each if you buy two cases. 
- Arrowhead spring water, $3.79 each at Safeway Club price. 
- Refreshe, $3.34 each on sale (Safeway Select brand). 

Wingard had similar examples, as well as a bargain price of $2.99 for a case of Crystal Geyser at an Albertsons. Tack on $2.40 and that is indeed nearly a doubling of the original price of $2.99.

But context is critical and we want to provide some of that.

One, Wingard has highlighted just about the worst-case scenario when it comes to the bottle bill deposit. Small bottles of plain water --added under the bottle bill in 2007 -- are cheap. Most deposit-worthy drinks do not cost mere pennies, they’re more like 89 cents apiece or $1.59 each or $6.99 for a six-pack.

Two, we know Wingard and others are convinced the bottle deposit will creep up to a dime -- but that’s not a done deal. Under the current bill, the deposit would stay at 5 cents unless the redemption rates falls below 80 percent for two consecutive years; the earliest measurable years are 2014 and 2015, with the soonest a dime could be levied Jan. 1, 2017. (The new canned or bottled drinks in this legislation, such as coffee, tea, energy drinks, etc. are not counted as part of redemption rates until January 2021.)

The redemption rate rate for 2009 was 75 percent, according to the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative and it’s expected to be several percentage points lower for 2010. Still, that doesn’t mean a 10-cent deposit is right around the corner.

Three, Wingard doesn’t point out that the current deposit on a case of water is already high, compared with its base cost. At $1.20, that $2.99 case of water rings up at $4.19 under the current bottle bill law.

And four, water bottle lovers can get their $1.20 or $2.40 back, just by returning the containers. It’s not a fee that you forfeit forever. And if you don’t redeem your bottles and cans, know that the beer and wine distributors will get to keep the cash.  

Wingard, in response, said he focused his statement on bottled water.

Yes, taken narrowly, the cost of a case of water could nearly double. But Wingard does a lot of heavy lifting to get to his statement and ignores two particularly crucial points: The fact that there’s already a five cent deposit on these items -- meaning, really, the percent increase of what buyers are shelling out is much smaller than 100 percent -- and also the fact that this is money that is refundable -- you get it back as soon as you return the bottles. So the ""cost"" could be zero.

Because his statement ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate his claim Barely True.

Gov. John Kasich says 60 percent of U.S. population is within 600 miles of Ohio
","
Location is commonly cited as the most important consideration in buying real estate, and geographic location was the reason that Cleveland once was tagged as being -- or occupying -- ""the best location in the nation.""

The slogan was coined in 1944 by the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., now part of FirstEnergy Corp., to help build post-war business.

""The claim was based on the fact that within 500 miles of the city lived half the people of the United States and Canada; that Cleveland was the natural meeting place of iron ore, coal, copper, gypsum, stone, sand and other vital raw materials; and that efficient water, rail, highway and air transportation facilitated delivery and reduced costs,"" wrote historians Carol Poh Miller and Robert Anthony Wheeler.  

The slogan has fallen into disuse, but geography hasn't changed.

Gov. John Kasich touted the concept this month when he spoke to the Ohio Chamber of Commerce about making Ohio more competitive for business growth:

""We're to the point now where location matters because logistics matters again,"" he said. ""Cost of shipping things matters again. We're within 600 miles of 60 percent of America. We're in a perfect location.""

Given our Buckeye bias, PolitiFact Ohio wanted to believe it. But we have examined similar claims before and found them wanting. We knew that population has shifted since the 1940s, when the population center point of the entire nation (now in Missouri) was still in Ohio. But we also noted that Kasich moved the measuring stick from 500 miles cited in those previous claims to 600 miles.

Using the tools we employed before, we built a map including all U.S. counties whose seats are located within 600 miles of Ohio's borders. We used U.S. Census Bureau data to calculate the aggregate population.

We found that 184,900,000 people live within 600 miles of Ohio, or 59.9 percent of the U.S. population of 308.7 million.

That's 60 percent, whether you round off by a number that is not statistically significant or factor a margin of error.

The 600-mile reach would include nearly all of the Eastern Seaboard, the upper Midwest, much of the Deep South and some states west of the Mississippi River.

One additional note: In addition to 60 percent of the U.S. population, Kasich’s claim also would encompass the most populous parts of Ontario and Quebec.

President Obama's press secretary says Rick Perry declined to meet president in El Paso
","
Asked why President Barack Obama didn’t meet with Texas Gov. Rick Perry during his one-day trip to Texas, White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday: ""Gov. Perry turned down our invitation to meet the president at the airport.""

Obama spokesman Adam Abrams later told us that Carney was referring to the airport in El Paso, where Obama ventured before flying to Austin for political fundraisers.

According to a White House transcript, when a reporter suggested Perry ""wanted a more substantial meeting"" and didn’t want to travel across the state ""to discuss the wildfires and border security and all that,"" Carney replied: ""Again, we invited him to meet with the president, and he declined the invitation.""

Did Perry refuse to greet Obama in El Paso?

Rewind: In August, the GOP governor experienced a 34-second handshake of a conversation with the Democratic president at Austin’s airport during which he attempted to hand him a letter urging closer attention to security along the U.S.-Mexico border. The letter was accepted by a White House adviser.

In an interview, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed confirmed that on Tuesday, the governor declined an offer from the White House to greet the president in El Paso. ""It would have been a 10-minute greeting,"" she said.

However, Nashed said, ""we did ask them if we could meet and greet the president later in Austin or if the president would be interested in"" taking a flying tour of wildfires that have hurt rural Texas. ""Unfortunately, we couldn’t arrange anything,"" Nashed said.

Separately, Perry spokesman Mark Miner was quoted in the Austin American-Statesman’s Postcards blog as saying Perry ""wanted to meet with the president to discuss the wildfires and border security, not just shake his hand in a receiving line on a tarmac.""

We asked how the governor passed the hours he could have spent journeying to and from El Paso, about 575 miles from Austin. Nashed, forwarding Perry's state schedule for that day, said he joined Jay Kimbrough, his former chief of staff and a favorite troubleshooter, in marking the anniversary of the severe wound Kimbrough endured as a Marine machine gunner in Vietnam in 1967. The two lunched in East Texas, she said, and joined a motorcycle ride to a veterans museum in Huntsville.

On May 12, as noted by the Dallas Morning News, Perry told interviewer Laura Ingraham that he didn't have time to fly to El Paso for a handshake. The newspaper said Perry told Ingraham, ""If he wanted to meet, I was in Austin. I would have been here.""

The White House did not comment on Perry’s professed offer to meet in Austin, though emails between Perry's office and the White House confirm that Perry was invited to greet the president in El Paso and that a gubernatorial aide asked if it was ""an option"" for Perry to greet Obama in Austin ""since we are here."" A White House aide replied: ""Unfortunately there won't be a tarmac greet in Austin."" PolitiFact Texas obtained the emails through an open-records request.

Our call? Perry declined to howdy the president in El Paso. However, Carney’s response implies Perry flat refused to meet when an alternative meeting prospect was floated. We rate Carney’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/may/13/jay-carney/president-obamas-press-secretary-says-rick-perry-d/

George LeMieux claims he never requested a single earmark
","
A new Web ad from the campaign for former Sen. George LeMieux claims there's a big difference between him and Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson on the issue of earmarks.

A narrator in the ad, called ""The Choice,"" says, ""Nelson voted for billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere. LeMieux never requested a single earmark and pushed to ban them all.""

We broke this claim into two fact-checks. In a separate item, we explore the claim that, ""Nelson voted for billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere. "" In this item, we will address the second half of the equation, the claim that, ""LeMieux never requested a single earmark and pushed to ban them all.""

While this is technically true, the contrast isn't as black-and-white as the ad suggests.

Here's why:

LeMieux was appointed to the Senate by then-Florida Gov. Charlie Crist to fill the remaining term of retiring Sen. Mel Martinez. LeMieux took office on Sept. 10, 2009, and served until Jan. 3, 2011.

Soon after taking office, LeMieux voted in favor of a handful of appropriations bills that included thousands of earmarks worth billions of dollars.

We'll break it down.

On Oct. 15, 2009, LeMieux voted in favor of an appropriations bill for energy and water development and related agencies for the 2010 fiscal year. According to a Congressional Research Service report, the bill included 2,293 earmarks at a cost of $5.7 billion.

On Oct. 6, 2009, and Dec. 19, 2009, LeMieux voted in favor of appropriations bills for the Department of Defense. They included 1,719 earmarks at a cost of $4.2 billion.

On Oct. 20, 2009, LeMieux voted in favor of an appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security. It included 192 earmarks at a cost of $420 million.

On Nov. 5, 2009, LeMieux voted in favor of an appropriations bill for Commerce, Justice, Science and related agencies. The bill included 1,513 earmarks at a cost of $781 million.

On Nov. 17, LeMieux voted in favor of an appropriations bill for military construction and veterans affairs. It included 745 earmarks at a cost of $14.5 billion.

In other words, LeMieux voted for bills containing billions of dollars in earmarks, the very thing the ad criticized Nelson for in the previous sentence.

But the ad is artfully worded. It doesn't say LeMieux never voted for an earmark, it says he never requested a single one.

That's true, but it's also true that earmarks bound for Florida were already packed into the appropriations bills before LeMieux took over for Martinez. We checked the earmark database for the 2010 fiscal year compiled by Taxpayers for Common Sense -- a group that tracks federal earmarks -- and found several dozen earmarks at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars requested by Martinez (sometimes jointly requested with Nelson and others) for various Florida projects, which were included in the appropriations bills that LeMieux voted for. We didn't find any evidence that LeMieux tried to remove those Florida earmarks.

We asked LeMieux about those votes via e-mail.

""I never requested an earmark,"" LeMieux said. ""It became clear to me after my first couple months in D.C., and those first appropriation bills, that earmarks are the engine that drive the train of increased spending. After that experience I had a press conference with Sens. DeMint, Graham and others pledging not to seek an earmark.""

In that press conference, the Republican legislators called for a one-year moratorium on all earmarks.

""Let me tell you why I think earmarks are a problem,"" LeMieux said at the press conference. ""They're not just a problem for the amount of the budget that they are, because it's not a huge amount. They are a problem because they are the enabler.

""In my short time here, I have seen that if you ask for a project and you bring it back for your home state, then when the budget that they bring before you on a particular appropriations bill is 10 percent, 15 percent, 20 percent, 25 percent more than last year, you can't vote against it or you'll never get another project again. So I haven't done earmarks since I've been here, and I made a decision last month not to do them for the rest of the time I'm here, because the nation is in dire financial straits.""

So there's no question LeMieux pushed to ban earmarks, as the ad claims. But to back up that point, the ad cites LeMieux's vote on Nov. 30, 2010, in favor of an amendment that sought to establish a moratorium on earmarks through the 2013 fiscal year. The amendment failed with 39 senators voting in favor (including LeMieux) and 56 against. But here's what the ad doesn't say: Nelson also voted for the moratorium.

""Sen. Nelson may have voted to ban all earmarks, but he still sought them and still supports them,"" LeMieux wrote to us in an e-mail. ""My vote was sincere.""

Also, LeMieux stated, ""I have signed a pledge not to seek any earmarks if I have the honor of serving again.""

We contacted Nelson's press office for comment but did not hear back.

Again, the wording of the earmark claims in LeMieux's ad are technically true. LeMieux has not personally requested any earmarks, and he has pushed to ban them all. But we think it's a bit hypocritical for LeMieux to call out Nelson for voting for a bill that included billions of dollars worth of earmarks (and specifically the infamous Bridge to Nowhere).

LeMieux also voted for bills that included thousands of earmarks worth billions of dollars. By the same logic in LeMieux's ad, Nelson could counter with an ad that says LeMieux voted for billions in earmarks including any number of outrageous-sounding pet projects from around the country that were included in the handful of appropriations bills LeMieux voted for in late 2009.

LeMieux makes the distinction that he never personally requested earmarks (while Nelson certainly has). But again, we think it's worth noting that the appropriations bills LeMieux voted in favor of were stuffed with dozens of Florida earmarks -- costing hundreds of millions of dollars -- that were requested by his Republican predecessor, Martinez. LeMieux has put himself out front on the issue of reining in earmarks, taking a stand early in 2010 calling for a complete ban. And LeMieux may not buy that Nelson has found religion on earmarks, but Nelson was among only a half dozen Democrats in the Senate who also voted for the earmark moratorium. We think that's a lot of missing context, and so we rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2011/may/12/george-lemieux/emigeorge-lemieux-claims-he-never-requested-single/

George LeMieux says Bill Nelson voted for billions in earmarks such as the Bridge to Nowhere
","
A new Web ad from the campaign for former Sen. George LeMieux takes on Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida over the issue of earmarks and specifically ties Nelson to perhaps the most infamous earmark ever, the so-called Bridge to Nowhere.

A narrator in the ad, called ""The Choice,"" says, ""Nelson voted for billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere. LeMieux never requested a single earmark and pushed to ban them all.""

We're going to split this claim into two fact-checks. In this item, we are looking at the first half, about Nelson's record on earmarks. But we encourage you to also look at our companion fact-check on LeMieux's claim that he ""never requested a single earmark and pushed to ban them all."" (It's not as black-and-white as the ad suggests).

The claim that ""Nelson voted for billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere,"" is backed up in the ad with a reference to Senate Roll Call Vote 264, Oct. 20, 2005.

That is the vote on a Highway Reauthorization Bill, which included $225 million for an Alaska bridge to connect the tiny city of Ketchikan to Gravina, an island with just a few dozen residents and an airport. The project was derisively nicknamed the Bridge to Nowhere by a government watchdog group and became a national symbol of federal pork-barrel spending.

Nelson voted in favor of the highway bill, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, 93-1.

To be clear, this was not an up-or-down vote on the Bridge to Nowhere. The bill included $286.5 billion through 2009 for highway, mass transit, safety and research programs. The Alaska bridge was less than a tenth of 1 percent of total spending in the bill. We couldn't find any evidence prior to the vote that Nelson had an opinion about the Alaska bridge one way or the other.

In a press release that year, Nelson touted the fact that there was $8.6 billion in the bill for Florida road projects, including widening Interstate 75 from Fort Myers to Naples; constructing the Interstate 4 crosstown connector in the Tampa Bay area; improving I-4 alternate routes in Orlando; and widening the bypass around Tallahassee.

However, Nelson did have an opportunity to specifically eliminate funding for the Bridge to Nowhere when U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., proposed an amendment that would have redirected $125 million in funding for the Alaska bridge toward reconstruction of a New Orleans bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina. That amendment failed 82-15, and Nelson was among those who voted against it. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., criticized then-Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., for a similar vote. Obama and others said they voted against the Coburn amendment not because they agreed with funding for the Bridge to Nowhere, but because they felt it was wrong to single out one state's pork project without eliminating them for all the states (or, they feared their pork projects might be on the chopping block the next time). 
Incidentally, the Bridge to Nowhere never did get the money. A congressional committee directed the $225 million earmarked for the Gravina Island bridge to the Alaska Department of Transportation to spend the money as it saw fit. Although Alaska officials still could have decided to spend it on the bridge, ultimately the price tag for the project ballooned and the money was spent elsewhere. 
But back to LeMieux's claim that Nelson voted for ""billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere."" 
""He did,"" said Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that tracks federal earmarks. ""He supported bills, along with many other senators, that had billions of dollars of earmarks in them."" 
According to an analysis by Taxpayers for Common Sense, the highway bill in question included more than 6,000 earmarks at a cost of more than $24 billion. 
""Whether they were 'wasteful' or not all depends on who you talk to,"" Ellis said. ""But along with the the rank and file, he (Nelson) has certainly been someone who actively participated in the earmarking game. I wouldn't put him in the pantheon of earmarkers, but he certainly played the game."" 
We've docked politicians before for stretching the truth by claiming their opponent supported the Bridge to Nowhere simply because they voted for that highway bill in 2005. But this ad paints with a broader brush, criticizing Nelson for voting for billions of dollars worth of earmarks such as the Bridge to Nowhere. Nelson may not have specifically supported the Bridge to Nowhere project, but there's no question he voted in favor of a bill that was known to include billions of dollars worth of road project earmarks, some of which Nelson had requested for Florida.

"['National', 'Children', 'Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'Sherrod Brown']","
Sherrod Brown says elderly account for two-thirds of Medicaid's costs
","
During a May 10, 2011, interview on MSNBC, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, defended Medicaid from a Republican proposal to change the structure of the federal-state health insurance program for the poor.

MSNBC’s Cenk Uygur asked Brown whether the Democrats will have ""as much passion and fight in defending Medicaid"" as they have on criticizing GOP proposals to overhaul Medicare for those currently under 55 years of age.

Brown said Democrats would fight just as hard. ""It's a nonstarter,"" he said. ""It hurts two groups of people. It hurts poor kids. … About two-thirds of Medicaid beneficiaries are children. They are only one-third of the cost, because kids don't get sick as much. The other part of Medicaid is seniors, many of them in nursing homes, low-income, moderate-income seniors who don't have a lot of assets. That's about a third of the individuals in Medicaid but two-thirds of the costs, because … it costs more to take care of a senior than a child.

""So they are going after young -- they`re going after poor children and low-income, moderate-income, low-asset, if you will, seniors,"" Brown concluded. ""And that ain`t going to work either because the public gets it.""

We wondered whether Brown had the numbers right -- that two-thirds of Medicaid beneficiaries are children, but they account for one-third of the program’s cost, while one-third are elderly, and they account for two-thirds of the cost.

We turned to statistics produced by the federal agency that runs Medicaid -- the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. First, we’ll look at the figures that break down who enrolls in the program. Table IV.8 here offers two different measurements -- average monthly enrollment and individual enrollees on an annual basis. Since the numbers are similar, we’ll make things simpler and choose the latter yardstick.

All told, 68.2 million individuals used Medicaid in 2010. Of that 5.8 million were ""aged"" -- 65 and older -- while 33.9 million were children. An additional 9 million are counted separately as recipients of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program of SCHIP. (Children are the predominant beneficiaries of SCHIP, though this figure also includes some adults covered under waivers; we’ll ignore that in our calculations.)

So 8.5 percent of Medicaid's beneficiaries are aged, and 63 percent are children. That means Brown is quite close on the percentage of beneficiaries who are children, but too low for the percentage of beneficiaries who are elderly.

If Brown had adjusted his statement to ""elderly, blind or disabled,"" he would have been closer. Adding those categories together gets the figure to 24 percent, although even that’s well below the one-third Brown stated.

Now, we’ll look at expenditures, using data from Table II.4 here. The most recent data is from 2007.

The table shows that 20.7 percent of Medicaid payments were made for beneficiaries age 65 and over, while 19.4 percent supported children.

Both numbers are well below what Brown said. He’d said that the elderly account for two-thirds of the cost, when in fact they’re just over 20 percent, and that children account for one-third, when they’re actually less than 20 percent.

The biggest complicating factor is that the single largest category of payments -- 43.3 percent -- is for those who are blind or disabled. Because the statistics are not broken down by age, we can’t be sure what the final distribution is.

However, if Brown had adjusted his statement to ""elderly, blind or disabled,"" he would have been close to correct about payments. The combined category would be 64 percent, just under the two-thirds he cited in the interview.

When we asked Brown’s office for further information about the senator’s claim, his spokeswoman said that Brown had intended to combine ""elderly, blind or disabled"" into one category but failed to use the more inclusive description on camera. She said he has made that point in the past when responding to constituent letters on the issue.

Even when Brown leaves out blind and disabled beneficiaries from the calculation, he still has a point, said Henry Aaron of the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. Brown’s underlying point is that the elderly account for a disproportionate share of Medicaid’s costs. By our strictest accounting, elderly beneficiaries are 8.5 percent of those served but account for 20.7 percent of payments -- a cost burden two and a half times the size of their numbers.

""The central point, not widely understood, is correct: Although kids account for most of the enrollment, the elderly and disabled account for most of the cost,"" Aaron said. ""That difference -- enrollments vs. cost -- is the key point, and he has that right.""

In the midst of a television interview, Brown erred in recounting Medicaid’s statistics, oversimplifying figures on both enrollment and costs. In reality, elderly beneficiaries by themselves account for nowhere close to the two-thirds of Medicaid’s costs that Brown suggested. His point that spending on the elderly is disproportionate to their numbers is valid, and he would have been close to accurate if he’d said the ""elderly, blind and disabled,"" as his office said he had intended to. Still, the numbers viewers heard were mostly incorrect, so we rate Brown’s statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/may/12/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-says-elderly-account-two-thirds-medi/
"['Education', 'Virginia', 'Tim Kaine']","
Tim Kaine says Virginia's higher education, income records have dramatically improved in past 50 years
","
Shortly after former Gov. Tim Kaine announced his U.S. Senate campaign, he spoke about how far Virginia has come over the past half century.

""I’m passionate about the Virginia economic story,"" Kaine, a Democrat, said in an April 21 interview with WAVY -TV in Portsmouth. ""We were near the bottom of the nation 50 years ago in per capita income. We’re top 10 now. We were very low in higher ed attainment rate 50 years ago. We’re greater than the national average now.""

We wondered whether Kaine was right.

Let’s start with his statement on per capita income. It’s true the state now ranks in the top 10 in that measure. The federal Bureau of Economic Analysis found in a March 23, 2011, report that Virginia’s per capita personal income in 2010 was $44,762 - the seventh highest in the U.S.

Where did the state rank five decades ago?

Figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis show Virginia had a per capita income of $1,906 in 1960, making it the 34th among the 50 states. In 1961, Virginia’s per capita income was $1,975 -- the 17th lowest.

So 50 years ago, Virginia was the top state in the lower third of the country in terms of the level of its per capita income.

One could argue that being 15 or so spots away from last place doesn’t rank the state ""near the bottom"" as Kaine said.  

Let’s turn to Kaine’s comments on how Virginia’s level of higher education attainment has grown in the last half-century.

U.S. Census Bureau estimates from 2005 to 2009 show that 33.4 percent of Virginians age 25 and older had a bachelor’s or a higher degree. That was above the national average of 27.5 percent in the age group who had attained at least a bachelor’s degree.

So Kaine is right that Virginia outpaces the nation on this measure. The Old Dominion had the sixth highest percentage of people 25 and older who have received a bachelor’s degree or higher.

Now for some historical perspective:

A U.S. Census Bureau report examining higher education attainment found that in 1960, 8.4 percent of Virginia residents age 25 or older had earned at least a bachelor’s degree. That may seem like a small number, but it was actually higher than the national average of 7.7 percent that year.

Among states, Virginia had the 16th highest percentage of residents 25 and older who received a bachelor’s degree or beyond.

In short, Virginia’s level educational attainment 50 years ago wasn’t as dire as Kaine made it out to be. In fact it was pretty good compared to the rest of the country.

To sum up:

Kaine was absolutely right in assessing how Virginia ranks today in per capita income and higher education attainment. But his claims about where the Old Dominion stood 50 years ago have problems.

Virginia’s per capita income was indeed lower than most of its peers five decades ago, but there were about 15 states that had lower income levels than Virginia. It’s a bit of stretch for Kaine to say Virginia was ""near the bottom.,"" Virginia was closer to the middle than the bottom.

On higher education attainment, Virginia 50 years ago outpaced the national average and most other states in the percentage of its residents earning a bachelor’s degree or higher.

So Kaine’s statement that the state had a ""very low"" rate of higher education attainment 50 years doesn’t pan out.

Kaine was right about the present, wrong about the past. Putting the parts together, we rate his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2011/may/12/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-virginias-higher-education-record-h/
"['Labor', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Gwen Moore']","
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker invented the state’s $3.6 billion deficit
","
The Wisconsin Democratic Party billed its Founders Day Gala as an event to ""focus on resistance to Scott Walker's divisive power grab.""

Among the speakers who dressed down Wisconsin’s Republican governor at the April 30, 2011 event was U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wisconsin.

Moore began her remarks by referring to the keynote speaker, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, and his new memoir, A Reason to Believe.

""I was thinking: How in the world can you believe, what reason would you have to believe in anything, when you had just elected a governor who says that Wisconsin was open for business and therefore closed to every single human being in the state,"" Moore said to applause.

Moore said Walker was cutting funding for schools, Medicaid, birth control and public transportation, but providing ""$200 million worth of tax breaks -- and (he) just literally invented a $3.6 billion budget deficit.""

Wait a minute. ""Literally invented""?

We’ve been down this road a couple of times before. 
We asked Moore what proof she had that Walker had invented a $3.6 billion deficit. We’ll address point by point the response we received from Moore’s spokesman, David Frey:

Point 1: Moore thinks Walker ""made the state’s fiscal situation worse"" and the fiscal bureau ""spells out the costs of his tax cuts.""  Frey noted the bureau said Walker’s 2011-2013 budget includes $83 million in tax cuts.

But that figure doesn’t address the size of the budget deficit, which existed before Walker proposed his budget in March 2011. And it ignores the fact that the budget also includes $49 million in tax increases.

Frey also noted $117 million less the state will take in because of other Walker tax changes, but that figure also does not go to the size of the deficit, either.  

Point 2: Moore thinks that when compared to other states, Wisconsin’s budget situation ""is much more manageable.""  

That’s largely opinion and it doesn’t specify the size of Wisconsin’s deficit.

Point 3: Moore thinks Walker ""is making all the wrong choices on this matter.""

Another opinion that doesn’t get to the deficit question.

Point 4: Walker’s changes to state laws to reduce the collective bargaining powers of public employees ""were more about ideology than about budget issues.""

Again, that’s an opinion -- one widely shared by Walker critics. But, like the others, that’s not on point in terms of the size of the budget deficit.

(On May 11, 2011, a new projection showed the state would take in about $200 million a year more than previously estimated over three years. It is unclear how Walker and the Legislature will adjust the budget proposal. But this, too, does not go to Moore’s claim, which was made before the new projection was released.)

In sum, Moore doesn’t provide any evidence to back her claim -- which means we find ourselves at a familiar destination.

Moore said Walker ""literally invented"" a $3.6 billion state budget deficit. We’ve previously established that the figure is a reasonable estimate. Moore offers no new evidence to the contrary. We rate her claim False.",/factchecks/2011/may/12/gwen-moore/us-rep-gwen-moore-says-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-/

State Rep. Matt Lundy says House GOP added extra tax breaks to sweeten sales pitch on prisons
","
Gov. John Kasich’s wish to sell off six state prisons has become yet another partisan political hot potato in Columbus. Then again, what isn’t during budget season.

But state Rep. Matt Lundy, an Elyria Democrat, kicked it up a notch with comments during a May 2 news conference called for the purpose of throwing cold water on the Republican governor’s plan to sell off five adult prison facilities and one youth detention center.

Kasich has said the transaction could net Ohio a profit of $200 million.

Lundy disagrees. He argues that there still will be bonds and improvement debts to be serviced and that will cut into the profit.

He likened the proposal to an ""insane yard sale"" and questioned the logic of selling state assets during a down economic period when they may fetch low bids.

He also accused Republicans in control of the House of helping Kasich to lure buyers.

""The substitute budget now adds in tax breaks and tax deductions for those who buy these prisons,"" Lundy said. The House passed its version of the budget on May 5.

Politifact Ohio decided to take a closer look.

The House did propose a sales tax exemption, income tax deduction and commercial tax exclusion for any buyer that strikes a deal with Ohio to take over the prisons offered for sale. Lundy said such friendly trinkets will eat away at the state’s expect profits on the deal.

So, why was it included? Kasich’s proposal didn’t offer the tax breaks but the House Republicans did.

House Finance Chairman Ron Amstutz, a Wooster Republican, said the tax provisions were added to assure that the private buyer of the prisons would be treated like any other state entity since they will essentially be performing a state function by housing inmates.

""Typically state entities don’t pay taxes on their functions and that is true of local governments, as well,"" Amstutz said. ""And I think the desire is to maintain that status in order to provide for services at the lowest cost that we can.""

If the private entities were to pay these particular taxes, which go back to supporting the local communities where the facilities are located, then ""basically the state taxpayers would be subsidizing the local taxpayers at that point for a state function and typically we don’t do that,"" Amstutz explained.

State prisons spokesman Carlo LoParo noted, however, that any buyer of the state prisons would be expected to pay property taxes each year, which would net a huge amount of cash for the local governments where there facilities are located.

""That’s pretty substantial,"" LoParo said. He added that the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections had closely monitored the House negotiations to make sure that a carve out for property taxes was not stuck in.

""We took pains to make sure there were no loopholes,"" he said. ""We fully expect them to pay property taxes to those communities where the prisons are located.""

The impact for local governments could be substantial.

For example, there are two facilities offered for sale that are in Marion -- the North Central Correctional Institution that houses adults and the Marion Juvenile Correctional Facility, which is currently closed.

Combined, the two properties are valued at $100 million, which would result in about $1.5 million annually in property tax collections for that small city. LoParo said that should be enough money help Marion’s police force pick up criminal investigations at the two facilities, which would fall to the city and not state highway patrol, as is currently the case.

So where does Lundy land on the Truth-O-Meter.

Lundy is correct that the the substitute budget includes tax breaks and tax deductions for those who buy the prisons. There would be no sales tax on the purchase and there are other exclusions for income and commercial taxes.

The administration is demanding that local property taxes absolutely be paid, which could yield significant revenue to local governments and schools.

And Lundy is correct that the tax breaks and deductions in the budget bill were added in by the House.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Lundy’s comment as True.

Newt Gingrich inaccurate in budget, debt claims in video announcement
","
In the runup to the May 11, 2011 announcement that he will run for president, Newt Gingrich has reminded folks about the good old days of the American economy when he was speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.

""For four years, we balanced the budget and paid off $405 billion in debt,"" Gingrich said in a video on his campaign website.

With soft music in the background, Gingrich says with a smile, ""We’ve done it before. We can do it again.""

Gingrich was speaker from January 1995 to January 1999, when he was a Republican congressman from Atlanta’s suburbs.

PolitiFact decided to check Gingrich’s claims about the budget and debt, since he and other Republicans have criticized President Barack Obama’s stewardship of the economy, hoping to convince voters that the incumbent doesn't deserve a second term.

First, the balanced budget.

The federal budget runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins October 1 and ends September 30. During fiscal years 1996 and 1997 -- the first two that Gingrich helped shape as speaker -- there were deficits, of $107 billion in 1996 and about $22 billion in 1997.

By fiscal year 1998, the federal budget did reach a surplus of $69 billion. And in fiscal year 1999 -- which Gingrich can claim some responsibility for, even though he was out as speaker for most of the fiscal year -- it was in surplus as well, to the tune of $126 billion.

But that’s only two balanced budgets he can claim credit for. The federal government did run four consecutive surpluses, but for the last two of those -- fiscal years 2000 and 2001 -- Gingrich was no longer serving in the House.

Now for Gingrich’s comments about the debt.

The national debt was slightly above $4.8 trillion when Gingrich became House speaker in January 1995. By the time he left the position in January 1999, the debt was more than $5.6 trillion. That’s an increase, not a decrease.

If you look just at the two years Gingrich can claim credit for where the federal government was in surplus -- fiscal years 1998 and 1999 -- the government did pay down about $200 billion in debt. But that would be cherry-picking, because over the full four years of his speakership, the debt rose by about $800 billion.

Efforts to contact Gingrich’s top spokesman, Rick Tyler, were unsuccessful.

To summarize, Gingrich was off on both claims concerning the budget. The budget was indeed balanced for four years, but it’s a stretch for him to take credit for more than two of those years.

As for paying off $405 billion in debt, the data we found shows the debt actually increased during Gingrich’s four-year tenure as speaker by more than $800 billion.

We rate Gingrich’s claim False.  ",/factchecks/2011/may/12/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-inaccurate-budget-debt-claims-video-/

Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich did the, well, expected Wednesday, May 11, 2011, and announced his candidacy for president.

The former Georgia congressman made it official in a campaign video on his website, as he had signaled earlier in the week. Gingrich promoted his credentials by touting a list of accomplishments in his four years as House Speaker, which began in January 1995 and ended in January 1999.

Those accomplishments included cutting unemployment, which was at 9 percent in April 2011 and one of the nation’s biggest problems.

""Unemployment came down from 5.6 percent to under 4,"" Gingrich, a Republican who now lives in Virginia, said in the video.

Considering that Republican candidates will likely attack President Barack Obama over the unemployment rate as the presidential race heats up, Gingrich’s claim may sound like he has the solution to the problem or at the very least be able to argue he can do better than the Democratic president has done.

In that vein, we wanted to check Gingrich’s numbers.

In January 1995, the month Gingrich took the gavel as speaker, the nation’s unemployment rate was indeed 5.6 percent. The unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent by December 1998, the month Gingrich announced he was going to resign as speaker. The rate dropped one-tenth of a percentage point by January 1999, when Gingrich resigned. Each tenth of percentage point at that time equaled about 50,000 unemployed Americans.

The unemployment rate didn’t fall below 4 percent until September 2000, which was 21 months later. The lowest the unemployment rate fell during Gingrich’s time as speaker was in April 1998, when it was 4.3 percent.

An e-mail to a Gingrich spokesman late Wednesday was not immediately returned.

Gingrich was correct about the unemployment rate when he became House Speaker and correct that it did go down, but he was wrong in saying it went down to 4 percent during his term as speaker. The lowest rate it hit during his tenure as speaker was 4.3 percent. He could have easily looked it up and gotten it right. We rate his claim as False.",/factchecks/2011/may/12/newt-gingrich/gingrich-unemployment-rate-claim-target/

Barack Obama says the United States has doubled exports during his presidency
","
During a May 10, 2011, speech at a Democratic National Committee event in Austin, Texas, President Barack Obama offered a litany of accomplishments to a friendly audience. 
""We passed equal pay for equal work legislation,"" Obama said. ""We made the largest investment in education in our history, but didn’t just put more money in, initiating unprecedented reforms that are having ramifications all across the country. We made the largest investment in clean energy in our history and have created entire new industries, like the advanced battery manufacturing industry here in the United States of America, where we look like we'll have close to a 40-percent share of the market in the next few years. Doubled our exports. Ended a war, as promised, and are working another war in a place where we're going to start drawing down our troops this year and are in a position to help Afghans secure their own country.""

The claim that immediately caught our eye was that during Obama’s presidency, the United States has ""doubled our exports."" So we decided to take a look.

We turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, which produces monthly statistical tables on trade. One table offers data that begins in January 2009 -- when Obama was inaugurated -- and ends in March 2011. It shows imports and exports on a monthly, annual and year-to-date basis, all of them seasonally adjusted.

Here are a few ways to slice and dice the numbers.

Most recent month compared to January 2009: In January 2009, exports of goods and services were $125.5 billion. For March 2011, that number was $172.7 billion -- a 38 percent increase.

Most recent month compared to the equivalent month in 2009: In March 2009, exports totaled $126 billion. For March 2011, that number was $172.7 billion -- a 37 percent increase.

First quarter of 2011 compared to first quarter of 2009: In the first quarter of 2009, exports were $378.4 billion. For the first quarter of 2011, exports were $505.2 billion -- a 34 percent increase.

Extrapolated amount for all of 2011 compared to the actual amount from all of 2009: For all of 2009, exports totaled $1.571 trillion. Multiplying the first-quarter 2011 results by four produces a full-year projection of $2.021 trillion for 2011 -- a 29 percent increase.

All told, then, the data show an increase in exports of about one-third from the baseline Obama inherited -- not double.

This isn’t the first time Obama has spoken of doubling exports. In his 2011 State of the Union address, he said, ""To help businesses sell more products abroad, we set a goal of doubling our exports by 2014 -– because the more we export, the more jobs we create here at home. Already, our exports are up.""

But Bryan Riley, a senior trade policy analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation, noted that the president hasn’t met the goal yet. ""Exports are up but have not doubled,"" Riley said.

When we presented the data to the White House, a spokesman did not dispute our numbers. ""The president is committed to doubling our exports within five years and we have already made substantial progress toward that goal,"" said White House spokesman Adam Abrams.

So Obama was getting ahead of the facts when he said that the United States has doubled its exports. That’s the goal, and progress toward it is being made. The doubling hasn’t happened yet. So we rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2011/may/11/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-has-doubled-exports-during-hi/

John Boehner says Bush tax cuts created 8 million jobs over 10 years
","
During an interview on NBC’s Today show, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, offered some job-creation statistics to cast a favorable light on the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003.

Host Matt Lauer said to Boehner, ""You talk about creating jobs. When the Bush era tax cuts were passed in 2001, unemployment in this country was 4.5 percent. Today it's at 9 percent, just down from 10 percent. So why are the Bush era tax cuts creating jobs?""

Boehner responded that the tax cuts ""created about 8 million jobs over the first 10 years that they were in existence. We've lost about 5 million of those jobs during this recession.""

Several readers suggested that we check Boehner’s statistics. So we did. 
Boehner's statement actually has several problems. One is the question of whether the tax cuts actually caused the job growth; more on that later. First, we’ll point out something more basic -- that Boehner’s chronology is off. 
The first of the tax cuts was passed in June 2001, so we haven’t hit a full 10 years since the first cut was enacted, and we’re only about eight years past the enactment of the second round of cuts. We’ll give Boehner the most generous parameters possible -- from the signing of the first tax cut in June 2001 until the pre-recession employment peak, which came in January 2008. (When we contacted Boehner’s office, they confirmed that this is the comparison he had in mind.)

We turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- specifically, figures from the Current Employment Statistics series, which is calculated using a broad survey of employer payroll data. Here are the numbers:

June 2001: 132,047,000 people employed
January 2008: 137,996,000 people employed
Increase during that six-and-a-half-year period: 5,949,000 people 

That’s roughly 6 million jobs -- significantly below the 8 million Boehner cited.

Now let’s turn to the jobs lost during the recession. We once again calculated the numbers in the way most favorable to Boehner -- from the peak of employment (January 2008) to the lowest point (February 2010). Here are the figures:

January 2008: 137,996,000 people employed
February 2010: 129,246,000 people employed
Decrease during the roughly two-year period: 8,750,000 people 

That’s almost 9 million jobs lost -- almost twice what Boehner had said on Today.

What’s going on?

When we reached Boehner’s office, spokesman Michael Steel provided a different set of numbers -- numbers that we determined were from a different set of BLS statistics, known as the Current Population Survey.

The numbers from the CPS data are produced by a smaller survey of individuals and families. They are best known for producing the widely tracked national unemployment rate, but the data also include an estimate of the raw number of employed Americans, which is what Boehner used.

Here are the CPS figures for the same periods we looked at above:

June 2001: 136,873,000 people employed
January 2008: 146,407,000 people employed
Increase over about six and a half years: 9,534,000 people 

January 2008: 146,407,000 people employed
February 2010: 138,698,000 people employed
Decrease over about two years: 7,709,000 people 

So using the CPS figures, Boehner actually underestimated the jobs created after the passage of the Bush tax cuts, rather than overestimating them. And his number of jobs lost in the recession was closer to the CPS number than to the CES number.

In other words, using one set of data, Boehner’s way off, and using another set, he’s closer. What gives?

For the periods studied, the two data sets’ varying methodologies appear to have produced large differences in the number of jobs created and lost. While both statistics have their advantages and disadvantages, the CES numbers are ""usually preferred when talking about job growth or loss,"" said Stacey Standish, a BLS spokeswoman.

And there’s this problem: What if we had used Boehner's 10 year figure rather than the six-and-a-half-year upswing of jobs? Over the full 10 years, employment has actually fallen by more than 1 million jobs using CES numbers and risen by 2.8 million according to the CPS figures. Either way, both figures are well below the job gains Boehner touted for the full 10-year period. 
Meanwhile, there are other concerns beyond the statistics. While J.D. Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said he feels both CES and CPS are valid measures, he wondered whether Boehner had oversold cause and effect. ""The real issue is the statement that the Bush tax cuts ‘created’ these jobs,"" Foster said. ""Would the economy have created no jobs during this period but for the tax cuts?"" 
And Gary Burtless, a labor economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, argues that ""the more basic point is that under either measure of employment gain, the proportional rise in employment in the Bush Administration after passage of his initial tax cut was comparatively small.""

Burtless put together a comparison of recent two-term presidential administrations’ job growth over the equivalent period -- the 81 months starting in the June after the president’s inauguration. George W. Bush produced smaller job gains than most recent administrations regardless of which employment measure is used.

Employment under Bush grew by 4.5 percent using CES and 7 percent using CPS, whereas employment grew by double digits under presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, and also under the combined eight-year administrations of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, who finished Nixon's term after he resigned, and John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Only under Eisenhower was job growth more sluggish than it was under George W. Bush, and even then, it was only the case using one of the two BLS statistics. (Burtless did not compare job growth during the administrations of George H.W. Bush or Jimmy Carter because they served only one term each.)

Where does all this leave us? First, under the most common yardstick for measuring employment -- the CES data -- Boehner's claim is significantly overstated. Second, while Boehner is closer when using a different statistic, it’s only more accurate if he uses a time period much different than the one he stated in the interview. And third, his suggestion that the tax cuts are primarily responsible for subsequent job growth is contentious at best (and the job growth he points to is modest compared to previous administrations).

So the numbers Boehner offers are accurate only with significant adjustments. Overall, we find his statement too flawed to give it a rating higher than False.",/factchecks/2011/may/11/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-bush-tax-cuts-created-8-million-/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama says deportation of criminals up 70 percent under his administration
","In a speech on immigration reform in El Paso, Texas, President Barack Obama said his administration has focused on deporting illegal immigrants convicted of crimes.

""Beyond the border, we’re going after employers who knowingly exploit people and break the law,"" Obama said in the speech on May 10, 2011. ""And we are deporting those who are here illegally. And that’s a tough issue. It’s a source of controversy.

""But I want to emphasize we’re not doing it haphazardly. We’re focusing our limited resources and people on violent offenders and people convicted of crimes -- not just families, not just folks who are just looking to scrape together an income. And as a result, we’ve increased the removal of criminals by 70 percent.""

Obama's claim that under his administration, deportation of criminals increased by 70 percent suggests a significant shift in policy, so we decided to check it out.

According to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security, the number of illegal immigrants ""removed""  rose about 6 percent  -- from 369,221 to 392,862  -- between the end of September 2008 (four months before Obama took office) and the end of September 2010. But a much larger percentage of those deported were convicted criminals. In 2008, 31 percent were criminals; but by 2010, the percentage jumped to 50 percent.

The raw number of convicted criminals who were deported went from 114,415 in 2008 to 195,772 in 2010. That's 71 percent. So that squares with Obama's claim.

Data for the first half of the 2011 fiscal year (which began at the end of September) suggests that trend is continuing, with about 52 percent of the deportations involving convicted criminals.

In an Oct. 6, 2010, press release, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the numbers reflect the administration's ""prioritizing the identification and removal of criminal aliens who pose a threat to public safety.""

""Our approach has yielded historic results, removing more convicted criminal aliens than ever before and issuing more financial sanctions on employers who knowingly and repeatedly violate immigration laws than during the entire previous administration,"" Napolitano said.

Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA, a group that favors reducing immigration into the United States, said it's true that the deportation rate, particularly deportation of convicted criminals, has been higher under Obama.

""My sense is that Obama deserves credit, for all the complaints about him, that he has done maybe a little better than Bush on deportations,"" Beck said. ""I think the main context, though, is that the amount of deportations under Bush was rather small.""

And even under Obama, Beck said, the administration is talking about fewer than 400,000 deportations in a country with an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants.

DHS statistics show that under Bush, overall deportations more than tripled between 2001 and 2008 -- going from 116,782 to 369,221. But in the latter part of Bush's presidency, the biggest jump was in the deportation of illegal immigrants who were were not convicted criminals. During the eight years of Bush's presidency, deportation of convicted criminals rose from 71,079 in 2001 to 114,415 in 2008. That's a 61 percent increase over eight years.

In the first two years under Obama, the data suggest a policy shift toward prioritizing the deportation of convicted criminals. And Obama is correct that there has been a 70 percent increase.

Jim Moran says U.S. oil production at highest level since '03
","
With gas prices averaging $3.97 a gallon in the United States, Congress is taking up energy legislation that offers good talking points, if not immediate relief at the pump.

On May 5, the House passed the ""Restarting Offshore Leasing Now Act,"" a measure aimed at forcing the Department of the Interior to auction offshore drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Virginia during the next year. Oil companies would bid for the leases and then build drilling rigs at the sites.

The measure won virtually unanimous support from Republicans, as well as votes from 33 Democrats. But Rep. Jim Moran, D-8th, opposed the measure and criticized it in a press release.

Moran said the bill was about ""currying favor"" with the oil industry, not cutting energy prices. He  said drilling off the Virginia coast could interfere with Navy training operations. Furthermore, Moran said, ""American oil production is at its highest level since 2003.""

We wondered if America’s oil wells are really pumping their highest output in eight years.

The Energy Information Administration, part of the Department of Energy, is the clearinghouse for U.S. and global data on oil production and consumption. According to EIA data, the U.S. produced 5.5 million barrels of oil per day in 2010, up from 5.4 million barrels per day in 2009. That is indeed the highest number since 2003, when production was 5.7 million barrels per day.

It’s interesting to note that U.S. production for the past decade has been below 6 million barrels a day. In the 1970s, production ranged from 8.1 million to 9.6 million barrels a day. And through most of the 1980s, it was above 8 million barrels a day.

In March, after President Barack Obama made the same claim as Moran, PolitiFact’s national staff reviewed the statement. Rather than study the daily average, they reviewed the annual number of barrels produced.

Here are the annual totals for barrels produced, going back to 2003.

2003: 2,073,453,000
2004: 1,983,302,000
2005: 1,890,106,000
2006: 1,862,259,000
2007: 1,848,450,000
2008: 1,811,817,000
2009: 1,956,596,000
2010: 2,011,856,000

When PolitiFact national first reviewed this claim, the EIA was expecting to see a 110,000 barrels-per-day decline in production during 2011, followed by another 200,000 barrels-per-day drop in 2012. But an updated May energy outlook projected a decline of only 20,000 barrels per day, followed by an additional 60,000 barrels per day decline in 2012. The agency said the reductions would come largely in Alaska, due to maturing oil fields, and the Gulf of Mexico.  

If you’re curious, U.S. demand for crude oil was about 18.8 million barrels per day during 2009 and 19.1 million barrels per day during 2010. The daily global demand for oil during 2009 was 84.3 million barrels per day, meaning the U.S. accounted for 22 percent of the world’s oil consumption that year.

As we’ve reported before, the U.S. possesses about 1.5 percent of the world’s proven oil reserves.

Let’s review.

Moran said,  ""American oil production is at its highest level since 2003."" He’s right that production hit a seven-year peak in 2010. The government projects a decline could be imminent. But at this point, there is no solid evidence that the decline has begun.

When PolitiFact national evaluated this issue in March, the EIA was projecting a sizable production decline this year. They have since significantly lowered their projections on how much production will fall.

We rate Moran’s statement True.  ",/factchecks/2011/may/11/jim-moran/jim-moran-says-us-oil-production-highest-level-03/

One Wisconsin Now says two-thirds of Wisconsin corporations don’t pay state income taxes
","
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s push for major cuts in education funding and state employee compensation rests on his claim of a fiscal emergency he traces mainly to government overspending.

But Democrats and liberal groups say skewed tax policies favoring the wealthy and business at the expense of the middle class are big factors in the state’s budget shortfalls.

Efforts to make that case have often centered on this phrase: ""Two-thirds of Wisconsin corporations don't pay state income taxes.""

The liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now -- through its affiliated research arm, Institute for One Wisconsin -- has been part of the effort to get that phrase before the public.

The institute’s April report, ""We’re Not Broke,"" called that two-thirds number ""shocking,"" arguing it was evidence that businesses here don’t pay their fair share because of tax loopholes, credits and Wisconsin’s below-average corporate tax rates.

With Walker advocating repealing the corporate income tax altogether, we thought it was time to get to the bottom of this claim.

When asked to back up the claim, Scot Ross, executive director of both One Wisconsin groups, pointed to a 2011 Department of Revenue report and an analysis of corporate taxation by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Both use 2007 data, which state officials say was the latest and best available as of early 2011.

A quick word about the numbers: The universe we are dealing with is corporate income taxes paid by regular ""C"" corporations at the 7.9% corporate rate -- one of the largest sources of state tax revenue.

The Revenue Department study intentionally excludes ""S"" corporations and limited liability companies that pass through income to multiple owners or partners. They are taxed at lower rates under the personal income tax system, rather than corporate.

Officials at both agencies report this: Of 52,497 corporate returns, 17,564 had a tax liability totaling almost $703 million.

By our math, that’s 66.5 percent of the corporations with no liability  -- the two-thirds in the claim.

We wondered if this was a one-year spike.

It’s not.

Revenue Department officials ran a special report for us. It showed the same 66% figure with little variation in 2004, ’05, ’06 and ’07.

They threw in a bonus year, 2008 -- and the share of corporations that didn’t have any tax liability jumped to 69 percent in that year. (The 2008 data was not available when the Institute for One Wisconsin did its report).

In fact, the two-thirds mirrors things at the federal level.

The Government Accountability Office reported that at least 60 percent of all U.S. companies -- including many small ones -- reported no federal income-tax liability from 1998 to 2005, according to a Wall Street Journal article from 2008.

How can it be that at least two out of three corporations pay no tax? Part of the answer lies in the same Revenue Department table.

Very close to two-thirds of those 52,497 Wisconsin corporate filers reported zero net income or a net loss in 2007 -- leaving them with no tax liability.

""Just because some corporations are large and profitable, it does not follow all corporations are large and profitable,"" said John Koskinen, chief economist in the state Department of Revenue. ""Most corporations are very small with little or no profit.""

The president of Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a research organization, put it this way:

""It’s worth stating the obvious -- if a company is making no money after expenses, it will not pay taxes,"" said Todd Berry. ""Depreciation is such an expense (deduction) -- and one that is generally accepted.""

Additionally, some companies are inactive in a given year, noted Stephanie Marquis, spokeswoman for the state Department of Revenue.

A significant number of individuals -- as opposed to corporations -- also do not have a tax liability. Some 31% did not owe income taxes, according to a 2009 revenue department figures. But that understates the number who didn’t owe taxes, possibly by a large amount, because households with low incomes do not have to file, according to our calculations based on census data.

We asked Ross, among those who have cited the number, why he called it ""shocking"" that firms with no net income would not pay taxes.

Ross pointed to the multitude of tax credits and deductions. When used, they can take a profitable firm and reduce its bottom line to zero for tax purposes.

The state revenue report confirms the phenomena: A small number of corporations had net income, but still didn’t owe any state income taxes.

In total, 390 profitable firms that paid no state income tax claimed enough in tax credits that reduced their tax liability to zero, the Revenue Department report notes. So that means tax credits allowed 2% of firms with net income to avoid taxes.

But that’s just a slice of how many firms got tax preferences to reduce their corporate income taxes.

In addition to the dozen or more tax credits for corporations, state records list more than 20 other breaks in the form of deductions, exclusions and special treatment, a state report shows.

The total tax break for all the preferences was more than $254 million in 2008, according to that Revenue Department report.

So it’s clear that tax breaks can have a big impact on corporate tax collections, which in Wisconsin rate in the middle of the pack or lower nationally, a Journal Sentinel investigation found in 2010.

Proponents of business tax breaks say it’s important to give incentives for business expansion and improvement. Critics say their pro-business impact is unclear.

Despite the controversy over the whole issue, no comprehensive study exists to quantify why firms report no net income. State officials say that  would require an individual review of tens of thousands of tax returns.

Finally, it’s worth noting two developments that limit the usefulness of the state’s data in drawing conclusions about the business tax climate.

No. 1: It’s common now for start-up businesses to form as partnerships instead of ""C"" corporations. So part the picture is missing, because the state does not pull out tax-payment data on these firms, many of which are small. State revenue officials still say their data on ""C"" corporations is worthwhile, given the large dollars at stake.

No. 2: A relatively new change called ""combined reporting"" could increase corporate tax revenue collections in the years ahead. No data is yet available on that, however.

What’s the bottom line?

The liberal Institute for One Wisconsin used state data to assert that two-thirds of Wisconsin corporations pay no state income taxes. The two-thirds number is solid, the trend is long-term and it is reflected by federal tax data as well.

For some corporations, tax breaks reduce the bottom line to zero in tax liability. But the group failed to note that some share of those non-paying businesses simply don’t make enough to pay taxes. We can’t say how significant that detail is because the data doesn’t exist.

Illegal immigrants hurt hospital's bottom line, Georgia senator says
","
A Georgia state senator recently shared some distressing news about one of metro Atlanta’s largest hospital systems.

""Gwinnett Medical Center is operating in the negative,"" Renee Unterman, who represents a portion of Gwinnett County, said in a speech on the Senate floor.

""And one of the reasons they are is because people are not paying their bills, and that includes illegal immigrants,"" she said.

Unterman, a Republican, was making a speech in support of House Bill 87, legislation aimed at reducing illegal immigration in Georgia. The Senate, largely along party lines, voted in favor of the bill, which Gov. Nathan Deal has said he will sign into law. The former nurse said some people in her district complained to her that they couldn’t get inside the hospital’s emergency room because it is often filled with illegal immigrants.

We wondered whether Unterman was correct about her claim. Gwinnett Medical Center spokeswoman Beth Okun confirmed that it had a negative operating margin so far this fiscal year, which ends June 30, by nearly $7 million. That’s about 2 percent of the system’s annual budget.

Gwinnett Medical Center, Unterman said, had been in the black for several years beforehand.

So why is Gwinnett Medical Center, which has medical facilities in Lawrenceville and Duluth, in financial trouble this fiscal year? Are illegal immigrants partially to blame for the red ink?

Indigent care costs at Gwinnett Medical Center, which includes Medicare and Medicaid, have nearly quadrupled since 2000, according to our review of the center’s annual reports.

Gwinnett Medical Center has a $20 million funding gap for Medicare reimbursements, Okun said to explain some of the shortfall. The center is receiving 80 cents in Medicare reimbursements for every dollar it spends on care for Medicare recipients, Okun said. Georgia Hospital Association spokesman Kevin Bloye said more Georgians are losing their health insurance, and hospitals are treating a larger percentage of uninsured patients, which likely includes illegal immigrants.

Okun noted other financial problems. Gwinnett Medical Center is also short $1.1 million due to the provider fee, also known as the ""bed tax,"" passed by state lawmakers in 2010.

Gwinnett Medical Center has balanced its books, Okun said, by cutting some expenses and seeing an increase in its investment income. The hospital system cut 160 positions in November. Officials have stressed Gwinnett Medical Center is not in long-term financial danger.

So is Unterman right about this funding shortage being the result, in part, of illegal immigrants without health insurance flooding the ER? There’s no clear way to answer that question, Okun and others said.

Okun said the hospital system does not ask patients their immigration status.

""The problem is we can’t quantify it,"" Bloye said. ""Hospitals don’t ask patients whether they are legal or illegal.""

Georgia has an estimated 425,000 illegal immigrants, according to a February study by the Pew Hispanic Center, whose figures on such topics are widely accepted by political leaders and some government officials. That estimate accounts for about 4.4 percent of Georgia’s 9.7 million residents. The study does not estimate how much Georgia spends on health care for illegal immigrants.

Research on the topic is scant. A 2006 report on immigrant health care costs in Los Angeles County by the RAND Corp., a nonprofit research organization, found per capita spending in a one-year period on illegal immigrant men and women was 39 percent and 54 percent, respectively, of native-born residents. The study also found illegal immigrants there made fewer visits to the doctor because they considered themselves in better health and had less access to health care.

The Federation for American Immigration Reform, whose data is frequently used by some Georgia lawmakers, released a report in July and revised it in February that found Georgia spends more than $317 million a year on medical care for illegal immigrants. Those costs include Medicaid, the state’s children's health insurance program, PeachCare, and emergency childbirth. Georgia spends about $1.4 billion a year on Medicaid and PeachCare, state officials say. If both numbers are correct, illegal immigrants account for 22 percent of such costs.

FAIR included U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, but the Constitution guarantees citizenship to any child born in this country. Some organizations have accused FAIR of xenophobia. The Washington, D.C.-based organization has been critical of the federal government’s efforts to halt illegal immigrants from working inside the U.S.  

Unterman noted in her speech to lawmakers that the federal Hill-Burton Act, which requires some health care facilities to provide free or reduced care if a patient can’t afford it, does not require U.S. citizenship for eligibility. It does, however, maintain that a recipient must have lived in the United States for at least three months.

The senator said Philip Wolfe, the chief executive officer of the Gwinnett Medical Center, explained some of its financial problems before this year’s legislative session began. Unterman told us she did not have scientific research about the financial impact of illegal immigrants on Gwinnett Medical Center, but she said she believes there is a significant impact by some of the calls she has received from people in her district.

""I think it’s pretty serious when you get calls from your constituents,"" Unterman told us.

We found that Unterman was correct about Gwinnett Medical Center’s troubled finances for the current budget year. The senator could also be right about illegal immigrants being part of the reason why the center is ""in the negative.""

But there are no concrete numbers on how much illegal immigrants are costing the center. They could be a major burden to its finances or a minor blip on the spreadsheet. Under current reporting requirements, the numbers just aren’t verifiable.

Without that additional information, we rate Unterman’s claim as Half True.",/factchecks/2011/may/11/renee-unterman/illegal-immigrants-hurt-hospitals-bottom-line-geor/
