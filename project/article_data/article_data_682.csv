STD spending is in the economic stimulus plan
","Republicans have large philosophical differences with the $819 billion economic stimulus package that passed the House on Jan. 28, 2009, and they have tried to discredit the plan by singling out relatively small spending proposals they see as inappropriate. One of the most widely cited claims from Republican leaders has been that the stimulus plan includes millions for sexually transmitted disease education. On the day of the the House vote, the National Republican Congressional Committee circulated a news release in the districts of 29 freshman House Democrats, chastising them for supporting a massive spending plan that the NRCC said includes $335 million for sexually transmitted disease prevention programs.   A version of the news release circulating in Florida, for example, begins, ""Rep. Alan Grayson (FL-08) and Rep. Suzanne Kosmas (FL-24) are set to cast their vote today on a so-called 'stimulus' package, which has shattered the trillion dollar mark. The question is: Will Alan Grayson and Suzanne Kosmas still support the massive spending bill now that it has become public that the House Democrats' so-called 'stimulus' has been stuffed with an astonishing $335 million to fund prevention programs of sexually transmitted diseases?""   Rep. Eric Cantor, the House Republican whip, had been making the same point for days, including in an interview with Fox News on Jan. 23. But the STD spending issue gained considerable momentum as a Republican attack after the Drudge Report posted an alert about it at the top of its popular political Web page on Jan. 28. So is there really STD prevention spending in the stimulus bill passed by House Democrats on Jan. 28? Yes, there is.     In a section of the plan that includes funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the bill states that ""not less than $335,000,000 shall be used as an additional amount to carry out domestic HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, sexually-transmitted diseases, and tuberculosis prevention programs, as jointly determined by the Secretary and the Director.""     In an interview on CBS's  Early Show  on Jan. 29, the day after the House passed the stimulus package, anchor Maggie Rodriguez asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi how $335 million in STD prevention would stimulate the economy.     Said Pelosi: ""I'll tell you how. ... I'm a big believer in prevention. And we have — there's a part of the bill, on the health side of it, that is about prevention. It's about it being less expensive to the states to do these prevention measures.""     We note that while the NRCC news release specifically calls out House Democrats for the STD spending, the Senate version of the bill also includes it — in fact, slightly more. A portion of the stimulus plan approved by the Senate Appropriations committee on Jan. 27 states that ""not less than $400,000,000 shall be transferred to the CDC for an additional amount for the screening and prevention of sexually-transmitted diseases, including HIV.""      A committee report on the bill backs up the HIV and STD prevention spending with this analysis: ""CDC estimates that approximately 19 million new STD infections occur annually in the United States, with 1 in 4 teenage girls currently infected. This epidemic is estimated to cost the U.S. healthcare system $15,000,000,000 annually, all of which is preventable. The Committee has included $400,000,000 for testing and prevention of these conditions. The Committee intends that funds be used for grants to States for testing activities, and the prevention of STD infections like chlamydia that have been increasing dramatically in recent years."" We're not going to wade into the debate over whether the spending is appropriate for an economic stimulus bill. We're only ruling on whether there is $335 million in the House version of the bill for STD prevention programs. We note that while the proposed $335 million in the House bill includes prevention programs for STDs, it also includes prevention programs HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis prevention programs, which are not always transmitted sexually. So we find the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2009/jan/29/national-republican-congressional-committee/std-spending-economic-stimulus-plan/

Obama says Chicago schools never close for snow
","
A veteran of many frosty winters in the Windy City, President Obama was incredulous to find out that classes at his daughters' new schools in Washington, D.C., had been canceled due to icy road conditions.


""Can I make a comment that is unrelated to the economy very quickly?"" Obama told reporters in a light moment at a gathering with business leaders on Jan. 28. ""And it has to do with Washington. My children's school was canceled today. Because of, what? Some ice?""


""As my children pointed out, in Chicago, school is never canceled,"" Obama said. ""In fact, my 7-year-old pointed out that (during a winter storm) you'd go outside for recess. You wouldn't even stay indoors. So, I don't know. We're going to have to try to apply some flinty Chicago toughness.""


According to an AP report, Obama was asked if he meant the people of the national's capital are wimps, to which Obama responded: ""I'm saying, when it comes to the weather, folks in Washington don't seem to be able to handle things.""
 
Chicago gets an average of about 3 feet of snow a year. Is it possible they don't need snow days?
 
Turns out it's been 10 years.
 
""The last time we had a snow day was on Jan. 4 and 5 of 1999,"" said Malon Edwards, spokesman for the Chicago Public Schools.
 
That's when the Windy City got socked with 22 inches of snow, at the time the second-largest snowstorm in Chicago history.
 
""We very rarely cancel for snow days.""
 
In mid January of this year, when temperatures dipped into negative numbers (sans wind chill), the school district told parents if they felt it was unsafe to send their kids to school that day, it'd be okay to keep them at home. But school stayed open.
 
We should note that D.C. public schools weren't actually closed on Jan. 28. They opened two hours late. But Obama's daughters, Malia and Sasha, attend the private Sidwell Friends School, which canceled classes. Most school districts in the Washington suburbs also closed.
 
Obama is right that snow days are amazingly rare in Chicago — there haven't been any in the last decade — but we'll cruelly ding him for saying ""never."" Mostly True.

Mica correct roads and bridges are small part of stimulus
","In making their case for the economic stimulus bill, President Obama and Democrats in Congress have been saying the bill will make an investment in the nation's infrastructure similar to President Eisenhower's creation of the interstate highway system in the 1950s.   When Obama gave an initial outline of the stimulus plan in a radio/YouTube address on Dec. 6, 2008, he said it would include a significant investment in the highway system.   ""We will create millions of jobs by making the single largest new investment in our national infrastructure since the creation of the federal highway system in the 1950s,"" he said, referring to the interstate system launched by President Eisenhower. ""We’ll invest your precious tax dollars in new and smarter ways, and we’ll set a rule — use it or lose it. If a state doesn’t act quickly to invest in roads and bridges in their communities, they’ll lose the money."" Obama also invoked Eisenhower during a Dec. 19, 2008, news conference in Chicago: ""Our economy boomed in the 20th century when President Eisenhower remade the American landscape by building the interstate highway system. Now we need to remake our transportation system for the 21st century."" The Ike comparisons have irked Rep. John Mica of Florida, the top Republican on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. In a comment to the  Washington Post  published Jan. 28, 2009, Mica complained that the highway portion of the stimulus was small change compared with the cost of the 1950s program. Mica said the proposed infrastructure spending was ""almost minuscule"" in the $825 billion stimulus bill and said he was disappointed the transportation portion was not based on an ambitious goal such as building high-speed rail lines. ""They keep comparing this to Eisenhower, but he proposed a $500 billion highway system, and they're going to put $30 billion"" in roads and bridges, Mica said. ""How farcical can you be? Give me a break."" So let's check Mica's numbers. First, Mica is correct that the highway portion of the stimulus is $30 billion, according to the House Appropriations Committee summary of the bill. As for the Eisenhower system, the number went up as the system grew. When Ike proposed the program in 1955, he wrote Congress that, ""Our unity as a nation is secured by free communication of thought and by easy transportation of people and goods."" (The  original letter  provided to reporters gives an entertaining glimpse into White House press relations 50 years go. It is typed on a manual typewriter and tells reporters that it ""MUST BE HELD IN STRICT CONFIDENCE and no portion, synopsis or intimation may be given out or published UNTIL RELEASE TIME."") Eisenhower estimated the interstate portion of his plan would cost $25 billion over 10 years ($198 billion in today's dollars). That's significantly lower than the number Mica cited, even in current dollars. But the ultimate cost is in line with what Mica said: The total cost is now roughly $445 billion in today's dollars, according to a 1996 report for the American Highway Users Alliance.  Another estimate  , on the Web site What it Costs.com, puts the number right at $500 billion. So Mica is right on the $30 billion for the current stimulus bill, but the $500 billion interstate cost he cites is the ultimate cost, not the original proposal from Eisenhower. His underlying point is still correct, however, that the highway portion of the stimulus bill is small compared with Ike's plan. So we find his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2009/jan/28/john-mica/mica-correct-roads-and-bridges-are-small-part-stim/

Cantor says more in stimulus for Washington grass than small businesses
","One of the most popular punching bags for Republican leaders critical of spending in the Democratic-led $835 billion economic stimulus bill   has been new turf for the National Mall in Washington, D.C.   Rep. Eric Cantor, the House Republican whip, cited the turf in an interview with Fox News on Jan. 23, 2009.   ""If you look at the bill that passed the Ways and Means Committee yesterday, for every dollar that is spent to help small businesses, $4 is being spent to help upkeep the grass on the lawns of Washington,"" Cantor said. So there's two sides to this equation: the amount of the money in the plan to help small businesses versus the amount to ""upkeep the grass on the lawns of Washington.""   Let's start with the grass. Cantor is referring to $200 million   in the stimulus plan for revitalizing the National Mall, the sprawling grassy park and gravel walkway that links the Capitol with the Smithsonian museums, the Washington Monument, and the Jefferson and Lincoln memorials.   The Mall, which gets more than 25 million visitors a year, is in serious disrepair. Perhaps most dire is that the sea walls next to the Jefferson Memorial are slowly collapsing into the Tidal Basin and need to be repaired, said Kirstin Brost, a spokeswoman for the Democratic chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. According to stories in the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post and Newsweek, much of the Mall's underground sprinkler system doesn’t work, reflecting pools are cloudy with muck, the oldest structure on the Mall has missing and boarded-up windows, and yes, the lawn has been trampled brown in many places.   ""The Mall is just in bad shape,"" Brost said. ""To laugh it off as replacing grass, it's not appreciating the fact that the place that holds our national treasures is in severe disrepair."" The House bill states that the money would be used for ""construction, improvements, repair or replacement of facilities related to … the National Mall.""   Although the bill doesn't contain specific numbers, a ""discussion draft"" of the package considered by the House provides a little more detail. It says the ""many"" projects that would be funded in the Mall project include ""repair of the Jefferson Memorial’s collapsing Tidal Basin walls and the replacement of mall turf.""   In order to make his equation work, Cantor assumes all of $200 million is for the new turf. It's not. In reality, only a small portion of the $200 million would be for new turf, Brost said. ""It's one of a lot of things that need to get done.""   Okay, how about the other side of Cantor's equation, the part about help for small businesses? Cantor spokesman Brad Dayspring said the stimulus package in the House only includes $41 million in ""direct"" benefit to small businesses. He referred us to a line in a Joint Committee of Taxation revenue table for the stimulus bill that lists a tax provision ""Temporary increase in limitation on expensing of certain depreciable business assets."" But they are taking a very narrow approach in estimating how long that benefit would last. They are assuming it would end in 2010 because that law and many other tax provisions expire that year. But they're ignoring the likelihood that Congress will extend it, said Keith Ashdown, a spokesman for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that tracks government spending. ""This is a very popular provision supported by both parties,"" Ashdown said, and so it's very likely to continue after two years.   Brost, the spokeswoman for the Appropriations Chairman David Obey, D-Wis., said Cantor's equation also ignores other provisions   in the stimulus package that could help small businesses, even if they are not the sole beneficiary.   Among them: •    $430 million in loan guarantees and other incentives to free up capital and make lenders more willing to loan money.   •    $100 million for grants and loans to guarantee $2 billion in lending for rural businesses. •    $100 million, including $70 million for the Technology Innovation Program, to accelerate research in technologies with high job growth potential, and $30 million for the Manufacturing Extension Partnerships to help small and midsize manufacturers compete globally by providing them with access to technology. •     $250 million in grants to address long-term economic distress in urban industrial cores and rural areas. It is distributed based on need and ability to create jobs and attract private investment. Although it would be inaccurate to tally all of these and count them as direct assistance to small businesses, it is fair to say that many small businesses would benefit from these $880 million in programs, Ashdown said. In addition to these provisions, Brost said, small businesses will surely benefit from the many infrastructure projects the plan proposes. We're not taking sides about whether it's proper for the National Mall improvements to be included in the stimulus bill. But Cantor's rhetoric is inflated. He says the money would help ""the lawns of Washington,"" which suggests it might go to homeowners when it is really for a sprawling public park. And both sides of Cantor's equation are flawed. The plan does not call for $200 million worth of new grass for the National Mall, and we think there's clearly more than $41 million in help to small businesses. Cantor has grossly distorted the numbers to make a point about the need for more small business benefits. We rule his statement False.",/factchecks/2009/jan/27/eric-cantor/cantor-says-more-stimulus-washinton-grass-small-bu/

Does the stimulus package really include $300,000 for a sculpture garden?
","As part of their attack on the Democratic-led $835 billion economic stimulus package, some Republicans have attempted to discredit the plan by singling out examples of what they consider the most outrageous spending.   In an interview with Fox News on Jan. 23, 2009, Virginia Rep. Eric Cantor, the House Republican whip, said that in a meeting with President Obama, Cantor asked if he ""could use his influence on this process to try and get the pork barrel spending out of the bill. I mean, there's $300,000 for a sculpture garden in Miami.""   But do a word search on ""sculpture"" in the 647-page stimulus bill now before the House and you'll come up blank. It's not in there.   So we asked Cantor's office where he came up with it.   Here's how spokesman Neil Bradley explained it: The House stimulus bill includes $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts. The bill states that the money would be ""distributed in direct grants to fund arts projects and activities which preserve jobs in the nonprofit arts sector threatened by declines in philanthropic and other support during the current economic downturn.""   It's the lack of detail that particularly bothers Cantor, Bradley said.   ""We don't know what they're going to spend it on,"" Bradley said. ""There is no direction to the NEA on how to spend it.""   So to give people an idea of how the NEA spends its money, Cantor's staff looked at some recent grants awarded by the NEA.   And in 2008, the NEA gave $300,000 to the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens in Miami to restore an outdoor statuary. The Vizcaya estate is one of the country's most intact remaining examples from the American Renaissance, a period when the very wealthy built estates to look European. The $300,000 grant was to help restore some of the outdoor sculptures — statues, urns and fountains — that had been severely deteriorating due to South Florida's salty, damp and subtropical climate, not to mention the hurricanes.   But again, this was an NEA grant from  last year  . It is not in the proposed $835 billion stimulus package that is being pushed by President Obama and congressional Democrats. In fact, because the sculpture garden's money has already been granted, it's probably safe to say that this is one project that specifically  won’t  be part of the spending.   We get the Cantor camp's argument that there are no specific projects tied to the funding in the proposed NEA allotment. When all is said and done, there may very well be plenty of NEA projects that some find objectionable or wasteful. This just isn't one of them.   Kirstin Brost, a spokeswoman for Rep. Dave Obey, D-Wis., House Appropriations Committee chairman, defended the proposed funding to the NEA.   ""Artists need jobs just like everyone else,"" Brost said. ""Fifty million out of $825 billion doesn't seem like an extreme amount to support our artists.""   The bottom line here is that Cantor specifically identified the sculpture garden as part of the stimulus package when it just isn't — which his staff acknowledges. And he has made that false claim repeatedly. He was quoted saying something similar in a Richmond newspaper. That's not just sculpting the facts. That's Pants on Fire wrong.",/factchecks/2009/jan/27/eric-cantor/does-stimulus-package-really-include-300000-sculpt/

Obama's numbers on lost income require explanation
","President Obama argued forcefully for an economic stimulus bill in his weekly radio and YouTube address on Jan. 24, 2009. ""We begin this year and this administration in the midst of an unprecedented crisis that calls for unprecedented action,"" Obama said. ""Just this week, we saw more people file for unemployment than at any time in the last 26 years, and experts agree that if nothing is done, the unemployment rate could reach double digits. Our economy could fall $1 trillion short of its full capacity, which translates into more than $12,000 in lost income for a family of four."" We've heard lots of big numbers about the recession, but we were especially interested in whether a family of four would lose $12,000 in income. Let's start with the $1 trillion number. For numbers on the economy, we turned to the Congressional Budget Office, the federal agency charged with providing objective, nonpartisan analysis to Congress. Its most recent report, issued on Jan. 8, 2009, found that economic output could fall 6.8 percent below its potential. For the roughly $14.2 trillion economy projected for 2009, an unrealized potential of 6.8 percent does come out to about $1 trillion. Now how does that translate for a family of four? As near as we can tell, Obama took the $1 trillion and divided by 300 million — the number of people who live in the United States. That comes to $3,333 per person. Multiply it by four and you get $13,333, or a conservative $12,000. Now, we can't say for sure that's how Obama arrived at his number for wages. We asked the press office about it and didn't hear back. (In their defense, they have reportedly been having  e-mail trouble  .) It's certainly possible Obama used a more sophisticated analysis to determine unrealized wages. But the economists we talked to said no matter how Obama determined the number for a family of four, any average oversimplifies how economic downturns affect the public. Some family members, for example, will see no drop in their wages, or might even get new jobs that increase their income. For other families, it will be much, much worse. ""It makes it sound like everybody's income goes down by $12,000,"" said Bob Williams, of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ""That's just not true. It never gets spread out like that."" ""If Bill Gates walks into a bar, then you can say, on average, everyone in that bar is a millionaire,"" Williams said. ""That doesn't mean there's more than one millionaire in the bar."" Another economist, Russell Roberts of George Mason University, agreed, saying the hardest hit will be the unemployed. ""The average loss of $12,000 is a weird number,"" Roberts said. ""Some families will face tough times. Others much less so."" Roberts, a market-oriented economist who has questioned the effectiveness of the stimulus plan, also pointed out that the $1 trillion number is nothing more than a projection. ""Yes, the economy could underperform by a trillion dollars. Or two. Or three. No one knows,"" he said. We recognize his point, but we looked at this statement more to see if Obama was exaggerating his numbers to make a case for the stimulus. Yes, the numbers are in line with a widely accepted nonpartisan source. But in trying to personalize the numbers for families, he takes things a step too far and oversimplifies. Many viewers and listeners might think most families will lose about $12,000 in income. Realistically, they will probably do much better or much worse than that. For that reason, we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2009/jan/26/barack-obama/obama-numbers-income-explanation/

Barton correct that Congress getting little review of economic stimulus package
","When Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, complained this week that Democrats were ramming the proposed $835 billion economic stimulus package too quickly through Congress, he was hardly charting new territory as far as minority party gripes.   The ""you're not giving us reasonable time to debate this important legislation"" is a well-worn minority party refrain.   But we wondered whether Barton was accurate when he said the House Energy and Commerce Committee has not — and will not — hold a single hearing on a major portion of the $850 billion stimulus plan that came before it.   Here's what Barton said on Jan. 22: ""While I understand the majority’s desire to move quickly on the stimulus package, I think the short leash that the speaker has put us on restricts our ability to write competent legislation. We have not had a single hearing on anything in front of us, meaning that the only opinion we’ve heard on the expenditure of billions of dollars is that of the speaker. We’ve been told that even one hearing would be one too many, and that we have a single day to approve these five complex propositions that will affect the lives of millions. That’s because the speaker wants the entire stimulus package on the House floor next week.     “By my count, in front of us are 269 pages of text. I have not yet seen the most recent CBO score, but suffice it to say that these 269 pages approve the spending of hundreds of billions of dollars. Will this package of legislation waste money? Will it abuse people? Will it raise a dust cloud of unintended and unhappy consequences? Will we be embarrassed by some of what we approve here today? The answer is yes, yes, yes and yes.""   The portion of the stimulus plan that came before Energy and Commerce Committee includes about $170 billion in proposed spending.   No one challenges the claim that the massive spending bill is being fast-tracked.   At a congressional forum on Jan. 7, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi explained the urgency this way: ""Nothing could be clearer than the fact that we need action and we need action now. A failure to act quickly can only lead to more job losses and more economic pain for Americans. If we act boldly and rapidly, we can begin to create new jobs and opportunities today and strengthen our economy, as you said, for the long run.""   President Obama has said he wants to have the package approved by mid February.   Republicans have cried foul, saying there has been little effort by Democrats to craft a bipartisan package, and that they only received a draft of the proposal on Jan. 16. Less than a week later, the plan came before the House Appropriations, Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce committees,  for one day of ""markups."" That means committee members can propose amendments.   On Jan. 22, Barton's Energy and Commerce Committee, on which he is the senior Republican, held a marathon 12-hour ""markup"" session during which numerous amendments were added to the proposal. The fate of amendments largely depended on which side of the aisle the suggestions came from, as nearly all of the dozens of Republican-backed amendments were rejected.   Don Ritchie, associate historian of the Senate Historical Office, said while congressional committees are typically permitted hearings on major spending plans, ""when there's an emergency, they tend not to go along in regular order. ... When the leadership of both houses agrees it's important enough to circumvent, then they'll go around the regular order.""   The minority party almost always objects, he said, but both parties have done it when they control the majority.   ""It's not unprecedented by any means,"" Ritchie said of bypassing hearings. But it is unusual for such a large spending plan.   ""There hasn't been anything of that magnitude in a long time,"" Ritchie said. ""That stands out by itself, I think.""   Barton used words like ""abomination"" and ""truly an insult"" to describe the fast-tracking of the plan.   By way of explaining the need for a streamlined review, Committee Chairman Rep. Henry A. Waxman said, ""We are in a deep and long recession. Our unemployment rate is over 7 percent and growing. We urgently need an economic recovery package — and we need it immediately.""   On Jan. 23, Obama met with Republican leadership to get their input on the proposed stimulus package; and he agreed to meet with the Republican caucuses this week, though many Republicans scoffed at the suggestion it will result in anything close to a bipartisan plan.   One can argue whether the urgency of the economic crisis outweighs the need for deliberate consideration through congressional hearings, but Barton is right: There have been no hearings on the massive stimulus package that Congress is expected to vote on as early as this week.

Cantor distorts CBO data on stimulus package
","In the debate over how best to provide economic stimulus, put U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor, the Republican whip, in the camp that thinks more tax cuts and less government spending is the way to go.   Fair enough. But in a Jan. 21, 2009, interview on Fox News, Cantor cited a recent report from the Congressional Budget Office to back up his argument.   ""We have a list of ideas very focused on small businesses, the self-employed, entrepreneurs and families, because we believe very much you provide tax relief to those individuals that we will see an economy that bounces back,"" Cantor said.   ""Unfortunately, here on the Hill, what we're seeing now is the congressional Democrats proposed massive amounts of spending; that in fact today the Congressional Budget Office came out with a report — said that it's just not stimulus. It won't help the economy grow."" That seemed odd, given that the CBO is supposed to be an objective, nonpartisan fiscal research arm for Congress. So we decided to check it out. What Cantor cited is not so much a CBO report as a data run projecting how much of the proposed $355 billion stimulus money proposed by House Democrats for infrastructure projects like bridge, highway or school construction and other ""discretionary"" spending would be going out the door in any given year. Because while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi talks about ""shovel ready"" projects, the reality is many of the proposed projects would take time to get off the ground. The CBO analysis found that about $136 billion of the $355 billion total would be spent in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 (remember, we are already 4-1/2 months into the 2009 fiscal year). So that means only about a third would be spent this year and next. By the end of the 2011 fiscal year, about 70 percent of the money would be spent. When we called Cantor's office, they made the point that the CBO data show that the proposed spending by the Democrats wouldn't be spent fast enough to quickly stimulate the faltering economy. They note that a previous CBO report projected a marked contraction in the U.S. economy in 2009 will be followed by a slow recovery in 2010. Therefore, Cantor and other Republicans have argued, the bulk of the infrastructure spending wouldn't kick in until we are already well out of a recession. ""If most of the plan won't be spent before 2011, what help is that to the economy now?"" said Cantor spokesman Brad Dayspring. Therefore, he said, it's fair to extrapolate from the data that the Democrats' plan won't help the economy. A few caveats to the CBO spending analysis are in order. First, as Cantor acknowledged later in the Fox interview, the CBO analysis referenced by Cantor only looked at so-called discretionary spending, not the entire $825 billion stimulus package proposed by House leaders. Among the spending not analyzed is a proposed $275 billion in tax cuts and nearly $200 billion for jobless benefits — both of which are expected by some to jump-start the economy more quickly than infrastructure projects. Second, the CBO data is based on an already outdated version of the proposed stimulus package. Last, and perhaps most important, the three-page CBO data sheet makes absolutely no qualitative conclusions about whether infrastructure spending will stimulate the economy, or whether it will or won't help the economy to grow. It projects when the money would be spent, period. There is sure to be heated debate between Democrats and Republicans in the coming weeks about spending versus tax cuts in the proposed stimulus package, and which would create more jobs, more quickly. If Cantor's point is that Democrats have been too optimistic in how quickly they can create jobs through infrastructure projects, the CBO data give a bit of ammunition to suggest that such projects will likely take several years to unfold. But the way Cantor said it suggests that the nonpartisan and well-regarded CBO had come out with a report that said the opposition party's proposal wouldn't work. That's a serious distortion of three pages of data that simply laid out a likely timeline of spending. Yes, coupled with other data, it is possible to make an argument that the proposed infrastructure spending won't provide an urgently needed boost to the ecomony, but that's not an argument the CBO weighs in on one way or another. And Cantor's suggestion that it does is False.",/factchecks/2009/jan/23/eric-cantor/Cantor-distorts-CBO-data/

$5 trillion added to national debt under Bush
","We know the public debt has grown dramatically during the past eight years. Rahm Emanuel, Barack Obama's White House chief of staff, pegged the increase at $4 trillion recently. Emanuel appeared on  Meet the Press  the Sunday before Obama took office and was asked about Obama's spending plans and whether he was concerned about adding even more to the national debt. Emanuel began by pointing out that the national debt increased significantly during the Bush administration, then he defended the need for a stimulus bill to help the economy. ""Actually, there was a surplus at one time, and now we've added, in the last eight years, $4 trillion of debt to the nation's obligations,"" Emanuel said. Emanuel was actually using two different ways of talking about the budget. We'll explain. The federal government creates a budget every year. When it spends more money than it takes in, it runs a deficit. When tax revenues run higher than expenses, that's a budget surplus. At the end of the Clinton administration, there were several years of budget surpluses. But those surpluses were not enough to compensate for the previous deficit years. So the government still carried what's called the national debt. (For more detail on these concepts, check out this  ""Frequently Asked Questions about the Public Debt""  Web page put together by the Treasury Department.) Here, we wanted to look at Emanuel's claim that during the past eight years we've added $4 trillion to the national debt. Is it that much? Turns out, it's even more than that. Emanuel didn't mention the Bush administration specifically, but that's what most people think of when they think of the last eight years. So we decided to check the national debt from when Bush took office to when he left. When Bush took office, the national debt was $5.73 trillion. When he left, it was $10.7 trillion. That's a difference of $4.97 trillion, almost $1 trillion more than what Emanuel said. But the debt has shot up significantly during the past few months, mostly due to the economic meltdown of 2008 and the government's efforts to shore up the federal banking system. As recently as Sept. 18, 2008, Emanuel would have been correct with the $4 trillion number. You can check out all these numbers for yourself via the  Treasury Department's debt history search application  . So what does the Truth-O-Meter say when someone is off by $1 trillion? As we've said with  our policy on statistical claims  , ""to assess the truth for a numbers claim, the biggest factor is the underlying message."" So even though he is off by about 20 percent, the fact that the number has been surging lately supports his point that the debt increased greatly under Bush. So we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2009/jan/22/rahm-emanuel/5-trillion-added-national-debt-under-bush/

Statement from Reid and Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, Jan. 13, 2009

 
So how did embattled Roland Burris, Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich's pick to replace Barack Obama, go from being what Reid described as a ""tainted appointment"" to ""colleague and a friend""?
 
Suffice to say some things changed in the two weeks between these statements.
 
The first statement came from Reid and the Democratic caucus after Blagojevich defiantly appointed Burris despite charges from federal prosecutors that he had tried to trade the seat for personal gain. Although there was no suggestion that Burris was ever involved in Blagojevich's scheme, Reid and other Senate Democratic leaders said they considered any appointment from Blagojevich ""tainted"" and vowed to block it.
 
Reid explained the Senate Democrats' initial hard line in a news conference on Jan. 7:
 
""The reason Barack Obama joined with us in the first letter and certainly the statements made subsequent to that, that this nomination is tainted, because if you know anything about this, it doesn't look very good.""
 
Reid cited comments that federal prosecutors have alleged Blagojevich used, saying the Senate would be ""an ‘effin gold mine, I've got to get anything I can out of it.""
 
""How are we supposed to react? We reacted in a very reasonable way,"" Reid said.
 
But Reid quickly began to soften his stance a few days later.
 
In a

Meet the Press

interview on Jan. 4, host David Gregory asked if there was ""room here to negotiate and actually seat Burris."" Reid responded, ""I'm an old trial lawyer. There's always room to negotiate.""
 
Legally, a few things fell Burris' way. For one, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that the appointment was valid. Senate Democratic leaders had initially pinned some of their legal opposition to the Burris appointment on the fact that Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White had not signed off on the appointment, but that fizzled when White wrote a letter validating the appointment.
 
In addition, Burris appeared before the Illinois House Committee on Impeachment and testified that he had never offered Blogojevich anything in return for his appointment.
 
Also, Senate Democratic leaders found themselves facing mounting pressure from other Democrats, particularly the Congressional Black Caucus, to seat Burris.
 
Senate Democratic leadership relented and eventually backed Burris. He was sworn in on Jan. 15 and, like Obama was, will be the only African-American serving in the U.S. Senate.
 
""There are many paths to the United States Senate,"" Reid said from the floor on Jan. 15. ""It is fair to say that the path that brought our new colleague from Illinois to us was unique. . . . Senator Burris, on behalf of all senators, we welcome you as a colleague and a friend.""
 
Whether political pressure, a realization of legal inevitability or the change in Burris credentials was the tipping point, the fact is that Reid and other Senate Democratic leaders drew a line in the sand and then, two weeks later, crossed it.
 
It's such a reversal that it's a safe bet that video clips of Reid's earlier statements will be used in Republican TV ads when the Burris seat comes up for election in 2010. On the Flip-O-Meter, we call that a Full Flop.

The legend of slaves building Capitol is correct
","Every now and then, a fact goes viral. Current case in point: that slaves helped construct the U.S. Capitol, where the son of an African man is set to be sworn in as the nation's 44th president.

Pundits and politicians have mentioned this dozens of times in the past few days, wielding it as potent shorthand for all the historical import of the moment.

Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, mentioned it in her remarks at the Dec. 2, 2008, dedication of the Capitol Visitors Center:

""The Capitol was built by slaves,"" Pelosi said. ""Today, I want to talk about the fact that it's so appropriate that, though long overdue, this Capitol Visitors Center is ready for 2009, which is the 200th anniversary, the bicentennial of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, the great emancipator.""

We wanted to find the details behind the assertion and give it more context.

It turns out there's far less in the historical record on the subject than one might expect. Early historians of the Capitol's construction were largely indifferent to the work of common laborers, both paid and slave. Records from the time are spotty.

Only in the past 15 years or so has attention been trained on the role slaves played in constructing perhaps the nation's most important building — and the work has been led not by professional historians, but by individuals who developed a personal interest in the subject, such as retired Washington television reporter Ed Hotaling and freelance writer Bob Arnebeck.

In 2005, Congress appointed a task force to research the subject, which issued a report in conjunction with the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, finally bringing a measure of scholarly rigor to bear on the topic.

The task force acknowledged it was not able to tell the full story. ""No one will ever know how many slaves helped to build the United States Capitol Building — or the White House,"" says the 2005 task force report, entitled  History of Slave Laborers in the Construction of the United States Capitol. 

But the task force did find plenty of evidence of slave involvement in the Capitol's construction. Perhaps the most compelling evidence were records of payments from the commissioners for the District of Columbia — the three men appointed by George Washington to oversee the construction of the Capitol and the rest of the city of Washington — to slave owners for the rental of slaves to work on the Capitol. The records reflect 385 payments between 1795 and 1801 for ""Negro hire,"" a euphemism for the yearly rental of slaves.

Slaves were likely involved in all aspects of construction, including carpentry, masonry, carting, rafting, plastering, glazing and painting, the task force reported. And slaves appear to have shouldered alone the grueling work of sawing logs and stones.

Slave crews also toiled at the marble and sandstone quarries that provided the stone to face the structure — lonely, grueling work with bleak living conditions in rural Virginia and elsewhere. ""Keep the yearly hirelings at work from sunrise to sunset — particularly the Negroes,"" the commissioners wrote to quarry operator William O'Neale in 1794.

The commissioners' use of slave labor was unremarkable for the time. When the Capitol was constructed, from 1793 to 1826, the building trades in almost every colony augmented the work force with slave labor. This would have been especially true in the Potomac region — the home of about half the 750,000 African-Americans living in the United States, according to the 1972 book  Free Negroes in the District of Columbia,  by Letitia Woods Brown.

Most of the slaves who worked on the Capitol are known by first name at best — the records refer to a payment of $13.00 to slaveholder Teresa Bent for ""Nace,"" for example, and $23.00 to Elizabeth Brent for ""Harry"" and ""Gabe.""

But one particular slave, Philip Reid, achieved some renown as an individual. He was a slave laborer for Clark Mills, who was hired to cast the Statue of Freedom, the Capitol's crowning feature. The government paid Reid $1.25 a day for his work.

The statue, a draped female figure holding a sheathed sword in one hand and a laurel wreath in the other, stands atop the Capitol dome, 288 feet above the site of Obama's swearing in.

Pelosi might have specified that slaves were only part of the work force, but they were involved with almost every aspect of construction for at least the first several years. We find her statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2da6e075-066e-45e7-a519-4da507b38695",/factchecks/2009/jan/20/nancy-pelosi/legend-slaves-building-capitol-correct/

Statement from Reid and Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, Jan. 13, 2009

 
So how did embattled Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich’s pick to fill Barack Obama’s vacated Senate seat go from — in Reid’s words — a “tainted appointment” to one welcomed to the Senate as a “colleague and a friend""? Suffice to say some things changed in the two weeks between these statements.

“The reason Barack Obama joined with us in the first letter and certainly the statements made subsequent to that, that this nomination is tainted, because if you know anything about this, it doesn’t look very good.
 
“Blagojevich, who was arrested at his home, going to work one morning, for trying to sell the office. We’ve seen, time and time again, in print and before the electronic media, the crude language of Blagojevich, saying this is an ‘effin gold mine, I’ve got to get anything I can out of it.’
 
“How are we supposed to react? We reacted in a very reasonable way.”
 
But cracks in Reid’s seemingly entrenched stance began to appear just days after the first statement.
 
In a

Chu said all the world's coal burned up is ""worst nightmare""
","
Steven Chu, Barack Obama's nominee for energy secretary, is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and a director of one of the prestigious national laboratories in the Energy Department.
 
His biography on the Web site of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory describes him as ""one of the nation’s foremost and outspoken advocates for scientific solutions to the twin problems of global warming and the need for carbon-neutral renewable sources of energy.""
 
But the Senate's foremost skeptic on global warming expressed concern.
 
""Steven Chu has made troubling comments,"" said Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla. ""Chu has unabashedly called coal — which generates over 50 percent of our nation’s electricity — his 'worst nightmare.'""
 
We've never had nightmares about coal or any other fossil fuel, so we wondered whether Chu made the comment and what he meant by it.
 
It is indisputable that Chu called coal his worst nightmare. In fact, you can

watch him make the comment

during a videotaped talk on YouTube. (He says ""Coal is my worst nightmare"" at the 28-minute, 16-second mark.) It was part of a long speech he gave on renewable energy, and the video makes it clear he was talking about worldwide coal use.
 
The context was a discussion of global warming, and he was talking about global coal supplies and what it meant for global warming. He was not talking about domestic utilities or energy prices for consumers.
 
 At his confirmation hearing, Chu was asked about the ""nightmare"" comment, and he explained it this way:
 
""I said that in the following context. If the world continues to use coal the way we are using it today, and the world — I mean in particular not only the United States but China, India and Russia — then it is a pretty bad dream. That is to say in China, for example, they have not yet begun to even trap the sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides. There's mercury. There's particulate matter, as well as carbon dioxide.
 
""But I also say many times in my talks that coal is an abundant resource in the world. Two-thirds of the known coal reserves in the world lie in only four countries: the United States, first and foremost, followed by India, China and Russia. India, China, Russia and the United States, I believe, will not turn their back on coal.
 
""So it is imperative that we figure out a way to use coal as cleanly as possible. And so for that reason — and I think — again, my optimism as scientist — we will develop those technologies to capture a large fraction of the carbon dioxide that's emitted in coal plants and to safely sequester them. So if confirmed as secretary of energy, I will work very hard to extensively develop these technologies, so that the United States and the rest of the world can use it.""
 
We watched the video, and this seems like an accurate description of the context of his remarks. So Inhofe's ""nightmare"" comment is literally accurate, but it divorces Chu's words of important context. Still, there are aspects of coal that genuinely disturb Chu.
 
We deduct points for that lack of context and find Inhofe's charge Mostly True.

Scott Walker says state board failed for 16 elections to audit voter list to remove felons
","To rally support for a GOP bill to break apart Wisconsin’s agency that oversees elections and ethics matters, Gov. Scott Walker is casting the Government Accountability Board as incompetent. At one point, he stormed Twitter using the #ReformGAB hashtag. In one Oct. 13, 2015 tweet, he claimed the agency wanted to consider Mickey Mouse and Adolf Hitler as valid signatures on recall petitions -- a claim we rated False. In another tweet from the series that day, Walker wrote: ""GAB ignored their duties & did not regularly audit the voter rolls to remove all felons - for a span of 16 elections. #ReformGAB"" With the issue still awaiting final action in the Republican-controlled Legislature, we decided to check it out. GAB history

In 2007, the Legislature combined two agencies -- one overseeing ethics, the other overseeing elections -- to create the Government Accountability Board. The board was created in the wake of the 2002 caucus scandal, which involved politicians from both sides of the aisle misusing taxpayer-paid staffers to conduct campaign work, and amid other questions about how well elections were being overseen. Then-Senate Majority Leader Mike Ellis (R-Neenah) led the charge. The bill was approved unanimously in the Senate and only had two dissenting votes in the Assembly. Since 2008, the board -- made up of retired judges appointed by the governor and approved by the state Senate -- has overseen Wisconsin elections, campaign finance, lobbying and ethics laws. One of the board’s responsibilities is to conduct post-election reviews to determine if any felons voted in that election. That’s where Walker’s claim comes in. The audit Walker’s team pointed to a December 2014 report from the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau as support for his claim that the board ""ignored their duties and did not regularly audit"" voters to remove felons ""for a span of 16 elections."" So what does the report say? According to the audit, GAB officials told auditors in May 2014 that post-election felon audits from 16 elections between February 2010 through April 2014 had not been completed. Under state law, the board is required to conduct post-election audits of voters who registered on Election Day, or within 20 days before an election, to determine if any ineligible felons voted. The GAB staff told auditors they did not perform these reviews, in part, because of concerns that the system to identify felons who remained on probation or parole wasn’t reliable. Individuals who are not felons were being flagged as having voting illegally. One person was even charged with illegally voting as a felon based on a false positive match.

Agency officials said they put post-election audits on hold until the system for checks was more accurate. The agency added additional steps to the final audit to catch false positives before referral to the district attorney. The audit notes the review was completed by July 2014. So this duty was postponed for 16 elections, but not ignored entirely. What’s more, Walker’s claim is a bit jumbled. He said the ignored duty was meant to remove felons. But the post-election felon audit is a final check to see if any felons voted, not primarily to remove them from voter rolls. That effort comes earlier in the process, and is done mainly by local clerks. Each month, GAB receives a list of felons from the Department of Corrections, which is then compared against the voter list. Matches are referred to the voter’s municipal clerk’s office, which decides if there is a true match and inactivates the voter. The Legislative Audit Bureau did not find GAB to have neglected this duty. GAB also provides clerks with the list of felons before the election to ensure none of them received an absentee ballot, registered later or on Election Day. Our rating Walker said the state Government Accountability Board ""ignored their duties and did not regularly audit"" voters to remove felons ""for a span of 16 elections."" The GAB postponed the completion of post-election audits, due to concerns about inaccurate identification of felons, according to a Legislative Audit Bureau report. But the audit in question was not primarily designed to remove voters from the rolls as Walker claims. That work, which involves local clerks, comes before the election. For a statement that is partially accurate, but misleading, we rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2015/nov/06/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-state-board-failed-16-elections-/
"['Campaign Finance', 'Elections', 'Virginia', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Sanders says Koch brothers are outspending either political party in 2016 elections
","U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., recently urged students at George Mason University and across the nation to stand against the Koch brothers. Multibillionaires Charles and David Koch run Koch Industries, headquartered in Wichita, Kan. They’ve generated headlines in recent years for their roles in creating conservative fundraising groups - including Americans for Prosperity - that are not required to disclose their donors or the amounts each gave. Sanders lit into the Koch brothers at an Oct. 28 rally for his Democratic presidential campaign that was held at GMU and live-streamed across the nation. ""You all have one vote, and I hope you’ll exercise that vote,"" he said. ""The Koch brothers - second-wealthiest family and extreme right wing family - they also have one vote, but they are going to spend some $900 million in this campaign to try to elect candidates who will cut Social Security, Medicare, federal aid to education and environmental programs. ""When you have one family - this is America, this it not some small Third World country - when in the United States of America you have one family spending more money than either the Democratic or Republican parties, that is not democracy. That is oligarchy, and we have got to change that."" The GMU rally hardly was the first time Sanders has claimed the Koch brothers personally will outspend either party this election cycle. It’s a standard line in his stump speech, and we wondered whether it’s true. We asked Warren Gunnels, Sanders’ policy director, for evidence. He sent us a link to the two political parties’ spending during the most recent presidential campaign and reports about projected spending for the Koch brothers’ political network leading up to the 2016 election. Political party spending In 2012, the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee collectively spent $647 million, according to tallies from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics that Gunnels cited. The center’s figures show that the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Republican Senatorial Committee together spent $674.5 million. The figures Gunnels cited were for each national party’s major fundraising organization for presidential and congressional races. But the total amount raised by the parties went higher, because both Democrats and Republicans have additional committees - such as state and local party organizations - that also spend money on campaigns. All told, the Democratic Party spent nearly $1.1 billion and the Republican Party spent slightly more than $1 billion in 2012, according to the center’s figures. Viveca Novak, a spokeswoman for the center, said her group doesn’t have an estimate for how much the parties will spend for the 2016 elections, although she expects total overall spending will increase from the 2012 cycle. Richard Skinner, a policy analyst at the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit that tracks campaign spending, told us he expects each party’s spending this cycle would be either the same or greater than it was in 2012. Koch network projected spending Gunnels referred us to a January 2015 story in The New York Times that said the Koch brothers told a gathering of mega-donors that their political network set a goal of spending $889 million in the next two years. The article said that type of goal would require a significant commitment from the roughly 300 donors the Kochs had recruited in recent years. Because the Kochs’ political network consists of nonprofit groups that don’t have to identify their donors, The Times said it would be impossible to determine how much of the money ultimately is contributed by the brothers and how much comes from other donors. As The Washington Post noted in an October fact check about a similar Sanders claim, the brothers released further details in Koch Industries’ June newsletter, saying that only one-third of their fundraising goal would be spent on presidential, congressional, state and local races. The remaining two-thirds, the newsletter said, would help ""support research and educational programs, scholarships and other efforts designed to change policies and promote a culture of freedom in the United States,"" including donations to the United Negro College Fund and criminal justice reform. In an October radio interview with American Public Media’s ""Marketplace,"" Charles Koch dialed back the spending projection, saying he expected his political network to spend $750 million, with about $250 million of it dedicated to campaigns. ""And as I said, a very small portion of that 250 (million) comes from the so-called Koch brothers, and even less from me than from my brother, because everybody can choose what they want to give to,"" Koch said in the radio interview. ""So it isn't the Koch brothers doing it. It's other people doing it."" ""Marketplace"" host Kai Ryssdal said that sounded disingenuous. ""You have money in politics throughout the system, and for you to sit there and say, ‘I'm sorry, this isn't really us,’ doesn't ring true and will not ring true when people hear this interview,"" Ryssdal said. Our ruling Sanders said ""one family"" - the Koch brothers - will spend more than either major political party in the 2016 campaign. Since it’s too early to know what each party will spend on the next year’s elections, Sanders bases his claim on what each party’s congressional and presidential campaign committees spent in the 2012 cycle. That came to $647 million by Democrats and $675 million by Republicans. These, however, are low-ball figures. When spending by the parties’ state and local committees are considered, the total rises to about $1.1 billion for Democrats and $1 billion for Republicans. On the other hand, Sanders high-balls the Kochs’ plans, pointing their announced goal in January to raise $900 million and not their updated estimate last month of raising $750 million. In either case, the Kochs made it clear that most of the money would not come from their own pockets but from a political network of anonymous contributors. Sanders also overlooks the Kochs’ assurances that only one-third of the money will go to political campaigns, with the remainder dedicated to research and educational programs that ""promote a culture of freedom."" So anyway you dice it, it does not appear that the Koch brothers will outspend either one of the major political parties in next year’s elections. The burden is on Sanders to prove otherwise, and he falls short. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2015/nov/06/bernie-sanders/sanders-says-koch-brothers-are-outspending-either-/

Rep. Glenn Grothman hears from employers, changes stance on Ex-Im Bank
","As a state senator running for Congress in 2014, Glenn Grothman of Campbellsport had some strong opinions about the Export-Import Bank. Like the other conservative Republicans contending for the open seat, Grothman was against the obscure federal agency. ""We do not need corporate welfare, which I guess I would say the Import-Export Bank is,"" Grothman said at a July 29, 2014 candidate forum.   Grothman ultimately won the seat, but now sees things another way. Time to break out the Flip-O-Meter, which examines whether a politician has changed position on an issue. Remember: It does not measure whether any change is good or bad policy or politics, only whether the candidate has been consistent. The Export-Import Bank helps U.S. companies sell their goods and services in foreign countries by providing financing for export deals. Opponents echo Grothman’s ""corporate welfare"" line, while supporters say the bank helps level the playing field for U.S. companies competing in the global marketplace. Things looked bad for the bank’s future during the summer of 2015 after conservatives in the House of Representatives refused to reauthorize funding. The House let the charter of the bank lapse at the end of June. The Senate voted to reauthorize the bank on July 26, 2015 and in the fall efforts to revive the measure in the House gained steam as prominent business groups pressed for reauthorization. In Wisconsin, that came as General Electric Co. announced Sept. 28, 2015 it would cut hundreds of jobs in Waukesha and move the work to Canada. The company said the move was being made because of the demise of the bank. In an interview, Grothman said that as a reauthorization vote drew closer, he heard from 42 businesses in his district with officials urging him to vote to continue the bank, which he did when the matter came before the House on Oct. 27, 2015. ""You add that up and you add up the fact that such a high number of manufacturing jobs are tied to suppliers,"" Grothman said of the calls he received. ""Per capita, Wisconsin is one of the largest users of the Export-Import Bank."" Grothman cited The Manitowoc Co., Caterpillar Corp. and Oshkosh Corp.’s Pierce fire engine division as among the heavy users of the bank. The congressman also said he learned more about the economy of Wisconsin’s 6th congressional district, which he represents. ""This district has more manufacturing jobs than almost any other one,"" he said, adding: ""It’s not something I dealt with in the state Legislature."" As for the position he took at the debate, Grothman said he was ""called upon to give an answer about the bank. Obviously, I got one side of the issue when I said I was opposed to it. You talk to the big manufacturers and you get the other side of it."" Grothman is not the first state politician to switch positions on funding the bank. U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) voted against the bank shortly after he took office in 2012. He joined the majority in supporting the agency in July 2015. In an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Johnson said he changed his mind after hearing from state employers. We rated his switch a Full Flop. Our rating As a candidate in 2014, Grothman said he was opposed to the Export-Import Bank, calling it a form of corporate welfare.

Donald Trump's false claim that his tax plan wouldn't increase the deficit

In asking the question, Harwood brought up the billionaire’s proposal to cut taxes without adding to the deficit — a goal, Harwood said, that’s nigh impossible.

Trump: ""Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who is a great guy, who came out the other day and said, ‘I love Trump's tax plan.’ "" For the record, Larry Kudlow, a conservative economist and former CNBC anchor, said in September that he ""really likes Trump’s plan."" During the debate, Kudlow told Breitbart that he specifically loves Trump’s proposal for a 15 percent corporate tax rate but ""can’t speak for the whole plan."" But what about the whole plan? Will it be, as Trump wrote in a Wall Street Journal column, ""revenue neutral""? We didn’t hear back from the Trump campaign. But based on analyses conducted by two tax groups, Trump’s plan would lead to a revenue loss of $10 trillion to 12 trillion over 10 years. The plan Released on Sept. 28, Trump’s tax plan aims to, you guessed it, ""make America great again"" by providing tax breaks for middle-class Americans, simplifying the tax code, growing the American economy and not adding to our debt and deficit. It includes: • Four income tax brackets with rates of 0, 10, 20 and 25 percent, with no deductions except for the charitable and mortgage interest deductions; • A corporate tax rate of 15 percent, an end to the deferment of overseas corporate income, and repatriating of foreign income at a 10 percent rate; • A pass-through business income tax rate of 15 percent; • A capital gains tax at 0, 15 and 20 percent; and a tax on carried interest as ordinary income; • Eliminating the alternative minimum tax, the net investment income surtax, the estate tax and the Affordable Care Act taxes. The impact Both right- and left-leaning groups found that Trump’s plan could lead to at least a $10 trillion revenue loss in a decade, without factoring in interest. The liberal Citizens for Tax Justice pegged the cost of Trump’s plan at $12 trillion over 10 years and pointed out that 37 percent of the tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent. Trump’s plan, according to the free market-oriented Tax Foundation, would cut taxes by almost $12 trillion and also lead to an 11 percent higher GDP. With this projected growth, Trump’s plan would still reduce revenues by $10.14 trillion. To make the plan revenue neutral, Trump would have to make huge spending cuts. Experts said the scale of the cuts would not be realistic, given that Trump himself has said he intends to protect popular programs such as Medicare and Social Security. ""It’s hard to imagine any way that this could be revenue neutral … unless you’re going to go after entitlements in a big way,"" said Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which hasn’t released an analysis of Trump’s plan yet. ""Contrary to Trump’s assertion that his plan would not increase the deficit, it would,"" Scott Hodge of the Tax Foundation told us. He added that economic growth, investment, higher wages and jobs are far more important than adding or decreasing the deficit. Our ruling Trump said his tax plan would not increase the deficit. Free market-oriented and liberal groups alike say Trump’s tax plan would lead to a $10 trillion revenue loss, even if it did create economic growth. Since Trump has said he will not slash retirement programs like Social Security and Medicare, experts doubt that any spending cuts he made would result in a revenue-neutral tax plan.

"['Taxes', 'Florida', 'Jeb Bush']","
Jeb Bush says the middle class gets the biggest tax break under his plan
","Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said at a recent debate that his plan to streamline the tax system will benefit everyone, but it will benefit the middle class the most. ""Look, the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family,"" Bush said during the Oct. 28, 2015, CNBC debate. He added that simplifying the tax code will boost economic growth. We wondered, does the middle class really stand to benefit the most from Bush’s proposed tax cuts? That could be accurate if you examine the rates in a particular way, experts told us, but in practice it’s likely the highest earners would see the real windfall from Bush’s plan. The Reform and Growth Act of 2017 Bush released his tax plan in September 2015, with an emphasis on streamlining the code, lowering rates and easing up on corporate taxes. Some analyses point out the plan could add to the budget deficit. Bush’s plan: • Cuts the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three with rates of 10, 25 and 28 percent, down from a current top rate of 39.6 percent; • Lowers the top corporate tax rate and taxes on capital gains to 20 percent; • Eliminates the estate tax, gift tax, Alternative Minimum Tax and the Affordable Care Act (and its 3.8 percent surtax on investment income); • Limits itemized deductions to 2 percent of adjusted gross income, except for charitable contributions, and eliminates deductions for state and local taxes; • Increases standard deductions for single filers by $5,000 and for joint filers by $10,000 and doubles Earned Income Tax Credit for childless workers. It’s the last point that Bush’s campaign has claimed will be one of the biggest boosts to the middle class. There are myriad ways to define ""middle class,"" but several experts told us a good rule of thumb is a family of four making the median family income, which was $53,657 in 2014. When we asked the Bush campaign for specifics, they referred us to the plan online, which includes a table showing their calculations for how the changes would affect certain levels of income.  According to Bush, the savings after paying taxes are a higher percentage gain for middle incomes than for higher incomes. Some analysts and economists we contacted said that $2,000 figure could be about right, considering the difference in the 25- and 28-percent tax brackets Bush proposes. But one caveat is that his comparison is only counting people who take the standard deduction when filing their income tax returns. Because people with higher incomes tend to itemize, that means the sample of wealthy people to which Bush is comparing his middle class savings is much smaller than it could be. Vanessa Williamson, a governance studies fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank, said roughly 90 percent of people making more than $100,000 per year itemize, and higher for people who earn more than that. Only about 58 percent of people making between $50,000 and $75,000 itemize. ""Wealthier people are not, as a general rule, filling out the 1040EZ and calling it a day,"" said Williamson said. ""The vast majority of high-income people itemize their taxes ... and cut their taxes a great deal by doing so."" (Think Warren Buffet paying just 17 percent.) Now, Bush’s plan does limit the value of itemized deductions, and many middle-class families would benefit from a higher standard deduction. Some researchers think this plan will significantly decrease the number of people who itemize by simplifying their returns. Other analyses, however, show that the highest earners get a much bigger break than Bush has implied, because they would benefit disproportionately from changes like lowering corporate taxes and repealing the estate tax. One report by research group Citizens for Tax Justice, which advocates for tax fairness, said the middle fifth of earners would see a 3.2 percent change in their income, but the top 1 percent would realize a 10.2 percent benefit. They said middle income families would be getting $1,572 back, but the top 1 percent would average more than $177,000. The pro-business Tax Foundation examined the plan, too. A projection based on exceptionally robust growth showed middle earners saw their adjusted gross incomes go up as much as 12.9 percent over an unspecified length of time. The top 1 percent’s incomes would go up 16.4 percent. Our ruling Bush said, ""My plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family."" Middle-class families could potentially realize a higher percentage tax break, based on Bush’s plan. But that’s only counting those who would file their tax returns using the standard deduction, something the wealthy aren’t likely to do. Even with caps on itemized deductions, a range of experts said the wealthiest Americans stand to benefit more than the middle class, thanks to Bush’s proposed changes in corporate, estate and other taxes. Bush’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Ten times more 'dark money' has been spent for 2016 elections, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin says
","Soliciting contributions to her campaign fund, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin warned her supporters about the dangers of ""dark money"" -- cash spent on elections by groups that don’t have to disclose their donors. In an Oct. 30, 2015 email, the Wisconsin Democrat wrote that groups backed by conservatives such as Karl Rove and the Koch brothers ""have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to make sure they get right-wing extremists elected into office. And it’s only getting worse."" ""Today,"" Baldwin’s email continued, ""dark money spending is 10 times what it was at the same point in the 2012 election cycle. And in 2012, it ended up topping $308 million."" Then she asked for a contribution of $5 or more. A year away from the 2016 general election, is dark-money spending already 10 times higher than it was at this point four years ago? The answer, from the source widely acknowledged as the best in this area: Yes. What dark is We consulted the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan campaign finance research group that runs a website called OpenSecrets.org. (Two other groups involved in campaign finance -- the Sunlight Foundation and the Campaign Finance Institute -- also referred us to the center.) Using data from the Federal Election Commission, the Center for Responsive Politics tracks so-called dark-money spending -- that is, expenditures by nonprofit groups, whose primary function is not supposed to be political activity, that don’t have to disclose their donors. Those groups can receive unlimited corporate, individual, or union contributions. They can use the money for various election activities, including buying ads that advocate for or against a candidate, running phone banks and making contributions to super PACs. But they can’t coordinate with or donate money to candidates. Let’s start with 2011 and 2012 -- that is, the 2012 election  cycle. 2012 election cycle The center reports that, as Baldwin indicated, more than $308 million in dark money was spent during the entire 2012 election cycle. Some 86 percent was spent by conservative groups, 11 percent by liberal groups and 3 percent by other groups. The most -- $71 million -- was spent by American Crossroads/Crossroads GPS, which was co-founded by Rove. Americans for Prosperity, founded in part by the billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch, was second ($36 million) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was third ($35 million). The three leading liberal groups, as identified by the center, were the League of Conservation Voters ($11 million), Patriot Majority USA ($7 million), whose priorities include money for public schools and infrastructure, and Planned Parenthood (nearly $7 million). 2016 cycle As for the 2016 cycle, $4.88 million in dark money expenditures have already been made, according to the center. That’s more than 10 times the $440,000 that was spent at this point during the 2012 cycle. The $4.88 million has been spent by six groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ($3 million) and Americans for Prosperity ($1.5 million), The only liberal group was Planned Parenthood, which spent just under $75,000 Richard Skinner, policy analyst at the Sunlight Foundation, told us that the focus of early dark money being spent in the 2016 cycle is on U.S. Senate elections that are considered to be competitive, though some is also being spent on U.S. House races. (Baldwin isn’t up for election again until 2018. But Wisconsin’s other senator, Republican Ron Johnson, is rated as being in a ""pure toss-up"" race in 2016 from Democrat Russ Feingold, whom Johnson defeated in 2010. No dark money has been spent yet in that race, according to the Sunlight Foundation.) Skinner said he didn’t know whether dark money spending so far means that the total for the 2016 cycle will ultimately be 10 times higher than four years earlier. But he said he expects more dark money to spent in the 2016 cycle than ever before. Our rating Baldwin said ""dark money spending"" in the 2016 election cycle ""is 10 times what it was at the same point in the 2012 election cycle,"" when it topped $308 million. So-called dark money spending in election campaigns -- by groups that don’t have to disclose their donors -- exceeded $308 million in the 2012 election cycle. So far in the 2016 cycle, it has reached nearly $5 million, more than 10 times the $440,000 that had been spent at this point in the 2012 cycle. We rate Baldwin’s statement True.

Daily Show's Trevor Noah says Iowa GOP caucus 'stopped mattering years ago'
","Iowa Republicans might have had good reason to stiff The Daily Show, but the move drew a predictable reaction.  The party turned down the program’s request to cover a major gathering of the presidential contenders saying they thought the program would come only to make fun of their state. New host Trevor Noah was miffed. ""Our problem isn't with Iowa as a state, it's with its bloated role in the American elections,"" Noah said. ""I don't understand, especially because Iowa's Republican caucus stopped mattering years ago. It in no way determines the party nominee, let alone the general election winners. Ask Mike Huckabee and even less-President Rick Santorum."" We thought we’d look into Noah’s assertion that Iowa’s GOP caucus no longer matters and that it ""in no way determines the party nominee."" Strictly by the numbers, Iowa’s Republicans don’t have a great track record of picking the ultimate nominee. There have been seven contested caucuses since the party held its first one in 1976. Out of that, the party’s voters can boast three hits and four misses. In baseball, they’d be a valuable .400-plus hitter. But in politics, not so much. ""At best, Iowa Republicans have a mediocre record of picking the eventual nominee in the caucuses,"" said Peverill Squire, a political scientist at the University of Missouri. ""The Iowa caucuses, particularly on the GOP side, matter less in 2016 than they did a decade or two ago."" This table shows how both the Republican and Democratic caucuses have performed over the years. Green means success. 
 Democrats have a better batting average, but a few details for contests in both parties bear noting. In 1972, the Democrats held the first caucus and it barely registered on the political scene. South Dakota Sen. George McGovern, the eventual nominee, campaigned for all of about two days in the state. In 1976, the category of Uncommitted was allowed and while Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter came out on top with 28 percent, Uncommitted took 37 percent. In 2012, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum got the most votes, but out of nearly 60,000 votes cast between him and Mitt Romney, his margin of victory was a microscopic 34 votes. (The race was so close that the Iowa GOP initially called the caucuses for Romney.) Romney went on to take the nomination. So Iowa Republicans didn’t pick the ultimate winner, but they came incredibly close. Where does this leave us? If you measure the Republican Iowa caucus against who gets the nomination, it does poorly. But political scientist Dennis Goldford at Drake University in Iowa said that’s a false premise. Goldford said he doesn’t know any serious observer who expects that out of Iowa. ""It’s more likely to tell you who won’t be the president, or who won’t be the nominee,"" he said. Squire echoed that view. ""The traditional role of the caucuses in both parties has really been to winnow the field,"" he said. Goldford said the significance of the caucuses stems entirely from Iowa being the very first step in the nomination process. Under new rules, candidates will gain delegates to the nominating convention. But the impact goes beyond delegates at a convention. ""What they do is reveal unexpected strengths and weaknesses among the candidates,"" he said. A second-place finish for a candidate thought to be a dark horse can be seen as a win. The same result for a front runner is seen as a loss, with potential repercussions in the primaries that follow. Squire reminded us that Iowa is important in another way. With only one exception, one of the top three finishers in Iowa has gone on to become the Republican nominee. From this comes the old saw -- there are three tickets out of Iowa. In 1980, Ronald Reagan came in second. George Bush took third in 1988, and in 2012, Romney was second by a whisker. The outlier is John McCain in 2008. He came in fourth but in an historic recovery, became the Republican nominee. Squire argued that shaping the field, rather than being a King-maker, is healthier for the democratic process. Our ruling Noah said that the Republican Iowa caucuses ""stopped mattering years ago"" and ""in no way determines the party nominee."" Noah has a point about the track record of the GOP caucus picking the eventual nominee, but he pushes it too far when he says they have no impact on the nomination process. Generally, winning or doing reasonably well in Iowa puts a candidate on the path to the nomination. We rate this claim Half True.

Update: This post has been updated to note that the Iowa GOP initially called Romney the winner in 2012.",/factchecks/2015/nov/04/trevor-noah/daily-shows-trevor-noah-says-iowa-gop-caucuses-don/

Marco Rubio said there was never evidence that the attacks on Benghazi were spontaneous
","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio portrayed Hillary Clinton as lying about the circumstances of the Benghazi attack when she said the attacks were the result of an anti-Muslim video instead of al-Qaida-like terrorists. ""There was not a single person on the ground in Benghazi who believed that it was a spontaneous uprising,"" he said in an interview on CNN on Oct. 29, 2015. CNN’s Chris Cuomo asked Rubio how it could be a lie if the CIA told Clinton it was due to a demonstration. Rubio replied: ""She consistently, privately told people, over and over again, including in the early aftermath of it, that this was led by al-Qaida-like elements. There was never a single shred of evidence presented to anyone that this was spontaneous, and in fact, the CIA themselves understood that early on, irrespective of what the administration is telling you now."" We wanted to fact-check what Rubio said about what the CIA understood, drawing on the seven congressional investigations that followed, as well as news articles provided by Rubio and testimony by officials that the Clinton campaign sent us. What we found is a very murky situation. It seems like there were indications early on that the attacks were not the result of simple protests. But also early on, some in the government did seem to think that demonstrations over the video were a factor. That constitutes something of a ""shred,"" contrary to what Rubio said. Timeline of reports about what prompted the attacks To try to sort out the evidence, we created a timeline to show when information was shared about the reason for the attacks. (Other media have created their own timelines, including Factcheck.org and the Washington Post’s The Fact Checker.) Sept. 11, 2012: The attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound begins at 3:40 p.m. ET (9:40 p.m. in Benghazi); an attack on a CIA mission annex begins at 6 p.m. ET. Four Americans die in the attacks. Sept. 11, 2012: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta met with Defense Department officials a couple hours after the attack ""to discuss the Benghazi attack and other violence in the region in reaction to the anti-Muslim video,"" according to a report from the bipartisan Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Several officials later told this committee that they believed it was a terrorist attack immediately or almost immediately. Sept. 11, 2012: Clinton issued a statement that didn’t indicate a cause for the attack but said, ""Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet."" At 11:12 p.m. Clinton sent an email to her daughter Chelsea saying the attack was conducted by an al-Qaida like group. Another email revealed that Clinton, during a phone call with Libyan President Mohamed Magariaf around 8 p.m. ET, said she understood Ansar al-Sharia, an al-Qaida-affiliated group, claimed responsibility for the attacks. However, 24 hours after taking responsibility for the attacks, Ansar al-Sharia retracted the claim. Sept. 11, 2012: Two alerts were issued by the State Department Operations Center to administration officials, according to the House Republican Conference report. The first said the U.S. facilities were under attack, while the second linked the attacks to Ansar al-Sharia. Neither alert mentioned a protest related to the video. Sept. 12, 2012: In the first CIA assessment of the attacks, the CIA said ""the presence of armed assailants from the incident’s outset suggests this was an intentional assault and not the escalation of a peaceful protest."" According to the bipartisan House Intelligence Committee report, the CIA later said the initial assessment lacked supporting evidence and was subsequently left out of reports. Meanwhile, analysts ""received 21 reports that a protest occurred in Benghazi."" Fourteen of those reports were issued from the Open Source Center (a CIA intelligence center), while the rest came from the CIA, the Defense Department and the NSA. However, the bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found issues with the reports because they included information from early news reports, not just original intelligence. The reports were also based on intercepted communications and informants’ tips, according to the New York Times.   Sept, 12, 2012: President Barack Obama, speaking in the Rose Garden, said, ""No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation."" While he didn’t refer to the video directly, Obama did say, ""We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others."" Sept. 15, 2012: The CIA’s chief of station in Tripoli wrote an email to the then-deputy director of the CIA saying that the attacks were ""not an escalation of protests."" The intelligence community ""also had information that there were no protests outside the Temporary Mission Facility prior to the attacks, but did not incorporate that information into its widely circulated assessments in a timely manner,"" according to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report. Sept. 16, 2012: United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice appeared on five Sunday talk shows. She talked about the video several times and said, ""We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned."" She said on NBC’s Meet the Press that the current assessment was the attack was ""a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo -- almost a copycat of the demonstrations against our facility in Cairo, which were prompted, of course, by the video."" The administration was later criticized for the talking points fed to Rice in advance of her interviews. In an email from Ben Rhodes, the then-deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, one of those talking points stated: ""Since we began to see protests in response to this Internet video, the president has directed the administration to take a number of steps."" Sept. 18, 2012: The CIA and FBI reviewed video footage from the Benghazi compound that showed no protests preceding the attack. Sept. 19, 2012: Director of National Intelligence Matt Olsen said during a congressional hearing that the State Department officials in Benghazi died ""in the course of a terrorist attack on our embassy."" Sept. 20, 2012: Clinton said during a press conference that ""the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and reprehensible, and the United States government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it."" Sept. 21, 2012: Clinton attributed the attack to terrorism during a press conference: ""What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four Americans."" Sept. 24, 2012: The CIA changed its assessment of the attacks after determining that no protests occurred outside the Benghazi facility before the attacks. Sept. 28, 2012: Shawn Turner, a spokesperson for the Director of National Intelligence, issued a statement that officials initially thought that the attack was spontaneous but soon concluded that terrorists were involved: ""In the immediate aftermath, there was information that led us to assess that the attack began spontaneously following protests earlier that day at our embassy in Cairo. We provided that initial assessment to Executive Branch officials and members of Congress, who used that information to discuss the attack publicly and provide updates as they became available. ... As we learned more about the attack, we revised our initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that it was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists."" Rubio campaign evidence As for whether there was never ""a single shred of evidence"" presented that the attack was spontaneous despite what Clinton said, a spokeswoman for Rubio pointed to news articles in conservative media about what Clinton and the former acting CIA director Michael Morell said about the attacks. For example, in an Oct. 23, 2015, Fox News report, Charles Woods, father of Ty Woods, who died in the Benghazi attack, shared diary notes he took after meeting Clinton on Sept. 14, 2012. The two spoke at a ceremony when the victims’ bodies were flown back to the United States. ""I gave Hillary a hug and shook her hand. And she said we are going to have the filmmaker arrested who was responsible for the death of my son,"" the entry said. In Morell’s 2015 book The Great War of Our Time, Morell wrote, ""Still others might have been motivated by the video -- although I should note our analysts never said the video was a factor in the Benghazi attacks."" Clinton campaign evidence Clinton’s campaign also pointed to statements made by government officials who described initial confusion. ""I think that the first week after 9/11, there was significant uncertainty about what had happened and disagreement among key people who shaped opinion,"" State Department Office Director for Maghreb Affairs William Roebuck told the Democratic Staff Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in August 2013. Adding to the confusion was that the Benghazi attack occurred around the same time as protests over the anti-Muslim video in Cairo. ""There was some confusion about have you had -- was this the same thing, were these two incidents the same, were they different?"" Roebuck said. ""The interagency was trying to sort that out. They were also trying to sort out the conflicting information from Benghazi itself. ... Like I said, there was a dispute among people who were looking very carefully at all of the evidence on the ground, and there was a legitimate disagreement about what had sort of been the precursor to the attack."" Our ruling Rubio said on CNN, ""There was never a single shred of evidence presented to anyone that this was spontaneous, and in fact, the CIA themselves understood that early on."" There was some initial confusion about what sparked the Sept. 11, 2012, attack. Although investigations showed that some officials thought it was a terrorist attack immediately, there at least appeared to be some question about whether the video could have played a role. Rubio exaggerates when he said there wasn’t a ""single shred of evidence."" There were several suggestions that it was because of a protest. However, he has a point that much of the early evidence pointed strongly to terrorism.

Does Ben Carson's tithe-based tax plan lead to a $1 trillion hole?
","Ben Carson’s tithe-based tax plan became the subject of a computational tussle between him and a CNBC moderator during the third GOP debate. Carson, a Seventh-day Adventist, has advocated for the federal government to adopt a tithing system across the board, referring to the Judeo-Christian practice of giving one-tenth of one’s income to the Church. ""I think God is a pretty fair guy,"" he reasoned in the first Republican debate. Moderator Becky Quick pointed out that a 10 percent flat tax would bring in a lot less revenue and asked how would that work. Tithing was just an analogy and the rate would actually be closer to 15 percent, Carson responded, adding that he’d fill the gap through ""strategic cutting."" But Quick continued to press him on the numbers. Here’s a snippet of their exchange on Oct. 28: Quick: ""You would have to cut government by about 40 percent to make it work with a $1.1 trillion hole."" Carson: ""It's not true."" Quick: ""It is true. I looked at the numbers."" Carson: ""When we put all the facts down, you will be able to see that it's not true. It works out very well."" So true or not true? Carson has yet to release a tax plan, and his spokesman Doug Watts said that Quick ""got several assumptions wrong"" though he didn’t respond when we asked him which ones. But based on what Carson has said so far, Quick’s math is sound. The plan Carson’s campaign website calls for wholesale tax reform and ""to end the IRS as we know it,"" but includes almost no specifics. That makes the Quick and Carson argument ""really quite pointless"" since there aren’t enough details to properly model, said Scott Hodge of the Tax Foundation, an organization that analyzes tax plans and tends to take a free-market, low-tax approach. ""When Dr. Carson releases enough detail of his plan we will model it as well on an apples-to-apples basis as the other plans,"" Hodge said. Carson’s formal tax plan will be released sometime within the next 30 days, Watts told us. Until then, we’ll assess what he has proposed so far, according to analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation, as well as our own research. It includes: • A flat income tax rate of 10 to 15 percent, phased in over time, with no deductions or loopholes; • A six-month tax hiatus for corporate profits overseas, but 10 percent has to be used in enterprise zones; • A corporate tax rate of 15 to 20 percent; • Eliminate the payroll tax, estate tax and the Affordable Care Act. Quick’s math Under the current tax system, the United States is expected to collect $3.2 trillion in revenue in 2015, while government spending will reach $3.7 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Quick likely got her numbers by applying Carson’s 15 percent tax rate to the total personal income and the total corporate income ($15.4 trillion and $2.1 trillion respectively, by the latest Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates for 2015). That would generate about $2.6 trillion in revenue. So Carson’s plan falls $0.6 trillion short of anticipated revenue, and $1.1 trillion short of spending. To break even, you’d have to reduce spending by about 30 percent annually, not as Quick said, 40 percent. We should note that this line of computation assumes that Carson would get rid of all other sources of revenue. Though he hasn’t offered specifics on excise taxes, customs duties, etc., he has proposed to eliminate both the payroll tax (projected to generate $1.1 trillion in 2015) and the estate tax ($20 billion), which alone put him in the hole. Carson’s math After objecting to Quick’s calculations, Carson himself crunched the numbers a different way during the CNBC debate:   ""If you talk about an $18 trillion economy, you are talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product, you are talking about $2.7 trillion. We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion. But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly. So that's not, by any stretch, pie in the sky."" Experts, however, had a few bones to pick with Carson’s math, starting with its premise. First, not all of GDP is taxable, pointed out Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center. To apply his rate to all $18 trillion, Carson would have to tax health insurance premiums, pensions and government spending (the $3.7 trillion that Carson wants to cut) to name a few. Second, even if we assume that you can tax all of GDP, the 15 percent tax rate still falls short of anticipated revenue and spending, as Carson acknowledges himself. Contrary to what he said, however, you can’t ""make that amount up"" by applying the rate to corporate taxes and capital gains. That would be double-counting, since those are already a part of the total GDP figure, a post-debate CNBC article pointed out. In short, taxing all of GDP by 15 percent would still create a $1 trillion hole this year. ""(That’s) the biggest piece of the biggest pie that we can come up with, and you’d still be short 20 percent of revenue. Good luck with that,"" Williams said. Our ruling Carson said ""it’s not true"" that his plan would leave us with a $1.1 trillion hole, as moderator Becky Quick said. But Quick’s math is sound, based on what's publicly known about Carson's plan. Carson’s 15 percent flat tax would generate a $1.1 trillion hole. By his own math, his plan would create a $1 trillion hole.  We rate Carson’s claim False.",/factchecks/2015/nov/04/ben-carson/does-ben-carsons-tithe-based-tax-plan-lead-1-trill/

Marco Rubio says biggest percentage gains from his tax plan will accrue to lowest-income groups
","During the CNBC Republican presidential debate, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., sparred with one of the moderators, John Harwood, over the impact of his tax proposal. Harwood asked Rubio, ""The Tax Foundation, which was alluded to earlier, scored your tax plan and concluded that you give nearly twice as much of a gain in after-tax income to the top 1 percent as to people in the middle of the income scale. Since you're the champion of Americans living paycheck-to-paycheck, don't you have that backward?"" Rubio responded, ""No, that's -- you're wrong. In fact, the largest after-tax gains (are) for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan. And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them."" As it turns out, they both have a point -- and later in the exchange, Rubio acknowledged that’s the case. Let’s take a closer look. Rubio’s plan First, let’s review what Rubio is proposing. He would: • Collapse the current seven brackets to just three -- 15 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent -- and set the top bracket’s rate lower than the current 39.6 percent top rate; • Exempt interest, dividends, and capital gains from income taxes; • Repeal the alternative minimum tax, the estate tax, and all taxes levied under the Affordable Care Act; • Reduce the corporate tax rate to 25 percent, down from 35 percent; • Create a new, partially refundable child tax credit of up to $2,500 per child; • Replace the standard deduction with a new refundable personal tax credit of $2,000 for individuals or $4,000 for married couples filing jointly. This credit would phase out at $150,000 for individuals and at $300,000 for married couples filing jointly and would disappear entirely at $200,000 for individuals and $400,000 for married couples filing jointly. In theory, these tax credits could be helpful to those at the lower end of the income scale as long as they are refundable -- that is, as long as people too poor to pay any income tax can get money back from the government. There has been a dispute over exactly how the refundability would work, and how different types of taxpayers could come out ahead under Rubio’s proposal. How this shakes out will have a potentially large impact on how favorable the Rubio plan would be for low-income Americans. But since the details aren’t settled, we will set that aside and focus instead on the Tax Foundation analysis, which was the one specifically referenced in the debate. We should note that the Tax Foundation is not the only organization that analyzes tax plans, and it tends to have a more free-market, low-tax approach than other groups that do similar work, notably the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.  The Tax Foundation assessment The part of the Tax Foundation analysis at issue is where they put the Rubio plan through an in-house mathematical model to determine how much incomes for different groups would change under the plan’s provisions. The foundation looked at two models. One, known as the ""static"" model, gauges the direct changes of the Rubio tax plan. The other, known as the ""dynamic"" model, factors in assumptions about how the tax changes would reverberate through the economy to create higher growth. For brevity, we’ll look at just the static results, which are actually more favorable toward Rubio’s claim, since they show stronger results for low-income taxpayers compared to higher-income taxpayers. Here’s what the foundation concluded, grouping people by 10 percent increments from lowest earning to highest earning:  So, taxpayers with adjusted gross income in the bottom 10 percent will, according to the foundation, see a 44.2 percent increase in their income, while those in the 10 percent to 20 percent category will see an increase of 11.4 percent. Those are the only two categories with increases higher than 5.5 percent. According to this chart, then, Rubio has a point -- at least when you define ""the greatest gains, percentage-wise"" as the increase in adjusted gross income by members of the lowest two deciles. Another way to look at it However, there’s another way to look at Rubio’s plan, and it doesn’t shine as favorable a light on how lower-income Americans would fare. Part of the reason why the gains by lower-income Americans stand out in this calculation is that their gains are high compared to a very small income base. Measured by raw dollars, people at the top of the income spectrum would receive the majority of the benefits. Because we had to cobble together the data from two sources that aren’t exactly the same -- the Tax Foundation and the Tax Policy Center -- it doesn’t produce a perfect calculation. But the results are wide enough to conclude that richest one-fifth benefits disproportionately from Rubio’s plan. Here’s the summary: Quintile Average after-tax income level for that quintile Average percentage gain in after-tax income under Rubio’s plan Average dollar gain in after-tax income under Rubio’s plan Each quintile’s percentage share of total income gains under Rubio’s plan Bottom 20% $12,478 27.8 percent $3,469 22 percent 2nd lowest 20% $30,191 5.4 percent $1,630 10 percent Middle 20% $51,687 2.1 percent $1,085 7 percent 2nd highest 20% $85,961 1.2 percent $1,031 6 percent Top 20% $238,685 3.7 percent $8,831 55 percent Total $16,046 100 percent The last column shows that a majority -- 55 percent -- of all new income gains under Rubio’s plan would flow to the top 20 percent of Americans. That’s more than twice as much as would flow to the bottom 20 percent of Americans -- the group Rubio said would benefit most. Middle-income taxpayers would actually fare the worst of all -- the middle 60 percent would get less than quarter of all new gains. Again, these are rough estimates. But the contrast is wide. Looking at it this way, ""the greatest gains, percentage-wise,"" would not be ""at the lower end of our plan,"" as Rubio put it. They would be at the top. And the wealthiest quintile’s benefits from the Rubio plan even outstrip the amount they pay into the tax system. Tax Policy Center data for 2013 shows that the top quintile paid 27.5 percent of all federal taxes. But they get back nearly twice that share of the benefits from Rubio’s plan. As it happens, Rubio seemed to acknowledge as much during the debate. When pressed by Harwood later in the exchange, Rubio said, ""Five percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand. So yeah, someone who makes more money, numerically, it's gonna be higher."" Still, Rubio stuck by his earlier claim. ""The greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are going to be be at the lower end of our plan,"" he said. Our ruling Rubio said that, according to the Tax Foundation, ""the greatest gains, percentage-wise,"" will be ""at the lower end of our plan."" Rubio has a point that, at least according to the foundation’s projections, the largest percentage income gains would show up in the bottom two deciles. However, it’s important to remember that in raw dollars, these gains are relatively modest compared with the total benefits that would accrue under the tax plan at the upper end of the income spectrum. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/nov/04/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-biggest-percentage-gains-his-tax-/

Does California have the most ambitious clean energy goals on the planet?
","LISTEN TO THIS STORY:  California is known for setting lofty clean energy goals. But are its targets the most ambitious on the planet? That’s what state Senate leader Kevin de León claimed in a speech in October after Gov. Jerry Brown signed SB 350, a landmark climate change package authored by the senator. The current legislation requires 50 percent of California’s electricity come from renewable energy sources by 2030. That’s up from an earlier mandate calling for 33 percent of the state’s energy to come from renewable sources by 2020. Currently, California gets about a quarter of its energy from renewables, thanks to the huge solar and wind farms that have popped up in places like the Mojave Desert in recent years. The bill by the Los Angeles Democrat also calls on the state to double the energy efficiency of its buildings by 2030. ""Senate Bill 350 puts us on track to generate half, half of our electricity from renewable sources. And double the energy efficiency of all of our buildings by 2030. No city in the state, no state in this nation, for that matter the entire world, has adopted targets more ambitious in scale,"" De León said in a speech at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. We decided to fact-check De León’s claim that no one else has more ambitious clean energy targets than California, with a focus on renewable energy.  Our research At first glance, the senator’s statement seemed headed for a ""False"" rating or even ""Pants on Fire!"" That’s because some countries, as well as other U.S. states, and even some cities in California have more aggressive renewable energy goals, at least on a percentage basis. San Francisco’s goal, for example, is to meet 100 percent of its electricity demand with renewable power by 2020 — a decade before California wants to get half of its electricity from renewables. Hawaii’s target is 100 percent renewable energy use by 2045. Vermont’s is 75 percent renewable use by 2032. The percentage threshold is higher for both states but further out than California’s. Internationally, Norway has a goal to produce 67.5 percent of its energy from renewables by 2020, which would be a higher rate and earlier timeframe than California’s goal. But looking at De León’s statement closely, he qualifies it by saying California’s clean energy goals are the most ambitious ""in scale."" His office clarified that the senator was referencing California’s large population size, and its potential to consume and produce more clean energy compared with other states and even some countries. California used 261.5 million megawatt hours of electricity two years ago. That was 27 times the amount used in Hawaii that year, and also far more than Vermont or even Norway. Considering that disparity, some clean energy experts said California does have the most ambitious goals, at least nationally. ""There are many different ways you can try to quantify this, and ways that you can judge how ambitious something is,"" said Brian Lips, who manages a national database on renewable energy for the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center. ""But, I think, in general, this claim was mostly true."" More difficult to answer is the question about whether California’s clean energy goals are the most ambitious globally. Various rankings place China at or near the top for global production of renewable energy, far beyond what California can produce. But that country’s goal of deriving 15 percent of its energy from renewables by 2020 lags behind the Golden State’s target of 33 percent by that year. Comparing California’s clean energy targets and with those of countries is difficult because not all goals are measured the same way, said Laura Wisland, a senior energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists and an expert on California renewable energy. Some countries list goals for future clean energy capacity, or the amount of energy they hope to generate after building wind, solar or other renewable energy projects, Wisland said. California’s goal, on the other hand, is tied to the amount of energy it actually uses each year. The enforcement of clean energy standards is a key factor in judging how aggressive they are. Goals set by about a quarter of the states in the U.S. that have renewable energy goals are non-binding recommendations, Wisland added. That’s not the case in California, said Alex Jackson, legal director for the Natural Resources Defense Council’s California Climate Project. NRDC is an environmental advocacy group. ""I think what differentiates California is the degree of specificity and accountability on the main strategies that we are going to be deploying to achieve that target,"" said Jackson, referring to the goals in SB 350. ""We have the goals in place. We also have the roadmap to get there, with the appropriate oversight and enforcement to hold emitters accountable."" In 2012, California became the first state to create a comprehensive cap-and-trade program. It effectively puts a price on carbon emissions by imposing a limit on the amount of carbon dioxide industry can release. The state raises money for clean energy projects each year by auctioning emissions permits. Jackson said that model plus the new goals in SB 350 set California apart. ""If you add up the combined effect of the targets that are in the bill, they easily represent the most ambitious clean energy roadmap anywhere in the world,"" he said. Our ruling Senate leader Kevin de León says ""no city in the state, no state in this nation, for that matter the entire world, has adopted (clean energy) targets more ambitious in scale."" If we define ""ambitious"" as setting high goals and being able to follow through on them, then California clearly has some of the strongest clean energy initiatives in the country and on the planet. That doesn’t mean, however, that it has established the only aggressive targets. Prominent examples include Norway, Hawaii and even San Francisco. In terms of producing clean energy, California won’t be able to compete with global leaders such as China or the United States even if those countries have less aggressive renewable energy targets. Their size makes that impossible. But working in California’s favor, it has an enforcement framework in place. Notably, its cap-and-trade system provides an incentive for industry to invest in renewable energy. We rate the claim Mostly True, which we define as ""accurate but needs clarification or additional information.""",/factchecks/2015/nov/03/kevin-de-leon/does-california-have-most-ambitious-clean-energy-g/

Jerry Brown’s hazy claim: L.A. ‘invents’ smog
","LISTEN TO THIS STORY:  Sunshine, Hollywood and freeway gridlock are all inextricably linked to Los Angeles, and so is smog. But was the City of Angels the first to create the noxious, eye-stinging, smudgy haze? Weren’t other industrial cities spewing thick black smoke and creating smog centuries ago? As it turns out, it depends on what you consider ‘smog.’ Gov. Jerry Brown, a warrior in the state’s air pollution battles, offered his California-centric version of smog’s history during a speech in Los Angeles in October. ""Smog was invented in Los Angeles. It was,"" the governor told an audience at Griffith Observatory, with downtown Los Angeles cloaked in a brown haze several miles away, as shown in photos of the event. ""The name was invented. There was a fellow at Caltech and he came up with the idea and they called it smog."" The governor made the claim during a ceremony marking the signing of California’s landmark climate change bill, SB 350. It requires the state to get 50 percent of its electricity from air-friendly, renewable energy sources by 2030. We decided to fact-check Brown’s ""smog was invented in Los Angeles"" statement, to cut through what seemed like a dubious claim. Smog checking First, it’s clear L.A. has no ownership over the term smog. Brown sounds like he was having some fun with the ""invented in Los Angeles"" portion, from listening to him speak. Still, he was literally and blatantly wrong. News articles from as early as 1905 credit London doctor Harold Des Veaux with coining the word smog to describe natural fog contaminated by smoke, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. Great Britain’s affliction with foul air is referenced in Shakespeare’s Macbeth, written in 1606. But its soot-choked skies date as far back as the 12th century, when wood became scarce and residents turned to burning coal to keep warm, according to a history of the country’s air pollution by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It’s clear that other urban centers fought the effects of smog long before anyone imagined the metropolis we call Los Angeles. So, what kind of smoke was the governor blowing? ""Jerry Brown -- brilliant as he is -- is confusing some facts,"" said Chip Jacobs, author of Smogtown: The Lung-Burning History of Pollution in Los Angeles. ""We didn’t invent smog. Smog has been known to arise in many parts of the world well before he was born."" We were headed for a False or Pants On Fire! Then, Jacobs added this comment: ""Brown did have something right in his jumbled pronouncement -- the Caltech professor."" Was there some truth behind the governor’s inartful statement? To get a better picture, we contacted the California Institute of Technology, based in Pasadena. School officials confirmed that Brown was referring to a 1940s-era Caltech professor named Arie Haagen-Smit. Haagen-Smit was the first to prove that automobile exhaust, when exposed to sunlight, creates what’s referred to as photochemical smog, or modern-day smog. It’s the same hazy brown gunk that’s polluted Los Angeles’ air for more than half a century. And it is different from the thick, black coal-driven smoke of London’s industrial era. ""Professor Haagen-Smit did not invent (photochemical) smog, but he discovered the mechanism behind it. This has often been described as inventing smog,"" wrote Professor Richard Flagan, who teaches chemical engineering at Caltech, in an email. Another expert on air quality in Los Angeles said the governor’s claim is less murky than it appears. ""The term smog was used earlier, but it meant something totally different. The definition totally morphed,"" said Sarah Elkind, a history professor at San Diego State University. ""Los Angeles was the first city to deal with photo-chemical smog, which is part of the reason why I would judge Gov. Brown’s statement as mostly correct,"" added Elkind, author of the book How Local Politics Shape Federal Policy: Business, Power, and the Environment in Twentieth Century Los Angeles. A spokesman for the governor said in an email that Haagen-Smit ""was the first one who coined the term for the modern air pollution produced by motor vehicles that we think of today."" He also acknowledged that the term smog had been used to describe other types of pollution long before the 1940s. Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown said: ""Smog was invented in Los Angeles. It was. The name was invented. There was a fellow at Caltech and he came up with the idea and they called it smog."" A look at historical sources shows the term smog dates back more than a century. It was coined by a London doctor to refer to the smoky black air that fouled Great Britain during its industrial period. Brown’s statement ignores this history, viewing smog’s origin with only a California lens. But looking deeper, a gradual shift in the term’s meaning took place in the 1940s and 1950s as scientists, including Caltech professor Arie Haagen-Smit, studied the cause of Los Angeles’ persistent and foul brown haze. In his statement, the governor references Haagen-Smit, who is credited as the first to prove L.A.’s smog was caused by automobile exhaust, and who at least one current Caltech professor says is ""often described as inventing smog."" The governor’s statement, while fuzzy at first glance, is partially accurate. But it leaves out important details and takes information out of context. We rate the claim Half True.

""We called in, we said, that’s it, we’re not doing it,"" Trump said. ""They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn’t be done. Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three-and-a-half, including (CNBC). And in about two minutes, I renegotiated it down to two hours so we could get the hell out of here."" Moderator John Harwood disagreed and said, ""Just for the record, the debate was always going to be two hours."" But Trump held his ground: ""That is absolutely not right. You know that. That is not right."" So is Trump right, or is Harwood? We found that Trump is embellishing his story. Three hours? CNBC first announced the debate Sept. 30, but the negotiations over logistics didn’t happen until mid October. A September press release said ""candidates will take the stage at 8PM ET for two hours of debate."" While this bolsters Harwood’s claim, this count didn’t include commercial time -- so there would be a certain amount of time for advertising on top of the two hours of actual debate. But CNBC never anticipated the whole program would last anywhere near three or more hours. CNBC said the total anticipated commercial time was just 15 minutes, so the whole program (pre-negotiations) would have lasted around two hours and 15 minutes. Two weeks later, some GOP candidates complained about the debate logistics -- notably that there would be no opening or closing remarks, according to news reports. The Trump and Carson campaigns went so far as to send a letter to CNBC’s Washington bureau, threatening to drop out if their demands weren’t met. ""Mr. Trump and Carson do agree to a 120 minute debate that includes commercial breaks and opening and closing statements,"" the Oct. 15 letter reads. ""Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson do not, and will not, agree to appear at a debate that is more than 120 minutes long including commercial breaks."" The letter also indicates that Trump’s campaign was aware the program would last about two hours, even with commercials. ""Specifically, we write because the agenda sent to the campaigns recently by CNBC in partnership with the Republican National Committee (RNC), and reiterated on yesterday’s call, indicated that there would be ‘two hours of debate time’ plus four commercial breaks lasting between two and four minutes each,"" the letter said. The next day, CNBC agreed to cap the program at 120 minutes and for candidates to have 30 seconds at the beginning and the end. We can’t speak to how much of a role Trump directly played in the negotiation. We asked spokespeople at CNBC and the Republican National Committee about this, but neither would talk on the record. However, it’s fair to infer that his threatening to drop out of the debate probably put some pressure on leadership with the RNC and CNBC. In any case, Trump and the Republicans didn’t negotiate down an hour and a half; they negotiated 15 minutes. So in saying ""the debate was always going to be two hours,"" Harwood’s statement was closer to accurate than Trump’s. Our ruling Trump said the CNBC debate was supposed to be three hours, and he ""renegotiated it down to two hours."" Trump played a role -- but not the sole role -- in negotiating the debate program down to two hours, but the plans were for it to last around two hours and 15 minutes -- not three hours or more.

Donald Trump's fracked-up claim on shale's economic impact in Ohio
","In the third Republican debate, Donald Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich got into a fracas over fracking.   It started when debate moderator John Harwood asked Kasich whom he was talking about when Kasich said he’s been hearing ""crazy"" things on the campaign trail. Kasich didn’t name names but listed proposals from the two outsiders leading the GOP field, specifically Trump’s plan to deport 10 million people and Ben Carson’s tithe-based tax policy. ""Folks, we’ve got to wake up. We cannot elect somebody who doesn’t know how to do the job,"" Kasich said on Oct. 28. Trump fired back that Kasich’s record in Ohio wasn’t so good. ""First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, okay?"" Trump retorted. ""He hit oil. He got lucky with fracking. Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well."" ""Ohio does have an energy industry, but we’re diversified,"" Kasich said in response.   Who was right? We reached out to the Trump camp but didn’t hear back. The data suggests and experts told us, however, that Trump is grossly exaggerating fracking’s role in Ohio’s economy. The numbers To refresh, fracking or hydraulic fracturing is the process of blasting pressurized water, sand and chemicals to extract natural gas from shale rock miles underground. Ohio, the birthplace of Standard Oil and the leading producer of crude oil a century ago, sits on parts of two major shale formations. Drilling began in the Utica and Marcellus shales in eastern Ohio in 2010, when the state was facing a projected budget shortfall and when Kasich was elected to office. Ohio is now running a $2 billion surplus. Statistics show that fracking contributed to both jobs and tax revenues in Ohio, but the numbers aren’t overwhelming. Kasich’s spokesperson Rob Nichols pointed to data showing that fracking was responsible for just 2.6 percent of the 278,150 total jobs created in the state during that time period. As for revenue, Nichols said data from Ohio’s Department of Taxation shows that oil and gas industry brought 0.017 percent ($19.89 million) of all state revenue ($118.3 billion) between fiscal years 2014 to 2015. Our own analysis produced similar results. Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found that fracking accounted for 2.3 to 2.5 percent of all jobs created in Ohio between 2010 and 2014. Factoring in jobs created in related industries (i.e. petrochemical engineering or pipe manufacturing) brings up the figure up to 6.9 to 7.9 percent of all jobs. As for revenue, we looked at Ohio Department of Taxation’s annual reports and found that the severance tax imposed on the oil and gas industry contributed to less than 1 percent of tax revenue in Ohio from 2010 to 2014. Policy Matters Ohio, a Cleveland-based liberal think tank, estimates a slightly lower impact. According to their analysis of BLS data, shale jobs represented about 0.26 percent of total employment in Ohio in the first quarter of 2015, and about 2 percent of total jobs added between 2010 and 2015. By comparison, the auto industry added about three and a half times more jobs. ""I’ll admit that I tweeted in outrage at (Trump’s) statement since both parts of it are inaccurate and not borne out by the data,"" said Amy Hanauer, the think tank’s executive director, who also contends that Ohio is actually not doing well. Shale dreams deferred At the beginning of the fracking boom, the oil and gas industry hailed it as ""the biggest thing economically to hit Ohio since maybe the plow,"" in the words of one executive. Shale development, according to industry officials, would bring an estimated $500 billion and 200,000 jobs to the state. But fracking wasn’t as profitable in Ohio as expected, thanks to a slump in the oil prices coupled with low production. ""I would say the growth has been slower than we originally anticipated,"" an oil refinery official acknowledged in 2012, according to Reuters. ""Nothing like those numbers had been seen,"" said Hanauer. ""Employment even in the drilling counties was, at that time, below pre-recession levels.  Sales tax revenue was up significantly, a good thing, but many of those who have found jobs were from out of state."" A 2012 economic analysis sponsored by pro-industry entities — the Ohio Chamber of Commerce and the Ohio Shale Coalition — estimated that shale development would, by 2014, result in an additional 65,000 jobs and just a 1 percent improvement to the state GDP. The 1 percent estimate was ""pretty much on target,"" according to report co-author Douglas Southgate, a professor emeritus of environmental economics and public policy at Ohio State University who says he’s pro-fracking. The overall employment impact, meanwhile, ""has been small enough that not even OOGA — the Ohio Oil and Gas Association — has been talking about it,"" Southgate told us. Even if oil prices pick up again and fracking’s impact grows, its role in Ohio’s economy wouldn’t be as large as Trump is trumpeting it to be. ""Ohio has a far more diverse economy than, say, North Dakota or Oklahoma,"" said Andrew Thomas of Cleveland State University’s Energy Policy Center, the principal investigator of the 2012 report. ""I am skeptical that all growth in the state can be attributed to the oil and gas industry alone."" Kasich’s campaign forwarded us a report from JobsOhio, the state’s privatized economic development agency, to that point:  For the record, not even the drillers themselves back Trump’s claim. Here’s a statement Shawn Bennett, the executive vice president of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, provided to PolitiFact: ""While we appreciate Mr. Trump acknowledging the significant and positive economic impacts that oil and gas development has had on Ohio, we can not take credit for all of the economic growth that has taken place during Gov. Kasich's tenure."" Our ruling Trump said, ""John (Kasich) got lucky with a thing called fracking,"" which ""is why Ohio is doing well"". Though Ohio underwent a fracking boom in recent years, Trump is overstating its impact on Ohio’s economy. By all estimates, fracking jobs account for 2 percent of those added in the state during Kasich’s tenure. Shale development has improved GDP by about 1 percent and contributed to less than a percent of the state’s tax revenue. Not even the drillers themselves back Trump’s claim. We rate it False.

Rand Paul says debt limit deal 'allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money'
","A bipartisan, bicameral deal to stave off a possible government shutdown and a breaching of the federal debt limit is now on its way to President Barack Obama’s desk. But as it was moving toward congressional approval, some Republican presidential candidates spoke out against it during the GOP debate in Boulder, Colo., arguing that it represented an abdication of fiscal responsibility. One of the critics at the debate was Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. ""Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit,"" Paul said. ""It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money."" We wondered if Paul was accurately describing the bill, so we took a closer look. The measure in question is the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. (Here’s a summary.) The part of the bill that Paul is referring to -- section 901 -- would temporarily lift the limit on how much money the federal government is permitted to borrow. If the debt limit had not been lifted, the government wouldn’t have been able to pay its outstanding debts, with potentially serious economic consequences and negative reactions from equity and other markets. Historically, the most common mechanism for raising the debt limit was to set a new cap in dollars. Usually, it was possible to estimate how much time would pass before this limit would be reached, based on expected spending patterns, but it was only an estimate. The current legislation, however, utilizes a mechanism that has been used a few times in the past few years. Rather than setting a new dollar amount, it suspends the debt limit until a date certain -- March 15, 2017, which is a few months after a new president and a new Congress are sworn in. So under the newly passed legislation, there is no longer a dollar limit on how much debt the United States can accrue. However, it’s an exaggeration to say that the measure ""allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money."" To understand why this is so, we’ll take a look at the two types of federal spending -- mandatory spending (which includes both interest on the debt and expenditures commonly known as ""entitlements"") and discretionary spending. Generally speaking, mandatory spending is determined by a fixed formula and continues on autopilot until Congress and the president change the rules. Discretionary spending, by contrast, must be approved periodically in appropriations bills passed by Congress and signed by the president. For mandatory spending, there is no cap on the amount of mandatory spending, only a date in the future when the debt limit is reimposed. That said, mandatory spending is considered unlikely to increase beyond current projections since it is set by formulas that are relatively straightforward to predict. And Paul exaggerates in attributing this spending to Obama. ""Unlimited"" mandatory spending would continue regardless of Obama’s actions. Without a bill to change the formulas driving mandatory spending, passed by Congress and signed by the president, this spending would continue. One big example of mandatory spending is Medicare, the popular government-run health insurance program for those over age 65. Paul’s comment is even more inaccurate as it concerns discretionary spending -- the kind of spending that Obama can more directly affect (though even then only with the consent of Congress). The legislation, in addition to temporarily suspending the debt ceiling, forestalled the immediate possibility of a government shutdown, which could have occurred if spending authority for federal agencies had expired. It did this by outlining new discretionary spending levels for the next two fiscal years. The legislation raises the maximum amount the government can spend on both the military and nonmilitary categories of discretionary spending for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. But while this is an increase, it’s not an unlimited increase. Discretionary spending is capped, and unless Obama and the Republican-controlled Congress agree to raise those limits through new legislation, it won’t go any higher than the spending caps in the bill. Our ruling Paul said the debt limit deal ""allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money."" Under the just-passed legislation, there is no specific dollar amount of debt that the United States can incur between now and March 15, 2017. But discretionary spending is indeed limited by the same bill. Mandatory spending, meanwhile, can be considered unlimited, but that is not something that Obama has unilateral power over, as Paul’s claim suggests. This mandatory spending is set by longstanding formulas, which can only be changed by Obama in concert with both chambers of Congress. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2015/nov/02/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-debt-limit-deal-allows-president-ob/

McAuliffe says 40 percent of U.S. gun sales escape background checks
","Gov. Terry McAuliffe recently issued an executive order that banned firearms from most state buildings and offered his rationale for a gun control measure he plans to present to the General Assembly this winter. McAuliffe, a Democrat, is calling for a law that would require all prospective gun buyers in Virginia to undergo a background check to determine whether the purchaser has a disqualifying criminal record or mental health history. Although the governor long has supported this action, his intensity grew after the Aug. 26 fatal shootings of Roanoke television reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward near Smith Mountain Lake. Virginia law now requires all licensed gun dealers - those in the business of selling arms - to conduct computerized checks on buyers. But sales between individuals are exempt and that, McAuliffe says, opens a loophole for guns to fall into the wrong hands. A federal law requiring background checks has the same exemption. ""It has been estimated that nearly 40 percent of all guns sold in America are sold by private, unlicensed sellers either online or through guns shows,"" McAuliffe stated in his Oct. 15 executive order.   Christina Nuckols, deputy press secretary for McAuliffe, said the source of the 40 percent figure is a 1997 study by the National Institute of Justice that looked at gun owners’ responses to a 1994 national survey asking how they got their weapons. The study found that 30 percent to 40 percent of all gun transactions were made through an ""off-the-books"" transfer in which a background check wasn’t required. The finding has been cited widely by gun control advocates - including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D- Va. - in calling for a federal law mandating universal background checks. But as we and other fact checkers have noted previously, the research is old and limited. Consider: McAuliffe’s statement misses a key distinction in the study: The research looked at all gun transactions - including when a gun was obtained as a gift or as an inheritance - and not just being ""sold,"" as the governor said. The Fact Checker at The Washington Post in 2013 asked one of the co-authors of the study, Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago, to crunch the 1994 data just looking at sales. Ludwig replied that 14 percent to 22 percent of guns were purchased without a background check. The 1994 data, we also should note, did not have a category for online sales, as McAuliffe’s statement suggests. Earlier this year, we asked the other co-author of the report, Philip Cook of Duke University, what percentage of guns currently are sold without a background check. In response, he sent us an op-ed that he and Ludwig wrote in the National Review after the December 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. - a time when the 40 percent figure was circulating again.   ""We’ve been following the give-and-take with some interest because our research is the original source of the 40-percent statistic,"" they wrote. ""Our views may come as a surprise: First, we don’t know the current percentage - nor does anyone else."" The lack of current data is due largely because federal funding for gun studies dried up two decades ago. President Barack Obama issued a memorandum in 2013 directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to re-examine gun violence. We also should note that Virginia doesn’t keep data about private guns, said Corinne Geller, communications manager for the state police. As a result, we recently gave a False rating to a statement by state Sen. Tommy Norment, R-James City, that only 2 percent of Virginia gun sales are exempt from background checks. The fact is, nobody knows. Our ruling McAuliffe said, ""It has been estimated that nearly 40 percent of all guns sold in America are sold by private, unlicensed sellers either online or through gun shows."" His source is a small-sample survey from 1994 that included firearms that were sold and those that were given as gifts or inheritances. When the results were adjusted to guns sold - the term McAuliffe uses - only 14 percent to 22 percent of the firearms were sold without background checks. The researchers say they ""don’t know"" if their findings are relevant today. No current national study has been published. McAuliffe did not acknowledge these points, all of which have been reported widely. So we rate his statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/nov/02/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-40-percent-gun-sales-escape-backgro/

Electric car sales hit the brakes as tax credit axed and fee added
","The Georgia General Assembly earlier this year pulled the plug on one of the nation’s most generous state tax credits for electric cars. At the same time, state lawmakers voted to impose a $200 annual registration fee on owners of some plug-in hybrids and all zero-emissions vehicles to make up for the gas taxes those motorists don’t pay and to help fund a backlog of road projects. Both changes took effect July 1, and already, preliminary numbers show sales of the Nissan Leaf and other electric cars are plummeting, Don Francis, coordinator of the Clean Cities-Georgia Coalition, said in an interview published Oct. 28 at Watchdog.org. New electric car registrations in Georgia fell 89 percent from 1,338 in June, the last month that the tax credit was available, to 148 in August, Francis said. Sound surprising? Maybe not. True? PolitiFact decided to dig deeper. First, we’ll provide some background. Georgia started providing a tax credit for electric car purchases in 1998. Initially, businesses and individuals were offered a tax credit up to $1,500 as incentive to buy alternative-fuel vehicles. Two years later, the credit was upped to $2,500 for all low-emission vehicles, and in 2001, it was doubled to $5,000 for zero-emission vehicles. By comparison, Louisiana and Maryland offer a credit up to $3,000, and Utah gives up to $1,500. All three states limit the tax credit to vehicle purchases. Georgia’s $5,000 credit meant huge savings for state residents who wanted to buy or even lease an electric car -- especially when coupled with a federal tax credit that could be as much as $7,500, depending on the capacity of the vehicle’s battery. Those who wanted to get rid of the tax credit said that the double tax credits were excessive and allowing Atlanta yuppies to lease electric cars, including the $30,000 Leaf, for as little as $100 a month. Supporters said the tax credit made Georgia one of the top states for electric cars, a positive step especially in metro Atlanta where air pollution from auto emissions has been a persistent problem. Statewide, electric car ownership has jumped dramatically just in the past couple of years.. According to the state Revenue Department, 1,743 electric cars were riding the roads of Georgia in 2012. By 2014, that number had soared to 15,729, or an increase of 802 percent, with two-thirds of them parking outside homes in metro Atlanta’s four biggest counties -- Fulton (4,288), Cobb (2,397), Gwinnett (2,087) and DeKalb (2,067). Proposals to eliminate the tax credit went nowhere in 2013 and 2014. But in this year’s legislative session, when raising $1 billion for transportation projects was a priority, budget analysts said cutting the tax credit for electric cars would bring in $66 million by 2016 and nearly $190 million by 2020. Supporters of the tax credit touted a private study that said, without the tax credit, Georgia’s economy would lose $252 million in the next 16 years. What the numbers say We began our fact check by contacting Francis, who opposed abolishing the state tax credit during this year’s General Assembly session. Francis shared with PolitiFact a spreadsheet that he developed based on motor vehicle data he obtained from a national automotive information company. The data showed a spike in Georgia’s electric car sales in the months between when lawmakers voted to kill the tax credit and when it officially expired July 1. Sales declined sharply in July, going from 1,338 in June to 776, and fell even more, to 149, in August, the last month for which data are available, Francis said. ""When you were selling an average of just over 1,000 (cars) a month and then it goes to 150 a month, you have to say: ‘What changed?’"" Francis said. ""Two things changed: The tax credit went away, and the $200 fee was added."" We contacted officials at IHS Automotive, the company where Francis received the data used in the spreadsheet, and asked it to review the accuracy of his information. Michelle Culver, senior manager for corporate communications at IHS, said via an email that ""we did a spot check on this, and it is our data and accurate."" We also decided to find out what the Georgia Department of Revenue, the agency in charge of vehicle registrations in the state, was seeing. William Gaston, the department’s spokesman, sent us data on new car sales, rather than new car registrations. The reason, he said, was an owner could register a vehicle after July 1 but have purchased it before the deadline and thus qualify for the tax credit. Revenue Department numbers and Francis’ data brought us to the same conclusion -- sales of electric cars have done a nosedive. Specifically, Georgians purchased 5,434 zero-emissions vehicles -- or an average of 905 a month -- from Jan. 1 to June 30 of this year, when the $5,000 tax credit was available. Between July 1 and Sept. 30 -- when the state tax credit was no longer available -- 439 electric cars were sold, or about 149 per month. Our ruling: Don Francis, coordinator of the Clean Cities-Georgia Coalition, said electric car sales in Georgia have dropped dramatically since a $5,000 tax credit was eliminated and a $200 annual registration fee was imposed July 1. That statement is backed up by data available so far on new car registrations and new car sales. Keep in mind that car sales spiked as people rushed to buy before the credit expired July 1, and that makes the post-July 1 drop in sales look that much more shocking. Whether that trend holds remains to be seen. But everything we found so far indicates Francis is on the money. We therefore rate his statement as True.",/factchecks/2015/nov/02/don-francis/electric-car-sales-hit-brakes-tax-credit-axed-and-/
