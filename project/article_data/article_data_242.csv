Tom Barrett says gubernatorial rival Scott Walker eliminated economic development office during recession
","
In the wake of a major recession, and with state unemployment stubbornly high, there’s little surprise jobs have been a central focus in the Wisconsin governor’s race.

Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, the Democratic nominee, is faulted by Republicans for job losses in the city. And Barrett is slamming Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker, his GOP rival, for not doing enough from his office -- and even doing more harm than good.

In a new television ad, titled ""The Difference is Jobs,"" Barrett makes this claim:

Scott Walker ""eliminated his own office of economic development in the middle of this recession.""

That’s a pretty strong shot. But is it true?

Let’s start with the recession piece of this:

While economic times are still unquestionably tough, the official time frame for the Great Recession is December 2007 through June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.

The Barrett campaign is basing its claim on Walker’s two most recent budgets, for 2009 and 2010.

In the 2009 budget, introduced in September 2008, Walker eliminated the county’s Economic Development Department, moved the seven staff members to other departments and downgraded the director position to a lower level bureaucrat.

""We didn’t eliminate the office that office as much as reassign it,"" Walker said, when asked about the claim. He noted that the economic development activities already were limited -- such as handling real estate deals, low income housing and block grants.

""It represents more of a realistic expectation of what the county is doing,"" Walker said at the time the office was moved. ""We still very much want to play a role.""

In the fall of 2009, Walker switched gears and proposed creating a new county office of business development within his own office as part of the 2010 budget. He called for three staff members and a director. But the County Board approved only the position for the director, deleting the staffers. And it put the post in the Department of Transportation and Public Works.

So, while the Barrett TV ad focuses on Walker’s action, it leaves out an important detail: the board’s involvement in approving -- or blocking -- the executive’s proposals.

Additionally, the ad leaves the impression the county has played a large role in economic development.

To be sure, there are economic development issues facing the county, from development of the County Grounds in Wauwatosa, to the sale of county land in the Park East Corridor in downtown Milwaukee, and increased interest in the area surrounding booming Mitchell International Airport.

But the county has never placed as high a priority on economic development as the city, which has many more tools at its disposal to induce projects, including controls over zoning and the ability to create special tax financing districts. The Department of City Development is one of the most powerful -- and largest -- departments at City Hall.

We turned to Bill Drew for a little insight.

Drew is director of the Milwaukee County Research Park on the County Grounds in Wauwatosa. In the past, he served as commissioner of city development and also was director of administration for a time at the county, under former County Executive F. Thomas Ament’s administration. (He has contributed $1,000 to Walker’s gubernatorial campaign).  

What role should the county play?

""The county has struggled to come up with an answer,"" Drew said. ""We’ve been in and out of that business in one way or another since the early ’90s.""

The situation is exacerbated by fighting between the board and the executive.

""It’s the culture of the institution that is causing a problem,"" Drew said. The board and executive have to agree ""on the same vision and make a commitment that’s longer than one year.""

Drew said there hasn’t been a professional economic development specialist at the county since Tim Casey, now economic development coordinator in Brookfield, held the post in the 1990s.

Under Walker, two of his recent selections to lead economic development efforts -- Bob Dennik and Tim Russell -- came from his campaign organization and didn’t last long.

While Barrett’s claim is very specific -- on whether the department was eliminated -- it aims to make a broader point: That Walker has not done what he could have done when it comes to jobs.

So we will delve a little deeper into how the position has been handled.

After the battle over reinstating the office in 2010, Walker could have filled the position starting in January. In August, he hired Damon Dorsey. There was no official announcement of the hiring. It did not become public until it appeared on a County Board committee agenda.

Most recently, Dorsey had worked for the administration of outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle on a proposed $810 million high-speed rail connection -- opposed by Walker -- between Milwaukee and Madison. He made $25 an hour, or $52,200 a year, to assist getting communities involved along the rail line.

In the county job, he will make $80,500 a year.

Dorsey is the former leader of the North Avenue Community Development Corp., which developed several apartment and retail buildings in the central city. In 2007, he developed a commercial building at N. 37th St. and W. North Ave. for a custard and burger stand called Scoopz that was publicly financed in part by the Milwaukee Economic Development Corp. and state Department of Commerce.

The business closed after less than a year, and Dorsey and his wife, Maria, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2009. That case has since been closed. As part of the bankruptcy, Dorsey was required to take a personal financial management class, a routine hurdle required by federal law.

Dorsey said the Scoopz experience shows that he understands the challenges facing businesses in this economic climate.

""I’ve been on the front lines of the war,"" he said. ""I’ve seen the blood.""

So, let’s return to the job -- and claim -- at hand.

To draw a contrast on the critical issue of jobs, Tom Barrett says Scott Walker shut down his economic development office in the midst of a recession. The office did disappear, but in less than a year Walker was already trying to reinstate it -- though the County Board sliced back his plans. While the Barrett TV ad leaves the impression the county’s department was large, economic development has never been a major priority or function of the county.

Cagle budget claim gets scrutiny
","
There are some things you just don't do if you want to be considered a conservative politician. Raising taxes is at the top of the list.

Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle has proudly told audiences that Georgia leaders, amid one of the worst economic periods in American history, passed a budget this spring without raising taxes. Cagle, a Republican running for re-election, bragged about this at a Sept. 4 GOP rally in Carroll County, giving some of the credit to Gov. Sonny Perdue.

""[Perdue] was able to help us balance the budget without raising taxes on the residents of Georgia,"" Cagle said, according to the Times-Georgian newspaper in Carrollton.

Some AJC PolitiFact Georgia readers have questioned the claim in recent weeks and asked us to check it out. Carol Porter, Cagle's Democratic opponent in the Nov. 2 election, cut a television commercial this week calling out her opponent.

""Casey Cagle raised our taxes during a recession,"" a voice says over ominous music.

There are three main points of debate about Cagle's statement.

The first is centered on House Bill 1055. It is 84 pages of legalese that raises fees on many items. Most are for services not used by the average Georgian, such as the licensing fee for a fertilizer distributor. Some, however, included the annual fee to register a business in Georgia, the cost for a personalized license plate and fees to run a child care business. Combined, the fee increases are estimated to collect an additional $90 million over a year.

Some say a fee increase is simply a politician using a different word for a tax increase. Others disagree. It's a longtime argument. Webster's defines a tax as ""a charge, usually of money, imposed by an authority on persons or property for public purposes."" Webster's says a fee is ""a sum paid or charged for a service."" University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock considers a fee as the cost for a service people can choose to use or not. He contends a tax is for a service that serves a general purpose, such as public schools or roads.

Kelly McCutchen, president of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, a conservative think tank, defines a fee as a charge that covers the cost of providing a service. He says a tax is when the government collects revenue that is greater than the cost of providing the service. 

Alan Essig, executive director of the liberal-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, also believes it is not accurate to say not providing the credit is a tax increase.

""What was taken out of the [state] budget was an appropriation,"" said Essig, a former state budget analyst. ""It was a local tax that you give a credit to.""

Clint Mueller, the legislative director for the Association County Commissioners of Georgia, agreed.

""They didn't force the [property tax] rate to go up,"" he said of the Legislature. ""It was the elimination of the credit. ... Technically, it's not a tax increase.""

Still, the bottom line is that many Georgia homeowners will pay more for their property taxes. We found this the most persuasive argument.

So where does that leave us? It's clear that there was no direct, across-the-board tax increase on Georgians. Some of the discussion turns into a semantic debate concerning what's a fee and what's a tax -- and whether there's truly a difference. We won't be able to settle that here. On the tax relief grant, while its demise wasn't technically a tax increase, the effect is that Georgia property owners are paying more. In all, we found Cagle's statement accurate but needs clarification on the tax relief grant. By the definition of our Truth-o-Meter, that rates as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/15/casey-cagle/cagle-budget-claim-gets-scrutiny/

Jason Isaac calls state Rep. Patrick Rose a ""liberal thorn in our side"" on spending, taxes, health care
","
Playing on his foe's name, Republican Texas House nominee Jason Isaac calls fourth-term Democratic Rep. Patrick Rose a ""liberal thorn in our side.""

In a video ad that debuted online Oct. 7, Isaac lists pointed reasons to yank Rose, who's in his fourth term. Rose, the narrator says, ""votes with the liberals 90 percent of the time, ...backed the largest tax increase in Texas history... (and) proposed nearly $15 billion in new government spending."" The narrator adds: ""Rose even supported an Obama-style government-run health care system for Texas.""

The Truth-O-Meter analyzed the biggest-tax-increase charge earlier this year when U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison laid it on Gov. Rick Perry. We rated False Hutchison's statement that the state's revamped business tax amounted to the largest tax increase Texas has ever had. In checking Hutchison's statement, we noted that her campaign said the revised franchise tax, often called the margins tax, cost taxpayers $8.8 billion in 2008-09. Her camp compared that figure with the estimated $5.7 billion tax package signed into law in 1987 by Gov. Bill Clements. At the time, that increase was widely reported to be the largest tax hike in Texas history.

There were fatal flaws in Hutchison's math. For instance, the $8.8 billion figure is the total amount generated by the franchise tax, not the net increase resulting from the revision that became law under Perry. The actual increase — revenue above what the old franchise tax would have brought in — was about $3 billion, significantly less than what had been projected.

We compared that with the largest single piece of the Clements-era tax package: a hike in the sales tax. After it was enacted, sales tax revenues went up $4.2 billion during 1988-89 compared with the previous biennium.

Isaac's campaign consultant, Corbin Casteel, cited the same 2006 tax law, House Bill 3, as the basis for Isaac's ""largest ever"" claim. Casteel also referred us to the same source referenced by Hutchison, a Dallas Morning News blog post that doesn't that doesn't specify how the paper compared 2006 changes in business and tobacco taxes to past tax hikes. Meantime, two experts we contacted--Dale Craymer of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association and Talmadge Heflin of the conservative-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation--independently told us the 2006 tax changes did not amount to Texas history's largest increase.

But what of Isaac's other not-rosy claims?

Casteel said the reference to Rose voting with ""the liberals"" 90 percent of the time was backed up by an analysis of House votes by Mark P. Jones, who chairs Rice University's political science department.

Casteel guided us to a Texas Tribune chart based on Jones' work showing that Rose is the 68th most liberal of the House's 150 members and the 7th-most conservative Democrat.

We didn't find an indication Rose had mostly voted with liberals, so we called Jones, who said that there's nothing in his research, based on Rose's votes throughout his House career, to justify the 90-percent statement. While Rose ""votes in a more liberal manner than any Republican in the House,"" Jones said, ""he will be one of the five most conservative Democrats if he comes back.""

We alerted Casteel to Jones' interpretation; he then shared another way of breaking down Rose's voting record -- based solely on 561 Rose votes during the 2009 legislative session. A research sheet prepared for Isaac's campaign says the selected votes don't include opening-bell procedural votes or votes when no one voted ""no."" It doesn't specify each vote.

The sheet says Rose voted with 11 Democratic colleagues identified as ""most liberal"" on the Tribune chart 87 to 92 percent of the time, voting 90 percent or more often with six colleagues in the ""most liberal"" category: Reps. David Leibowitz of San Antonio, Eddie Rodriguez of Austin, Jim Dunnam of Waco and Alma Allen, Garnet Coleman and Ana Hernandez of Houston. In contrast, Isaac's sheet says, Rose voted like the former Republican House speaker, Rep. Tom Craddick of Midland, 65 percent of the time.

Back to the professor... Jones said via e-mail that Isaac's camp correctly identified the ""most liberal"" members using his research. But he said they used a less sophisticated approach by including votes not necessarily reflective of ideology.

Casteel said Isaac's statement about Rose proposing nearly $15 billion in spending is based on the projected costs of proposals authored by Rose in the 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009 legislative sessions; spreadsheets Casteel provided to us indicate that Rose offered 96 measures over those years that together would have cost the state nearly $14.4 billion through six years.

But did they? We asked which of the Rose proposals passed into law. Casteel countered that Isaac was talking about what Rose wanted to spend--not what he passed into law.

Why six years, since legislators typically only focus on two years of spending at a time? (That's the length of the budget adopted every odd-numbered year.) Casteel said Isaac's statement relies on the six-year spending forecasts because that's what Rose's ideas would have cost taxpayers over the longer term.

Casteel said Isaac's statement that Rose ""supported an Obama-style government-run health care system for Texas"" refers to a May 21, 2007 floor vote. Online legislative records show that Rose was among 51 members to vote against tabling a proposal by Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, directing the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to prepare a report ""detailing the means by which this state could insure the maximum number of people and eventually implement a system of universal health care."" The motion to table prevailed, killing Burnam's amendment.

All in all, does Isaac's prickly statement draw blood?

Isaac's largest-tax-increase claim is incorrect. And while Isaac's method of counting votes indicates that Rose votes 90 percent of the time with House liberals, it's based on research conducted by a university professor who says Isaac's message -- that Rose's ideology swings liberal -- isn't justified by Rose's career voting record.

Per Isaac's spending charge, the tally of what Rose's proposals would have cost is closer to $14 billion than the nearly $15 billion Isaac proclaims. Also, adding up projected costs over six years--rather than the two years covered by each budget--isn't how lawmakers usually weigh fiscal implications.

Isaac's statement that Rose ""supported an Obama-style government-run health care system for Texas,"" reflects Rose's vote against ending debate on a proposal calling for a report on how the state could implement a ""universal health care"" system. Ordering a feasibility report on universal health care--in action, ahem, more than a  year before Obama won election as president--is not the same as endorsing a particular system.

We rate Isaac's four-part sally Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",/factchecks/2010/oct/15/jason-isaac/jason-isaac-says-state-rep-patrick-rose-votes-libe/

John Kitzhaber claims Chris Dudley finds Oregon’s minimum wage too high
","
What Chris Dudley thinks of Oregon’s minimum wage -- is it too low, too high, or just right? -- has been one of the more contested issues in Oregon’s heated race for governor.

John Kitzhaber, the Democrat, has released a television ad claiming that Dudley thinks waitresses make too much and that the minimum wage is a problem for Oregon’s struggling economy. The Democratic Party of Oregon followed up with a press release saying that Dudley was caught on camera agreeing with a person who thinks the wage is too high.

In Kitzhaber’s jaunty 30-second spot, the announcer describes Dudley as a wealth strategist who wants to give huge tax breaks to the rich. Then, it cuts to a clip of Dudley at a Sept. 9 , 201o, event at Intel in Hillsboro. The text of his words appear on screen: ""Restaurants will say ... it doesn’t make sense that our waitresses are getting tips ... plus the highest minimum wage in the country."" However, the audio does not have him saying the part about ""restaurants will say.""

The commercial then cuts again to Dudley saying, at the same event, ""... having the highest minimum wage in the country negatively impacts the state.""

Both camps have been urging PolitiFact Oregon to rule on the question of what Dudley said about the minimum wage. So we will.

Some background: Oregon has the second highest minimum wage in the country, after Washington state. And the hourly rate is set to increase another 10 cents, to $8.50 an hour, on Jan. 1.  Oregon is one of 10 states where the wage is adjusted every year, pegged to inflation. (Last year, the minimum was not increased because inflation was flat.)  The ballot measure ensuring such increases was approved by voters in 2002.

The restaurant association and the farm bureau, which support Dudley, have long complained bitterly about Oregon’s minimum wage.  The restaurant lobby in Oregon and elsewhere has pushed for short-term training wages to pay first-time workers.

Dudley said later at the Intel exchange that he would like to look into a training wage program to get young workers job experience without burdening employers.  Democrats say that’s further evidence that Dudley wants to lower Oregon’s minimum wage. Dudley’s camp says that’s not necessarily true since they could set up a system where the state makes up the difference between the minimum wage and a training wage.

Let’s start with a fuller transcript of the exchange Dudley had with the questioner. (And by the way, the Democratic Party of Oregon released the video and has been shopping it around to showcase Dudley’s uber-rich leanings.)
  
Questioner: ""My question comes back to labor and labor costs. I’ve noticed that our state tends to have a very high minimum wage and I think that’s difficult for our businesses but I think it, it also attracts people from other states to come to our state and take our jobs away from our kids and, and those that might need them.  I think it attracts the wrong end of the labor pool to  our  state, and they tend to stay here and ... I’m concerned about that, I’m interested to know what your - if you share that philosophy and if you have any idea what you would do about that or if you want to address that issue.""    
Dudley at first says, "" I agree with you on that issue."" He then goes on to say, ""having the highest minimum wage in the country negatively impacts the state,"" and ""you talk to restaurants, restaurants will say, listen, we’ve got less employees than we would otherwise because of this and it doesn’t make sense ..."" He goes on to mention restaurant kitchen workers who don’t get tips and says ""there’s so many negative issues with it that I think need to be addressed."" 
It’s fair to say his 72-second response was unscripted and a bit rambling. But it is clear that he agreed with the questioner that Oregon’s high minimum wage causes problems for the business community. 

Dudley spokesman Jake Suski said his boss ""was agreeing that there is some economic theory supporting the question."" As for the part about whether wait staff earn too much, Suski says Dudley was ""explaining what restaurants have told him, not offering his own opinion."" Suski said Dudley does not want to lower Oregon’s minimum wage and he does not think servers earn too much.

Dudley’s comments at Intel have dogged him on the campaign trail. The issue came up in a Sept. 28 meeting with The Oregonian’s Editorial Board, where he said he wanted to look at the minimum wage in light of high unemployment among young people.  

In the only debate between the two candidates on Sept. 30, Kitzhaber indicated that Dudley was more concerned about waitresses and their tips than sound fiscal policy. Dudley responded forcefully: ""I’ve never said I wanted to reduce the minimum wage and I’m not. End of story. Not reducing the minimum wage. End of story.""

Dudley’s current, clearer message leaves the distinct impression that, at least when it comes to what he said about waitresses and tips, he probably wishes he could eat his words.

But is Kitzhaber right? Does Dudley, in his heart of hearts, think Oregon’s minimum wage is too high, too low or just right?

PolitiFact Oregon put the question to the Dudley camp. It took a couple of tries, but we might have an answer.

""That's not the issue, he has clearly said he won't lower it and that the voters have decided on this issue,"" Suski said in an initial e-mail. Then he wrote in a second e-mail:  ""He doesn't believe that the minimum wage is too high and he's clearly not in favor of lowering it...""

So if he thinks the minimum wage is not too high, why not say that to the person who asked the question?

Suski responded: ""He just acknowledged the economic theory around it and said he's not making an issue of it.  What he wants to address is youth unemployment and getting young people opportunities in the workforce, which is why he's been talking about a credit for employers to hire young workers.""

If we had a Duck-O-Meter, PolitiFact Oregon would rate this a Full Duck. Dudley said he ""agrees"" with the questioner on the issue, but now his campaign says he was merely acknowledging a theory.

But if Dudley is ducking, Kitzhaber is stretching. Oregon Democrats and Kitzhaber go too far in claiming that Dudley thinks waitresses make too much money and that he wants to lower the minimum wage. Nevertheless, any reasonable person watching the original exchange would believe that Dudley agrees the minimum wage is too high or, at the least, problematic -- despite what his camp says now. We rate the claim Half True.

Rep. Betty Sutton cries 'voter beware' in ad against GOP opponent Tom Ganley
","
Tom Ganley's success in selling cars helped make him Ohio's largest dealer. It made him rich enough to put more than $3.4 million into financing his Republican congressional campaign against Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton in the 13th Congressional District.

Sutton has less than a quarter of his war chest. She and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee are countering by challenging the practices that Ganley used to build his wealth and automotive empire.

Sutton’s TV ad ""Buyer,"" posted on YouTube Sept. 21, uses the theme ""buyer beware"" and says:
  
  

Sutton makes the claim that Ganley is a ""dishonest car sales­man."" That’s a statement of opinion that PolitiFact Ohio can’t rate. But we can check her numbers and try to put them in perspective.

We did find that Ganley was named in well over 400 suits in Cuyahoga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage and Summit counties, dating back to 1979. That number, though, when weighted for volume and time in operation, appeared to be comparable with the record of four other large auto groups we examined.

A Plain Dealer story before last spring’s primary election reported that Ganley dealerships face suits from employees for age, racial and sex discrimination. Ganley’s campaign characterized them as disgruntled employees.

Many of the dozens of lawsuits from customers were filed under the Ohio Lemon Law. Lemon Law cases involve manufacturing and repair problems and do not necessarily reflect on the way a dealer does business. But most Lemon Law cases are filed against dealers, in addition to manufacturers, though the law does not require it.

Ganley dealerships have been sued for selling damaged cars as new and lending a potential buyer a car that had been reported stolen.

Some of the consumer lawsuits involve the dealer practice of offering a ""conditional delivery agreement"" or ""spot delivery agreement,"" which permits a consumer to take a new vehicle home before financing has been approved.

Buyers Jeffrey and Stacy Felix claim they took home a new SUV, at Ganley’s insistence, after being told they were approved for zero percent financing. More than a month later, the couple said, they were told the rate was being moved to 9.44 percent.

Their suit, and others, additionally claimed that Ganley violated Ohio's Consumer Sales Practices Act with a purchase contract containing a mandatory arbitration clause. That clause required  any dispute between the buyer and dealer to be resolved by binding arbitration.

The judge in Felix vs. Ganley Chevrolet, agreed that the clause was misleading, unfair and deceptive enough to be classified under Ohio law as ""unconscionable,"" and therefore unenforceable.

Ganley’s campaign spokeswoman Meghan Snyder noted -- accurately -- that Ganley or Ganley Automotive was named as the plaintiff and not the defendant in some suits. She said that ""90 cases were dismissed without prejudice,"" and that 98 of the cases against Ganley also named a manufacturer and related to the Ohio Lemon Law.

""Over his 42 years in business, Mr. Ganley has sold 585,211 cars, served 1,501,715 service, parts and body customers, and had a total of 5,486 employees,"" Snyder said. ""He stands proudly behind his record of serving and employing Northeast Ohioans over the past six decades.""

We repeat: We are not rating the ad’s statement about Ganley’s honesty.

But Sutton’s claim that he has been ""sued over 400 times"" and that a judge described his business practices ""deceptive and unconscionable"" checks out. Recognizing that he has been in business more than four decades and is Ohio’s largest car dealer are additional pieces of information not in the ad that help put the numbers into perspective.

We rate her ad claim as Mostly True.

Christine O'Donnell claims Chris Coons has ""Marxist beliefs""
","
She's a witch? He's a bearded Marxist?

Never a dull moment in the Delaware Senate race between Republican Christine O'Donnell and Democrat Chris Coons.

For anyone who took the witchcraft thing seriously (based on comments O'Donnell made on Bill Maher's former show, ""Politically Incorrect"" in 1999), O'Donnell addressed that with one of the strangest opening lines of a campaign ad, ever: ""I am not a witch.""

Coons meanwhile has been accused of being a ""bearded Marxist,"" based on an article he wrote in college. He hasn't addressed that claim in an ad, but he has taken time to clarify that he is a ""clean-shaven capitalist"" in several national TV interviews.

O'Donnell is apparently not buying it. She repeated the Marxist accusation in an Oct. 13, 2010, debate.

""I would be remiss not to bring up the fact that my opponent has recently said that it was studying under a Marxist professor that made him become a Democrat,"" O'Donnell said. ""So when you look at his position on things like raising taxes, which is one of the tenets of Marxism; not supporting eliminating death tax, which is a tenet of Marxism -- I would argue that there are more people who support my Catholic faith than his Marxist beliefs, and I’m using his own words.""

The origin of the Marxism charge is an opinion piece Coons wrote for the Amherst College student newspaper during his senior year. The headline: ""Chris Coons: The Making Of A Bearded Marxist.""

This is undoubtedly the kind of thing that makes an opposition researcher scream ""Cha-ching!""

But you don't have to read too far into the article to get that the ""Bearded Marxist"" line is hyperbole.

The article, which ran in the Amherst Student on May 23, 1985, describes Coons' transformation from ""somewhat of a Republican fanatic"" -- who helped found the Amherst College Republicans in 1983 -- to an ardent Democrat, largely as a result of his experiences spending a semester in Kenya during his junior year.

""I spent the spring of my junior year in Africa on the St. Lawrence Kenya Study Program,"" Coons wrote. ""Going to Kenya was one of the few real decisions I have made; my friends, family, and professors all advised against it, but I went anyway. My friends now joke that something about Kenya, maybe the strange diet, or the tropical sun, changed my personality; Africa to them seems a catalytic converter that takes in clean-shaven, clear-thinking Americans and sends back bearded Marxists.""

For those who missed the ""friends now joke"" part, we note that the article is accompanied by a picture of Coons in a jacket and tie with the caption, ""A clean-shaven Christopher Coons.""

Here's how Coons responded when asked about the article during the Oct. 13, 2010, debate:

""I hope folks will go and read the article,"" Coons said. ""It’s an article that I wrote as a senior the day of our commencement speech, and the title and the content of that clearly makes it obvious that it was a joke. There was a group of folks who I had shared a room with, my roommates junior year, who are in the Young Republican Club and who thought when I returned from Kenya and registered as a Democrat that doing so was proof that I had gone all the way over to the far left end, and so they jokingly called me a bearded Marxist. If you take five minutes and read the article, it's clear on the face of it, it was a joke. Despite that, my opponent and lots of folks in the right wing media have endlessly spun this. I am not now, nor have I ever been, anything but a clean-shaven capitalist.""

Said O'Donnell: ""Well, I would stand to disagree because, first of all, if you're saying what I said on a comedy show is relevant to this election, then absolutely you writing an article, forget the bearded Marxist comment, you writing an article saying that you learned your beliefs from an articulate, intelligent Marxist professor and that's what made you become a Democrat, that should send chills up the spine of every Delaware voter because then if you compare that statement to your policies ... ""

""If it were accurate, if it were true, I’d agree."" Coons shot back. ""But it's not accurate. It's not true.""

In his 1985 article, Coons did praise a Marxist professor he had in Kenya, but he didn't say that what he learned from the professor is what made him become a Democrat. In fact, Coons said in the article that the seeds for change predated his semester in Kenya.

""The point that others ignore is that I was ready to change,"" Coons wrote. ""Experiences at Amherst my first two years made me skeptical and uncomfortable with Republicanism, enough so that I wanted to see the Third World for myself to get some perspective on my beliefs. Certainly Kenya provided a needed catalyst; I saw there poverty and oppression more naked than any in America, and I studied under a bright and eloquent Marxist professor at the University of Nairobi. Nevertheless, it is only too easy to return from Africa glad to be an American and smugly thankful for our wealth and freedom. Instead, Amherst had taught me to question, so in return I questioned Amherst, and America.""

He also credits several professors at Amherst with challenging his political perspective.

""More importantly, during my sophomore year, several professors challenged the basic assumptions about America and world relations with which I had grown up. Cultural Anthropology inspired a fascination with other peoples and undermined the accepted value of progress and cultural superiority of the West. In examining the role of 'myths' in primitive cultures, we also studied the myth of equal opportunity in this country, a myth I had never questioned.

""I came to suspect, through these and other courses, that the ideal of America as a 'beacon of freedom and justice, providing hope for the world' was not exactly based on reality.""

Coons wrote that he came to Kenya wondering, ""Can private enterprise and democracy solve the problems of developing nations? Is Marxism an evil ideology, leading millions into totalitarian slavery? These were some of the questions in the back of my mind as I left for Kenya.""

""I realize that Kenya and America are very different, but experiences like this warned me that my own favorite beliefs in the miracles of free enterprise and the boundless opportunity to be had in America might be largely untrue.""

Coons' article concluded: ""I have spent my senior year re-examining my ideas and have returned to loving America, but in the way of one who has realized its faults and failures and still believes in its promise. The greatest value of Amherst for me, then, has been the role it played in allowing me to question, and to think. I had to see the slums of Nairobi before the slums of New York meant anything at all, but without the experiences of Amherst, I never would have seen either.""

Nowhere in the article does Coons cop to being a Marxist. You can read it in its entirety here.

Nor does his resume suggest Marxism. Coons worked as in-house counsel for his stepfather's fabrics company, W.L Gore & Associates, for eight years. In 2000, he was elected New Castle County Council president; and in 2004 was elected New Castle County executive.

So what other evidence to back up O'Donnell's claim that Coons is a Marxist? We didn't hear back from the O'Donnell campaign, but during the debate, O'Donnell said we need look no further than some of Coons' positions, ""like raising taxes, which is one of the tenets of Marxism; not supporting eliminating death tax, which is a tenet of Marxism."" We wrote yesterday about Coons proposing to raise property taxes by about 50 percent while acting as the New Castle County Executive. But does raising taxes make you a Marxist? By that measure, were Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush Marxists? O'Donnell has called for the elimination of estate taxes, and Coons has not. But again, does that make him a Marxist? Hardly. What the Communist Manifesto called for was abolishing the right of inheritance, not allowing inheritance and taxing it.

Conservatives increasingly have been using labels like socialist and Marxist to attack Democrats. With Coons, the case is irresponsibly thin. Praising a Marxist professor from college as ""bright and eloquent"" does not make one a Marxist. And any clear-eyed reading of Coons' ""The Making of a Bearded Marxist"" article would make it obvious the ""bearded Marxist"" line was a joke playing off the jabs of some of Coons' conservative buddies at college. O'Donnell's claim is ridiculously false, so we rate it Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/oct/14/christine-odonnell/christine-odonnell-claims-chris-coons-has-marxist-/

In debate, Chris Coons says Christine O'Donnell is wrong on county unemployment rate
","
In the Sept. 13, 2010, Delaware Senate debate between Democrat Chris Coons and Republican Christine O'Donnell, the candidates split in he-said, she-said fashion over an unemployment statistic.

O'Donnell kicked it off by charging that ""unemployment here in New Castle County rose, almost doubled in the last two years under (Coons') watch as New Castle County executive.""

A moment later, Coons countered, ""I also frankly can't imagine where she found the numbers that unemployment doubled in just the past year under my watch. I suspect we're going to need to keep a close eye this evening on the numbers that go flying back and forth."" 
One of the moderators, CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, interjected, ""Let's ask her. Where did you get those numbers?"" 
O'Donnell responded, ""The Department of Labor statistics. And we'll have them on our web site by tomorrow."" 
Sounds like a dispute tailor-made for PolitiFact: How much did unemployment rise in New Castle County, the most populous of Delaware's three counties?

Lets first clarify a few matters. In Coons' reply, he misstated the time frame O'Donnell had used, saying it was one year when in fact she had said she was looking at the past two years. We'll analyze the question using O'Donnell's criteria -- two years -- while noting that Coons garbled O'Donnell's time frame.

We also won't get into the question of whether a county executive deserves direct blame for rising unemployment, even though one can argue that unemployment is more sensitive to national and international economic factors than local ones.

For our answer, we turned to the Local Area Unemployment Statistics database at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a division of the U.S. Labor Department.

In the most recent available month, August 2010, New Castle County, Del., registered an 8.7 percent unemployment rate. Two years before, in August 2008, the rate was 5.5 percent. (The figures are not seasonally adjusted, but since we're comparing August of one year to August of another, making seasonal adjustments should be irrelevant in this comparison.)

That's a difference of 3.3 percentage points, or an increase of 58 percent over the August 2008 unemployment rate of 5.5 percent. If the rate had doubled as O'Donnell said, it would have needed to increase by 100 percent, which would have brought the unemployment rate to 11 percent today. And it clearly isn't that high.

O'Donnell did give herself some breathing room by saying that the rate ""almost"" doubled over the past two years. But while it's possible to argue that 58 percent should be rounded up to 100 percent (or ""double""), we think that's a stretch.

After we'd finished our research, we received a response from the O'Donnell campaign. A spokesman said that O'Donnell was actually referring to the rise in unemployment starting at the beginning of Coons' tenure as county executive. We confirmed with the New Castle County government that Coons, who was elected in November 2004, was inaugurated in January 2005.

So we looked at the county unemployment rate for January 2005 and found that it was 4.7 percent. That did rate roughly double by August 2010 -- but that's a period of five and a half years, not two, as O'Donnell had said in the debate. Using that time frame also measures unemployment from a point well before the economy slid into recession to a point of stubbornly high unemployment rates everywhere, so it would hardly be surprising to find the numbers rise.

As it happened, New Castle County performed better than the nation as a whole at each of these three points in time. The county's 4.7 percent unemployment rate in January 2005 was lower than the national 5.3 percent rate that month. The 5.5 percent unemployment rate in August 2008 was lower than the national rate of 6.2 percent that month, and the county's 8.7 percent in August 2010 was lower than the national rate of 9.6 percent. In fact, unemployment grew slightly more slowly in New Castle County over that period than it did nationally.

So where does this leave us? While O'Donnell is correct that unemployment has risen in New Castle County, as it has everywhere, the increase wasn't almost double over two years -- the period she said during the debate. By saying that she meant to measure it from the beginning of Coons' term as county executive, her campaign team is essentially conceding that she got the fact wrong. In our role as debate referee, we give Coons' stance that O'Donnell erred a rating of True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/14/chris-coons/debate-chris-coons-says-christine-odonnell-wrong-c/

Loranne Ausley's tax record center stage in state CFO race
","
In her TV ad, Democratic chief financial officer candidate Loranne Ausley threw a series of three claims against her Republican opponent Jeff Atwater. We said False.

Now Atwater is firing back with a trio of claims against Ausley in an ad of his own.

The ad is called ""Two Liberals,"" and liberally tries to tie Ausley to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Yes, they are both Democrats and women.

""This Washington liberal is raising taxes and wrecking our economy. Now, Pelosi has Loranne Ausley, the Tallahassee politician who wants total control ... of our money,"" a narrator says. ""Watch out, because Ausley's a financial train wreck for taxpayers -- pushing gas taxes, property taxes, taxes on seniors.

""Pelosi and Ausley -- too liberal too costly.""

Like Ausley's ad attacking Atwater, we're fact-checking the whole of the three specific claims -- that Ausley, a former member of the Florida House, pushed gas taxes, property taxes and taxes as seniors.

Our analysis reveals a political art -- clever wording.

Gas taxes

Ausley didn't push for increased gas taxes as a member of the state House. Instead, she voted against a one-month, eight-cent reduction of the gas tax back in 2004.

Here are the details. The bill, HB 237, reduced the state gas tax from 14.3 cents to 6.3 cents in August 2004, and also created a back-to-school sales tax holiday for school items $50 or less. The proposal passed with broad bipartisan support: 107-8 in the House and 34-4 in the Senate. Ausley was one of the eight no votes in the House. Atwater, a member of the state Senate, voted yes.

But that didn't mean the measure was completely popular. Newspaper editorials argued the loss in state revenue for temporarily lowering the gas tax -- about $60 million -- wasn't worth the small savings to drivers. The Sarasota Herald-Tribune editorial board calculated that the average driver would save a ""whopping"" $3.67. ""Don't spend it all in one place,"" they wrote.

""Loranne voted to keep the existing tax structure in place, as well as against the entire budget that year because of the lack of funding for important issues like boosting teacher salaries and the critical funding of Florida KidCare,"" Ausley spokesman Kevin Cate said.

It's worth noting that the idea of a gas tax holiday resurfaced in 2008 and was being pushed by Gov. Charlie Crist. Crist asked state Sen. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey, to file an amendment to a revenue bill (SB 1838) that would suspend 10 cents of the state's gas tax for a two-week period from July 1-14. But the amendment was never heard in the GOP-controlled Senate and Atwater, as a senator, didn't have to take a vote on the measure. Neither did Ausley, who was in the House.

Property taxes

Ausley didn't push for increased property taxes as a member of the state House. Instead, she voted against Republican proposals to cut property taxes.

Here are the details. During a special session in June 2007, Ausley voted against sending a proposed constitutional amendment to the ballot asking voters to replace Save Our Homes assessment caps with bigger homestead exemptions. Under the proposal, which passed without a Democratic vote, the first $200,000 of value would get a 75 percent exemption, then property values between $300,000 and $500,000 would get an additional 15 percent exemption. Homes valued at $500,000 and up would get a maximum exemption of $195,000.

Democrats argued that the tax cuts could harm funding for education and for police and fire protection. Ausley did vote to schedule the special election for the proposal on Jan. 29, 2008. She also voted for a proposal to roll back the tax bases for cities, counties and special taxing districts.

Ultimately, the Republican-led constitutional proposal was tossed off the ballot by a judge who ruled the amendment was confusing.

So legislators returned to deal with the constitutional proposal that October. Ausley was just one of two House members to vote against a House plan to raise the homestead exemption, create a cap on assessment increases for non-homesteaded property, provide additional exemptions for low-income seniors, and allow people to move and keep some of their homestead tax cap. According to the Tallahassee Democrat, Ausley complained that the ""cuts would devastate poor and rural counties.""

That proposal never became law or was put to voters either. Instead, the final tax reform product in 2007 -- what became known as Amendment 1 on January 2008 ballots -- passed the House 97-18 and the Senate 35-4. Ausley again voted against the measure.

Amendment 1 passed with 64 percent of the vote.

Taxes on seniors

Ausley didn't push for increased taxes on seniors. Instead, she opposed cutting and eliminating the state's intangible tax.

This is ground PolitiFact Florida already has covered in a claim against Ausley from the Republican Party of Florida. Here are the details. The intangible tax, which was repealed by the Legislature in 2006, was a state tax paid on the value of investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, money market funds and unsecured notes. Savings accounts, pension funds, certificates of deposit and 401(k)s were not subject to the tax. The tax was paid mostly by middle- and upper-income Floridians who had those types of investments.

On several occasions, Ausley voted against repealing, or making cuts to the intangible tax. In 2001, she did vote for a more modest cut than Republicans were proposing.

Democrats argued that the benefit of the cut was largely to the wealthy and the loss of state revenue would hurt programs for the poor.

The tax, of course, didn't apply only to seniors. It applied to anyone who had those types of investments. And it didn't apply to things that would be traditionally considered retirement funds like a 401(k) or a pension.

Summary 
This fact check centers on Atwater's claim that ""Ausley's a financial train wreck for taxpayers -- pushing gas taxes, property taxes, taxes on seniors."" First, we want to mention that Atwater's ad also claims that Ausley ""wants total control of our money."" That's incendiary and far-reaching rhetoric that cannot be supported by examining Ausley's statements or voting history. You should ignore the line. 
What is true, though, is that Ausley voted against measures to create a gas tax holiday for one month in 2004, voted against sweeping property tax cuts in 2007 and voted against eliminating a state tax on investments. That makes the ""taxes on seniors"" immediately deceptive because the intangible tax isn't a tax on seniors specifically.

Something else that has us scratching our heads more, though. Atwater says Ausley was ""pushing"" these taxes. But was she?

Time to take out the dictionary. There are several definitions of the word push, but in this context we find a couple that make sense - ""To cause to increase,"" and ""To press forward energetically against opposition."" Ausley didn't vote to cause those taxes to increase, nor did she press forward energetically with the taxes. She voted against cutting them. 
We find this claim False.",/factchecks/2010/oct/14/jeff-atwater/loranne-ausleys-tax-record-center-stage-state-cfo-/

Joe Manchin attacks John Raese for wife registered to vote in Florida
","
In what's becoming a familiar story, a longtime public official is facing a significant threat from an upstart challenger. In this case, the race is for the U.S. Senate seat for West Virginia formerly held by the late Robert Byrd, a Democrat. Gov. Joe Manchin, also a Democrat, was considered the favorite, but John Raese, a Republican businessman, has been showing strength in the polls.

So Manchin recently released a harsh attack ad against Raese. Here's how it goes:

""John Raese thinks we're hicks. His people hired actors from Philadelphia to attack Joe Manchin and told them to dress 'hicky.' It's insulting and he didn't even apologize. Then there's the fact Raese moved his family to Florida to avoid paying West Virginia taxes. Obviously, we're not good enough for him. Raese's wife is registered to vote in Florida so she can't even vote for him. Why should we?""

There's a lot to unpack there. Let's start with the ""hicky"" charge before moving onto our fact-check.

The ""hicky"" incident arose from an attack ad against Manchin that the National Republican Senatorial Committee put together. The ad shows three men in a diner talking about how they don't want to vote for Manchin because he would support President Barack Obama. The men are wearing flannel shirts and trucker hats, but other than that, it seems like a straightforward ""man on the street"" type of ad.

The controversy came when Politico reported on the advertisement looking for actors in Philadelphia to portray the men at the diner.

""We are going for a 'Hicky' Blue Collar look,"" read the casting call for the ad. ""These characters are from West Virginia so think coal miner/trucker looks.""

""Clothing Suggestions"" included jeans, work boots, flannel shirt, denim shirt, ""Dickie's type jacket with t-shirt underneath,"" down-filled vest, ""John Deer [sic] hats (not brand new, preferably beat up),"" ""trucker hats (not brand new, preferably beat up),"" according to Politico. Several days after those descriptions came to light, the NRSC fired the firm that was responsible.

We weren't as interested in the 'hicky' controversy as we were in the claims about Raese's Florida connections. We asked the Raese campaign for a response, but we didn't hear back. So we started by checking the voter registration rolls in Florida, which are public records.

We quickly determined that Raese's wife, Elizabeth Raese, is registered to vote in Palm Beach County. She has been registered since 2001 and last voted in the 2008 election, according to the Palm Beach County Supervisor of elections.

We also cross-checked her address with the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser. Property records indicate Elizabeth and John Raese own a 6,934 square foot home purchased in 1999 and with a market value of $2.67 million. The 2010 record also shows that the Raese's receive a homestead exemption, which indicates that the home is an owner's primary residence.

We spoke with officials at the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser's office. They confirmed that the Raese's did qualify for the exemption for the 2010 tax year, and that Elizabeth Raese is registered to vote in Florida and holds a Florida driver's license. John Raese is listed as ""owner non-resident"" in the appraiser's records. The officials confirmed that it's possible for a married couple to jointly own property and claim an exemption when only one spouse is the Florida homeowner.

It might seem strange to have a spouse who is an official resident of a state different from your own, but the Raese's wealth may account for the arrangement. Raese's campaign biography states, ""Despite a long list of business accomplishments throughout a lifetime, John is most proud of his family – wife Liz and two wonderful daughters Jane and Agnes. Liz is the founder of the Conservative Women of West Virginia, a growing group of activists charting a conservative path for the Mountain State."" (Press reports indicate his children attend a private Christian school in Florida.)

The ad further states that ""Raese moved his family to Florida to avoid paying West Virginia taxes."" Florida does not have a personal income tax and West Virginia does, but this claim is impossible for us to check: Tax information is confidential unless a candidate chooses to release it. Raese hasn't done that.

But a campaign spokesman told the Charleston Gazette that Raese does pay taxes in West Virginia. ""John Raese is a West Virginia resident. Period. He pays income and property taxes there, and any attempts to claim otherwise are acts of desperation by a hopelessly listing campaign,"" said spokesman Kevin McLaughlin.

The Gazette also reported that Raese owns a home in Morgantown, W. Va., listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and that he is registered to vote in Monongalia County.

Raese has run for office before and had his residency questioned by opponents. But Raese's campaign biography and independent press reports indicate that he is a longtime West Virginia resident. He serves as president and CEO of Greer Industries, a steel and limestone company founded by his grandparents and headquartered in Morgantown, W. Va.

Manchin's ad tries to make voters question Raese's loyalty to West Virginia. It's hard to make a case that Raese isn't someone with longtime ties to West Virginia. On the other hand, it's true that his wife is registered to vote in Florida, and that's the fact we're checking here. Public records confirm she is registered to vote in Florida and receives a homestead exemption on her property. So we rate Manchin's statement True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/14/joe-manchin/joe-manchin-attacks-john-raese-wife-registered-vot/

GOP challenger Josh Mandel says Treasurer Kevin Boyce made a state job known only at a mosque
","
In perhaps the most controversial political ad of this election season in Ohio, Republican treasurer candidate Josh Mandel mixes religious terms into an attack on opponent Kevin Boyce’s integrity.

A Mandel television commercial, which began airing Sept. 30, revolves around ties between incumbent Democrat Boyce and a lobbyist for a bank that was awarded three banking contracts this year. The lobbyist, Noure Alo, is a friend of Boyce’s top deputy. Alo’s wife was hired in Boyce’s office before the banking contracts were awarded through a competitive bidding process.

Political advertisements commonly question relationships between politicians and lobbyists. But the religious references in Mandel’s attack have led some to label the ad bigoted.

The ad scans over newspaper headlines about Boyce and the lobbyist, then describes a job the lobbyist’s wife received. It ends with an image of Mandel, a Marine Corps veteran who served two tours in Iraq, dressed in military fatigues.

""Boyce gave (a lobbyist’s) wife a sensitive job in the treasurer’s office, a job Boyce admitted he only made available at their mosque,"" the commercial’s narrator says.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look at that claim, given the ad’s controversial nature.

Critics of the commercial say it insinuates Boyce, at the least, is cozy with Muslims. Others have suggested the ad actually portrays Boyce, a Christian, as a Muslim. Either association is meant to strike a chord with voters who hold anti-Muslim biases, Mandel’s critics have said. Mandel’s campaign said Oct. 8 it would stop airing the commercial. But Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern said the damage was done. ""This will be an ad that will haunt Josh Mandel's political career,"" he said.

In the days following its release, Boyce produced two television commercials in response to Mandel’s ad, his campaign sent Mandel a cease and desist letter urging him to stop airing the commercial and the Ohio Democratic Party complained to the Ohio Elections Commission, alleging Mandel broke elections rules by airing a commercial with false attacks.

At the core of these grievances is a connection made between Boyce and a mosque.

The Plain Dealer reported in June that Boyce’s deputy, Amer Ahmad, a friend of the lobbyist, announced the job opening at his mosque after an executive assistant suddenly resigned in December 2009. The lobbyist’s wife, Walaa Waeda, applied and was hired later that month. ""I announced it at the mosque, she applied and we quickly hired her,"" Ahmad said in an interview for the June story.

But Mandel’s commercial doesn’t say Ahmad announced the job a mosque; it says Boyce himself made the job available there. We asked Mandel’s campaign to explain why the commercial claimed it was Boyce – not Ahmad – who made the job announcement at ""their mosque,"" a phrase that implies Boyce belongs to the mosque.

Mandel’s political director, Joe Aquilino, said Boyce’s name was used in the commercial because Ahmad was representing the state treasury when he announced the job opening. Boyce, as state treasurer, has the final say on who gets hired. ""Treasurer Boyce must be held accountable for the personnel decisions in his office,"" Aquilino said.

Boyce has never been to the Columbus-area mosque referenced in the commercial, his campaign manager Bryan Clark said. He is a steward at his church, the St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal Church in Columbus.

Additionally, Ahmad, Boyce’s deputy, now denies he announced the job opening at a mosque. ""Neither I, nor Treasurer Boyce, ever announced, advertised or discussed any secretarial job at the Treasurer’s Office at the mosque referenced in the Mandel television ad,"" Ahmad said in an Oct. 5 affidavit included in the Ohio Democratic Party’s complaint to the Elections Commission. When asked to explain his affidavit, Ahmad referred questions to a Treasury spokeswoman. The spokeswoman said she could not discuss the affidavit.

It is not the only time Ahmad changed his story regarding the hiring of the lobbyist’s wife. In his affidavit, Ahmad said the lobbyist’s wife originally submitted her resume to the Treasury in summer 2009, along with hundreds of others, in response to an online job posting by the Ohio Department of Administrative Services. But the lobbyist’s wife’s resume was not included in her personnel file when The Plain Dealer obtained it earlier this year. On her job application, dated Dec. 21, 2009, Waeda checked ""monster.com"" and ""other"" when asked how she learned of the job. Further, neither Ahmad nor Boyce mentioned the job posting in separate interviews about the hiring before the Oct. 5 affidavit was filed. Ahmad originally said she was hired to replace another receptionist who resigned in December 2009. When Boyce was asked if she turned in her resume before the December resignation, he said he didn’t know.

Despite these inconsistencies from Boyce’s office, it is clear Boyce himself never announced the executive assistant’s job at a mosque. His campaign objected to another claim in the commercial -- that Waeda, the lobbyist’s wife was given a ""sensitive"" job at the Treasury. The job includes traditional secretarial work and does not allow access to confidential documents, according to Ahmad’s affidavit.

Aquilino, Mandel’s political director disagreed. An executive assistant, at the least, could observe which lobbyists and bank representatives were visiting the office. ""There’s little doubt items of interest to her lobbyist husband would land on her desk,"" Aquilino said. Without direct access to the Treasurer’s office on a day-to-day basis, Aquilino’s portrayal carries little weight. Ahmad is in a better position to characterize Waeda’s job responsibilities.

The description of the lobbyist’s wife’s job is consistent with the goal of Mandel’s ad: to raise questions among voters about Boyce’s character by displaying a relationship between Boyce and a lobbyist. There is no denying Boyce hired the lobbyist’s wife, but Mandel stretched the truth when he tied Boyce to the job announcement at a mosque. Boyce was never there.

The general principle of Mandel’s explanation – that Boyce should be held accountable for his deputy’s actions – is an acceptable standard against which to judge elected officials. But the ad plays loose with the facts to identify Boyce with a religion he doesn’t practice.

We find the statement False.

David Rivera wrong about Joe Garcia's vote on utility rates
","
In a 33-second video called ""One of Them,"" Republican state Rep. David Rivera launches several attacks against his South Florida Congressional district rival Joe Garcia. The claims accuse Garcia of defending Nancy Pelosi's ""reckless spending and debt"" and of being a ""Washington insider.""

In the ad, average Joe-like actors take turns weighing in on Garcia's alleged political shortcomings and transgressions: A narrator spells out the gloom and doom as Average Joes -- you know, taxpayers -- pipe in.

""Washington insider Joe Garcia doesn't get it. 
He defends Pelosi's reckless spending and debt. 
'Our children will pay the price.'(Average Jane) 
Joe allowed tax dollars to be used to send our jobs overseas. 
'That's outrageous.' (Average Joe). 
Joe Garcia raised utility rates on families. 
'He lied to us.' (Average Joe) 
And Joe Garcia takes money from Washington's culture of corruption. 
'He's one of them.' (Average Jane) 
'Haven't we been through enough?' (Average Jane, as Average Joe beside her shakes his head.)

We were curious about Rivera's claims, and decided to focus on the one that, gasp, targets not just Florida taxpayers but Florida families! ""Joe Garcia raised utility rates on families.""

As evidence of Garcia's alleged utility-rate hike, the Rivera campaign points to a matter that came before the Florida Public Service Commission in February 1997. Garcia served on the commission from August 1994 to June 2000.

The background: Florida Power Corp. at the time served 1.3 million customers in 32 counties in north, west and central Florida. The power company had the highest rates among the state's four largest utilities then, and it had been placed on the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's ""watch list,"" which included 14 of the country's most troubled facilities. It was also under investigation by the Public Service Commission. Among Florida Power's facilities was the Crystal River nuclear plant, and that plant had shut down in September 1996. By February 1997 it was still not producing power, and it wasn't expected to resume production until later that year.

What Rivera claims is that on Feb. 18, 1997, Garcia approved a rate hike for Florida Power that amounted to $88 million. The rate hike was to allow the company to recover costs associated with the long shutdown of the Crystal River plant. As evidence, the campaign cited a PSC ""vote sheet"" signed by Garcia and stamped ""approved.""

Wading through PSC records in current cases isn't easy, and a case more than 13 years old can be a bureaucratic labyrinth. What we found is that Rivera's justification for the claim mixes up two meetings, leading to a faulty conclusion.

Here's what happened:

On Feb. 18, 1997, the PSC voted on an accounting issue that was discussed at a hearing in 1996. Garcia was there and voted in favor of the staff recommendation. That's why his name is on the vote sheet. But that vote didn't involve a rate hike.

The next day, Feb. 19, the PSC met again -- but the transcript of that meeting shows Garcia was not there. The commission voted again, but technically the vote was to approve a fuel charge for Florida Power, not on a rate hike.

When utilities spend more on fuel than they had budgeted to provide power, they can petition to pass that extra fuel cost on to their customers. With Crystal River shut down, Florida Power had additional costs it wanted to pass on, and the PSC approved asking customers to pay the difference. That charge was described in the St. Petersburg Times as $88 million.

Again: Two different meetings, two different votes, two different issues.

We went back to the Rivera campaign. Spokeswoman Leslie Veiga again cited Garcia's vote on Feb. 18, 1997 -- a vote that, we know now, had nothing to do with raising utility rates. The Rivera campaign's insistence in sticking to the ad is surprising, because painting Garcia as a rate hiker is contrary to his image.

For example, a Miami Herald editorial on Aug. 23, 2000, after Garcia had left the PSC, described him as ""committed to consumer protection, yet admirably even-handed."" Another on June 10, 2000, called him ""the consumer-friendly head of the PSC.""

In his time as PSC chairman, Garcia supported bringing ""merchant plants"" into Florida, plants that were not regulated by the state but allowed to sell their power wholesale to other utilities. The state's utilities opposed the move.

The St. Petersburg Times said on April 21, 2000: ""Garcia had lobbied heavily in favor of merchant plants, much to the dismay of the utilities he regulates. He argued that merchant plants would bring more robust competition to the wholesale market, which in turn would lower electricity prices for consumers and businesses. Moreover, the investment in such plants was being borne by the companies, not ratepayers.""

In fact, Garcia's efforts were so strenuous that on April 5, 2000, Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Palm Harbor, stormed out of a hearing to blast Garcia for siding with the merchant plants, The Palm Beach Post reported. The move ultimately was rejected by a Florida Supreme Court decision that the PSC lacked the legislative authority to approve the plants.

To wrap it up, then, the Rivera claim is wildly off the mark -- on two counts. First, the evidence Rivera offers that Garcia ""raised utility rates"" is for a different vote on an accounting issue. Second, the next-day vote (the one Garcia missed) to pass on fuel cost to customers wasn't a rate hike -- though we acknowledge that to customers, it surely felt like one since the monthly bill went up. The ad is plainly not accurate given Garcia's consumer-friendly stands. In fact, it reminds us of the statement made by Average Joe in the Rivera ad (""he lied to us""). So we rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2010/oct/14/david-rivera/david-rivera-wrong-Joe-Garcia-utility-rates/

The NRCC works to get Republicans elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. One Democrat it wants to take down in the 2010 campaign is two-term Rep. Steve Kagen of Appleton. He faces Republican challenger Reid Ribble on Nov. 2.

In a TV ad, the NRCC aims to turn Kagen’s vote for the stimulus, and two other measures, against him.

""Kagen promised us jobs, voting for the $787 billion stimulus,"" the announcer says, referring to Wisconsin. ""Cost: another 77,000 jobs lost.""

When this is mentioned, a goofy image of Kagen giving two thumbs up pops up behind the Capitol building.

Similar images -- including one pairing Kagen with U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- are used to underscore the message that Kagen’s votes ""cost Wisconsin dearly."" The other votes cited are on the cap-and-trade bill and a vote to raise the debt limit.

We homed in on the stimulus claim because it seems so counter-intuitive.   

To be sure, critics say the cost of the stimulus has bought too few jobs, and point out that unemployment has only grown worse. U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, a leading conservative on budget matters, has said borrowing done as part of the stimulus will lead to ""job-killing tax hikes"" one day.

But the NRCC is claiming Wisconsin has already lost 77,000 jobs because of the stimulus.

""When I saw that ad,"" said Kevin Quinn, an economics professor at St. Norbert College in De Pere, ""my response was that it was patently ridiculous.""

Hold on, professor. Let’s look and see.

The ad starts by stringing together some correct information.  

Kagen supported the $787 billion stimulus (although that estimate has since been boosted to $814 billion by the Congressional Budget Office). And Wisconsin has had a net loss of more than 77,000 jobs since the measure became law in February 2009, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

When asked for facts to back up the stimulus claim in the ad, Tom Erickson, Midwest press secretary for the NRCC, provided the citation on the job-loss figures. But when we called and e-mailed asking for evidence that the lost jobs were a result of the stimulus, he did not reply.

Perhaps with good reason.

In logic class, this one falls under the category that correlation does not prove causation. Think of it this way: Incidents of drowning may go up at the beach at the same time ice cream sales rise. That doesn’t mean ice cream causes you to drown. It may just mean more people are at the beach.

Indeed, the consensus -- from several government and private-sector reports issued in 2010 -- is the stimulus has boosted employment. Directly and indirectly, the analysts conclude, the stimulus has created or saved more than 1 million, as many as 2.7 million, or even as many as 4.8 million jobs nationwide.

In Wisconsin, the federal government counted 16,348 jobs directly funded by the stimulus in the most recent quarter (April through June 2010) reviewed. In total, according to the state, the stimulus has created or retained 63,000 jobs in Wisconsin.

Let’s return to Quinn, the outraged economics professor. He said he is not supporting either candidate in the Kagen-Ribble race.

It’s fair to question how efficient the stimulus has been, Quinn said, but there is no debate it has created jobs, both directly and indirectly. And even though joblessness in Wisconsin has risen, it would have been worse without the stimulus injection, he said.

Quinn said the only way he could conceive of arguing that the stimulus killed jobs is if it increased taxes. But it didn’t. As our colleagues at PolitiFact National have reported, of the original $787 billion, $499 billion was to fund new roads, hire teachers and generally keep people employed, and about $288 billion -- or 36 percent -- was in tax breaks.

So is Quinn alone in his views? No.

""A broad spectrum of economists would say that the stimulus cannot have cost jobs,"" said Laura Dresser, associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy (yes, COWS) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""The recovery spending increased demand in the economy, and that creates jobs directly, or indirectly, or saves jobs.""

Some jobs are created or saved because they are funded directly by stimulus money, Dresser explained. And others are created and saved indirectly, she said -- partly as a result of spending done by people holding stimulus-funded jobs who would otherwise be unemployed.

We won’t add on any more economists.

In issuing its attack against Democratic U.S. Rep. Steve Kagen, the National Republican Congressional Committee said the federal stimulus bill cost Wisconsin 77,000 jobs. The two things may have happened in the same time frame, but that does not mean one caused the other. Indeed, there is plenty of evidence the stimulus has created jobs.

Here’s a more direct formula: Twisted logic + lack of evidence = Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/oct/14/national-republican-congressional-committee/republicans-say-stimulus-bill-supported-us-rep-ste/
"['Ethics', 'Texas', 'Bill White']","
Bill White says Gov. Rick Perry said he couldn't attend a gubernatorial forum because of scheduling conflicts, but then tweeted that he ran around the lake the day of the event
","
Hoping to engage youth in the political process, students at El Paso's Coronado High School hosted a forum featuring Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White. 
During the event, which we watched online, White hardly mentioned GOP Gov. Rick Perry, who had declined to participate. Later, however, White questioned Perry's absence. ""The students in El Paso high schools had taken the initiative to ask the gubernatorial candidates to talk about voting, civic responsibilities and their visions for Texas,"" White was quoted saying in an Oct. 5 San Antonio-Express News article. ""He told them he had a scheduling conflict and couldn't show up, and while I was answering questions from the students, he tweeted that he'd just been running with his dog around Town Lake,"" meaning Austin's Lady Bird Lake. 
Oops. Did Perry out himself playing political hooky? 
At 12:47 p.m. Sept. 24 — around the time of the El Paso forum, which was scheduled for 11:30 Austin time — Perry tweeted: ""Rare AM off to run town lake with Rory....what a great asset the running trails are to Austin."" He linked to a photo of a black dog swimming with a stick in its mouth on the south side of the lake. 
At 2:06 p.m., White tweeted: ""Just at student forum; Perry declined for 'scheduling conflict'"" and quoted Perry's tweet: ""Rare AM off to run town lake..."" 
Asked for an explanation, Catherine Frazier, a Perry spokeswoman, told us that ""all of our responses to debate invites have clarified that we would not consider any debates until Bill White released his tax returns for his years of public service."" Perry has said he won't debate White until the Democrat makes public his income tax returns for the two years he was deputy U.S. energy secretary and from when he later chaired the Texas Democratic Party. White has released his tax returns for the six years he served as Houston's mayor. 
A story posted the day before the El Paso forum on the website of El Paso's ABC affiliate, KVIA, jibes with the Perry camp's explanation: ""Initially, organizers wanted to host a debate between White and incumbent governor Rick Perry. But Perry declined all debate invitations because White has refused to release his tax returns from his time as deputy energy secretary in the mid-1990s."" 
But Katy Bacon, a White spokeswoman, forwarded us two e-mails that she said her boss's campaign received from the students organizing the event. The e-mails suggest the students didn't receive the same pat answer from Perry. 
In an Aug. 12 e-mail, the students told the White camp that ""the campaign for Governor Perry has recently said they are re-evaluating our event. Therefore, while the evaluation process continues, we will be sending the Governor's campaign similar information regarding the proposed agenda for the forum in the event that Governor Perry does attend our event."" 
In an Aug. 18 e-mail, the students confirmed that the forum would take place Sept. 24. They also wrote that ""we have recently received word that Governor Perry cannot make the event due to scheduling conflicts, however, we are very excited to continue on with the forum with Mayor White's participation ... Though Governor Perry will not participate, (the) event will remain a nonpartisan effort to educate students on the importance of becoming engaged voters."" 
Gary Berglund, a government and history teacher at the school, said he helped the students organize the event. Berglund told us that the governor's state office did not tell the students that Perry wouldn't attend because White was withholding tax returns. ""They couldn't do it due to scheduling conflicts,"" Berglund said. 
We asked if any of the exchanges with Perry's camp were in writing. Berglund said the students' discussions with the governor's office were by telephone only. 
A story posted Sept. 24 on KVIA.com quotes Jackie Wang, one of the students who helped organized the event, saying Perry ""had scheduling conflicts, and we understand that, we wanted to work around that but we couldn't."" 
Another organizer, Coronado senior Rachel Jackson, told us this week that she had communicated with the governor's office several times and that a Perry aide had said the governor could not attend because of scheduling conflicts. 
Jackson then forwarded us a voicemail she said she received Aug. 6 from Ryan Vise, who works in the governor's state scheduling office telling her that Perry wasn't able to make the first date — Sept. 9 — the students put forth. Our transcript: ""My name is Ryan Vise, I'm with the Gov. Perry's scheduling office. I'm calling regarding the invitation that was sent in for the debate with Bill White on Sept. 9. Unfortunately, due to scheduling conflicts, we are not going to be able to attend. We do apologize, but we just cannot make it."" 
Jackson told us that when the students followed up with a date that suited White — Sept. 24 — Perry's office again declined, citing scheduling conflicts. 
Jackson added: ""However, we were aware that in the press there was a battle going on with income taxes."" She speculated that the governor's office was ""working under the assumption that we knew about the income tax debacle."" 
Jackson stressed to us that the forum was a nonpartisan event to engage students in politics. ""The students don't want to be in the middle of 'he-said, she-said' political mudslinging,"" she said. ""We don't want our project to become a tool for some political campaigns."" 
Next, we went back to Frazier, who reiterated that the campaign has consistently said it would consider debate requests only after White released more tax returns. ""This debate request was one of the first we got over the summer, and Rob Johnson, our campaign manager, called the group telling them that considering debates was contingent on release of the tax returns,"" Frazier said. She told us that Perry doesn't distinguish between debates and forums because ""they're pretty much the same thing, a Q&A between the candidates."" 
Jackson told us that she did not communicate with Johnson. 
And the governor's state office? No state officials, including Vise, had responded before we finalized this story. 
All told, it's undisputed that Perry has often said he's not debating White until he releases more tax returns. However, it looks like there was another message delivered to the student organizers of the Coronado High forum; the saved voice mail — which no one in Perry's office questioned — is persuasive. 
It's also undisputed that Perry tweeted about his run around Lady Bird Lake (né Town Lake) the morning of the El Paso forum. That's also what White said. 
In the end, we're mindful that Perry has repeatedly said his unwillingness to debate is based on White not releasing more tax returns, whereas White's statement suggests that Perry would have joined the forum if only he hadn't ginned up the ""schedule conflict"" excuse. 
We rate White's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/14/bill-white/bill-white-says-gov-rick-perry-told-students-he-co/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Voting Record', 'Illinois', 'Mike Bost']","
In Illinois race for Congress, Mike Bost makes a head-scratching claim
","To hear U.S. Rep. Mike Bost tell it, his 2018 election challenger in Illinois has ""spent his career"" supporting Nancy Pelosi. Not only that, says Bost, a Republican, in a TV ad, but Democrat Brendan Kelly has spent that career also supporting Mike Madigan, the speaker of the Illinois House. This seemed puzzling. Kelly started his post-Navy career as a county employee. Since 2010 he has been state’s attorney — the top prosecutor — for St. Clair County, Ill., a county bordering St. Louis, Mo. Prosecutors don’t get votes in the state Legislature. They don’t vote in Congress. So how has Kelly ""spent his career"" supporting the top Democratic legislative leaders? We asked the Bost campaign, and the answer is still puzzling. The ad has two parts, first telling voters what Bost wants them to know about his opponent, then saying what he wants them to know about himself. Bost was in the Illinois House for 20 years until winning his congressional seat in 2014. Seated at a table and wearing an open-collar, button-down shirt, he says: ""Folks, they’re at it again. I’ve spent 20 years fighting Pelosi and Madigan; my opponent has spent his career supporting them."" He then says, ""I’ve never stopped fighting for our families. Whether it’s creating a stronger economy or bringing our steel jobs back or reforming the VA to ensure better care for our veterans, or fighting for fair trade and a level playing field, I’ve never wavered."" So how has Kelly, a prosecutor, spent his career supporting Pelosi and Madigan? Bost’s campaign sent PolitiFact several articles on Kelly’s fundraising. The articles pointed out that even though Kelly says he wants someone other than Pelosi to be the next U.S. House Democratic leader, he has benefitted from Pelosi’s fundraising. That was the very headline in a Real Clear Politics article in April: ""Non-Supporter of Pelosi Benefits From Her Fundraising."" An article in the St. Louis American in late April said that U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), came to East St. Louis to stump for Kelly. The DCCC tries to get Democrats elected to Congress, and Lujan was Pelosi’s pick for the chairmanship, making him part of her team. Pelosi, Lujan and a number of incumbent Illinois congressional Democrats, including Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, sponsored a Washington fundraiser on April 25 for four Illinois Democrats -- including Kelly -- hoping to join them in Congress if elected, according to another piece of backup material the Bost campaign sent us. Finally, there was an article on June 1 in the Illinois Review: ""Pelosi to raise funds for Democratic contenders."" From these and other articles, we know that Kelly wants someone else to head the Democratic caucus in the U.S. House. Pelosi wants him elected anyway and is raising money for him and other Democrats. This has been a theme in 2018 congressional coverage, with Republicans saying these Democrats are hypocrites. Kelly told Real Clear Politics for its story that he doesn’t support Pelosi as his party’s leader but that the Washington fundraising invitation came from the Illinois Democratic congressional delegation, not Pelosi. We asked the Bost campaign again: How does Pelosi’s fundraising help show that Kelly, a county officeholder, ""spent his career supporting"" Pelosi and Madigan? ""We might be arguing over semantics here,"" Bost campaign spokesman George O’Connor answered in an email. ""Brendan Kelly's liberal record and fundraising speaks for itself and shows that he's already in Pelosi's pocket."" Had Bost said as much in the ad, we might find ourselves examining that claim. But that is not what Bost said in an ad to voters in Illinois’ 12th Congressional District. Kelly’s campaign, of course, disagrees with Bost. Here is what Kelly campaign spokesman Sam Barrett said: ""Brendan has been the state's attorney in St. Clair County for the past eight years. Before that he was the county clerk and before that he was an assistant state's attorney. And before law school he served in the U.S. Navy. ""He has never voted for Nancy Pelosi, has vowed in multiple interviews that he won't and hasn't taken a dime from her campaign account nor her leadership account."" You can make a case that since Kelly is a Democrat, he supports the general ideals of top Democrats, be they in Washington or Springfield. But to single out Pelosi in particular, and even Madigan, and say Kelly has spent his career supporting them is a stretch. He has never had a vote on legislation, Democrat- or Republican-sponsored. Much of his career has involved prosecution, and occurred about 800 miles from where Pelosi presides over her party. Pelosi has raised money for Kelly, not vice versa. Even if her fundraising assistance was a sign of reciprocal support from Kelly — which is a reach — it occurred in 2018, a single year in Kelly’s significantly longer career. Turn up the flames.

"['West Virginia', 'Immigration', 'Joe Manchin']","
Did Joe Manchin vote to fund the border wall?
","Immigration policy has been one of the most contentious issues in Congress in recent years. And a big part of that debate has revolved around President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall. Generally, Democrats have been skeptical that a wall is needed or would work as an immigration-control measure. But Democratic senators who are up for election this year in Republican-leaning states have had to walk a political tightrope, balancing their party loyalty with their constituents’ support for the president. In an ad in his reelection campaign, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said, ""I wanted Mexico to pay for the wall, but they’re not. So we need to do it ourselves."" Despite attacks by Republicans accusing him of being soft on illegal immigration, Manchin said in the ad, ""I voted to fund President Trump’s wall. Check the vote."" So we did. The clearest example — and the one Manchin visually highlighted in his ad — was a bill sponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. Among other things, it would have funded a border wall. Specifically, the legislation said that ""the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take such actions as may be necessary (including the removal of obstacles to detection of illegal entrants) to construct, install, deploy, operate, and permanently maintain physical barriers, tactical infrastructure and technology in the vicinity of the United States border to achieve situational awareness and operational control of the border and deter, impede, and detect illegal activity in high traffic areas.'' The measure also would have struck the language in an existing bill that said ""fencing and road Improvements'' and instead inserted ""physical barriers"" -- a stronger phrase, closer to the vision of a ""wall."" ""Not later than September 30, 2022, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in carrying out this section, shall deploy along the United States border the most practical and effective physical barriers and tactical infrastructure available for achieving situational awareness and operational control of the border,"" the legislation said. The legislation included other elements of Trump’s immigration agenda, including tighter curbs on legal immigration, that made it unpalatable to most Democrats. Trump backed this measure, and three Democrats ended up voting for it when it came up on Feb. 15, 2018, along with 36 Republicans. That was well short of a majority and much less the 60 votes required to advance the measure to a final vote. But Manchin was one of those three Democrats to vote for it. In two other instances, Manchin voted for measures that would have increased border security infrastructure such as fencing, but not precisely the wall as envisioned by Trump. One was a bipartisan measure, informally called the Common Sense Plan, that would have implemented a path to citizenship for ""dreamers"" who were brought illegally to the United States as minors, along with funding for border security. Despite the border-security language, Trump opposed it. The measure would have provided $25 billion for ""the construction of physical barriers, border security technologies, and tactical infrastructure."" It said that within six months after passage, the executive branch would have to submit to Congress ""a risk-based plan for improving security along the borders of the United States, including the use of personnel, fencing, other forms of tactical infrastructure, and technology."" It won the backing of eight Republicans and 46 Democrats and Democratic-caucusing independents. Manchin voted to advance the measure to a final vote. However, it fell short of the 60 votes required for final passage. A third measure — and the only one to pass — was a $1.3 trillion annual federal government spending bill, of which funding for replacement border fencing was a small part. Trump has sometimes touted this bill as making progress on building his border wall, but we have found these claims inaccurate, because the law was actually explicit about providing funding for items outside the scope of the Trump wall. The bill included $1.6 billion for some projects at the border, but none of that can be used toward the border wall promised during the presidential campaign. The final vote for this bill was 65-32 in favor. All told, 39 Democrats voted for it, including Manchin. It can be tricky to pin down what pieces of legislation supported Trump’s specific vision for the wall, and which supported more generic elements of border security. However, the bill Manchin highlighted in his ad -- the Grassley legislation -- received Trump’s support, so Manchin’s vote for it was effectively a vote for Trump’s border-security vision, however it might play out on the ground. This supports Manchin’s notion that he ""voted to fund President Trump’s wall."" Manchin’s overall message is a shift from Trump’s first year in office. Morrisey’s office forwarded us a link to an article that listed a number of instances in which Manchin spoke out against, or expressed skepticism about, the idea of a border wall. For instance, the article noted that in an interview on ""The Young Turks"" on July 11, 2017, Manchin said, ""I’m not for building a wall. I’m not for building a wall at all."" He also told Politico that month that he had ""not been supportive of funding for a wall."" Manchin said, ""I voted to fund President Trump’s wall."" Manchin has offered various opinions about the merits of a border wall over time. However, when it came to votes, we found a clear instance in which Manchin supported a Trump-backed, hard-line immigration bill with border wall provisions that was too conservative even for a sizable portion of the Republican caucus. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/oct/05/joe-manchin/did-joe-manchin-vote-fund-border-wall/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Maine Democratic Party']","
Did Maine's Bruce Poliquin vote to strip 117,000 people of health insurance?
","Democrats are latching onto Republicans’ voting records on health care as a springboard to criticize their midterm opponents. The Maine Democratic Party picked up on that argument in a mailer on the U.S. House race in the state’s 2nd Congressional District between Republican incumbent Bruce Poliquin and Democratic challenger Jared Golden. The mailer claims that ""Bruce Poliquin’s dangerous votes to cut health care coverage harm Maine families."" It goes on to say that Poliquin ""voted to strip 117,000 Mainers of their coverage."" The attack is based on Poliquin’s votes to repeal President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act and replace it the with the Republican-backed American Health Care Act, which Poliquin voted for in May 2017. Let’s take a look at the estimates for Maine. When we checked with the Democrats, party spokesman Chris Glynn pointed to a Portland Press Herald story that references an analysis published in May 2017 by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. The center came up with a state-by-state estimate of coverage losses based on a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The latter report found that the American Health Care Act would increase the number of people who are uninsured by 23 million in 2026, compared to the ACA.   The center calculated that approximately 116,700 Mainers would see a net loss in insurance coverage under the plan by 2026. Here’s how that breaks down: 57,300 fewer Medicaid recipients, 11,900 fewer people with employer-based coverage, and 47,500 fewer people with insurance obtained through the individual marketplace. The combined total of 116,700 represents about 9 percent of the state’s population. The ad is based on findings of a liberal-leaning group, so we contacted other research organizations considered more moderate, such as the Urban Institute’s Health Policy Center. The institute produced its own study of the state-by-state implications of the AHCA. Its prediction of uninsured Mainers was half as much as the Center for American Progress. In the report, the Urban Institute estimated that by 2022, Maine would experience an increase in the uninsured by 56,000 people. Urban Institute fellow Linda Blumberg couldn’t say exactly how the center divided up the CBO data, but explained that her organization got its estimation from a simulation that showed 23 million more people uninsured under the AHCA by 2022. The estimated effects by state varied significantly in terms of numbers and percentages, Blumberg told PolitiFact. This is a function of the distribution of health insurance coverage in each state, distribution of income, and a variety of other factors related to the population and how it varies by geographic location. In general, she said, states that had gained the most coverage under the ACA were estimated to lose the most under the AHCA. Blumberg pointed out that while CAP’s estimation is higher, both organizations find that large percentage increases in the uninsured would have occurred under the AHCA in the state of Maine, had it passed. The Kaiser Family Foundation, also estimated that premiums would have likely gone up in large swaths of Maine (particularly in Poliquin’s district, which encompasses the entire portion of the state north of Portland and Augusta) under the AHCA, thus pricing many Mainers out of insurance. The mailer makes a blanket statement saying that Poliquin’s vote was to ""strip"" 117,000 Mainers of health coverage. It would be more accurate to say that, according to the Center for American Progress, 117,000 people could either lose their coverage, see a rise in premiums and be priced out, or be forced into an exclusion — which would limit coverage for a particular condition, but not coverage for those people entirely. Another critical part of the coverage losses in Maine would likely lie in the Medicaid cutbacks of the AHCA, which was estimated to be cut by $880 million over a 10-year span. According to the Portland Press Herald, about 75 percent of Medicaid recipients under the state’s ""MaineCare"" program are children, low-income senior citizens who qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare, and the disabled. The Maine Democratic Party said Poliquin voted to strip 117,000 Mainers of their insurance. The group refers to his votes to repeal Obamacare and replace it with the Republican-backed American Health Care Act. The 117,000 figure comes from an analysis by the liberal Center for American Progress. It is the highest of estimates we’ve found. The ad’s language would lead the reader to believe that Poliquin literally voted to strip 117,000 Mainers of coverage, and that all would lose their coverage automatically. This is misleading. The statement is partially accurate and needs additional context, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2018/oct/05/maine-democratic-party/did-bruce-poliquin-vote-strip-117000-people-health/
"['Texas', 'Marijuana', ""Beto O'Rourke""]","
Beto O'Rourke says marijuana is legal in most states
","During a stump speech at country music superstar Willie Nelson’s September 29, 2018, rally in Austin, for U.S. Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke, the El Paso congressman told a crowd of more than 50,000 supporters that marijuana use is legal in most states. O’Rourke set up the claim at the ""Turn out for Texas"" rally by describing the nation's ""war on drugs"" as a ""war on people, and some people more than other people."" He was talking about people of color, he explained.

""Only some are getting arrested,"" said O’Rourke, the Democrat challenging Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. ""Only some are doing time. Only some are checking a box on an application form that makes it that less likely that they'll get that job. Only some will not qualify for Pell Grants for possession of a substance that is legal in most states in this country."" The way O’Rourke summed up marijuana laws, which vary by state, territory and depth, made our ears perk, so we asked his campaign about the claim. Chris Evans, communications director for O’Rourke’s campaign, shared with PolitiFact Texas in an email Business Insider and ABC News reports to support the congressman’s claim, but their evidence doesn’t show that marijuana use is legal across-the-board in most states. ""As of today, marijuana is illegal in only 20 states,"" Evans said in the email. ""That's less than half of the states. Beto has called for ending the federal prohibition on marijuana and co-sponsored bipartisan legislation to achieve this."" The articles explain that using marijuana recreationally is legal in nine states, while medical marijuana is legal in 30. Oklahoma in June became the 30th and latest state to authorize medical marijuana. In a deep dive on marijuana legislation across the country, the National Conference of State Legislatures reaches the same count. Voters in North Dakota and Michigan this November will have the choice to approve adult use of marijuana, while voters in Utah and Missouri will decide whether to authorize medical marijuana, according to Forbes. We also posed questions to Mason Tvert, spokesman with the Marijuana Policy Project, a Washington D.C.-based organization whose mission includes increasing ""public support for non-punitive, non-coercive marijuana policies.""

Tvert told us that if we're talking legal marijuana use for individuals 21 and older, that's the case in only nine states (Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Colorado, Maine, Vermont and Massachusetts) plus Washington, D.C. and the Northern Mariana Islands. Also, 30 states allow medical marijuana use with a doctor's recommendation, he said. Nineteen states ""have laws on the books that acknowledge the medical value of medical cannabis, but fall short,"" the organization states on its website. Tvert explained that in those states some marijuana use is legal when it's for medical purposes, but there are limits on products authorized and who can access them. More specific, in some states, medical marijuana may be legal, but ""they don't have a legal form of production,"" or it's only available for a tiny number of people and for certain conditions, he said.

After we read O’Rourke’s claim to Tvert, he said the claim doesn’t strike him as incorrect. But how could O'Rourke have been more clear? Had he said most states have made marijuana legal in some form, ""it would be undeniably 100 percent accurate,"" Tvert said. Our ruling O’Rourke said marijuana is legal in most states. Only nine states have legalized marijuana use for all adults. But 30 have some form of legal use for medical purposes, giving O'Rourke's statement an element of truth. We rate his statement Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2018/oct/05/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-says-marijuana-legal-most-states/
"['Education', 'Illinois', 'Rahm Emanuel']","
Emanuel exaggerates what studies say about CPS
","Rahm Emanuel recently announced he won’t seek a third term as Chicago’s mayor, but he has continued to tout the city’s accolades, including recognition received in recent years for its improvements to public education. Last fall, we rated Mostly True a claim from a Chicago Public Schools press release that said its students were learning at a faster rate than their counterparts in 96 percent of U.S. school districts. That claim was based on findings from Stanford University that CPS students had improved at a faster rate on standardized test scores between third and eighth grade in recent years than their counterparts in most other U.S. school districts. But the report also noted that third- through eighth-graders in the nation’s third-largest district still perform below the national average, something the district’s glowing press release did not reflect. So we were curious what the mayor was referring to when he claimed a new title for CPS at a recent event: best among the nation’s largest districts. ""30 years ago ... William Bennett, Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Education, called the Chicago Public Schools the worst in the United States,"" Emanuel said while answering a question from an audience member at a forum hosted in Chicago by the New York-based Fortune magazine. ""Stanford, University of Chicago and the University of Illinois Chicago: all three, independently over 18 months came out and said it’s the best public school system in the United States of a major urban system."" Adam Collins, a spokesman for the mayor, pointed us to studies from each university that he said backed up the mayor’s claim. ""Reports from Stanford, the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois Chicago all identify CPS students as having the fastest growing or the highest attainment in the matter and context covered within each study,"" Collins wrote in an email. The Stanford report, from education equality expert Sean Reardon, was the same one CPS based its claim on last year. Reardon found Chicago had the highest test score growth rate between third and eighth grade of any large district in the nation. But nowhere does the report label CPS ""the best"" among large urban districts. ""We compared Chicago to the 100 largest school districts on measures of test score growth but not on other factors,"" Reardon said in a phone interview. The University of Chicago report cited by Emanuel’s office, which assessed college enrollment patterns among CPS graduates, was less analogous. It said the district’s four-year college enrollment rate of 44 percent exceeded that of New York City, Los Angeles, and Dallas and called the district ""a national leader in creating initiatives to support students in the transition to college."" But like the Stanford report, it did not go so far as to crown CPS’ school system the best overall among similar districts. It also noted that CPS’ community college enrollment rate was lower than rates for other urban school systems. The UIC report, meanwhile, found Chicago elementary students were outperforming their peers in the rest of the state on standardized tests in comparisons between demographically similar groups. But the study was limited to Illinois, meaning no other major urban districts were included. For national context, however, UIC researcher Paul Zavitkovsky did refer to Reardon’s report. Zavitkovsky also pointed us to Chicago’s recent performance on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, where the district’s eighth graders scored slightly above the 2017 average for large cities, ranking lower than three other major urban districts in both reading and math but higher in those subjects than more than a dozen others, including Los Angeles, D.C. and Dallas. ""I think the thing that’s fairest to say is that Chicago has made more progress toward school effectiveness than any large district in the country,"" Zavitkovsky said, adding that although academics must carefully define the terms of their research, the ""spirit"" of what the mayor said at the Fortune event was correct. Reardon took a similar view, noting that defining ""best"" remains something of an open question when it comes to evaluating school systems, complicated by the challenge of finding other measures of school quality tracked by all districts. He also pointed to college enrollment as another useful data point for making such an assessment. That context was missing entirely from the mayor’s remarks, however. Reardon’s research showing CPS students are improving the fastest among large districts comes closest to what Emanuel claimed. But even then, that’s far less emphatic than labeling CPS the best urban school system overall. Emanuel said Stanford, the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Chicago all pronounced CPS ""the best public school system in the United States of a major urban system."" The mayor’s blanket assertion contains an element of truth — and some very good news — in that reports from all three universities underscored significant strides the district has made and ranked CPS at or near top of the list on certain measures of performance. But Emanuel dispensed with all the nuance in proclaiming CPS the ""best"" overall among big city districts, a declaration beyond the scope of any of the academic studies he cited to underpin his boast. We rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/oct/05/rahm-emanuel/emanuel-exaggerates-what-studies-say-about-cps/

Hoagenson partially right on Missouri's poor road quality
","Does Missouri have the worst roads in the Midwest? Renee Hoagenson, Democratic candidate for the 4th Congressional District, thinks Missouri lags behind neighboring states in road quality. In an Aug. 28 tweet, Hoagenson claimed that ""#Missouri has the worst roads in the Midwest and nearly the worst roads in the country."" Hoagenson, who’s running against incumbent Republican Vicky Hartzler, argued the Trump administration’s plans to invest in infrastructure depends too much on privatization. Private companies would increase tolls and other costs for Missouri residents, Hoagenson claimed, and don’t create much union work. Experts we talked to agreed Missouri’s roads are severely underfunded. We’ve fact-checked other public officials’ comments about infrastructure quality, so we wanted to see where Missouri’s roads rank, and if they are as bad as Hoagenson says. Infrastructure experts told us there isn’t necessarily a formula for comparing state road quality. ""States vary slightly by how they define their pavement conditions,"" said Hussain Bahia, director of the Modified Asphalt Research Center at the University of Wisconsin, in an email. We wanted to explore the evidence anyway. Let’s start with Hoagenson’s tweet, which included a graphic listing the percentage of rural roads in poor condition by state, citing the TRIP 2017 Rural Roads Report. Rural roads make up 82 percent of the state’s total but cost less to maintain than major roadways. Hoagenson specified that Missouri has the worst roads in the Midwest. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Midwest region contains 12 states: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Missouri had a Midwest region high of 21 percent of rural roads in poor condition in the report. Missouri and Washington tied for 11th nationwide. ""So it can be derived that we have some of the worst roads in the country,"" Hoagenson said in an email. The American Society of Civil Engineers issues a national infrastructure report card every four years and assigns letter grades on 16 infrastructure categories, including roads. There are some state-level report cards, but these report cards are based on data compiled by a volunteer state-level committee, which is overseen by a national committee, said Greg DiLoreto, chair of the society’s committee on America’s infrastructure. Not every state has such a committee in place, and DiLoreto made it clear it does not rank categories or states. Missouri received a C- for overall infrastructure in 2018 and a D+ for roads, with 24 percent of the state’s public roads considered to be in poor condition. Wisconsin, which did not receive a letter grade, was the worst in the Midwest, with 27 percent of its public roads in poor condition. Some of the least maintained roads in the nation are in the Northeast: 54 percent of public roads in Rhode Island are in poor condition; Connecticut’s roads are at 57 percent. Wisconsin was the only Midwestern state to edge Missouri in how much it costs motorists to drive on bad roads, also computed by the engineering society. Wisconsin’s figure is an extra $637 per motorist per year. Missouri’s $604 is second-highest in the region. Prompted by Hoagenson, we tried another way of looking at rural road quality: the road maintenance funding ratio. According to the Citizen’s Guide to Transportation, produced by the Missouri Department of Transportation, the state has the seventh-largest road system in the country at 33,856 miles, and it ranks 46th nationally in revenue per mile. To Hoagenson, that’s very lopsided. More roads, less maintenance makes sense as at least one measure, according to William Buttlar, chair of MU’s Civil and Environmental Engineering Department. In 2016, Missouri spent $13,379 per state-controlled mile on road maintenance disbursements and $2,024 on administrative disbursements, according to a report sponsored by the nonprofit, non-partisan Reason Foundation on state highway performance. Maintenance spending was 12th-lowest in the country and administrative spending second-lowest, next to Kentucky. In the Midwest, South Dakota and North Dakota had smaller maintenance disbursements than Missouri. One more measure that Buttlar pointed out was the International Roughness Index. The index measures the impact of a road’s roughness on a vehicle’s suspension; the lower the IRI, the better the road. Missouri’s IRI data show 19.58 percent of roads considered not ""good"" or ""acceptable,"" the third-highest proportion in the Midwest and the 26th-highest in the country. Hoagenson claimed that ""Missouri has the worst roads in the Midwest and nearly the worst roads in the country."" Missouri did not rank worst in the Midwest on metrics we looked at except besides Hoagenson’s chosen graphic. That was only for the state’s rural roads. None of the measures, though, paints a smooth ride for Missouri’s roads. The state ranked near the bottom of the Midwest in nearly all important measures and fell in the bottom half of most rankings nationally. So, Hoagenson has a point that the state’s roads need work. For those reasons, we rate this claim Half-True.",/factchecks/2018/oct/05/renee-hoagenson/hoagenson-partially-right-missouris-poor-road-qual/

Fact-checking Patrick Morrisey on positions held by Joe Manchin
","In his battle to unseat U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Republican state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey is working hard to paint Manchin as a captive of his party even though West Virginia voters strongly back President Donald Trump. In a tweet on Aug. 31, Morrisey said, ""On life, guns, tax cuts, and coal, I stand with President @realDonaldTrump and West Virginia. Meanwhile, lying liberal Joe Manchin stands with Hillary Clinton and DC Dems on gun control, higher taxes, amnesty and Planned Parenthood. The choice could not be more clear. #WVsen."" On life, guns, tax cuts, and coal, I stand with President @realDonaldTrump and West Virginia. Meanwhile, lying liberal Joe Manchin stands with Hillary Clinton and DC Dems on gun control, higher taxes, amnesty, and Planned Parenthood. The choice could not be more clear. #WVsen In this fact-check, we’ll look at whether Morrisey had a point about Manchin’s stances on guns, taxes, immigration and Planned Parenthood. Manchin once received strong support from the National Rifle Association. But that’s not the case any more. In 2004, when Manchin was running for governor, he received an A-plus rating from the NRA and received the group’s endorsement when running for governor. And in 2010 and 2012, when Manchin was running for a U.S. Senate seat, he was endorsed by the NRA and received an A rating. ""Joe Manchin is committed to protecting the Right to Keep and Bear Arms guaranteed to all Americans,"" Chris Cox, chairman of the NRA Political Victory Fund, wrote in 2012. But Manchin’s relations with the NRA soured in 2013 after he and Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., proposed legislation that would have enacted tighter background checks for certain gun purchases. Manchin and Toomey framed the bill as a compromise, but the NRA saw it as the first step down a slippery slope and opposed it. (It never became law.) This year, the NRA gave Manchin a D and said it was airing ads on behalf of Morrisey in the Charleston and Bluefield markets. ""Contrary to what Joe Manchin says in West Virginia, he has supported the agenda of Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer by voting in favor of gun control in Washington, D.C.,"" Cox wrote this year. In an interview on CBS news in March 2018 — in the wake of the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. — Manchin defended his position as ""not gun control. It’s gun sense. … This bill of ours, the Manchin-Toomey bill, should be the base bill they work off of."" He also has signaled support for banning bump stocks and raising the legal age of purchasing assault rifles. Manchin added that he would not support a ban on AR-15s. When he was asked about the possibility of the ban, he said, ""I don’t have any friends that own the gun right now, I don’t know anyone who’s committed a crime with it, so I wouldn’t take their gun away."" ""Joe Manchin supports protecting West Virginians’ Second Amendment rights,"" said Manchin spokesman Grant Herring. ""Manchin is a lifetime NRA member. Manchin opposed banning assault weapons and sponsored and voted for legislation allowing concealed-carry reciprocity.""  The biggest tax vote in recent years came in December 2017, when the Senate considered a bill backed by President Trump and the GOP-controlled House that made major tax cuts and enacted other changes to the tax code. Manchin, like the chamber’s other Democrats, voted against passage, but the bill received enough Republican support to become law. Manchin’s vote against the bill isn’t exactly a vote for ""higher taxes"" — it was a vote to keep the status quo on taxes — but he did pass up the opportunity to lower taxes for many Americans, so this charge has some validity. Previously, we’ve reported that in 2012, Manchin voted for the ""Buffett Rule,"" which would have imposed a minimum effective tax rate for high-income taxpayers. He also supported legislation offered by the Bowles-Simpson commission, which was an attempt to balance the budget in a way that included tax increases as well as spending cuts. In 2013, Manchin voted in favor of the ""Gang of Eight"" bill that, among other things, would have set up a path to legal status and an eventual opportunity for citizenship. The ""Gang of Eight"" refers to a bipartisan group of eight senators — four Democrats and four Republicans — Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Lindsey Graham, R- S.C., and John McCain R-Ariz. It was endorsed by former President Barack Obama. The bill passed the Senate, 68-32, with 14 Republicans joining 54 Democrats and Democratic-caucusing independent senators in voting for it. (The bill did not get a hearing in the House and never became law.) Manchin was one of the Democrats who voted for it. But did it amount to amnesty? As we’ve concluded in the past, defining ""amnesty"" is tricky. Some view it as blanket permission for undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States, while others view amnesty as any measure that is favorable to any undocumented immigrants, even if it includes a list of tough measures they have to meet. Republicans who supported the legislation, along with most Democrats, argued that the bill did not offer amnesty. At the time, we concluded that the bill did not offer blanket legal residency to unauthorized immigrants. It mandated fines, background checks and waiting periods and was tougher than a 1986 law that was more in line with a traditional definition of ""amnesty."" ""This bill includes numerous punishments for unauthorized immigrants who broke the laws, including paying fines and other legal sanctions,"" Alex Nowrasteh with the libertarian Cato Institute told PolitiFact in 2013. ""If it was amnesty they would be legalized immediately with no punishment, no process. They would just be forgiven and handed a green card."" Since then, Manchin has sought to find a middle ground in the Senate. However, facing a tough reelection campaign in a solidly pro-Trump state, he has often emphasized his stance on toughening border security. We need more border patrol agents, drones, towers, ground sensors, thermal imaging, and Blackhawk helicopters at the border to ensure there is complete surveillance. In a press release from February 2018 — after the Senate failed to reach agreement on legislation protecting undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, along with new investments in border security — Manchin said, ""I share the president's commitment to border security. That’s why I voted for his plan."" Herring, his spokesman, added that Manchin ""also supports Kate's Law, which would increase penalties for criminals who re-enter the country illegally."" The national health and family-planning clinic network has been a longtime target of anti-abortion groups because it provides abortion services. By law, federal money cannot be used to pay for abortion services, but federal dollars do flow to Planned Parenthood for other purposes — something that rankles opponents of abortion, who say that money is fungible. We have previously looked at what Manchin has said and done about Planned Parenthood. Critics pointed to photos Manchin took with constituents carrying pro-Planned Parenthood signs, although he has also taken photos with supporters carrying anti-Planned Parenthood signs.  Manchin has said that he’s personally anti-abortion but supports federal funding for Planned Parenthood as long as the funding comports with existing federal law. In a statement to PolitiFact, Herring said that Manchin ""has always been pro-life. Planned Parenthood doesn’t receive taxpayer money for abortions. The only Planned Parenthood in WV provides basic health care services and screenings, and Sen. Manchin doesn’t want to take away health care from women."" Morrisey said Manchin ""stands with Hillary Clinton and DC Dems on gun control, higher taxes, amnesty, and Planned Parenthood."" We’re not entirely sure what Hillary Clinton has to do with this, but Morrisey can point to some evidence to support Manchin’s loyalty to Democratic orthodoxy in each of these four areas. That said, Morrisey glosses over important nuances. On guns and immigration, for instance, Manchin has often worked with Republicans to find common ground, rather than taking a strong Democratic line. On taxes, Manchin did vote against the Trump-backed tax bill, but his position would have left the tax code the same, rather than imposing ""higher taxes."" And Morrisey ignores Manchin’s personal anti-abortion position in focusing on Manchin’s support for Planned Parenthood; Manchin supports the status quo on federal funding, which is to provide it only for non-abortion services.

Did the United States recently become the No. 1 energy producer in the world? 
","Energy production -- particularly coal production --  has long been an integral part of West Virginia’s economy. During the 2016 presidential campaign, President Donald Trump vowed to send coal miners back to work and end the regulations on carbon emissions sought by President Barack Obama. Coal-producing states, particularly West Virginia, responded with strong support. So when Trump came to Wheeling, W.Va., for a rally on Sept. 29, it was no surprise that he touted the nation’s record in harnessing its energy resources. ""The United States is now the No. 1 energy producer in the world,"" Trump said at the rally. ""That happened just recently."" Is he correct? According to the Energy Information Administration, the federal office that collects energy statistics, 2017 data -- the most recent available -- shows that the United States ranks first in production of petroleum and other liquid fuels. The United States has a sizable lead over both Saudi Arabia and Russia.  It’s been a tighter contest for a subset of petroleum production -- crude oil production -- but the United States has a case for the top spot as well. EIA projections released in September 2018 show that the United States likely edged past Saudi Arabia and Russia in crude oil production sometime this summer.    The United States also ranks first in natural gas production, according to EIA data for 2015, the most recent year available. Russia is the only close competitor in this category.  This is the one category where the United States is not the leader. According to 2016 data from the Energy Information Administration, the United States ranked third, behind China -- the world’s clear leader -- and India.   Beyond the question of who’s No. 1, Trump also said that this achievement ""happened just recently.""

Trump said, ""The United States is now the No. 1 energy producer in the world. That happened just recently."" The United States does rank first internationally in petroleum, crude oil, and natural gas production, though it ranks third in the world in coal production.

""He didn't just say ‘Gee, I was in the service.’ No, he said, ‘I was in the Marines. Da Nang province. Soldiers dying left and right as we battled up the hill.’ This went on for 15 years when he was the attorney general of Connecticut. I thought he was a great war hero."" Trump continued. ""Here's a guy who was saying people were dying all around him. And he was never there. And then he cried when they caught him. He cried like a baby, like a baby."" In a companion fact-check, we looked at Trump’s claim that Blumenthal ""lied"" about his Vietnam service. (Mostly True.) Here, we look at the rest of Trump’s words, the ones about Da Nang and crying. Trump is wrong that Blumenthal spun heroic war stories, and cried when he was called out for it. Both Blumenthal and Trump avoided serving in Vietnam. Trump benefited from four student deferments in college and one medical deferment (which Trump later said was for bone spurs in his heels), before being classified 4-F, unfit to serve. While Trump never claimed to have been there, Blumenthal sometimes did. Blumenthal enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserves in 1970. Until then, five deferments had kept him out of the war. Getting a coveted slot in the reserves reduced the chance of battlefield deployment. Blumenthal went through basic training and served six years in the Washington, D.C, area and Connecticut. In 2010, the New York Times reported that at a 2008 ceremony for veterans and senior citizens, Blumenthal said, ""We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam.""   The newspaper provided another example from a 2003 event. ""When we returned, we saw nothing like this,"" Blumenthal told military families. ""Let us do better by this generation of men and women."" A day after the New York Times story, Blumenthal held a news conference in West Hartford, Conn. ""I routinely describe my pride at having served in the United States Marine Corps Reserves during the Vietnam era,"" Blumenthal said, flanked by veterans. ""On a few occasions, I have misspoken about my service. And I regret that, and I take full responsibility."" There were no tears. Some argued that there also was no apology. Blumenthal released a statement about a week later saying, ""I have made mistakes and I am sorry."" We can find no record that Blumenthal ever described being in Da Nang or any other place in Vietnam. (And for the record, Da Nang is a city, not a province, although it serves the same administrative role as a province in Vietnamese governance.) We reached out to the White House and did not hear back. Trump said Blumenthal said he saw battle in Da Nang, and ""then he cried when they caught him."" Blumenthal never spoke of fighting in Da Nang or anywhere else in Vietnam. He did not cry when he acknowledged his misleading statements. Those elements are pure Trump invention.

At a rally in Southaven, Miss., President Donald Trump went from disparaging Ford to denouncing Blumenthal. Trump dubbed Blumenthal ""Da Nang Richard,"" a reference to a battleground in the Vietnam War. ""This guy lied about his service,"" Trump said Oct. 2. Trump went on to embellish his attack on Blumenthal’s credibility, adding a couple of invented details that we rated False in a companion fact-check.  But here, we focus on whether Blumenthal ever misled about his military service. By his own admission, he did. As Blumenthal was running for U.S. Senate in 2010, the New York Times reported that on a couple of occasions, he had talked inaccurately about his Vietnam years. Blumenthal enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserves in 1970. Until then, five deferments had kept him out of the war. Getting a coveted slot in the reserves reduced the chance of battlefield deployment. Blumenthal went through basic training and served six years in the Washington, D.C area and Connecticut. As Connecticut’s Attorney General, Blumenthal regularly attended Memorial Day parades and other events that recognized soldiers and veterans. The New York Times wrote May 17, 2010, that in 2003, Blumenthal had spoken at a rally supporting troops overseas. The newspaper reported that Blumenthal said, ""When we returned, we saw nothing like this."" That was a comparison with soldiers who came back from Vietnam. Blumenthal repeated a similar line at a 2007 Memorial Day parade in Milford, Conn. And at a 2008 ceremony for veterans and senior citizens, Blumenthal said, ""We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam.""   At the same event, he first said he served ""during the Vietnam era."" It was later in his remarks that he spoke of actually being there. So, at three public events, Blumenthal clearly placed himself in Vietnam. But at other times, his words reflected his actual resume. During a televised candidate forum March 1, 2010, two months before the New York Times article, Blumenthal distinguished between serving ""during"" and ""in"" the war. ""Although I did not serve in Vietnam, I have seen first-hand the effects of military action,"" he said. Over the years, newspapers described his military service in different ways. In 2003, the Connecticut Post referred to Blumenthal as ""a former Marine sergeant who served in Vietnam."" The paper repeated that in a 2008 article, but in 2009, called him ""a Marine sergeant during the Vietnam era."" The New Haven Register wrote in 2007 of him as, ""Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who served with the Marines in Vietnam."" At the time, Blumenthal did not correct any of those descriptions.

""On a few occasions, I have misspoken about my service. And I regret that, and I take full responsibility."" Blumenthal released a statement about a week later saying, ""I have made mistakes and I am sorry."" Trump said Blumenthal lied about serving in Vietnam. On at least three occasions, Blumenthal did say things that placed him actually in Vietnam. At other times, he was more careful, saying he served ""during"" the war.

Now, Lanny Lancaster, Cabarrus County GOP chairman, has shared a photo allegedly of Ford, one of Kavanaugh’s accusers, that was originally posted on Facebook by an account under the name Joseph T. Mannarino. Lancaster shared the photo, which shows a young woman wearing braces and large glasses, adding the comment: ""This is the alleged sexual assault victim. Wow."" On Oct. 2, Democratic congressional candidate Frank McNeill included the post in an email newsletter as an example of a Republican ""assault on the safety and dignity of American women.""

Beto O'Rourke says that in Texas, you can be 'too gay' to adopt a foster child
","At a lakeside Austin rally mostly celebrating the potential of Texas to lead the nation, Democratic U.S. Senate nominee Beto O’Rourke made a claim about gay residents being kept from adopting children in need. O’Rourke, the El Paso congressman challenging first-term Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, said Sept. 29, 2018: ""In this state, with 30,000 kids in the foster care system —a foster care system so under-resourced that recently kids were sleeping on top of or underneath the desks in CPS (Child Protective Services) offices—in this state, they say that under the guise of religious liberty that you can be too gay to adopt one of those children who needs a loving home."" We wondered: Can a Texan be ""too gay"" to adopt a child in foster care? When we asked, Chris Evans of O’Rourke’s campaign told us that O’Rourke’s claim was based on the Texas Legislature’s action in 2017 known as House Bill 3859. The measure, signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott, says that groups can decline to provide social services to a person if that person’s beliefs conflict with the group’s ""sincerely held religious beliefs."" In this case, that would mean that a social service group that arranges adoptions could refuse to allow a gay couple to adopt a child through that group. Critics of the measure say that gay Texans are being refused adoption opportunities. Backers of the legislation and a state agency say the law does not keep any qualified adults, including gay residents, from adopting. We read the law and noticed that it doesn’t explicitly bar services to anyone based on sexual orientation, including adoption. The law says that if a group opts to decline service to someone, the group must direct the person to another service provider or to a state list of providers. Opponents of the proposal—-including Equality Texas, which says it seeks to secure ""full equality"" for LGBTQ Texans—maintain that the law hastens discrimination based on sexual orientation or other factors. In Texas House debate on the measure in May 2017, the Texas Tribune reported, Democratic legislators warned that the plan would give groups license to discriminate against gay — or Jewish or divorced — parents who want to foster or adopt. A subsequent blog post by the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ civil rights advocacy group, that said that under the law, state ""contractors who provide child welfare services can discriminate against qualified same-sex couples seeking to care for a child in need—including LGBTQ couples, interfaith couples, single parents, married couples in which one prospective parent has previously been divorced, or other parents to whom the agency has a religious objection."" After O'Rourke made his 2018 claim, we reached out to Chuck Smith of Equality Texas. Smith indicated by email that Texas doesn’t prohibit adoptions by same-sex couples. Still, he said, if ""you were to ask a provider like Catholic Charities if being just a little bit gay is OK with them, you’d learn that they think that ‘any gay’ is ‘too gay’ when it comes to working with prospective adoptive parents."" In that vein, O’Rourke’s statement was accurate, Smith said. ""For some licensed providers in Texas, including Catholic Charities, you can be too gay to adopt a foster child,"" Smith wrote. By phone, Jennifer Allmon of the Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops offered a kind of confirmation, saying the conference helps married mothers and fathers adopt. ""Catholics believe fathers are men and mothers are women,"" Allmon said. Allmon also noted the law's requirement that anyone refused a service be referred to other providers. Smith said he’s not aware of statistics or independent research on the extent to which the law ""has been used by certain providers to refuse to work with LGBTQ people."" Advocates say adoptions not prevented Advocates of the law say it doesn’t deter adoptions by gay Texans. State Rep. James Frank, R-Wichita Falls, who authored HB 3859, told us that nothing in the law ""would stop a same-sex couple from adopting or serving as foster parents in Texas."" He added: ""There are existing providers today who place children in same-sex households.""  Franks was quoted in a May 2017 Associated Press news story speculating that different parents would choose different adoption paths. Frank said then that most adoptions happened through the state’s child protective services agency, which would not be subject to the religious freedom mandate, though outside agencies that receive state funding would be. ""My guess is if you have an LGBT agency they’re going to pick an LGBT family, and if you have a Baptist agency they may be more likely to pick a Baptist family,"" Frank told the AP. ""They’re free to do that and should be free to do that."" Allmon, who testified in favor of Frank’s measure, suggested to us that the law drove up adoptions. ""By allowing faithful engagement for those who are motivated to serve because of their religious convictions, the bill expands the diversity of competent providers and loving, stable families who can help the children of Texas,"" Allmon wrote. ""For example, the Texas Bishops launched a major parish based foster care recruitment and retention ministry, The St. Joseph Ministry, in March 2018. A bilingual parish toolkit has been sent to all 1,300 Catholic parishes in Texas to encourage parishes and parishioners to engage in the important work of serving those involved with the foster care system in Texas."" State agency says gay adoptions not deterred A key state agency told us that, generally, a person’s sexual orientation isn’t considered in its placements of children in foster care. Patrick Crimmins of the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, which oversees a website connecting adoptive parents with foster children awaiting adoption, said by email: ""While HB 3859 protects the religious beliefs of child-placing agencies and adoption agencies, that DOES NOT mean that a qualified individual cannot foster or adopt – it simply means that person should select an agency that will accept his or her application to foster or adopt."" Crimmins said Texas has 133 foster/adoption agencies, some with religious affiliations. ""The point is that there are plenty to choose from,"" Crimmins wrote. In the 12 months through August 2018, Crimmins said, 5,636 children were adopted out of foster care statewide. As of September 2018, he said, 3,811 children in foster care needed an adoptive parent. Crimmins said the agency keeps no count of private adoptions. Our ruling O’Rourke said at an Austin rally that in Texas, ""you can be too gay to adopt"" a foster child ""who needs a loving home."" Contrary to the implication in O'Rourke's statement, Texas has no law against adoption by gay parents. LGBTQ Texans can, and do, become adoptive parents through any number of processes. Still, O'Rourke is partially accurate in that a 2017 Texas law allows essentially allows faith-based groups to refuse to help gay Texans adopt.  On our Texas Truth-O-Meter, that fits the definition of Half True.",/factchecks/2018/oct/04/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-says-texas-you-can-be-too-gay-adopt-n/

Does Ohio's Mike DeWine want to get rid of pre-existing condition coverage?
","A TV ad by Democrat Richard Cordray in Ohio attacks Republican Mike DeWine for his position on pre-existing conditions as part of the Affordable Care Act. ""If insurance companies do not have to pay for pre-existing conditions my son won’t get the blood thinners he needs,"" said the woman in the TV ad. ""There’s plenty of people that just cannot survive without their medications. When I heard that Mike DeWine wanted to allow insurance companies to refuse to pay for pre-existing conditions it made me sick to my stomach."" DeWine later countered with his own TV ad in which his daughter says DeWine ""supports health care coverage for people with pre-existing conditions."" We wanted to fact-check Cordray’s ad to see if DeWine wanted to allow insurance companies to refuse to pay for pre-existing conditions. DeWine isn't the only Republican to oppose Obamacare while stating support for the popular protection for pre-existing conditions.  Looking over Dewine’s entire record, we find that he was a strong opponent of the Affordable Care Act for years, but now is staking out a more moderate position. DeWine’s campaign said that he has shown support for pre-existing coverage stretching back to the 1990s when he campaigned for and then won a seat in the U.S. Senate. In 1994, DeWine wrote on a survey by the Ohio Nurses Association that ""pre-existing conditions must no longer be a bar to insurance."" For example, in 1996 he voted along with the entire Senate in favor of a health insurance accountability bill that placed limits on pre-existing condition exclusions, among other things. But as attorney general, DeWine has fought against the federal health care law. On his first day in office in 2011, DeWine joined a multistate lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act. DeWine called the health care law a ""huge federal overreach"" because it mandated individuals to purchase insurance or face a penalty. He didn’t mention pre-existing conditions, but the law guarantees coverage for people who have them. When the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate in 2012, DeWine said he was disappointed in the outcome. As attorney general, the first references we could find of DeWine defending pre-existing condition coverage were from this year. For example, DeWine said during a September gubernatorial debate, ""I’ve always been for coverage of people pre-existing illnesses."" More recently, DeWine has not joined either side of a multistate lawsuit filed in a Texas federal court in February by Republican attorney generals and governors. That lawsuit argues that the law is no longer constitutional because Congress gutted the individual mandate as part of the 2017 tax overhaul. DeWine didn’t join the lawsuit because he believes it's up to Congress to decide whether to repeal Obamacare via that route, his office spokesman Dan Tierney told PolitiFact. DeWine argues that it’s possible to oppose the law and the mandate, while keeping pre-existing condition coverage. But that’s not what the federal government has said. The Justice Department said in a legal brief that the individual mandate is inseparable from protections for people with pre-existing conditions. That’s because if there were no mandate, people would wait until they were sick to purchase health insurance. Cordray’s ad said, ""Mike DeWine wanted to allow insurance companies to refuse to pay for pre-existing conditions."" DeWine was a strong opponent of the Affordable Care Act, joining a lawsuit to fight against it in 2011. DeWine argues his opposition was over the individual mandate, but if the lawsuit had prevailed it, would have struck down a law that guaranteed coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. This year, while being attacked over his health care record, DeWine said he has favored coverage for pre-existing conditions and pointed to his record decades earlier in the U.S. Senate.  We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2018/oct/04/richard-cordray/does-ohios-mike-dewine-want-get-rid-pre-existing-c/

In New York, Antonio Delgado misleads in claiming John Faso voted for an 'age tax' on seniors
","Congressional hopeful Antonio Delgado is pitting U.S. Rep. John Faso against his senior constituents. The Democratic candidate is challenging the Republican incumbent for the House seat in New York’s 19th Congressional District, located in the Hudson Valley and the Catskill Mountains. The district voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 by a margin of 6.8 percentage points. In a recent TV ad, Delgado says that Faso ""paved the way for an age tax on seniors,"" while onscreen text displays that ""Faso voted for an age tax on seniors."" So did Faso vote in favor of a new ""age tax"" on senior citizens? That’s an exaggeration. Delgado’s claim is a lot like other attacks we’ve seen against GOP House members who supported the American Health Care Act in 2017, as Faso did. (He voted in a committee that advanced the bill.) The failed attempt by Republicans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act would have allowed insurers to hike premiums for certain older enrollees from up to five times more than what they would charge younger adults. The current law sets the cap at up to three times as much. The bill also would have allowed states to set a different ratio. But the ad fails to mention a few things. It doesn’t apply to seniors on Medicare, or to people over the age of 50 with medical coverage sponsored by large employers. It also wasn’t a ""tax"" imposed by the government — the phrase ""age tax"" was dubbed by AARP, because the legislation was expected to increase premiums for the elderly. And — probably most importantly in this case — it doesn’t apply to New Yorkers. In a news release, the Faso campaign argued that the plan would have had no impact on New York seniors because the state already restricts insurers from billing customers varying amounts based on age. The bill was voted into state law in the early 1990s. Faso cites the Empire Center for Public Policy, a fiscally conservative think tank out of Albany, which marked Delgado’s claim as ""particularly misleading in the context of New York State’s insurance market."" In response, Delgado’s spokeswoman, Melissa Toufanian, said that while the age ratings wouldn’t have affected New Yorkers, Faso still voted for something that would have had negative consequences for seniors across the country. We also found that when he was an assemblyman, Faso actually voted against the bill prohibiting age rating when it came across the New York State Assembly in 1992. Despite his vote, the legislation passed with bipartisan support in a 118-25 vote and was signed into law, records show.   Delgado said in an ad that opponent Faso ""voted for an age tax on seniors."" The claim refers to Faso’s 2017 vote for the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare, which would have permitted insurers to raise premiums on individuals over age 50 up to five times more than what they charged younger adults. However, the provision didn’t apply to those on Medicare, or people over the age of 50 with coverage through large employers. Also, it wouldn’t have affected New York seniors, as the state has prohibited insurers from charging higher rates based on age since the early 1990s. The claim contains elements of truth but glosses over details and ignores critical facts.

"['Voting Record', 'Illinois', 'Brendan Kelly']","
In Illinois, Brendan Kelly wants to cash in on a Mike Bost vote
","In Washington, Mike Bost has agreed consistently that Congress members, earning $174,00 a year, don’t need a pay raise. But the Illinois Republican spent two decades in his state’s General Assembly before his 2014 election to Congress, and in one of those years -- 11 years ago -- he voted for a 9.6 percent pay raise for state lawmakers. You can guess where this is going. ""While southern Illinois families struggled, Bost voted to raise his own pay."" So said a campaign ad from his Democratic challenger, Brendan Kelly. Is this true? The suggestion is that Bost took care of himself and his lawmaker friends rather than the taxpayers. But Bost’s record of voting against pay raises is much longer. In 2007, the Illinois General Assembly was trying to pass a 75-page, multipart supplemental spending bill to fund schools, multiple state agencies and employee salaries. By the time it came up for a final vote, other lawmakers had included a measure to raise the assembly’s pay, with rank-and-file members’ salaries rising to $63,143 from $57,619. The Legislature had not received a raise, even one to cover cost-of-living increases, in several years, but this was controversial nevertheless because of claims that the state had bigger priorities, and limited resources. Supporters of the bill said its passage was essential -- not because of the pay raise but because the underlying bill contained multiple other state funding measures. That’s why Bost said he voted yes. He had voted no the previous year on a similar measure with a proposed 9.6 percent pay hike. Bost had also voted against pay raises numerous other times, his campaign and Illinois media said. WSIL-TV, an Illinois ABC affiliate, reported that while in the Illinois Legislature, ""Bost voted against pay increases for lawmakers more than a dozen times, and even voted to require furlough days for legislators, actually reducing compensation."" The Belleville News-Democrat, examining Illinois General Assembly documents, found the same thing in its own examination. Now in Congress nearly four years, Bost has voted to freeze congressional pay 12 times. The number of votes exceeds his time in Congress because annual spending bills typically go through several stages, requiring several votes. This is about pay raises, but inflation-linked cost-of-living, or COLA, increases are also a form of a raise. Unless blocked by the Legislature, Illinois grants COLA adjustments automatically, a result of an independent compensation board’s decision decades ago. When counting votes against pay raises, Bost and the Illinois media generally include Bost’s multiple votes to skip the COLA hikes But there was an instance in 2010, confirmed by PolitiFact in Illinois legislative records, when Bost voted yes on a floor amendment to suspend a COLA hike and require legislators to take 12 furlough days -- yet when the measure got attached to a much broader budget bill, Bost voted no on that bill. He said he could not support the bill other reasons. Technically speaking, that meant he voted against the final legislators' COLA freeze and furlough. The same pay provisions came up the next year, however, in a clean bill pertaining only to lawmaker compensation -- and Bost voted for the cuts. Kelly's ad says Bost ""voted to raise his own pay."" There is one 2007 vote that is not in question. Bost’s campaign spokesman said Bost voted for the bill despite that distasteful element, because so many other provisions were essential for the state. But Bost voted repeatedly against other pay hikes -- not only the COLAs but a 9.6 percent proposed pay hike in a 2006 bill as well. If counting, those votes outnumbered the 2007 vote. Looking at his overall record gives a very different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/oct/03/brendan-kelly/illinois-brendan-kelly-wants-cash-mike-bost-vote/

Leah Vukmir cites Tammy Baldwin inaction on Tomah VA scandal, but lacks evidence of 'cover up'
","On the campaign trail and in radio talk show interviews, Leah Vukmir has attacked U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin for months over the scandal at the Department of Veterans Affairs medical center in Tomah, Wis., where veterans were over prescribed opioid painkillers. But as the Nov. 6, 2018, election draws nearer, the Republican challenger’s attacks on the Democratic incumbent are reaching a crescendo. Vukmir hammered Baldwin again over the Tomah VA scandal on TV public affairs programs that aired Sept. 23, 2018 in Green Bay and in Madison. They were something of a prelude to a TV attack ad on the scandal that Vukmir aired three days later. So, let’s take a look at one of the attacks. Vukmir was asked on ""Capital City Sunday"" on WKOW-TV in Madison how she would have handled the Tomah VA matter differently. She responded by claiming that Baldwin was the only member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation ""to have a report outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids"" at the Tomah VA, ""later a veteran died"" and Baldwin ""covered it up."" All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. Let’s break down the three-part attack, starting with a quick review about what we know about Tomah. Problems at the Tomah VA first made news in January 2015, when the California-based Center for Investigative Reporting exposed the overprescription of opioid drugs by the facility. Doctors were handing out so many narcotic painkillers that some veterans had taken to calling the place ""Candy Land."" The attacks on Baldwin began in early 2017 from a super PAC largely funded by Republican Richard Uihlein, co-founder of Uline, a Wisconsin shipping and packaging supplies distributor. The group claimed in a radio ad that Baldwin was told by a whistleblower about ""overmedicated veterans,"" she made ""deadly mistakes"" and ""three veterans died."" We rated that False, based on how and when the deaths occurred and the ""deadly mistakes"" part of the claim. Now to Vukmir’s claim, which doesn’t go so far as to blame Baldwin for a death. The first part of Vukmir’s claim is that, among the Wisconsin members of the U.S. House and Senate, only Baldwin received a report ""outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids"" at the Tomah VA."" The report was done by the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Office of Inspector General following a 2½-year investigation of Tomah. Baldwin’s office received it on Aug. 29, 2014. Baldwin did not make the report public, though she shared it with a constituent who had complained to her about what was happening at Tomah. The report was not given to any other member of Congress at the time. So, Baldwin had been informed about the problems at the Tomah VA before they were exposed publicly. And she doesn’t dispute that she was the first member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation to get the report. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Former Marine Jason Simcakoski died of a ""mixed use toxicity"" overdose at the Tomah VA while being treated by doctors there. Simcakoski had checked himself into the facility citing an addiction to painkillers and severe anxiety. He was prescribed 15 drugs, including anti-psychotics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants and the opioid painkiller tramadol. Simcakoski death, however, occurred Aug. 30, 2014  — just one day after Baldwin received the VA inspector general’s report about Tomah that Vukmir highlights. So, it’s misleading to say ""later a veteran died,"" given that Baldwin had not had time to act on the report. The third part of Vukmir’s claim is that Baldwin ""covered it up""  — a reference to the entire Tomah VA matter, not solely to Simcakoski’s death. In the interview, Vukmir elaborates by saying Baldwin tried to ""fire one of her aides that brought the issue forward, offering the aide ""taxpayer hush money"" and hiring ""Hillary Clinton's attorneys"" to ""cover this up."" Let’s break down these sub-points. An important point: It’s clear Baldwin did not take steps publicly on the scandal until the Center for Investigative Reporting’s expose  — months after she received the inspector general’s report and Simcakoski’s death. At the same time, there is no evidence that she took active steps to cover up the matter. Firing: Baldwin did fire an aide, but it’s not entirely clear she did so because the aide ""brought the issue forward."" In January 2015, after the Center for Investigative Reporting’s expose, Baldwin had called for the VA to investigate Tomah but remained under fire for inaction on the scandal. Baldwin then fired Marquette Baylor, her deputy state director, without explanation, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel revealed. Whistleblower and former Tomah VA employee Ryan Honl told the newspaper he had talked with Baylor for two hours in late November 2014 about the Tomah VA and that she discouraged him from going public with his concerns, saying that doing so might get her and others fired. Baylor later said she had prepared three memos on the Tomah situation for Baldwin's review and forwarded them to her supervisors; she alleged they were either not delivered to Baldwin or were ignored by Baldwin. ‘Hush money’, Clinton lawyer: Baldwin did offer a severance payment to the fired aide and did hire a Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer. But this needs further explanation. As part of the firing, Baldwin's office offered a severance package to Baylor that would have included a confidentiality agreement and a payment, the Journal Sentinel reported. Attorney Marc Elias, who was the top lawyer in Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, was hired by Baldwin with campaign funds to review how her office handled the Tomah VA matter. He said the U.S. Senate's chief employment lawyer had helped put together the offer and described the confidentiality clause as routine. Baldwin later said the deal would have included a payment of about $17,000, which would have been from Senate funds. Baylor later rejected the offer and, according to Baldwin, sought more than four times that amount. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. Elias said Baylor’s handling of the Tomah VA matter was only one reason she was fired. ‘Cover up’: In addition to not releasing the inspector general report, Baldwin was slow to address the Tomah VA matter publicly. But ethics complaints filed against her alleging a cover up were found to have no merit. Baldwin avoided questions about the matter for weeks after the Center for Investigative Reporting’s expose; and it took attorney Elias nearly a month to confirm Baylor’s firing. After being fired, Baylor filed an ethics complaint accusing Baldwin of engaging in a political cover up by firing her for her alleged role in the mishandling of a whistleblower complaint. The complaint asked the U.S. Senate Ethics Select Committee to investigate Baldwin. The committee dismissed Baylor’s complaint and two similar complaints filed by groups, saying they lacked merit. Vukmir says Baldwin was the only member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation ""to have a report outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids"" at the Tomah VA, ""later a veteran died"" and Baldwin ""covered it up."" Baldwin was the only one, and she didn’t make the report public or go public with her concerns until the scandal made news. But she received the report only a day before the veteran died. On the cover up part of the claim, there was on inaction on Baldwin’s part -- not releasing the report, declining for weeks to answer questions and to confirm that she had fired a top aide. But there is no evidence Baldwin took active steps to cover up the matter, and a Senate committee determined that Baldwin had not engaged in a cover up. For a statement that contains elements of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/oct/03/leah-vukmir/leah-vukmir-partially-accurate-faulting-tammy-bald/
