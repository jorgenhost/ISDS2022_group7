Kamala Harris slightly off in claim about veterans suicides
"," In her campaign for U.S. Senate, California Attorney General Kamala Harris has pledged to ""clean up"" the scandals and reduce wait times at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The issue, Harris has said, is a matter of life and death. ""It is unconscionable that 22 veterans take their own lives each day. We must ensure that they have support to adjust to civilian life,"" Harris, a Democrat, said on Twitter on August 18, 2016.  Harris made the same claim about veterans suicides on her website here, where she adds that she’ll work ""to ensure that every Veteran knows what benefits they earned and how to access those benefits."" We wondered whether the suicide statistic Harris used is correct.   Checking a somber number Her campaign spokesman said Harris used a widely-cited figure of 22 suicides per day from the VA’s 2012 Suicide Data Report, which examined veterans deaths in 21 states, from 1999 to 2011. That study’s researchers, as noted by the Washington Post Fact Checker, cautioned against the use of the 22-deaths figure more than once in the study: ""It is recommended that the estimated number of veterans be interpreted with caution due to the use of data from a sample of states."" Researchers gave a range of 18 to 22 veteran suicides a day. Harris chose the high-end of this range. Importantly, Harris’ figure of 22 suicides per day fails to account for research the VA released in July for its most comprehensive report yet on veteran suicides. The VA examined about 55 million veterans records from 1979 through 2014. It found that in 2014, the latest year for which figures are available, 7,403 veterans took their own lives, or an average of about 20 a day. That’s close to the 22 suicides per day cited by Harris, a figure that continues to be used by many others despite the new, more extensive research. It does not take away from the point Harris is trying to make: That the rate of veterans suicide is far too high. VA figures show that in 2014 veterans accounted for 18 percent of all deaths from suicides among adults in the United States while they made up only 8.5 percent of the population.  Capital Public Radio / File photo One prominent voice in American politics has cited the new number. PolitiFact Virginia rated a claim by Donald Trump in July that ""a shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day, especially our older veterans,"" as True, based on this new report. PolitiFact Virginia added that the VA always acknowledged that this old study (from 2012) was limited. Notably absent were records for California and Texas — two states with very high veteran populations. The new figure of 20 veteran suicides a day is based on records from every state. When asked, Harris’ campaign spokesman acknowledged there has been new research. ""Kamala believes strongly we must work hard to get that number to zero,"" the spokesman added. Old study widely cited Harris is not the only person to cite the 22 suicides per day statistic from the old study. Her opponent and fellow Democrat in the race for U.S. Senate — U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez — has repeated it, including in this video posted in November 2015. Our ruling Kamala Harris recently said ""22 veterans take their own lives each day."" The number she cites relies on data from a 2012 VA study by the VA, which was limited and included caveats. That old report has been widely cited by Republicans and Democrats, including Harris’ opponent in her run for U.S. Senate. But Harris’ claim ignores research the VA released in July for its most comprehensive report yet on veteran suicides, with records from all states. The new study found an average of about 20 veterans a day, two fewer than what Harris claimed. Harris’ statement is close, but needs clarification or additional information. We rate her claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Clinton says almost a half-million immigrants still eligible for DACA, particularly Asians
","Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has presented herself as an advocate for immigrants, saying she’ll push for immigration reform within her first 100 days in the Oval Office and promising to continue the deferred deportation plans of President Barack Obama. On Aug. 15 — four years to the day since immigration officials began accepting Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals applications — she published a post on Medium directed to those who have applied for the deportation relief program and to those who haven’t. ""In America, the place of your birth should never be a barrier that stops you from reaching your God-given potential  —  that’s what makes our country great, and that’s the promise I’m going to fight to fulfill,"" Clinton wrote. She said a sizable amount of immigrants could still apply for the program. ""Experts estimate almost half a million people are still eligible, particularly in the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community,"" Clinton wrote. We wondered if Clinton was right about the estimated number of eligible applicants, and whether the Asian and Pacific Islander communities represented an outsized proportion. Clinton’s campaign directed us to an August report published by the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute analyzing DACA application rates. The study found that application rates were ""generally very low"" for immigrants born in Asia. DACA background The Homeland Security Department, which oversees immigration enforcement, announced Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, in June 2012. It was designed to defer deportation for undocumented immigrants 30 years old or younger and who arrived in the United States before they were 16 years old. Applicants have to meet several criteria to be considered, including having continuously lived in the United States since June 15, 2007, and be in school, have graduated or obtained a GED certificate, or be an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or U.S. armed forces. Applicants also cannot have felony convictions, a significant misdemeanor or three or more misdemeanors, nor can they be be a threat to national security or public safety. Advocates argue that those who were brought to the country by their parents as children should be given opportunities to stay in the country since they likely weren’t the ones making decisions to migrate or to stay in the country illegally. DACA does not grant lawful status, but people who receive DACA are not considered to be ""unlawfully present"" during their time of deferred action. DACA defers deportation for two-year periods, it can be renewed and beneficiaries can also apply for work permits. This summer, the Supreme Court deadlocked in a 4-4 decision on an extended version of DACA and on a deferred action program for parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, which allowed an appellate court’s injunction to stand. That decision does not affect the original DACA. DACA eligible population Back to Clinton’s point: We wondered how many unauthorized immigrants are eligible and how many have applied. When it comes to the undocumented population, what’s usually available are just estimates. The Migration Policy Institute report is based on a formula using federal immigration data and Census Bureau survey data. The report offers two sets of eligible applicants: 1.3 million and 1.7 million. The institute found that about 1.3 million unauthorized immigrants were immediately eligible for DACA in 2016  — they met all criteria, including high school completion or school enrollment. About 400,000 more met DACA criteria except high school completion or school enrollment requirement in 2014. The additional 400,000 may have become eligible for DACA by enrolling in an adult education program — bringing the total eligible population in 2016 to about 1.7 million, the institute said. As of March 31, 2016, immigration officials had accepted about 820,000 (meaning they can begin going through the deferred-action process). Of the nearly 820,000 accepted, officials approved 728,285. So of the 1.3 million immediately eligible population, about 480,000 can still apply. By assuming up to 1.7 million are eligible, then there could be up to 880,000 who can still apply for DACA. Clinton is right that immigrants from the Asian and Pacific Islander population comprise a large chunk of people who can still apply. South Korea ranked fourth among the top five countries of birth for the immediately eligible DACA population in 2016 (after Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador), according to the institute. Honduras was fifth. But only 7,000 of the estimated 49,000 eligible South Koreans have applied. And less than 30 percent of about 33,000 eligible immigrants from India and the Philippines have applied. Multiple immigration scholars and experts we reached out to cited MPI’s research as a credible base for DACA estimates. There are more than 130,000 undocumented immigrants of Asian descent eligible for DACA, according to estimates cited by the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The group also noted back in 2014 that DACA enrollment from Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders was ""disproportionately low."" Mexican-born immigrants represented 63 percent of the immediately eligible DACA population and 78 percent of them have applied, according to MPI. New America Media, a national collaboration of 3,000 ethnic news organizations, reported earlier this month that applications from Asians and Pacific Islanders may be at lower rates because those communities may not know they can apply. Some of the reasons they have not applied may include fear of immigration agencies, cultural stigma in speaking about immigration status, shortage of community resources about DACA in languages spoken by Asians and Pacific Islanders, and few portrayals of deportation relief as an issue for their communities, said Sheridan Lagunas, a spokesperson for United We Dream, a youth-led immigrant rights national group. Our ruling In a Medium post, Clinton said, ""experts estimate almost half a million people are still eligible (for DACA), particularly in the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community."" Researchers have estimated the number of eligible DACA recipients might be around 1.3 million to 1.7 million people, with immigration officials having accepted about 820,000 applications. Based on varying estimates, that leaves about 500,000 to nearly 900,000 people who can still apply. Immigration advocates and scholars have said Asian American and Pacific Islander application rates are lower compared to other populations, likely due to lack of information. We rate Clinton’s statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3a0188dc-1fd5-4886-9ab0-3646af62b99d",[<zip object at 0x000002809C01CB00>],/factchecks/2016/aug/22/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-almost-half-million-people-still-elig/

Tim Kaine correct about how poorly U.S. fares in percentage of women lawmakers
","Hillary Clinton is running to become the first female president in American history. But even as she makes her potentially historic run, the number of women in Congress remains far from parity with men, said Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine. ""In Congress right now, we're doing the best job we have ever done in women in the Federal legislature, 19 percent,"" said Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia. ""That's the best job we've ever done. Hold on for this, folks: Nineteen percent ranks the United States 75th in the world, below the global average. Iraq is 26 percent. Afghanistan, 28 percent. Number one? Rwanda, 64 percent."" We wondered if Kaine is correct that ""in Congress right now, we're doing the best job we have ever done in women in the federal legislature,"" but it’s still only ""19 percent."" First, let’s look at the 19 percent number. According to the World Bank, which cites data from the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the 19 percent figure is right on for 2015. The U.S. figure has remained at 19 percent in the most recent Inter-Parliamentary Union data, which is current through June 2016. Specifically, in 2016, there are 104 women serving in both chambers of Congress, comprising 19.4 percent of the 535 combined members. (In all, 76 are Democrats and 28 are Republicans.)  Chamber by chamber, 20 women serve in the Senate, accounting for 20 percent of all members in the chamber, and 84 women serve in the House, accounting for 19.3 percent. Is 19 percent the highest in United States history? As it turns out, Kaine is correct on that point, too, as the following chart from the Congressional Research Service shows.  ""It's pretty straightforward,"" said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University’s Eagleton Institute of Politics. ""It's a record high, but it's quite low."" If anything, Kaine underplayed the United States’ deficit compared to the rest of the world. The U.S. rank has bounced around a bit over the past year, but it places 96th in the most recent Inter-Parliamentary Union rankings, among 191 countries for which there is data. That’s even worse than the 75th-place finish Kaine cited. By comparison, the other countries Kaine mentioned did better, though hardly close to male-female parity. Iraq had 27 percent female legislators (58th in the most recent rankings), Afghanistan had 29 percent (ranking 50th) and Rwanda was indeed No. 1 in the world with 64 percent. Our ruling Kaine said, ""In Congress right now, we're doing the best job we have ever done in women in the federal legislature,"" but it’s still only ""19 percent."" He’s right that the current figure for the United States is 19 percent, and he’s right that that’s a record high.

"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Donald Trump']","
Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton wants to let criminal undocumented immigrants stay in U.S.
","Donald Trump’s first TV ad of the general election depicts Hillary Clinton’s immigration plan as dangerous for America. ""In Hillary Clinton’s America, the system stays rigged against Americans. Syrian refugees flood in. Illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay,"" states the ad. ""Collecting Social Security benefits, skipping the line. Our border open. It’s more of the same, but worse. Donald Trump’s America is secure. Terrorists and dangerous criminals: kept out. The border: secured. Our families: safe. Change that makes America safe again."" The narration is accompanied by sinister music and footage of men being apprehended by border agents while other shadowy men walk freely on public streets. We have previously fact-checked Trump’s claim that Clinton wants ""totally open borders"" and ruled that False. He is correct that she wants to allow more Syrian refugees in the United States. This fact-check will focus on whether Clinton supports allowing illegal immigrants convicted of crimes to stay in the country. There is some truth to his claim, but Trump’s scary ad omits an important part of the story. Clinton’s immigration plan: Deport violent criminals Clinton has not vowed to deport every undocumented immigrant convicted of a crime. But the ad creates a misleading impression that she will let every criminal stay, regardless of the crime. Clinton has repeatedly called for focusing deportations on violent criminals. Clinton campaign spokesman Joshua Schwerin pointed to Clinton’s comments about her deportation priorities in a March debate in Miami, the National Immigrant Integration Conference and on her website. When pressed to explain her position during the debate, Clinton said she wants to limit deportations to ""violent criminals, terrorists, and anyone who threatens our safety."" Clinton has proposed being more lenient than Obama: ""So I do not have the same policy as the current administration does. I think it's important that we move to our comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, stop the raids, stop the round-ups, stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives, doing their jobs, and that's my priority."" She said violent criminals and those who plan terrorist attacks or threaten us are ""a relatively small universe."" We asked for more details about the types of crimes that would be included on her deportation list and did not get a reply from the campaign. But it’s fair to read into her statements that some criminals who committed lower-level crimes would be allowed to stay. That approach is similar to the current policy under the Obama administration. In 2014, a memo from the Homeland Security Department stated that the government would focus first on threats to national security, border security and public safety, including those involved or suspected of terrorism or felons. The second level of priority was for undocumented immigrants convicted of three or more misdemeanors (not including minor traffic offenses). That policy means that an estimated 87 percent of the undocumented population is not a priority for enforcement, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that examines immigration trends. ""We do not know enough details about Mrs. Clinton’s plans to characterize who would get to stay or would be a priority for removal,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokeswoman for the institute. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said it’s clear that Clinton favors legalization for many undocumented immigrants but not for violent offenders. ""Looking at Hillary’s statements, it’s clear that Trump’s ad is misleading,"" he said. ""Many, but not all, unlawful immigrants committed criminal offenses, but they are usually not violent or property crimes. Instead those were crimes in the immigration statutes."" The Trump campaign provided PolitiFact with information related to additional positions Clinton has taken that relate to undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes: 2013 immigration bill: Clinton supported the immigration bill that passed the Senate but never reached a vote in the House. The bill said that undocumented immigrants could apply for Registered Provisional Immigrant (RPI) status, which allowed them to stay in the country if they met certain criteria including that they had not been convicted of a felony or three or more misdemeanors. This fits in with Clinton’s plan to focus on violent criminals. Sanctuary cities: These policies generally refer to places where local law enforcement officers aren’t required to alert federal authorities to residents who may be in the country illegally. During her first race for president, Clinton said she would not crack down on sanctuary cities and argued that without such policies, people will hide from police and not report crimes. But Clinton doesn’t appear to want sanctuary cities to protect suspected murderers. In 2015, Clinton criticized the city of San Francisco for releasing a man from jail who later was charged with murdering a woman and had previously been deported many times. However, her campaign reiterated Clinton’s view that she believes sanctuary cities can help further public safety. Trump’s campaign also noted that thousands of undocumented immigrants who have been ordered removed and have criminal convictions remain in the country under Obama. We don’t know how the pace of criminal removals would differ under Clinton if she were elected. But the fact that Clinton has criticized the Obama administration for deportation has raised concerns among those who want to see stricter enforcement. ""She has promised to expand upon Obama’s immigration policies,"" said David Ray, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which promotes more restrictive immigration laws. Our ruling Trump says ""In Hillary Clinton’s America ... illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay."" The tone of the ad is to scare voters into thinking that Clinton would welcome convicted criminals to remain in the country illegally, and that’s an exaggeration. Clinton has said that she will deport ""violent criminals"" as well as anyone who threatens our safety. She hasn’t been more specific about the types of crimes that would or would not lead to deportation. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D03C40>],/factchecks/2016/aug/22/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-wants-let-crimin/
"['Trade', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pat Toomey']","
Pat Toomey’s shifting stance on the Trans-Pacific Partnership
","Sen. Pat Toomey has historically been one of the most pro-trade lawmakers in the Senate. The Pennsylvania Republican -- now in the political fight of his life in an attempt to keep his seat -- even wrote a book in 2009 called The Road to Prosperity, which touted the benefits of free trade. But last week, Toomey penned an op-ed that appeared in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette denouncing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal being spearheaded by the Obama administration, writing ""we should not pass a flawed deal just to get a deal done."" He continued: ""We should dump the TPP and return to the negotiating table to get an agreement that would create jobs and economic growth here at home."" Coming from Toomey, this stance was surprising, largely because the senator last year voted for and applauded the Trade Promotion Authority that was largely branded as a way for Washington to fast-track the TPP. So did Toomey flip-flop his stance on the TPP, especially as public support for the deal fades? We’re not making a judgement call on the policy itself, but let’s look at the facts of whether or not Toomey changed his stance. The TPP would be one of the largest regional trade deals in history. It involves the United States and 11 other countries -- including Japan, Australia, Mexico and Singapore -- on the Pacific rim that represent a third of worldwide trade, and has been seen as an effort by the Obama administration to lessen China’s influence in the region. But the deal has left both parties split, as some consider the effort to be one that will kill jobs in the United States and encourage foreign outsourcing. Former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders greatly opposed the deal, as has Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who once supported the TPP as secretary of state, came out against it as a presidential candidate, and PolitiFact rated it a Full Flop. Toomey’s spokeswoman E.R. Anderson says Toomey never made a decision on his support for the TPP. Meanwhile, his opponent Democrat Katie McGinty has been launching public attacks on Toomey over the last week, claiming his stance on TPP is a 180 compared to what he said before. ""Pat Toomey has spent his entire career pushing bad trade deals and policies that ship Americans jobs overseas, so nobody is buying this ridiculous flip flop,"" McGinty said in a statement. Her campaign has pointed out that in 2015, Toomey voted in favor of the Trade Promotion Authority, or the TPA, which was known as the ""fast-track"" bill. That legislation was basically a procedural vote in Congress that would make it easier for a final trade deal to pass because it requires lawmakers give a final trade deal an up or down vote without making any amendments. The Obama administration said this was a critical step in the process of negotiating with the other countries involved in the TPP. Before the TPA was passed, Toomey appeared on ""Morning Joe"" on MSNBC and urged support for the bill’s passage, saying ""this trade agreement is going to knock down barriers to allow us to export more manufactured goods from Pennsylvania."" The interview was branded as being about the TPA. But interviewer Joe Scarborough asked Toomey about ""the trade deal."" Toomey went on to discuss ""countries that we’re dealing with,"" implying he was talking about the TPP -- not the TPA, which was a congressional procedural amendment. ""This helps to encourage economic growth in the United States, job creation in Pennsylvania and the United States, and importantly Joe, you know these countries that we’re dealing with, they’re changing, they’re evolving some of them are rapidly developing,"" Toomey said during the interview. ""They’re either going to do that under the influence of the Chinese, who are very aggressively trying to insert themselves, or they’re going to do it with us."" MSNBC showed a graphic of countries involved with the TPP, and Scarborough asked Toomey, ""Isn’t this one more step in a globalization process that has gutted manufacturing not only in Pennsylvania, but across America?"" Toomey, responded ""no"" and said, ""we’ve got an opportunity with this trade agreement to knock down some of the barriers that keep our products out, so I think this is going to be very constructive."" At no point during the interview did Toomey say he was waiting to reserve judgement on the substance of the TPP, unlike other senators who voted in favor of the TPA. Democrat Sen. Tim Kaine, now Clinton’s running mate, also voted in favor of the TPA, but was explicit at the time in saying he would not vote in favor of the TPP once negotiations were finalized if it didn’t include certain assurances. Kaine has since come out against the TPP. When the TPA was passed, Toomey’s office put out a press release reading: ""Today, we are a big step closer toward creating more jobs, lifting wages, and boosting economic growth for Pennsylvania."" The statement continued: ""In fact, at a Senate Finance Committee hearing in April senior administration officials assured me that if the 11-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement is enacted, our state would likely see a further surge in exports."" Again, Toomey didn’t express that he waiting on negotiations to conclude before he made an endorsement of the TPP itself. Now, Anderson says that was simply an approval of the TPA and an expression of optimism that a final TPP deal would ""be good for Pennsylvania."" ""He’s not saying anything is a direct correlation,"" Anderson said. ""He’s saying this process will lead to negotiations that lead to a better result, and the result is not to his liking."" Joshua P. Meltzer, a senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development department at the Brookings Institute, told PolitiFact that though the TPP could likely not have been completed without the TPA, the TPA was not created solely for the passage of the TPP. For instance, he said, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the Trade in Services Agreement could also be passed under TPA if finished in time. ""The debate around TPA, while certainly influenced by the expected completion of TPP,"" he said, ""was more general in nature and focused on the impacts of trade more broadly than the specific benefits of TPP."" Toomey wrote in the Post-Gazette op-ed that his biggest problems with the TPP are that one, he believes there aren’t enough intellectual property protections for innovations in the life science and pharmaceutical sectors, and two, he says the TPP falls short in its protections for dairy farms in Pennsylvania who largely depend on exports. However, during that 2015 MSNBC interview, Toomey told Scarborough: ""It's definitely going to increase our ability to sell agricultural products overseas. It's going to help to protect the intellectual property of some of our really terrifically dynamic companies like pharmaceuticals and medical device companies."" McGinty has been against the TPP, but did support the North American Free Trade Agreement 20 years ago while working in the White House’ Office of Environmental Policy under former President Bill Clinton. Our Ruling Pat Toomey wrote in an op-ed this week that he’s against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, though he voted in favor of a bill in 2015 that fast-tracked its passage. While experts say voting in favor of the Trade Promotion Authority legislation wasn’t necessarily a symbolic vote of confidence in the TPP, the final outcome was that the TPP couldn’t have happened without it. In addition, Toomey -- who has been largely pro-trade in the past -- was interviewed on MSNBC last year and supported a trade deal, not just the TPA, which was a procedural vote in Congress. Asked multiple times during the interview, Toomey touted the benefits of a trade deal and didn’t temper his feelings by saying he’d reserve judgement on the TPP until negotiations wrapped up. He only says now, while he’s up for re-election, that he wanted to wait to decide on whether or not he supported TPP.

"['Transparency', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'Tim Kaine']","
Tim Kaine wrongly says Richard Nixon released tax returns during campaign
","Tim Kaine has been goading Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to release his tax returns to the public, just as the Democratic ticket did recently. Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia and the Democratic vice presidential nominee, said Trump’s refusal to release his forms is a break from past GOP nominees, including one who Kaine said was not known for his ethics. ""Even Richard Nixon released his tax returns to the public when he was running for president because he said, as has every major party nominee of both parties since, the American public have a right to see my tax returns,"" Kaine told a crowd during a Manchester, N.H., rally on Aug. 13. We weren’t aware that Nixon released his tax returns while he was on the campaign trail. So we asked the Hillary Clinton campaign where Kaine got the information for that statement. Sarah Peck, the Virginia director of communications for the Clinton campaign, pointed us to news articles and other sources about Nixon’s tax disclosures. We also looked at the website for the Presidential Tax History Project, which is run by Tax Analysts, a Falls Church-based nonprofit that specializes in tax issues. That group has compiled tax returns online for past presidents and major-party presidential nominees. On the group’s website, you’ll find copies of Nixon’s tax returns from 1969 through 1972. But there’s a catch. Those returns were not released while Nixon was running for president. They were released in December 1973, a year after he was re-elected. At the time, the 37th president was embroiled in the Watergate scandal, and questions were being raised about whether something also was amiss with his tax filings. Reports had surfaced that Nixon had been paying a small amount of federal tax for several years, a function of having secured a large deduction for donating his vice presidential papers to the National Archives, said Joseph J. Thorndike, a historian at Tax Analysts. To quell lingering concerns, Nixon released tax returns to the public as well as to the Joint Committee on Taxation despite the fact that the president was under an IRS audit at the time, Thorndike told us. So Nixon did indeed release his full tax returns as president. Did he ever do that while he was running for that office? Nixon ran for president three times, so let’s go back a bit further in history. Peck pointed us to a 1984 story in The New York Times, which noted that in his successful 1968 campaign for the presidency, Nixon released a brief summary of his financial affairs. In the 1968 nominating contest, Nixon faced a field of GOP candidates that included Michigan Gov. George Romney. Romney, whose son Mitt was the GOP presidential nominee in 2012, released a dozen years of his tax returns to Look magazine, according to a Bloomberg column written by Stephen Mihm, an associate professor of history at the University of Georgia. ""Look (magazine) then went to Nixon, who proved distinctly less forthcoming. He permitted a writer to inspect photocopies of his returns, but only three years’ worth,"" Mihm wrote. The history professor added that the issue didn’t come up during the general election campaign, because Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey also refused to release his tax returns. Mihm told us that Look magazine merely summarized selected information from Nixon’s returns, rather than publishing the documents themselves. ""I suppose one could argue that Nixon gave a journalist access to his returns, but that’s not the same thing as releasing them,"" Mihm wrote in an email. Thorndike also told us that Nixon’s limited disclosure in that instance wouldn’t really count as the candidate releasing his tax returns to the public. A reporter was able to look at them but wasn’t allowed to keep a copy of them, Thorndike noted. ""In my book, that would not count as releasing your tax returns, because the whole crowd source thing is a big part of it,"" Thorndike said. We couldn’t find any record of Nixon releasing tax returns during his two other runs for the presidency - in 1960, against John F. Kennedy, or in his 1972 re-election bid against George McGovern. Thorndike said that, to his knowledge, Nixon didn’t release his returns during those campaigns. Mihm also told us he’s not aware of Nixon releasing his tax returns during any of his presidential campaigns. Still, Thorndike said Nixon’s presidential tax return disclosure, while he was president in 1973, did start a tradition where presidents and candidates seeking the highest office release their returns to the public. Nixon’s successor, Gerald Ford, did not release his tax returns publicly but instead provided a summary of his taxes. But Jimmy Carter did publicly release his tax returns while running against Ford in 1976. In fact, every major-party nominee since Carter has released them to the public, Thorndike said. Our ruling Kaine said, ""Even Richard Nixon released his tax returns to the public when he was running for president ..."" Nixon never released his tax returns during a presidential campaign. But there is a kernel of truth in Kaine’s statement. Nixon released his full returns when he already was president, to quell controversy over his taxes.

AP's Julie Pace: Neither Trump nor Clinton has plan to address Syrian civil war
","Viral footage of a stunned 5-year-old boy covered in blood and debris from an airstrike in Aleppo have refocused the world’s attention on the Syrian civil war. Five years in, the bloody conflict has left an estimated 470,000 dead, including the older brother of Omran Daqneesh, Ali. But Syria has been a blip in the U.S. presidential election, with both major party nominees more focused on fighting ISIS. Americans don’t know what Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton would do to respond to Syria’s civil war, less than three months from Election Day, said Julie Pace, chief White House correspondent for the Associated Press. ""If you are a voter in this election and you look at that picture of that little boy and you feel sick to your stomach, like most of us do, you should look at your presidential candidates and demand a plan,"" Pace said Aug. 21 Fox News Sunday. ""Neither Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump have a plan for addressing the civil war in Syria."" Is it true that Clinton and Trump have yet to detail how they would tackle the war as commander in chief? For the most part, yes. As Pace said, Clinton and Trump have almost entirely focused on stopping ISIS, with little attention paid to the other crisis in Syria. How Syria fell into civil war Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, agreed with Pace that neither candidate has really tackled the civil war issue. ""In fairness to them,"" he said, ""it’s really difficult to address. The Obama administration has been tied in knots by it."" The crisis in Syria involves myriad actors, confusing alliances and conflicting motives. According to the United Nations, no side’s hands are clean of war crimes including murder, torture and rape. Investigators have also found evidence of President Bashar al-Assad and ISIS using chemical weapons against civilians. More than 250,000 have died in the past five years, with millions displaced from the country. The crisis, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, is only getting worse. The situation started in the mid 2000s when a severe drought in the country’s breadbasket created an internal mass migration of refugees into Syrian cities already crowded by Iraqi migrants displaced by the Iraq war. This exacerbated existing problems like unemployment, corruption and brewing discontent with the Assad regime. The unrest reached its boiling point during the Arab Spring of 2011, when pro-democracy protesters took to the streets and were met with a government crackdown. That summer, opposition groups began taking up arms, and war erupted. Religious divides and foreign power proxy wars make the conflict even more complicated. Most of the rebels are Sunni Muslim, backed by Sunni countries, like Turkey and Saudi Arabia, while Assad’s security forces belong to the minority Alawite sect, aided by Shia regimes like Iran and Iraq, as well as Russia. In the early days of the war, the Obama administration (with Clinton as secretary of state) focused on overthrowing Assad and supported moderate rebel groups. But the United States’ priorities have shifted to airstrikes on ISIS targets. With that move, the United States has given Russia ""freedom of action in backing Assad while the United States focuses on ISIS — choices that also empower Iran and raise critical questions about who will really win in Syria if the United States does defeat ISIS,"" Anthony Cordesman, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a working paper. Where Clinton and Trump stand The record largely backs Pace’s claim that Clinton and Trump have yet to propose a comprehensive plan on how they would address the Syrian civil war. Clinton has given a few more specifics than Trump, whose campaign did not respond to us by deadline.   Both candidates talked about the war at large in fall 2015, when Russia began bombing anti-Assad rebels. In an interview, Trump said he wanted to ""sit back and ... see what happens."" Clinton, breaking with the Obama administration, advocated for a no-fly zone, in which unauthorized aircraft are prohibited from entering the zone. Since then, Trump has said little regarding the civil war, keeping his focus on ISIS without a lot of specifics to preserve the element of surprise. When Trump does mention Syria, it’s to bolster his criticism of Clinton and Obama’s foreign policy or his proposal to ban Muslim immigrants and refugees. In recent months, Trump has repeatedly argued for working with Russia to ""knock the hell out of ISIS."" This position is more or less aligned with the current policy of learning to live with Assad, Gartenstein-Ross said. Trump has also called for safe zones, to be paid for by the Gulf States.""  Clinton has been more specific than Trump regarding the conflict at large. Here’s what she’s proposed as a presidential candidate: • A no-fly zone ""that will stop Assad from slaughtering civilians,"" • Creating safe havens for civilians, • More support for opposition forces, • Removing Assad through diplomacy, • Stopping the ""ongoing bombing that Russia has carried out in support of the Assad regime against the Syrians."" Both Pace and Gartenstein-Ross said Clinton’s varied ideas don’t amount to a full vision for ending the war. ""It’s a recipe for escalating the conflict without resolving the civil war,"" he told us. ""It’s unclear to me what the end game is and what the solution is."" Neither candidate has said what should happen as a result of a piecemeal approach: Is the goal of a no-fly zone to help opposition groups oust Assad? Pace asked. Similarly, is the goal of working with the Russians on airstrikes to prop up Assad? The United States’ narrow strategy in Syria may be self-defeating in the end, according to Cordesman. Even if ISIS is defeated, any new government will be ""hopelessly unstable"" given all the ethnic and religious divisions and foreign involvement.   ""Both candidates may choose to continue to address these issues in silence, but there is even less doubt than in the case of Iraq as to what the real legacy of the Obama administration is likely to be by the spring of 2017,"" Cordesman wrote. ""The transition plan seems to consist of a poison chalice."" Pace acknowledged that the Syrian crisis ""is one of the world’s most difficult problems,"" but said if the humanitarian crisis really matters to voters, they should make that known for this election and demand more clarity from the candidates. ""One of them will inherit this problem,"" she said. Our ruling Pace said, ""Neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump have a plan for addressing the civil war in Syria."" This is largely accurate. Clinton has called for a no-fly zone and safe zones in Syria to give civilians reprieve from war and continues to advocate for the ousting of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Her plans for Syria are considerably less detailed than her proposals for many other issues on her website. Trump says he wants to build safe zones and to work with the Russians, who are backing Assad. These proposals are ideas and not comprehensive plans for ending the civil war.  We rate Pace's claim Mostly True. Editor's note: The original version of this fact-check contained an inaccurate reference about Russia and the Assad regime. The article has been corrected to reflect Russia's support of Assad.​ This fact-check has also been updated with an additional proposal on Syria from Trump.  https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3d104f9e-2dd7-41d8-8af2-1ab86d7d0a8d",[<zip object at 0x00000280973084C0>],/factchecks/2016/aug/21/julie-pace/aps-pace-neither-trump-nor-clinton-has-plan-addres/
"['Debt', 'Virginia', 'Scott Rigell']","
Rep. Scott Rigell: 33.1 billion Rio Olympic gold medals would pay off U.S. national debt
","U.S. Rep. Scott Rigell says paying off the national debt would require an Olympic feat. ""Here’s something to think about while rooting on our U.S. Olympians: At $587 apiece, USA would need to bring home about 33.1 BILLION gold medals to pay off our national debt,"" Rigell, R-2nd, says on his congressional Facebook page. We asked Rigell’s office where he got the figures for his claim that billions of medals would be needed to erase the U.S. debt. Kaylin Minton, Rigell’s director of communications, pointed us to a July 31 article from CNN that said the value of the gold medal is $587. We found another estimate from Forbes magazine that said the value of the medal was $564. These figures are based on the value of the precious metal used in the top Olympic award. The medals weigh 500 grams - or just more than 1 pound. If that roughly $600 value for a pound of gold seems exceedingly low, there’s a good reason: The gold medal is made mostly of silver. Brazil’s federal government website dedicated to the games says the Rio 2016 top medal consists of 494 grams of sterling silver. The remaining 6 grams is made up of 99.9 percent pure gold. The value of a gold medal fluctuates based on the price of precious metals, which change daily. We looked at commodity prices about a week after Rigell’s statement and found the value of the precious metals was closer to $550. But the bottom line is, Rigell’s estimate of the value of a gold medal is about right for the basic smelt value. The figure does not include the $25,000 cash bonus the U.S. Olympic Committee provides to athletes for each gold medal won. It’s also worth noting that if Olympic medals are sold at auction, they could fetch a price well beyond their scrap value. Money magazine recently looked at some past gold medals that have been sold and fetched big bucks. A 1936 gold medal won by track and field star Jesse Owens sold for $1.47 million in 2013, according to the magazine. Another gold medal from an anonymous winner from the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles sold this year for $41,807. Holthouse, Carlin, Van Tright LLP, a Los Angeles-based accounting firm, said in a recent post on its website that gold medals on the open market generally fetch around $10,000. The ""intrinsic monetary worth"" of a gold medal - the amount an athlete would report on taxes - is based on the weight of the precious metals, or about $600, the accounting firm said. So how would that translate into paying off the national debt? Minton points to the national debt figures from the U.S. Treasury Department, which lists total national debt of $19.4 trillion. If you divide that by $587, it would translate into nearly 33.1 billion gold medals. One final point: The overall debt figure that Minton cites includes all debt, including about $5.4 trillion in intergovernmental debt that the U.S. government owes itself, such as Social Security and Medicare trust funds that are invested in Treasury securities. When looking at the size of the U.S. debt, some experts prefer tallying just the amount of debt held by the public in Treasury bills, savings bonds and obligations to foreign governments, because that’s the debt the U.S. government owes to outside entities. The publicly held debt comes to $14 trillion. If you were to divide that by the $587 medal value, that would mean it would take about 23.9 billion medals to equal the value of the U.S. debt held by the public. That’s not as high as Rigell says, but it’s still a massive number. Our ruling Rigell stated, ""At $587 apiece, USA would need to bring home about 33.1 BILLION gold medals to pay off our national debt."" The value of the award shifts based on the fluctuating price of the precious metals it contains. That said, the basic value of the gold medal that Rigell cites is a reasonable estimate. And that $587 cost would translate into billions of medals being needed to equal the size of the total national debt. But his statement benefits from some clarity. If you were to take into account a higher payday that an athlete could get by selling their gold medal on the open market, that amount could go well beyond the basic precious metal value of the award. That, in turn, would lower drastically the amount of medals it would take to pay off the debt. We rate his statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/beb7e209-818a-40a7-a9ec-b19feb5c94e4",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C8E280>],/factchecks/2016/aug/19/scott-rigell/rep-scott-rigell-331-billion-rio-olympic-gold-meda/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Donald Trump']","
Trump says U.S. admits 100,000 ""permanent immigrants"" annually from Middle East
","Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump promises his administration would be tough on immigration. He would temporarily suspend immigration from regions with a ""history of exporting terrorism"" and call for ""extreme vetting"" of people who want to come to the United States, Trump said Aug. 15 in Youngstown, Ohio. He raised concerns over the amount of people already coming in. ""The size of current immigration flows are too large to perform adequate screening,"" Trump said. ""We admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year."" Trump's comment about the adequacy of the vetting system is an opinion. But we wanted to look at his concerns and separately fact-check whether the country is taking 100,000 ""permanent immigrants"" a year from the Middle East.  Trump’s campaign did not get back to us about his comment. But his prepared speech cites a November 2015 post from the House Homeland Security Committee. It lists comments about refugees from war-torn Syria said by national security officials, including directors of the FBI, CIA and National Counterterrorism Center. The quotes share similar themes: Officials don’t have all the intelligence they’d like to have on Syrians, there’s concern that terrorist organizations may try to sneak people in as refugees, and rigorous screening must be applied to those who want to come in. But the officials’ comments, which Trump’s campaign references in the speech footnotes, are specifically about Syrian refugees, a small fraction of immigrants. Trump’s comment on ""the size of current immigration flow"" is broad and followed by a reference to Middle East ""permanent"" immigrants. President Barack Obama’s administration plans to accept at least 10,000 Syrian refugees over the course of this fiscal year (Oct 1., 2015 to Sept. 30, 2016). So far, at least 8,000 have been admitted. FBI Director James Comey has been misinterpreted by some political candidates as saying we cannot vet refugees at all. Comey has also said that while it is harder to check Syrians compared to Iraqis, the vetting process has ""improved dramatically."" Refugees are admitted into the country after a process that usually takes one to two years. It includes interviews, medical checks and screening by agencies such as the FBI, National Counterterrorism Center and State Department. Syrians and other refugees from the Middle East are also subjected to iris scans. Immigration officials have defended the process and resources available. Hundreds of applicants, including Syrians, have been denied admission to the United States as a result of information found on databases, Leon Rodriguez, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director, said Aug. 5. Trump’s estimate for Middle Eastern immigrants is more broad than just Syria. Footnotes in Trump’s speech cite a Breitbart article (a conservative site whose leader Stephen Bannon recently stepped down, temporarily, to become Trump’s campaign CEO) that says ""from 2001 to 2013 the U.S. admitted more than 1.5 million lawful permanent residents from majority-Muslims nations."" The article doesn’t specify which countries of origin were considered. Many countries in the Middle East-North Africa region are ""heavily Muslim,"" but the region ""is home to only about 20 percent of the world’s Muslims,"" according to Pew Research Center. The Department of Homeland Security publishes an annual Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, which includes how many people during a fiscal year get lawful permanent residence. That number reflects newcomers as well people already in the country. In fiscal 2014, a total of 1,016,518 people were granted lawful permanent residency. About 47 percent were new arrivals, and 53 percent became permanent residents as an adjustment of status. By tallying numbers from 21 countries in the Middle East region and with importance to United States’ Middle East policy (such as Libya in north Africa), nearly 105,000 people were granted permanent residency in fiscal 2014. Between 2005 and 2014 (years provided in the 2014 yearbook), the annual average was 88,088. By stricter definitions of the Middle East region (leaving out places such as Turkey and Pakistan) in fiscal 2014, about 70,000 got lawful permanent residence. And an average of 61,477 between 2005 and 2014. So Trump’s estimate is a bit too high. Still, the current vetting process of immigrants ""can certainly be criticized as inadequate and overwhelmed,"" said Steven Camarota, director of research at Center for Immigration Studies, which favors stricter immigration. He gave two examples of vetting failures. There’s the case of Pakistani woman Tashfeen Malik, who along with her husband killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. last year. Rep. Bob Goodlatte , R-Va., has said immigration officials did not sufficiently vet Malik’s fiancee visa application. Also, Waad Ramadan Alwan, an Iraqi citizen living in Kentucky sentenced in 2013 to serve in federal prison for terrorist activities. Alwan migrated through a refugee program, exposing ""an alarming gap in the screening process,"" national security experts told NPR. Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School, said it’s always possible a national security threat could get through, but it is less likely now than before 2001. For the procedures to work, he said, the United States needs adequate personnel. Our ruling In a speech in Ohio, Trump said, ""We admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year."" By a broad measure of which countries are part of the Middle East, Trump is close to the number of new green card holders during fiscal 2014, though the average from 2005 to 2014 was 88,088. By stricter regional parameters, about 70,000 got green cards in fiscal year 2014.

'Medical-grade marijuana' won't get you high, cannabis amendment supporters say
","Medical marijuana has many uses, according to supporters of Florida’s Amendment 2, but getting high is not one of them. Kim McCray, outreach director for United for Care, said in an Aug. 11 South Florida Times op-ed that the well-known euphoric effects of cannabis aren’t an issue. ""What is also important to know is that although some debilitated patients may require higher levels of THC than others based on their specific medical condition, medical-grade marijuana alone, will not get that patient ‘high,’ no matter what level of THC, CBD or any other compound is found in the plant,"" McCray wrote. She pointed out that medical cannabis can not only be smoked, but be packaged as ointments, oils, pills and skin patches. It sounded peculiar to us to say that medical marijuana can’t get you high, regardless of the chemical content. We checked with some experts to clear the air. Doctor’s orders Florida voters will decide in November 2016 whether to allow medical marijuana in the state. The proposed constitutional amendment would allow patients with cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis ""or other debilitating medical conditions of the same kind or class as or comparable to those enumerated"" to obtain cannabis with a doctor’s recommendation. What the system would truly look like is still anyone’s guess, because the amendment leaves most of the details up to the state Legislature and state health department. Patients would get a state-registered ID card that would allow them to get their marijuana, but the how, when and where of it wouldn’t be decided until the amendment passes.   Also unknown is just what kind of ""medical-grade marijuana"" will be available. Amendment 2 doesn’t place restrictions on what forms of cannabis the state could allow, including cannabis in its smokable form. To understand the types of marijuana or marijuana products we’re talking about, we need a quick chemistry lesson. Cannabis contains roughly 500 compounds, 70 of which are psychoactive. THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is the main psychoactive ingredient in the marijuana plant. The level of THC in a plant varies based on the strain, the part of the plant used, and how it is processed for consumption. Also present is a substance called cannabidiol, known as CBD, which is an antioxidant and has properties that are thought to protect the brain. It’s also not psychoactive like THC.   Florida’s 2014 law approved low-THC cannabis oil or vapor products containing CBD for patients with muscle spasms, cancer, epilepsy and terminal illnesses. Fifteen other states have similar laws. Even the National Institute on Drug Abuse says CBD may prove useful in treating epilepsy as well as inflammation and mental illnesses or addictions. Products like cannabis oil are made from strains of marijuana already bred to be high in CBD and low in THC, although THC still is a part of the equation. Research shows that compound is what brings CBD into the brain. Now for how this applies to McCray’s statement. United for Care spokeswoman Bianca Garza said McCray meant to dispel the notion that medical marijuana patients obtain their medicine for the sole purpose of feeling its well-known euphoric effects. ""The point being made in the statement is that doctors and patients will decide on a care plan that will enable them to become more normal,"" Garza said in an email. ""In other words, they'll decide on a dosage appropriate for their debilitating condition to feel less pain, to have fewer seizures and spasms, etc. It will be decided by a Florida licensed physician and will not lead to patients being ‘high.’ "" Essentially, their argument is one of semantics: Medical marijuana patients won’t be getting stoned, they’ll be using medication under the supervision of a doctor as a form of treatment. That precludes the idea that patients will just be taking marijuana as a recreational drug, although Garza conceded that ""like any medicine, there’s the possibility for abuse."" United for Care’s point of view still doesn’t mean some forms of medical marijuana aren’t capable of getting patients baked. Marijuana still has physiological effects, whether it’s doctor-approved or not. Dr. David Casarett, a professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and author of the book Stoned: A Doctor's Case for Medical Marijuana, said that low-THC strains or oils that have only CBD don’t produce the same buzzed feeling as a joint. But higher-THC marijuana still ""will most certainly get you high,"" he said. ""Just calling something ‘medical grade’ won't prevent you from getting high,"" Casarett said. ""It's like alcohol. Laboratory grade ethanol will get you just as drunk as home-brewed moonshine with the same alcohol content."" Our ruling A representative of United for Care said, ""Medical-grade marijuana alone will not get that patient ‘high,’ no matter what level of THC, CBD or any other compound is found in the plant."" The group said McKay is referring to the controlled conditions under which medical marijuana would be monitored by doctors for use by patients. But her word choice could easily lead to misunderstanding. While there are non-euphoric strains of cannabis that are already being used as treatments for some conditions, it’s not accurate to say that no form of medical marijuana will get you high. High-THC medical cannabis will still produce the same intoxicating effects as the street form of the drug will.

Do Milwaukee police use deadly force at one of the lowest rates in the country?
","The day after a sniper killed five Dallas police officers, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn held a news conference to share his reaction and to comment on policing in his city. He made an important claim that would become even more significant in the weeks to come. The chief stated: ""We stand ready to be judged by the standards of our own training, our own selection criteria, our own highly limited use of deadly force -- among the lowest rates in the country -- as well as the remarkable examples, time after time, when police officers in this city are justified in the use of deadly force, but do not use it."" Flynn made the statement on July 8, 2016. Five weeks later, on Aug. 13, one of his officers fatally shot an armed man during a foot chase in an incident that touched off two days of violence that made national news. (It was the third such fatality in Milwaukee in 2016.) So, do Milwaukee police use deadly force at a rate that is among the lowest in the country? It’s a broad statement that is supported by national data for 2015. But there simply isn’t national data to compare cities for prior years. Data is limited To back the chief’s statement, a Milwaukee police spokesman directed us to a fatal police shootings database for 2015 created by the Washington Post. Criminologists regard it as the best current source of information on fatal shootings committed by police. But since 2015 is the only full year of data available, it is a ""snapshot of one year,"" University of Missouri-St. Louis criminologist David Klinger told us. Nationwide, according to the Post, there were 990 people shot and killed by police around the country in 2015 (as well as nearly 600 so far in 2016). A quick breakdown of the 2015 figures: Eleven of the 2015 fatal shootings occurred in Wisconsin, but just one in Milwaukee. Tyrone Ryerson Lawrence, a 45-year-old black man, was shot inside a home. He refused to drop a knife and an officer shot him, fearing that Lawrence would stab his wife, according to police. There’s no question that one is a low number -- particularly for a city with a population of 600,000. The bigger picture But Flynn made a general claim about Milwaukee having a low rate in the use of deadly force, not a claim about a single year. And numbers can vary relatively significantly in a given year. In 2013, for example, Milwaukee police fatally shot four people. We found that based on population, some cities had a much lower rate than Milwaukee that year: San Francisco police killed one person, while the number was three in Austin, Texas (which serves 842,000 people), San Jose, Calif. (982,000), and Las Vegas (nearly 1.5 million). To be sure, the raw numbers haven’t ranged widely in Milwaukee -- 2012 -- 1; 2013 -- 4; 2014 -- 2; 2015 -- 1. But without national figures for anything but 2015, we don’t know how Milwaukee’s rate compares. Our rating Flynn said Milwaukee police use deadly force at a rate that is ""among the lowest"" in the country. Flynn bases his claim on the best data currently available, which show Milwaukee police killed one person in 2015. But 2015 is the only full year for which data are available on a national level; we simply don’t know how Milwaukee’s rate would compare in prior years. Our definition of Half True is a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important information. That fits here.

Sarah Palin claims Arizona congressional candidate is a big government ‘champion’
","Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin expressed her discontent for Republicans in name only, or RINOs, while talking about Arizona’s District 4 congressional race. The Aug. 30 Republican primary is a two-man contest between three-term incumbent U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar of Prescott and challenger Ray Strauss of Buckeye, whom Palin called a ""malleable politician"" willing to compromise. ""In other words, to sell us out, raise taxes, and spend more of your hard-earned money,"" Palin said in an Aug. 11 Facebook post supporting Gosar. ""Dr. Gosar's opponent is actually classified by Americans for Prosperity for being a ‘Champion of Big Government' for his votes to raise taxes while on the local city council."" Palin was referring to Strauss, who served on the Buckeye City Council from June 2010 through May 2016. We wondered whether Palin’s claims against Gosar’s opponent held any weight. Not for taxes We did not hear back from Palin or Strauss, but Gosar campaign spokesman Tom Van Flein pointed us to the Americans for Prosperity's 2016 scorecard. This conservative group, which advocates for limited government, annually grades local and state politicians based on their fiscal voting record. Their scale ranges from Hero of the Taxpayer to Hero of Big Government:  According to his most recent scorecard for calendar year 2015, AFP did give Strauss a grade of ""Champion of Big Government."" But that doesn’t tell the whole story. In June 2015, the Buckeye City Council unanimously approved a $258 million budget for fiscal year 2015-16, $73 million more than the previous fiscal year. ""The (sic) rating in calendar year 2015 was for voting for a 39 percent increase in the city’s approved budget, from $185 million in fiscal year 2015 to $258 million in fiscal year 2016,"" Americans for Prosperity Arizona state director Tom Jenney said. However, Strauss -- and the rest of the council -- did not vote to increase taxes. They actually approved a lower property tax rate of $1,800 per $100,000 of accessed property value. Despite a lower tax rate, some homeowners may still pay more in taxes if their home is worth more, but it varies. ""It’s the assessed value on any given property that dictates whether someone’s overall taxes increase or decrease,"" said Buckeye finance director Larry Price. ""She got her years wrong or just flat out missed it."" Moreover, while Strauss did get a ""Champion of Big Government"" rating for calendar year 2015, from calendar year 2007 through calendar year 2015, he averaged a score of -1, or ""Needs Much Improvement."" And in calendar year 2014, AFP actually gave him a ""Friend of the Taxpayer"" rating. We also examined the minutes for all the Buckeye City Council meetings in 2015 and found that Strauss voted against resolutions thought to be pro-government. In August 2015, he voted against two resolutions for city employee raises, including one that would give raises to employees based on the city’s financial scope. By comparison, Gosar received a perfect score from AFP, as his congressional votes coincided with the group’s position. Our ruling Palin said, ""Dr. Gosar's opponent is actually classified by Americans for Prosperity for being a ‘Champion of Big Government' for his votes to raise taxes while on the local city council."" That’s misleading and leaves out important context. The opponent in question, Ray Strauss, did not vote to raise taxes that year while on the Buckeye City Council. And while the group did give him that rating in 2015, it wasn't a lifetime rating. Palin cherry-picks one year. On average, he has a much more moderate score from AFP.

Donald Trump off in saying Hillary Clinton wants illegal immigrants to take U.S. jobs
","On a campaign visit to West Bend, Wis., on Aug. 16, 2016, Donald Trump hit one of his favorite topics -- immigration -- and one of his favorite targets -- Hillary Clinton. Trump tried to reach out to African-American voters with various attacks on Clinton, including this one: ""Now she's proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants to come in and take everybody's jobs, including low-income African-Americans."" Trump’s reference, however, is to advanced-degree international students who are legally in the United States -- and who are trained for top jobs in technology and science. Trump’s evidence To back Trump’s claim, his campaign pointed to this statement from the technology policy part of Clinton's campaign website: Our immigration system is plagued by visa backlogs and other barriers that prevent high-skilled workers and entrepreneurs from coming to, staying in, and creating jobs in America. Far too often, we require talented persons from other countries who are trained in U.S. universities to return home, rather than stay in here and continue to contribute to our economy. As part of a comprehensive immigration solution, Hillary would ""staple"" a green card to STEM masters and PhDs from accredited institutions—enabling international students who complete degrees in these fields to move to green card status. STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. The Trump campaign also cited a Breitbart.com article published June 28, 2016, the day Clinton released the plan. The ""staple"" proposal would mean, the conservative site claimed, ""university-trained foreign labor will drown the lifetime wages and career prospects of her college-indebted American supporters."" Even that criticism refers to jobs sought by college graduates, not jobs held by people with low incomes. Other views Paula Dwyer, an economics columnist for Bloomberg, explained in a column that the automatic green card Clinton proposes would grant foreign graduates permanent U.S. residence and work visas. Dwyer noted that such proposals have had bipartisan support while also raising some concerns -- though not the type Trump raised. She wrote: President Barack Obama suggested the stapled green card in his first term, as did Mitt Romney in his 2012 presidential campaign. Silicon Valley executives have long advocated it to address what they claim is a shortage of qualified high-tech workers …. Clinton says it makes no sense for the U.S. to invest in the education of some of the world's smartest people, only to send them back to India, China and other countries to start companies and compete against the U.S. But critics of the influx of foreign students to the U.S. warn that, without safeguards, the policy would turn U.S. colleges into green-card factories that crowd out American students, drive down salaries and discourage U.S.-born students from STEM careers. So, there are some concerns about extending the stay of international students, who are not illegal immigrants but are studying in the U.S. on temporary visas. Regardless, these master’s and doctoral graduates in science, technology, engineering and math are not threats to jobs held by low-income workers. There’s also no evidence that Clinton’s proposal would apply to millions of people. The government’s latest quarterly report says 478,851 international students were studying in STEM fields at U.S. universities as of March 2016. And, of course, not all of them pursue advanced degrees or will want to remain in the U.S. after finishing their studies.     Our rating Trump says Clinton is ""proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants to come in and take everybody's jobs, including low-income African-Americans."" Clinton would ""staple"" green cards to the diplomas of foreign students in the United States who complete master’s or doctoral degrees in science, technology, engineering or math, extending their stay so that they could work in the U.S., particularly in high-tech jobs, after graduation rather than returning home. The green cards would be available to students who are already legally in the United States. And given their level of education and expertise, they would not be taking jobs of low-income Americans. Nor is the program aimed at millions of students. We rate the statement False.    https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/65130cee-8948-4fca-8a6d-bee84a8dcf41",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B37C40>],/factchecks/2016/aug/18/donald-trump/hillary-clinton-want-millions-illegal-immigrants-t/
"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Michele Bachmann']","
Michele Bachmann says ""PolitiFact came out and said that everything I said was true"" in last debate
","
During the Dec. 15, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Sioux City, Iowa, Rep. Michele Bachmann made a claim that jolted us out of our seats. 
""After the debates that we had last week, PolitiFact came out and said that everything that I said was true,"" she said. 
It came during an exchange between Bachmann, a Minnesota Republican, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Bachmann was attacking Gingrich’s work after he left Congress. He has said he was a paid consultant, but critics such as Bachmann contend he was really a lobbyist. 
Gingrich defended his work on behalf of the government-sponsored mortgage-bundling giant Freddie Mac, arguing that government does not necessarily taint whatever enterprise it touches. 
He added, ""I did no lobbying of any kind for any organization. That was a key part of every agreement we had."" 
Challenged by moderator Chris Wallace for hard evidence, Bachmann said that ""we know that (Gingrich)  cashed paychecks from Freddie Mac. That’s the best evidence that you can have. Over $1.6 million. … The speaker had his hand out and he was taking $1.6 million to influence senior Republicans to keep the scam going in Washington, D.C. That’s absolutely wrong. We can’t have as our nominee for the Republican party someone who continues to stand for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. They need to be shut down, not built up."" 
Gingrich responded, ""Well, the easiest answer is, that's just not true. What she just said is factually not true. I never lobbied under any circumstance. I never went in and suggested in any way that we do this. In fact, I tried to help defeat the housing act when the Democrats were in charge of the House. And if you go back and talk to former Congressman Rick Lazio, he'll tell you, when we were passing housing reform while I was speaker, I never at any time tried to slow down the reform effort. In fact, I helped him pass the reform bill. And I think some of those people ought to have facts before they make wild allegations."" 
At that point, Bachmann jumped back in. ""Well, after the debates that we had last week, PolitiFact came out and said that everything that I said was true. And the evidence is that Speaker Gingrich took $1.6 million. You don't need to be within the technical definition of being a lobbyist to still be influence-peddling with senior Republicans in Washington, D.C., to get them to do your bidding."" 
Wait... what? We said that ""everything"" Bachmann had said was true? 
Actually, that's not what we said. 
At the Dec. 10 debate she was referring to, PolitiFact checked two claims from Bachmann and rated them Mostly True and Pants on Fire. 
The fact-check she may have been referencing was, ""In 1993, Newt Gingrich ‘first advocated for the individual mandate in health care. And as recently as May of this year, he was still advocating’ for it."" We rated that one a Mostly True. 
But we also rated her claim that Mitt Romney, as governor of Massachusetts, ""put into place socialized medicine."" We found that was ridiculously false and rated it Pants on Fire. 
Her comment about our ratings was also a bit of a non-sequitur. Neither of the two items we checked addressed the subject at hand -- Gingrich’s work for Freddie Mac, what he thinks of Freddie Mac today, or whether Gingrich was ever a lobbyist. 
Maybe Bachmann was simply trying to burnish her image as a truth teller. However, using PolitiFact to back up that assertion is a bit unusual. Her PolitiFact report card shows 59 percent of her statements rated have earned either a False or Pants on Fire. She has earned five Trues, three Mostly Trues, six Half Trues, seven Mostly Falses, 19 Falses and 11 Pants on Fires. 
Our ruling 
During the Sioux City debate, Bachmann said that ""after the debate that we had last week, PolitiFact came out and said that everything I said was true."" That’s simply not the case. We rated two statements by Bachmann from that debate and ruled one of them Mostly True and the other one Pants on Fire. So for claiming she had a perfect record, she earns another Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A479300>],/factchecks/2011/dec/16/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-politifact-came-out-and-said/

San Antonio Democrat says nearly 160 million working families will see $1,000 tax hike if Congress does not renew payroll tax cut
","
Like many in Congress, U.S. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez of Texas says letting a payroll tax cut expire would be a bad move for families.

The San Antonio Democrat said in a Dec. 13, 2011, press release: ""If Congress does not pass the renewal of the payroll tax cut before the end of the year, nearly 160 million working families will see their taxes go up by roughly $1,000.""

That many families will face that much of a tax hit?

The payroll tax at issue is the 6.2 percent of eligible earnings that American workers pay to help fund Social Security. It’s called a payroll tax because the money is taken directly out of people’s paychecks. There are limits to the total amount that individuals are required to pay. In 2009 and 2010, the levy applied to the first $106,800 of salary, meaning no one would pay more than $6,621. Employers paid a matching share.

In December 2010, the employee tax was cut to 4.2 percent through 2011 as part of an agreement President Barack Obama worked out with Congress to extend income-tax reductions passed during President George W. Bush’s administration. Obama later proposed slicing the payroll levy to 3.1 percent for workers next year.

Congress has been debating how to extend and possibly expand the payroll tax cut.

Asked how Gonzalez settled on his figures, his office urged us to contact the Office of Management and Budget, which is part of the executive branch, and also pointed us to a November 2011 web post by the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, stating that the average annual benefit per household if Obama's proposed cut to 3.1 percent was adopted would be $1,426. A footnote attributes that information to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent research organization.

In an interview, Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the center, walked us through its estimates of the impact of renewing the current payroll tax cut through 2012.

Regarding the congressman’s reference to the tax cut benefiting ""nearly 160 million working families,"" the center estimates that the country will have 165 million households in 2012. However, it says, about 122 million households — not nearly 160 million — are projected to benefit from extending the cut. About 40 million households would not benefit, Williams told us, because the residents are not projected to have paying jobs.

The congressman, he said, ""has got the wrong number of benefiting households.""

Next, we took up the claim that working families will see their taxes go up by roughly $1,000 if the cut is not extended.

By the end of this year, according to another center calculation, nearly 121 million households will have taken home an average of $934 more thanks to the cut. And the center estimates that the average benefit, for all benefiting households, would be $920 in 2012.

Logically, the dollar value of each household’s projected 2012 tax savings is greatly driven by how much each household earns. If the payroll tax cut is extended, the center projects, the poorest 20 percent of households will average a $165 benefit. Higher-income households would accumulate more take-home dollars; households earning $62,043 to $104,401 are projected to average $1,280 in benefits and those earning $104,402 or more would average $2,253 in 2012 benefits.

Next, we asked the OMB about the $1,000 tax-cut figure. By email, spokeswoman Meg Reilly pointed out that according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the nation’s median household income in 2010 was $49,445, nearly $50,000 -- the 2-percent cut amounts to $1,000 of that total.

Summing up, the center’s Williams told us that extending the cut would benefit about 122 million households next year, saving them an average of a little over $900 apiece. ""The range will be large, though, going from virtually no savings for people who work very little to"" more than $2,200 for workers with the highest earnings, he said.

Our ruling

Gonzalez’s claim overstates the households that would benefit from extending the tax cut -- by about 40 million. Also, his warned-of $1,000 tax increase is based on an average; actual results for each working family would vary widely. We rate his statement Half True. 
UPDATE, Feb. 16, 2012: This article has been updated to clarify that the projection cited by the Center for American Progress applied to President Obama's unsuccessful proposal to reduce the payroll tax by 3.1 percent.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979E09C0>],/factchecks/2011/dec/15/charlie-gonzalez/san-antonio-democrat-says-failure-extend-payroll-t/

Blind spot? RNC says DNC chair Wasserman Schultz denied unemployment is up under Obama
","
Bloggers could not believe it. South Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, insisted on national television that unemployment did not increase under President Barack Obama. 
""Denial — it ain’t just a river in Egypt,"" wrote HotAir.com blogger Ed Morrissey. ""Appearing on Fox News this morning, DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz insisted that unemployment didn’t go up in Barack Obama’s term of office, a hilarious argument on several levels."" 
Morrissey blogged about a 4-minute interview between Wasserman Schultz and Gretchen Carlson, co-host of Fox and Friends, on Dec. 12, 2011. Their back-and-forth over unemployment inspired the Republican National Committee press team to package Morrissey's post with several other accounts in an e-mail blast to political reporters. 
""This morning Delusional Debbie denied unemployment went up under Obama -– a claim now gracing Drudge Report and a number of other news sites,"" the RNC e-mail read. ""Either Wasserman Schultz needs to study up (here are the stats for her: from BLS.gov: unemployment January ’09: 7.8 percent, unemployment November ’11: 8.6 percent), or she’s deliberately trying to deceive Americans."" 
We think the interview -- and what exactly Wasserman Schultz and Carlson said -- warrants another look. 
Here's a transcript of the exchange (distilled here in a 40-second video), which came on the heels of talk of GOP presidential candidates and Obama's understanding of the economy. 
Carlson: ""Unemployment has gone up precipitously since he (Obama) took office."" 
Wasserman Schultz: ""That is simply not true."" 
Carlson: ""Yes it is."" 
Wasserman Schultz: ""In fact, unemployment has now dropped below 9 percent. It's continuing to drop. He's been focused on..."" 
Carlson: ""But it's higher than when they promised that the stimulus would lower it to 8 percent ..."" 
Wasserman Schultz: ""See, that narrative doesn’t work for you anymore, though, because when President Obama…"" 
Carlson: ""It's not my narrative. I'm just talking about facts, where the unemployment numbers are."" 
Wasserman Schultz: ""You just said that the unemployment rate has been going up since he took office, and it hasn't."" 
Carlson: ""Is unemployment higher now than when President Obama took office?"" 
Wasserman Schultz: ""What’s happened since President Obama took office..."" 
Carlson: ""Is unemployment higher than he took office?"" 
Wasserman Schultz: ""Unemployment is nearing right around where it was when President Obama took office and it's dropping. You just said that it's been increasing, and that's not true."" 
A quick note about the back-and-forth. Carlson said ""they,"" meaning the White House, promised the stimulus would lower unemployment to 8 percent. We rated nearly identical claims from House Speaker John Boehner and U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann Mostly False. 
But for this fact-check, we're honing in on whether Wasserman Schultz denied that the unemployment rate has increased since Obama took office. 
There is no denying the rate is higher now (8.6 percent in November 2011) than it was in February 2009, Obama's first full month in office (8.2, which itself was up .4 percentage points from January 2009). Bloggers pointed to this and other workforce figures to emphasize the silliness of Wasserman Schultz's (supposed) insistence that unemployment is not up since Obama took office. ""Maybe the DNC should consider having a chair who has some connection to reality,"" Morrissey wrote. 
An analysis of the Fox interview shows the conversation didn't go down that way, though a quick look at Wasserman Schultz's quotes (i.e. ""That is simply not true"") may lead someone to believe it. 
The host and guest's back-and-forth is pretty muddy, stuffed with implications and ignored points. It's mostly confusing because Carlson and Wasserman Schultz refuse to share a frame of discussion. Carlson wants to talk about how unemployment is higher since Obama took office, but she uses a misleading word, precipitously, to start it off. Wasserman Schultz ignores Carlson's larger point and reacts instead to her interpretation of what Carlson said, that unemployment is rising. 
There are grains of truth. We consulted professional linguists and economists to help us find them. 
Carlson may have been trying to state the obvious -- that unemployment is up since Obama's first day -- when she segued into the unemployment discussion. Her use of ""precipitously,"" though, immediately changed the tone and put Wasserman Schultz on defense. The word could be a fair choice to describe the jump from the April 2008 unemployment rate of 4.9 percent, with President George W. Bush at the nation's helm, to the Obama-led October 2009 rate of 10.1. An increase of 5.2 percentage points in an 18-month span is indeed precipitous, said Gary Burtless, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. About half of that increase happened in Bush's tenure, though, he added. 
The word is not accurate if you interpret Carlson as saying unemployment is rising precipitously now, as Wasserman Schultz did and as most people would, said Alec Marantz, New York University linguistics and psychology professor. 
""If Carlson meant, 'Unemployment is significantly higher than when Obama took office,' what she said doesn't convey that,"" Marantz said. ""The use of the adverb 'precipitously' suggests a steady, steep upward slope, which corresponds only to the beginning of Obama's presidency, not to a period between 'since he took office' and now."" 
The jobless rate has tapered off since its October 2009 peak, lingering mainly within the range of 9.2 and 8.8 percent. The most recent rate available is 8.6 percent, its lowest point since March 2009. Wasserman Schultz wants viewers to consider the zigs and zags of unemployment data because they cast the administration's record in a more promising light. This explains why she immediately responds to Carlson with, ""That's simply not true."" She isn't denying unemployment has gone up, but that it has gone up ""precipitously."" 
Carlson tries to adjust her point so that it's about ""where the unemployment numbers are."" So she asks Wasserman Schultz, ""Is unemployment higher now than when President Obama took office?"" 
The answer is an unequivocal yes. 
But Wasserman Schultz does not offer a direct answer. Her response, ""Unemployment is nearing right around where it was when President Obama took office and it's dropping,"" implies the rate has increased but articulates that unemployment is going down. It's not a denial; it's a dodge. Wasserman Schultz sees Carlson's point but wants to shift to recent declining jobless numbers under Obama for political reasons. 
And to be clear, the national unemployment rate is ""nearing"" the January 2009 rate of 7.8 percent, and it's even closer if you take the February 2009 number, Burtless said. But it's not yet ""near,"" he said. 
Our ruling 
The enemy of clarity is cross-talk. The twists and implications in this conversation happen fast and are not explained to viewers, leaving some with the impression that Wasserman Schultz emphatically disagrees with the fact that there are more people without jobs today than in early 2009. The devil is usually in the details, however, and in this case, Carlson's start to the conversation did not express exactly that. 
Did Wasserman Schultz really insist that unemployment did not go up during Obama’s term, as claimed by bloggers and then propagated by the Republican National Committee? No. Wasserman Schultz insisted something else -- that it hadn't gone up precipitously and that it is not going up.  We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A45A340>],/factchecks/2011/dec/15/republican-national-committee-republican/did-dnc-chair-wasserman-schultz-deny-unemployment-/
"['Federal Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Ron Johnson']","
Sen. Ron Johnson says Obama has increased federal workforce by 10 percent amid national job losses
","
Continuing a trend that began under President George W. Bush after 9/11, the federal government workforce has grown under President Barack Obama, mostly in defense, homeland security and related agencies.

Wisconsin’s junior senator, Republican Ron Johnson, wants to roll back the Obama-era growth by 2015 by not filling positions as people leave or retire. He says it could save $248 billion over a decade.

That proposal is part of a $1.4 trillion deficit-cutting plan Johnson presented to the congressional ""supercommittee"" that haggled over a budget-balancing plan before it reached a stalemate.

In the wake of the failure, Johnson argued it shouldn’t be that hard to find savings, especially in the federal worker ranks.

""I’m not talking about firing or terminating anybody, but we’ve got about 400,000 workers ready to retire,"" Johnson said in a Nov. 17, 2011 appearance on Bloomberg television.

He added: ""President Obama has increased the federal workforce 192,000 individuals, about 10 percent since he’s taken office, while we’ve lost 2 million jobs.""

Were Johnson’s numbers on target?  

PolitiFact National has tested many jobs claims. Its gold standard for official jobs figures is the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, considered the official arbiter of U.S. employment numbers.

Checking those numbers, we found that it’s accurate that 2 million jobs were lost in the overall private and public sectors (local and state governments dropped considerably). We used a baseline of January 2009, the last partial month of President George W. Bush.

What about the federal workforce?

Using the same Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, we found a smaller jump in the federal workforce than Johnson claimed -- a 129,900 gain, or  6 percent -- from January 2009 to October 2011. That’s based on preliminary numbers posted as of late November.

Where did Johnson get his 192,000 jobs and 10 percent increase?

He pointed us to the official executive-branch jobs data kept on the FedScope website by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.

The June 2011 FedScope data on civilian jobs -- the latest available when Johnson spoke -- showed 2.137 million federal employees, excluding most of the judicial, legislative and postal jobs.

Johnson provided us data for December 2008 -- just before Obama took office -- that he said he obtained privately from the agency. It showed 1.945 million federal jobs. The agency declined to comment on Johnson’s data. An OPM official said the agency did not publicly put out FedScope data for that month.

The agency referred us to publicly available September 2008 data, a few months prior, which showed 1.938 million federal jobs.

Either starting point gets you to Johnson’s 10 percent increase, about 190,000 jobs added.

Another important note: On the federal government growth, most of the increase goes away if you include the U.S. Postal Service, which has shrunk significantly. When you do, the increase is 29,000.

PolitiFact has found that both presentations -- postal workers in, postal workers out -- are used and credible. But they measure different things.

Some researchers see the quasi-governmental Postal Service as separate; others say it’s still part of the federal government.

""If you ignore that fact and say ‘The federal government is growing strongly’ and leave unsaid ‘except the parts that are shrinking fast,’ aren’t you just misleading readers?"" asked Gary Burtless, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution.

What about Johnson’s data source, FedScope?

FedScope is considered reliable and is used by researchers who prefer an actual headcount to the sample-based approach used by BLS. So Johnson is in good company when citing FedScope, which his office views as more precise than the BLS for the federal workforce.

Johnson, though, mixes his data sources, and there are other problems with his numbers.

If he had stuck with BLS for both numbers, he would gotten a significantly smaller increase in federal jobs -- 6 percent instead of the 10 percent he cited.

Plus, the FedScope numbers are not adjusted for seasonal swings, while the BLS data is tweaked for that. It’s impossible to judge the impact of that, but the difference might be notable, based on our review of BLS seasonal and non-seasonal data.

In addition, Johnson’s time frame is off in a couple ways.

His start date of December 2008 is about a month shy of Bush’s final month. So his figures wrongly attribute a small chunk of federal government growth to Obama.

And while his data was the latest available on FedScope, it was not as current as BLS.

Our conclusion

Despite all that, we found, it’s clear Johnson is on target on the 2 million jobs lost overall, and accurate or very close on the federal workforce trend -- at least using FedScope.

But juxtaposing the two numbers invites an apples to oranges comparison because they are from two different data sources. FedScope is credible, but a different animal than the BLS figures, so a lot of clarification of differences is needed to explain the relationship between the two measurements.

If Johnson had used the more up-to-date and widely quoted Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers for both calculations, the federal growth trend would have been less dramatic, though still significant.

Finally, we’ll note that PolitiFact routinely checks not only the accuracy of jobs numbers, but whether blame or credit is justifiably fixed on the subject of the political claim. For job-creation and job-loss claims, we have noted in the past that politicians’ policies are just one factor in employment levels. That’s true in this case, though the first part of Johnson’s claim --  on federal government growth -- arguably relates in large part to policy decisions by Obama.

Bottom line: A generally accurate statement that leaves out some key details.

That fits our definition of Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097120880>],/factchecks/2011/dec/15/ron-johnson/sen-ron-johnson-says-obama-has-increased-federal-w/
"['New Jersey', 'Education', 'Julia Sass Rubin']","
Anti-voucher advocate claims proposed scholarship program would be funded out of public school budgets
","
Thousands of students could receive a private education through corporate donations to a so-called ""scholarship"" program, but one critic claims the proposed school voucher program would be funded on the backs of public schools.

Julia Sass Rubin, a spokeswoman for the anti-voucher group Save Our Schools NJ, explained the funding mechanism within the proposed legislation, known as the Opportunity Scholarship Act, during a recent interview on News 12 New Jersey’s Power & Politics show.

""(The Opportunity Scholarship Act) would be funded directly from public school budgets,"" Rubin said during the show broadcast on Dec. 3 and 4. ""So it would absolutely take money out of the public school system to transfer to private and religious schools.""

After reviewing the legislation, PolitiFact New Jersey determined that Rubin skipped a few elements of the proposed voucher program, but she still has a point that public schools would lose state aid as a result.

There’s no direct link between the scholarships and public school budgets, as Rubin said. Students would receive scholarships through donations made by corporations, and use them to pay for tuition at other public schools or private schools.

However, those corporations would get tax credits in return, and to make up for that lost tax revenue, the state would withhold aid from the students’ original school districts.

In a phone interview, Rubin acknowledged the process involving the tax credits, but argued that public schools are ultimately paying for the program.

""It’s like a money laundering scheme,"" Rubin told us. ""It’s a direct reduction in school aid. So the schools are paying for it.""

Let’s explain how the proposed voucher program would work:

The Opportunity Scholarship Act is part of Gov. Chris Christie’s education reform agenda, but the legislation has stalled in the Legislature since early this year. About two weeks ago, opponents and supporters of the bill held competing rallies, one in Jersey City and one in Trenton.

The current version of the Act would set up a five-year pilot program to award scholarships to public and private school students residing in 13 school districts with failing schools, including Asbury Park and Newark. Public school students would be able to leave those districts and attend school elsewhere.

Three organizations throughout the state would distribute the scholarships to parents or guardians of the selected students.

Corporations making donations for the scholarships would get tax credits worth 100 percent of the value of their donations, costing the state millions’ worth of tax revenue. That’s where the school aid dollars come in.

According to the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, which analyzed the Senate version of the bill, up to nearly $1.2 billion in state aid would be initially withheld from the 13 districts over the course of the program. Of that amount, about $354 million would be returned to the districts, according to OLS.

But the remaining roughly $840 million would be retained by the state to offset the loss of corporate business taxes, according to OLS.

So, the scholarships would not be directly funded by public school dollars, but in a roundabout way, education aid would be withheld to cover the tax credits granted to donors providing the scholarships.

But Adam Bauer, a spokesman for Republican state Sen. Tom Kean Jr., one of the bill’s sponsors, argued that under the state’s school funding formula, schools would lose a proportionate share of state aid if their enrollment declined for any other reason.

""That’s how the formula works,"" Bauer said in an email. ""Why then is it such a travesty when this happens as a result of a student choosing to go elsewhere as part of a scholarship program?""

Our ruling

In a television interview, Rubin claimed the Opportunity Scholarship Act ""would be funded directly from public school budgets"" and ""take money out of the public school system to transfer to private and religious schools.""

The program would not make a direct link between public school budgets and the scholarships. But to offset the cost of tax credits awarded to the scholarship donors, the participating school districts would lose state aid.

We rate the statement Mostly True.

Doggett says $1 of extended unemployment benefits will boost economy $1.61
","
Urging Congress to act quickly, U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett recently laid out his case for renewing ""emergency"" extended unemployment insurance for another year.

In a Dec. 8, 2011, opinion piece on the Huffington Post website, the Austin Democrat quoted a little ""Workin’ Man"" from the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and then listed bold-faced ""Facts"" including, ""Fact: One economist estimates that for every $1 we spent on unemployment insurance benefits, we get $1.61 in economic activity back.""

That rang a bell. We were already checking a nearly identical statement on a Web page posted by the Democrats of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, and we’d found that another PolitiFact writer checked a similar claim in 2010.

Were they all the same? Basically, yes, Doggett spokeswoman Sarah Dohl told us: All three statements relied on a single estimate from Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi.

The factoid was used, then as now, as an argument for extending the federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation program, created in 2008 and originally set to expire in a year. It’s been extended eight times, and the current law providing support for up to 99 weeks expires Jan. 3, 2012. If it isn’t extended, most people who lose their jobs after that will get a maximum 26 weeks of state unemployment benefits.

During a July 2010 Congressional standoff over renewing the benefits, PolitiFact rated U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen’s version of the statement Half True. She got Zandi’s number about right, PolitiFact observed, but other experts disputed the economist’s results.

Dohl told us the $1.61 estimate came from Zandi’s testimony to the House budget committee on July 1, 2010.

Next, we checked with Zandi to see if his $1.61 number still held. He told us that he updates such numbers every quarter and that his most recent figure, for the second quarter of 2011, is $1.55.

Why the decrease? Zandi said new data are confirming suspicions that extending unemployment benefits means some workers just stay unemployed longer. ""If they are not working, then less is produced and the economy is smaller,"" he said.

This ""disincentive"" effect includes some fraud, Zandi pointed out. But it isn’t always dishonest -- sometimes the worker uses the time to find a better job, and if that worker is an unemployed rocket scientist who could earn $125,000 a year, it’s much better for the economy if he or she is earning and spending that cash instead of living on the minimum wage.

We also asked Zandi how he generates such estimates in the first place. How might handing $1 to an unemployed worker make the nation’s gross domestic product eventually increase by $1.55?

The basic idea is that Uncle Sam hands an unemployed person $1, and that person buys, perhaps, groceries with it; the grocery owner in turn will need to order more vegetables, and the dollar continues to change hands, losing a few cents in some transactions, perhaps gaining in others. Some value leaches away into transaction costs, taxes or savings; but the dollar can generate growth, too -- for example, if the grocery store owner has to hire more staff.

Zandi said he uses a complex econometric model with hundreds of equations to determine whether a dollar spent on unemployment compensation drives the GDP up or down and how much. Essentially, he told us, you take a certain period of time, figure out how much was spent on unemployment insurance and how much GDP went up, and try to hold all the other factors equal.

He also produces estimates on how much bang for the buck the U.S. government gets from many other spending options. That’s part of what he was telling the House committee: which policy options he believes can boost the economy most.

A few examples from Zandi’s Aug. 26, 2011 report on the economy: 
• Spending $1 on unemployment insurance boosts GDP by $1.55. 
• Cutting corporate tax rates $1 will boost GDP by 32 cents. 
• Cutting taxes $1 across the board will boost GDP by 98 cents. 
• Spending $1 to increase food stamps temporarily will boost GDP by $1.71. 
In its most ridiculously oversimplified form, the equation to get that first number could be written as $1 times X equals $1.55. ""X"" is the multiplier -- and if the multiplier is larger than 1, your money goes up. If the multiplier is less than 1, your money goes down.

So in this chart, Zandi’s stating that the multiplier for corporate tax rate cuts was 0.32; the multiplier for across-the-board tax cuts was 0.98; and the multiplier for increasing food stamps was 1.71.

Doggett’s spokeswoman had also sent us a study, commissioned by the U.S. Department of Labor and others, that used Moody’s models (and some of Zandi’s work) to conclude that during the recession that began in 2008, every dollar spent on unemployment insurance boosted the gross domestic product $2.

Different results are generated by different time periods, different equations and different data sets, as with the Labor study, but Zandi said the main thing to note here is that each multiplier is not a fixed point. ""The multipliers depend on the state of the economy. If the economy is operating full-out, then the multiplier will be low and could even be negative.  If the economy is very weak, then the multiplier will be large,"" he told us.

But herein lies the foundation for one objection to Zandi’s models: Some economists believe it’s not realistic to predict any GDP increase.

Harvard economist Robert Barro is prominent among them, writing Aug. 24, 2011 in the Wall Street Journal that ""this idea — that one can magically get back more than one puts in — conflicts with what I will call ‘regular economics.’""

So there’s one fundamental objection. PolitiFact reported more concerns last year, including: 
• An economist from the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute cited a survey of 10 scholars’ research -- using different methods -- indicating that $1 spent in tax cuts might increase GDP, but $1 in increased government spending would decrease GDP. That is, for tax cuts the multiplier is above 1, but for government spending the multiplier is below 1. 
• Some researchers say unemployment spending will drag the economy down long-term, because the government will eventually have to raise taxes in order to keep paying out. 
• Scholars from the conservative Heritage Foundation said it’s invalid to assume the unemployed person will rush out and spend the whole dollar. 
Zandi agreed that if the unemployment benefits are ""financed by a larger deficit, then it will result in weaker long-term growth."" But, he said, if it ""helps avoid a more severe downturn in the economy now, then it could very well be worth the long-term cost.""

As to spending the whole dollar, Zandi said his view remains that ""most unemployed workers will spend their unemployment insurance very soon after they receive it."" If you give a dollar to Bill Gates, he said, the billionaire might not spend it at once, but ""many people are living paycheck to paycheck, not thinking 10 years down the road.""

So, clearly, economists diverge on whether, and how much, spending on unemployment benefits might boost the economy.

For more perspective, PolitiFact looked at estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. In January 2010, the CBO estimated a dollar in unemployment aid would increase GDP between $0.70 to $1.90 -- so Shaheen’s $1.60 was at the high end, but still in the ballpark.

A Nov. 15, 2011, CBO update says that a dollar in unemployment aid would increase the GDP between $0.40 to $1.90. Zandi’s latest estimate of a $1.55 increase in GDP falls toward the high end of that range.

But that’s not the amount Doggett cited. He’s repeating $1.61, which makes the outcome look rosier than it might really be -- even setting aside other economists’ concerns with making such a projection.

Our ruling

Doggett cites an economist’s projection that the country gets a 61 percent return on each additional dollar in unemployment aid. But his ""fact"" overlooks another fact: Economists are divided over whether unemployment aid increases GDP.  Also, Doggett’s statement specifies a figure from mid-2010 that’s been out of date for about a year. A failure to update it is like failing to update the national employment rates.

The only certain fact here is that an economist did once estimate $1.61.

Our sense is you can’t take Doggett’s statement to the bank. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809711BE80>],/factchecks/2011/dec/15/lloyd-doggett/doggett-says-1-extended-unemployment-benefits-will/

Republican challenger Marisha Agana says U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan contributed ""billions"" to the national debt
","
Since arriving in Congress after a hard-fought 2002 campaign, Tim Ryan hasn’t had to break much of a sweat to keep his seat representing the heavily Democratic 17th District.

He plans to compete for sixth term next year in the reconfigured 13th District, part of a Republican-drawn map that eliminates two Ohio seats because of slow population growth.

And though the Niles Democrat’s Youngstown-Warren base remains intact, the district now includes more of Akron and Summit County to the west, as well as a portion of Stark County. Two candidates have filed signatures to challenge him in the primary, but conventional wisdom says Ryan will cruise into the 2012 general election. Which brings us to Marisha Agana.

Agana, a pediatrician from the Warren suburb of Howland Township, is running for the seat as a Republican. Despite the political makeup of the district, she is positioning herself as an unquestionable conservative and casting Ryan as an unabashed liberal.

""Our Democratic incumbent is a prime example of the problem throughout Congress,"" Agana said in a news release announcing her candidacy. ""The American Conservative Union gives Ryan a dismal 0.0 percent rating for the billions he has contributed to our national debt.""

The second part of Agana’s statement caught PolitiFact Ohio’s eye.

As congressional campaigns ratchet up in the coming months, candidates are sure to use such partisan rankings in hopes of defining their opponents as too liberal or too conservative. But given Ryan’s pro-gun and anti-abortion proclivities, we wondered if Agana’s was playing fair.

First, some background on ACU. The Alexandria, Va., advocacy group bills itself as the nation’s ""oldest and largest grassroots conservative organization."" In February, ACU released its annual congressional ratings, based on how the 435 House members decided on 24 issues in 2010.

""The votes selected in this edition of the ACU Ratings of Congress are not always considered the ‘most important’ votes as defined by others,"" the group says on its website. ""Instead, the votes selected are chosen to create a clear ideological distinction among those casting them.""

Congressional representatives are rated based on how often they vote in accordance with ACU beliefs on those selected topics. Votes tracked in 2010 ranged from the establishment of Native Hawaiian sovereignty to the extension of unemployment benefits. (ACU opposed both.)

Ryan’s votes on all 24 measures put him at odds with the group, earning him a 0 percent.

Historically, though, Ryan has a slightly better record on ACU issues. In 2009, when he was in agreement with the organization on one of 25 votes, he received a 4 percent rating. Overall, for the eight full years he has served in Congress, Ryan has an 13.25 percent rating.

Agana obviously was referring to Ryan’s most recent 0 percent rating. She also attributed the goose egg to the ""billions he has contributed to our national debt."" Not only does that claim contain hyperbole that might give the impression Ryan alone has contributed billions of dollars to the national debt, it also is far less verifiable. And we checked with ACU spokeswoman Kristy Campbell, who said that the ratings are based on votes in ""three main areas.""

Besides fiscal issues, which would include the debt, ACU also looks for ""strong national defense"" votes and ""social/traditional values,"" Campbell said via email.

""As many of the votes we rate are related to spending and fiscal discipline, it is not inaccurate
to say the congressman received a 0.0 score in 2010 because of his contribution to the national debt,"" Campbell added. ""However, last year, he also received a 0.00 percent rating across the spectrum of other issues important to conservatives,"" including the ""Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell"" repeal.

Most of the votes ACU rates could be classified directly or indirectly as a fiscal issue because of spending requirements and the impact on the budget. But as even Campbell acknowledges, Ryan’s votes on these issues do not represent the entire reason he received a 0 percent rating.

Agana paints Ryan with too broad a brush in her statement. While it’s true his most recent ACU rating was 0, Ryan has a higher lifetime score than all but two Ohio Democrats ranked in 2010: Rep. Zack Space, who lost a re-election bid last year, and Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Toledo.

Ryan is no conservative, but he is more moderate than Agana implied.

As for the ""billions"" of dollars for which Agana holds Ryan directly responsible, spokeswoman Patricia Brant told PolitiFact Ohio that the campaign was stating a simple ""cause and effect."" Brant said votes on certain fiscal issues added billions of dollars to the federal deficit. The national debt is the accumulation of annual budget deficits.

But for PolitiFact Ohio, simplicity should not come at the expense of accuracy. Agana’s statement is an exaggeration. Her words exclusively tagged Ryan, one of 435 congressional representatives, with adding billions of dollars to the debt.

While there is some truth at the core of her argument, Agana played too fast and loose with the facts. On the Truth-O-Meter, her claim merits a rating of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A42FF80>],/factchecks/2011/dec/15/marish-agana/republican-challenger-marisha-agana-says-us-rep-ti/

Newt Gingrich says the Obama administration instructed terrorism training to not mention Islam
","Republicans on the presidential campaign trail regularly suggest that President Barack Obama is soft on terrorism and too tolerant of what they say is an enduring threat from Islamic radicals.

Obama batted away such appeasement charges at a Dec. 8, 2011, news conference, but the insinuation arose again during a two-person foreign policy debate on Dec. 12, 2011, between former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire.

Gingrich said American efforts to combat terrorism under Obama had no coherent theme, unlike the Cold War-era theory of ""supporting everybody who is not a communist.""

In fact, Gingrich said, ""The Obama administration just issued instructions that terrorism training should not involve any reference to Islam. Well, that would be like talking about the Cold War and not mentioning communism. How do you describe ‘radical Islamist’ if you're not allowed to say ‘radical Islamist?’ It's a willful denial of reality on a scale that is breathtaking.""

Could Gingrich be right on this one?

His campaign spokesman, R.C. Hammond, referred PolitiFact to several documents Hammond said were germane.

Most critically, Hammond cited a speech by Deputy Attorney General James Cole on Oct. 19, 2011, at a ""Conference on Post-9/11 Discrimination,"" which followed revelations by Wired that training material used by the FBI unfairly stereotyped Muslims.

One of the documents, for example, referred to the Prophet Mohammad as a ""cult leader,"" and said jihad and ""Just War"" traditions were part of the ""strategic themes and drivers"" in Islamic law. ""The strategic themes animating these Islamic values are not fringe; they are main stream,"" the document stated.

The report of the loaded language about Islam drew criticism from the Arab American Institute and other groups, and Cole’s speech appeared to be a response. Cole warned of ""stereotyping"" and said, ""All of us must reject any suggestion that every Muslim is a terrorist or that every terrorist is a Muslim.  As we have seen time and again – from the Oklahoma City bombing to the recent attacks in Oslo, Norway – no religion or ethnicity has a monopoly on terror.""

Even more to the point, Cole said, ""We also are working comprehensively to ensure that every aspect of the Department’s work reflects sensitivity and respect for all peoples and faiths. As just one example, to that end, I recently directed all components of the Department of Justice to re-evaluate their training efforts in a range of areas, from community outreach to national security, to make sure they reflect that sensitivity.""

While the speech did not ban ""any reference to Islam,"" Hammond, Gingrich’s spokesman, also referred to a report on Cole’s speech in the right-leaning The Daily Caller, which said the ""Obama administration was pulling back all training materials used for the law enforcement and national security communities, in order to eliminate all references to Islam that some Muslim groups have claimed are offensive.""

In a phone interview the day after Gingrich made his claim, Justice Department spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said Cole’s speech never did what Gingrich asserted it had.

""No one has ever said we are barring the word ‘Islam’ from training materials,"" she said.

And James Zogby, the founder and president of the Arab American Institute, who had raised concerns about the FBI material, also said Gingrich was overstating what had taken place.

""There’s been no order, no banning. No decision has been made, other than let’s evaluate and see whether (the training materials) are helping or hurting,"" said Zogby, who said he discussed the matter with someone in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights division after being contacted by PolitiFact. ""An evaluation does not constitute a banning.""

Asked whether he believed a discussion of Islam was appropriate in the counter-terror training, Zogby, a Catholic with a Ph.D. in Islamic studies, said yes, because ""it’s a misunderstood religion, we need to know more about it … Should law enforcement be studying the religion? Of course they should, but they should be studying it as it is and not as bigots imagine it."" While the Justice Department denial certainly calls into question Gingrich's statement, Hammond, his spokesman, also cited a Talking Points Memo story on the training material controversy that focused on Dwight Holton, the former U.S. attorney in Oregon. Holton, who was in office when Mohamed Osman Mohamud was arrested in November 2010, after allegedly trying to detonate what he believed was a car bomb at a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, Ore., told TPM, ""I want to be perfectly clear about this: training materials that portray Islam as a religion of violence or with a tendency towards violence are wrong, they are offensive, and they are contrary to everything that this president, this attorney general and the Department of Justice stands for."" The Gingrich camp highlighted a portion of that story that said the 37-page complaint against Mohamud, a Somali-American, did not state that he was a Muslim. Holton said what was ""relevant is the violence,"" not his religion. Some other evidence to consider: a 12-page document released by the White House in August 2011, ""Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States,"" wades into the complicated challenge authorities face in dealing with potential efforts to radicalize Americans. ""Groups and individuals supporting al-Qaida's vision are attempting to lure Americans to terrorism in order to create support networks and facilitate attack planning, but this also has potential to create a backlash against Muslim Americans. Such a backlash would feed al-Qaida’s propaganda that our country is anti-Muslim and at war against Islam, handing our enemies a strategic victory by turning our communities against one another; eroding our shared sense of identity as Americans; feeding terrorist recruitment abroad; and threatening our fundamental values of religious freedom and pluralism,"" the August document stated.

Also, a 23-page White House document issued in December 2011, ""Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States,"" mentions Islam only once, though it does refer more often to the threat from al-Qaida. ""As President Obama emphasized, when discussing Muslim Americans in the context of al-Qaida's attempts to divide us, 'we don't differentiate between them and us. It's just us,'"" the document states. More often, the December plan issued by the White House uses language like ""community resilience programming"" and the importance of ""enhancing engagement with and support to local communities that may be targeted by violent extremists,"" without explicitly saying that many of those communities are, in fact, Muslim-American.

The Ruling

There is no question that the Obama administration has tried to address Islam carefully and to avoid blaming a religion with an estimated 1.6 billion adherents for terrorism.

But we find Gingrich has greatly exaggerated what the Obama administration has done. Although the Justice Department clearly has yanked some questionable material related to Islam, and the recent White House document refers almost obliquely to Muslim Americans, it has not banned a discussion of al-Qaida or Islam in terrorism training. We rate his statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4a63a2e7-e660-45ca-baf0-09be0791dec4",[<zip object at 0x0000028097977280>],/factchecks/2011/dec/14/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-obama-administration-issued-ins/

Romney: Gingrich wants to scrap child labor laws
","
Newt Gingrich has a bold solution for helping kids in poor communities climb out of poverty: put them to work.

The Republican presidential candidate and current front-runner in many polls suggested, in a Q & A with students at Harvard University Nov. 18, that poor children should be paid to work as janitors in their schools to learn a work ethic and begin to rise to prosperity.

""Get any job that teaches you to show up on Monday. Get any job that teaches you to stay all day, even if you’re having a fight with your girlfriend. I mean, the whole process of making work worthwhile is central,"" the former House speaker said.

Gingrich has taken considerable heat over his comments, and in an interview with Fox News on Dec. 6, his Republican rival Mitt Romney highlighted the issue as one on which he and Gingrich differ.

""Speaker Gingrich has said that we ought to get rid of our child labor laws. That, I think, is a mistake,"" Romney told Fox’s Carl Cameron.

Ditching the nation’s child labor laws would be a radical move. We wanted to know if that’s what Gingrich is really proposing.

What he said

At Harvard, a female freshman stood and asked Gingrich what he proposes to do about growing income inequality and declining social mobility in America.

Gingrich cited three main factors that have caused the inequality -- the collapse of the housing market, which took much of middle-class America’s wealth with it; a decline in manufacturing jobs, which he blames on government policies; and an education system that fails poor kids while cutting off other pathways out of poverty.

""Core policies of protecting unionization and bureaucratization against children in the poorest neighborhoods crippling them by putting them in schools that fail has done more to create income inequality in the United States than any other single policy"" he said. ""It is tragic what we do in the poorest neighborhoods entrapping children in, first of all, in child laws which are truly stupid. Okay, you say to somebody, ‘you shouldn’t go to work before you’re what, 14, 16 years of age. Fine. You’re totally poor. You’re in a school that is failing with a teacher that is failing.’

""I tried for years to have a very simple model. Most of these schools ought to get rid of the unionized janitors, have one master janitor, and pay local students to take care of the school. The kids would actually do work, they would have cash, they’d have pride in the schools, they’d begin the process of rising.

""You go out and talk to, as I do regularly, talk to people who are really successful in one generation. They all started their first job between 9 and 14 years of age. They all were either selling newspapers, going door to door, they were doing something. They were washing cars. They all learned how to make money at a very early age. What do we say to poor kids in poor neighborhoods? Don’t do it. Remember all the stuff about don’t get a hamburger-flipping job -- the worst possible advice to give to poor children.

""Get any job that teaches you to show up on Monday. Get any job that teaches you to stay all day, even if you’re having a fight with your girlfriend. I mean, the whole process of making work worthwhile is central.""

His remarks generated a lot of buzz, and Gingrich addressed the issue again at a campaign stop in Des Moines, Iowa on Dec. 1.

""You have a very poor neighborhood. You have kids who are required under law to go to school. They have no money. They have no habit of work. What if you paid them part time in the afternoon to sit in the clerical office and greet people as they came in? What if you paid them to work as the assistant librarian? And I'd pay them as early as is reasonable and practical.""

""Then we get down to the janitor thing,"" Gingrich continued, in reference to his previous comments. ""(I received) letters written that said janitorial work is really hard and really dangerous and this and that. OK, fine. So what if they became assistant janitors and their job was to mop the floor and clean the bathroom. And you paid them.""

On Dec. 6, in a radio interview with host Curtis Sliwa on WNYM-AM 970, Gingrich further clarified what jobs he thinks young kids should and shouldn’t have. ""They could be the person who greets you when you walk in the door,"" Gingrich said, according to POLITICO. ""They could help in the school library. They can help in the kitchen. They can help clean up after lunch.""

""Kids shouldn't work in coal mines, kids shouldn't work in heavy industry,"" he said.

What the law says

Child labor laws are contained in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. According to the Department of Labor, the laws ""were enacted to ensure that when young people work, the work is safe and does not jeopardize their health, well-being or educational opportunities. These provisions also provide limited exemptions.""

The law establishes that minors be paid minimum wage, sets hours that 14- and 15-year-olds can work (i.e., not after 7 p.m. except in the summer) and prohibits youths from working in places like mines, factories or boiler and engine rooms. They are permitted to do office work, kitchen cleaning, cashiering, bagging and customer carry-out. (Our favorite exemption: ""the making of wreaths composed principally of natural holly, pine, cedar, or other evergreens."") 
Based on Gingrich's remarks, he doesn't appear to have any desire to do away with the law's provisions banning youngsters from dangerous workplaces. His argument, instead, seems to be with restrictions on younger children working.

Gingrich’s side

R.C. Hammond, Gingrich’s campaign spokesman, said the point of Gingrich’s idea is ""to instill a work ethic in every youngster.""

""To help you start off on the right foot and be successful in life, it’s helpful to start work early,"" Hammond said. ""The point that Newt was making is that public schools should make opportunities to go to work. It could be anything, and it’s pretty much on par with whatever your first summer job was.""

(Hammond’s first job: camp counselor. Gingrich's, in Stuttgart, Germany, where his father was serving in the Army, was at a bowling alley that didn’t have an automatic pin replacer. ""They hired Newt to go and replace the pins that had been knocked down,"" Hammond told us.)

So was Romney correct that Gingrich wants to do away with the existing law?

""Any characterization that doesn’t encompass what we just discussed is inaccurate,"" Hammond said.

Other perspectives

Jeffrey Miron, a Harvard University economics lecturer and senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, said he thought saying Gingrich wants to get rid of the law ""seems a little broad brushed and overly strong. It would be a weakening of child labor laws."" But that might not be all bad, he said. 
""For some families it would be nice if another $10 or $20 a week came in, and I think that parents are better at making those decisions than a blanket rule,"" he said. ""Why should it be the government’s business?"" 
We talked to other experts on child labor who said that the changes to the law Gingrich has talked about probably would do more harm than good.

Eric Edmonds, a Dartmouth College economics professor and author of the book Child Labor and the Transition Between School and Work, recently wrote about Gingrich’s take on child labor.

""The issue is that workers that start unskilled stay unskilled. Especially if their education is suffering as a result. Working children do not learn skills that are going to help them to succeed in today’s technologically advanced global economy. How is learning to be an unskilled laborer at an early age going to help families in the long-run?"" Edmonds wrote. ""It is not ... We’ve seen what happens when successive generations of families need their children to work. They are unable to escape poverty.""

Hugh Hindman, a professor of Labor & Human Resources at Appalachian State University, said Gingrich is not the first leader to recommend child labor as an anti-poverty program, but that it doesn’t work.

""It has never worked to alleviate poverty, except in the very short-term, and it exacerbates poverty in the longer term. There is a phenomenon known as the ‘child labor trap’ … very poor parents send their children to work as household survival strategy. Consequently the children forfeit schooling and fail to acquire the human capital that would qualify them for anything other than low-wage work as adults. These become the very poor parents of the next generation who send their children to work as household survival strategy. And on again into the next generation,"" Hindman said.

He added that jobs such as babysitting that Gingrich mentioned are beneficial for young people, but the opportunity to do them are ""skewed in favor of middle and upper-middle class children.""

""If Mr. Gingrich could find a way to provide more poor children with these sorts of opportunities, he might well do some good,"" Hindman said. 
""There’s not a golf course (in their neighborhoods),"" said Harvard's Miron, ""but there’s a grocery store down the street that needs boxes stacked or the sidewalk swept."" 
Our ruling

Romney said, ""Speaker Gingrich has said that we ought to get rid of our child labor laws.""

We found that Gingrich has proposed some unconventional changes to child labor legislation, which he called ""truly stupid."" Specifically, he said that kids younger than 14 growing up in poverty should be allowed to work as a means of elevating themselves. But he also clarified that children shouldn’t hold mining or industrial jobs.

While Gingrich appears to be in favor of easing age restrictions on working, he has given no indication that he wants to ""get rid of"" many other provisions, such as those that prohibit kids from working in certain dangerous occupations.

Pat Roberts claims Jon Corzine is the first former Senator to be “subpoenaed to testify before his former colleagues.""
","
One lawmaker claims Jon Corzine made history this week on Capitol Hill.

But not by choice.

The Senate Agriculture Committee voted to compel Corzine, a former senator and governor of New Jersey, to testify Tuesday about the collapse of MF Global, the investment firm he headed. Sen. Pat Roberts, the committee’s ranking member, said subpoenaing Corzine was an unprecedented measure.

""It's the first time, I think, in history where a former senator has been subpoenaed to testify before his former colleagues,"" Roberts, a Republican from Kansas, said in an interview on Fox Business News on Dec. 6, when the Senate committee voted to compel Corzine to testify.

During last week’s vote, Roberts said that ""based on consultations with the Senate historian’s office, it is also unclear if any former member of the Senate has been compelled to testify before a Senate committee. It is our understanding that such action could be a first.""

We checked with the Senate historian’s office and found that, as far as they know, Roberts is right.

Former senators have been forced to testify before a House committee, but Corzine is the first former senator known to be subpoenaed by a Senate committee.

Corzine served as the chairman and CEO of MF Global, which went bankrupt this fall. During the company’s collapse, as much as $1.2 billion in client money disappeared.

Katherine Scott, an assistant historian at the U.S. Senate Historical Office, noted limits to definitively identifying former senators subpoenaed to testify before congressional committees. ""Subpoena documents are kept with committee files at the National Archives. Hearing transcripts were not methodically collected prior to the early 20th century,"" she said in an email.

However, the Senate historian’s office found one instance where two former senators were forced to testify before a House committee.

In 1908,  Matthew Butler of South Carolina and Marion Butler of North Carolina were subpoenaed and testified before a House committee investigating the lobbying tactics of the Electric Boat Company of New Jersey and their predecessors, the Holland Boat Company.

The two former senators, who were not related, denied any wrongdoing in their work with the companies, which built submarines, and no charges were brought against the former lawmakers.

So that’s an example of former senators being forced to testify before a House committee. But as far as the U.S. Senate Historical Office knows, Corzine is the first senator subpoenaed to testify in front of a Senate committee.

But Terry Madonna, the director of the center for politics and public affairs at Franklin & Marshall College in Pennsylvania, said Corzine won’t be the last.

""The Senate to be sure is very precedent driven--so once this precedent has been established, you can bet it won't be the last time it will happen,"" he said. But he also noted that the MF Global issue is ""unusually salient because of the heightened interest in the actions of the investment community in general and Wall Street in particular.""

Our ruling

Roberts claimed that Jon Corzine is the first former senator to be ""subpoenaed to testify before his former colleagues.""

Corzine is the first senator to be compelled to testify before Congress in more than 100 years. And as far as Senate historian’s office knows, he’s the first to be subpoenaed to testify in front of a Senate committee.

Based on that information, we rate Roberts’ statement True.

Claim: Savannah ports impact on environment can ""clearly"" be mitigated
","
Congress cleared the way for Georgia to transform Savannah’s harbor into the port of the future way back in 1999. Then old-fashioned Mother Nature had her say.

Planners found that deepening the port to fit modern megaships will destroy some of the delicate wetlands nearby. More than a decade later, they’re still mulling over what to do about it.

The Georgia Ports Authority, which is behind the dredging, thinks there’s little doubt planners can make it work. Executive Director Curtis Foltz wrote in an op-ed that appeared in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that it’s time to push ahead.

""The study of the Savannah River Estuary — the most comprehensive in history — clearly demonstrates the project can be constructed and impacts will be mitigated,"" Foltz said.

This claim puzzled the Truth-O-Meter team. If a study ""clearly demonstrates"" that port dredgers can address the environmental concerns, what’s the holdup?

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is the federal agency in charge of studying improvements to harbors and their effects. The agency wrote the study Foltz mentioned.

The port is next door to the Savannah National Wildlife Refuge, which is home to 10 threatened or endangered species, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Dredging will affect the Savannah River estuary, a type of habitat where fresh water mixes with salty ocean water. A number of species can’t reproduce without estuaries.

The corps’ ""Tier II Environmental Impact Statement for the Savannah Harbor Expansion"" was released in draft form for public comment in November 2010,  and details how port planners aim to ease the damage to the environment that dredging will cause.

The heads of several federal departments must sign off on the corps’ assessment before the dredging begins, and they haven’t done so yet.

We found that while the corps is optimistic that it can mitigate the impacts of the dredging, other arms of the federal government and an independent analysis found weaknesses in the plan.  

For the sake of simplicity, we’ll focus on two of the most heavily contested issues in this debate: preserving the endangered shortnose sturgeon, and dealing with the loss of the waterway’s dissolved oxygen, which fish and other marine life need to survive.  

The endangered shortnose sturgeon is a 3-foot-long fish with a bony plate of armor and an upturned nose. Dredging the port will destroy a significant percentage of its habitat, according to the environmental impact study, so the corps proposed to expand it by building a ""fishway.""

This passage would connect shortnose sturgeon to other portions of the river where they can thrive. A dam currently blocks the route.   

The corps’ draft environmental study concluded that the impacts on the fish ""will be mitigated,"" but the National Marine Fisheries Service raised objections to the corps two months after the draft’s release.

As designed, the proposed passage was ""not likely to be successful in passing sturgeon to justify its use"" to make up for habitat destruction, according to a letter the Fisheries Service sent to the corps.   

The two agencies worked out changes to the fishway. Last month, the Fisheries Service said the corps’ plan is ""not likely to jeopardize"" the shortnose sturgeon and other species, so long as the corps closely monitors the effort and meets other conditions.

Now, on to dissolved oxygen, which is what fish breathe by filtering water through their gills. Researchers expect the port’s expansion to lower the amount of dissolved oxygen in crucial parts of the harbor, so the corps proposed that they install equipment that will put oxygen back in.  

The National Marine Fisheries Service objected in a January letter to the corps. They said the equipment might not provide enough oxygen, and called it a ""very risky operation with a high degree of uncertainty.""

But after a few months of discussion, they sent a letter in November saying that they think the corps plan will adequately protect the fish. This letter included plans to closely monitor oxygen levels and make immediate changes if problems arise.

The U.S. Department of the Interior’s Fish and Wildlife Service also acknowledged that researchers disagree over whether the oxygen system will work. They told PolitiFact Georgia in a recent statement that they’re working on a plan to monitor the equipment when it’s installed to ensure it’s effective.

In February, a nonprofit group hired by the federal government to review the corps’ plans raised a different critique. The group said the oxygen injection system might release too much into certain areas of the harbor. This could have ""lethal impacts"" to fish, especially threatened and endangered species, the group’s report said.   

None of these comments said the problems are impossible to fix. They do question whether the corps plan will fall short of its goal.

We think it’s fair to say that while the corps’ environmental report may have concluded that dredgers can mitigate the environmental problems they would cause, as Foltz stated, critiques by other federal agencies and an independent study muddy the waters.

Foltz should have acknowledged their reservations. Since his statement needs more context, it meets PolitiFact’s definition of Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AC5200>],/factchecks/2011/dec/14/curtis-foltz/claim-savannah-ports-impact-environment-can-clearl/
"['Rhode Island', 'Gambling', 'State Budget', 'Eugene McKenna']","
Anti-casino activist says Rhode Island gets more revenue per capita from gambling than any other state
","
Despite a sluggish economy, gambling revenue continues to rise in Rhode Island. In fact, gambling is the state’s third-largest source of revenue, bringing in about $355 million in the 2011 fiscal year, according to a recent Journal story.

That’s a lot of money, especially for a state facing a huge budget deficit, but for one local group, Rhode Island’s dependence on gambling is far from a good thing.

In the Nov. 25 story, the Rev. Eugene J. McKenna, president of Citizens Concerned About Casino Gambling, said that the social costs of gambling far outweigh the financial benefits for the state. He tried to put the problem in perspective.

""Gambling is a losing proposition, no matter how you look at it,"" said Father McKenna, of South Kingstown. ""Rhode Island already gets more revenue per capita from gambling than any other state in the country.""

His claim intrigued us. Is Rhode Island really the national leader in per-capita gambling revenue? Above Nevada, home of the Las Vegas Strip? And New Jersey, which has Atlantic City?

We asked Father McKenna where he got his information. He said it’s a longstanding fact that Rhode Island leads the nation in gambling revenue per capita, but he couldn’t immediately give us proof.

After our inquiry, he contacted the Stop Predatory Gambling Foundation, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group, which cited two reports, one published in 2006 by the National Conference on State Legislatures and the other in 2008 by the Tax Foundation.

But there are problems with each list.

The National Conference of State Legislatures ranked Rhode Island second behind West Virginia in gambling revenue per capita. But it was a flawed comparison because Rhode Island reported only gross sales, while the other states reported net sales figures that accounted for expenses.

The Tax Foundation report, which put Rhode Island at the top of its list, analyzed only lottery sales per capita, not the revenue per capita that Father McKenna cited.

And neither report factored in revenues from other sources of gambling in other states, such as casinos, card rooms and racetracks. That’s an important point. Remember, McKenna did not refer only to lottery revenue in his comments. He spoke of gambling revenue.

So we searched for more relevant information.

Our search yielded a study that does consider gambling revenues as a whole and also calculates revenues on approximately a per capita basis.

The study comes from the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, in Albany, N.Y., which, in recent years, has produced annual reports on state-by-state gambling operations. The institute is a public policy think-tank that has been used as a source on state fiscal issues by The New York Times, Bloomberg, Reuters and other media.

The institute’s 2011 report looked promising. (It also appealed to us because its title, ""Back in the Black: States’ Gambling Revenues Rose in 2010,"" calls to mind our favorite AC/DC song.)

The report examines the four major types of legalized gambling from which states earn revenues -- lotteries, casinos, racinos and traditional pari-mutuel wagering on horse races, greyhound races and jai alai.

For Rhode Island, revenues from the state lottery, its two slot parlors, Twin River and Newport Grand, and other betting totaled about $346 million in the 2010 fiscal year. The study then calculated revenue per resident aged 18 or older, the legal gambling age in Rhode Island and most other states.

This is not per capita, but it’s a legitimate measure. The same calculation -- revenues per adult resident -- was done for every state, so the study compared apples to apples. The only way the number could be skewed is if Rhode Island has a markedly different ratio of adults than other states. According to the 2010 census, 76 percent of the national population is aged 18 or over. In Rhode Island, the number is 78.7 percent. That’s pretty close.

So using the Rockefeller Institute’s calculation, the gambling revenue figure worked out to about $418 per adult for the Ocean State. And that is indeed the highest in the nation. Nevada ranked second with $407 per adult and Delaware came in third with $397.

Our ruling

Both reports that Father McKenna referred us to in support of his statement came up short. Not only were they somewhat outdated, but they used flawed numbers and only considered revenues from lotteries and video lottery terminals.

But the Rockefeller Institute studies that we found took a comprehensive look at all the major types of gambling. And according to the most recent report, Rhode Island did receive more revenue per adult than any other state in fiscal 2010.

The reverend rolled the dice on this one and lady luck was on his side. We rule his statement True.

Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel says U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown has sent billions of our tax dollars to foreign countries
","
Federal spending is a major issue in the U.S. Senate campaign of Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, the Republican trying to unseat incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown. Mandel says spending is wasteful and unsustainable, and he names Brown as a reason.
Among several claims in Mandel's TV ad ""Change,"" which accuses Brown of trying to hide his record, is one that says ""Brown sent billions of our tax dollars to foreign countries.""

PolitiFact Ohio can't say if spending is wasteful, and we don't have a crystal ball to judge if it is sustainable. But we can assess if Brown is ""hiding"" (as the ad states) that he has sent billions of tax dollars overseas.

The ad's claim is spoken by an announcer and appears on screen next to a photo of Brown. In the background is a blended collage of the flags of Panama, China and South Korea.

The source cited in the ad for the claim is an article that appeared Sept. 9, 2010 in the Washington Times. The article said the Department of Energy had acknowledged that ""as much as 80 percent of some green (energy) programs, including $2.3 billion of manufacturing tax credits, went to foreign firms that employed workers primarily in countries including China, South Korea and Spain, rather than in the United States.""

The story also referred to a report by American University’s Investigative Reporting Workshop, in February 2010, that more than 79 percent of the first $2.1 billion in stimulus grants to wind energy companies went to foreign firms.

The report noted, however, that the grant money was distributed under a program administered by the Energy Department and Treasury, and not by Congress. In some instances, it said, the money went to the American subsidiaries of foreign companies.

The Washington Times story goes on to say that the Investigative Reporting Workshop report ""raised alarms in Congress. Leading Democrats insisted that the money be spent at home, but restrictions on the funds proved impossible without the specter of a trade war.""

Brown, who is not mentioned in the Washington Times article, was actually one of the senators who called for the Obama administration to suspend the program indefinitely ""until the law can be fixed so that funds only flow to projects that will create jobs in the United States.""

Co-sponsoring legislation to make that a requirement, Brown said, ""Taxpayers expect the government to use their dollars to support American jobs.""

PolitiFact Ohio looked at the wind project with the Chinese connection earlier this year and found it never got completed. Since companies could only collect money after completion and the program expired last year, it is safe to say that the amount that went to China was ""zero,"" Russ Choma, the reporter who performed the digging at the Investigative Reporting Workshop, told us.

Our friends at FactCheck.org, who also examined the Mandel ad's claim, found it to be ""highly misleading"" and not true.

Because the citation in the ad did not support the claim, we asked Mandel's campaign if it had additional sources.

""The charge in the ad is also supported by Sen. Brown's votes relative to foreign aid appropriations,"" spokesman Travis Considine said, citing a story from Politico as ""the most recent example of a vote held on the Appropriations Committee Sen. Brown sits on that approved $52.1 billion in foreign aid.""

He also provided a voting record to show that Brown ""has voted for at least $257.9 billion in foreign operations funding since he came to Washington in 1993."" The list included votes on omnibus appropriations bills, which cover many areas of spending and often enjoy wide bipartisan support.

The $52.1 billion figure in the Politico story refers to the State Department and foreign operations budget. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, that budget funds U.S. diplomatic and foreign aid activities, and ""has been the primary legislative vehicle through which Congress reviews the U.S. international affairs budget and influences executive branch foreign policy making in recent years.""

Included in the budget are the cost of building, staffing and protecting embassies and consular activities; funding for the war-related states of Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, which were exceeded by Israel as the top U.S. foreign aid recipients; foreign economic and security assistance, and contributions to international organizations and missions and multilateral financial institutions.

""U.S. national security, trade promotion, and humanitarian interests are rationales for most international affairs activities,"" the Congressional Research Service said in its report on the budget.

The CRS also summed up debate about the budget: ""International affairs expenditures typically amount to about 1.5 percent of the total federal budget. While some foreign policy and defense experts view that share as a small price to pay for a robust foreign affairs budget that they believe is essential to meeting national security and foreign policy objectives, others see international affairs spending, particularly foreign aid, as an attractive target for significant spending cuts in order to reduce deficit spending.""

How much could spending practically be cut?

Sen. Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma, is a fiscal conservative who has been called ""the Senate's chief waste-watcher."" He released a $9 trillion deficit reduction plan last year that would trim ""wasteful, duplicative and low-priority spending"" from the Department of State and its foreign operations budget.

He estimated the 10-year savings at $192 billion, which still would leave a multi-billion dollar foreign operations budget annually.

As for the ad's flags of China, Panama and South Korea, we have previously found Brown to be one of the Senate's most ardent critics of U.S. foreign trade policies. He has voted against trade deals with China, Panama and South Korea -- and Colombia, Central America, Mexico and Canada.

Let's bring it home.

The ad claims Brown sent billions of dollars to foreign countries. The information that the ad uses to back up that claim, that Brown voted for the stimulus bill, has been proven false. Brown did not make decisions on how that money would be spent, and he was one of the senators who called for its suspension after the foreign grants were reported.

When confronted with those facts, the Mandel campaign offered as support for its claim that Brown votes for appropriations for U.S. foreign operations. That's the money for embassies, war-related spending to help establish new governments and the U.S. portions of international missions. That's a ridiculous stretch from what the ad implies, which is that Brown tried to hide that he irresponsibly sent billions or our tax dollars to foreign countries.

We have a rating for statements that are both false and ridiculous. It's Pants on Fire.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Military', 'New Hampshire 2012', 'Jon Huntsman']","
Jon Huntsman says the U.S. spends more than all other countries combined on defense
","
Throughout the campaign, Republican presidential candidates have targeted Medicare, Medicaid and other federal entitlement programs for future budget cuts. But, this week, one candidate set his sites on the United States’ defense budget, which he said should be on the table, as well.

""If you look at defense … we're spending more than the rest of the world combined,"" former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman said Monday, December 12, 2011 in a debate with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich at St. Anselm College in Manchester, N.H. ""If you can’t find some efficiencies there …""

That the United States spends more on military than any other country in the world is not up for debate, analysts we contacted agreed. The United States, which guarantees the security of the 28 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, among other allies, spends at least six times more than the next largest spender, analysts said.

But do we, as Huntsman suggested, spend more than the rest of the world combined? PolitiFact is on the case.

Tracking military spending across the globe is always a challenge, according to industry analysts. Exchange rates and purchasing power, among other factors, can make it difficult to equate translate spending across borders, and many countries, including China, Russia and North Korea, don’t openly report their military budgets.

Nevertheless, a number of military analysts and international agencies have attempted to crunch the numbers, and most find Huntsman’s claim in doubt, concluding that the United States makes up closer to 40 or 45 percent of the world’s total military spending instead of the 50 percent plus suggested by Huntsman.

In London, for instance, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, an international think tank considered among the world’s military spending authorities, summarizes the military budget of countries across the globe in its annual report, ""The Military Balance."" The report does not, however, compare the United States’ budget to the world totals. Instead, Michael O’Hanlon, a military analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. took up that task while researching his recent book, ""The Wounded Giant: America's Armed Forces in an Age of Austerity.""

O’Hanlon’s calculations, based on the IISP data, show that, although the United States led the world in military spending in 2009, it did not exceed the total spending of the rest of the world. According to O’Hanlon’s count, the U.S.’s $660 billion made up about 45 percent of the world total of $1.46 trillion.

These numbers include both the federal defense budget, as well as war-time spending.

""It's close to right, but it's not quite right,"" O’Hanlon said Tuesday, referring to Huntsman’s claim. ""He’s close enough to be arguable …  but I find it a little sloppy.""

The United States’ share of world military spending would be even lower, O’Hanlon said, if analysts increased their estimates for countries, like China, that don’t report military spending.

""There are disagreements about what countries like China actually spend because they don't exactly have an open and transparent budgeting process,"" said Todd Harrison, senior fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, an independent think tank on defense and related spending.

""It really is more of a guesstimate for China and Russia,"" Harrison said.

The IISS conservatively estimated about $70 billion in Chinese military spending in 2009. But, if it were to increase the estimate as high as $150 billion, as do many analysts, that would raise the total world figure and lower the United States’ share as low as 40 or 42 percent, analysts said.

The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in Sweden, considered along with IISS among the world’s military spending authorities, estimated that China spent $119 billion on defense in 2010, the second most in the world. Using that number, total world spending reached $1.63 trillion and America’s $698 billion spending total made up about 42 percent of the world total, according to the Institute’s 2010 background paper on military expenditure data.

""It’s hard to tell because the numbers don’t translate exactly, but (United States spending is) more in the range of 40 or 45 percent,"" said Lawrence Korb, a former assistant secretary of defense under President Ronald Reagan and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank.

""Fifty percent is definitely a little high,"" Korb said.

Our ruling:

The evidence supports Huntsman's underlying point -- that the U.S. spends far more than other countries on defense, but it falls short of his claim that U.S. spending exceeds that of all other countries combined. International research shows that United States’ defense funds make up between 40 and 45 percent of the world’s total military spending.

Sen. Sherrod Brown says Republicans' refusal to confirm Richard Cordray to head consumer protection bureau was unprecedented
","
The U.S. Senate on Dec. 8 failed to confirm Richard Cordray to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with Republicans successfully blocking confirmation by using a procedural measure. It wasn’t that the GOP disliked Cordray, Ohio’s attorney general until his election defeat in 2010.

Rather, Republican senators said they would not support any nominee to the new agency unless its very structure was changed. They wanted, among other things, a five-member board to oversee the agency rather than a single director. And they wanted Congress to approve the agency’s budget rather than have it set by the Federal Reserve.

This would have required changing the 2010 financial reform law, known as Dodd-Frank, that created the agency -- or as U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown put it, it would require a change to the construction of the agency Cordray was nominated to direct.

As a date for a vote approached, Brown, an Ohio Democrat, said several times that the Republicans’ refusal was unprecedented. In a Senate Banking subcommittee hearing on Dec. 7, the day before the vote, Brown said, ""I probably know Richard Cordray better than any member of the Senate. I knew him when he was a state representative and county treasurer and state treasurer and attorney general and have continued to work with him. And there's no question of his qualification. And some time ago I asked the Senate historian has this ever happened, that a political party has blocked a nomination of someone because they didn't like the construction of the agency? And he said, no, it's never happened.""

The next day, shortly before the Senate failed to get enough votes to cut off debate and confirm the nominee, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said the same thing: ""This is the first time in Senate history a party has blocked a qualified candidate solely because they disagree with the existence of the agency that's being created by law.""

This struck PolitiFact Ohio as worth checking, for the current record and as a useful piece of political trivia.

We asked Brown’s communications director, Meghan Dubyak, for her boss’s source, and she shared with us language from email that Brown’s chief of staff, Mark Powden, received from Senate Historian Donald A. Ritchie.  We followed up by asking Ritchie for the original.

Ritchie wrote us back, and his short answer was, ""We searched through past cases and could not find anything that fit the current circumstance.""

Ritchie also provided the email that he exchanged with Brown’s office. It began when Powden contacted the historian and asked if he knew of a similar case of blanket objection to any nominee unless the agency itself was changed. Here is Ritchie’s answer, written on July 25, 2011, to Brown’s top aide:

""I’ve looked through our files and contacted the Senate Library, but have not found anything comparable. There were instances in the 19th Century -- during the John Tyler and Andrew Johnson administrations -- when the Senate defeated some of the president's most prominent nominations (including three times rejecting Tyler's nominee for Secretary of the Treasury).  Those instances involved major disagreements between Congress and the president over policy (Tyler vetoed the main provisions of the Whig party's agenda, and Johnson and Congress fell out over Reconstruction policy), but they did not involve a blanket blocking of nominees to a particular agency.""

Ritchie sent that email to Brown’s office at 12:52 p.m. Several hours later, he followed up with another email to Brown’s chief of staff: ""Mark, the Senate Library has been hunting for precedents, and found the attached controversy over the Legal Services Corporation in the 1980s that involved a letter signed by a majority of senators against three of the president's nominees.  The issue there was whether the nominees would support the spirit of the law, rather than requesting that the law be rewritten, so it's not exactly the same.""

This was in reference to a period in 1982 when the White House tried to weaken the Legal Services Corporation by nominating board members with conservative views of how far the government should extend its hand. The Legal Services Corporation helps pay for civil lawyers to serve the poor, and President Ronald Reagan and a bipartisan majority in the Senate were at odds over three of Reagan’s most conservative nominees, according to ""Congress and the Nation,"" a historical volume.

Jousting over Reagan’s nominees continued for several years, but as Ritchie said, the issue was whether the nominees would support the spirit of the law.

To better understand this distinction, it’s important to know that in the case of Cordray, 44 of the Senate’s 46 Republicans made clear in a letter before the Ohioan was even nominated that they would not accept any nominee unless the brand-new agency’s structure was changed. Theirs was a blanket blockade.

Was their goal to weaken the agency? Brown and other Democrats say so. That, too, was the goal of Reagan with the Legal Services Corporation. But there are two differences between the Reagan matter and the current case.

The Senate in the 1980s was not trying to use the confirmation process to change the architecture of the agency. Rather, Reagan was trying to use his appointments to change how aggressively or weakly the agency did its job. The agency, established in 1974, was already operating.

The other difference? Reagan, the president, was the one interested in slowing down the agency.  The Senate, on the other hand, wanted the agency to keep operating as usual.

Cordray’s case is the opposite. President Barack Obama supported the agency’s creation and wants it to get to work. But under the Dodd-Frank legislation it cannot write and enforce rules affecting payday lenders, private student loan providers, debt collectors, non-bank mortgage servicers or credit agencies until it has a director.

Senate Republicans say they will not confirm any director unless the agency’s oversight structure is changed. Lacking a majority, they failed to win those changes in the Dodd-Frank legislation, but they have sufficient numbers under procedural rules to halt confirmations.

This isn’t a question of which side is morally or politically correct.

But based on the record, including its nuance, we take the Senate historian’s word: Brown was correct when he said this was the first time that a political party has blocked a nomination unless changes were made to an agency. To repeat Ritchie’s words:  ""We searched through past cases and could not find anything that fit the current circumstance.""

We rate Brown’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AC1500>],/factchecks/2011/dec/12/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-republicans-refusal-confirm/
"['National', 'Medicare', 'Mitt Romney']","
Romney says only Obama has cut Medicare
","
Medicare, the health insurance program for seniors and the disabled, constitutes a massive and growing share of federal spending. Yet Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney says that in the more than four decades since its inception, only one president has ever cut the program’s budget.

""Let's not forget, only one president has ever cut Medicare for seniors in this country, and it's Barack Obama,"" Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, said in a Republican presidential debate on Dec. 10, 2011.

We looked into the accuracy of that statement and found Romney is way off.

First, did Obama cut Medicare?

The Romney campaign did not respond to our inquiry about this statement. We assume that when he said Obama cut Medicare, he was talking about the 2010 health care reform law that, among other things, reduces future Medicare spending by $500 billion.

But that’s just it -- the cuts don’t come from the current Medicare budget, they put a leash on future growth and payment increases.

PolitiFact has explored this before:

""The Affordable Care Act does reduce Medicare spending by $500 billion over the next 10 years. But here’s the catch: Those dollars aren’t taken out of the current budget, they are not actual cuts, and nowhere does the bill actually eliminate any current benefits,"" we wrote last month.

Which brings us to the next point. We note that, in the debate, Romney specified that Obama cut Medicare ""for seniors."" That sounds like he meant that Obama cut Medicare benefits.

That notion falls flat too. The health care law does not reduce benefits -- in fact, it enhances them.

""The Affordable Care Act improves the benefits in Medicare, in terms of prevention, in terms of filling in the donut hole in Medicare Part D for prescription drugs,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.

Oberlander said there’s only one ""leg to stand on"" in interpreting that the law reduces benefits.

""The Affordable Care Act reduces payments to Medicare Advantage plans. They’re overpaid by quite a lot -- excess payments above and beyond what it costs to treat people,"" he said. ""As a result of that, there are projections that some of those (plans) are going to trim some of the extra benefits."" Those could include benefits for vision or dental care.

""But,"" Oberlander said, ""that hasn’t happened so far, and it doesn’t affect the core benefits, the required Medicare benefits.""

Did other presidents make cuts?

In short, yes.

John Rother, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care, a coalition of trade associations, labor unions and advocacy groups that supports health care reform, offered some historical perspective on the matter.

In 1981, President Ronald Reagan in his first year in office signed an omnibus budget reconciliation act that raised Medicare deductibles for beneficiaries. Rother said he considers that a cut in benefits.

Two years later, Reagan and Congress enacted legislation that changed the way Medicare reimbursed hospitals. The program’s costs had been growing exponentially as hospitals treated patients and then sent the federal government the bills. It was known as ""retrospective cost-based reimbursement."" The new law established a ""prospective payment system,"" which categorized inpatient admission cases into what were called diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). In this system, Medicare pays hospitals a flat rate for each inpatient case.

""The system was intended to motivate hospitals to change the way they deliver services. With DRGs, it did not matter what hospitals charged anymore -- Medicare capped their payments,"" according to a 2001 report by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General.

The resulting savings to Medicare were $21-billion in the first three years, exceeding even the Congressional Budget Office projections. It cut the program, Rother said, but did not affect benefits.

In 1987, Reagan signed a law that expanded Medicare benefits, including drug coverage and catastrophic illness coverage. But when George H.W. Bush took office, he repealed it. So Rother puts Bush in the column of presidents who cut Medicare for seniors.

The Medicare program saw another major overhaul in 1997. President Bill Clinton signed the Balanced Budget Act, which tightened payments to doctors, nursing homes, home health agencies and health insurance plans and expanded the types of private plans that could participate in Medicare (the part of the program now known as Medicare Advantage).

Its goal was to trim $393.8 billion in spending over 10 years. But it’s a trickier question to answer whether that law cut benefits.

""With Clinton, it’s an indirect effect,"" Rother said. ""It did cut reimbursements to several providers who claimed they would not be able to serve the beneficiary population.""

The tally, then:

* Reagan cut Medicare by reducing payments to hospitals, and he cut benefits by raising deductibles.

* George H.W. Bush cut benefits by repealing a law that would have expanded coverage for drugs and catastrophic illness.

* Clinton cut Medicare by changing payments to doctors and other providers, which could be considered to have an indirect effect on beneficiaries.

* Obama cut future Medicare spending but expanded benefits.

Our ruling

Romney said, ""only one president has ever cut Medicare for seniors in this country and it's Barack Obama.""

The statement gets it wrong on every front. The Medicare belt was tightened in 1981 and 1982 under Reagan, in 1989 under the first President Bush and again in 1997 under Clinton. So Obama is in no way the only president to cut the program.

Further, by specifying that Obama cut Medicare ""for seniors,"" Romney seems to mean that the president slashed benefits, not just the program’s spending. That’s even more egregious. Other presidents have made changes to Medicare that reduced benefits for seniors, while the health care law Obama signed actually increases them. That’s a lot of inaccuracy in a single sentence. We rate Romney’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D471C0>],/factchecks/2011/dec/12/mitt-romney/romney-says-only-obama-has-cut-medicare/
