Are increased PERS costs responsible for a $500 per student increase in state spending?
","
During his recent State of the State address, Gov. John Kitzhaber defended a proposal to cap the cost of living adjustment for those on the public employee retirement system.

""If we are serious about reinvesting in the classroom, we cannot ignore the fact that the crisis in school funding – as well as the crisis in funding things like child protective services and home health care – is not just a revenue problem: it has also become a cost problem,"" the governor began.

""In this next biennium, the cost of primary and secondary education is going to increase by more than $1,000 per student. Half of that $1,000 – $500 per student – is accounted for by the increased cost of PERS alone …""

This isn’t the first time the governor has made this exact claim, so we thought it was time we checked it out.

We started by asking Kitzhaber’s spokeswoman, Amy Wojcicki, to tell us how the governor arrived at these statistics.

In an email, she said the governor started by looking at what it would cost the state to run the K-12 system during the 2013-15 biennium in the exact way its running currently -- this is also called current service level. Essentially, the same services that cost the state $5.715 billion this biennium are projected to cost the state $6.315 next biennium.

Then the governor took a look at that extra $600 million; a big chunk of it, $265 million, came from the PERS increase.

(As a side note, that steep increase stems from the 2007 stock market crash. Essentially, PERS is like any other investment portfolio; it rides the market up and down. However, when it’s on a downturn, there are still people expecting to get their pensions. In Oregon, that means the government has to go in and make up the losses.)

We wanted to verify these numbers independently of the governor's office, so we called Paul Cleary, the executive director at PERS. Cleary told us that based on their estimates, the cost of PERS in education for the next biennium was predicted to rise by $400 million. The state isn’t responsible for that full amount, but rather 70 percent, or $280 million -- roughly the amount the governor had mentioned in his speech.

The next step was to take the governor’s $265 million figure and divide it by the total number of students in the public K-12 system, which, by the Oregon Department of Education’s latest count, was about 560,000.

Do that and you get about $475 per student -- or just about the $500 the governor mentioned in his speech.

Now this isn’t a done deal, of course. If you take a look at the budget the governor recommended to legislators, spending on K-12 increases not by $600 million but by $400 million. The governor has a slighter increase -- and one that is largely the result of other personnel costs as well as a larger investment in education -- because he’s assuming PERS costs will be curbed by his plan to cap cost-of-living increases, among other changes.

We note that the governor’s plan has to get through the Legislature, and if approved would likely face the hurdle of litigation. Becca Uherbelau, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Education Association, which represent public employees, says the proposed reforms would wind up in court.

However, much of that has little to do with what the governor said -- and the statement we’re vetting.

Kitzhaber has said on several occasions, most recently in his State of the State address, that if nothing changes, the state will be spending about $500 more per K-12 student to cover the cost of PERS in the next biennium.

We checked his math and verified it with the executive director of PERS and the governor is right. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBEDD00>],/factchecks/2013/jan/21/john-kitzhaber/are-increased-pers-costs-responsible-500-student-i/
"['Education', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott says Florida fourth graders are world's second-best readers
","
Florida Gov. Rick Scott wants to operate every facet of state government like a business. Monitor spending. Measure performance outcomes. Compare results to competitors.

His vision for the state’s education system isn’t all that different.

""I like measurement,"" Scott said during a Jan. 15, 2013, discussion with black lawmakers. ""One positive, as you know: In the fourth grade reading, we're second to Singapore in the world, Florida students were. In math, we're above the international average. So there's some good things happening.""

His claim that Florida fourth graders are oh-so-close to being the world’s best readers piqued our interest.

Right away, we found his source: results from the latest Progress in International Reading Literacy Study.

The study is coordinated by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement and completed every five years since 2001. It examines reading achievement and habits of American fourth graders and their peers across the world. In 2011, fourth graders from 53 countries and subnational entities participated.

That year, Florida used federal grant money to be evaluated independently of the United States -- the only U.S. ""benchmarking"" state for the PIRLS exam. Florida paid $1.9 million from a federal Race to the Top grant for this assessment and two other international studies, including the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) of fourth and eighth graders.

The PIRLS results, released December 2012, surprised state officials. The average score of Florida fourth graders ranked No. 2, above the average for the United States.

""Second in the world. To be able to use those words is ... wow,"" Mary Jane Tappen, a deputy chancellor at the Florida Department of Education, told the Orlando Sentinel.

The gaps between reading scores for the highest achieving countries were not statistically significant. Florida’s score was just two points short of No. 1 Hong Kong -- not Singapore, as Scott said. Florida edged out Russia and Finland by one point, and Singapore by two points. Northern Ireland, the U.S., Croatia and Chinese Taipei were in the second highest tier of readers, followed by Ireland and England.

That’s not the only way to look at the data. Florida did finish second behind Singapore in terms of the percentage of fourth-grade students scoring in the advanced reading level (24 percent vs. 22 percent).

One measure isn’t exactly better than the other, said Martin West, associate professor at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education.""These are just slightly different ways of cutting the data and the distribution of achievement in a given system,"" West said.

The results vouch for Florida’s success in improving reading achievement in elementary grades, West said. In 1998, Florida fourth graders were well below the national reading average, but they were performing well above the national average by the late 2000s, he said.

""They made considerable progress over the course of that decade,"" West said. ""They’ve sort of held their level over the past couple of years.""

How important is the ranking? Chad Minnich, an editor at the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College, warns against considering results based on rank. A more useful takeaway, he said, is to look at the increased number of countries who scored above the test’s high international benchmark, and that Florida did very well among those.

Still, we wondered what would have been had other states been evaluated on their own. Florida’s education system has been getting a lot of accolades lately, but it’s still not in the upper echelon of states like Massachusetts, Maryland, Connecticut and New Jersey.

Most people consider the annual National Assessment of Education Progress, dubbed ""the nation’s report card,"" to be the best state-by-state measure of state education systems. The exam is given to a sample of fourth, eighth and 12th grade students every two years in reading and math.

Florida students typically perform above average on the NAEP. States including Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland -- states with vaunted education systems -- are usually top dogs.

""It’s certainly the case that based on this data from NAEP, we know that there are at least a handful of states that were they to participate, they would be likely to perform at higher levels than Florida,"" West said.

Our ruling

Scott said Florida students are second in the world in fourth grade reading, behind Singapore, and offers a study as evidence.

The study backs his claim up, to a point.

Florida students finished second in overall reading to Hong Kong, not Singapore. In the percentage of advanced readers, Florida ranked second behind Singapore.

But it’s important to note these rankings do not account for every country in the world. Or every state in the United States. In fact, Florida was the only state included in the ranking Scott cited because Florida paid to be included.

Scott would have been correct to say Florida finished second in the study, but he stretched the truth a bit when he said Florida ranked second in the world.

It would have been more accurate to say Florida ranked second among 53 education systems that were included.

We rate Scott’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8FB800>],/factchecks/2013/jan/21/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-florida-fourth-graders-are-worlds-/

Gov. Scott Walker says nearly a quarter of Wisconsin adults have some college credit but no degree
","
In his third ""state of the state"" speech, Gov. Scott Walker recounted leaving Marquette University in 1990 without a degree when he went to work full-time at the American Red Cross.

That year, Walker also was busy launching his political career with an unsuccessful bid for state Assembly in Milwaukee. He later married and had two children, thwarting his plan to ""squeeze in a course here or there and finish things off in a year or two,"" he recalled.

Twenty years later, after stints in state and county government, Walker won the governorship. And on Jan. 15, 2013, he used the ""state of the state"" speech to promote his efforts to help the University of Wisconsin System create a new online degree program for working adults seeking a less costly and faster way to finish off a degree.

It’s a program Walker has said he eventually may use to complete his own degree. Walker attended Marquette for four years and would have needed to stay at least another year to get a degree, according to a letter his 2010 campaign released.

Walker said in the speech his situation is far from unique, noting ""nearly a quarter of all adults in this state have some college credit without a degree.""

Amid the debate over workforce development and retaining college graduates, is Wisconsin home to that many people who started but did not finish college?

When asked for backup, Walker’s office pointed us to a 2011 policy brief by the private Indianapolis-based Lumina Foundation, which pushes nationally for an increase in the number of college graduates.

Of Wisconsin residents aged 25 to 64, an estimated 22.8 percent reported having some college credits but no degree, according to the group. The report is dated January 2011 and uses 2008 U.S. Census Bureau data compiled annually from the American Community Survey. (As a point of comparison, the same year, 38 percent of Wisconsin adults in that age range held at least a two-year degree, the report found.)

We confirmed the 22.8 percent figure using the Census Bureau’s ""American Fact Finder"" site.

That’s the figure Walker described as ""nearly a quarter.""

We checked for more recent numbers, from 2011, and got a very similar number: 22.5 percent.

That’s as close to one-fifth as it is to Walker’s description of ""nearly a quarter."" But still within rounding range.

The figure represents about 684,000 people reporting post-secondary credit but no college degree. Women slightly outnumbered men in the group. ""College"" includes technical schools. The Wisconsin numbers very closely mirror the situation in the United States as a whole.

The Lumina analysis cited by Walker excludes adults under 25 and those over 64.

That’s a bit at odds with Walker talking about nearly a quarter of ""all adults."" But two researchers we spoke with said it was reasonable to use that age range for the comparison being made.

Many adults under 25 are going to school, so excluding them from the analysis makes sense, said Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. And if the governor views the program as a workforce development tool, it’s fair to analyze the situation using a figure that focuses on people under 65, said Noel Radomski, managing director of the Wisconsin Center for the Advancement of Postsecondary Education.

The UW online program, which launches in fall 2013 at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, will be open to adults of any age, but the ""target market"" is clearly working-age adults who want and need a more convenient way to attain their degree, said UW System spokesman David Giroux.

Another study we examined, ""College Completion in Wisconsin: The Impact on the Workforce and The Economy,"" used the same age range as the Lumina report.

The ""College Completion"" report found that Wisconsin was second in the nation in high school completion rates, but 36th in high school graduates going straight to college.

Our rating

Touting a new flexible online option for finishing college degrees, Walker said that ""nearly a quarter of all adults in this state have some college credit without a degree.""

His cautiously worded estimate is in range, with the clarification that he meant adults under 65 and over 24. The number who have some credit is 22.5 percent in the most recent data; Walker cited a study that used 2008 data and put the number at 22.8 percent.

We rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8C4640>],/factchecks/2013/jan/21/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-nearly-quarter-wisconsin-adu/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Virginia', 'David Toscano']","
Toscano says state spending per student is down from 2008
","
House Minority Leader David Toscano called on the state government to increase funding for public schools during his Democratic response to Gov. Bob McDonnell’s State of the Commonwealth address.

""We spend less per student today than we did in 2008,"" Toscano, D-Charlottesville, said in his Jan. 9 speech.

We wondered if Toscano is right.

Carmen Bingham, Toscano’s chief of staff, told us the claim was based on a Senate Finance Committee report from November that contained a graph breaking down the state’s general fund spending on schools over 10 years. The general fund is largely supported by sales and income tax dollars and mostly used to pay for education, public safety and health programs.

Many Democrats in recent years have opposed Republican efforts to expand a small portion of the general fund used for transportation, saying that would strip money from public schools.

The graph shows that in fiscal 2008, which ended June 30 of that year, Virginia spent $4,451 per
student. During this fiscal year, the state will spend $4,286 per student from the general fund. The $165 per pupil decrease is about 3.7 percent. Adjusted for inflation, the drop is about 11.4 percent.

The drop corresponds with Virginia’s fall into the national recession midway through fiscal 2008. Revenues from the sales tax and income tax plunged and have been slow to recover. The general fund fell from $17 billion in 2008 to $14.8 billion in 2010. It has climbed back and this year is expected to hit $17.1 billion. Some of the losses in revenue were temporarily patched with stimulus money from the federal government.

The general funds going to education have followed a similar arc, although they have not returned to their level of five years ago. In 2008, $5.3 billion went to education. That dropped to $4.7 billion in 2011 and this year is budgeted at $5.2 billion.

Meanwhile, the number of students in Virginia public schools has grown by 30,000 -- from 1.19 million in 2008 to 1.22 million this school year.

The education cuts were made in state budgets that were backed by majorities of Democrats and Republicans. The cuts largely came in the way of reduced funding for support positions -- such as guidance counselors, nurses, secretaries -- and by easing some education standards that the state had taken responsibility for funding, according to the Senate Finance Committee report.  

We should note that the graph Toscano sent us does not give a complete picture of state funding for public education. It omits about $630 million each year of non-general state funds that are spent on schools each year, about three-quarters of which come from lottery profits.

We wondered whether per-student spending is still lower than the 2008 level when the total amount of state aid for schools is considered. The answer is yes.

In the 2008 school year, the state put a total $5.96 billion into education and spent an average of $5,003 per student. This school year, Virginia has budgeted $5.83 billion for schools, or an average of $4,774 per student.

All told, state funding has dropped by $229 per student since -- or 4.6 percent -- since 2008. Adjusted for inflation, the decrease is about 12.2 percent..

We should note that the state pays an total about 44 percent of public education costs. Local governments pay about 49 percent, the remaining  7 percent comes from the federal government.

Our ruling

By any measure, the state is spending less per public school student this year than it did in 2008. We rate Toscano’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8B2900>],/factchecks/2013/jan/21/david-toscano/toscano-says-state-spending-student-down-2008/
"['Environment', 'Water', 'Texas', 'Lee Leffingwell']","
Lee Leffingwell says treated wastewater put into Colorado River is of higher quality than Lake Austin
","
Austin get its water from the Colorado River and puts its treated wastewater into the river, Mayor Lee Leffingwell reminded colleagues at a Dec. 13, 2012, Austin City Council meeting.

Yuck? ""Actually, it’s not as bad as it sounds,"" Leffingwell said, ""because it’s better quality than the water we take out of Lake Austin"" for public use. ""It’s treated to a high level.""

His comparison of upstream river water to what the Austin Water Utility pours in downstream came to our attention from a skeptical Bill Bunch, executive director of the Save Our Springs Alliance.

Data analyzed by the utility, the Lower Colorado River Authority and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality delivered a mixed picture, also demonstrating there are myriad ways to gauge water quality.

The utility treats lake water to drinking-water quality at two upstream plants and has two major downstream wastewater treatment plants, Walnut Creek and South Austin Regional. At the plants, screens and other devices help remove large objects and separate out significant amounts of sludge, the utility says, with the remaining wastewater passing through aeration basins where microorganisms convert pollutants into solids that get treated as sludge at the Hornsby Bend Biosolids Management Plant. The liquid that remains gets passed to chlorine basins for disinfection, the utility says, and more filtration. Ultimately, a small amount of sulfur dioxide is added to remove the chlorine before much of the treated water is put into the river.

By email, Leffingwell aide Amy Everhart advised us that the mayor drew on the utility’s assessment that water downstream of its wastewater plants is of higher quality than water upstream, ""meaning the discharge is of better quality than the water upriver,"" she said.

By email and in telephone interviews, utility officials pointed us to how the state rates the quality of sections of the river, which is broken into a chain of lakes by dams.

According to a chart starting on Page 80 of the Texas Surface Water Quality Standards, Lake Austin and Lady Bird Lake in the city are rated as ""high"" quality segments for aquatic life, a utility assistant director, Daryl Slusher, noted, while the section below Lady Bird Lake where Austin discharges most of its wastewater is rated more highly, as ""exceptional.""

""This is one of the very rare instances where the overall water quality in a river segment downstream of a major urban area is classified as better than that of the upstream segment,"" Slusher said.

Not so fast, an Austin environmental engineer said.

Lauren Ross, recommended to us by Bunch, pointed out by email that monitoring by the Lower Colorado River Authority indicates distinct nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the river. In August 2012, for instance, the level of nitrogen at the Lake Austin dam upstream was rated ""low,"" at 0.008 milligrams per liter, while the river below Austin was rated ""high/critical"" from Webberville to La Grange, with concentrations of 2.7 mg./liter to 6.4 mg./liter. Phosphorus levels tested ""normal"" at Lake Austin but were ""high/critical"" from Webberville to Smithville and ""high"" at La Grange, according to the authority.

By telephone, Raj Bhattarai, who manages the utility’s division of environmental and regulatory services, said it’s understandable that water downstream would have higher levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, given the Austin region’s population and that nitrogen and phosphorus are components of human waste byproducts.

Ross also suggested a look at differing levels of heavy metals upstream and downstream, which she said would indicate deterioration. The utility provided a chart showing average concentrations of 11 metals in Lake Austin and near the major treatment plants. Levels of arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, silver and zinc were the same or higher downstream. Levels of cadmium, nickel and mercury were the same, while levels of barium were lower downstream.

We weren’t sure what to make of these measurements. Ross said she wasn’t prepared to say there were health effects.

We asked the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for its analysis of differences between the water upstream and water returned to the river after wastewater treatment.

By email, spokeswoman Andrea Morrow responded that agency experts consider six indicators directly comparable between water checked by the commission every few months at monitoring stations on Lady Bird Lake and Lake Austin and wastewater effluent as gauged by the Austin utility at treatment plants including the Walnut Creek and South Austin Regional facilities.

According to a chart prepared by commission staff, both the water upstream and the effluent have similar, reasonable acidity/alkalinity and dissolved levels of oxygen. The utility’s effluent is of greater clarity, the chart suggests, and has lower E. coli levels, which can indicate fecal contamination and the potential for waterborne disease.

However, the effluent has higher levels of phosphorus (as measured at two smaller plants, Morrow said) and ammonia-nitrogen, the latter of which can be toxic to aquatic life in overly high concentrations, though it typically nourishes plants and algae, Morrow said.

Among six plants where effluent has been checked for ammonia-nitrogen, average levels ranged from 0.2 milligrams per liter to 0.9 milligrams per liter compared with permitted levels of 2 or 3 milligrams per liter, varying by location. Raw lake water, upstream, averaged 0.04 milligrams per liter for ammonia-nitrogen, the chart says.

Morrow wrote: ""These are only a fraction of water quality parameters that could potentially be compared between the two water types, but the reality is that available data allows only a handful to be evaluated."" By the indicators, she summarized, ""the effluent tends to be clearer and lower in bacteria levels, while the lake water"" before it is taken in by the utility ""is generally lower in nutrient concentrations. Dissolved oxygen and pH were comparable between the two types. So with respect to the statement that the effluent quality is higher than the source water, for some things it’s true, for others it’s not.""

Ross, speaking to the commission’s chart, said the utility does not check nitrogen levels of its effluent and ""failing to monitor for wastewater effluent’s most significant contributions to stream degradation hides the true impact of Austin’s wastewater effluent on downstream water quality.""

Bhattarai said the utility measures what’s required to be measured under its state-granted permit.

By email, Slusher said the utility doesn’t disagree with the commission analysis of individual elements in the wastewater effluent, though the big picture remains, he said, that the river downstream has judged of higher quality for aquatic life than Lake Austin.

In contrast, Ross said the levels of nitrogen and phosphorus downstream signal the effluent is not of higher quality, though she also said she’s not saying that the utility is not doing a good job.

We gathered more detail.

In the last three months of 2012, the utility said by email, the effluent from the major treatment plants had about nine times the level of ammonia that Lake Austin had in late 2010, the last time the utility checked in that stretch, and more than 850 times the amount of nitrogen that Lake Austin had in 2010.

Generally, Bhattarai said, the effluent can be of better quality than Lake Austin upstream, by certain parameters at certain times, but the utility doesn’t say that is always the case.

Our ruling

Leffingwell said Austin’s treated wastewater, put into the river, is of higher quality than water the city removes upstream for public use.

Some indicators suggest the river below Austin is of higher quality for aquatic life than the water in Lake Austin, but other measurements suggest higher downstream levels of nitrogen and phosphorus.

Besides, the mayor specified that the wastewater effluent is of higher quality than water in Lake Austin. The state’s analysis was that some elements of the effluent are better, some worse, with which the utility seemed to concur. 
This claim ultimately strikes us as oversimplifying a judgment that depends on which of many possible quality indicators is considered most significant. We rate it as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8B2E80>],/factchecks/2013/jan/21/lee-leffingwell/lee-leffingwell-says-treated-wastewater-put-colora/
"['Ohio', 'History', 'Keith Faber']","
Keith Faber says Abraham Lincoln spoke in the Ohio Senate chamber and may have danced there, too
","
Abraham Lincoln was both loved and hated in his own time, but few political figures are more revered in ours.

That made him a logical reference for the newly elected president of the Ohio Senate, Keith Faber, when the 130th General Assembly met for the first time on Jan. 7.

Delivering the president's customary opening remarks, Faber, a Republican from west-central Ohio, spoke of the legislature's traditions and responsibilities and asked for a spirit of cooperation:

""Lincoln, who visited and some say even danced in this chamber, appealed in his first inaugural address to 'the better angels of our nature,'"" he said. ""I echo that call for civility today. I believe we should seek to compromise on policy but never to compromise on principle, and you will always have my profound respect for acting on conviction – knowing that at times we might disagree.""

While PolitiFact Ohio could appreciate his thoughts on civility, the historical tidbit was the music to our ears.

We knew that Lincoln danced -- he met his future wife, Mary Todd, at a cotillion in Springfield, Ill. -- and we knew he spoke at the Ohio Statehouse.

But dancing there was new to us.

It didn't take long to find supporting background, among the historical facts buried in the ""Chamber Tour"" portion of the Ohio Senate website:

""While the Ohio House of Representatives can boast that former President Abraham Lincoln spoke in the House Chamber,"" it says, ""legend has it that before he was president, Lincoln danced on the Senate floor. Some sources suggest that during Lincoln's 1859 visit to Columbus as a presidential candidate, he attended a Statehouse ball in which he shared a dance with the lovely Kate Chase, daughter of former Ohio Governor Salmon P. Chase, who would later serve in Lincoln's cabinet.""

Chase, earlier a U.S. senator and later chief justice of the United States, was Lincoln's treasury secretary and a presidential hopeful himself. His daughter Katherine was his staunchest supporter and the widower's official hostess. (We’ll also add a bonus tidbit: Chase whose face appears on the $10,000 note, is one of the three non-presidents who, along with Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin, are featured on U.S. paper currency.)

Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin tells more about the story in the magisterial biography ""Team of Rivals."" The movie ""Lincoln"" is loosely based on a portion of it.

Lincoln visited Columbus in February 1861 on the way to his March inauguration in Washington. While meeting with the governor in the Statehouse, Lincoln was notified that the votes for the Electoral College had been counted, confirming him as the next president.

Goodwin writes that Lincoln ""attended a lavish military ball, where it was said that he danced with Chase's lovely daughter, Kate, much to the irritation of Mary. The image of Lincoln dancing with the 20-year-old beauty, tall, slim, and captivating, was spoken of in hushed tones for many years afterward.

""In fact,"" Goodwin continues, ""the charismatic young belle could not have danced with Lincoln that evening, for she was absent from the city when the Lincolns arrived. In an interview with a reporter more than three decades later, Kate maintained that 'Mrs. Lincoln was piqued that I did not remain at Columbus to see her, and I have always felt that this was the chief reason why she did not like me at Washington.’""

According to the source notes for ""Team of Rivals,"" the story of the dance ""was told to the author by a tour guide at the Ohio Statehouse during a visit to Columbus in 1998.""

That puts the story solidly in the category of Statehouse lore -- a classification confirmed by the Senate website, which adds more:

""As the story goes, the dance was cut short due to a jealous Mary Todd Lincoln. However, many, many years later, Statehouse lore suggests that the two may have tried to finish their dance. At the turn of the 20th century, former Ohio Senator and Governor Joseph B. Foraker heard waltz music blaring through the locked doors of the Senate Chamber while he was working in his Senate office late one night. When he looked through the chamber window, he saw a tall, slender man with a petite woman in a Victorian-age hoop skirt. Foraker identified the pair as Lincoln and Ms. Chase, but unfortunately, no one else was there to corroborate his story.""

PolitiFact will leave ghost-hunting to others. We will presume that Lincoln did not spell out O-H-I-O with his arms, and we know that he never heard a band playing ""Hang on Sloopy"" or even ""Carmen Ohio.""

But we know that Lincoln visited the Statehouse on several occasions, and that he attended receptions and a ball.

And Faber left himself room to two-step by phrasing the claim about dancing as ""some say.""

Some do say, and not without justification, that he danced there. He didn’t dance with Kate Chase, which is a bit of lore that Faber wisely left out of his opening day remarks.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Faber’s claim rates True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC888080>],/factchecks/2013/jan/21/keith-faber/says-abraham-lincoln-spoke-ohio-senate-chamber-and/
"['Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Gov. Scott Walker says nearly everyone will pay more in federal taxes in 2013
","
Republican Gov. Scott Walker, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, frequently tweets on national political issues from @ScottKWalker.

As the fiscal cliff deal approached, Walker pleaded with Washington not to ""screw up"" the economy by letting taxes go up. He then criticized the eventual deal in a series of tweets, culminating with this bipartisan slam on Jan. 4, 2013:

""Thanks to Washington, nearly everyone will pay more in taxes in 2013. Somehow people think it’s just the wealthy. It’s not.""

Walker poked at ""Washington"" again in his Jan. 15, 2013 ""state of the state"" speech, saying federal officials were putting more money in the hands of the government, not the people.

Much of the fiscal-cliff debate, which ended in a New Year’s Day deal, focused on whether to extend the across-the-board reduction in federal income-tax rates approved in 2001 and 2003 under President George W. Bush.

Those lower rates were due to expire at the end of 2012, but the cliff deal extended them.

For almost everyone, that is.

The deal locked in the reduced Bush-era rates for taxable income up to $400,000 (single filers) or $450,000 (joint).

For the portion of a filer’s taxable income above those amounts, the tax rate will rise to 39.6 percent, the Clinton-era rate. Fewer than 1 percent of US households are expected to report taxable income above those thresholds in 2013, a Tax Policy Center study found.

The deal kicks in a few other tax increases for wealthier folks, adding to some that were approved as part of federal health care reforms.

But income-tax rates for most people will not change.

So what does Walker mean when he says, ""nearly everyone will pay more in taxes in 2013""?  

When we asked for backup, Walker campaign spokeswoman Nicole Tieman sent us a Wall Street Journal blog item on the deal’s failure to extend a different tax break -- the Social Security payroll tax holiday of 2011 and 2012.

The holiday came from President Barack Obama as a continuation of Democratic-backed measures passed in the 2009 stimulus package. It reduced the worker share of Social Security taxes taken off paychecks from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent.

For example, that gave workers making $75,000 to $100,000 an average break of $1,194 on federal taxes in 2012, another Tax Policy Center study found. The average across all income levels was $721.

In 2012, Obama initially sought to extend the payroll break again, but Republicans were split on it, and some Democrats weren’t thrilled with it either. So Obama and Congress let it die a quiet death.

Three experts told us a large share of Americans will see their taxes rise in 2013 compared to 2012 because of the disappearance of the Social Security payroll tax holiday.

Some 77 percent of all U.S. households will be paying more in taxes overall in 2013 than in 2012, almost completely because the payroll tax is returning to its old level, said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution.

William McBride, the chief economist at the business-backed Tax Foundation, told us that ""anyone with a job that pays wages is affected, so, a high percentage of the population."" He said that 83 percent of tax returns report some wages.

Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, confirmed it would hit ""every paycheck.""

So, Walker is on to something regarding the payroll tax, though Williams said ""nearly everyone"" was a bit of a reach.

There are a couple other important points to cover about Walker’s claim about the deal, formally known as The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.

Marr and Williams noted that Walker’s description is just one of the ways to look at the tax situation.

""Is it actually a tax increase, or are we just not giving you a break anymore?"" asked Williams.

Unlike the Bush-era tax cuts, which Republican sponsors tried repeatedly to make permanent, the payroll tax was designed as short-term boost to the economy, Williams said.

Marr called the Social Security tax holiday a political orphan, with neither party much interested in fighting over keeping it.

If Washington had not acted on the payroll and income tax rates,90 percent of Americans would have seen a tax increase, Williams said.

In blaming Washington for the tax increase, Walker takes into account the decision to end one break -- the Social Security payroll cut -- but does not factor in the new life that Congress and the president gave to another break, the income tax cuts that were extended for most.

Our rating

Walker tweeted, ""Thanks to Washington, nearly everyone will pay more in taxes in 2013. Somehow people think it's just the wealthy. It's not.""

From the perspective of the real net effect on people’s tax rates compared to last year in the wake of the deal, Walker’s claim about the fiscal-cliff legislation rings pretty true, depending on your definition of what constitutes ""nearly everyone.""

The expiration of the Social Security payroll tax holiday means that tax will revert to higher, pre-2011 rates for everyone who earns a paycheck, though a minority of tax filers have no wage earnings.

But he makes a glass-half-empty claim about a broad deal by viewing the result in a narrow context of one tax decision, while leaving out important information about the tax effect of another major decision that was part of the deal. It would also have the ring of truth to say that ""thanks to Washington"" a massive tax increase was averted in the same deal.

But then, he only had 140 characters to work with.

"['New Jersey', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie says state's gained 75,000 private-sector jobs since he took office
","
New Jersey’s unemployment rate continues to hover above the rest of the nation but jobs are growing in the Garden State, according to Gov. Chris Christie.

The growth is so good that Christie highlighted job gains during his State of the State address on Jan. 8.

""In total, we have added nearly 75,000 private sector jobs in New Jersey since we took office in January 2010,"" he told lawmakers in Trenton.

Christie has had a mixed bag of results from the Truth-O-Meter when it comes to claims about jobs. This time, however, he’s on target.

Let’s review the facts.

Christie became governor on Jan. 19, 2010, so we’ll measure private-sector job growth from that month, as well as February 2010 – his first full month in office. Also, since Christie gave his State of the State address on Jan. 8, we’re looking at job growth through November 2012. The December jobs numbers didn’t come out until Thursday, but we’ll note those figures later.

New Jersey had 3,203,200 jobs in January 2010 and 3,269,900 jobs in November 2012, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s a net gain of 66,700 jobs.

But Christie’s figure is on the mark if we start the jobs clock a month later.

New Jersey had 3,197,600 private-sector jobs in February 2010 and 3,269,900 jobs in November 2012, according to BLS data. That net gain is 72,300 jobs.

But 75,000 isn’t the highest private-sector jobs number that New Jersey has seen during Christie’s tenure.

In a July 2, 2012 speech to the state Legislature, where he presented his case for a tax cut, Christie said the state had added ""nearly 85,000 private-sector jobs"" since Feburary 2010.

Joseph J. Seneca, an economics professor with the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said New Jersey’s jobs losses from June through October 2012 was at odds with national job growth. October’s Hurricane Sandy resulted in more significant job losses in November, but employment started to realign in December, he said.

And seasonal hires were only part of the story for a major upswing in job growth announced Thursday: employers added 30,200 workers from across all major labor sectors to their payrolls.

Factoring in those numbers, New Jersey’s private-sector job growth from February 2010 through December 2012 is 103,200, Seneca said.

""Moving into 2013, New Jersey’s economy is poised to continue to grow,"" Seneca said. ""There are still question marks out there with the federal fiscal debt and potential government shutdown and all the drama in Washington being played out again, but the December numbers are a big relief and catch up from what had been a pretty weak prior six months, but it’s much more consistent now with what’s been happening nationally.""

Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak and Kevin Roberts did not return a request for comment.

Our ruling

Christie said during his State of the State address, ""In total, we have added nearly 75,000 private sector jobs in New Jersey since we took office in January 2010.""

If measured from January 2010, New Jersey’s job growth  through November 2012 (December jobs figures didn’t come out until Thursday) was 66,700 jobs.

Measured from February 2010 – Christie’s first full month in office – the net private-sector gains are 72,300 jobs.

The numbers only get better. After the release of December’s job figures, New Jersey’s net private-sector job growth since January 2010 is 97,600 jobs. From February 2010, it’s 103,200 jobs.

We rate the governor’s statement True.

Protect Families First claims children typically try marijuana at age 12
","Former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., recently organized a national group to oppose the legalization of marijuana. Project SAM, for Smart Approaches to Marijuana, also calls for limiting medical marijuana use to non-smoked forms of the drug.

After the launch of Project SAM, a Providence group called Protect Families First took issue with some of Kennedy’s positions.

Protect Families First, which says it supports ""progressive family values including pro-family marijuana reform,"" agreed with Kennedy on the need to increase resources for treatment of drug abuse and prevention. But the group says it supports strictly regulating, not prohibiting, marijuana use.

The organization also asserted that Kennedy’s position does not address the problem of children’s access to drugs.

In a news release issued Jan. 10 -- the same day Project SAM was announced in Denver -- Protect Families First listed several statistics, including this one: ""The average age of first marijuana use is 12, the lowest ever and still declining.""

That would mean a fair number of kids even younger than 12 are toking up. We wondered whether it was true.

We contacted Protect Families First, whose executive director, Rebecca McGoldrick, checked the information and sent an e-mail later that day saying the statement was wrong. She said a research intern had gotten confused about the numbers.

McGoldrick provided what she said were corrected statistics, citing a couple of studies. One, a national survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, an agency created by Congress in 1992 to reduce impact of substance abuse and mental illness on communities, found the average age of first use of marijuana among people ages 12 to 49 was 17.5 years of age in 2011.

Even though it was clear Protect Families First had made a mistake, we were curious enough to check a few more sources.

We examined several studies, including some that indicated an increase in marijuana use among young people over the past few years.

Monitoring the Future, a project run at the University of Michigan, has surveyed about 50,000 8th, 10th and 12th graders in the United States annually since the 1970s about various issues, including drug use. It found that more in the 2000s reported trying marijuana during middle school than in the late 1990s, but the percentages fluctuate.

In the 2010 survey, 26 percent of young people said they first smoked marijuana or hashish as high school freshmen. Second to that was the 21.6 percent who said they first smoked it in ""grade 7 or 8"" -- about ages 12 to 14.

Another report, by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stated that only 8.1 percent of students nationally first tried marijuana ""before age 13 years.""

And the Rhode Island Department of Health’s latest health risk survey, from 2011, found that 7.1 percent of Rhode Island high school students reported having tried marijuana before age 13.

Our ruling

Protect Families First said in a news release that ""the average age of first marijuana use is 12, the lowest ever and still declining,"" a statement that grabbed our attention because it seemed so unlikely.

After we called them, the organization said that figure was in error.  And none of the studies we found suggested that 12 was the average age for first marijuana use.

We rate the claim False.

Citing his accomplishments, Gov. Scott Walker says big retailer Kohl's announced 3,000 jobs
","
In his ""state of the state"" speech on Jan. 15, 2013, Gov. Scott Walker said Wisconsin is improving as a place for doing business, then boasted of a job-creation coup.

""Employers feel good about our state,"" the Republican governor said, reflecting on the first half of his four-year term. ""During the past year, Kohl’s Department Stores worked with us and announced the creation of 3,000 new jobs.""

In a state with unemployment well above 6 percent, having 3,000 jobs set to come online would be huge news. But that’s not the headline we remember.

Indeed, no ground has yet been broken on a second corporate headquarters for Kohl’s that was announced in 2012, although planning is well under way.

When it comes to employment, there are jobs and even promised jobs. Then there are potential jobs.

Saying Kohl’s ""announced the creation of 3,000 new jobs"" is different than saying Kohl expects or hopes to hire that many people.

Where does this one stand?

Growth of Kohl’s

The first Kohl’s department store opened in 1962 next to a Kohl’s grocery store in the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield. Both the department store chain and the now-defunct grocery chain were started by Max Kohl, the father of Herb Kohl, who served for 24 years as a U.S. senator from Wisconsin before deciding not to seek re-election in 2012.

Kohl’s is now a chain of more than 1,100 family-oriented department stores in 49 states, selling Jennifer Lopez, Princess Vera Wang and other lines of clothing, as well as a variety of home goods and other items. With $18.8 billion in sales in 2011, the publicly traded company -- which is no longer connected with the Kohl family -- ranked 20th on the National Retail Federation’s 2012 list of the nation’s top 100 retailers.

In December 2011, news surfaced that Menomonee Falls-based Kohl’s, which has 4,900 corporate employees in the Milwaukee area, might be close to announcing a decision on where to build a second headquarters building.

Milwaukee was competing with Menomonee Falls, its suburban neighbor, for the $250 million corporate expansion. Three months later, Kohl’s said it had decided against downtown Milwaukee and in July 2012, the company announced its chosen site in Menomonee Falls.

Walker’s evidence

When we asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie for evidence to support Walker's claim, he provided us a news article and a news release from the governor.

Like a number of other news articles during the year, the four-paragraph November 2012 news item in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said the new headquarters was expected to create 3,000 jobs over 12 years.

The Walker news release was issued on the day Kohl's announced the Menomonee Falls site. Walker said in the release that Kohl's would receive up to $62.5 million in state tax credits over 12 years, but the actual amount ""will be completely dependent upon the number of newly created jobs and the amount of Kohl’s capital expenditure.""

The state Economic Development Corp. said that under the deal, Kohl’s must retain 4,500 jobs, create 3,000 jobs and invest $250 million in new and existing facilities to get the full amount of the tax credits.

So, even news releases from Walker’s office and one of his state agencies talk about the possibility of 3,000 jobs, not a certainty that they had been or would soon be created.

Indeed, in a Milwaukee Business Journal article published the same day as Walker’s news release, Kohl’s chairman and chief executive officer Kevin Mansell said ""up to 3,000 jobs could be added"" over 12 years.

That’s a projection that, even if well founded, doesn’t amount to a commitment to create that many jobs. And there’s no way to know whether economic conditions over 12 years will enable Kohl’s to reach its hiring goal.

Our rating

Walker said that in 2012, Kohl’s Department Stores ""announced the creation of 3,000 new jobs.""

What Kohl’s announced is it would build a new headquarters and expected to create 3,000 jobs, over 12 years -- not that 3,000 jobs were a certainty.

"['Oregon', 'Education', 'Crime', 'Public Safety', 'State Budget', 'John  Kitzhaber']","
Does Oregon spend $10,000 a year per student, $30,000 per inmate?
","
In his annual address, Gov. John Kitzhaber called on lawmakers to make a range of difficult decisions in order to put more money into schools. The actions include reducing the costs of health care and corrections. State forecasters estimate the prison population will grow, in part due to tougher sentencing measures and in part due to overall population growth, at an extra cost of $600 million over the next 10 years. The governor said most of the beds will be occupied by nonviolent offenders.

Kitzhaber acknowledged that politicians don’t like to appear ""soft on crime."" But he asked them to keep two numbers in mind as they go forward.

""It costs $10,000 a year to keep a child in school; it costs $30,000 a year to keep someone in prison,"" he said. ""If we are unwilling to act on this issue, in this upcoming legislative session, we will by default be choosing prisons over schools.""

Obviously, it’s more expensive to house and feed an inmate than to teach a child. One is a round-the-clock operation; the other isn’t. But are the governor’s numbers right? Is there a 3-to-1 ratio? We figured this would be a simple check.

Right away, through the magic of the Internet, we found a news report from 2012 in The Oregonian that stated that ""the state spends an average of $30,000 a year to house, feed and care for an inmate.""

Of course, PolitiFact Oregon is all about primary sources, so we went to the Department of Corrections, where we found a quick facts page.It states that the daily cost of housing an inmate in the 2011-13 budget period is $84.81 -- which comes out to nearly $31,000 a year.

The governor’s Commission on Public Safety reports a slightly lower number still in the ballpark -- $82.48 a day or $30,105 a year. The cost is for ""security, health care, food, recidivism reduction programs like mental health and drug treatment, and other operational costs, but excludes community corrections grants, debt service, capital construction, and new prison start‐up costs.""

(The $82.48 figure is the same as in a Legislative Fiscal Office analysis of the Corrections budget, dated September 2011. What we’re trying to say is that both per day breakdowns come from the same source, the state.)

OK, one number down, another to go.

The Oregon Department of Education also has nifty numbers, including spending per pupil. In 2010-11, operational expenses were nearly $9,400 per student, statewide. (Capital spending per child was $777, but we’re going to stick with the $9,400 figure because the corrections cost does not include capital spending.)

The costs range, of course, from $27,947 apiece for 35 students in the Burnt River School District in Baker County to $5,566 in the Scio School District in Linn County. Portland Schools, the largest in the state, spends about $11,830 per student.

We should note here that prosecutors are not enthusiastic about Kitzhaber’s plans to ""reform"" public safety, and say that the Oregon’s corrections system is fine as is. John Foote, Clackamas County’s district attorney, served on the governor’s public safety commission and submitted a minority report supported by district attorneys, the association of chiefs of police and the state sheriffs’ association.

We contacted Foote. He concurs on the math, but he says Oregon is considered a high cost state, in that we don’t incarcerate a lot of people but the cost is high when we do. The obvious fix, he says, is to lower the daily cost of incarceration.

Are we very high on daily costs? That’s a perfectly fine question for another PolitiFact. In this PolitiFact, we’re checking Kitzhaber’s math.

Kitzhaber, in his State of the State speech, implored lawmakers to work with him to boost spending for children and families, including more money into classrooms. As part of that initiative, he proposed lowering costs in health care and in prisons, as well as taking a hard look at tax expenditures and public pension reform.

He asked lawmakers to keep two numbers in mind: $10,000 to keep a child in school, versus $30,000 to keep an inmate in prison. The average operational cost of educating a child is even lower, on statewide average, further underscoring his point. We rate the statement True.

PBS commentator Mark Shields says more killed by guns since '68 than in all U.S. wars
","Since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., supporters and opponents of gun control have thrown out statistics to support their point of view.

Here’s one that caught our eye, offered by liberal commentator Mark Shields on the Dec. 21, 2012, edition of the PBS NewsHour.

Shields told host Judy Woodruff, ""You know, Judy, the reality is -- and it's a terrible reality -- since Robert Kennedy died in the Ambassador Hotel on June 4, 1968, more Americans have died from gunfire than died in … all the wars of this country's history, from the Revolutionary through the Civil War, World War I, World War II, in those 43 years. ... I mean, guns are a problem. And I think they still have to be confronted.""

Is the death toll that high? Let's examine each half of his comparison.

Deaths from warfare

We found a comprehensive study of war-related deaths published by the Congressional Research Service on Feb. 26, 2010, and we supplemented that with data for deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan using the website icasualties.org. Where possible, we’ve used the broadest definition of ""death"" -- that is, all war-related deaths, not just those that occurred in combat.

Here’s a summary of deaths by major conflict:   4,435 2,260 13,283 525,000 2,446 116,516 405,399 36,574 58,220 383 2,175 4,486 1,171,177 
Another 362 deaths resulted from other conflicts since 1980, such as interventions in Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, Somalia and Haiti, but the number is not large enough to make a difference.

Gunfire deaths

The number of deaths from gunfire is a bit more complicated to total. Two Internet-accessible data sets from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention allow us to pin down the number of deaths from 1981 to 1998 and from 1999 to 2010. We’ve added FBI figures for 2011, and we offer a number for 1968 to 1980 using a conservative estimate of data we found in a graph in this 1994 paper published by the CDC.

Here is a summary. The figures below refer to total deaths caused by firearms:
  
We should note that these figures refer to all gun-fire related deaths -- not just homicides, but also suicides and accidental deaths. In 2011, about one-quarter of firearm-related deaths were homicides, according to FBI and CDC data. Using total firearm-related deaths makes the case against guns more dramatic than just using homicides alone.

When we rated a previous Facebook post, we lowered an otherwise True claim to Mostly True because it said that ""nearly 100,000 people get shot every year."" We found that the number of gun deaths and non-fatal injuries added up to 104,852, but we concluded that the term ""get shot"" could suggest victims who got shot by someone else rather than by their own hand. We don’t see a similar problem with the way Shields’ comment was phrased -- namely, ""died from gunfire."" Our ruling Since Shields’ comparison was otherwise accurate, with about 1.4 million firearm deaths to 1.2 million in war, we rated his claim True.

Facebook post says more people were murdered with knives, body parts or blunt objects than with rifles
","
Gun-rights advocates have mounted an aggressive social-media campaign to blunt the popularity of the White House’s efforts to advance new restrictions on guns.

One reader forwarded us a statistics-heavy Facebook post that echoes others we’ve received. It says, ""Facts gun control advocates don’t want you to know. According to the FBI, in 2011, 1,694 were murdered with knives, 726 with hands or feet, 496 with clubs or hammers, 323 with rifles of any type. But Obama wants to ban semi-automatic rifles?""

We should first note that there is significant disagreement over what is, or should be, considered ""an assault weapon."" For instance, even though the Facebook post references Obama’s intention to ""ban semi-automatic rifles,"" California law already includes some types of handguns and shotguns in its definition of ""assault weapon.""

That said, we’ll take a look at the number of deaths caused by rifles. To check the post, we looked at the 2011 edition of the FBI’s annual ""Crime in the United States"" report. The report breaks down the types of weapons used in murder. These are the statistics for 2011, the most recent year available: 
  
6,220 
323 
356 
97 
1,587 
1,694 
496 
728 

The Facebook post and the FBI stats are closely in tune. Except for a minor typo in the Facebook post’s number for deaths by hands, fists or feet, the numbers are accurate.

The number cited for rifles was somewhat less precise. While it’s true that the FBI counted 323 murders by rifles, the agency also counted 1,587 murders by an undetermined type of firearm and 97 by ""other guns."" If gun usage in these two categories followed the same pattern as other gun homicides, that would add another 75 or so murders by rifle, making an estimate for the number of rifle murders about 400, rather than 323.

Still, the larger point holds: Murders by knives, blunt objects and body parts each individually outweighed those committed using a rifle.

We should note that while the Facebook post’s comparison is accurate as far as it goes, it does ignore the single biggest category of weapons used in murders -- handguns. Handguns were used in 6,220 cases, or 72 percent of all firearm murders in 2011 and slightly under half of all murders using any kind of weapon that year.

This caveat illustrates how the selection and framing of statistics can be used to bolster one side or the other in the gun debate.

Our ruling

The post uses data selectively, ignoring the significant role of handguns in gun violence. But the statistics it mentions are solid. FBI data backs up the Facebook post’s claim that in 2011, more people were murdered with knives, ""hands or feet"" or ""clubs and hammers"" than with any type of rifle.

"['State Budget', 'Florida', 'Bill McCollum']","
Bill McCollum says he slashed the attorney general's budget 18 percent
","
In a spirited hour-long FOX 13 debate broadcast on Aug. 5, 2010, Republican candidates for governor Bill McCollum and Rick Scott flung a series of accusations about each others' pasts.

McCollum continued to press Scott about his time running hospital giant Columbia/HCA, saying it's hard to believe Scott didn't know the hospital chain was taking part in a massive and coordinated Medicare and Medicaid fraud scheme.

Scott, meanwhile, bashed McCollum's decades of public service, saying he voted to raise taxes and fees 42 times, and wants to create an anti-business climate if elected.

If you missed the debate, which is likely the last before the Aug. 24 primary, you can watch most of it in segments on Fox 13's website. If you don't have a hour, we'll just sum it up by saying the two men clearly don't like each other.

We plan to check a few items from the debate. In this fact check, we wanted to focus on one exchange dealing with McCollum's government credentials as the state's attorney general.

During one of the more heated moments, Scott accused McCollum of failing to control state spending.

""If you look at history, when state budgets grow versus the size of the private sector, jobs go away,"" Scott said. ""While you've been attorney general it's exploded. You've done nothing to stop it.""

""I'm going to reduce the size of government.""

McCollum responded, ""In my attorney general's office, we've cut the budget by 18 percent. I do know how to run a business. I have run the attorney general's office. It has 12 offices around the state. It has 1,400 employees.""

McCollum's facts about the offices and employees are close enough and noncontroversial (it's about 1,300 employees in 12 offices) that we're not going to check them. But we do want to explore the claim that McCollum has cut his budget 18 percent.

The governor's Office of Policy and Budget suggested we turned to the state's fiscal website, http://floridafiscalportal.state.fl.us. The site tracks budget figures by agency starting with the year 2000. For our purposes, we wanted to check the attorney general's budget figures starting in fiscal year 2006-2007, which was the budget passed the year before McCollum took office. That way, we'd track all the budget changes McCollum made.

What we found shows that the total budget for the attorney general's office actually grew since McCollum took office, from about $173 million in 2006 to about $186 million this year. That's a 7.5 percent increase, not an 18 percent cut.

We turned to the attorney general's office for an explanation.

What we got is another lesson in why government is, well, government.

(Now entering the bureaucratic mess of state budgeting.)

While the attorney general's office has a budget of $186 million, lots of that budget is carved out into pieces that head in directions outside of McCollum's control. 
McCollum's office provided us with a spreadsheet that attempts to make sense of things. Click here to read it yourself, if you can make sense of it.

Of the AG's $186 million budget, just about 20 percent comes from general revenues, and therefore is available to spent as McCollum sees fit. That money funds the statewide prosecutor, pays for criminal appellate division of the attorney general's office, funds McCollum's cyber crimes task force, etc.

The rest of the money is tied up in trust funds that have a specific purpose, and often simply pass through the attorney general's office.

A couple of examples:

The attorney general's budget this year includes almost $37 million in federal money for victims' funds. That's money allocated to states based on a federal formula and is paid out to victims of a crime. Another $14.6 million in federal dollars are allocated specifically to fight against Medicaid fraud. Under that program, for every $1 the state spends through its general revenue fund, the federal government will kick in $3.

Money to fund the Florida Elections Commission is included in McCollum's budget, though he has no control over it.

Pass-through funding, as the AG's office calls it, accounts for more than $60 million this year alone.

The rest of the attorney general's budget is paid for, ostensibly, by other state agencies who hire McCollum's lawyers. If the Department of Children and Families, for instance, pays for the equivalent of 20 lawyers, they would get 20 lawyers. If they pay for 10, they get 10. If they pay for zero, you get the point.

Excluding the pass-through trust funds and the money spent on AG lawyers by other agencies, the attorney general's operational budget shrunk from $48.6 million in 2007 to $42.9 million this year, a dip of about $5.7 million, according to the AG's office.

But we think using the 2006 number is more fair, because that accounts for any increase in the budget McCollum made in his first year in office. Using the 2006 number, $47.4 million, McCollum has trimmed the attorney general's operational budget about $4.5 million.

Translated into a percentage, that comes to about 9.5 percent.

So what gives?

(Now going deeper into the bureaucratic mess of state budgeting.)

The attorney general's most recent budget includes a special one-time $3.5 million allocation for Crime Stoppers. The money will be used to pay for enhancing public awareness of crime prevention methods and to train the public in personal safety principles. Typically Crime Stoppers had been funded by a $20 fine tacked on to criminal convictions, money that is then put into a trust fund.

But the Legislature zeroed out the trust fund to pay for other costs. So the money was reinserted into the attorney general's operational fund for 2010 only, in order to allow time for the trust fund to be rebuilt.

That shifts the budgeted amount McCollum controls down again, to $39.4 million in 2010.

That's $8 million less than what was budgeted in 2006, or a 16.9 percent decrease.

McCollum said matter-of-factly that he has cut the attorney general's budget 18 percent since he took office. The line leaves viewers, pretty clearly in our minds, the impression that McCollum cut the entire attorney general's budget. In fact, we know now, that he's just talking about a small portion of AG spending.

We acknowledge and agree that there are lots of dollars tucked in the $186 million spending plan that McCollum cannot control, and we also note that McCollum has lowered spending in the core areas of the AG's office he oversees.

But we think he missed an opportunity to be more clear with voters. We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7D92C0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/06/bill-mccollum/bill-mccollum-says-he-slashed-attorney-generals-bu/

Fact-checking the claims about 'anchor babies' and whether illegal immigrants 'drop and leave'
","
It sounds like a way for illegal immigrants to get a foothold in the United States: Pregnant women from Mexico and other countries can come to the U.S. to deliver their babies. Voila! Under the 14th Amendment, the babies are instant citizens!

That's become a popular talking point for critics of illegal immigration, who have dubbed the children ""anchor babies."" The implication often is that the baby U.S. citizens act as an anchor that that helps parents and other relatives obtain citizenship and other benefits.

Several Republican senators, including Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., John McCain, R-Ariz., Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have called for hearings on whether the 14th Amendment, which was adopted in 1868, needs to be rewritten to curb automatic ""birthright citizenship.""

The most prominent voice pushing that concept is Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who proposed amending the Constitution to make clear that babies born in the U.S. do not automatically receive American citizenship.
 
In a July 28, 2010, interview on Fox News' On the Record with Greta Van Susteren, Graham said that ""there's another problem we have in this nation that I think is novel and needs to be fixed. If you come across the border illegally and you have a child in America, automatically, that child becomes an American citizen. Under the 14th Amendment, three court cases says there's a constitutional right to that. I would like to deal with the 12 million (illegal immigrants) firmly and fairly. You can't stay here on your own terms. You have to learn English. You have to pay fines. You have to get in the back of the line if you want to be a citizen. But I may introduce a constitutional amendment that changes the rules if you have a child here. Birthright citizenship, I think, is a mistake, that we should change our Constitution and say if you come here illegally and you have a child, that child's automatically not a citizen.""
 
Later in the interview, Van Susteren asked Graham, ""How realistic is it that you will introduce a constitutional amendment?""

Graham replied that he had to because ""people come here to have babies. They come here to drop a child. It's called 'drop and leave.' To have a child in America, they cross the border, they go to the emergency room, have a child, and that child's automatically an American citizen. That shouldn't be the case. That attracts people here for all the wrong reasons.""

In a later interview with Van Susteren on Aug. 3, Graham once again referred to a ""problem where thousands of people are coming across the Arizona-Texas border for the express purpose of having a child in an American hospital so that child will become an American citizen, and they broke the law to get there."" 
We've dealt with one aspect of this issue before, when we checked a claim by Fox host Glenn Beck that ""we're the only country in the world"" that offers birthright citizenship. (We found that 33 others do, so we rated Beck's statement False.) 
This time, we were curious about Graham's statement that ""people come here to have babies. They come here to drop a child."" He portrays it as such a big phenomenon that it warrants changing the U.S. Constitution. But is the problem as big as he suggests? 
Limited benefits  
It's important to note that having an ""anchor baby"" won't do much to help a Mexican mom become a U.S. citizen. Because citizen children cannot sponsor their parents for citizenship until they turn 21 -- and because if the parents were ever illegal, they would have to return home for 10 years before applying to come in -- having a baby to secure citizenship for its parents is an extremely long-term, and uncertain, process.

However, having a citizen child can produce some short-term benefits, said Marc Rosenblum, a senior policy analyst for the Migration Policy Institute. Pregnant women and nursing mothers could be eligible for certain benefits under the Women-Infants-Children (WIC) program, which provides food and nutrition vouchers, and their children could enroll in Medicaid, although the undocumented parents could not. Having a child can also help an undocumented parent qualify for relief from deportation, but only 4,000 unauthorized immigrants can receive such status per year, and the alien has to have been in the U.S. for at least 10 years. That means very long odds, Rosenblum said. 

Most of the benefits of citizenship accrue over the much longer term. The child will be able to work here legally once he or she is old enough, said Roberto Suro, a communications and journalism professor at the University of Southern California who specializes in Hispanic issues, and when they're ready for college, they'll qualify for in-state tuition at most public colleges. ""It is a hell of a lot of deferred gratification at best,"" he said. 
Mixed evidence 
When we contacted Graham's staff, they could not provide any specific data on mothers who ""drop and leave.""  But they sent us several news accounts about the large number of undocumented immigrants who give birth to children in the United States. 
Graham is right on that point. According to a report by the Pew Hispanic Center, a think tank that has done extensive research on immigration policy, 3.8 million undocumented immigrants have at least one child who is a citizen. ""Most children of unauthorized immigrants -- 73 percent in 2008 -- are U.S. citizens by birth,"" the center says. That's up from 63 percent in 2003. 
These statistics suggest not only that the number is large, but is also growing. 
To offer a concrete example, we found a 2006 article from the Dallas Morning News about Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, a safety-net facility for poor residents. As many of 70 percent of the roughly 16,000 women giving birth annually at the hospital were immigrants who were in the U.S. illegally, according to one survey cited in the story. 
So there's ample evidence that many illegal immigrants give birth in the U.S. every year. But how many of them came to the U.S. with the motivation of giving birth and then leaving? 
In interviewing medical practitioners in states on the U.S. Mexico border, we found mixed evidence. 
James Dickson, the administrator and CEO of Copper Queen Community Hospital in Bisbee, Ariz., located five miles from the Mexico border, told us that his hospital hasn't offered obstetrical services in a few years, but when it did, he did not see anything like what Graham is describing. ""We had some"" people who came to have a baby in the U.S., he said, but their goal was not citizenship. It was higher quality treatment or specific services that were unavailable in Mexico. 
Salli Gonzalez, a nurse-midwife in Seguin, Texas, who delivers about 30 babies a year, said that in the past two years, she'd seen only one person who would fit Graham's criteria. 
On the other hand, Lauren Weber, a midwife in San Diego, said that some patients from Mexico have confided to her that they've temporarily secured a U.S. address and a utility bill, which is typically enough to qualify them for birth-related care paid by California's version of Medicaid. 
""There are a million hardworking Hispanic people in San Diego who came here to work and then happened to have a baby,"" she said. ""Then there are people who come over in order to have a baby."" She estimated that in the clinic where she works part time, a third to a quarter of her patients have come over for the express purpose of having a baby, and the rest are staying in the U.S. for the longer term, whatever their legal status may be. 
Weber also noted that she's treated wealthier patients who get the proper visas and fly to the United States to have a child. They come from such countries as China, Pakistan and India. Less affluent Filipinos have also come on tourist visas, she said, and some affluent Mexicans come to give birth as well. 
This is a pattern cited in a series of recent news accounts. One article, by the Associated Press on June 28, 2009, details a ""birth package"" offered by the Tucson Medical Center in Tucson, Ariz., to affluent Mexican women. ""This is not a new phenomena,"" the Mexican consul general in Tucson, Juan Manuel Calderon Jaimes, told the AP, saying he's seen the practice for almost 30 years. ""Many families of means in Sonora send their wives here to give birth because they have the resources to pay for the services.""

The article reported that ""expectant mothers can either schedule a Caesarean section or arrive a few weeks before their due dates to give birth at TMC. It is one of 13 packages aimed at Mexican families, some of which include a stay at a local resort and shopping excursion. Tucson Medical Center's maternity package costs $2,300 for a vaginal birth with a two-day stay and $4,600 for a Caesarean section and a four-day stay, assuming no complications.""

Another article, published in the Washington Post on July 18, 2010, featured a Shanghai-based firm that charges $14,750 for a three-month stay in a center in California. The package includes ""two months before the birth and a month after,"" according to the article. ""A room with cable TV and a wireless Internet connection, plus three meals, starts at $35 a day. The doctors and staff all speak Chinese. There are shopping and sightseeing trips. The mothers must pay their own airfare and are responsible for getting a U.S. visa, although (the firm) will help them fill out the application form."" 
In such cases, it's hard to determine whether mothers-to-be are coming to the U.S. for higher-quality medical treatment or the benefits of citizenship.

Data doesn't support Graham's claim

Immigration data and surveys don't provide much support for Graham's notion that many women are illegally crossing the border in large numbers to have children, then leaving.

First, immigration from Mexico to the U.S. tends to go up and down in tandem with the health of the economy.

According to another Pew Hispanic Center report, immigration from Mexico dropped by about one-third between 2000-2001 and 2002-2003, coinciding with the recession precipitated by the dot-com bust and the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The numbers climbed back as the economy recovered, rising close to their pre-decline numbers by 2005-2006. Then, the numbers fell again, starting in 2006-2007 (a bit before the current recession began) and have continued to fall as the economy has sputtered.

It should be noted that these are numbers for all immigrants coming from Mexico, legal and illegal combined. But Jeffrey S. Passel, a senior demographer with the Pew Hispanic Center, said that since illegal immigration historically accounts for 80 to 85 percent of all new immigration from Mexico, the trends for all immigrants tend to mirror those for illegal immigrants alone. 
""All the data suggests that people come here to work -- especially Mexicans, and especially illegal Mexicans,"" said Suro.  ""If people came here because they were looking for work, you would expect to see the flow fluctuate with employment opportunities -- and that’s what the data shows. If people came here to have babies, the flows would be pretty constant, and they are not.""

There's something else you don't see, Suro said. If having a baby was a significant driving factor in illegal immigration, you would expect to see a higher percentage of women of child-bearing age in the U.S. illegally compared to men of the same age. In fact, just the opposite is the case. Numbers from the Pew Hispanic Center show that in four separate age ranges between 20 and 40, undocumented men significantly outnumber undocumented women.

Finally, there's direct testimony from actual immigrants.

Princeton University sociologist Douglas Massey conducted in-depth interviews with 159 Latin American immigrants -- most of whom came to the U.S. illegally -- for a recent book he coauthored with Magaly Sanchez R., Brokered Boundaries:  Constructing Immigrant Identity in Anti-Immigrant Times.

When they were asked about their motivations for coming to the U.S., ""no one ever mentioned having kids in the U.S."" Massey said. ""I've been surveying Mexican immigrants to the U.S. for 30 years as part of the Mexican Migration Project. We don't ask people their reasons for migrating because most people cannot really articulate the reasons very well -- you get simple answers like, 'I came for the money,' but that doesn't tell you much because people can want money for all kinds of reasons. But we do ask about their migratory behavior, which we then link to social and economic conditions on both sides of the border. What our work shows is that migrants come in response to labor demand in the U.S. and are motivated by economic problems at home."" 
Misleading comments

Undoubtedly, citizenship plays some role in the decisions by undocumented immigrants to come to the U.S. After all, they have made a decision to make their future in the United States rather than in their home country, and part of building a better life in the U.S. is having citizenship for their children. But on Fox, Graham termed the practice ""drop and leave,"" which suggests that illegal immigrants are coming here for the primary purpose of having babies with citizenship, then rushing home to wherever they came from.

Graham's comments on this are misleading. While that does appear to be happening with affluent ""birth tourists,"" it's important to understand that those affluent ""birth tourists"" are not the ones illegally crossing the Rio Grande or the Sonoran desert. They are coming here with the proper legal papers and giving birth. Thus, whatever public policy challenges arise from ""birth tourism"" are separate and distinct from the public policy challenges of illegal immigration -- which is not at all the impression that Graham gave in his Fox appearance.

Graham tacitly acknowledged this distinction in his follow-up appearance on Van Susteren's show on Aug. 3, 2010, saying, ""You have found and I've provided you information about groups that are marketing to Chinese, and Mideastern and European families a 90-day visa package, where you come to America as a tourist. You come to a resort. You have your child at a hospital within the resort. That child is an American citizen. You turn around and leave."" But raising this example days later strikes us as an after-the-fact justification.

So let's recap.

It's true that many illegal immigrants are having children in the U.S. However, we are not convinced that ""drop and leave"" is a phenomenon. The data suggests that the motivator for illegal immigrants is the search for work and a better economic standing over the long term, not quickie citizenship for U.S.-born babies. Graham appears to be conflating two things -- a pattern of wealthy foreigners engaging in ""birth tourism"" using legal visas, and illegal immigration of poorer people from Mexico. In our view, failing to make the distinction exaggerates the alleged problem and uses inflammatory rhetoric to obscure legitimate policy questions. On balance, we rate his comment Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA17C80>],/factchecks/2010/aug/06/lindsey-graham/illegal-immigrants-anchor-babies-birthright/
"['National', 'Taxes', 'Sarah Palin']","
Sarah Palin said Democrats have no plan to extend some of the Bush tax cuts
","
Sarah Palin disagreed with the Pants on Fire rating we gave her for the statement, ""Democrats are poised now to cause this largest tax increase in U.S. history."" So she let us have it, via a note on her Facebook page.

""Yesterday, PolitiFact.com fact-checked my statement about the coming $3.8 trillion Obama tax hike – the largest tax increase in history. They did such a bad job of it, however, that I feel compelled to fact-check the fact-checkers,"" she began.

Palin, the former governor of Alaska, made several points in her rebuttal, the primary one being that the Democrats haven't put forward a plan stating how they intend to address the expiring Bush tax cuts. Palin's comments on Fox News Sunday gave the impression that Democrats want to see them all expire.

In fact, Democrats have repeatedly stated they only intend to let lower tax rates expire for individuals making more than $200,000 or couples making more than $250,000. And that's nowhere near the largest tax increase in history, as we noted in our rating.

But Palin doesn't see it that way.

""Unfortunately for PolitiFact, no such proposal exists. ... Plan? What plan? There is no plan. All we have is smoke and mirrors based on an old Obama campaign pledge that if elected, he would exempt families making less than $250,000 a year from 'any form of tax increases.' ...

""To prevent PolitiFact from making similar mistakes in future, it would be helpful if the White House and the Democratic Congressional leadership finally mustered the courage to table their plans to let the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire. Mr. President, publish your proposals, and we'll duke it out. You can argue in favor of a multi-trillion dollar tax hike in an age of economic uncertainty and mass unemployment, and we'll argue for fiscal sanity combined with serious spending cuts. I for one look forward to such a debate.""

We're not trying to antagonize Gov. Palin, but President Barack Obama has indeed published his proposals in some detail -- at least twice, in the annual budget documents that the White House releases.

The president's 2011 budget, for example, says on page 39, ""Allow the Bush Tax Cuts for Households Earning More Than $250,000 to Expire.""

""In the last Administration, those at the very top enjoyed large tax breaks and income gains while almost everyone else struggled and real income for the middle class declined. Our Nation cannot afford to continue these tax cuts, which is why the President supports allowing those tax cuts that affect families earning more than $250,000 a year to expire and committing these resources to reducing the deficit instead. This step will have no effect on the 98 percent of all households who make less than $250,000.""

Lest you think that's too general and vague, there are detailed estimates in the budget summary tables, starting on page 164, for provisions such as, ""Upper-income tax provisions devoted to deficit reduction: Expand the 28-percent rate and reinstate the 36-percent and 39.6-percent rates for those taxpayers with income over $250,000 (married) and $200,000 (single) ... Reinstate the personal exemption phaseout and limitation on itemized deductions for those taxpayers with income over $250,000 (married) and $200,000 (single) ... Impose 20-percent tax rate on capital gains and dividends for those taxpayers with income over $250,000 (married) and $200,000 (single).""

In Congress, key Democratic leaders have indicated they are using the plan outlined in the federal budget as the framework for their legislation. The Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on dealing with the expiring tax cuts. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the committee's chair, said in a July 14, 2010, statement, ""I support extending the middle-class tax cuts permanently, as soon as possible, so working families can keep more of their hard-earned money.""

The committee released a budget analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation, ""Estimated Effects on Economic Growth and Distribution."" That document showed estimates for the cost to make the Bush tax cuts permanent for those who are now taxed at rates of 10 percent, 25 percent, 28 percent, ""and part of the 33%."" That 33 percent tax bracket, by the way, includes taxpayers who make slightly below and slightly above the benchmarks Obama described.

And then there's also the U.S. Treasury Department's ""General Explanations of the Administration's Fiscal Year 2011 Revenue Proposals,"" known by policy wonks as ""the green book."" It outlines in even more detail how the Obama administration plans to increase taxes for high-earners and keep the current rates for everyone else.

""It is very much an official statement of policy. It's what they propose to do,"" said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ""Obviously, Congress will do or won't do what it will. But I have heard no one on the Hill saying we should let everything expire.""

News coverage from other publications from The Wall Street Journal to our fellow fact-checkers at Factcheck.org have also noted the Democratic proposals and ideas on these issues.

""The Democrats' plan seems to me to be quite explicit: keep the tax cuts for those under $250,000 and let those for the rich expire,"" said Norman Ornstein, resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, and a longtime watcher of Congress. ""Does that mean never, ever taxing the under-$250 (thousand) populace? No. But it is a straightforward policy plan.""

Palin does make a good point that there is not pending legislation to make some parts of the Bush tax cuts permanent. Certainly, lots of unexpected and surprising things can happen when Congress actually begins to take up legislation. It's possible that Congress could become entirely gridlocked. If no legislation passes, the Bush tax cuts will indeed expire for all incomes.

And, she's also right that on the campaign trail Obama promised not to raise ""any"" taxes on a family making less than $250,000. We rated that Promise Broken after Obama signed laws increasing taxes on cigarettes and indoor tanning. There is also the controversial tax penalty in the new health care law that will tax those who don't have insurance, starting in 2014. Yet Obama also promised to extend the Bush tax cuts for lower incomes and let the Bush tax cuts expire for higher incomes. Those two promises are both rated In the Works. (See all of Obama's tax promises.)

But Palin was distorting the facts when she said, ""All we have is smoke and mirrors based on an old Obama campaign pledge."" There is much more than that in the public record from both President Obama and Democrats in Congress. Frankly, we anticipated criticism when we published our  report on Palin, but we were not anticipating the criticism that the Democrats are hiding their intentions on tax rates for people of lower incomes, or the claim that Obama has not published fairly detailed outlines of what he intends for the tax code. There is a plan, and you can see it on pages 39 and 164-165 of the budget. We rate Palin's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB9E6FC0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/06/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-said-democrats-have-no-plan-extend-som/
"['Ohio', 'Elections', 'Lee Fisher']","
Lee Fisher accuses Rob Portman of taking big contributions from ‘Big Oil’
","""Big Oil"" is emerging as the Halliburton of the Democrats’ 2010 campaigns, a convenient villain that conjures images of spoiled beaches and oil-covered birds. And since a BP deep-water well in the Gulf of Mexico began spewing crude after an April 20 explosion, ""Big Oil"" has become a synonym for ""big industry that needs a whipping.""

That’s why Lee Fisher, the Ohio lieutenant governor running for U.S. Senate, is highlighting the ""Big Oil"" campaign donations that his opponent, Rob Portman, has received. Fisher, a Democrat, wants BP to pay for all damages and losses, and he suggests that Portman prefers lenience for BP. By noting the money the Republican’s campaign has received, Fisher implies that Portman will do BP’s bidding.

In a June 16 statement, the Fisher campaign said: ""To date, Congressman Rob Portman, who spent 20 years in Washington and has taken more than $125,000 from Big Oil for his Senate campaign, has remained silent on the BP spill, the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history.""

There are legitimate differences between the two candidates, and at the time Fisher’s campaign issued this statement, Portman’s views on BP weren’t known. But Portman subsequently told Ron Ponder, a Canton-area radio host, on June 30 that ""I agree that they are responsible. I agree they ought to be paying not just for cleanup but for the economic damage that's been done.""

Still, Fisher’s statement on Portman’s silence appeared to be accurate when the claim was made. But what of the other part of the claim? Has Portman taken at least $125,000 from the oil industry?  

We checked first with CQMoneyLine, which sorts contribution information that the campaigns report to the Federal Election Commission. CQMoneyLine data shows that political action committees representing the energy and natural resources industries have donated $122,400 to Portman’s campaign. That’s awfully close to $125,000 -- but the individual contributions within that category include companies that are not in the oil or even natural gas exploration businesses.

Several of those donations came from utility companies including the PACs of FirstEnergy Corp. and American Electric Power. Call them Big Electricity, but don’t call them Big Oil. Other donations came from PACs for nuclear energy, coal and even copper mining interests. So those should be taken out. In the spirit of generosity, we’ll leave in PAC contributions from firms such as Koch Industries and Halliburton, which conduct an array of oil and non-oil businesses, and we’ll even leave in those from natural gas companies that have only a small portion of their business in oil exploration or production.

Even so, we found that at least $46,000 of that $122,400 had nothing to do with ""Big Oil.""

That didn’t make Fisher wrong, however, because other groups aggregate the data differently and CQMoneyLine only measured PAC contributions, excluding donations from individuals who work for oil and gas companies. So we turned to the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent group that tracks campaign contributions. That’s where the Fisher campaign says it got its figure, in fact. The center’s website, www.opensecrets.org, puts Portman’s current political take from the oil and gas industries at $132,008.

The figure is higher than Fisher’s claim of $125,000 because the data has been updated since the Fisher campaign first made the statement, according to a Fisher spokesman. An even higher figure for the oil and gas will probably emerge as new FEC filings are tallied.

We wanted to drill down further, so the center gave us more detailed  information than it has on its website, and we did some additional checking of lobbying records and original FEC filings from the Portman campaign.

It appeared that Fisher’s claim about the sum of Portman’s ""Big Oil"" claim was largely correct. We then took out the PAC contributions of companies like Koch and Halliburton, since those companies engage in other businesses as well as oil, just to see how the numbers would change. That took us to $122,008, which is pretty close to Fisher’s $125,000 claim. But there are two caveats:

Holly Benson claims Florida leads the country in automobile accident fraud
","
Fraud was a hot topic during the July 31, 2010, debate between Pam Bondi, Jeff Kottkamp and Holly Benson, all Republican candidates for Florida attorney general. 
At one point, Bay News 9 anchor and debate co-host Al Ruechel asked, ""Why is it that Florida is so ripe for all sorts of fraud? Mortgage fraud, Medicaid fraud, and what can the AG's (Attorney General) office do to cut that down?"" 
Benson was the last candidate to answer the question, beginning her response by saying, ""You know, even yesterday I read that Florida is now the number one state in the country for automobile accident fraud."" She then returned to Medicaid and went on to say that she would put in place ""laws with teeth"" so that the ""bad guys would get put away"" and that they wouldn't be able to use Medicaid as a money-making scheme. 
We've heard a lot about mortgage and Medicaid fraud, but not so much about automobile accident fraud, so we decided to look into it.    

Benson's office sent us a link to an article published by the South Florida Sun Sentinel, on May 11, 2010. The article points to a May 2010 report from the National Insurance Crime Bureau, which describes itself as a ""leading not-for-profit organization exclusively dedicated to preventing, detecting and defeating insurance fraud and vehicle theft."" Nearly 1,100 property and casualty insurance companies and self-insured organizations support the NICB, according to the group's website.

The NICB report says that questionable claims involving possible staged accidents increased 46 percent from 2007 through 2009. Broken down by state, Florida leads the pack, with 3,006 questionable claims submitted. New York came in second, with 1,680 claims. On a city level, New York City was the clear winner -- 1,304 questionable claims were submitted by NICB's insurance members between 2007 and 2009. Tampa was second with 562 claims submitted during the same time period.

Right away, we notice that the NICB report that Benson's campaign seems to be relying on is not a ranking of the number of auto insurance fraud convictions by state. As Frank Scafidi, director of public affairs for the NICB, explained to us in an e-mail, ""Our staged accident reports ... are based on the voluntary submission, or referral, of insurance claims deemed 'questionable' by the companies handling them. These are claims that are suspicious and may contain some indication of potential fraud so companies can elect to refer them to us for further review and investigation."" 
Just because a claim is submitted as questionable, however, does not necessarily indicate that fraud occurred. 
""The mere referral of a claim in no way deems it fraudulent and many questionable claims turn out to be perfectly legitimate,"" Scafidi said. 
Unfortunately, NICB was unable to provide us with the number of questionable claims that turned out to be legitimate.

We also contacted the Insurance Research Council, an industry-backed group that provides ""timely and reliable empirical research to all parties involved in public policy issues affecting risk and insurance."" David Corum, the group's vice president, told us that the organization conducted its own analysis of auto insurance fraud. 
The report, published in November 2008, looked at more than 42,000 claims submitted by 22 insurance companies that represented 57 percent of the U.S. private passenger market in 2006. The claims were reviewed for evidence of either fraud or buildup. The group defines fraud as a ""specific material misrepresentation of the facts of a loss."" Buildup, on the other hand, sometimes also referred to as soft fraud, is defined ""as the inflation of an otherwise legitimate claim."" The report found that Florida led the country both in terms of the number of claims suspected of fraud and buildup. More specifically, 22 percent of bodily injury claims submitted in Florida involved apparent fraud and 41 percent involved apparent buildup. Among Florida personal injury protection claims, the apparent fraud rate was 10 percent, and the rate of apparent buildup was 30 percent. 

Finally, we spoke with James Quiggle, director of communications for the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, a nonprofit anti-fraud watchdog group. He told us that ""Florida is arguably the nation's epicenter of counterfeit crashes, the eye of the no-fault hurricane."" Still, as the organization's own website points out, ""no single national agency gathers omnibus fraud statistics. Insurance fraud data thus are relatively piecemeal, making our understanding of insurance fraud an ongoing work in progress.""

To recap. Benson claimed that Florida is now the No. 1 state in the country for automobile accident fraud. We spoke with industry experts and reviewed existing literature on the topic, and found that she was largely correct. Data from both the National Insurance Crime Bureau and the Insurance Research Council show that Florida had the biggest number of claims that either the insurance companies or independent reviewers found of questionable legitimacy. Still, those figures only represent likely or potential fraud, not confirmed cases of fraud.

YouTube video purporting to show Obama admitting he is not a U.S. citizen far from the truth
","Forget a birth certificate from Hawaii. Forget the fact that two Hawaiian newspapers published notices of his birth from 1961. A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll released Aug. 4, on Obama's 49th birthday, found that 27 percent of Americans still think Barack Obama was probably or definitely not born in the United States.

So what should we make of an e-mail that sends readers to a YouTube video in which Obama blandly states that he was born in Kenya?

""Obama admits he is not a citizen -- read before this is pulled,"" the e-mail says. ""Unbelievable!!!!!"" ""Why has he not been impeached?"" ""The amazing part of this travesty is Americans continue allowing themselves to be ruled by an illegal alien.""

The 11-minute video, which has been online since May 2, is titled ""Not Natural Born -- TRUTH MATTERS."" It starts with a 30-second clip of Obama speaking before a group of adults. It begins in mid-sentence: "" . . . that maybe I'm not an American citizen. Some people said he has a forged birth certificate. Well, first of all, it's true I'm not an American. I was not born in Hawaii. I wasn't born in the United States of America. I come from Kenya.""

If you listen closely, you can hear bad editing. The volume and sound quality of his voice change at key points, such as between ""it's true I'm not"" and ""an American."" The video never shows his lips where he makes his key admissions, so you can't see if his lips are in sync with what he's saying. And his audience offers no reaction to what should be a stunning admission.

So where did that portion of the video come from? The logo at the bottom of the video reads obamasnippets.com, which takes you to a YouTube humor channel that features seven videos in which Obama's words have been edited for laughs.

One example is the ""Obama DRUNK!"" video, where his comments have been slowed to make it sound as if he's intoxicated and hitting on an audience member.

The YouTube channel makes the intent clear: ""This is not 'political.' This is just for fun. This is not an 'Anti-Obama' site. This is not a 'Pro-Obama' site. This is an 'Obama Humor' site. . . . All Snippets made with 100% Obama's voice. No imitations! (That would be too easy.)""

The video in which Obama is heard saying ""I'm not an American,"" called ""Birthers' Delight - Part 1,"" includes a disclaimer indicating that it's a spoof.

The ""Truth Matters"" video has stripped away the disclaimer and added background music, perhaps in an attempt to disguise the telltale signs of editing.

There's one other indication that the Obama ""confession"" is a hoax. Some anti-Obama sites that have posted the video have included a description beginning, ""This video starts out with some content from obamasnippets.com, which, of course is contrived."" But on the YouTube page, the word ""contrived"" is not visible, unless a viewer opens the full description box.

However, nothing in the video itself warns viewers that the Obama clip is fabricated and the video includes a photo -- proven fake more than a year ago by our friends at Snopes.com -- of Obama holding a landline telephone receiver upside down.

By Aug. 4, 2010, the Truth Matters video had been viewed over a million times on YouTube, 176 times more often than the original ObamaSnippets.com video, where its humorous nature is clear.

Truth does matter, but not to the makers of the Truth Matters video or to the creators of the ""Obama admits"" e-mail.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'Michael Bloomberg']","
 Bloomberg claims Canada allows far more work visas than the U.S.
","
Immigration has become a hot-button issue this year and politicians are complaining that the United States has outdated laws and weak enforcement of border security. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg took up the debate on NBC's Meet the Press on Aug. 1, 2010, arguing that the U.S. should seek immigrants with valuable work skills.

""You have to give visas for the skills we need,"" Bloomberg said. ""Canada sets aside 36 percent of their visas for people with skills they think their country needs. We set aside 6 percent. We educate the doctors and then don't give them a green card.""

Since we don't often hear about Canada's immigration policies, we decided to dig in and see if he was right.

But before we get into the numbers, we should point out some important differences between immigration policies in the United States and Canada.

The U.S. gives highest priority to family members of citizens and immigrants with work permits (which are often known as green cards) under the philosophy that immigrants with family members in the U.S. are more easily integrated into American society. Over two-thirds of all immigrants enter the U.S. through family reunification. Humanitarian protection and employment-based immigration account for the other third of legal immigration.

Canada's system, on the other hand, takes a different approach. Although it permits immigration through family reunification and humanitarian protection channels, it primarily relies on a point system to determine who will be permitted through economic channels.

The point system is designed to encourage immigration by those who seem likely to make the greatest contribution to the Canadian economy. The system awards points based on criteria such as level of education, languages spoken, occupation and whether or not the immigrant has relatives in Canada. Only candidates with enough points can apply for a Canadian work visa.

So at the outset, the two systems were set up for very different purposes -- and encourage very different types of immigration. With that in mind, let's dig into the figures.

There is no limit to the number of people who can immigrate to the U.S. through the family reunification process, as long as the immigrant's application is sponsored by a citizen. Employment-based immigration, on the other hand, is capped at 140,000 per year. Because employment-sponsored immigrants can also immigrate with spouses and children, only about 40 percent of those 140,000 visas go to workers themselves; the other 60 percent go to dependents.

In the U.S., annual limits and caps on specific types of immigration were established in the 1990 Immigration Act, but there is no overall number limiting total immigration into the U.S. each year. Because there's no total cap on the number of visas available, it's impossible to say that 6 percent of visas are ""set aside."" There is no U.S. law that sets aside 6 percent of the annual flow of immigrants for skilled workers; rather, Department of Homeland Security data shows that most years about 6 percent of U.S. immigrants are sponsored by U.S. employers.

Bloomberg's office told us the numbers come from a book published by the Brookings Institution that said 6.5 percent of immigrants came on employment visas. But we find that Bloomberg misspoke when he said that 6 percent of visas are set aside. While there is a cap on visas for economic immigrants or skilled workers, the cap is not a percentage.

Canada, by contrast, does not cap job-related immigration. Instead, it sets annual ""targets,"" which are given as a range. In 2009, for example, the government hoped that between 156,300 and 166,800 skilled workers would become Canadian permanent residents. Bloomberg's assertion that any Canadian visas are ""set aside"" is incorrect.

When we crunched the actual data from 2009 (not the limits or targets), we found that 63,997 Canadian immigrants came as principle workers and accounted for 25.4 percent of the total 252,124 who became Canadian permanent residents in 2009, well below the 36 percent Bloomberg cited.

Bloomberg's figure for Canada may have come from a single category of economic immigrants, ""Skilled Workers,"" which, if dependents are included, accounted for 38 percent of all immigrants. If it did, he was comparing a small subsection of Canadian economic immigrants, including dependents, and the entire category of U.S. economic immigrants, not including dependents. That, in our view, is an apples to oranges comparison.

So let's recap. While Bloomberg correctly noted an interesting disparity between Canadian and U.S. immigration policies, his facts are off. First, he says that the U.S. and Canada both set aside certain percentages of their visas. But only the U.S. limits visas for specific types of immigrants, and it does so with a number, not a percentage as he claims. And there is no ""set aside"" as Bloomberg says. We find the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB7A140>],/factchecks/2010/aug/05/michael-bloomberg/bloomberg-claims-canada-allows-far-more-work-visas/

Sharron Angle blames Harry Reid for Nevada economic woes
","
Attack ads abound in the lively race between Republican Sharron Angle and Majority Leader Harry Reid for Nevada’s senate seat. Despite Reid’s barrage of heavily-funded attack ads this summer, Angle has held her own in the polls and managed to put out a few zingers herself.

Her latest ad responded to Reid’s claims that ""No One Can Do More"" for Nevada. Speaking on camera to a group of elderly supporters, Angle asserted, ""Harry Reid says he does more for Nevada. He's done more for unemployment. We were at 4.4 percent. Now we're at 14 percent. He's done more for the foreclosure rate. We have the highest foreclosure rate in the nation. He's done more for bankruptcy. We have the highest bankruptcy rate in the nation. Harry Reid has done more, and it’s time for us to say stop doing it. We can’t stand any more.""

We wondered just how bad things had gotten in the Silver State, so we decided to check the facts.

Easiest to check was Angle’s claim that Nevada has the highest bankruptcy rate in the nation. Unfortunately for the state, at a per capita bankruptcy rate of 11.7 percent, Nevada is at the top of the charts, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.

Angle was also correct that Nevada has the highest foreclosure rate in the nation. One Nevadan out of 23 was in foreclosure this year -- a rate of 4.34 percent. Nationally, only 2.7 percent of  homeowners were in foreclosure, according to data from RealtyTrac, which monitors foreclosure filings across the nation. The agency did note, however, that Nevada’s filings for the first six months of 2010 decreased by 13 percent compared with the last six months of 2009.

Angle was correct that Nevada’s unemployment rate for May 2010 was 14 percent, it’s unclear what time period she’s referring to when she said ""We were at 4.4 percent."" We did a little digging, and discovered she was referring to January 2007, when Reid became the Senate Majority Leader, and that was, indeed, the unemployment rate. But if she was trying to talk about the effect Reid himself had on Nevada’s unemployment rate, it might have been more accurate to compare today’s unemployment rates with those of 1987 -- when Reid first took office and the rate was 6.1. Instead, she chose to compare one of the lowest unemployment rates during Reid’s tenure to the highest.

Although her numbers are on-target, they don’t tell the whole story. For one thing, the state’s foreclosure and bankruptcy rates are beginning to improve. Many experts attribute Nevada’s high unemployment rate to the recession -- not to Reid, since the state’s largest industries have been hurt nationwide by the economic downturn.

""Nevada has been hit extremely hard as the recession has spread throughout the economy...Clearly, with its historical reliance on gaming and construction as engines of growth, Nevada has been at the epicenter of the current economic downturn, as these two sectors have each felt the brunt of negative economic forces,"" said a Nevada Department of Employment, Training, and Rehabilitation press release.

In any case, it’s up to voters to determine how much impact any one Senator has had on his state’s bankruptcy, foreclosure, and unemployment rates -- even if that Senator is the Majority Leader.

Angle has quoted her figures correctly, but there’s more to the story than her ad implies. She cherry-picked numbers for one claim, comparing past unemployment rates in Nevada to the current rate. And she forcefully attributes Nevada’s woes to Reid -- while his responsibility is unclear at best. We’ll rate this one Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA656C0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/05/sharron-angle/sharron-angle-blames-harry-reid-nevada-economic-wo/
"['Ohio', 'Federal Budget', 'Voting Record', ""Bill O'Neill""]","
Bill O'Neill accuses Rep. Steve LaTourette of trying to raise federal spending by 551.6 percent
","
To err once is human. To err repeatedly is just not good.

Thus, the tale of Bill O’Neill, a Democratic congressional candidate who wants to unseat longtime incumbent Steve LaTourette in Ohio’s 14th Congressional District.

O’Neill, a former state appeals judge, is unlikely to win a majority of the conservative vote in this race. He acknowledged to the Portage County Tea Party that he shares few of its political positions. But he doesn’t want LaTourette, a Republican, to get the Tea Party’s support either.

So O’Neill wrote to the Portage County Tea Party on July 30 (and released the letter to the press), saying that LaTourette misled the organization. LaTourette had told the group July 6 that his legislative agenda paralleled the Tea Party’s, but that’s demonstrably untrue, O’Neill wrote. O’Neill cited some examples in the letter, the most damning being this:

""In recent years, Rep. LaTourette has sponsored legislation that would increase spending by 551.6 percent.""

That’s an enormous increase, especially if you consider that the government spends trillions of dollars a year.  

But O’Neill’s letter stated it as a fact, without saying where that figure came from.

So we asked O’Neill’s communications director, Eric Rosso, about it – and the
problems began cascading from there.
   
Rosso pointed us to a New York Times article and chart published Feb. 13, 2005. The article was about the Republican revolution of 1994, when the GOP won control of the House of Representative and promised a smaller government. But the GOP cost-cutters had lost their way, according to the Times, which cited an analysis showing that the Republicans had become big spenders.
   
The analysis was done by the National Taxpayers Union, a nonprofit group that favors smaller government and lower taxes, and according to the Times, it showed congressional proposals for new spending during the 2003-2004 term. According to the chart in the Times, LaTourette had sponsored or co-sponsored bills during that term that would add $551.6 billion in new annual spending.
   
Notice the dollar sign?
   
We did, although you’d have to look at the top of the Times’ chart to be sure. But O’Neill missed it, calling the purported increase a hike of 551.6 percent.
   
This was just the start of his error, although it was a doozy, because the difference between $551.6 billion and 551.6 percent is enormous.
   
""That would be the equivalent of a $10 trillion a year spending increase,""  explained Pete Sepp, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation.
   
Still, even $551.6 billion in new annual spending sounded like a lot of money. Was LaTourette really proposing hikes of that magnitude?
   
No, it turns out. Which brings us to error No. 2.
         
As we researched this, we asked Rosso if he was sure about the Times chart and whether it was really measuring dollars, not percentages. He looked, saw that error, and soon contacted the Portage County Tea Party, he says, to tell it that O'Neill’s letter should have said that LaTourette added  $551.6 billion in new spending, not 551.6 percent.
   
But O’Neill’s letter actually should have said neither.
            
To understand, it helps to know where these figures come from.

The National Taxpayers Union estimates how much each piece of legislation will drive up or bring down annual federal spending using data from the Congressional Budget Office, from bill sponsors, from outside studies and other sources it deems credible. The taxpayers group then creates a cost-and-savings list for each member of Congress, based on the member's sponsorship or co-sponsorship of bills.

But there were two problems with the $551.6 billion figure that appeared in the Times. First, it was based on an interim study, covering only the first 18 months of the 2003-2004 term. It was the best available data when the Taxpayers Union put it out and the Times used it, says Sepp. But later that year, a more detailed analysis was completed and the figures changed.

LaTourette's total for 2003 and 2004 went down to a comparatively small $150.2 billion. We spotted that quickly when looking at the taxpayer group's online database.

How could the estimate have gone down so dramatically, from $551 billion to $150 billion?  

We spent a day going over the numbers and, thanks to the National Taxpayers Union staff, it finally made sense. The group revised its cost estimate downward after being convinced that a single, particularly expensive bill -- one that LaTourette co-sponsored -- would not cost nearly as much as originally thought.
            
The bill, the MediKids Health Insurance Act, would have provided health care coverage for children ineligible for other programs. It was sponsored by California Democrat Pete Stark, but he had 84 co-sponsors.  The bill never got far.
         
The National Taxpayers Union initially estimated the bill would cost $477.8 billion a year, based on information from the bill’s sponsor and Census data. But it later revised the cost dramatically, reducing it to $74.7 billion a year, after it was presented with new information and a study from Emory University.

This revision, which dropped LaTourette's total considerably, occurred in 2005. That’s a full five years ago, for those of you who are counting.

This change in arithmetic would have jumped out at O'Neill or his staff had they looked at the data underlying their claim.

So as a percentage, how much higher would LaTourette's proposals have pushed federal spending?

Using government spending data for 2004, we calculate 6.5 percent. That’s 6.5 percent, not 551.6 percent. And it could be even smaller because of some projected budget offsets that the taxpayers group does not consider in its calculations, saying they're not reliable.

If you go to the taxpayers group’s website, you’ll still find some extremely high figures that make LaTourette look like a profligate spender: $536.8 billion that he purportedly proposed in 2003 alone, and $784.7 billion in new spending during the 2001-2002 congressional session. Yet those figures are incorrect. The National Taxpayers Union agrees with us on that.

Both figures included the enormously high -- and ultimately abandoned --  projections for the proposed MediKids program. During that 2001-2002 cycle, in fact, the taxpayers group initially estimated MediKids -- which LaTourette supported -- would add  a whopping $700 billion a year in new spending. Although the Taxpayers Union never went back to take out that figure, Sepp acknowledges that it should be scaled way, way back.
        
So O’Neill’s claim of 551.6 percent is way off. He’s guilty of not just sloppy math, but shallow and incomplete research. It’s not 551.6 percent, it’s more like 6.5 percent. 
That’s so far off that we need to set the meter ablaze. Pants on Fire!

Obama's stimulus hasn't helped Georgia, GOP says
","
President Barack Obama rarely comes to Georgia, so when he arrived in Atlanta on Monday for two events, the Republican Party wanted to make sure everyone here was aware of the problems it has with his economic policies.

""Since the stimulus was passed, Georgia has lost over 124,000 jobs and the unemployment rate has risen from 8.7 percent to 10 percent,"" Republican National Committee spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg wrote in a statement.

AJC Politifact Georgia had some questions about the statement and contacted the Georgia Republican Party because it appeared on the state party's Web site. The party forwarded us some comments from Henneberg that highlighted its larger point about Obama: The stimulus package he signed in February 2009, a month into his presidency, has been a dud, according to the GOP.

""With an unemployment rate far above what the White House claimed we would ever reach with the stimulus, and with Georgia continuing to shed jobs even since last August, there is simply no way to argue that the stimulus is working,"" Henneberg wrote.

We looked at the numbers to see whether Henneberg's numbers were correct. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, slightly more than 4.8 million Georgians were in the labor force in February 2009. By June 2010, there were slightly less than 4.7 million Georgians in the labor force, the data show. The decrease was slightly more than 124,000 workers.

According to the BLS data, the unemployment rate in Georgia in February 2009 was 8.7 percent. In June 2010 -- the latest numbers available --  it was 10 percent.

In both areas, the RNC's numbers are accurate.

But some economists say there's a larger point to make. They argue that job losses and unemployment would have been higher without the stimulus.

Jeff Humphreys, a well-known economist at the University of Georgia, thinks the RNC's numbers do not tell ""the full story.""

Humphreys, director of UGA's Selig Center for Economic Growth, said the stimulus helped counter the lack of growth in the private sector. Mark Vitner, managing director and a senior economist for Wells Fargo, agrees that the job losses would have been greater if the stimulus hadn't been approved.

Both men agree the stimulus could have done more for Georgia. They say more money should have been allocated for infrastructure projects that would create jobs, such as building new roads and bridges.

""It takes longer to do infrastructure, but in my mind, it would had been an acceptable trade-off,"" Humphreys said.

It appears Georgia has a mitigating factor in regards to how the stimulus has helped unemployed residents. A USA Today analysis reported Wednesday found states with higher unemployment rates received less stimulus money per capita than states with lower unemployment rates.

Georgia, the analysis shows, was tied with Kentucky and North Carolina for having the 14th-highest unemployment rate in the nation. Georgia, meanwhile, received $1,353 per person in stimulus money, USA Today reported. Only three states (Florida, Texas and Virginia) received less money per person, the newspaper found.

Vitner, who recently completed a report on Georgia's economy, said the Peach State's primary problem in this recession is the glut of vacant housing; some of it never sold, some it was lost in foreclosure. Aside from first-time home buyer credits, there are few silver bullets for Georgia, he said.

""Georgia hasn't really benefited that much from the stimulus,"" Vitner said.

Georgia's unemployment rate peaked in February and March at 10.5 percent, according to BLS data, and it has dropped each consecutive month. A comparison of monthly unemployment data in 2010 with 2009 shows Georgia's labor force declined at a slower rate than a similar comparison of monthly data between 2009 and 2008.

Interestingly, Georgia's unemployment rate saw its greatest 12-month increase in the past 10 years from February 2008, when it was 5.2 percent, to February 2009, when it was 8.7 percent. In February 2008, Congress approved and then President George W. Bush signed into law the first stimulus package.

So is it fair to reach the conclusion in the RNC statement by solely focusing on the 2009 stimulus? The RNC said yes, directing us to comments the president made in an interview with NBC News.

""That's my job -- as president -- is to take responsibility for moving us in the right direction [on the economy],"" Obama is quoted as saying.

Obama also said in the interview that the Bush administration created policies that put the nation into a recession.

So where does that leave us?

The RNC's numbers are correct, but a closer look at all of the data shows Georgia's unemployment woes would have been worse without the stimulus. The USA Today report shows Georgia may not be getting its fair share in stimulus funds. It seems there are some mitigating factors to consider when looking at the RNC's statement.

Rick Perry says violence from Mexico reaching El Paso, with bullets flying and bombs exploding
","
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who has called for President Barack Obama to dispatch more troops to the Texas-Mexico border, told a national TV audience last week that violence in Mexico has seeped into El Paso, across the Rio Grande from troubled Ciudad Juarez. 
""You’ve got bullets hitting the city hall in El Paso,"" Perry said in a July 28 interview with Greta Van Susteren of the Fox News Channel. ""You’ve got bombs exploding in El Paso."" 
Two days later, Perry spoke in a similar vein during a visit to Laredo. ""When a car bomb goes off in El Paso ... we know there's a (security) problem,"" said Perry, according to KGNS-TV, a Laredo station. 
The threat of border spillover violence is a simmering topic. In June, for instance, PolitiFact Texas found Barely True U.S. Sen. John Cornyn's statement that spillover violence was ""real and escalating."" 
But bullets and bombs in El Paso? 
Indeed, bullets fired on the Mexico side of the border struck El Paso City Hall on June 29. According to the El Paso Police Department, one bullet traveled through a ninth-floor window and an interior wall before lodging in a picture frame. Stucco walls of the government building were struck by an additional six rounds, the police said. Nobody in El Paso was hurt. 
""Investigators believe that the rounds may be related to (a shooting incident) that occurred in Juarez,"" a police department press release said. ""El Paso City Hall does not appear to be the specific target of these rounds."" Darrel Petry, spokesman for the department, told us the Juarez incident involved an attack on Mexican federal agents. 
We asked Petry if, as Perry says, bombs are exploding in El Paso. Petry replied: ""I am not aware of any bomb going off in El Paso."" If that had happened, he said, ""I think I would have put the press release out."" 
Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger, responding to our request for information, said in an e-mail that violence in northern Mexico has continued to escalate ""and presents a clear and present threat to border communities."" She noted that, in the interview with Van Susteren, Perry also mentioned the assassination of a Tamaulipas gubernatorial candidate this summer. Rodolfo Torre Cantu was shot and killed near the airport in that state's capital, Ciudad Victoria, about 200 miles from the Texas border city of Brownsville. 
As for bombs, Perry ""also made reference to a car bomb that was detonated by cartel members a few weeks ago in Juarez just across from El Paso,"" Cesinger said. On July 15, a car bomb was set off in Ciudad Juarez's downtown, killing several people. 
The Associated Press quoted authorities saying the July 15 explosion was in retaliation for the arrest of a top leader of the La Linea gang, which works for the Juarez drug cartel. The bomb, which blew up a parked car, was described by the AP as bringing ""a new dimension of terror"" to the Mexican drug wars. The Washington Post reported: ""The assailants drew police and medical workers to the scene by leaving a bound, wounded man in a police uniform near an intersection and then calling in a false report that an officer had been shot."" The Post and other news outlets said the bomb was then set off by a cell-phone signal. 
The Juarez-based U.S. consulate's office closed July 30 ""to review its security posture,"" according to a message posted online by the office. ""American citizens are advised avoid the area around the Consulate General until it reopens."" In March, a consulate employee and her husband were gunned down as they drove in their car about a block from the U.S.-Mexican border bridge on a major Juarez thoroughfare. 
All in all, Perry’s correct that bullets coming from across the border hit El Paso’s seat of city government. No bombs have exploded in El Paso, however, though one went off in Juarez.

Langevin says each dollar spent on unemployment benefits puts $1.90 into the economy
","
We all know that unemployment benefits help people in need, but most of us don't think of them as a boost to the economy. After all, it costs the government money to cut those checks, and it's not obvious how that expense comes back to benefit taxpayers.

So it caught our attention when U.S. Rep. James Langevin declared during an online chat on ProJo.com that the economy reaps big benefits for every dollar paid out in unemployment benefits.

""Extending these benefits not only helps those who are in difficult straits because they lost jobs through no fault of their own, but it is also one of the best ways to stimulate our economy. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that for every $1 we spend on unemployment benefits, $1.90 is put into our economy,"" he said.

Unemployment benefits turn every dollar into $1.90?

It's not Rumpelstiltskinesque, but even Wall Street scam artist Bernie Madoff wasn't promising that kind of investment return.

Hoping to find a way to tap into this grow-your-bankroll phenomenon without risking jail time, we started asking questions.

Our first stop was the source cited by Langevin, the January 2010 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office called ""Policies for Increasing Economic Growth and Employment in 2010 and 2011."" It looked at a variety of strategies for increasing employment and raising the gross domestic product (GDP), which is the market value of all goods and services that reach the consumer.

That's where we discovered that Langevin wasn't telling the full story. The $1.90 figure is the budget office's high estimate. The report includes a much lower estimate as well: 70 cents.

If it cost us $1 to add only 70 cents to the GDP, does that mean we risk losing 30 cents for every dollar we spend on unemployment?

As we discovered from talking to a couple of economists, that's not what the numbers mean and spending money on unemployment benefits in the current economic situation isn't as dumb as the numbers might look to those of us who struggle to balance our checkbooks.

Here's why.

When you give $1 to people who have lost their jobs and they have run out of savings, those dollars get spent. So Mary gives it to Mike down the street to buy some of his fruits and vegetables. Mike, who relies on customers like Mary, might put 25 cents in the bank but use the rest to buy seed and fertilizer from Tom's store in town. Tom might save a dime of the 75 cents he got from Mike but use the remaining 60 cents for a new pair of glasses.

When economists calculate the gross domestic product, they add up all those transactions (excluding the amount set aside in savings and money that ends up overseas if you  buy foreign goods). In this limited example, Mary's $1 has added $2.35 ($1 plus 75 cents plus 60 cents) to the gross domestic product. Yes, it's still just $1, but by passing it along it has helped three people.

This may seem like a strange way of looking at things until you imagine the opposite situation, where the economy goes bad and we stop paying unemployment benefits.

When Mary can't afford to buy anything, Mike loses business, which affects his ability to pay Tom. As the impact ripples through the economy on a larger scale, unemployment spreads. Tax revenues evaporate. Governments must cut services, raise taxes and/or borrow money. That can mean more unemployment, less non-tax money for people to spend and higher government debt, like the kind you would incur if you decided to pay more unemployment benefits.

The Congressional Budget Office report looked at a variety of strategies to boost the economy -- or to keep things from getting worse -- such as investing in infrastructure, reducing income taxes in 2011 or cutting payroll taxes for companies that hire new people. Increasing aid to the unemployed offered the biggest bang for the buck, according to its estimates.

David Weil, a professor of economics at Brown University who explained the CBO numbers to us, stressed that this isn't always a good idea. It doesn't work when the economy is robust and unemployment is low.

""If the CBO re-ran this analysis at a boom time, those numbers would be much smaller and they might be zero,"" he said, ""and spending all that money would give you inflation and not higher output."" The strategy works best when the people who are receiving the unemployment checks have to spend every government dollar they receive, and spend it on things that help underemployed workers and underutilized factories. That keeps the system flowing.

It's true that the government has to borrow money (adding to the national debt) to make this work, Weil said. ""Someday your kids or grandkids are going to be paying back that debt. We don't know whether it's going to look like the 1950s and '60s, when we grew out of the debt from World War II in a relatively painless fashion, or whether it's going to look like Greece.""

All of this is not without controversy. Other economists have their doubts about the ability to reliably gauge this so-called ""multiplier effect,"" doubts that PolitiFact.com discussed when it examined a similar statement by New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.

Nonetheless, the idea of converting $1 into $1.90 worth of economic growth, especially over the six-year period from 2010 through 2015, isn't as completely magical or illogical as it might seem. But, as with most things economic, there's a lot of uncertainty in the estimated benefit, an uncertainty that Langevin didn't convey.

His spokeswoman, Joy Fox, said, ""I would change his statement going forward to 'up to $1.90' or 'between 70 cents and $1.90 goes back into the economy.' ""

She also cited other studies where economists have offered very specific numbers that are closer to the $1.90 CBO estimate. For example, Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics and a former adviser to John McCain during his 2008 presidential run, puts the benefit at $1.61.

We're always wary of numbers that sound very precise when a lot of estimates and assumptions go into generating them. Langevin should be too, which is why, for the sake of full disclosure, we wish he had given voters a better sense that $1.90 was just the highest estimated benefit for every $1 that is being spent on their behalf.

So the Truth-O-Meter gives him a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE4D1C0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/05/james-langevin/langevin-says-each-dollar-spent-unemployment-benef/
"['National', 'Taxes', 'Sarah Palin']","
Sarah Palin said Democrats are planning ""the largest tax increase in U.S. history""
","
Sarah Palin said she wrote her notes on her hand so the ""liberals"" couldn't say she got her numbers wrong when she appeared on Fox News Sunday. Well, we're independent fact-checkers, and we still found accuracy issues with the former governor's statements on the expiring Bush tax cuts.

""Let's turn to the Bush tax cuts, which are also becoming a big issue, the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy,"" said host Chris Wallace. ""The Obama White House is now saying end the tax cuts. And these are the tax cuts for the top 2 percent of all households in America. You can save $678 billion, and it won't hurt the recovery. Governor, if you're serious, as you say you are, about the deficit, don't you have to do something?""

""To reduce deficit spending and our enormous debt, you rein in spending,"" Palin replied. ""You cut the budget. You don't take more from the private sector and grow government with it. ... The Obama administration and the Democrats in Congress -- they're all wet on this idea. It's idiotic to think about increasing taxes at a time like this.""

Wallace: "" But you know, they would argue, 'Look, the economy did just fine during the Clinton years. The rates on the top 2 percent would be restored to what they were during the Clinton years.' The Republicans keep talking about being deficit hawks. This is $678 billion you're not going to pay for. They're saying you're being hypocritical. I say 'you' -- I'm talking about Republicans.""

Palin: ""Yeah. No, this is going to result in the largest tax increase in U.S. history. And again, it's idiotic. And my palm isn't large enough to have written all my notes down on what this tax increase will result in. Let me just go through a couple of things that I want people to be aware of, because, you know, the spin coming from Gibbs and the White House -- you're never going to get the truth out of their messaging. But Democrats are poised now to cause this largest tax increase in U.S. history. It's a tax increase of $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years, and it will have an effect on every single American who pays an income tax. Small businesses especially will be hit hardest. ..."" 
Wallace: ""Can I just ask you, what do you have written on your hand?"" 
Palin: ""$3.8 trillion, next 10 years, so I didn't say 3.7 and then get dinged, you know, by the liberals saying I didn't know what I was talking about."" (Read the complete exchange.) 
What caught our attention for fact-checking purposes was her claim that the Democratic plan would result in ""the largest tax increase in history.""

Wallace's question was about letting the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy expire. President Barack Obama's plan would increase income taxes for individuals making more than $200,000 and for couples making more than $250,000, with indexing for inflation. Wallace mentions that the Republican proposal to retain the tax cuts for the wealthy is ""$678 billion you're not going to pay for."" That's a reasonable estimate of how much increasing taxes on top earners would generate over 10 years.

Palin, however, responded as if the Democrats intend to allow all the Bush tax cuts to expire for everyone. If that were to happen, it would increase tax revenues by approximately $3.8 trillion over ten years.

But that's not what Democrats are proposing; they want to leave tax rates untouched for people who make less. We've looked for a Democrat who supports letting all the Bush tax cuts expire, and we haven't been able to find one. (And in fact, the most notable person we've found who advocates letting them all expire is Alan Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve from 1987 to 2006. He said it would help bring down the deficit.) In fact, a handful of Democrats in Congress have supported keeping tax rates for the wealthy lower, too.

But, to be clear, the tax cuts passed during the Bush administration do expire at the end of 2010. So if Congress doesn't act, taxes will go up for most people. The reason the tax cuts have expiration dates is because they were passed via a procedure known as reconciliation, which only requires 50 votes in the Senate. At the time, members of Congress hesitated to make them permanent for fear of deficits.

So Palin is confusing the issue here by using numbers that assume all the tax cuts are going away. That is not the Democratic plan nor is it President Obama's plan.

Now, let's look at the potential tax increases in comparison with other tax increases throughout history. Economists like to do this by calculating tax increases as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product, or GDP. GDP means a country's entire annual economic economic output; it's a way of measuring the entire economy. If we calculate tax increases as a percentage of GDP, it means we don't have to worry about distortions from variables like inflation or economic growth.

The most prominent study of tax increases and tax cuts over time was done by the U.S. Treasury Department, ""Revenue Effects of Major Tax Bills."" It calculated the size of all major tax provisions from 1940 to 2006 by calculating them as a percentage of GDP. 
There are no formal congressional proposals yet to keep the Bush tax cuts in place, so we don't have precise estimates from official sources like the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Still, there's a good bit of consensus on what the tax increases would look like, both if lower rates expired only for high earners and also for all incomes. Wallace's number of $678 billion over 10 years is reasonable for high earners, and Palin's estimate of $3.8 trillion over 10 years is within a reasonable range, if you're talking about all taxpayers. (We've also seen estimates of $3.7 trillion and $3.2 trillion.)

We ran the number with some help from tax experts and found that if only the tax cuts for high earners expire, the resulting tax increases would not be the largest in history. Tax increases for high earners would be roughly 0.4 percent of GDP in the first year they take effect. That's significantly less than a 1982 tax increase signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. The tax increase resulting from the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 came to 1.23 percent of GDP when the tax changes were fully implemented, four years after the law's passage.

If you let all the Bush tax cuts expire, the tax increase would come to just above 2.2 percent of GDP. Clearly, that would be larger than the Reagan tax hike of 1982. But it would be smaller than one of the tax increases passed during World War II -- the Revenue Act of 1942, which is estimated at 5.04 percent of GDP.

But again, letting all the tax cuts expire isn't the plan the Democrats are proposing, and it's not what Wallace asked Palin.

Palin said, ""Democrats are poised now to cause this largest tax increase in U.S. history."" She was asked about tax cuts for the top 2 percent. Either Palin is confused about the revenue numbers involved with extending the tax cuts, or she's willfully distorting the Democratic plans. We'll let you be the judge of that. Regardless, Wallace was very specific about asking her about tax increases for the top 2 percent. And that does not represent the largest tax increase in history. The unlikely outcome that she seems to be talking about -- that all of the Bush tax cuts will be repealed -- wouldn't be the largest tax increase in history either. Palin read the number on her hand correctly, but that's about all she got right. So we rate her statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC82B40>],/factchecks/2010/aug/04/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-said-democrats-planning-largest-tax/

Lawmaker claims Democrats want to hit small businesses with tax increases
","
We're in the middle of a recession, but Democrats want to raise taxes on small businesses. At least, that's become a popular conservative talking point as Congress gets ready to consider the Bush-era tax cuts set to expire at the end of 2010. Rep. Randy Neugebauer, a Texas Republican, repeated the charge in a July 29, 2010 blog post on Townhall.com, a popular online forum for conservative editorials.

""With 9.5 percent of the population unemployed, these higher taxes would come at a time when taxpayers can least afford it. The threat of the largest tax hike in history is creating widespread uncertainty for small businesses that could otherwise be creating jobs and expanding. After all, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 94 percent of small businesses will face higher taxes under the Democrats' plan. If their taxes are going to be higher, business owners are going to hold off on hiring and expansions. The unknowns for small businesses are simply taxing the certainty out of our economy,"" Neugebauer wrote.

We were suspicious that taxes would increase for so many small businesses, so we decided to look into it.

Neugebauer's office sent us a copy of a report issued by the Republican staff from the Congressional Committee on Ways & Means. The document, entitled ""Democrats' Ticking Tax Bomb, Part I"", states that ""starting January 1, 2011 -- less than six months from now -- an unprecedented, $3.8 trillion tax increase is scheduled to kick in, affecting every American who pays income taxes."" At the bottom of the first page is a reference to the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan tax policy and revenue estimating resource for Congress. JCT estimated that in 2007, 94 percent of U.S. businesses were S corporations, partnerships, or sole proprietorships, which means that the business owners pay taxes at the individual tax rates, the document states.

We first wanted to confirm that in 2007, 94 percent of businesses were S corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships. Indeed, in 2007, the last year for which data is available, there were a total of 32,087,881 businesses, according to data collected by the Internal Revenue Service. In the same year, there were also 3,989,893 S-corporations, 3,096,334 partnerships, and 23,122,698 nonfarm sole proprietorships. Do the math, and you get a little over 94 percent.

But that's just about the only part of the statement that's accurate.

It is true that if Congress takes no action, taxes will go up for every single tax bracket starting Jan. 1, 2011. If we assume that reporting income from an S corporation, a partnership, or a sole proprietorship means that one is a small business owner (more on that later), then 94 percent of ""small businesses"" will face tax increases. But there are multiple problems with such an assessment.

First, Neugebauer's statement makes it seem as though the ""Democratic plan"" is to let all of the tax cuts expire. That is not the case. As we previously pointed out, Democratic officials have consistently said that they intend to let only the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals lapse. The cutoff they usually suggest is $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for married couples filing jointly. President Barack Obama's 2011 budget proposal sets the cutoff at $195,550 for individuals and $237,300 for married couples. In case you're wondering about the discrepancy, the $200,000/$250,000 figures reflect income in 2009 dollars (i.e. not adjusted for inflation in 2011) before deductions and personal exemptions.

What impact would raising taxes on the top two income brackets have on small businesses? According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the same source that Neugebauer cited in his blog post, ""In 2011 just under 750,000 taxpayers with net positive business income...will have marginal rates of 36 or 39.6 percent under the president's proposal."" That translates into only 3 percent of all taxpayers with positive business income. Yes, you read that right. Only 3 percent of all taxpayers who reported having positive business income will see their taxes go up under the proposed Democratic initiative.

We also consulted experts at the Tax Policy Center, a joint project from the liberal-to-centrist-leaning Brookings Institute and the liberal Urban Institute. James Nunns, a researcher at the Urban Institute, directed us to the center's July 2010 analysis of the distribution of business income by statutory marginal rate for the year 2011. The report assumes that Congress goes through with its plan to only increase taxes on individuals making over $200,000 and couples with over $250,000 in income. It turns out, 774,000 tax filers in the top two brackets --the only ones that will see a tax increase -- will have positive business income. Divide that by the roughly 36 million tax filers who report business income (positive or negative), and you get 2.1 percent. In other words, still assuming that having any amount of income from a small business means that you are actually a business owner (big assumption), only about 2.1 percent of businesses will face the prospect of higher taxes based on the Democratic proposal.

Finally, as we suggested earlier, reporting income from an S-corporation or a partnership does not necessarily confer the title of small business owner. Anyone who earns money from a source other than a regular job -- for instance consulting or public speaking -- may report it as income from an S-corporation. So too might those who make most of their income from partnerships, such as law firms and medical practices. And it could include investors who have little involvement in the day-to-day operations of a company.

Consider that, in the highest income tax bracket, the average income of filers who report having some income from business is $718,827. In fact, the TPC analysis shows that in the second-highest tax bracket, only 26.2 percent of the tax filers reported that at least 50 percent of their income actually came from the business. In the highest bracket, the percentage is 32.5.

Neugebauer said that ""94 percent of small businesses will face higher taxes under the Democrats plan."" The statement is problematic in several ways. First, it implicitly assumes that the Democratic plan is to let all of the tax cuts lapse, when, in fact, Democratic officials have consistently said that they intend to raise taxes only for the wealthiest individuals. Second, two independent studies that looked at the impact of the Democratic proposal on small businesses found that only between 2 to 3 percent of tax filers who report having what can be thought of as small business income will be affected. One of those studies came from the very source that Neugebauer incorrectly cited. Finally, reporting business income doesn't equal owning a small business, and data from the Tax Policy Center confirm that in the top tax bracket, only about a third of the tax filers report having at least 50 percent of their income from a business. We looked and looked for a shred of truth and couldn't find one, so we rate this Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EADF47C0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/04/randy-neugebauer/lawmaker-claims-democrats-want-hit-small-businesse/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Ethics', 'Florida', 'Jeff Greene']","
Jeff Greene's Cuba trip ... business or pleasure?
","
Jeff Greene says one of his political idols was the first U.S. senator he remembers while growing up in Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy.

Well, like Kennedy, Greene's got a Cuba problem.

The billionaire candidate running as a Democrat for U.S. Senate got into trouble on Aug. 1, 2010, when he was forced to answer questions about why his 145-foot-yacht Summerwind docked in a Havana marina in 2007.

Knowing that Cuba travel is a delicate issue in South Florida Cuban American communities, we decided to review Greene's statements on the matter.

Our tool for this analysis is the Flip-O-Meter, which measures how consistent a candidate has been.

Aug. 1, 2010, debate

In a televised debate with Bay News 9 in Tampa Bay and CFN 13 in Orlando taped on Aug. 1 and aired the next night, Greene said he stood firmly in support of the U.S. embargo of Cuba.

The statement gave opponent U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek an opportunity to bring up a recent St. Petersburg Times story that said Greene went on his yacht to Cuba, and that crew members recalled extensive partying. Greene said he wasn't there. (Watch the entire exchange here).

""I don't know if I need to slide my chair over, because a bolt of lightning may come in and hit Jeff,'' Meek said. ""You're saying you weren't on your yacht, when it went to Cuba and eyewitnesses said you were on the yacht?""

""No,"" Greene responded. ""I went to Cuba years ago on a Jewish mission to Cuba, yes, for the Jewish community.""

""Were you on the yacht when it was reported …"" Meek pressed.

""No, not that time … I was not on the yacht on the trip you're talking about. I was on the yacht on another time when I had a visa to go there and visit the Jewish community,"" Greene stammered as Meek cross-examined him.

To recap the exchange, Greene said that he wasn't on the boat during the trip mentioned in the story (the 2007 ""party"" trip) but that he did visit Cuba another time, had a visa and did humanitarian work in the Jewish community. We'll call that version No. 1.

Hours later

Immediately after the debate, Greene acknowledged he may have gone to Cuba in 2007. Greene said the Jewish Federation had obtained a visa for him to visit Cuba, the St. Petersburg Times reported, and that he and other members of the federation visited a synagogue. No partying though. ""Who would you party with?"" he quipped.

Recapping Greene's revised recollection, the 2007 trip that Greene said he wasn't on, he now says he may have been on. But there was no partying, and Greene was there on a humanitarian mission to visit the country's Jewish synagogues. Let's call that version No. 2.

Later in the week

On Aug. 3, as more questions kept coming about the Cuba trip, the partying -- a deck hand reported the boat being ""caked"" in vomit from all the partying -- and Greene's humanitarian mission, spokesman Luis Vizcaino clarified that Greene's yacht stopped at a Havana marina in 2007 not for a party, and not for a humanitarian mission, but because the Summerwind was in need of repairs.

""During the debate Jeff misspoke,"" Vizcaino said. ""What he meant to say was that in 2007, he went on the boat from Honduras to the Bahamas, and en route the boat had a hydraulic problem. … The captain said we could wait for the part at Hemingway Marina.""

While docked in Havana, Greene went to visit a synagogue because he had heard about a Jewish humanitarian mission. ""He didn't meet up with them,"" Vizcaino said. ""He wanted to observe. … What he came away with was firsthand knowledge of the plight of the country.""

Vizcaino, when asked about the Jewish Federation visa, said of Greene, ""again, he misspoke."" The Greene campaign produced a letter from the Summerwind's chief engineer corroborating the campaign's latest thoughts -- the boat malfunctioned on the way to the Bahamas, went to see a Cuban synagogue while we waited -- which we're calling version No. 3. Another crew member disputes that version of events in comments to the St. Petersburg Times.

We should also note that the Greene press release on Aug. 4 attempting to clarify the trip said that ""Jeff and his then-fiancee, now wife, were en route to Honduras,"" which means headed to Honduras, which is the opposite of what Greene, Vizcaino and the chief engineer say happened.

That's at least three significantly different versions of one story, crafted in three days.

First Greene wasn't on the trip, then he said he was -- but that it was a humanitarian trip. Then the trip was a detour because of hydraulic issues.  Our definition of a Full Flop is ""A major reversal of position; a complete flip-flop."" In this case, that sounds just right. We rate Greene's statements on whether and why he went to Cuba a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA0E900>],/factchecks/2010/aug/04/jeff-greene/jeff-greenes-cuba-trip-business-or-pleasure/

Ted Strickland boasts Ohio’s small business climate is tops in Midwest
","
In the race for governor, the story of the state’s attractiveness to business is a tale of two Ohios. In Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland’s version, the state’s tax laws, location and workforce make it appealing, especially to small businesses. In Kasich’s narrative, Ohio’s tax system and regulations are driving away all businesses.

Each cites different studies to help make his case. 
""In 2009, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council ranked Ohio 11th in the nation and 1st in the Midwest for overall business climate,"" the governor said in a July 17 news release. We decided to take a closer look. 
Strickland, who made the statement in response to a Kasich ad that blamed the governor for Ohio’s jobs losses, was referring to a December 2009 study entitled ""Small Business Survival Index 2009: Ranking the Policy Environment for Entrepreneurship Across the Nation."" The study was produced by the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, or SBE, a trade group that represents small businesses and advocates for less government regulation.

The 2009 study -- the SBE’s 14th survival index -- is a more objective look than say, surveys of CEOs or other business professionals, which do not rely on hard numbers. The SBE rankings evaluate states in 36 categories, including corporate and income  taxes, gas and diesel taxes, government spending, health care and energy costs, inheritance taxes, and workers compensation costs. Business and tax experts agree that these are among key factors business owners and entrepreneurs examine when considering where to locate.

Ohio does rank 11th overall in the 2009 SBE index. But whether Ohio is No. 1 in the Midwest depends on how you define the Midwest.

Strickland relies on the Ohio Business Development Coalition, which supports the state’s economic development efforts. In a news release, it defines the Midwest as Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota.

The U.S. Census Bureau defines the Midwest differently. It doesn’t include Kentucky, which lands in the South, but it adds Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota.

Ohio still beats them all -- except South Dakota. While Ohio is more likely to compete with nearby states, the Mount Rushmore State’s ranking tops SBE’s entire survey. One reason: South Dakota is among a handful of states without a personal income tax. Small business operators find that attractive because, as the SBE and other groups often point out, about 90 percent of them file taxes as individuals -- sole proprietorships, partnerships and S-Corps -- and don’t pay corporate income taxes.

Strickland’s critics like to cite the personal income tax rate, which is high compared to about half of the other states. The conservative Tax Foundation, which Kasich frequently points to, and others say Ohio’s personal income tax, coupled with local taxes, makes the overall tax burden unattractive to business. The Federation of Tax Administrators’ tally of total state and local tax burden ranks 29 states better than Ohio.

But the Federation of Tax Administrators warns that state and local tax burden calculations don’t tell the whole story of any business climate. In Ohio, for example, tax reforms begun in 2005 replaced the corporate franchise tax with an activity tax, a move that has made Ohio more attractive to businesses.

""What would make that a bad tax would be an increase in its rate,"" says Thomas Zaino, a tax attorney and Gov. Bob Taft’s state tax commissioner who helped lead the tax reform.  ""Where Ohio’s tax system is out of kilter with other states is with personal income tax, which includes both state and local and school income tax. We are way out of line.""

This brings us back the 2009 SBE survey.

It looked at Ohio’s top personal income tax rate at the time of 5.925 percent. And it considers both personal and corporate taxes and other categories that reflect the state’s larger narrative about business climate. So while Strickland may overstate Ohio’s Midwest ranking, his claim about the SBE’s rankings is on point and the SBE’s methodology reflects the larger context of the tax debate.

We rate Strickland’s claim Mostly True.

Charles Schumer says Supreme Court Justices back campaign disclosure
","
While lamenting the fact that the vote to break the filibuster against the DISCLOSE Act would fail, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-NY, made some interesting claims about campaign finance disclosure and the Supreme Court.

Schumer's bill, the Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light On Spending in Elections Act, would, among other things, mandate disclosure of expenditures by corporations and unions that fund ads targeted at political campaigns. That includes ads that explicitly urge a vote for or against a candidate, as well as ads targeted to voters aired shortly before an election that only mention a candidate. The bill also prohibits any spending on elections by large government contractors as well as corporations that received TARP funds. The bill stalled July 27 when no Republican would join the Democrats to break the filibuster.

""Eight of the nine justices in the Supreme Court decision said that, not only is it constitutional for Congress to require disclosure of the special interest money, but they recommended we do it,"" said Schumer in a press conference shortly before the failed cloture vote on Tuesday, July 27.

We were curious whether eight out of nine justices had really spoken so highly of disclosure requirements and if they had in fact ""recommended"" that Congress require disclosure.

Schumer's comments referred to the Supreme Court opinions in the landmark case Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court struck down much of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law and went even further by saying that companies and unions could use money from their general treasury funds to finance ads in the run-up to federal elections that might be viewed as electioneering. Companies still cannot donate to candidates running for federal office, but they can create and buy time for ads attacking or supporting candidates.

However, in the majority opinion, the Supreme Court upheld the disclosure aspects of McCain-Feingold. The four justices listed in the dissenting opinion disagreed with every aspect of the majority opinion, except on disclosure. When it comes to disclosure, eight justices seem to agree that disclosure is a good thing. Clarence Thomas was the lone justice to argue that even the disclosure aspects of the law are unconstitutional.

So eight out of nine justices indicated that certain types of disclosure are constitutional. But did they ""recommend"" that Congress require disclosure?

The Supreme Court typically doesn't recommend that Congress pass a law, and this case is no exception. Nowhere in the majority or the dissenting opinion does any justice advocate that Congress pass a specific law. However, ""the Supreme Court clearly looks favorably upon disclosure, although not necessarily the disclosure provisions contained in this bill,"" said Sean Parnell, president of the Center for Competitive Politics, a group opposed to campaign finance restrictions and deeply critical of the Schumer's bill. ""The question surrounding the DISCLOSE Act is just how much disclosure (is acceptable), and in what specific form that disclosure can or cannot take place.""

In the Citizens United decision, the Supreme Court specifically upheld the disclosure requirements of McCain-Feingold. Until Citizens United, many other types of political financing were illegal, so disclosure requirements were beside the point. One aspect of the DISCLOSE Act is an attempt to require disclosure for these newly legal political finance activities.

Rick Hasen, a professor at Loyola Law School who writes a prominent blog on election law, said he believes that most, if not all, of the disclosure provisions in Schumer's bill would be welcomed by the Supreme Court. He pointed out some key passages in Justice Kennedy's ""Opinion of the Court:""

""A campaign finance system that pairs corporate independent expenditures with effective disclosure has not existed before today... With the advent of the Internet, prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable for their positions and supporters.""

Hasen said that he would view that, and the longer paragraph from which it came, as a recommendation. Hasen is in favor of the disclosure provisions of the DISCLOSE Act.

One caveat to Schumer's claim is that just because the Supreme Court justices are in favor of disclosure does not mean that they would favor the DISCLOSE Act. The Supreme Court might decide the disclosure provisions go too far or disagree with other provisions that go beyond disclosure requirements.

""Very clearly the Supreme Court approves of and thinks that there is value to disclosure, which is entirely different from whether they would endorse the DISCLOSE act,"" said Parnell.

The bill, for instance, would not allow companies bailed out by the government, such as General Motors, to donate money to political campaigns. ""Those provisions are not like the disclosure laws,"" said Hasen.
