Stewart is close in describing Kaine's opposition to Trump
","Corey Stewart, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate, rarely misses a chance to link himself to President Donald Trump. On the flip side, Stewart seldom misses an opportunity to paint Sen. Tim Kaine - the Democratic incumbent - as an unflagging enemy of the president. ""He opposes everything President Trump does"" Stewart said during a July 21 debate with Kaine in Hot Springs, Va.  ""He’s automatically going to vote against anything the president does."" Three other times during the debate, Stewart repeated that Kaine never supports the president. We decided to test the claim. His campaign did not respond to our request for backup information. So we turned to FiveThirtyEight, a much-quoted website that collects and analyzes statistics on politics, sports and other topics. The site keeps records of each congress member’s presidential support - the percentage of times a congress member votes in support of the president when the White House has taken a clear position on legislation. The website identifies 76 bills and resolutions on which Trump stated a position since Jan. 12, 2017 - eight days before his inauguration. Kaine cast 26 votes backing Trump and 50 votes against him. That comes to 34.2 percent support. But there are some caveats to that figure. Let’s take a deeper look. Nominations Kaine, during the debate, didn’t put up a fight when Stewart said he ""opposes everything"" Trump does. His response: ""I have voted for many of President’s nominees,  and I work with them everyday."" For sure, Kaine’s agreement percentage has been buoyed by his votes for Trump nominees to certain cabinet and administrative posts. Fifteen of Kaine’s 26 votes backing Trump have been to confirm nominations. But it also should be noted that Kaine has voted against 15 Trump nominees, including U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. Kaine said Gorsuch was an ""activist"" for restricting women’s health rights. Kaine voted against confirming nine of the 15 current members of Trump’s cabinet: •Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos; •Attorney General Jeff Sessions; •Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar; •Secretary of Treasury Tom Mnuchin; •Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson; •Secretary of Energy Rick Perry; •Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen; •Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta; and •Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Policy If we scratch confirmations from the list, we’re left with 46 policy votes on which Trump took a stand. Kaine voted with the president on 11 occasions, or 24 percent of the time. But that doesn’t mean Kaine agreed with Trump on 11 issues. Boiled down, they were only in sync on five matters: •Avoiding or ending government shutdowns. Kaine backed the president six times on contested votes to keep the government funded; •Disaster relief.  Kaine and Trump agreed on two measures that gave aid to victims of Hurricane Harvey, centered in Houston, and Hurricane Harvey, centered in Puerto Rico; •Expanding veterans access to private-sector health care at government expense; •Ending some regulations on small banks that were passed during the Great Recession; and •Continuance of a spying program that allows intelligence analysts to search, without warrant, communications between Americans and people identified as foreign threats living overseas. Conversely, Kaine has voted against the president’s policies 35 times, or 76 percent of the time. He has opposed, often repeatedly, most of Trump’s signature initiatives. For example, Kaine cast votes against Trump’s: •$1.5 trillion tax cut over 10 years, saying it would mainly benefits businesses and wealthy;. •Increased tariffs; •Tough stand on immigration; and •Efforts to end or dismantle Obamacare. Kaine’s response Ian Sams, communications director for Kaine’s campaign, says the presidential support rating presents an incomplete picture of Kaine’s accordance with Trump. He acknowledged in an email that Kaine ""objects to a lot"" of Trump’s initiatives, but added that the senator has been pleased by the president’s signature on a number of less-publicized bills and resolutions that help Virginia. They include: •Working towards a 355-ship Navy; •Federal recognition of Virginia’s native tribes; and •Several measures that improve veteran service and benefits. Our ruling Stewart says Kaine ""opposes everything President Trump does."" It’s a greatly hyped statement. Kaine doesn’t oppose every Trump action. When Trump has stated a position on legislation, records show Kaine has voted in support of him 34.2 percent of the time. Most of these votes have been on nominations. Not included in the calculation are a number of little-known bills and resolutions helping Virginia that Kaine backed and Trump quietly signed. But Stewart’s larger context - that Kaine fundamentally disagrees with Trump - is correct. Kaine has voted against confirming most of Trump’s major nominees, including Supreme Court Justice Gorsuch and 9 of the 15 people now in the president’s cabinet. Kaine has also voted against Trump’s defining initiatives on tax reform, immigration, health care and tariffs. He’s clearly opposed Trump most of the time on major issues. So we rate Stewart’s statement Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2018/sep/26/corey-stewart/stewart-close-describing-kaines-opposition-trump/

Mike DeWine misleads about Issue 1, the drug amendment in Ohio
","Republican Mike DeWine says Democrat Richard Cordray is soft on drug dealers in Ohio, a state hit hard by the opioid crisis. ""Cordray’s plan would allow drug dealers to remain on our streets,"" says DeWine’s TV ad. ""Even when they are caught with enough fentanyl to kill 10,000 people. The same drug that is killing Ohioans every day. Cordray’s plan would create a safe haven for drug dealers."" The ad refers to Corday’s support for Issue 1, a constitutional amendment that would reduce possession offenses to misdemeanors. DeWine, the attorney general, opposes the amendment. The question will appear on the November ballot when DeWine and Cordray face off for governor. We found that DeWine miscasts what the amendment would do and omits what Cordray has said about drug dealers. • This isn’t ""Cordray’s plan,"" although he supports the amendment. • Cordray has said drug dealers should serve long sentences. • The amendment reduces possession of drugs to a misdemeanor. • The amendment states that drug trafficking would remain a felony. If adopted, the amendment would reclassify drug possession -- including fentanyl -- as a misdemeanor and prohibit jail time until an individual's third offense within two years. Also, those already convicted of possession could ask a court to reduce their conviction to a misdemeanor. Felons, with some exceptions for certain offenses, could get a 25 percent reduction in prison time if they participate in rehabilitative, work or educational programs. Money that is saved from imprisonment would go toward rehabilitation and crime victim funds. But the amendment doesn’t let drug traffickers, a.k.a. dealers, off the hook. It states that the misdemeanor provisions ""do not apply to convictions for the sale, distribution, or trafficking of drugs"" or for convictions based on volume or weight that were classified as a first-, second-, or third-degree felony offense. That leaves fourth- and fifth-degree felony possessions to be reclassified misdemeanors, which the DeWine campaign says would include fentanyl, which is deadly in small amounts. DeWine’s campaign points to an op-ed against the amendment by Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court Maureen O’Connor who said an offender charged with possession of 19 grams of fentanyl would only receive a misdemeanor. Since the lethal dose of fentanyl is just 2 milligrams, 19 grams of fentanyl is enough to kill about 10,000 people, she wrote. But the key here is the word ""possession."" Defendants who deal drugs can still be charged with felony trafficking, said Ohio State University Law professor Doug Berman, executive director of the Drug Enforcement and Policy Center. ""This is not about giving drug dealers a break; this is about freeing up resources to provide treatment to reduce the demand for the drugs,"" Berman said. The amendment will make prosecutors jobs harder -- they will no longer be able to only charge defendants with possession and send them to prison. Instead, they will have to prove trafficking, which involves additional elements beyond just merely possession -- and would mean that prosecutors would be putting their undercover officers on the stand. Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association argues the amendment may prevent felony charges for traffickers ""who deliberately deal in small amounts so that they can assert simple possession as a defense."" Kenneth R. Bailey , president of the Ohio Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said someone caught with a small amount of fentanyl could be charged with misdemeanor possession. But DeWine still isn’t telling the full story. ""In practice, trafficking is an often used companion charge to possession,"" Bailey said. ""If Issue 1 passes, there is nothing that prevents a prosecutor from bringing the misdemeanor possession count with a companion felony trafficking (charge)."" Generally, trafficking is not defined by the amount of the drug, but the purpose for which the possessor is going to use the drug, he said. In one case, a defendant was charged with trafficking for 10 grams of heroin and aggravated trafficking for possessing a bag containing less than a gram of heroin and fentanyl. The defense lawyers association is supporting Issue 1 with reservations, including the form of its implementation as an amendment and the removal of judicial discretion. DeWine’s ad says it is ""Cordray’s plan"" to let the drug dealers go free. While Cordray has stated support for Issue 1, it isn’t his plan. Advocates collected signatures to place it on the ballot. Also, DeWine is ignoring that Cordray has distinguished between penalties he wants to see for users and drug dealers. Cordray has said, ""As governor, I will work with law enforcement to make sure drug dealers are convicted and serve long prison sentences, while people who need substance abuse treatment can get it in our communities."" At least 11 states as of January 2018 have lowered some drug possession crimes from a felony to a misdemeanor, said Alison Lawrence, who tracks drug laws for the National Conference of State Legislatures. DeWine’s ad says Cordray’s ""plan would allow drug dealers to remain on our streets."" Issue 1 would lower possession to a misdemeanor and prohibit jail time until an individual's third offense within two years. That could apply to someone in possession of fentanyl, which is deadly in small amounts. Cordray supports the amendment, but it's a far stretch to call it his plan. Most importantly, the amendment still leaves drug trafficking as a felony, and that includes trafficking of fentanyl. Nothing about the proprosal allows drug dealers to remain on the streets if prosecutors prove the charge in a court of law.  We rate this claim False.

Scott Walker's claim that Tony Evers said taxes should pay for abortions as they do tonsillectomies
","A telephone poll conducted for the re-election campaign of Republican Gov. Scott Walker tested lines of attack on state schools superintendent Tony Evers, Walker’s Democratic challenger in the Nov. 6, 2018 election. The person conducting the poll, which was revealed by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Sept. 17, 2018, would read a statement. Then she asked the person on the other end of the line if the statement would make her more likely, or less likely, to vote for Evers. One of the statements was: ""Tony Evers says that tax dollars should pay for the abortions just like they pay for tonsillectomies."" Evers didn’t say exactly that; but it’s close. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. To begin, let’s note that we will be talking about Medicaid. The state-federal insurance program provides coverage for some low-income people, families and children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with disabilities. On abortion, federal law prevents states from using federal Medicaid money to pay for an abortion unless the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or the abortion is necessary to save the life of the woman. States can use their own funds to cover other medically necessary abortions — usually defined by states as those to protect the physical or mental health of the woman  — for Medicaid beneficiaries. In Wisconsin, Medicaid can be used to pay for an abortion if continuing the pregnancy would ""cause grave and long-lasting damage to the physical health of the woman,"" according to the state Department of Health Services. Now to Evers’ comments.
  A couple of weeks before the poll, the conservative Weekly Standard published an article based on an interview it did with Evers. The article reported that Evers said tax dollars should be used to pay for abortions, just as they do for tonsillectomies. More specifically, this was the exchange: Weekly Standard reporter: One story I'm interested in is the role of pro-life Democrats: Do they have a place in the party? There've been fewer and fewer in Congress. What is your message to them? Do you want to see Medicaid funding of abortion generally? I know that's restricted in Wisconsin.

Evers: Yeah, we have a big tent here in Wisconsin. We have to, in order to win elections. And yes, pro-life Democrats are welcome in the party, and I respect their decisions on this issue. But we need to have the Medicaid money be available for all people and restricting it because of a certain procedure, whether it's a tonsillectomy or any other procedure, seems to me a foolhardy thing to do. So, yes, we have to respect people's pro-life beliefs, and certainly they're welcome in the Democratic Party. Absolutely. All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. Evers’ remarks drew criticism from conservative media, anti-abortion groups and the Rev. Franklin Graham, president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. Walker tweeted a link to the article. When we asked Evers’ campaign about his remarks, the campaign told us: ""Tony was talking about access to reproductive care. He believes the government shouldn’t be in the business of coming between patients and doctors and that everyone should have access to affordable reproductive health care."" So, when asked about Medicaid funding for abortion, Evers said the use of Medicaid, which is tax funded, should not be restricted by any procedure, which would include abortion. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Walker stated: ""Tony Evers says that tax dollars should pay for the abortions just like they pay for tonsillectomies."" Evers didn’t make that exact statement, but the statement is a reasonable way to describe what he said. A reporter had asked Evers: ""Do you want to see Medicaid funding of abortion generally?"" And Evers replied saying, ""we need to have the Medicaid money be available for all people, and restricting it because of a certain procedure, whether it's a tonsillectomy or any other procedure, seems to me a foolhardy thing to do."" So, Evers said the use of Medicaid, which is tax funded, should not be restricted by any procedure, which would include abortion.

Ted Cruz simplifies, saying Beto O'Rourke called police officers 'modern-day Jim Crow'
","U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the Republican seeking a second term against Democratic U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke, portrayed O'Rourke as wildly out of step with Texas in part, Cruz said, by standing against police officers who protect communities with their lives. Cruz offered as backup in the pair's Sept. 21, 2018, debate at Southern Methodist University a flawed charge that O’Rourke, who represents El Paso in the House, voted against body armor for sheriffs. That's False, we’ve ruled, in that there was no such vote. Cruz also said O'Rourke had said he’d be open to abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement. We've found that claim Mostly True though O’Rourke also has said he wouldn’t eliminate the agency without another department absorbing its duties. Cruz said next: ""And just this week, Congressman O’Rourke described law enforcement, described police officers, as modern-day Jim Crow."" Cruz called that descriptive--which refers to the post-Reconstruction practice of denying black Americans equal rights on all fronts--offensive. ""That is not Texas,"" Cruz said. O’Rourke replied in the debate: ""What Sen. Cruz said is simply untrue. I did not call police officers modern-day Jim Crow."" So, did he? By email, Catherine Frazier of Cruz’s campaign told us Cruz was referring to O’Rourke’s reply to a question during a Sept. 19, 2018, event at Prairie View A&M University as recapped by the conservative Daily Caller. Frazier also noted a press release critical of O’Rourke’s characterization issued by the Texas Municipal Police Association. Facebook Live video To see all that O'Rourke said, we turned to the O’Rourke campaign’s Facebook Live video of the Prairie View event. About 58 minutes in, O’Rourke was asked a question we had trouble making out about how he’d address the needs of former slaves. In reply, O’Rourke referred to the discovery this year of dozens of unmarked graves in Texas’s Fort Bend County indicating, he said, that well after the Civil War, law officers would arrest African American residents for idling and petty crimes to fill out work crews for contractors, a notorious convict-leasing system, according to a Houston Chronicle news story. O’Rourke said such individuals were ""people who became convicts solely by dint of the color of their skin,"" he said, under a system that was ""radically unjust."" O’Rourke went on: ""That injustice, to many more people here that I know firsthand, continues to persist today. That system of suspending somebody, solely based on the color of their skin; searching that person solely based on the color of their skin; stopping that person solely based on the color of their skin; shooting that person solely based on the color of their skin; throwing the book at that person and letting them rot behind bars solely based on the color of their skin, is why some have called this, I think it is an apt description, the new Jim Crow."" He said next: ""We have written people off and written people out of the economic life of this country, their ability to participate in the future of the United States of America. We have literally drawn people out of their state House, their congressional, their state Senate districts solely based on the color of their skin."" Some outside perspective: A 2010 book, ""The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Color Blindness,"" includes a chapter in which author Michelle Alexander, of late an oped columnist for the New York Times, says the imprisonment of 1 million black American men can greatly be attributed to how police and the criminal justice system handle the pursuit, detention and prosecution of black men, many times for drug crimes oft ignored when committed by white people. It adds up to discrimination that’s perfectly legal, Alexander writes, because it’s based on a person’s criminal record. ""In the system of mass incarceration,"" Alexander writes, ""a wide variety of laws, institutions, and practices--ranging from racial profiling to biased sentencing policies, political disenfranchisement, and legalized employment discrimination--trap African Americans in a virtual (and literal) cage."" O'Rourke camp disputes Cruz's claim Chris Evans of O’Rourke’s campaign answered our inquiry with an email disputing Cruz’s conclusion that O’Rourke called law enforcement or police officers the new Jim Crow. Evans stressed that O’Rourke was speaking, as he said, to the ""system."" Evans wrote: ""As Beto has done at many forums in the past, he outlined how institutionalized inequity -- in education, in economics, in health care, in the justice system, in housing, in transportation -- has been referred to as the New Jim Crow."" Evans also pointed us to an August 2018 O’Rourke commentary published in the Chronicle. In it, O’Rourke describes his tour of the Harris County Jail, which he calls ""part of the world’s largest prison population. One that is disproportionately comprised of people of color, though we know that people of all races use illegal drugs at roughly the same rate. Many have called this the New Jim Crow, and for good reason."" In the commentary, O’Rourke goes on to talk about the share of black children with a parent in the U.S. criminal justice system and he says that such results begin with a ""school-to-prison pipeline"" starting as early as kindergarten, where a black child is far more likely than a white child to be suspended or expelled, he says. Evans further emailed us web links to fact-checks by NBC and the Associated Press of Cruz’s debate statement, each one stating the senator oversimplified what O’Rourke had said at the university. Our ruling Cruz said O’Rourke described police as ""modern-day Jim Crow."" This claim has an element of truth in that O’Rourke’s embrace of the ""new Jim Crow"" description followed his excoriation of police stops, searches and shootings he attributed to the color of a person’s skin. But O’Rourke also said such actions rank among ways the country systematically discriminates against black residents--extending, he said, to sentencing, economic opportuniy and to how lawmakers carve districts.

Beto O'Rourke says he didn't try to leave DWI accident scene. Police cited witness saying otherwise.
","Nearly a month after a police report surfaced on his 1998 arrest for driving while intoxicated, Democratic U.S. Senate nominee Beto O’Rourke fielded a follow-up question during his Sept. 21, 2018 debate with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. Gromer Jeffers of the Dallas Morning News said to O’Rourke: ""You have addressed your 1998 DWI arrest numerous times during your public career. But not this question: As the Houston Chronicle pointed out recently, a witness said in that accident that you tried to leave the scene of the accident. Did you and should voters be concerned about this incident?"" O’Rourke replied at the Southern Methodist University debate: ""I did not try to leave the scene of the accident--though driving drunk, which I did, is a terrible mistake for which there is no excuse or justification or defense and I will not try to provide one. I can only tell you that I was able to have a second chance in my life."" O’Rourke went on to tick-tock his subsequent opening of a business with friends in his hometown of El Paso where, he said, he met his wife with whom he’s raising three children. Also, O’Rourke said, he won election to the El Paso City Council and, in 2012, to the U.S. House, which he’s leaving after this year. ""I made the most that I could with my second choice and my opportunity,"" O’Rourke said. Readers asked us if O’Rourke tried to leave the scene of his accident and arrest. Houston Chronicle news story cites police report The Chronicle, in an Aug. 30, 2018, news story, said a police report shows that the incident was a more serious threat to public safety than previously reported. The newspaper, citing the report, said that O’Rourke was driving drunk at what a witness called ""a high rate of speed"" in a 75 mph zone on Interstate 10 about a mile east of the New Mexico border. He lost control and hit a truck, sending his car careening across the center median. The story said that the witness, described as stopping at the scene, later told police that O’Rourke had tried to leave the scene. The report, the story says, refers to an unnamed ""motorist’s description of O’Rourke’s dark-colored Volvo passing him quickly about 3 a.m. on I-10."" The story says that O'Rourke reportedly struck a truck going in the same direction and crossed a grassy median into the opposite lanes. The story says that according to the police report, ""O’Rourke then attempted to leave the scene but was stopped by the same motorist he had just passed. The unidentified motorist ‘then turned on his overhead lights to warn oncoming traffic and to try to get the defendant (O’Rourke) to stop,’ the report says."" The story says that O'Rourke recorded a 0.136 and 0.134 on police breathalyzers, above a blood-alcohol level of 0.10, the state legal limit at the time. He was arrested at the scene, the story said, and charged with DWI, but completed a court-approved diversion program and had the charges dismissed, post-arrest developments we confirmed for a previous fact-check confirming the September 1998 arrest and a previous one, when O’Rourke was a college student, for getting past a fence to enter the University of Texas at El Paso campus in the wee hours. Police agency confirms report's authenticity By email, we asked the Anthony Police Department to review the 12-page partially-redacted police report posted next to the Chronicle story. In response, a department officer, Linda Hartt-Goggin, said the posted report ""appears to be a true redacted copy of the original report."" Hartt-Goggin said by phone she couldn’t find the department’s report on the accident itself. She speculated that it was lost when a room was flooded. According to APD Investigator Richard Carrera’s report, filed three days after the accident, O’Rourke said after his 3 a.m. arrest that he’d been driving to Los Alamos in New Mexico. The officer’s report says that he met at the scene with a witness--called the ""reporter"" in Carrera’s report--and his partner, the driver of ""the American Medical ambulance."" By phone, Hartt-Goggin told us the ambulance company serves private clients out of Las Cruces, NM. Our attempts to reach a Las Cruces official with American Medical Response, a Colorado-based company, didn’t draw an immediate response. Carrera’s report says the witness said that he initially saw a green Volvo pass his vehicle at a high rate of speed westbound on I-10. ""The vehicle then lost control moments later and struck a truck traveling the same direction,"" the report says. ""After the driver/defendant struck the truck, it sent the defendant’s vehicle across the center median and to a complete stop facing east bound,"" the report says. ""The defendant/driver then attempted to leave the scene,"" the report says. But the witness ""turned on his overhead lights to warn oncoming traffic and to get the defendant to stop."" The report says that when the officer engaged O’Rourke in conversation, he wasn’t understandable due to slurred speech. The report says the officer asked O’Rourke to step out of the vehicle and ""upon doing so the defendant almost fell to the floor,"" the report says. Separately, the Austin American-Statesman asked the Texas Department of Public Safety for agency reports on file about the incident. M.L. Calcote said in a September 2018 letter sent by email that the agency didn’t have responsive records. O'Rourke stands by debate statement We asked O’Rourke’s campaign about the witness telling Carrera that O’Rourke tried to leave the accident scene. By email, Chris Evans said O’Rourke stands by what he said at the debate about not trying to leave. Evans noted that the ""police report shows he was arrested for a DWI, not for leaving or attempting to leave the scene."" Our ruling O’Rourke said he didn’t try to leave the scene of his 1998 DWI accident and arrest. Records indicate O’Rourke was arrested at the scene and wasn’t charged with trying to flee. But the September 1998 Anthony Police Department report on the incident says a witness said O’Rourke tried to leave the scene before police arrived and the witness kept him from doing so.

No, Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford isn't linked to abortion pill
","Several headlines on the internet claim Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, had an ulterior motive. ""Kavanaugh accuser worked for pharma company that sold ‘abortion pill’ for alternative uses,"" a Sept. 21 headline on Patriot News Alerts read. (Kavanaugh has denied the accusation.) Others took it further. ""Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey exposed for ties to Big Pharma abortion pill maker… effort to derail Kavanaugh is plot to protect abortion industry profits,"" a Sept. 20 headline on Natural News read. Abortion rights advocates worry that Kavanaugh would reverse Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court case that legalized abortion. These stories suggest that Ford went after Kavanaugh because of a special interest in protecting abortion-inducing drugs. That’s a big stretch. Ford worked as director of biostatistics for Corcept Therapeutics, a California pharmaceutical start-up, from 2006 to 2012, according to an archive of her since-deleted LinkedIn page. Corcept published six papers under her name. But claiming that Corcept sells an abortion pill is like saying a road salt company sells food seasoning. The company sells Korlym to treat Cushing's syndrome, a rare, deadly condition characterized by high cortisol levels. Korlym’s main ingredient, mifepristone, blocks the effect of cortisol. That ingredient has another use. Just like it blocks cortisol, mifepristone blocks progesterone, which is crucial to the development of a pregnancy. In a medication-induced abortion, mifepristone is administered first and another drug, misoprostol, follows. That empties the uterus by causing cramping and bleeding. The latter drug, misoprostol, can and is used alone for abortions. However, the combination of both drugs is typically used for greater effectiveness and fewer side effects. Mifepristone, on the other hand, is not administered alone to induce abortions. In some other countries, it is used alone as emergency contraception, according to Clare Flannery, a professor of endocrinology and reproductive sciences at Yale University. That’s not an abortifacient, according to Flannery, because it plays a role before the sperm and egg implant in the uterus. (Pregnancy occurs after implantation.) In order to induce an abortion in the United States, a low dose of mifepristone is used only once in combination with misoprostol. Korlym patients take up to four times that dose of mifepristone daily for months or even years. Korlym was the first drug the Food and Drug Administration approved for Cushing’s syndrome. ""Mifepristone was developed in 1980, but there was so much political concern for its use in aiding abortions, that its other therapeutic potentials were overlooked and companies were nervous to pursue it for other conditions,"" Flannery said. The company explicitly warns about the drug’s potential to terminate a pregnancy. ""Korlym should never be taken by women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant,"" a banner on the website reads. ""Taking Korlym during pregnancy will result in the loss of a pregnancy. A pregnancy test is required before starting Korlym or if treatment is interrupted for more than 14 days."" A headline said, ""Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey exposed for ties to Big Pharma abortion pill maker… effort to derail Kavanaugh is plot to protect abortion industry profits."" Ford worked for a pharmaceutical company that sells Korlym, a drug that treats Cushing’s syndrome. The main ingredient in that drug is used in combination with another drug to induce abortions, but the doses differ. The company does not promote the drug for abortions; in fact, it requires that doctors rule out pregnancy in order to administer the drug.

Does Danny O'Connor get 90 percent of his campaign funds from out of staters?
","The Republican incumbent in Ohio’s 12th Congressional District is being outraised by his Democratic opponent by nearly $4 million. But Republican Troy Balderson says that’s because Democrat Danny O’Connor has received most of his campaign funds from out-of-state contributors. A Sept. 8, 2018, Cleveland Plain Dealer story points out that Balderson, of Zanesville, is badly losing the fundraising battle in his November rematch with O’Connor, a Franklin County recorder. The two faced off in an Aug. 7 special election that ended in Balderson narrowly beating O’Connor to hold the seat for the next two months. ""Liberal, out-of-state special-interest groups are continuing to prop up Danny O’Connor’s campaign in their efforts to retake the House and put Nancy Pelosi in the Speaker’s chair,"" the Balderson campaign said in a statement published in newspapers in Cleveland and Columbus. ""While O'Connor's campaign has raised 90 percent of his campaign funds from liberal out of staters, our campaign is funded by hard-working Ohioans who want someone who will fight for them and their middle class values."" We wondered, do 90 percent of O’Connor’s campaign contributions come from outside of Ohio? No, but O’Connor is raising significant support from out-of-state donors. Trying to measure where a candidate’s campaign funds come from can be tricky for a couple of reasons. First, donations under $200 aren’t itemized, so campaigns aren’t required to provide the addresses of those low-dollar donors. Second, Democrats running for Congress have been using ActBlue PAC, which is based in Somerville, Mass., to manage online candidate contributions. We went to the Center for Responsive Politics, an authoritative database of campaign finance data, to examine O’Connor’s numbers, as well as the Federal Election Commission. Both databases show that, as of late August, O’Connor has raised around $5.5 million with a little over $1 million in cash on hand. (Balderson has raised almost $1.8 million with just under $93,000 in cash on hand.) O’Connor has received $405,528 in individual contributions from more than 2,000 Ohio donors, according to FEC filings. This compares to roughly $1,356,583 raised by the campaign from all other states combined. That adds up to $1.76 million in donations, just about a third of everything O’Connor has raised. Where is the rest of the money? More than $3.5 million of O’Connor’s donations are unitemized. FEC press officer Judith Ingram told us that donations under $200 do not require the identifying information needed to know where each geographically comes from. Brendan Quinn, outreach manager at the Center for Responsive Politics, said the same. ""Campaigns are only required to itemize contributions of $200 or more, and that includes multiple donations that add up to that amount,"" Quinn explained. ""And according to our data, over 60 percent (64.87) of O’Connor’s contributions are those small individual contributions under $200."" But of O’Connor’s itemized donations, 23 percent of the money received comes from Ohio and 77 percent comes from out of state. So why did Balderson claim 90 percent of O’Connor’s funds came from ""liberal out of staters""? Balderson campaign manager Jenna Knepper said the campaign zeroed in on the period between July 19 and Aug. 2, the closing weeks of the special election. It counted the number of people who contributed from Ohio versus other states during that time period. FEC filings for that report show that O’Connor received a total of 12,580 contributions. Of those, 1,368 came from Ohio, and the other 11,212 came from other states. By those figures, 10.9 percent of the contributions originated from Ohio and the other 89.1 came from outside of the state. The O’Connor campaign says he has raised more money from Ohioans than the FEC data show. They backed that up with figures from their records from Jan. 1, 2018, to Aug. 27, 2018, which they reported to the NGP, a privately owned voter database and web hosting service provider used by the  Democratic Party. These incorporate the contributions not included in national databases because of the lower donation amounts. The numbers show that O’Connor has raised around $866,233 in Ohio with an average donation of $37.54 — more than double what the FEC data show. Balderson said O’Connor has raised ""90 percent of his campaign funds from liberal out of staters."" In the most recent fundraising report, almost 90 percent of O’Connor’s campaign contributions came from donors outside of Ohio. That’s donors, not money. But when it comes to O’Connors overall itemized donations thus far in the race, the situation isn’t as stark. Combined, 23 percent stemmed from in-state contributions, and 77 percent came from all other states combined. The percentages do not include contributions under $200, because the FEC doesn’t require certain information such as donors’ addresses. Balderson’s statement is inflated and incomplete. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2018/sep/25/troy-balderson/does-danny-oconnor-get-90-percent-his-campaign-fun/

Kaine is right: Record jobs growth streak precedes Trump
","U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine had an old prediction tossed back at him during a debate this summer. It was thrown by moderator Judy Woodruff, the anchor and managing editor of PBS NewsHour. She reminded Kaine that in 2016, when he was the Democratic nominee for vice president, he said the election of then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ""would be a disaster for the economy."" Woodruff asked Kaine to square that with the strong economic results during the first 18 months of the Trump administration: about 3 million new jobs, the unemployment rate dipping below 4 percent, and ""soaring"" corporate profits. Kaine replied, ""The national economy was strong, in its longest expansion in private sector jobs, before President Trump came into office."" We fact-checked Kaine’s claim that Trump, when he became president on Jan. 20, 2017, inherited the nation’s longest expansion of private jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps monthly records on private sector employment back to 1939. They show that the U.S. experienced 82 months straight months of private sector job growth before Trump became president - from March 2010 through December 2016, when Barack Obama was in the White House. That easily qualifies for the longest streak during the eight decades the BLS had been keeping the statistics prior to Trump’s presidency. The streak is still alive under Trump and - through August 2018, the latest statistics are available - is up to 112 months. The second longest streak was 64 months. It ran from May 1995 through October 2000, when Bill Clinton was president. The longest continuous drop in private employment lasted 22 months - from January 2008 through October 2009 during the Great Recession. That was during the last year of George W. Bush’s administration and the first year of Obama’s. Presidents from both political parties traditionally have been quick to claim the credit for good economies and fast to dodge the blame when times turn bad. Economists have repeatedly told us it’s mostly a political dance; that the policies of presidents and  governors don’t drive economic ups and downs. Our ruling Kaine said, ""The national economy was strong in its largest expansion of private sector jobs before President Trump came into office."" Data shows he’s right.

Quote from Dianne Feinstein about veterans and guns is fabricated
","A quote allegedly from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., saying veterans are mentally ill and shouldn't own firearms is fabricated.

Source: Facebook This image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here's how the hoax was born. At a March 7, 2013, Senate hearing to reinstate a ban on certain types of assault weapons, Texas Sen. John Cornyn offered an amendment to exempt former military personnel from the law. Cornyn said that veterans should be allowed to own assault weapons as they are most highly-trained and qualified individuals. He also explained that disarming these people prevents veterans of a way to protect their families and communities. He said, ""Members and veterans of the Armed Forces are the most highly-trained and qualified individuals to own these weapons for self-defense purposes. We should think long and hard before disarming these heroes, preventing them from protecting their families and communities."" Feinstein oppposed the amendment. Part of her rationale was that some veterans could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. ""If I understand this, this (amendment) adds an exemption of retired military. As I understand our bill, no issue has arose (sic) in this regard during the 10 years the expired ban was in effect and what we did in the other bill was exempt possession by the United States or a department or agency of the United States. So that included active military. The problem with expanding this is that, you know, with the advent of PTSD, which I think is a new phenomenon as a product of the Iraq War, it’s not clear how the seller or transferrer of a firearm covered by this bill would verify that an individual was a member, or a veteran, and that there was no impairment of that individual with respect to having a weapon like this. So, you know, I would be happy to sit down with you again and see if we could work something out but I think we have to — if you’re going to do this, find a way that veterans who are incapacitated for one reason or another mentally don’t have access to this kind of weapon."" (See the discussion via C-Span starting from 1:30:00.)

Donald Trump has a point that NAFTA shuttered thousands of plants
","How has the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, affected the number of manufacturing plants in the United States since its enactment in 1994? It’s been a big negative, President Donald Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity during an interview in Las Vegas. Trump, who has negotiated with both Canada and Mexico to replace the current agreement, told Hannity, ""NAFTA was a disaster. We lost thousands of plants. We lost millions of jobs. NAFTA was a disaster."" We take up Trump’s statement about job losses in a separate fact-check. Here, we’ll look at the question of plants that have been lost post-NAFTA. The United States saw a loss of more than 80,000 manufacturing establishments from 1994 through 2014. Data from a Census Bureau series, Business Dynamics Statistics, tallied 357,330 manufacturing establishments in 1994 and 274,756 in 2014, the last year for which data is available.   Granted, it’s unlikely that every shuttered manufacturing plant owes its closure to NAFTA. Among other things, advancements in technology have revolutionized manufacturing in recent years. But even if a small fraction of the closures stem at least in part from NAFTA, then Trump’s use of  ""thousands"" is valid. Trump said that since NAFTA, ""we lost thousands of plants."" That's actually an understatement. The United States lost 80,000 plants since then. Not all can be blamed on NAFTA, but even if only a fraction of them can be, Trump has a point.

Donald Trump says NAFTA killed millions of jobs. That's not proven
","In an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity in Las Vegas, President Donald Trump went back to a favorite rhetorical target: the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. Trump talked about trade negotiations with Mexico and how he believes he can create a new deal that is fair for both countries. ""NAFTA was a disaster. We lost thousands of plants,"" Trump said. ""We lost millions of jobs. NAFTA was a disaster."" On several occasions, we’ve looked at the tricky question of how to tally the employment impacts of the trade deal between the United States, Canada and Mexico enacted in 1994. In this case, Trump exaggerates the highest available estimate of lost jobs as a result of the deal. Estimates of jobs lost from NAFTA ranges widely, but we have not seen any estimate as high as ""millions."" The biggest number comes from a report by the liberal Economic Policy Institute, which receives support from labor unions. A 2014 report from the group found that from 1993 to 2013, ""the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico and Canada increased from $17 (billion) to $177.2 billion, displacing 851,700 U.S. jobs. All of the net jobs displaced were due to growing trade deficits with Mexico."" But this isn’t the only estimate that’s been offered. And as you’ll see, the numbers vary widely. Business groups argue that trade deals actually boost employment, pointing to a 2010 report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The chamber found that the 14 trade deals in place in 2008 supported 5.4 million jobs, with the lion’s share of those jobs stemming from NAFTA. Assessments not aligned with either business or labor have generally suggested that the trade deal had a modest overall impact on jobs, though with certain industries — such as cars and electronics — suffering more than others. NAFTA ""had particularly heavy, negative impacts on employment in the auto and parts industries, and a few others, such as electric appliances,"" said Robert Scott, who authored the EPI report. He added that the upper Midwest suffered disproportionately, though some of the production was moved to non-union locations in the South. The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan policy arm of Congress, concluded that ""the net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest."" A similar review published by the international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reached the same conclusion. It’s also worth noting that assigning blame for job losses is not always clear. The U.S-China Business Council and the Financial Times have argued that the loss in manufacturing jobs were not due to trade with China so much as gains in technology and productivity, as well as the result of a more sophisticated economy. And during the last year of his presidency, Bill Clinton signed legislation granting China permanent normal trade relations. From 2000 on, this had an enormous impact on trade between the two nations — and it overlaps with about half the period when analysts have tried to gauge the effect of NAFTA. This complicates any analysis of NAFTA’s specific impact. For all its faults, Scott said, NAFTA’s impact pales compared to the job losses from expanded trade with China. The Economic Policy Institute has estimated that the United States has lost 3.2 million jobs between 2001 and 2013 to trade with China, so it’s possible that Trump was conflating NAFTA and trade with China. ""Trump’s intense focus on renegotiating NAFTA, and his claim that under NAFTA ‘millions of jobs were lost,’ is not only wrong, but a vast overstatement, and a misleading misstatement of the principal sources of our trade problems,"" Scott said. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Trump said that under the North American Free Trade Agreement, ""we lost millions of jobs."" We did not find any study that estimates that NAFTA alone cost ""millions"" of jobs. The largest estimate is about 800,000, and other studies show smaller negative, and sometimes positive, impacts.

Texas's Fletcher tries to hit Culberson on Obamacare
","Affordable health care is a salient issue in the 2018 congressional elections, and an ad from a Houston Democrat has a familiar ring. Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, hoping to unseat Republican U.S. Rep. John Culberson in Texas’s 7th Congressional District, says her opponent ""is taking a wrecking ball"" to a system that needs improvement, not demolition. It’s an ad with a particular appeal to older voters, because Fletcher says in it that ""Culberson voted to let insurance companies charge people 50 and over five times more than younger people."" Maybe you’ve heard similar claims before. Democrats across the country are using them against their Republican opponents, and PolitiFact has checked out many of them. But we went a little local on this one. Let’s dig in. Fletcher and other Democrats are basing this claim on provisions in the American Health Care Act, passed by the House of Representatives along party lines on May 4, 2017. The bill was rejected in the Senate. The legislation was important for several reasons, but chiefly because it would have changed — and not simply repealed, as earlier bills had attempted — the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, also known as Obamacare. The new bill would have allowed insurers to charge certain customers over age 50 -- those buying policies in individual and small-group markets -- up to five times as much as they charge their youngest customers. Age has always factored into the price of insurance for the simple reason that older people tend to use more health care services. But the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, limited the age-to-premium ratio: The oldest insurance buyers in the individual and small group markets could be charged no more than three times the premiums as the youngest buyers. Say that premiums for a 20-year-old were $100 a month. A 60-year-old could be charged no more than $300 a month for the same policy under the ACA. Prior to Obamacare, ""premiums for older adults were typically four or five times the premiums charged to younger adults,"" the Kaiser Family Foundation said in a March 2017 report. So the Republican House bill would have lifted the age-permitted ratios closer to where they were before the Affordable Care Act. There were ifs, ands and buts concerning this proposed change. But before we get to them, let’s look at how the age change might have played out if the House bill had become law. We are able to do this because the Kaiser Family Foundation developed a data and mapping tool that allowed for illustrative comparisons of insurance policy costs under the existing and the proposed new laws. This was strictly for people buying policies on the individual market, not for employer-sponsored insurance. We ran scenarios comparing premiums for a silver-tier, or average plan, covering a 27-year-old and a 60-year-old living in Harris County, Texas — the Houston area. As commercials say, actual results might vary, and it’s worth noting that just because the law allows something, it doesn’t mean every situation will match it. In the Kaiser model, premiums for the 27-year-old were $3,340 a year on the individual market under the ACA. Premiums for a 60-year-old were $8,660. That means the 60-year-old’s premiums were about 2.6 times higher than the 27-year-old’s. Under the House bill that Culberson supported, the 60-year-old’s premiums would have jumped to $11,630, while the 27-year-olds would have shrunk to $3,080. That means that in this example, the 60-year-old’s premiums would have been nearly 3.8 times as high as the 27-year-old’s. This illustration shows premiums before accounting for taxpayer subsidies, or ""premium tax credits,"" that many buyers use to offset their costs. The ACA subsidies are based on overall income, but they also take into account federal guidelines for the maximum share of income someone should have to pay for health insurance and the cost of a benchmark plan in his or her area. The House bill that Culberson supported would have changed the subsidy system, basing it solely on age, although subsidies regardless of age would phase out when incomes exceeded $75,000. A number of analyses, including one from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said such a change would generally benefit younger buyers and force older buyers to pay more out of pocket for their premiums. Using the Kaiser Family Foundation data tool, we looked again at Houston scenarios for a 27-year-old and a 60-year-old each earning $40,000 a year. The 27-year-old currently doesn't qualify for a subsidy because his income is too high -- relative to the cost of his health coverage -- under the ACA. But under the 2017 House bill, he would have qualified for a $2,000 age-based subsidy. That would have reduced his out-of-pocket costs for premiums to $1,080. A 60-year-old with that same income now qualifies for a $4,580 subsidy. Under the bill Culberson supported, the age-based subsidy would be $4,000. That would put the 60-year-old’s net premiums, after subsidies, at $7,630, seven times more than the 27-year-old’s. Remember, the new law would limit the difference in base premiums, not the amounts due after accounting for subsidies. Would things have played out like this for sure? It depends on the moving parts. This example showed a narrower difference than five-to-one before subsidies, but actual differences change not only by region of the country but sometimes also by county. Nationally, AARP said on the day of the House vote that under the bill, unsubsidized premiums for 60- to 64-year-olds would average almost $18,000 per year, while 20- to 29-year-olds were expected to see average unsubsidized premiums of $4,010 per year. That would make the older group’s premiums 4.5 percent higher than the younger group’s. Fletcher was accurate in saying that Culberson voted to ""let insurance companies charge people 50 and over five times more than younger people."" But she did not mention that the ACA already lets them charge three times more. Her ad also could give the impression that this would have applied to everyone over 50, whereas it only would have affected the individual and small-group markets. It would not have affected large employer plans. And the Republican bill would not have affected people 65 and older because they are covered under Medicare, the national program for seniors. We rate Fletcher’s claim Half True. ",/factchecks/2018/sep/24/lizzie-pannill-fletcher/texass-fletcher-tries-hit-culberson-obamacare/

Cuccinelli U-turns on restoring voting rights to non-violent felons
","
For years, Virginia Democrats have been trying to make it easier for non-violent felons to regain their civil rights after they’ve paid their debts to society. But Democrats cried foul last week when Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, the Republican nominee for governor, endorsed the cause. 
""Like many other legislators, I fought...for years on automatic restoration of rights legislation while Ken Cuccinelli and his extreme allies opposed us,"" said state Sen. Donald McEachin, D-Henrico. ""Now it has become convenient for him to suddenly do an about face on this issue."" 
Charniele Herring, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said Cuccinelli, as a state senator last decade, consistently opposed legislation that would have allowed the automatic restoration of voting rights for non-violent felons who completed their sentences. ""If Ken Cuccinelli really believed in automatic restoration of rights for people who pay their debt to society, he had every opportunity to prove it with his vote,"" Herring said. 
Cuccinelli, during a May 28 news conference, acknowledged his position has evolved. We pulled out our Flip-O-Meter to gauge the scope of his change. 
Virginia felons face one of the toughest laws for restoring civil rights in the nation. Under the state constitution, the only way for them to regain voting rights is to get permission from the governor. 
As a senator, Cuccinelli opposed four resolutions and one bill that would have allowed Virginians to vote on a constitutional amendment that would have empowered the General Assembly to automatically restore voting rights to non-violent felons. Cuccinelli voted ""no"" in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2009. 
Now, let’s return to this year. On Jan. 14, the attorney general testified in favor of a constitutional amendment  for automatic voting restoration that was subsequently killed by a House subcommittee. 
On May 28, Cuccinelli called on Virginia to make it easier for non-violent felons to regain voting rights and released a report, put together by an advisory group he appointed, on ways to do that. 
""Many people in our communities have committed certain lower level, non-violent offenses in the past that are felonies; they completed their sentences; paid their fines, their court costs, their restitution, served their time and gone on to live law-abiding lives,"" Cuccinelli said during a news conference.  ""I believe we need a simpler way for those individuals who want to return to their place in our society to be given a second chance and regain their civil rights that were lost through a felony conviction."" 
Cuccinelli acknowledged, ""When I was in the Senate, I wasn’t very supportive of the restoration of rights. I thought of it as a part of the punishment for being a felon."" 
But the attorney general said he has grown increasingly concerned about what he called ""felony creep"" -- the trend of state politicians passing laws that elevate to felonies non-violent crimes that should remain as misdemeanors. 
He questioned, for example, whether someone stealing $200 should be charged with a felony as mandated in Virginia. Brian Gottstein,  spokesman for the attorney general, said while in the Senate, Cuccinelli voted for two unsuccessful bills that would have raised the dollar amount at which a theft becomes a felony. 
Cuccinelli also gave another reason for his change. ""...I felt rights restoration was good for society overall, because it could potentially reduce recidivism and because I’m looking for ways to make re-entry work."" 
So the record shows Cuccinelli changed his position on voting rights restoration and the attorney general acknowledges it. We rate it a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2013/jun/03/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-u-turns-restoring-voting-rights-non-vio/

Advanced by FitzGeraldin November and approved by the County Council in April, the program will establish a $100 college-savings account for every new kindergarten student who lives in Cuyahoga County. 
We knew the program was similarto San Francisco's Kindergarten to College initiative -- and previous coverage indicated FitzGerald knew it. San Francisco's effort was developed with the Corporation for Enterprise Development, which said about a dozen other communities nationwide have set up savings account programs for children. 
We asked FitzGerald's campaign how he backed up the statement that Cuyahoga was ""the first county in the United States to do so."" 
They cited one of the Truth-O-Meter's guiding principles, that words matter. 
FitzGerald specifically said Cuyahoga County's program guarantees a college savings account ""for every single child who enters kindergarten in this county."" 
By ""every single child,"" he meant that the program covers children entering kindergarten in public, private and parochial schools -- about 15,000 pupils a year. 
San Francisco's program, created in 2010, is similar but more restricted. It does not cover every child. The consolidated city-county program establishes a $50 savings account only for children entering kindergarten in public schools -- about 4,500 pupils a year. 
The Corporation for Enterprise Development, the Washington nonprofit that promotes saving and protecting assets and led the development of child savings programs, said no other program nationwide is on the scale established in Cuyahoga County. The county program is the nation's largest. 
FitzGerald said that the Cuyahoga County College Savings Account Program is the first county program in the nation ""to guarantee a college savings account for every single child who enters kindergarten."" 
The statement is accurate. Though additional information gives a fuller picture, it is not needed for accuracy, even in the context of a political speech. The statement was not misleading.

McAuliffe flip-flops on offshore oil drilling
","
Republicans, who have long called for oil drilling off Virginia’s coast, were not thrilled late last month when Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe joined their cause. 
""Terry McAuliffe, once again, stuck his finger in the wind to be sure he says whatever voters want to hear,"" said Anna Nix, a spokeswoman for Republican gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli. ""In 2009, when he was running in a liberal Democratic primary, he was absolutely against offshore drilling. Now, in 2013, McAuliffe realized that even Democrats are for offshore drilling and he can’t wait to jump on the bandwagon."" 
The Republican Party of Virginia issued a news release accusing McAuliffe of doing ""an about face."" 
So we rolled out the Flip-O-Meter to see if McAuliffe’s position on offshore oil drilling has changed. 
The issue has become a perennial debate in Virginia. Supporters say drilling would enhance the state economy and help the U.S. become energy independent; opponents say it poses environmental risk and that credible information about the offshore supply of oil does not exist. 
At the start of the decade, Virginia was part of an Interior Department lease plan for offshore oil and gas development, but the leases were deferred until after 2017 in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. 
In 2009, prior to the spill, McAuliffe made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. During a debate that May, he said offshore drilling should be done only for natural gas, not for crude oil. He said his position was identical to two other Democrats: then-Gov. Tim Kaine and Brian Moran, one of his opponents in the primary. 
""I've been consistent from the start of this campaign,"" McAuliffe said. ""There was bipartisan legislation passed, signed by Governor Kaine, promoted by Governor Kaine, that says no oil drilling, no oil drilling and limited exploration for oil and natural gas off the state’s coast."" 
The next day, McAuliffe stated in an online interview with The Washington Post, ""I do not support drilling for oil off our coast."" 
Now, let’s move forward. Kaine, during a successful 2012 bid for the U.S. Senate, changed his position on offshore drilling. In May 2013, he joined U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., in introducing a bill that would allow oil and gas exploration off the state’s coast. 
McAuliffe said through a spokesman that he supported the legislation. 
""Terry has learned more about offshore drilling from experts in Virginia,"" spokesman Josh Schwerin told The Washington Post. ""He thinks that because of technological progress we can now do it in a responsible fashion."" 
We asked Schwerin three times to expound on his comment, but did not get a response. 
McAuliffe has clearly shifted on offshore oil drilling. We rate it a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2013/jun/03/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffre-flip-flops-offshore-oil-drilling/

On a recent radio talk show, Wisconsin Democratic Party chairman Mike Tate gently criticized a widely discussed Republican bill mandating that food stamp recipients buy mostly healthy foods from a state-approved list. 
In doing so, Tate framed the debate around a certain orange-colored, cheese-flavored snack and a fruit grown in every state in the continental U.S. 
Tate spoke after one-third of Democrats in the state Assembly joined Republicans in approving the bill, which aims to cut down on junk food purchases seen as contributing to poor health in low-income families participating in the state’s FoodShare program. 
""I’ll be honest with you, I think that having nutritional standards is an important thing,"" Tate told liberal radio talker John ""Sly"" Sylvester of Monroe’s WEKZ-FM on May 14, 2013. ""I think there is a need for government to play a role in the marketplace and having healthy, nutritious food be available for people on FoodShare that can’t have access to it. "" 
Tate defended those who voted for the bill as well-intentioned in trying to ease an obesity problem that is worse in Milwaukee and other urban areas, but said the legislation may not have been the best mechanism to do it. Tate also unpacked some specific claims about urban areas, specifically Milwaukee. 
""You know, I think that it’s a problem that a bag of Cheetos costs less to buy than an apple,"" he said. ""You go around some neighborhoods in Milwaukee and, good luck trying to find an apple or a banana or some sort of healthy option."" 
Milwaukee Common Council President Willie Hines Jr. made a similar statement in a recent opinion piece in the Journal Sentinel, saying that ""it’s generally a lot easier to reach for the less expensive Cheetos, doughnuts and Suzy Q’s than the more pricey veggie chips, granola bars and almonds."" 
Is Tate right? 
To check out the two parts of Tate’s claim, we reached out to local food experts, but also fueled up a car to test the food market in some of Milwaukee’s poorest north-side neighborhoods. 
In all we made purchases at 11 stores, ranging from full-line groceries to corner convenience stores and gas-station marts, mostly in Milwaukee but a few in neighboring suburban communities. 
The first thing that jumped out at us: At 2-for-$1, a single serving bag of Cheetos Crunchy (170 calories, 18 percent of recommended daily fat allowance) is hard to beat on price for a snack. In fact, many stores offer a whole range of chips at 50 cents a bag. 
By comparison, when we sought out single apples at the lowest per-pound or individual price available, we paid less than half a buck only once. 
At the top end, we paid $1.21 and $1.20 for an apple at two full-size markets and 65 cents and 99 cents at two convenience stores. Still, we were able to beat or match the Cheetos price, finding apples for 37 cents at a major Milwaukee supermarket, and for 50 cents at two city convenience stores as well as a supermarket in bordering Wauwatosa. Not every store had apples and not every store had single apples. 
That was just for snack-sized purchases. Bulk packaging, of course, drops the cost. 
We found 5-packs of gala apples (estimated 79 calories each, 0 from fat) at a small grocery in Milwaukee for the equivalent of 40 cents a piece, give or take a penny. And a chain supermarket near the edge of the city, in Shorewood, had bags of apples that averaged about 45 cents a piece. A chain store had them for 38 cents apiece in bulk. 
But Cheetos can drop even lower, to as little as 24 cents cents a bag, in 50-bag packs in combination with other snack chips, we found at one supermarket in Milwaukee. 
It was clear from our limited check that Cheetos are often cheaper than apples -- though not always. 
Prices, of course, can vary widely depending on quantity, timing, sales and other factors. 
And individual appetites can skew comparisons -- a 3.75-ounce bag of Cheetos Crunchy Flamin’ Hot is advertised as four servings but we’re guessing it doesn’t always go down that way. That bag will set you back $1.49 -- or about 37 cents a serving if you can stop  after 21 pieces. 
Seeking fruit 
We sought out expert opinion on the larger issue Tate raised -- on the availability of healthy food options. 
Sherrie Tussler, executive director of the Hunger Task Force in Milwaukee, told us that many FoodShare recipients rely at least in part on convenience stores because they lack transportation to reach supermarkets that can offer fresher and sometimes less expensive products. 
Hunger Task Force, which opposes the state legislation as too expensive and complicated, closely tracks food availability in the city and plans to create a corner market emphasizing healthy foods. 
Residents in Milwaukee’s lowest socioeconomic-status group have more than twice the saturation of small food outlets as in higher-status neighborhoods, the Milwaukee Health Report 2012 study found. The annual report, by the Center for Urban Population Health, examines health disparities by socioeconomic status. 
""There is strong evidence that access to supermarkets rather than smaller grocery/convenience stores correlates with lower prevalence of overweight, obesity, and hypertension,"" the study said. 
The report said obesity rates in Milwaukee -- which easily top the Wisconsin average -- are highest in lower-economic status populations. The Health Report study found that inadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables is prevalent across all economic groups, but somewhat better at higher levels. 
""A lot of it is because you can afford it and you can find it,"" said Geoffrey Swain, medical director for the Milwaukee Health Department and a co-author of the Health Report study. 
A close observer of convenience stores in town commented recently that corner convenience stores are the main food source for Milwaukee’s poor. 
""Some stores do have fruits and vegetables, but are likely to be more expensive and of poorer quality, mainly because our nation’s produce distribution system is not geared to service the small mom-and-pop corner stores,"" Young Kim, executive director of the organization behind the north-side’s Fondy Farmers Market, wrote in May 14 column for Urban Milwaukee. Tate points to Kim’s piece as part of his argument on the difficulty in getting access to fresh fruit. 
Kim told us that fruit ""just isn’t nearly as readily available"" as some of the snack foods. ""Cheetos and a lot of those snack foods get delivered"" to small stores, in contrast to fruit, which small-store owners have to buy from larger stores and then mark up, he noted. Kim opposes the state legislation for singling out low-income people. 
In our spot check at five small stores, we, too, found that you can get some limited amounts of fruit at some corner stores -- as well as, of course, a full selection at the few larger food markets on Milwaukee’s north side. 
And we found that fruit quality was very mixed at the small stores, ranging from excellent to very poor. 
We learned that programs run by the Fondy Food Center and the Walnut Way Conservation Corp., among others, are working to try to put more fresh goods into local stores and educate people on healthy choices. 
The city of Milwaukee Health Department, through grant funding from the Healthier Wisconsin Partnership Program of the Medical College of Wisconsin, has provided funds for produce coolers in several convenience stores in the Lindsay Heights neighborhood on Milwaukee’s north side. At one store, Eagle Foods at N. 14th and W. Centers streets, we found fruit in a large and prominent display near a cooler stocked with take-out servings of cut fruit and vegetables, as well as mangoes and tomatoes. 
At the Families First store, 1845 N. 12th St., candy bars are behind a caged cashier, and a small stock of large Golden Delicious apples are front and center. There were a few tomatoes in the cooler, but overall the produce stock was very limited. 
Nobody’s suggesting that better access is a panacea for changing people’s dietary decisions. Consumer education is another key, Hines and other say. But experts told us that providing more choices is a necessary first step toward improvement. 
But there’s a steep hill to climb in terms of making good quality produce widely available. 
A 2008 study by the Neighborhood Health Alliance in Lindsay Heights, for example, found that more than 65% of the neighborhood retail food outlets offered no fresh produce. ""Residents indicated that key concerns were: poor food quality, poor access to quality fresh produce and healthy food options, and a lack of transportation,"" the study found. 
""I don’t want to call it a ‘food desert,’"" Eric Gass, the Health Department’s public health research and policy director, said of Lindsay Heights. ""Food is available. It’s just not good food. There’s a term I’ve heard for that: a ‘food swamp.’"" 
Residents in the Amani neighborhood, near Lindsay Heights, who lack vehicles or can’t get a ride have to figure out how to cover a mile and a half or more to find a full-service store on the city’s north side, Tussler said. Buses are an option. 
""Think bus fare,"" Tussler said in an email to us. ""Then how much can you carry? Then think once a month you pay for a taxi. You buy case goods because they don't spoil. You freeze meat and buy Wonder Bread because it doesn't mold. Then you get milk at the corner store."" 
While access to good quality, healthier foods has improved only marginally on the north side in recent years, Tussler said, ""the south side has been a big winner."" She noted the expansion by local El Rey markets and the addition of large stores such as the Pick ‘N Save at S. 19th St. and W. National Ave. 
Overall, on this part of Tate’s claim, we heard -- and saw for ourselves -- that fruit is for sale on the north side, but not necessarily in the kind of quantities that make it as affordable or as fresh as in some other neighborhoods. And getting to the store that has what a family needs can be a challenge for some. 
The legislation, meanwhile, was pending in the state Senate as of late May 2013. The city of Milwaukee took no position on the bill. 
Our rating 
Tate, the Democratic Party official, decried the lack of healthy and affordable food options in some Milwaukee neighborhoods. ""A bag of Cheetos costs less to buy than an apple,"" Tate said, and ""good luck trying to find an apple or a banana or some sort of healthy option"" at stores there. 
He’s mostly right on the price comparison, and is partially accurate in suggesting it’s very difficult to locate fresh fruit. While fresh fruit can be found at big and some small stores, it’s more available in some low-income areas more than others, and getting there, finding it worth eating and paying for it are a challenge for some, according to experts and residents.

Kooyenga says Wisconsin's income tax system stands out nationally as progressive
","
The author of a Wisconsin income tax overhaul sees the flat tax in the Flatland to the south as a beacon for Republicans trying to ease the Badger State’s heavy tax burden on the middle class. 
""We have a long ways to go in Wisconsin,"" state Rep. Dale Kooyenga, R-Brookfield, told reporters. ""Everyone in Illinois pays 5 percent. Illinois millionaires … pay less of a rate in taxes than Wisconsin’s lower income, middle-class families."" 
Researchers deem Illinois’ personal income tax structure ""regressive"" because a uniform tax rate ultimately takes a bigger bite from lower incomes than higher ones. Wisconsin pioneered the opposite approach, a ""progressive"" system in which tax rates rise with earnings. 
Kooyenga argues change is long overdue. 
""Wisconsin was the first state to enact an income tax in 1911,"" he  wrote in a May 27, 2013 posting on the conservative Right Wisconsin website. ""The complexity of the Wisconsin tax code has exponentially grown as Madison politicians believed the tax code was their magic wand which could be used to accomplish political and social objectives."" 
His conclusion: ""As a direct result, our tax code picks winners and losers and is one of the most progressive tax codes in the country."" 
Kooyenga’s plan reduces rates and collapses several tax brackets. It comes on top of Gov. Scott Walker’s tax-cut proposal. Combined they reduce taxes by nearly $790 million over two years. 
Top earners would likely receive the majority of the $444 million in tax savings under Kooyenga’s plan, and those with modest incomes would land in the same tax bracket as very high earners, the Journal Sentinel reported. Kooyenga acknowledges that, but says everyone deserves tax relief and that the top 10 percent right now pay over 50 percent of the tax revenue in Wisconsin. 
But Kooyenga’s claim wasn’t about the impact of his plan. Rather it was about the tax system as it stands today. 
Does Wisconsin have ""one of the most progressive tax codes in the country""? 
The rankings 
Kooyenga’s plan focuses on the personal income tax, so we’ll confine our analysis to that rather than all taxes in the code. 
We found two 50-state studies comparing income tax burdens by income level, and Kooyenga cited the same research when we asked him for backup. 
A March 2013 study of 2010 tax data by the non-partisan Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence, a research organization, concluded that: 
-- Among 42 states with an income tax (and the District of Columbia), Wisconsin is the 9th most-progressive when comparing married couples with $10,000 of gross income to those with incomes of $150,000, $250,000, $500,000 and $1 million. 
-- Wisconsin’s ranking drops lower, in a range from 11th to 15th ""most progressive,"" when comparing a couple earning $35,000 to each of those four higher levels. The ranks were 11, 12, 15 and 15. Minnesota came in number 2. 
The second study cited by Kooyenga is a January 2013 examination by the nonpartisan, liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) in Washington, D.C. 
(The group is a partner organization to Citizens for Tax Justice, which has criticized the Walker and Kooyenga tax cuts as costly and regressive. Also, on May 30, 2013, ITEP released a review of Kooyenga’s plan, concluding that the top 20 percent of earners, a group with an average income of $183,000, would receive more than two-thirds of the benefit.) 
In any event, the group’s earlier 50-state study -- the one cited by Kooyenga to back up his claim -- found that Wisconsin’s income tax was the 12th most progressive in the nation. That ranking is not revealed in the report, which deals with a broader variety of state and local taxes, but the group made it available to us from its unpublished database. 
So, the two studies rank the income tax here in a range from 9th to 15th most progressive. That puts Wisconsin among the top 21 to 36 percent of ""most progressive"" income tax states, depending on the comparison point and the study. 
Of course, that’s just among the state’s that levy a personal income tax -- the tax that is the main way to add a progressive element to a tax system. 
Four states that don’t levy a personal income tax are on the ITEP’s top-10 ""most regressive"" list for their overall tax systems, so it’s safe to say Wisconsin’s income tax approach is more progressive than in those additional states that don’t even use this progressive tool. 
Of the two studies, the ITEP research is more up to date, but is limited to non-elderly taxpayers. It, unlike the Minnesota study, accounted for the effect of reductions that Walker initiated in 2011 in the earned income tax credit for low-income workers, a cut of 19 percent, or $56 million over two years. 
That change made the income tax less progressive, but we don’t know how it affected Wisconsin’s ranking vs. other states, some of whom made similar changes. 
Digging deeper 
From the ITEP study, Kooyenga highlighted tables showing that Wisconsin’s top 20 percent of earners pay an effective income tax rate considerably higher than the national average. Similarly, for the lowest 20 percent, Wisconsin’s burden is lower than the 50-state average. 
That’s true, and it demonstrates the progressive nature of the Wisconsin system. The progressive income tax offsets the regressive effect, for example, of the sales tax. 
Aside from the graduated rate structure that rises with income, the state’s sliding standard deduction is ""powerfully progressive,"" as is the itemized deduction credit, notes Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance president Todd Berry. 
But the ITEP study also shows that by the time earnings reach an average of $28,000, Wisconsin’s personal income tax bite is already over the national average for the second 20 percent. 
PolitiFact Wisconsin in November 2012 reviewed a claim by state Rep. Robin Vos that on income taxes, ""Wisconsin is one of the best places in the country to be poor but ""top 4 or 5 worst"" for middle-income earners. We rated it Mostly True. 
Wisconsin, in the 2013 ITEP study, is not singled out as at the very highest end as either progressive or regressive. 
""Unlike most states, Wisconsin allows a large capital gains tax break,"" ITEP executive director Matthew Gardner wrote in an email. ""Since the benefits of this tax break go primarily to the best-off taxpayers, the capital gains tax break makes Wisconsin’s income tax much less progressive than you would think from just looking at the tax rates."" 
Gardner said it would be reasonable to say that Wisconsin is in the upper tier of ""least regressive"" states based on its #12 ranking. 
But, in his view, ""it’s hard to describe the Wisconsin income tax -- or the tax system as a whole -- as among the ‘most progressive’ in the US."" 
In the Minnesota study, the rankings drop quite a bit when the comparison income is set at $35,000 instead of $10,000. 
The reason for that is related to the tax credits for very low earners that we mentioned earlier. Wisconsin has a prominent credit, helping to account for its progressive ranking. 
Such credits phase out as income rises, however, so those people would have a tax liability, unlike lower earners whose bill is wiped out by the credit, said Aaron Twait, research director at the Minnesota center. 
A few other states keep the credits in place at higher incomes, bumping up their ""progressive"" rating. 
Kooyenga could have balanced off some of the regressive effect of his plan by increasing tax credits for very low-income earners. 
But he notes that many workers in that category receive the credit even though they did not 
earn enough wages to have Wisconsin taxes withheld. It’s a wage supplement in the form of a refund. That, in Kooyenga’s view, is one of the inappropriate ""social objectives"" in the tax code, his office told us. 
Our rating 
PItching his plan to begin flattening the Wisconsin state income tax code, Kooyenga said Wisconsin has ""one of the most progressive tax codes in the country."" 
Kooyenga was talking about income taxes, and it’s clear from two national studies that Wisconsin’s tax is more progressive than two-thirds to four-fifths of the states that levy such a tax, depending on the study. 
So Wisconsin is clearly in the upper tier, but not in elite of the elite. 
We rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/jun/02/dale-kooyenga/kooyenga-says-wisconsins-income-taxes-stand-out-na/
"['New Jersey', 'Debt', 'Jobs', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie TV ad links big budgets, cost hikes to Barbara Buono, but is blame misplaced?
","Barbara Buono is a one-woman, out-of-control spending machine, to hear the latest TV ad from Republican Chris Christie. The ad released online May 22 links Buono, a Democratic state senator from Metuchen, with Corzine, Christie’s Democratic predecessor. Buono is Christie’s likely challenger in the November gubernatorial contest. As pictures of Corzine and Buono flash on screen during the ad, a narrator intones, ""Jon Corzine, elected governor. Teams up with Barbara Buono. $1.2  billion sales tax increase? Passed. Most spending in state history? Passed. After Buono named budget chair, taxes and fees increase 23 times in just two years. State debt? Up $13.4 billion. Unemployment? Doubled."" This ad is like others from the governor’s re-election campaign that try linking Buono with Corzine: strong on bluster, weak on context. While the ad doesn’t come right out and blame Buono for these increases, the implication is there. Let’s go back to the start of Corzine’s tenure. The Democrat became governor in 2005 and served one term before being defeated by Christie. We’re not sure how Corzine ""teamed up"" with Buono since she was already on her third term as a state senator when he was first elected to state government. Further, the chairmanship of legislative committees is determined by the president in the Senate and the speaker in the Assembly – not the governor. Also, Buono was neither Corzine’s Senate president nor his lieutenant governor, which would have made them more of a ‘team.’ Next, let’s review the increases mentioned in the ad. In 2006, Corzine proposed increasing New Jersey’s sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent, claiming the hike would generate more than $1 billion in revenue and help close a $4.5 billion budget gap. Buono was one of 22 senators to approve the increase, which went into effect that July. Then came creation of the fiscal year 2007-2008 budget, which was proposed at $33.4 billion -- the largest state budget in history to date. Each of Christie’s budgets since he’s been in office has been below that total. Buono became chair of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee in January 2008 and served through 2009, meaning she led that panel in reviewing and editing a budget before submitting it to Corzine for approval. Buono voted in favor of the budget. Corzine had final approval over it. And the situation is similar for the ad claim about 23 increases in taxes and fees during the two years that Buono chaired the Senate budget panel. Among the votes that Buono supported: increasing the cigarette tax, increasing the vehicle registration fee by $7, and increasing the income tax rate in various brackets. So Buono has responsibility for these increases since she voted in favor of them, but she’s not the only legislator to do so. The ad also is correct that state debt increased more than $13 billion during the two years of Buono’s chairmanship. But Christie calling her out for that is disingenuous since state debt has climbed an additional $13 billion from 2010 -- Christie’s first year in office -- to 2012, according to the State Debt Report for Fiscal Year 2012. Finally, let’s look at unemployment figures for the period cited by the ad: January 2008 to January 2010. Looking strictly at raw numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of unemployed in New Jersey more than doubled from 208,729 in January 2008 to 442,441 two years later. But Christie’s team forgot something: New Jersey was deep in the recession, which the U.S. Bureau of Economic Research has defined as beginning in December 2007 and ending in June 2009. Employment losses continued mounting in the months after the recession ended. Consequently, one New Jersey senator can’t bare the full blame for an economic collapse that gripped the state and nation for several years. ""As the architect of Jon Corzine’s budgets, Barbara Buono was central to those disastrous policies that brough New Jersey to the brink of catastrophe,"" Christie for Governor spokesman Kevin Roberts said in a press release that he referred us to about the ad. Buono for Governor spokesman David Turner blasted the ad’s claims. ""Governor Christie's blatantly misleading claims are laughable,"" Turner said in an e-mail. ""Senator Buono voted for commonsense measures to hold lawbreakers accountable, including fees to reduce the cost of collecting child support, tougher fines against polluters and increased penalties for improperly storing explosives. With more than 400,000 people unemployed and property taxes up nearly 20 percent, it's no surprise that he has resorted to purposely distorting Senator Buono's record."" Our ruling A Christie TV ad claims, ""Jon Corzine, elected governor. Teams up with Barbara Buono. $1.2  billion sales tax increase? Passed. Most spending in state history? Passed. After Buono named budget chair, taxes and fees increase 23 times in just two years. State debt? Up $13.4 billion. Unemployment? Doubled."" Most of the ad’s claims are correct but imply that Buono is to blame for things such as a sales tax increase, billions in debt and skyrocketing unemployment in two years – during a recession, to boot. All of these resulted from the collective actions of a legislative body – not one person. Also, sharing a political affiliation and chairing a committee didn’t necessarily make Buono and Corzine a ‘team.’ Therefore, we rate the ad Half True.

R.I. Treasurer candidate Frank Caprio says pension investment fees have more than quadrupled under incumbent Gina Raimondo
","
How much money should you spend to make money? That question, which every investor faces, has moved to the forefront in Rhode Island since the State Investment Commission, at the urging of General Treasurer Gina Raimondo, started moving 15 percent of state pension money into hedge funds. 
Those funds not only charge a very high fee for managing the account, they also collect a ""performance"" bonus -- often 20 to 25 percent -- from the profits. 
Raimondo's office says that's worth the price because hedge funds protect the pension fund from the type of drastic dip in value seen when the economy fell into a recession in 2008. 
Critics contend that investment expenses charged by those funds, combined with the risk they pose, make them a very bad choice. 
One such critic is Frank Caprio, who served as treasurer from 2007 through 2010 and, after an unsuccessful run for governor, is seeking his old job back. 
On the May 19 edition of the WJAR-TV program ""10 News Conference,"" Caprio said he worked hard as treasurer to reduce the fees paid by the pension fund. 
""And lo and behold, after I left office, a national group did a study of all the pension funds. And Rhode Island ranked at the right end, the high end of that study, paying some of the lowest fees in the country, per capita,"" he said. 
""The fee structure of hedge funds is much different than index fund managers, which are the type of managers we had a lot of money with. So the fees have gone up from about $12 million annually to about $50 million,"" Caprio said. 
That's a big increase. We thought we'd check the numbers. 
We turned to both Raimondo's office and to Caprio. 
The former treasurer sent us the July 25, 2012, edition of the Maryland Policy Report, which ranked states based on the Wall Street fees they paid. For Rhode Island, it lists management fees of $13.1 million for the 2010 fiscal year. That's an expense ratio of $2.15 for every $1,000 invested. The U.S. average was $4.09 per $1,000. Only 10 other states paid a lower ratio. 
Raimondo's office, along with other documents, confirmed the $13.1 million figure, which is a bit higher than the ""about $12 million"" cited by Caprio. 
When we asked Caprio for the source of the $50 million comment, he referred us to minutes from the April 24, 2013, meeting of the state Investment Commission. 
Stephen Nesbitt, chief executive officer of Cliffwater LLC, one of the state's management consultants, is cited as saying that with the inclusion of performance fund hedge fees, the state is paying an expense ratio of 0.58 percent. That would be $5.80 for every $1,000 invested. Because the fund had $7.78 billion on April 30, that would equal $45.1 million in annual fees being paid, Caprio said. 
That's a bit lower than his ""about $50 million."" 
But these numbers don't begin to tell the whole story. 
The year cited by Caprio touting his own performance occurred during the financial crisis, when the value of the state's pension fund was depressed. For that reason alone, investment fees (also known as management and performance fees) would be lower. 
(The expense was $13.1 million for 2010, but it was $20.3 million the previous year and $28.6 million the year before that. Caprio said the big 2010 reduction ""was not because of market going down. My team moved over $2 billion out of active money managers who charged high fees to index funds that charge low fees."") 
Raimondo's office contends that such direct fees are actually lower under her current administration -- $12.7 million during the last fiscal year and $15.1 million the year before that. 
(Management fees cover the basic services for handling an account. They are calculated based on a percentage of what the fund is worth and paid whether the value of the fund has risen or fallen.) 
Yet it gets even more complicated. 
The direct management fees charged by traditional investments are only a small part of the actual cost of administering the state's portfolio. 
Other types of investments, such as those hedge funds, charge indirect fees, which are removed from the fund balance before it is reported, making them harder to compile. 
Hedge funds charge both an indirect management fee and an indirect performance fee, which is typically about 20 percent of the fund's profit, assessed annually. 
The total for the fees paid under Raimondo has tripled because the current treasurer, for the first time, has begun reporting both direct and indirect fees. It's one of only six states doing so, according to Cliffwater. 
How much are we talking about? 
In May, Raimondo's office released an accounting of all investment expenses for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2012. They totaled $46 million, including staff expenses; $32.5 million of that went for indirect fund expenses and $13.5 million for direct fees. 
How high were the indirect expenses during the year Caprio was paying out $13.1 million in direct expenses? 
That's hard to tease out because they haven't been reported, and few states do. 
The bottom line: Raimondo contends they were higher than Caprio stated. Caprio disagrees. We can’t determine who’s right because they weren’t reported in past years. 
Our ruling 
Frank Caprio said that since Gina Raimondo took office, investment fees on the state's pension portfolio ""have gone up from about $12 million annually to about $50 million."" 
State records show that, at first blush, the numbers were $13.1 million in 2010 and $46.0 million now. He's not on the money, but close. 
But it's not clear if Caprio has given a complete accounting of his expenses for fiscal 2010. Both Caprio and Raimondo say some data is unavailable for that year, so that element of truth remains unresolved.   
Because Caprio's comparison is partially accurate but lacks important details and elements of context, we rate it Half True.

Did Kurt Schrader vote against widely supported Keystone XL project?
","The communications office of the National Republican Congressional Committee isn’t letting up on Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore. It’s recently peppered him with criticism over the sequester and President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul. This time, the issue is construction of a controversial pipeline that would carry crude oil from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast for refinement.   A May 23, 2013, press release targeted Schrader for voting against H.R. 3, a bill that would allow TransCanada to start building the Keystone XL Pipeline without approval from President Barack Obama. Specifically, the legislation skips further environmental review and removes barriers to construction.   ""With nearly 75 percent of Americans supportive of the construction of the pipeline, Schrader needs to explain to Oregon families why he voted against this needed project,"" the release states.   Three-quarters of Americans want this project to happen? We know surveys can sometimes use scurrilous, squirrelly language, so we thought we’d take a look-see.  Plus, while Schrader is a veterinarian who loves animals, the man is no tree-hugging environmentalist. Does he oppose construction?   Let’s tackle the 75 percent statistic first. The NRCC relies on a survey conducted by Nanos Research that was the subject of an April 2013 news report in the Wall Street Journal.   Here’s the survey question: Based on what you have heard about the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline between Canada and the U.S., do you support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose or oppose the US/Canadian government approving the project?   Of Americans, 52 percent said they support the project and 22 percent said they somewhat support it.   Nanos, a respected independent polling firm, isn’t the only one to find that a majority of respondents in the United States support construction. An April 2013 Pew Research poll found 66 percent in favor with 23 percent opposed. The poll found broader support among Republicans and independents; Democrats are more divided.   We checked with Daniel Kessler, a media campaigner with 350.org, which opposes Keystone. The Nanos polling question looked sound to him, although he wanted to remind readers that other surveys show high support for clean energy alternatives and efforts to combat global warming.   Now, let’s address the second part of the statement. As we stated earlier, H.R. 3 eliminates the need for White House approval to start the project.   It’s undisputed that Schrader voted against the bill. Nineteen House Democrats joined majority Republicans to send the bill to the Senate, where it sits. No House Democrat from Oregon voted for the legislation. In fact, the NRCC targeted a number of Democrats with the same press release, including Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore.   A spokesman for Schrader said the congressman supports construction in principle, just not the way Republicans are going about it. ""To say that he does not support the construction on the pipeline is false,"" wrote spokesman Cody Tucker in an email to PolitiFact Oregon.   Annie Clark with the NRCC disagrees. She cited four other times where Schrader voted against construction. ""Schrader voted against constructing or expediting construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline every chance he had,"" she wrote to PolitiFact Oregon.   We checked his other votes. The legislation sought to force Obama to act or bypassed him altogether in approving Keystone. Loads of House Democrats voted against the bills.   Schrader did vote against H.R. 3, which eliminates further regulatory hurdles, eliminates presidential input and essentially gives congressional go-ahead for construction. This statement by itself we would rate Half True.   It is partially accurate in that Schrader did vote against the legislation, which authorizes the project. But it is missing significant details in that Schrader supports construction in principle, just not this particular way to get there. Had the NRCC said that Schrader voted against the bill -- as opposed to the project -- the statement would be True.   The NRCC is accurate in citing that nearly 75 percent of Americans support construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. The Nanos survey is solid, as is a Pew Research poll that showed two-thirds support.   With the polling part True and the project part Half True, that brings our ruling to Mostly True for this two-part statement.   (If you want to leave a comment, go to http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/06/did_kurt_schrader_vote_against.html#incart_m-rpt-2)",/factchecks/2013/jun/01/national-republican-congressional-committee/did-kurt-schrader-vote-against-widely-supported-ke/

Rick Perry says 13 Texas universities have announced or implemented a $10,000 degree
","
Texas’ governor threw out a challenge in 2011 that some in higher education said was impossible to meet. Two years later, Rick Perry says it’s underway. 
A May 17, 2013, press release from Perry’s office said, ""The governor has renewed his challenge for institutions to offer bachelor's degrees for $10,000 or less, including books. So far, 13 institutions have announced or implemented a $10,000 degree."" 
Perry first called for such degrees in his Feb. 8, 2011, state-of-the-state address. Public skepticism included a claim from the chairman of the Travis County Democratic Party that ""nobody in higher education believes that is even possible,"" which we rated False, finding not only disagreement but existing $10,000 degrees in Texas and elsewhere. 
In 2012, the Austin American-Statesman reported on nine programs that universities had already announced or identified in response to Perry’s challenge. The Aug. 5, 2012, news story said that most of the programs relied on scholarships, financial aid and students amassing credit hours in advance at a lower-tuition institution or for free in high school. Also, few included the cost of books in the $10,000 price tag, the story said. 
  
In 2013-14, the average annual full-time tuition and mandatory fees at a Texas public university are estimated at $7,600, with books and supplies averaging another $1,200, according to Dominic Chavez, a spokesman for the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. Put another way, the average four-year tab for tuition, fees, books and supplies, provided these estimates do not change, would be $35,200. 
So, how many institutions have made $10,000 degree programs a reality since 2011? 
Perry spokesman Josh Havens emailed us a list of 13 universities: 
University of Texas at Arlington 
University of Texas of the Permian Basin 
University of Texas at Brownsville 
Tarleton State University 
Texas A&M University-Commerce 
Texas A&M International University 
Texas A&M University-San Antonio 
Texas A&M University-Texarkana 
Angelo State University 
Sul Ross State University 
University of Houston-Clear Lake 
University of Houston-Downtown 
University of Houston-Victoria 
Chavez emailed us descriptions of each program compiled from news reports and schools’ announcements. We verified information with each university’s representatives or website and got more details. 
While we confirmed that each university has a program that offers a degree or degrees with a price tag of $10,500 or less, here’s the big catch: Seven require students to earn up to 87 college credit hours elsewhere and don’t include those costs in the sticker price. (Two require 75 community college hours but include that cost in their price tag.) 
The UT-Arlington program, for example, is a partnership with two local school districts in which students earn 24 hours of college credit in high school, move on to get an associate’s degree at Tarrant County College and then finish their bachelor’s degree at UTA. If they manage all that and keep a 3.25 grade point average while getting the associate’s degree, spokeswoman Kristin Sullivan told us, they will get a scholarship that pays all UTA tuition and fees over $10,000. 
So, only four universities offer programs where students can start with no hours and earn 120 hours at the university for $10,500 or less. And one of those is an online-only degree that can range from $5,000 to $14,000 depending on how many hours a student can get credit for based on work and other experience (at A&M-Commerce). 
Also, the online A&M-Commerce program is the only one of the 13 that covers the cost of books. 
Some of the 13 programs offer limited choice or very specific degrees, such as the bachelor’s in information technology with an emphasis on information security at Texas A&M-San Antonio. Others give wider choices -- for example, any degree offered at UT-Arlington. 
The two programs that require community college but include that tuition in the sticker price: 
  
UH-Clear Lake: 75 hours at a community college and 45 hours at the university -- costing a total $10,014 to $10,372, depending on the college attended and including $3,835 in Pell grants -- for a bachelor of applied science in early childhood education, health care services or information technology. 
UH-Downtown: The same 75/45 split of hours and $3,559 in Pell grants (that’s the average Pell amount awarded to UHD students) yield a cost of $9,116 to $9,801, depending on the college attended, for a bachelor of applied arts and science degree in applied administration or a bachelor of science degree in interdisciplinary studies. 
The four programs in which students can amass up to 120 hours entirely from the university that will be issuing their diploma: 
  
UT-Permian Basin: For bachelor of science degrees in chemistry, computer science, geology, information systems or math, students in the university’s Texas Science Scholar Program pay ""$10,000 in tuition and fees for the four-year curriculum,"" not including books, according to the program’s web page. 
A&M-Commerce: Up to 120 online hours result in a bachelor of applied science degree in organizational leadership. Students can submit equivalent experience for up to 90 hours of those credits, according to Mary Hendrix, vice president of student access and success. That variability means the cost ""will range from $5,000 to $14,000,"" including books, Hendrix told us by email. 
Angelo State: Qualifying students can get a $5,000-per-year scholarship that reduces tuition and fees to $9,974 for a bachelor of interdisciplinary studies degree, according to an Oct. 3, 2012, press release. Texas residents with certain scores or better on one of two college admissions tests (27 on the ACT or 1220 on combined SAT) qualify for the program and the scholarship. University spokesman Tom Nurre said the cost does not include books, and noted transfer students can join if they have a 3.5 or better grade point average. 
UH-Victoria: By getting scholarships and completing college in three years, students can earn a $9,999 bachelor’s degree in English, history, communication, psychology, Spanish or criminal justice, said a Jan. 11, 2013, press release. That assumes a UHV scholarship for $1,845 a year plus ""the average Pell grant of $3,593 per year""; other scholarships can ""help defer costs of books and living expenses."" 
Our ruling 
Perry said 13 Texas institutions had announced or implemented a $10,000 degree. 
That count draws on a state-researched list. By our analysis, however, only four programs offer degrees earned entirely at the university whose name is on the diploma for $10,500 or less. Two more universities expect students to attend community college first but pay a total of $10,372 or less at both institutions. 
That leaves seven universities that expect students to earn their $10,000 degrees after corraling up to 87 college credits in other ways that presumably cost additional money. Several also require students following the $10,000 degree plans to have income-based Pell grants or to qualify for other scholarships. 
These realities are more complicated than the governor suggested. We rate his statement, which has an element of truth, as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/may/31/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-13-texas-universities-have-announc/
"['Environment', 'National', 'Climate Change', 'Federal Budget', 'Infrastructure', 'Alan Grayson']","
Alan Grayson says bill clearing way for Keystone XL pipeline is an earmark
","Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., recently took an unusual approach to opposing the Keystone XL pipeline, a 1,700-mile project to bring heavy crude from Canada’s oil-rich tar sands to the Gulf of Mexico. He says it’s an earmark, and earmarks aren’t in line with current House rules. ""The Keystone XL Pipeline deal is an earmark to a foreign corporation, plain and simple,"" Grayson said in a news release. ""House Republicans claim to have been incredibly keen on ridding our legislative system of congressional earmarks — yet here they are — hypocritically sneaking one in for a foreign corporation. They seem to believe that the ‘no earmarks’ rule does not apply to them. That’s just unacceptable."" For years, environmentalists have battled pipeline supporters over the construction of the new pipeline. This year, supporters turned to the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives to essentially waive a variety of regulatory hurdles that have so far delayed the project’s groundbreaking. A bill, H.R. 3, would effectively sidestep the key governmental reviews delaying the project, which is to be built by TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P., a Canadian company. H.R. 3 declares that a presidential permit is not required to advance the project. It also clears the project under the the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, the Mineral Leasing Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, among other laws; and prevents the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator from blocking the project. On May 21, 2013, as H.R. 3 was moving toward a vote in the House, Grayson wrote a letter to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, in which he argued that the bill was an earmark. We were intrigued by Grayson’s argument and wanted to look in detail at whether the Keystone project fit the definition of an earmark. What is an earmark? Generally speaking, an earmark is a requirement that money approved by Congress be spent in a specific way at the request of a lawmaker. Critics say earmarks serve the interest of a particular congressional district or constituent group rather than the national good. That's why congressional Republicans -- and President Barack Obama -- have promised to curb their use, with some degree of success. To make his case that H.R. 3 was an earmark, Grayson pointed to the section of the House’s rules that define what constitutes an earmark. House rules are written by the chamber’s majority party every two years and approved, typically on a party-line vote, when a new Congress is sworn in. House rules do not have the force of law, but they are binding for the procedures used in the chamber. The current version of the House rules says earmarks are a specific authorization of spending, targeted to a specific purpose or place, and made without a competitive award process. Here’s the exact definition: ""For the purpose of this clause, the term ‘congressional earmark’ means a provision or report language included primarily at the request of a Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, or Senator providing, authorizing or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a contract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or Congressional district, other than through a statutory or administrative formula-driven or competitive award process."" To sharpen his case to Boehner, Grayson streamlined this language by removing some of the extra words. Grayson’s shortened earmark definition was: ""a provision … included primarily at the request of a Member ... providing (or) authorizing … a .. grant ... to an entity … other than through a statutory or administrative … or competitive award process."" H.R. 3, Grayson wrote, provides a special benefit, ""outside of established statutory, administrative or competitive award processes, and it does so to only one entity -- explicitly named in this bill, ‘TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P.’"" Grayson went on to argue that the ""requirement that this provision be included ‘primarily at the request of a Member’ is surely satisfied by the act of a Member drafting and offering this bill. It was the conscious choice of a Member from the state of Nebraska to offer this legislation, as well as explicitly mention Nebraska or Nebraskans six separate times, while no other state receives a single mention."" We checked with several experts on House procedure to see what they thought of Grayson’s argument. They were not convinced. They said their concerns go beyond H.R. 3’s superficial differences with classic earmarks, though it has some of those, too. Typically, earmarks are narrow provisions of larger bills inserted and supported by a small number of lawmakers and advancing a highly localized purpose, such as a local road or construction project. By contrast, H.R. 3 is a stand-alone bill, it has been co-sponsored by 134 House members and it would clear the way for a project that runs from the Canadian border to the Gulf of Mexico. But the more important problem, the experts said, is that the bill does not affect federal spending -- something the House rule explicitly requires. Grayson, they said, got around this by dropping most of the following clause from his streamlined definition: ""providing, authorizing or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority."" Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee who currently directs the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, cited the Congressional Budget Office in arguing that H.R. 3 ""comes nowhere near being an earmark as defined by House rules, period."" When CBO -- Congress’ nonpartisan fiscal-analysis arm -- weighed the bill’s fiscal impact, it found that ""implementing H.R. 3 would have no significant impact on the federal budget. Based on information from affected agencies, CBO estimates that the proposed changes to administrative procedures would not significantly affect federal spending for such activities relative to current law. The bill would not affect direct spending or revenues."" Roy T. Meyers, political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County who has studied budgeting and earmarks, said he was ""astonished to see how (Grayson) selectively and misleadingly edited the definition of earmark, then compounded the fault by drawing a bizarre inference regarding the bill's effective approval of a permit. This bill is about administrative regulation, or more accurately, the lack of it. The earmark definition restricts its application to spending, and lists different types of spending, including grants. Grayson cuts the words on spending and the other types of spending besides grants and replaces these missing words with ellipses, which completely changes the meaning."" Two other experts -- Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, and Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist -- agreed with this analysis. ""There has to be a dollar figure associated with the provision, and this bill does not have that,"" Ellis said. Grayson’s office stands by its classification of the bill as an earmark, arguing that the House voted on a measure that amounts to a special favor to one entity, for one project, and that was requested by a Member of Congress, Rep. Lee Terry, R-Neb. Despite Meyers’ deep skepticism of Grayson’s claim that the bill is an earmark under House rules, he said Grayson has a point. ""Earmarks have been criticized, often justifiably, for not being subject to sufficient scrutiny on their policy merits,"" Myers said. ""Unlike most research grants that are subject to demanding peer reviews, or many contracts that must undergo extensive agency review and competitive bidding, earmarks are awarded only after cursory reviews, typically by committee staff. Congress substitutes its judgment on a particular case, cutting agencies and other experts out of the loop."" The similarity here, Meyers said, is that the bill prevents agencies from doing their job -- to assess the impacts of a proposed project. Still, that’s not the same thing as arguing that H.R. 3 actually qualifies as an earmark under House rules. ""Grayson would be smarter to argue that the bill violates the spirit, not the letter, of the earmark moratorium and the philosophy that supposedly backs it,"" Meyers said. We should note that the House -- the only body that can officially determine whether a bill fits the earmark definition under the chamber’s rules -- has not passed judgment on Grayson’s claim. When Grayson raised his argument on the House floor, the lawmaker chairing the proceedings ruled that Grayson’s request was improper, dismissing it before allowing any discussion of the substance of Grayson’s complaint. Grayson’s office added that they have not received ruling determination on the merits of his arguments from the House parliamentarian’s office. This result is not surprising. Grayson wasn’t going into court to argue to an impartial judge; in the House, whichever party happens to be in the majority controls the chamber to a near-dictatorial degree. And to nobody’s surprise, the measure passed by a 241-175 margin when it came to a vote on May 22, 2013. No Republican broke ranks by opposing it, while 19 Democrats sided with the majority in supporting the bill. Because the Democratic-controlled Senate is unlikely to agree, the bill is not expected to become law. Our ruling Grayson said a bill to advance the Keystone XL Pipeline ""is an earmark"" under House rules. Officially, the House -- the only entity that can make this ruling -- has not rendered a judgment on Grayson’s claim. But several experts on earmarks that we checked with were unanimous that Grayson was wrong by the clear language of the rule. The House’s definition of ""earmark"" is based on the notion that the provision in question spends federal money, which the bill in question does not -- a difference that Grayson carefully edited out when he made his argument to Boehner. We rate Grayson’s claim False.",/factchecks/2013/may/31/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-says-bill-clearing-way-keystone-xl-pi/
"['Ohio', 'Regulation', 'Rob Portman']","
U.S. Sen. Rob Portman says the Obama administration has put out more major rules than other recent administrations
","
Because we deal with lots of loose rhetoric at PolitiFact Ohio, we’re attracted like a magnet to any claim that tries to actually quantify a political or ideological point. Ohio U.S. Sen. Rob Portman delivered such a tidbit during a conference call with Ohio reporters on May 23. 
Portman was explaining a bill he co-introduced that could require additional cost-benefit analysis and allow more business flexibility before new federal regulations and rules could be issued. Portman says too many government regulations are imposed without a commonsense assessment of their burden on businesses and jobs. And he said that President Barack Obama’s administration has put out ""more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times."" 
We won’t attempt to assess whether current and pending regulation of the environment, worker and food safety,  healthcare, wildlife or fuel efficiency are good or government overkill. But has the Obama administration finalized more of these ""major"" rules than other recent presidents? That part of the claim is measurable and has, in fact, been examined by groups of all political stripes, all using the same sources of government data. 
If all regulations were counted, Obama’s record would be nowhere near Portman’s description, especially considering a sizeable flurry of rulemaking during Bill Clinton’s first two years, as the liberal group OMB Watch, now known as the Center for Effective Government, said in a report last September.  In fact, when 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney claimed that federal regulations quadrupled under Obama, PolitiFact ruled it False. 
But Portman said ""major"" rules."" ""Major"" has a specific meaning when used by the government in this context. It means any rule with an economic impact of at least $100 million. And the White House Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, keeps track of these very rules, as does the Government Accountability Office. OMB calls them ""economically significant"" rules, which also has a distinct definition but is so close to ""major"" that there is no need to split hairs here. 
We looked at three analyses of major or economically significant rules, all broken down by year and presidency and all using OMB data.  One was provided by Portman’s Senate staff, which is familiar with the data because Portman used to run OMB. Another was from the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University, headed by Susan Dudley, a former regulatory affairs administrator at OMB. A third was from the Center for Effective Government. 
Portman’s office compared rules that were finalized in the first three years of Obama’s tenure with the first three of Clinton’s and George W. Bush’s. To guard against counting rules finalized by one administration but published by another, it excluded those that were published in the first few weeks of an incoming president’s term. Portman’s staff counted only executive branch departments and agencies and not those of independent agencies that do not report to the president. 
It found 162 major rules for Obama, 115 for the same period under Bush, and 135 for the same period under Clinton. 
A similar analysis by George Washington University’s Regulatory Studies Center had a similar conclusion, though the raw numbers were slightly different from Portman’s because of a technical variation in the timeframes counted. Among other things, the analysis counted every year the presidents served, allowing for comparisons of first and second terms for Clinton and Bush and the full four years of Obama’s first term. 
This made no substantive difference in terms of Portman’s claim. It showed that Obama still had more economically significant rules -- 217 in his first four years, compared with the next highest, 190, in Bush’s second term. 
Finally, there was the data from the Center for Effective Government, nee OMB Watch. Last September, it examined new regulations since 1992, and found the level fairly constant across presidencies, save for Clinton’s first years. But when it came to regulations labeled as economically significant, Obama’s record for the first 42 months of his presidency was 38 percent higher than the comparable period of Bush’s first term and 36 percent higher than the comparable period in Clinton’s. 
In an interview and in her report, Randy Rabinowitz, director of regulatory policy at the Center for Effective Government, cautioned that some of these comparisons can be misleading because the ""major"" rule threshold of $100 million has not changed since 1978, despite inflation. A rule costing $100 million in 1993, the first year of Clinton’s presidency, would cost $161 million today, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ online inflation calculator. We know of no analysis of regulations that has taken this into account. 
Rabinowitz also noted that many regulations grow directly out of laws passed by Congress or ordered by courts, so presidents are not merely riding roughshod over the will of lawmakers or the public. Some of Obama’s biggest rules resulted from court rulings dating to Bush, with courts requiring environmental regulation after Bush balked. 
But Obama’s share of these or similar statutory or judicially required rules -- 48 percent of all the rules his administration finalized -- was not much different from the share Clinton had to deal with in his first term, nor the share Bush had in his second term. 
This doesn’t change the facts or statistics as stated by Portman: The Obama administration has put out ""more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times."" We rate his claim True.",/factchecks/2013/may/31/rob-portman/us-sen-rob-portman-says-obama-administration-has-p/
"['Oregon', 'Children', 'Education', 'Oregon PTA']","
Does Oregon have the third-largest class size in the nation?
","
Advocates for school funding love to use statistics to draw attention to their cause and the Oregon PTA caught PolitiFact Oregon’s eye earlier this month with a juicy stat. 
In the group’s May 2013 newsletter, the PTA wrote that ""Oregon has the third largest class size in the nation."" 
With teacher layoffs in the headlines, we figured the state’s classrooms were probably experiencing some crowding, but third in the nation? We wanted to check that out. 
We asked Otto Schell, legislative director for the Oregon PTA, where the ranking came from. He said a 2013 report compiled by the National Education Association, the country’s largest teacher union, ranked Oregon third. 
""It’s a dubious honor to be in that top tier,"" Schell said. 
We looked it up and there was Oregon, ranked behind California and Utah. 
The NEA looked at the ratio of students to teachers to figure out the ranking. This isn’t the same as class size, which is different from the student-teacher ratio and is harder to measure. The average class size is always bigger than the pupil-teacher ratio, mainly because some teachers have planning periods and others work with small groups of students who have special needs, forcing the typical teacher to take on larger classes. 
A national headcount classroom to classroom would be a daunting data collection effort. Instead, researchers rely on staffing ratios to compare states since there’s a direct relationship between the student-teacher ratio and class size. Because of that, the two are often bandied around interchangeably. 
Oregon’s student-teacher ratio in the fall of 2011, according to the NEA, was 20.2. 
OK, so Oregon ranked third on the list according to data collected by the NEA. We wondered what other sources of data say about Oregon’s student-teacher ratio. 
The state of Oregon calculates student-teacher ratios a little differently, using an average of full-time-equivalent teaching positions and student enrollment across the school year. The state number is higher, with 21.3 students per teacher. 
That would still rank Oregon behind Utah and California in the NEA rankings. 
We wondered if the state calculation was consistently higher. Turns out it was, but not by much. Going back to the 2008-2009 school year, the statewide average student-teacher ratio was 19.1. The NEA pegged Oregon at 18.9. 
We also checked in on the United States Department of Education’s database of school statistics. The measure for the 2011-2012 school year isn’t available until June, so we looked at past data from the feds to see how it measured up against the NEA’s Oregon numbers. 
Historical federal data lined up closely -- but not exactly -- with the state numbers we found. Oregon fared poorly in the federal ranking. In the 2008-09 school year, the state had the fifth-largest student-teacher ratio. That ranking rose to third in 2009-10 and dropped back to fourth in the 2010-11 school year. 
So overall, three data sets produced very similar results about Oregon’s student-teacher ratios, all of which say the state has one of the highest student-teacher ratios in the United States. We rate the statement True.

Professor says United Kingdom has unarmed police force and gun fatality rate 40 times lower than in U.S.
","
The Rhode Island Board of Education voted on May 23, 2013, to authorize its two colleges and the University of Rhode Island to arm their campus police if they so chose. 
Prior to the vote, as the board and the General Assembly were considering the issue, URI Prof. Peter Nightingale expressed his opposition. 
In a commentary published May 8 on RIFuture.org,  Nightingale wrote that the proposal came out of ""little more than violence and fear-enhancing recommendations."" He wrote that having armed police can lead, out of fear, to shooting unarmed people. 
And he drew this comparison: ""The UK has an unarmed police force and a firearm fatality rate that is 40 times lower per capita than in the U.S."" 
We wanted to know whether he got his facts right. We tried to contact Nightingale, who teaches physics, but he did not return phone messages or e-mails. 
Anyone who read about the recent knife attack on a British soldier in London, in which the accused assailants were eventually shot by armed police, might immediately question the first part of the statement. 
So we checked to see what British news accounts, police department information and other documents would show about whether the police in the United Kingdom are unarmed. 
A BBC News Magazine article, published online in September 2012 and headlined ""Why British police don’t have guns,"" said that ""to most inhabitants of the UK -- with the notable exception of Northern Ireland -- it is a normal, unremarkable state of affairs that most front-line officers do not carry guns."" 
Most, the article said. It goes on to say that ""each police force has its own firearms unit."" 
Then we found statistics from the Home Office, a government department in the United Kingdom that is responsible for everything from issuing passports, to reducing crime, to dealing with threat of terrorism, indicated that there are ""authorized firearms officers"" throughout the United Kingdom. In the year ending March 31, 2011, there were 6,653 such officers in England and Wales -- about five percent of the total -- down from 6,979 the previous year. 
Most but not all the police in Scotland do not regularly carry firearms, according to Police-Information.co.UK, a site for those involved in law enforcement in the United Kingdom. 
And the number of times armed officers fired their guns in a year in England and Wales, according to the figures reported by the government, can sometimes be counted on one hand. 
During 2010-2011, police ""discharged a conventional firearm in three incidents,"" a drop from six such incidents in 2009-2010, according to data published by the British Parliament. 
In the year ending March 31, 2011, the use of armed officers was authorized in 17,209 operations in England and Wales. Of that total, the Metropolitan Police -- known as the Met -- who cover metropolitan London, were authorized to have armed officers in 4,672 operations. 
The Metropolitan Police, according to its website, has a Specialist Firearm Command, known as SCO19,  which ""provides firearms-related support to our unarmed colleagues."" 
""When the officers first arrive they will make an immediate assessment. If an armed containment is deemed necessary to isolate an armed suspect from the public, then two of the crew will deploy leaving one to control the incident, calling for further armed support and liaising with the local senior police officer,"" the Metropolitan Police website states. ""All these officers are personally armed with 'Glock' 17 self-loading pistols and two of the officers have access to 'Heckler and Koch' MP5 carbines."" 
And, the Metropolitan Police site adds, the force has specialist firearms officers who ""undergo advanced firearms training and are also available 24 hours a day."" 
Next, we looked at the second part: that the United Kingdom firearm fatality rate is 40 times lower per capita than in the United States. 
Gunpolicy.org, a firearm safety database hosted by the Sydney School of Public Health in Australia and partly co-funded by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, keeps data on gun deaths by nation. In 2011, the rate of gun deaths of all kinds, including suicide, was 10.3 per 100,000 population in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the rate was 0.25 per 100,000. 
That is indeed 40 times less than the rate in the U.S. So Nightingale’s figure checked out. 
(The gap is even wider for ""gun homicides"": in 2011, the United Kingdom’s rate was 0.04 per 100,000 people, 90 times less than the 3.6 per 100,000 in the United States.) 
Our ruling 
Peter Nightingale, a University of Rhode Island professor, wrote that ""the UK has an unarmed police force and a firearm fatality rate that is 40 times lower per capita than in the U.S."" 
It’s true that some police officers in the United Kingdom are armed, but it’s a very small percentage. The vast majority are unarmed. 
And Nightingale is on target in saying that there are far fewer gun deaths in the United Kingdom than in the United States. 
On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/may/31/peter-nightingale/university-rhode-island-professor-says-united-king/

Too much value placed on one report about $1 coins
","
You have to spend money to make money. And one former Georgia lawmaker offers that advice to the federal government. 
Charlie Smith, a former state representative from St. Mary’s, says if the U.S. really wants to save money, it would replace the $1 bill with the not-so-popular $1 coin. Smith, now an attorney with a Brunswick firm, has been beating this drum for years. He kept the momentum going this month in a newspaper article. 
Smith told a Brunswick News reporter that the federal government could save $500 million a year by circulating $1 coins instead of $1 bills, and that there were four studies to support the savings claim. 
At PolitiFact, we’re fond of money, be it paper or coin. So Smith’s savings claim was intriguing. We decided to investigate further. 
During his 10 years in the state Legislature, Smith was a floor leader for then-Gov. Roy Barnes. These days he’s still leading, but he admits his coin cause is almost unwinnable. 
""They’ve started calling me Charlie ‘Don Quixote’ Smith because I’m fighting windmills,"" he told us about his campaign to phase out $1 bills. 
Smith said he was slightly misquoted in the Brunswick News article. He did say the government could save $500 million a year with the $1 coins, but that amount was cited in just one study. And since then the savings figure has been revised downward. 
The studies that Smith references are those done by the independent, nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office, which works for Congress and acts as a watchdog for how the federal government spends taxpayers’ money. 
The GAO has released several reports over the past decade on the net benefit to the government of replacing the $1 bill with a $1 coin. A report released in 2000 included the $500 million annual savings figure that Smith mentions. But since that year, the GAO studies have estimated less in annual savings. 
Last year, in testimony before a congressional committee, the GAO estimated a savings of about $4.4 billion over 30 years, or an average of about $150 million per year. It also repeated a recommendation that the dollar bill be phased out over a four-year transition period. 
The savings included in the studies is based on economics. Coins last longer than paper bills, and dollar coins don’t cost more than they are worth to produce (for example, it costs more than twice the face value of the penny and nickel to produce them). 
The life span of a dollar coin is 30 years. On the other hand, it costs 5.4 cents to produce every $1 bill, which has a life span of 5.9 years. 
Despite the savings, there’s a problem. People don’t like the coins. Toward the end of last year, there were $1.4 billion  in dollar coins piled up in Federal Reserve vaults. 
Like Smith, other proponents of the $1 coin disagree with the GAO’s latest and much lower annual savings figures. 
A GAO report released in November said the $1 coin hadn’t really caught on with the public because the $1 bill was still in circulation. Also, savings were lower partly because new equipment to process the bills was allowing for a longer life span. (Early studies had listed the $1 bill’s life span at about 18 months). And the government was going to cut back on production of the coins and use the extra coins already in storage. 
""We think (the federal government) is gaming the numbers a bit,"" Shawn Smeallie, executive 
director of the Dollar Coin Alliance, says about the lower savings figures. The Federal Reserve improvements to increase the dollar bill’s life span haven’t been implemented yet, Smeallie says, and he thinks the costs for producing the coins is overstated. 
His group estimates the annual savings of the bill-to-coin switch would be about $366 million. The Dollar Coin Alliance -- a mix of vendors, mass transit agencies and trade associations that could benefit from the change -- is pushing for a Senate hearing this session for a bill on the change. 
Whatever happens, Smith is doing his best to circulate the coins in his hometown. But even there, where his crusade is well-known, he gets some pushback from people who don’t want the ""Charlie coins."" And when he travels to Atlanta and passes the coins off to cashiers, they usually ask whether he’s been riding MARTA. The public transit agency gives change in the $1 coins. 
So does Smith’s claim add up? 
The former state lawmaker said that circulating $1 coins instead of $1 bills could save the federal government $500 million a year. A newspaper featuring Smith’s story and statements misquoted the former state lawmaker and overstated his claim. 
One of the several federal studies, completed over a decade ago, about the bill-to-coin switch does include the $500 million savings estimate. Other studies since then have included lower savings claims. 
The overarching point of Smith’s statement was the potential savings of the $1 currency change. This is true. Moving to coins from paper money would save taxpayers’ money in the long run. 
But Smith cherry-picked the study with the largest amount of savings. He cited $500 million. The most recent study showed the saving at about $150 million, far less than Smith cited.

'Dhimmitude' on page 107 of the health care law exempts Muslims, claims chain email
","Have you ever heard of ""Dhimmitude""? A chain email claims ""dhimmitude"" is on page 107 of the health care law, and it means Muslims will be exempt from the health care law. We don’t want to keep you in suspense, so we’ll tell it to you straight: The word ""dhimmitude"" is not in the health care law. We know this because of our previous reporting on the law, and also because we did a full-text search on both the main law (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) and a companion law (the Health Care and Reconciliation Act). It’s not in either one. What is ""Dhimmitude""? Well, here’s what the email claims: Dhimmitude -- I had never heard the word until now. I typed it into Google and started reading. Pretty interesting. It's on page 107 of the health care bill. I looked this up on Google and yep, it exists. It is a REAL word. Dhimmitude is the Muslim system of controlling non-Muslim populations conquered through jihad (Holy War). Specifically, it is the TAXING of non-Muslims in exchange for tolerating their presence AND as a coercive means of converting conquered remnants to Islam. ObamaCare allows the establishment of Dhimmitude and Sharia Muslim diktat in the United States. Muslims are specifically exempted from the government mandate to purchase insurance, and also from the penalty tax for being uninsured. Islam considers insurance to be ‘gambling,’ ‘risk-taking,’ and ‘usury’ and is thus banned. Muslims are specifically granted exemption based on this. How convenient. So I, as a Christian, will have crippling IRS liens placed against all of my assets, including real estate, cattle, and even accounts receivable, and will face hard prison time because I refuse to buy insurance or pay the penalty tax. Meanwhile, Louis Farrakhan will have no such penalty and will have 100% of his health insurance needs paid for by the de facto government insurance. Non-Muslims will be paying a tax to subsidize Muslims. This is Dhimmitude. I recommend sending this on to your contacts. American citizens need to know about it. We turned to a reputable reference book, The Oxford Dictionary of Islam. It does not contain the word ""Dhimmitude,"" but it does include the word ""dhimmi."" The dictionary says that dhimmi is a historical term used to describe a ""non-Muslim under protection of Muslim law,"" which could include Jews, Christians or Hindus. Adult male dhimmis were required to pay taxes and follow regulations on dress, occupation and residence. In return, dhimmis received ""security of life and property, defense against enemies, communal self-government, and freedom of religion practice."" The dictionary notes that dhimmi status has lost relevance in the present day because of the rise of nation-states and modern legal codes. Some call ""‘dhimmitude"" the condition of non-Muslims being subject to Muslim rule, but the word seems to be a recent coinage of academics and commentators. We won’t dwell at length on the concept of dhimmis or of dhimmitude, since neither word is part of the health care law. The email goes on to claim that the health law specifically exempts Muslims. But that’s not the case either. The health care law has a general exception for religious conscience (see page 128). But it does not mention any particular religion, denomination or sect. During the debate over the law’s creation, the people most often mentioned as wanting an exemption were adherents of Christian Science, a faith that prefers prayer to conventional medical treatment. Our fellow fact-checkers over at Factcheck.org dug even deeper into the question of religious exemptions. They looked at religious groups that have filed for religious conscience objections over Social Security’s payroll taxes; the health care law defines the criteria for religious conscience exemptions in a similar way. Using a Freedom of Information Act request, Factcheck.org found in 2010 that no Muslim groups have requested religious conscience exemptions for payroll taxes. Moreover, Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations told Factcheck.org that he had never heard of Muslims having religious objections to health insurance. ""I have health insurance. We give health insurance to our employees. Every Muslim group I know of does the same thing,"" he said. Finally, we’ll note that the email claims Christians who don’t want insurance will face ""crippling IRS liens"" or ""face hard prison time."" This is also plain wrong. Members of Congress did not want the penalties for going without insurance to be too strict, so the law specifically states that people who fail to pay the penalty ""shall not not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty"" nor may government officials ""file notice of lien with respect to any property"" (page 131). In fact, this email is wrong on just about everything: The word ""dhimmitude"" is not in the law. Muslims are not specifically exempted. And if anyone is exempted, it’s a small number of Christian groups. For promoting absurd notions and wild fabrication, we have three words: Pants on Fire!  ",/factchecks/2013/may/30/chain-email/dhimmitude-page-107-health-care-law-exempts-muslim/

State Republicans say it took Charlie Crist only two weeks to break no-new tax pledge
","
The Republican Party of Florida is launching a pre-emptive strike against former golden boy Charlie Crist, who very well could run for governor in 2014 as a Democrat. In a new Web ad, the state GOP spoofs the History Channel with a segment called ""This Day in CRIST-ory."" 
The date: May 28, 2009. (The date should be May 27, but the state GOP flubbed that.) 
The setting: Tallahassee. 
The story: Then-Republican Gov. Crist is signing a $66.5 billion budget that includes a $1-a-pack cigarette tax and higher fees on drivers licenses and motor vehicle tags. The new taxes and fees, which are estimated to generate $2.2 billion, are needed to pass a balanced state budget -- and were supported by Republicans in the Legislature -- but also break Crist’s pledge not to raise taxes. 
""Two weeks after signing a taxpayer protection pledge, he (Crist) breaks it!"" the Republican Party’s ad exclaims. 
Here at PolitiFact Florida, we didn’t need a history lesson to remember the basics of the 2009 budget. But we did wonder about the state GOP’s assertion that Crist had the gall to break a pledge just two weeks after he signed it. 
Crist, it turns out, did sign a taxpayer protection pledge two weeks before signing the budget into law. We found that through a press release from … the Republican Party of Florida. 
At the time, Crist had recently announced he was running for the U.S. Senate, and Republicans far and wide were rallying around his candidacy. (Well, except former House Speaker Marco Rubio. That’s for another day in CRIST-ory.) 
But the pledge Crist signed on May 14, 2009, was for federal candidates, not state ones. And it was specific to income taxes. Not taxes in general. 
Crist signed a pledge from the Americans for Tax Reform, a well-known anti-tax group led by Grover Norquist. In it, Crist promised to ""oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses; and ... oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates."" 
A tax pledge yes, but one that wouldn’t be broken with a tax on cigarettes or motor vehicle fees. 
That doesn’t get Crist out of hot water, however. 
Crist signed another taxpayer pledge from Americans for Tax Reform in June 2005. In that pledge, Crist promised to ""oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes.""   
""Pledges are important, but actions speak louder,"" Crist said in an email to supporters in December 2005. ""Throughout my years of public service I have stood squarely against tax increases, and will continue to do so as governor."" 
Crist’s 2009 budget signature does appear to violate his older pledge -- particularly in allowing the $1-a-pack cigarette tax to become law. 
""The cigarette tax is appropriate, and I really view it more as a health issue than I do as a tax issue,"" Crist said May 19, 2009. ""(Ronald) Reagan said when you want to kill something you ought to tax it. Well, it wouldn't be bad if you killed smoking. There are about 2 million Floridians, maybe a few less, who smoke. And it's not good for you."" 
(We looked for that Reagan quote, the closest we could find was,"" Government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it."") 
Republican Party of Florida spokesman Matt Moon admitted the mistake in the ad's phrasing. ""While it's true we should have been more precise and not used the words 'two weeks,' ... he did sign a taxpayer protection pledge that he did break,"" Moon said. ""And we're still going to call him out on it."" 
Our ruling 
In a new Web ad, the state GOP portrayed Crist as a man who didn’t keep his word when it comes to raising taxes. The record there is pretty clear. Crist signed a pledge saying he would oppose efforts to increase taxes, yet signed a budget that included a $1-a-pack cigarette tax. 
However, the state Republican Party went unnecessarily far when it tried to say that it took Crist just two weeks to break that promise. 
The pledge he signed two weeks before approving the cigarette tax did not apply.

El Paso leader says El Paso ""safest"" city of its size in country
","Questioning characterizations of the U.S.-Mexico border as unsecured, El Paso’s county judge, Veronica Escobar, said: ""When elected representatives from our own state make claims that our border is not secure, they are ignoring the facts. When you look at El Paso, Texas, for example, we are the safest city of our size in the nation.""

Escobar, a Democrat, spoke during a May 22, 2013, telephone conference call with reporters organized to critique Republican U.S. Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas for voting against a Senate committee-advanced overhaul of immigration laws. The conference call was run by the Reform Immigration for Texas Alliance, which describes itself as a ""statewide network dedicated to building support for comprehensive immigration reform.""

Escobar’s reference to El Paso as the nation’s safest like-sized city reminded us of Democratic state Sen. José Rodríguez’s statement in September 2011 that El Paso had been named America’s ""Safest Large City"" a year after San Antonio, Houston and Dallas had the nation’s highest crime rates.

We rated that claim Mostly False; El Paso had low crime rates, but only a local press release had named it the nation’s ""safest"" large city--and its police department dropped the label. Also, the other mentioned cities did not have the nation’s highest overall crime rates; that was true only in comparison to a few huge cities.

Rodriguez had attributed El Paso’s ""safest"" status to an annual report by CQ Press listing crime statistics for cities with a population of more than 500,000. Similarly, Escobar relied on the 2013 CQ Press rankings for her statement, her county aide, Ruben Vogt, told us.

By email, Vogt pointed out a Feb. 5, 2013, press release from the city of El Paso stating that for the third straight year, El Paso had the lowest crime-rate ranking among U.S. cities with populations over 500,000, according to the 2013 CQ Press report. Vogt also listed several news articles, including an Austin American-Statesman Feb. 8, 2013, story, that played up the CQ Press crime-rate rankings.

Indeed, El Paso, home to more than 660,000 residents in 2011, topped CQ’s 2013 ""Lowest Crime Rate"" list for larger cities, which indicates that among 33 cities with 500,000 residents or more, El Paso had the lowest crime rate ""ranking"" based on FBI Uniform Crime Reporting data for 2011 as released in 2012. Trailing El Paso on the CQ Press list: San Diego, New York, Austin, San Jose, Calif., Los Angeles, Portland, Charlotte, Seattle and San Antonio. On the flip side, CQ Press said, Detroit had the highest crime rate ""ranking,"" followed by Baltimore, Memphis, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.; Houston placed 10th-worst by its ranking.

Neither El Paso’s press release nor the CQ Press summary identified the border city as the nation’s safest big city.

In CQ Press’s case, that’s on purpose, a spokeswoman told us by email. Before the report’s 2009 edition, Marina Ilishaev said, CQ Press used ""safest"" and ""dangerous"" to describe those cities with the lowest and highest rankings by its analyses.

""Even though the rankings are still provided,"" she wrote, ""these terms are no longer used because perceptions of safety and danger are just that—perceptions. The data analyzed here are reported crime and population, which together constitute only two factors considered when determining safety or risk of crime victimization.""

""...We would add, as we do in our methodology section, that we mean by ‘lowest composite reported crime rate’ the largest deviation below the national median in six main crime categories, which are counted equally,"" she said.

Specifically, CQ Press says its crime-rate rankings were derived from totaling each city’s violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault as tallied by the FBI plus the number of property crimes of burglary and motor vehicle theft, all in 2011. Then it follows a ""multistep process,"" CQ Press says, in which each city’s reported crimes in each category are compared to nationally reported crimes per 100,000 population rate and ""indexed to create a summary score and ranking across"" the six areas of reported violent and property crime.

Its overall approach--particularly weighting each type of crime the same--concerns criminologists such as Alfred Blumstein, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, who told us by telephone that the crime-rate rankings are ""highly suspect as true indicators of safety.""

By email, Mitchell Chamlin, a Texas State University criminal justice professor, said city-level crime rate comparisons are not particularly meaningful. ""Crime is local,"" Chamlin wrote, and ""most criminals work in a very small radius,"" typically smaller than a city.

Separately, the FBI has cautioned against using its statistics to develop rankings. In a 2011 online post, ""Pitfalls of Ranking,"" the agency said: ""Data users should not rank locales because there are many factors that cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place."" Its Unified Crime Report ""statistics include only jurisdictional population figures along with reported crime, clearance, or arrest data. Rankings ignore the uniqueness of each locale,"" the FBI said.

By telephone, Blumstein noted that anyone can estimate the relative safety in cities by calculating rates for each crime directly from the FBI’s statistics.

At his nudge, we looked directly at the FBI statistics for 2011 to compare rates of violent crime, which includes murder, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, though we limited our focus to El Paso and nine other cities of 500,000 or more population listed in the 2013 CQ Press report as having the ""lowest crime rate"" rankings.

Results from our sampling:

--El Paso had the fourth-lowest violent crime rate in 2011, at 431 violent crimes per 100,000 residents. Austin (430), San Diego (388) and San Jose (335) had lower rates.

--El Paso had the lowest murder rate, 2.4 per 100,000 residents, followed by San Diego (2.9); Seattle (3.2); Portland (3.4); and Austin (3.5).

--El Paso had the second-lowest burglary rate of the cities, 281 per 100,000 residents, with New York (221) faring best. San Jose ranked third (441), followed by San Diego (444). Austin ranked seventh (873).

We shared our calculations with Sgt. Chris Mears, a spokesman for the El Paso Police Department, who speculated by telephone that a reason El Paso might have a higher burglary rate than New York is that more local residents possess cars and trucks. ""How many people in New York drive their own vehicles around?""

Also, Mears said, El Paso’s violent crime rate includes domestic violence incidents, which he said account for about half of the city’s violent crime, an indication there is not much other violence.

Broadly, Mears said by email, if the crime-rate results ""say statistically El Paso had less victims of crime than other large cities, one could argue for the time period in question El Paso was the safest large city.""

Our ruling

Escobar said El Paso is the ""safest city of our size in the nation.""

This conclusion draws on the latest CQ Press crime-rate rankings, which suggest El Paso has the lowest crime-rate ranking of 33 cities with 500,000 residents or more, a conclusion drawing on 2011 crime statistics gathered by the FBI. But ""safest"" is not that simple. The FBI advises against using its figures to rank cities. Also, CQ Press stopped attaching the ""safest"" label to its crime-rate rankings years ago, saying the label conveys a perception rather than a fact. It gave us pause, too, that in 2011, El Paso had higher violent-crime and burglary rates, according to FBI-collected figures, than at least one other large city.
