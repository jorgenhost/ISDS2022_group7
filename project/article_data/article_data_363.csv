Republican Governors Association TV ad says Democrat Maggie Hassan likes taxes, just not for herself
","It has become the most recognizable building in the race for governor -- the colonial residence in Exeter, N.H. of Democratic candidate Maggie Hassan. Hassan’s abode was a topic whispered about by the campaign of her rival Ovide Lamontagne for months but it wasn’t until the Republican Governors Association released an ad three weeks before the Nov. 6 election that it became water-cooler conversation.   ""This is Maggie Hassan's half-million dollar home, a half-million dollar home that Hassan pays no property taxes on, zero property taxes,"" the narrator in the ad titled ""Zero"" declares. The ad goes on to charge that when Hassan was the majority leader of the state Senate ""she pushed 33 tax and fee increases for the rest of us on top of our property taxes."" ""Maggie Hassan believes in higher taxes, just not for herself,"" the ad concludes. PolitFact New Hampshire decided to examine the accuracy of this claim that in the closing weeks of this tight race has sparked plenty of controversy, including several requests by PolitiFact readers to check the ad. The ad is part of the RGA's $5.8 million television advertising buy since the Sept. 11 primary, all spent on attacks against Hassan to benefit Republican Lamontagne. Since the day the ad was released Hassan said it was misleading because it fails to mention that she and her husband, Tom, don't own the home. They live in it because he's the principal of Phillips Exeter Academy, one of the country's most exclusive prep schools in the country. Hassan's camp maintains the ad tries to give the impression that she is a property tax scofflaw when in fact she's not. Five days after the RGA ad came out, the Hassan campaign came back with its own ad titled ""Action,"" which opens with the same image of the home and explains the school ownership. Undeterred, the RGA through its Live Free PAC put up a second commercial titled ""Hiding"" with Hassan's home on it, and went back to the well. ""Maggie Hassan admits she pays zero property taxes on her half-million dollar home,"" it declares. ""Maggie Hassan pays no property taxes, but she likes high taxes for us."" RGA Communications Director Michael Schrimpf said his group's researchers went through property assessment records in Exeter and found out the Hassans paid no property taxes. Phillips Exeter officials confirmed that Tom Hassan's contract requires that he live on campus in this home and that it be open and available for many school functions. The home is valued at $545,900 by the town and is one of the school’s tax-exempt properties. If someone was paying taxes on it, the bill would be about $12,350 a year. Private school property is tax-exempt on buildings used for instruction or administration. The Hassan residence qualifies under administration because the principal lives there. School officials listed the property on its tax-exempt application and the town approved. Phillips Exeter Director of Communications Julie Quinn said the private school is still the largest property taxpayer in town paying $772,946 a year on parcels that are not tax-exempt such as dining halls and dormitories. On top of claiming Hassan pays no property taxes, the RGA ad also declares Hassan likes taxing everybody else. As PolitiFact noted in a previous checkon a Lamontagne claim that Hassan was a big spender during her time in office from 2004-2010, total state spending went up by 20 percent during that period. But looking at funds spent from state taxes and fees, spending actually went down, since the Democrats twice reopened the budget to make cuts. It’s also true that when the 2010-11 state budget was out of balance, Gov. John Lynch and the Legislature, including Hassan, approved two bills that included revenue-raising taxes and fees that totaled more than $260 million. Our ruling: While it's true the Hassans pay no property taxes, it’s for good reason. She does not own the home she lives in. It’s owned by Phillips Exeter Academy where her husband Tom is principal and he is required to live in the home. The building is one of the school’s tax exempt properties, but Phillips Exeter is still the town’s largest taxpayer. The ad by the Republican Governor’s Association gives the impression that she's evading her own taxes while supporting increased taxes ""for the rest of us."" The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim to be Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DD46C0>],/factchecks/2012/oct/29/republican-governors-association/republican-governors-association-tv-ad-says-democr/

Mitt Romney says women White House employees earn less than men under Barack Obama
","
As part of his campaign to court women voters, President Barack Obama has repeatedly noted that one of his first acts in office was his signing of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which makes it easier for workers who claim pay discrimination to sue for relief.

But Mitt Romney’s campaign is using a clever counter-attack -- charging that Obama’s own White House pays female employees less than male employees.

""Under President Barack Obama, women are lagging behind,"" says a mailer distributed to homes in northern Virginia, a key battleground in a leading swing state. ""Barack Obama promised us change. … Women today under President Obama are earning less. Single women are earning less than married people and single men. Even women in Barack Obama’s White House are earning less than men. … Barack Obama hasn’t earned a second term.""

Many readers have asked us to check this claim, so we will.

For months, conservative bloggers and news outlets have been touting the statistic that women working for the White House earn 18 percent less than men do. The statistic stems from calculations published in April 2012 by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative online publication.

""According to the 2011 annual report on White House staff, female employees earned a median annual salary of $60,000, which was about 18 percent less than the median salary for male employees ($71,000),"" the Beacon wrote. Put another way, that means women in the White House earned 85 percent of what the men earned. The statistic got a second round of attention as the discussion of women’s pay disparities increased during the Democratic convention (where Ledbetter spoke) and in the debates.

When we downloaded the same statistics from the White House website and ran the numbers, we came up with similar results -- $63,240 for women and $72,876 for men. So women in the White House, by our calculations, earn 87 percent of what their male colleagues at the White House do, not far off from what the Free Beacon found. (Some of the variation may be explained by differences in determining the sex of the 454 employees on the list. We were able to determine the sex of all but 18 employees.)

The gender pay gap we found provides support for the Romney mailer’s claim that ""even women in Barack Obama's White House are earning less than men.""

However, we think it’s worth pointing out a couple caveats.

Women at the White House fare better than women in the economy at large

We’ve previously rated Mostly True the claim that women ""receive only 77 cents for every dollar a man earns."" By that standard, women working for the White House suffer from a smaller gap than do women who work elsewhere.

The 77-cents and 87-cents figures don’t reflect apples-to-apples comparisons

This is an issue that has tripped up Obama in the past: When Obama claimed earlier this year that ""women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men,"" we rated it Mostly False, since the 77-cent statistic does not factor in what occupations are held, how many hours are worked or how long someone has been in the job.

When women do the same job as men, the pay gap narrows quite a bit. And in fact, this is exactly what happens when you look deeper into the White House data. Even when you just control for one factor -- people who have the same job title -- the gap narrows significantly.

We found 36 titles for full employees held by more than one person, including at least one man and woman. Of these 36 job categories, there was no difference in pay between men and women in 22 job categories, affecting 121 employees. In another six categories affecting 29 employees, the highest earner in the category was a woman who out-earned at least one man.

In only eight cases affecting 22 employees -- in other words, a small fraction of all employees -- was the highest earner a man who out-earned at least one woman. In a large majority of job categories, there was no salary edge for men. And even in the cases where men did have an edge, it was a small edge -- the lowest-paid women mostly earned between 92 percent and 98 percent of what the top-paid men did.

And don’t forget that we’re only adjusting the data using one factor -- job title. There are other factors that could explain different salaries for people who hold the same job title, such as prior work experience, specific skill sets and the number of years they have spent in the job. 
The White House pointed PolitiFact to several conclusions in an analysis of the 2011 salary data by the Washington Times, which has a reputation as a conservative-leaning newspaper.

""President Obama’s top female White House aides earn more on average than their male counterparts, a reversal from the pattern in the George W. Bush administration,"" the newspaper wrote. ""Top female employees on average earned nearly 4 percent more than top male employees under Mr. Obama, compared with a deficit of 12 percent under Mr. Bush.""

However, the analysis also said that the further you go down in seniority, the more ""mixed"" Obama’s record becomes. The median salaries calculated by the Washington Times mirrored those in the Free Beacon’s analysis, which in turn were close to what PolitiFact found.

Our ruling

In the broadest sense, the Romney campaign is on solid ground when it says that ""women in Barack Obama's White House are earning less than men."" But the closer you look at the data, the less striking this conclusion becomes.

First, the Obama White House has more equitable pay rates than the economy as a whole. And second, when you look at employees who have the same titles, only a small fraction of women are out-earned by men, a difference that might be explainable by differences in experience and longevity rather than discrimination. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971D7E00>],/factchecks/2012/oct/29/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-women-white-house-employees-earn-/
"['New Jersey', 'Jobs', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie says Democrats are to blame for private-sector job losses from 2000-2009 by increasing taxes, regulations and state spending
","
Just in time for Halloween, Gov. Chris Christie cautioned New Hampshire voters last week to avoid the ""horror movie"" that New Jerseyans have lived through.

Here’s how the Republican governor summed up that film’s plot: Democrats increased taxes, fees, regulations and state spending, leading the Garden State to lose private-sector jobs between 2000 and 2009.

""See, look at what happened to us. From 2000 to 2009, we had a jobless decade: more private-sector jobs in New Jersey on Jan. 1, 2000 than were there on Dec. 31, 2009,"" Christie said Wednesday at a campaign event for Ovide Lamontagne, the Republican candidate for governor of the Granite State.

""A jobless decade under Democratic leadership, because what did they do?"" the governor went on. ""Raise taxes, increase regulation, raised fees, and during that period of time, spending went up an average of 16 percent a year.""

The governor’s right about the drop in private-sector jobs, but he’s wrong to attribute that reduction only to tax and fee hikes, regulatory changes and state spending increases. Christie failed to note the impact of the recession, which coincided with the deepest losses of private-sector jobs. 
Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts told us ""the Governor’s comments are factual and the record of job loss AND economic malaise in the decade dominated by Democratic leaders, who raises taxes, fees and burdensome regulation, speaks for itself.""

First, let’s break down the job figures.

According to seasonally adjusted figures from the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the state had 3,366,100 private-sector jobs in December 1999 and 3,211,100 in December 2009.

That represents a net loss of 155,000 private-sector jobs over the decade. During the same time period, New Jersey gained 69,300 net jobs in the public-sector.

But the bulk of the private-sector job losses occurred in 2008 and 2009 -- the height of the recession. The recession technically lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.

After five consecutive years of private-sector job gains, New Jersey lost 107,900 jobs in 2008 and 117,000 in 2009.

Harry Holzer, a professor at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute and the chief economist for the U.S. Department of Labor under President Bill Clinton, called Christie’s comparison ""extremely unfair.""

""It's an extremely unfair comparison, since Jan. 1 2000 was the peak of the late-90s boom and Dec. 31 2009 was close to the trough of a terrible recession,"" Holzer said in an e-mail.

""There is no question that the recession contributed, and is likely the dominant effect,"" Holzer added. ""When you go from the strongest labor market in the past 40 years to the weakest one in 80 years, there will be a lot of job loss, and that was true in every state in the country.""

But Joseph Seneca, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, told us another factor was how New Jersey’s private-sector job gains preceding the recession lagged behind the nation’s growth rate.

""The reasons for that weak performance compared are complex, but they include the loss of competitiveness of the state in terms of attracting, retaining and growing private sector investment and employment,"" Seneca said in an e-mail.

""How much of this loss in competitiveness was due to taxes, regulations, other business costs, and a perceived unfriendly business climate cannot be easily determined, but by the mid years of the decade this deterioration in competitiveness had manifested itself in weak job growth.""

Our ruling

At a campaign event in New Hampshire last week, Christie claimed New Jersey lost private-sector jobs between 2000 and 2009 because Democrats increased taxes, fees, regulations and state spending.

The governor’s right about the drop in private-sector jobs: New Jersey lost 155,000 jobs between December 1999 and December 2009. But the reasons behind those job losses are complex and Christie failed to acknowledge the impact of the recession, which coincided with the bulk of the job losses.

"['Ohio', 'Congress', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Voting Record', 'Josh Mandel']","
Josh Mandel ad claims Sherrod Brown “voted six times to raise his own pay""
","As he campaigns to unseat Sen. Sherrod Brown, Josh Mandel, Ohio's Republican treasurer, has worked to paint the Democratic incumbent as a free-spending Washington insider.

A recent TV ad for Mandel follows that line by saying that Brown ""voted six times to raise his own pay.""

PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out that claim, expecting it would be a straightforward, but instead found it illustrates the daunting complexity of the legislative process.

First, some background.

Article 1, Section 6 of the Constitution requires Congress to determine its own pay. It can use specific legislation to raise the pay.

But there is a limitation on that created by the 27th Amendment of the Constitution, which was ratified in 1992. It says: ""No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have intervened.""

In other words, members of Congress can change the pay of the next Congress, but not their own.

Seems simple enough. But, as the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reports -- the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 created an automatic annual cost of living adjustment.

The automatic pay raise was created in exchange for members not getting paid for private speeches. The pay raise, based on a formula, is automatically included in appropriations bills, with raises for other federal employees. So the law -- even if it had the best of intentions -- created a system in which pay for members of Congress can increase without members having to cast a straight up or down vote on the raise.

Because the pay raises are essentially automatic, the only thing Congress can do is vote to stop them. There are roll call votes on whether members of Congress were willing to hear amendments to suspend their pay increases. And it is those procedural votes that the Mandel ad relies on for support.

Now, some specifics.

The first of the votes cited by the Mandel campaign in support of its claim was one Brown cast July 17, 1996 -- when he was a member of the House of Representatives -- on the Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill for fiscal 1997.

Brown voted ""no"" on the $23.1 billion bill, which included a pay-freeze provision to deny the automatic pay increase.

""Therefore,"" Mandel's campaign told us, ""he voted in favor of a pay increase.""

But wait.

Brown's campaign, responding to the Mandel ad, said that Brown ""has voted against pay increases at least seven times."" The first instance it cited was Brown's vote in favor of the provision denying the pay increase on July 16, 1996 -- the day before the vote on the appropriations bill.

Did Brown's ""no"" vote on the appropriations bill the next day cancel that out?

Not exactly. According to the Congressional Research Service, the House-passed version of the appropriations bill (H.R. 3756) was sent to conference with the Senate and was incorporated into H.R. 3610, the Omnibus Continuing Appropriations Act for fiscal 1997.

The omnibus spending act included the provision denying the automatic pay raise -- and Brown voted in favor of the act when it was passed in final action by the House on Sept. 28, 1996.

So using the reasoning applied in the TV ad, Brown actually voted against giving Congress a pay increase.

Here’s the other examples the Mandel camp cited in support of the ad claim:

1997: On Sept. 24, 1997, Brown joined the majority as the House voted to ""order the previous question"" on a motion to instruct conferees (participants in the budget conference committee with the Senate) on an issue unrelated to a pay freeze. Because the House permits only one motion to instruct conferees, the Congressional Research Service said, ""this vote in effect foreclosed the possibility of instructing conferees to omit the pay adjustment from the conference report."" As a result, the Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill did not include a pay freeze.

1998: On Oct. 7, 1998, Brown voted in the minority against the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act for fiscal 1999, which included a provision blocking the pay raise. On Oct. 20, however, he voted with the majority in favor of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill, which had the provision stopping the pay raise.

2000: On July 20, 2000, Brown voted with the House majority on ""ordering the previous question"" on a rule to consider the fiscal 2001 Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations bill. The vote had the effect of not allowing a pay-freeze amendment, and ""was seen by some as a vote to accept a pay adjustment,"" the Congressional Research Service said.

2002: On July 18, 2002, Brown voted with the House majority to order the previous question on House Resolution 488, which prevented consideration of an amendment to stop the cost-of-living raise, and allowed consideration of H.R. 5120, the fiscal 2003 Treasury Appropriations bill. The vote ""was seen by some as a vote to accept a pay adjustment,"" the CRS said.

2012: The final example cited by the Mandel campaign was Brown's vote in the Senate last March against one of the many amendments proposed to the Senate highway transportation bill. The amendment would have extended the current 2-year pay freeze on the federal workforce of about 2 million, including members of Congress, to help pay for a wide range of tax deductions and credits. But the amendment also included more-controversial items. It would have opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, approved construction of the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline and mandated a huge expansion of offshore oil-and-gas leasing.

What's the take-home on the ad's claim?

The Constitution doesn't permit members of Congress to raise their own pay. The raises cannot take effect until after an election selects a new Congress.

Congress, though, essentially built a system, before Brown arrived, that allows for pay raises without direct votes by members. That can make it difficult to say who voted for or against raises, which were a tiny part of much larger appropriation bills.

Mandel's ad exaggerates when it cites six votes to say that Brown voted six times to raise his own pay. The votes cited by the Mandel camp were procedural in nature that didn’t raise the pay on their own. In two of the six cases cited, later votes on those same spending bills could be seen as Brown votes against pay raises.

And in the most recent case cited, it is misleading to characterize Brown's no vote as a vote to raise the pay for Congress given the other issues that were involved. The vote came on an amendment that contained wide-ranging and unrelated provisions that had been hot points for debate.

As PolitiFact Ohio has noted previously, legislators frequently face the dilemma of having to vote against something they might normally support because it is included in wide-ranging legislation that also has other provisions they cannot support.

In the case of these cited procedural votes, all involved broad pieces of legislation. None were focused purely on the pay raise issue.

The Mandel ad claimed that Brown voted six times to raise his own pay. On the Truth-O-Meter, that claim rates False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978A47C0>],/factchecks/2012/oct/29/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-ad-claims-sherrod-brown-voted-six-time/
"['Education', 'Health Care', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Donna Howard']","
Donna Howard says ""so-called"" balanced state budget has $12 billion in holes
","
Can a balanced budget also have gaping holes?

So suggested state Rep. Donna Howard, who told an East Austin meetup organized by Texans for Obama in August 2012: ""We’re talking right now about a $12 billion hole in our current, so-called balanced (state) budget.""

The Austin Democrat’s chief of staff, Scott Daigle, later told us that the declared hole lies in lawmakers last year not covering the full projected 2012-13 costs of Medicaid and public schools while also diverting billions of dollars from special dedicated funds to balance the books.

Specifically, he said, the 2012-13 budget does not cover some $5 billion in projected Medicaid costs, defers a regular school payment of about $2 billion and diverts about $5 billion that was supposed to be dedicated to particular programs to balance the $173.5 billion budget.

About $4.9 billion was diverted from dedicated accounts to balance the budget, according to a September 2011 report by the comptroller’s office, though it’s not a novel tactic. We previously rated as Mostly True a November 2010 claim by state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, that the 2009 Legislature had diverted $3.5 billion in dedicated funds to make the 2010-11 budget look balanced.

Howard’s other figures hold up, we learned, though there were twists after the budget passed into law.

The cost of a postponed distribution of school aid, put off to the fiscal year beginning Sept. 1, 2013, has been ratcheted down from an initial $2.3 billion estimate to $1.9 billion due to changes in enrollment growth, according to information from the advisory Legislative Budget Board.

And while the budget’s Medicaid under-funded amount was initially pegged at $4.3 billion, Eva DeLuna Castro, senior budget analyst for the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, told us that pending agency budget requests reveal that the Texas demand on Medicaid, the jointly federal-state-funded insurance program serving low-income families, will be higher in 2013 than originally estimated. She said increased caseloads and costs drive up the under-funding to $5 billion.

Rolling up these adjusted figures gets us to $11.8 billion, close to Howard’s $12 billion.

DeLuna Castro and other close observers of state spending -- John Kennedy of the business-oriented Texas Taxpayers and Research Association and Chuck DeVore of the right-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation — did not quibble with Howard’s building blocks.

Then again, Kennedy suggested that only the cited Medicaid amount must be covered before services are sought. That’s because Medicaid is an entitlement program; states must serve qualified applicants.

If lawmakers wanted to do so, DeLuna Castro separately countered, they could fail to cover all the funding gaps, though she said that would have negative effects. For instance, she speculated, lawmakers could dramatically cut nursing home reimbursements rates by 30 percent, which she said would prompt nearly every benefiting nursing home to shut down, touching off client lawsuits.

""Politically, there is a need for health care and schools,"" DeLuna Castro said.

We were curious if schools or Medicaid already have been hindered by the budget decisions singled out by Howard. Not so, relevant agencies said.

Stephanie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, told us by phone that Medicaid recipients haven’t been affected by the Medicaid IOU because the state’s matching money has yet to run out. She speculated the 2013 Legislature would cover the funding gap in time to maintain the state’s Medicaid commitments.

Education agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe said by email that school districts have not been battered by the deferred state payment partly because officials have been cognizant of the payment delay since mid-2011. ""We have long advised districts to have sufficient (local) fund balances to manage through times when cash is tight. We would certainly hope that districts can manage a two-week delay without causing significant financial distress,"" Ratcliffe said.

DeVore of the public policy foundation posited another wrinkle. Along with any shortfalls in the budget, he said, it’s relevant to consider what many expect to be a projected revenue surplus when lawmakers write the next budget. That is, holes can be filled -- and soon.

The state treasury has accumulated revenue thanks to larger-than-expected receipts from sales, oil and gas production taxes.

State Comptroller Susan Combs said in September 2012 that through the previous month, the state had reaped $3.7 billion more in tax revenue than earlier projected, on top of a previous unexpected surge of $1.6 billion, according to a Sept. 12, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article. Dale Craymer, president of the business-backed Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, then commented he would not be surprised if lawmakers convening to write the next budget in 2013 are told the state faces a record revenue surplus. The established high-water mark is the $8.8 billion surplus reported at the end of 2007, Craymer said.

On top of the better-than-expected revenues forecast, there is the rainy day fund -- the state savings account that can be used to close budget gaps. The comptroller estimated in fiscal year 2011 that the rainy day fund contained $8.2 billion and would contain $9.4 billion in fiscal year 2013.

Our ruling

Donna Howard says the current ""so-called balanced"" state budget has a $12 billion hole.

Lawmakers did not cover all projected state costs of Medicaid in 2013 and put off a regular payment to school districts. As before, too, portions of funds intended for special purposes were set aside to balance the budget. On the other hand, school districts have not been slammed by the deferral and the agency overseeing Medicaid doesn’t expect consequences to eligible Texans unless lawmakers unexpectedly fail to cover costs during the 2013 legislative session.

Besides, billions in unallocated projected revenue could help the next Legislature meet funding needs.

Howard’s ""hole"" traces to funding shortfalls in the latest budget. But that budget still was balanced. We rate this claim as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F77B80>],/factchecks/2012/oct/29/donna-howard/donna-howard-says-so-called-balanced-state-budget-/
"['New Jersey', 'Education', 'Tom  Kean Jr. ']","
Tom Kean claims only New Jersey decreased higher education aid over last decade
","
Republican state Sen. Tom Kean Jr. provided a stark but erroneous statistic comparing New Jersey’s investment in higher education to the rest of the nation.

While touring William Paterson University to rally support for a bond referendum on the Nov. 6 ballot, Kean said in the last decade New Jersey was the only state in the country that took money away from higher education. If voters approve the referendum, New Jersey may borrow $750 million to fund construction projects at all of the state’s colleges and universities.

""New Jersey is the only state in the union that spent less on higher education than it did at the beginning of the decade,"" Kean, the Senate minority leader, said to reporters on Oct. 17.  ""That's unfathomable that over the course of the last decade the state aid to higher education went down.""

Here, we’ll address Kean’s point that only New Jersey decreased aid over the last decade.

On that point, Kean is wrong.

The legislator’s spokesman, Adam Bauer, said Kean meant to refer to state appropriations for higher education in the two-year window between fiscal years 2006 and 2008. 

Over those years, New Jersey was the only state to decrease its aid for higher education, according to a Rutgers University analysis of data from the Grapevine report produced by Center for the Study of Education Policy at Illinois State University.

New Jersey’s state tax funds for operating expenses of higher education fell by 0.3 percent in that time frame.

As of fiscal year 2010, the Grapevine report has been produced in cooperation with the State Higher Education Executive Officers.

According to the State Higher Education Executive Officers data on state and local support available for public higher education operating expenses, New Jersey’s appropriations have increased during the last decade.

By that measure, New Jersey’s appropriations increased by 37 percent from 2000 to 2010.  Other measures of state support for higher education also show increases of more than 30 percent over the last decade.

But what about inflation? Depending on what index you use to adjust for inflation -- the State Higher Education Executive Officers uses an index specifically intended to take into account the increases in costs for colleges and universities -- the amount of the percentage increase in educational appropriations varies, but it is still an increase.

The amount of per-student spending is another worthwhile way to compare higher education spending between states, according to experts.

The State Higher Education Executive Officers calculates the educational appropriations for each equivalent of a full-time student in constant dollars. 

New Jersey spent $11,194 by that measure in 2000. By 2010, that amount had dropped to $7,300. 

But even by that measure, New Jersey’s far from alone. More than 40 states decreased educational appropriations per student over the decade.

Our ruling

""New Jersey is the only state in the union that spent less on higher education than it did at the beginning of the decade,"" said Kean.

That’s not true. 

Kean’s spokesman said he intended to refer to the two-year period between fiscal years 2006 and 2008, but over the last decade, the raw numbers show appropriations for higher education in New Jersey have increased. 

Spending levels per student have decreased over the last decade. But data shows New Jersey is one of dozens of states to cut funding by that measure.

We rate this statement False.

The Cohen campaign has challenged the veracity of many claims by Flinn, a radiologist who has built his wealth by owning radio stations and spent millions on various campaigns since 2002. Cohen’s campaign says the mailer contains numbers that are both out of context and inaccurate. So we asked the Flinn campaign for evidence.

On statements like this, where statistics are used in an attempt to assign someone credit or blame, it is PolitiFact policy to a) determine the accuracy of the numbers and b) the extent to which the designation of credit or blame is accurate.

Flinn spokeswoman Kristi Stanley defended the mailer and said the numbers came straight from federal statistics as reported by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics.

But when we double-checked, we found that the Cohen campaign was closer to the truth -- Flinn’s campaign either misread the statistics or cherry-picked other numbers from the years 2007 (when Cohen took office) and 2012 (the current election year).

Cohen officially took office as the 9th Congressional District representative in January of 2007, following his election in November of 2006 to succeed five-term Congressman Harold Ford Jr.  The originally reported unemployment rate for Shelby County for January of 2007 was 5.5 percent. When it was later revised, the new numberwas 5.7 percent. Either way, a significant distance from the 4.8 percent listed on the mailer.

What about the unemployment rate now? The 9.7 percent figure used by the Flinn campaign appears to be pegged to reports for July, but the unemployment rate by August dropped to 9.0 percent in Shelby County.

Those numbers for August did not become available until Sept. 27, so it’s possible the mailer was prepared with only the July numbers available. In any case, the most recent figures reported on Oct. 25 show the unemployment rate for Shelby County had dropped to 8.4 percent, following national trends.

As to whether Cohen deserves blame for the unemployment rate’s worsening in Shelby County since arriving in D.C. in January of 2007, we reached out to some economists and consulted similar PolitiFact rulings involving other elected officials.

Malcolm Getz, an associate professor of economics at Vanderbilt University, put it this way in an email: ""One member of Congress has 1/435 of the vote in the House of Representatives. Whatever passes the House must also pass the Senate. The system is designed to allow many voices to be heard and counted with no single voice having determinative effect.""

And: ""Macroeconomic phenomena like the unemployment rate is strongly influenced by events outside of government control.""

Economics professor John Gnuschke, head of the University of Memphis’s Sparks Bureau of Business and Economic Research, had a similar reaction: ""A single Congressman doesn't have the ability to change the direction of the economy or the recovery.""

Gnuschke wrote further that ""economic conditions in Memphis mirrored those in the rest of the nation and were in no way unique. . . . Improvements locally have been slow because the nation's recovery from the Great Recession has been slow. Congressman Cohen was not the cause of the decline and is not the problem with the slow recovery. Look to a weak private sector and their unwillingness to hire and invest as the issue of the day.""  

Google makes it possible to create charts that show the unemployment rate over time, and you can compare different geographies. When you match up the unemployment rates for the United States, Tennessee, Shelby County and Memphis, you get four lines that rise and fall consistently at about the same rate.

The Cohen campaign strongly believes Cohen does not deserve blame for the numbers, and points to examples that it says represent actions that improved the economic situation in Memphis and Shelby County.

Cohen campaign manager John Marek wrote in an email: ""Congressman Cohen brought us Tennessee’s first Minority Business Center, which will give racial minorities and women more access to business loans, which means jobs. Congressman Cohen also saved 500 jobs when he ensured that the American Steamship Company came to Memphis, and he created many jobs in Memphis when he brought us the $15 million Tiger grant, which will be a big development project downtown. He supported President Obama's jobs bill, which was blocked by Republicans in Congress.""

Marek also made this point -- Flinn was a Shelby County Commissioner from 2004 to 2010: ""Arguably a County Mayor and County legislature would have more to do with the unemployment numbers than a Federal Congressman.""

Flinn’s campaign stands by the mailer and says Cohen has not delivered.

Our ruling

In a campaign mailer, Republican congressional candidate George Flinn blamed Steve Cohen for the unemployment rate in Shelby County being more than twice as bad now (4.8 percent to 9.7 percent) than it was in 2007 when he took office.

But Flinn’s numbers are off, no matter if you stop the clock at the July numbers or the more recent September numbers. Further, the campaign overreaches by trying to pin responsibility for Shelby County’s economic collapse and then gradual recovery on one elected official. We rule this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F15300>],/factchecks/2012/oct/28/george-flinn/george-flinn-blames-steve-cohen-shleby-unemploymen/

Mitt Romney says Rhode Island demonstrated that it can run Medicaid more cost-effectively than the federal government
","
Is Rhode Island’s $2 billion-a-year Medicaid program for the poor a model for the rest of the United States?

That was the impression Mitt Romney gave during the third presidential debate Oct. 22, when he talked about how he would balance the federal budget within 8 to 10 years.

One thing he would do, he said, is change the way Medicaid is run. ""We'll take that health-care program for the poor and we give it to the states to run because states run these programs more efficiently. As a governor, I thought please, give me this program. I can run this more efficiently than the federal government, and states, by the way, are proving it. States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these -- these Medicaid dollars; have shown they can run these programs more cost-effectively"" than the federal government.

Did the federal government get a more efficient Medicaid program in Rhode Island by giving it to the state to run?

The idea is certainly in line with Romney's philosophy for health-care coverage. He objects to a nationally administered program such as Obamacare but favors comparable programs if they are run individually by the states, such as the program he adopted in Massachusetts. And Romney has also advocated a block grant system in which Medicaid would be turned over to states to run as they see fit.

So let's start with some background.

Medicaid is a health-care program for the poor, financed by federal and state money. In Rhode Island, the federal government reimburses 52 cents of every dollar spent.

The money is distributed by states under rules set by the federal government. States have limited latitude on how the money is spent and require a ""waiver"" if they want to bend or break the rules.

On Jan. 16, 2009, in the final days of the Bush administration, the federal government granted a sweeping ""global waiver"" to Rhode Island at the request of Republican Gov. Donald Carcieri. It allowed Rhode Island to, for example, move people out of nursing homes into less-expensive community-based care. It also gave the state more power to make unilateral changes to the Medicaid program. In return, the state agreed to foot the bill if costs increased above a pre-determined ceiling over the next five years.

But here's the important point for the purpose of this fact check: the waiver didn't, by any measure, completely turn the administration of Medicaid over to Rhode Island. There are still lots of federal strings attached.

So contrary to the impression debate viewers might have gotten from Romney's comment, Rhode Island is not a case study in what happens if you make Medicaid a block grant program and turn control over to a state.

It does, however, illustrate what can happen when a state gets more flexibility and officials are committed to improving medical care for the poor.

So did the 2009 ""global waiver"" produce a more-efficient program?

Several factors complicate the issue.

First, the deal gave Rhode Island federal money for things the state was previously paying for by itself, such as early intervention for at-risk children. It saved money for the state, but not the federal government.

Second, some of the efficiencies that occurred were initiated before the waiver was granted; in other cases, the waiver wasn't needed to implement them. For example, a large drop in expensive nursing-home use came the year before the waiver took effect.

In other words, other states could achieve those efficiencies under the existing federal program.

Because of that, the degree of efficiency, as measured by how much money was saved, is also a complicated -- and debated -- question.

Gary Alexander, who was secretary of health and human services when the waiver was approved, published a paper with the conservative Galen Institute, pegging the savings at $110 million over 18 months, or $73 million a year.

The Romney campaign cites the Alexander paper as evidence that Rhode Island saved money.

The liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities issued a report saying Alexander was wrong because any savings actually resulted from more than $400 million Rhode Island received in federal stimulus money in 2009 and the shifting of some costs previously paid by the state to the federal government.

Rhode Island’s current Health and Human Services secretary, Steven Costantino, asked The Lewin Group, a consulting firm, to do a less-partisan analysis after Carcieri left. According to that group's estimates, the waiver itself saved $23 million over three years, or $7.6 million annually, Costantino said.

In addition, the deal also provided a $42.7-million windfall for the state over the same three years because the federal government started sharing the costs of some health services, he said.

Total savings per year: just under $22 million.

To put this in perspective, a savings of $73 million a year (the high number cited by Alexander) is less than 4 percent of the state’s annual $2 billion Medicaid budget; $22 million would be 1.1 percent.

(Costantino told us another $32 million was saved over three years thanks to the improvements to the program that the state made without the waiver.)

Our ruling

Mitt Romney said Rhode Island took its federal Medicaid money and demonstrated that the state could run the program more cost-effectively than the federal government.

In context, his statement suggests that the federal government turned over control of the program to Rhode Island. That's not the case.

Instead, the state got a waiver from federal rules through a program designed to let states experiment with better ways to provide health care for the poor. That allowed Rhode Island to continue to realign and streamline the program, saving millions.

Even without the waiver, there's evidence that the state would have saved money because it was already inaugurating reforms on its own.

The degree of savings is debatable, but Romney never cited an amount.

Because his statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

Are the Multnomah County Library's hours the shortest in the area?
","
Supporters of a new Multnomah County Library District say a new tax structure is necessary for keeping one of the nation’s busiest libraries ""working for all of us."" In a mailer, the Libraries Yes! Committee paints an already dim picture of the system.

The mailer notes reduced hours and compares them to other metro-area counties: ""Right now, our libraries are open 44 hours per week, down from 57 hours just a few years ago. That’s the lowest of any library in the four-county region.""

PolitiFact Oregon was well aware that the system has cut back in certain areas, but it surprised us that the cuts had gone so far as to put operating hours behind Clackamas, Washington and Clark counties. We thought a quick check was warranted -- and quick it was.

We checked the website for each of the counties’ libraries and calculated the weekly operating hours for the main branches. Here’s what we found.

In Multnomah County, the Central Library is open 44 hours each week.

In Washington County, the Hillsboro Main Library is open 64 hours each weekand the Beaverton City Library is open 63 hours.

In Clackamas County, the library system is open 52 hours a week.

And up in Washington’s Clark County, the main Vancouver Community Library is open 60 hours a week.

We  also called the group responsible for the mailer and asked them about the statement. They sent us a slightly different group of numbers -- the average number of hours a library was open in each county. Their findings supported the same conclusion: Multnomah County library hours are the lowest in the four-county region.

Will a Multnomah County Library tax district cost the typical homeowner $4 a month?
","
When it comes to voting for or against increased taxes, it’s helpful to know exactly what the bottom line is. Just how much will this mean out of my pocket?

Supporters of a new Multnomah County Library District -- the Libraries Yes! Committee -- tried to put the tax measure in some context in a recent mailer. ""The typical homeowner will pay $4 more per month than the amount we currently pay.""

We thought it was worth a quick check to see just what the measure’s impact would be for the average homeowner.

We spoke with Liz Kaufman, who is handling media for the campaign, to see how it arrived at the $4 mark.

She directed us to the measure’s explanatory statement written by Multnomah County Attorney Jenny Morf. In the statement, Morf wrote that ""If approved, the Multnomah County Library District will be formed with a permanent rate up to $1.24 per $1000 of assessed value. The typical homeowner will pay $49 a year above the cost of the current levy or $.89 per $1000 assessed value.""

So that extra 35 cents per $1,000 of assessed value would mean an extra $49 a year. Divide that by 12 and you get $4.08. The math checks out.

Next we examined what constitutes a ""typical"" homeowner. According to Multnomah County, the median assessed home value for the county is $149,920. Homeowners at that level are paying just over $11 a month, or $133 a year, at the current 89-cent rate. That would get bumped up by about $4 to $15.50 -- or $185 annually -- if the tax district passes.

We ran the numbers again, just to be safe, with the average assessed value, which is higher, about $178,000. At that number, homeowners currently pay $13.20 a month and can expect to pay $18.40 a month if the measure passes -- $5.20 more.

By the way, homeowners won’t see the full increase immediately. For the first five years, they would actually be charged $1.18 for each $1,000 of assessed value. After that, it starts to climb to the maximum $1.24.

While the ultimate cost would be more for the average house, we think it’s fair to call the median number, where half the houses are assessed at more and half less, ""typical."" Those figures back up the Libraries Yes! Committee’s claim that the typical homeowner will pay $4 more per month"" once the new district goes into full effect.

We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968BFA40>],/factchecks/2012/oct/26/libraries-yes-committee/will-multnomah-county-library-tax-district-cost-ty/

Romney says Obama plans $4,000 tax hike on middle class
","
With jobs and other pocketbook issues the top concerns for most voters, the Mitt Romney campaign has been running ads that warn about rising taxes for the middle class if Barack Obama is re-elected.

In a television ad called ""Putting jobs first"", a video clip shows Mitt Romney speaking during the Denver debate. Romney says ""I’m not going to raise taxes on anyone."" As he says that, these words appear on the screen: ""Under President Obama: $4,000 tax hike on middle class families.""

The ad doesn’t say when this tax hike will take place or point to any plan from Obama to raise taxes on the middle class. In this fact-check, we’ll explore the roots of this claim and whether it’s what the middle class can reasonably expect from a second Obama term.

The ad references a study from the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. The study focuses on the national debt, and in particular, on the payments needed to cover the interest on that debt. What the authors, Matt Jensen and Aspen Gorry, try to do is figure out how those payments might be spread across different income groups.

The $4,000 figure comes from the results for households making between $100,000 and $200,000 a year. The study found that interest payments on the new debt added in Obama’s first term equal $1,600 for this group. It then takes the president’s 2013 budget plan and projects it out to 2022. It calculates that the added payments during this period would total $2,400. Add the two and you get the number in the ad, about $4,000.

There’s only one problem with saying the study describes a tax hike: It doesn’t. It describes a cost that must be paid, but that is entirely separate from the question of how it is paid, by whom and when. We’ll get into some of the details in just a bit.

A quick way to see the gap between the study and reality is to look at the $1,600 figure for Obama’s first term. By the logic of the Romney campaign, these households already would have seen an increase in their tax bills by that amount. In reality, those families enjoyed a variety of tax breaks during that period, from lower payroll taxes to tax credits for college tuition.

The ad also puts responsibility for the whole $1,600 amount on Obama. As PolitiFact has shown, even with full accounting for the cost of the stimulus, the rising debt stems in part from policies that predate Obama, such as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the economic recession that began before he took office.

Let us note, none of this is a criticism of the study. One of the authorities on economic modeling is economist Alan Auerbach at the University of California Berkeley. The study’s lead author, Matt Jensen, cites Auerbach. We asked Auerbach what he thought of the study.

""I don’t see any obvious flaws in the way the calculations are done,"" Auerbach said. But he also called the work ""hypothetical"".

The Romney campaign took an analytic exercise and presented it as concrete reality.

This shift shows up in the different words used by the American Enterprise Institute and the campaign. The headline on the institute’s web site is ""Obama’s big budget deficits could mean a $4,000 a year middle-class tax hike.""  The operative word is ""could"". The Romney campaign web site is less restrained. It says the cost of the debt under Obama ""would require an additional $2,500 in taxes.""

More reasons to be cautious with the study

One of the study’s assumptions is that tax revenues will cover future deficits. That drew a criticism from Jason Peuquet, research director with the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that favors strong efforts to reduce deficits.  Peuquet calls the study a useful exercise but says its approach is too narrow.

""It only looks at the tax side of the equation,"" Peuquet said. ""In reality higher debt could mean much lower spending on certain programs. Including spending in the equation could produce very different distributional outcomes from these illustrative scenarios.""

William Gale, a Brookings Institution economist who worked in the first Bush White House, expands on that point. Obama ""might cut spending, he might raise taxes differently than the study's assumptions, he might let the debt ride,"" Gale said. In short, the study is not a prediction of the future.

Our colleagues at Factcheck.org have noted that deficits would continue to rise under the House Republican budget plan championed by Romney’s running mate, Paul Ryan. In their fact-check, they fault the Romney campaign for glossing over that Republicans too would add to the portion of taxes that would need to go to service the debt. The increase under the GOP plan would be much less than under Obama but it would still be an increase.

Our ruling

The Romney campaign ad says Obama’s policies are a $4,000 tax hike on the middle class. But their evidence is a study from the American Enterprise Institute that looks at public debt. 
The campaign makes a giant leap when it assumes the debt will be serviced with increased taxes on all income levels and in the time frame it suggests. We actually don’t know how the tax code will spread around the pain of paying for the debt; right now, Obama is proposing tax increases only on higher income households. 
Finally, we should point out that debt payments would rise even if Romney wins the presidency. If you accept the ad's logic, then you'd have to accept that Romney too plans tax increases for the middle class. 
The campaign distorts the meaning of the study to score political points. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3FE200>],/factchecks/2012/oct/26/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-plans-4000-tax-hike-middle-class/

Tammy Baldwin says Senate rival Tommy Thompson ran Medicare ""into the ground"" as U.S. health and human services secretary
","
In the second debate between U.S. Senate candidates Tammy Baldwin and Tommy Thompson, the Democratic congresswoman lit into the Republican former governor on Medicare. 
Baldwin rebuked Thompson on his performance as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, a post he took after leaving the governor’s office. 
""When Tommy Thompson left Wisconsin in 2001 to join the Bush administration, he ran Medicare. You could say he ran it into the ground,"" Baldwin charged in the Oct. 18, 2012, debate. 
""When he came to the administration, Medicare was approaching bankruptcy in the year 2029; when he left, it was 2020 -- nine years closer to bankruptcy. That's the Tommy Thompson record as secretary under George W. Bush."" 
That’s pretty tough stuff, especially the thrust of Baldwin’s accusation, that Thompson was personally responsible for pushing Medicare closer to bankruptcy. 
Medicare and its solvency 
Medicare, the government health insurance program that serves some 49 million senior citizens and people under 65 with certain disabilities, cost $549 billion in 2011. It is funded by two separate trust funds. 
The trust fund for Medicare Part A -- which covers inpatient hospital care, home health care, and services at skilled nursing facilities and hospices -- is funded mostly from federal payroll taxes. This is the trust fund typically cited when politicians from both parties warn of Medicare’s demise. 
Each year, the Medicare Board of Trustees projects the number of years before the Part A trust fund will be exhausted.
Since 1999, when Baldwin first entered Congress, the annual reports have put the life of the trust fund at between eight and 28 years. The most recent projection, in March 2012, said the fund would be exhausted in 12 years, in 2024. 
Baldwin’s evidence 
Asked for evidence to back the claim, Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus cited the Medicare board’s annual reports for 2001 and 2005 -- the years that correspond with Thompson’s tenure as Health and Human Services secretary. 
In 2001, the trust fund for Part A was projected to be solvent through 2029; but by 2005, it was projected to be exhausted in 2020, nine years sooner. Kraus argued that Thompson did nothing to prevent the nine-year slide. 
So, Baldwin was right on the numbers. 
But her claim put the blame squarely at Thompson’s feet, suggesting he could have prevented the slide himself. 
Thompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe noted it is Congress’ job to properly fund Medicare, saying Thompson only administered the program ""as directed by law."" 
Just what was his role? 
Other evidence 
PolitiFact National’s examination of a March 2012 claim by Mitt Romney, the GOP presidential nominee, is helpful in evaluating Baldwin’s claim against Thompson. 
Romney’s statement was different -- he claimed President Barack Obama was ""ending Medicare as we know it,"" partly by ""allowing it to go bankrupt in less than 15 years."" 
On the bankruptcy point, PolitiFact National pointed out that decisions made over nearly 50 years by many presidents and members of Congress put the program on an unsustainable path. 
Our colleagues also said ""it’s not clear that Medicare’s situation fits the two definitions of ‘bankrupt’ we’ve used in the past -- to be ‘declared in law unable to pay outstanding debts’ or ‘reduced to a state of financial ruin: impoverished.’ Medicare is a government program; the government will have the ability to pay its bills, however financially painful that may become."" 
On that point, PolitiFact National concluded: ""We find it a ridiculous exaggeration to say Obama is personally responsible for Medicare’s woes."" 
It would be even more ridiculous to lay full blame for Medicare’s move toward ""bankruptcy"" on a cabinet secretary. 
Expert views 
Two Medicare experts we interviewed agreed that the performance of the HHS secretary is a factor in the solvency of Medicare’s key trust fund, but far from the determining one. 
""It certainly is reasonable to say the secretary is the ultimate point person for Medicare in the administration,"" said Jack Hoadley, health policy analyst and research professor at Georgetown University. But he also said many factors, such as congressional actions and longstanding trends in demographics and health care spending, ""matter in determining the life"" of the fund. 
Joseph Antos, health care and retirement policy scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said an HHS secretary only implements Medicare law handed down by Congress. He said it’s ""more correct to say Congress and the fee-for-service payment mechanism ran Medicare into the ground. The big spending is on payments for health services, and Congress sets payment rates through legislation. Fee-for-service gives a strong incentive for the use of more services, and more complex services, which increases total program spending."" 
Our rating 
Baldwin said Thompson ran Medicare ""into the ground"" during his four years as health and human services secretary, citing the fact that its key trust fund moved nine years closer to insolvency. 
But Medicare’s financial health is determined more by presidents, members of Congress, health care costs and other factors -- over a period of decades -- than by the limited role of the HHS secretary.

Thompson says most Democrats, but not Baldwin, voted for his billion-dollar property tax cuts
","
In the second U.S. Senate debate, Republican Tommy Thompson went after Democrat Tammy Baldwin as an extreme liberal with a voting record to the left of most in her own party.

The former governor said the pattern reached back to Baldwin’s years representing Madison in the state Assembly from 1993 to 1999.

""When I was governor I cut income taxes three times. I cut property taxes by over a billion dollars, not once, but twice,"" Thompson said. ""And you know, my opponent was in the Assembly at the time. Most of the Democrats voted with me. Congressman Baldwin voted against it.  Property taxes is a huge tax on the middle class. She voted against it.""

Let’s go to the tape.

Did most Democrats, but not Baldwin, vote for big property tax cuts?

Although Thompson mentioned two big property-tax relief bills, he appeared to narrow it to one vote when talking about Baldwin.

When we asked Thompson’s campaign for backup, they pointed us to a vote on the 1995-’97 budget.

That two-year budget provided $1.2 billion in local property tax relief without a general state tax increase. The mechanism: A big boost in state aid to local school districts, reducing the property tax burden.

The Journal Sentinel July 1995 headline on the bill signing: ""Thompson exults over tax relief.""

Elected officials and tax experts debate whether the relief was fairly distributed and ultimately amounted to $1.2 billion, but say it’s reasonable to describe it that way.

So give Thompson a point.

The main thrust of his charge, though, was that Baldwin was an outlier.

Here’s what the legislative history shows:

In 1995, at the time of that vote, Republicans controlled both the Assembly and Senate. Baldwin voted no when the budget bill containing the property tax relief passed the Assembly on June 22, 1995.

The vote: 52-47, with only one Democrat, Rep. Annette (Polly) Williams, joining with Republicans to approve it. In the state Senate, it was the same story: only one Democrat, Sen. Lynn Adelman, joined in the majority.

So Thompson’s main point -- that Baldwin bucked a bipartisan tide voting for the plan -- is off the mark.

Finally, it’s worth noting the budget bill contained hundreds of spending decisions as well as major policy items -- not just the property tax plan.

The year before, there was a stand-alone vote on a Democratic bill that went even further than Thompson’s later plan. It sought to completely eliminate local property tax funding of schools. Thompson’s 1995 plan greatly boosted state aid to schools but still left one-third of the costs to local districts.

Baldwin voted in favor of the 1994 bill, which passed 81-18 but did not get through the Senate amid GOP accusations it was an election-year stunt. All but one Assembly Democrat voted for it. Many Republicans voted yes, with an election looming. Thompson warned that state tax hikes might be necessary to pay for the Democratic plan.

Finally, a footnote. We did not find a second instance of a billion-dollar property tax cut under Thompson. There was a tax-cut package close to that in 1999 that was a mix of income tax cuts and property tax relief. It was approved with significant support by Democrats. Baldwin was in Congress by then.

Our rating

Thompson claimed Baldwin, while in the Assembly, voted against a property tax relief plan that most other Democrats favored.

There’s an element of truth in that Baldwin voted no on the budget that prominently included a property tax relief plan. But most Democrats actually opposed the budget, a critical fact that undercuts the impression Thompson meant to leave -- that Baldwin had bucked her own party.

As the Associated Press reported, the Biden clip is from an April town hall on COVID-19 with 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Biden didn’t fall asleep there, either. The doctored video pulled from a point in the interview when Biden was looking down. He later looked up. A social media user told the Associated Press he created the altered video. A Facebook post claims Biden was asleep and snoring during a TV interview. That didn’t happen. The video was edited to create a deceiving and inaccurate narrative.

No, the CDC did not ‘quietly adjust’ US coronavirus deaths
","Over the weekend, President Donald Trump shared two posts that falsely claimed COVID-19 deaths are not as high as previously thought.  The posts claimed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its COVID-19 death numbers to show that only 9,210 Americans have died from the virus. Twitter removed the first tweet for violating its rules. Another post from Jenna Ellis, a senior legal adviser for the Trump campaign, linked to a story from the Gateway Pundit, a conservative news site. That tweet was still up as of publication. The tweets misconstrue federal data on COVID-19 victims. As of Aug. 31, the CDC reported that 182,622 Americans have died since the start of the pandemic — and some estimates put the death toll even higher. The agency told us that the vast majority of deaths involving COVID-19 can be attributed to the virus.  Claims that the CDC adjusted its COVID-19 death numbers appear to have originated on Facebook before making their way to Trump’s Twitter feed, according to VineSight, an organization that uses artificial intelligence to surface potential misinformation. Several posts have been shared thousands of times. (Screenshot from Facebook) ""CDC just backpedaled (quietly) and adjusted the US Covid deaths from 153,504 to 9,210,"" said Amiri King, a social media influencer and CBD salesman, in an Aug. 31 post that shows a screenshot of King’s tweet, which was also deleted. ""Admitting that their numbers were so f---ed that they were off by a whopping 94%."" The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The social media posts trace back to an Aug. 26 update from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is part of the CDC. The report is updated every Wednesday and outlines provisional death counts for COVID-19. In his post, King cited an older version of a data table about deaths from COVID-19 in combination with other conditions, such as pneumonia and influenza. In a section titled ""Comorbidities,"" the NCHS wrote: ""For 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death."" That data comes from death certificates. King cited an older version of the NCHS report that analyzed 153,504 deaths involving COVID-19. Six percent of that figure is 9,210.  To some readers, the report may appear to confirm his math. But it doesn’t. In medicine, comorbidities are conditions that patients experience in tandem with a primary condition. According to the CDC, people with preexisting conditions like cancer and diabetes are more at risk of death if they contract the coronavirus. The NCHS report shows that the vast majority of coronavirus-related deaths occur in patients with comorbidities. But that doesn’t mean COVID-19 wasn’t a factor. ""A small number of people have COVID ascribed as the sole cause of death. It may be they had no comorbidities or they were just not noted,"" said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""However, it is also clear that advanced age and several other underlying diseases lead to bad outcomes with COVID infections. The people dying were not going to die but for the acquisition of COVID.""  In a Facebook post addressing claims about the NCHS report, Dr. Mark Halstead, an associate professor of orthopedic surgery and pediatrics at Washington University, broke down how conditions are listed on a patient’s death certificate. RELATED: Don’t trust this comparison of daily coronavirus deaths with other diseases ""So, let's say someone was admitted to the hospital because of symptoms of COVID. They test positive, so COVID would be listed,"" Halstead said in the post. ""Their case progressed where they developed respiratory failure and now are on a ventilator. Respiratory failure can be listed."" Additional conditions may be listed on a patient’s death certificate during the course of their stay in the hospital. For example, if a COVID-19 patient ended up dying from cardiac arrest, that could also be included. ""So now three things are listed on their death certificate,"" Halstead wrote. ""The COVID infection started the process but that led to the heart and lungs failing, which killed that person."" Jeff Lancashire, acting associate director for communications at the NCHS, told us in an email that while 94% of death certificates that mention COVID-19 also listed other conditions, the underlying cause of death was COVID-19 in almost all of them. ""The underlying cause of death is the condition that began the chain of events that ultimately led to the person’s death,"" he said. ""In 92% of all deaths that mention COVID-19, COVID-19 is listed as the underlying cause of death."" We reached out to King for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. A Facebook post claimed that the CDC decreased the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. from 153,504 to 9,210. That’s wrong. As of Aug. 31, the CDC counted 182,622 Americans who had died because of the coronavirus. A NCHS report found that, for about 6% of Americans who die from the virus, COVID-19 is the only condition listed on their death certificates. But that doesn’t mean the remaining 94% didn’t die due to the coronavirus. People with preexisting conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, have a higher risk of dying if they contract COVID-19. Complications from those conditions, as well as comorbidities like influenza and pneumonia, can be listed in addition to the coronavirus on death certificates. In 92% of death certificates that mention the virus, COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death, according to the NCHS. The Facebook post is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

Michigan officials decry ‘racist’ robocall with false attacks on mail-in voting
","A robocall targeting Detroiters falsely claims that voters who apply for and use absentee ballots are providing personal information that will be used against them. ""If you vote by mail, your personal information will be part of a public database that will be used by police departments to track down old warrants and be used by credit card companies to collect outstanding debt. The CDC is even pushing to use records for mail-in voting to track people for mandatory vaccines,"" the robocall says. None of these claims are true. The top elections and legal officials in Michigan jointly denounced the robocall, labeling it a racist and inaccurate attempt to dissuade the use of mail-in voting. ""This is an unconscionable, indefensible, blatant attempt to lie to citizens about their right to vote,"" Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in a news release. ""The call preys on voters’ fear and mistrust of the criminal justice system — at a moment of historic reckoning and confrontation of systemic racism and the generational trauma that results — and twists it into a fabricated threat in order to discourage people from voting."" ""This is an unfortunate but perfect example of just how low people will go to undermine this election,"" Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in the news release. After Nessel’s office received one complaint last week, the state set up a website for those to report receiving the call and has received approximately 20 reports so far. Authorities learned of the roughly 37-second call after someone who received it alerted radio station WWJ-AM (950). It's the only complaint received so far on this call, according to Nessel's office. The speaker on the robocall identifies herself as working for a civil rights organization founded by Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl, two right-wing provocateurs who are routinely accused of peddling misinformation. However, Nessel said the state is still working to confirm who recorded and orchestrated the distribution of the robocall. ""This robocall is fraught with scare tactics designed to intimidate Black voters — and we are already working hard to find the bad actors behind this effort,"" said Nessel. Michigan’s voter registration application asks individuals to provide some basic personal information. Applicants must share their driver’s license or Michigan-issued state ID card number, the last four digits of their Social Security number or an alternate form of identification unless they are hand-delivering their application to their clerk’s office, disabled or eligible to vote overseas. This is required by federal law. Applicants must also share their first and last name, date of birth and address. In Michigan, any registered voter can request an absentee ballot, which requires completing a form noting basic information voters would have already shared when they registered to vote. But the robocall falsely suggests otherwise, warning Detroiters that voting absentee means ""giving your private information to the man."" The call also falsely claims that when voters submit an absentee ballot, their personal information will become part of a public database. Voter registration records are available to the public and show a voter’s name, address and birth year. All other information, including the identification number used by the voter, month and day of birth, and phone number or email address if the voter included it are not publicly available. These details can only be accessed by the Michigan Secretary of State’s office as well as local election officials and workers. This is not information police departments, credit card companies or the Centers for Disease Control can access. It's a felony under Michigan law to deter or otherwise disrupt a person trying to vote, according to Nessel's office. Someone convicted of this offense could face a $1,000 fine and up to five years in prison. More than 1.6 million people successfully cast absentee ballots in the state's Aug. 4 primary election. In Michigan, mail-in voting and absentee voting are the same thing, and the method is a secure way to participate in the electoral process, Benson and other elections experts say. But President Donald Trump and other Republicans continue to repeat false claims about mail-in voting, arguing the process may lead to a rigged or corrupt election. Experts say vote-by-mail does not give an advantage to either political party and election fraud in any form is incredibly rare. This fall, more than 3 million Michigan voters — about 38% of registered voters in the state — are expected to mail in their ballots as the presidency is up for grabs and the pandemic rages on.  Our ruling  The robocall claims the personal information of those who vote by mail will be included in a public database that will be used by police departments to track down old warrants, credit card companies to collect debt and the CDC to administer mandatory vaccines. There is absolutely no truth to the claims. While the robocall says that the personal information of those who vote by mail will be exposed, there is no information mail-in voting makes public that isn’t already included in public voting records. Voting by mail does not require voters to share personal information beyond basic identifying information already required when voters registered with the state, and this information is used only for the purposes of administering elections.

No, photo does not show Kyle Rittenhouse’s mother on the night protesters were shot
","Nearly a week after 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse arrived in Kenosha from Antioch, Illinois, and — according to criminal charges — shot and killed two people during a night of protests and chaos in the city, a photo is circulating on social media purporting to describe how he got there.  Rittenhouse was recorded on video that night carrying a rifle and saying it was his job to protect life and property. It was the third night of unrest after a Kenosha police officer shot Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, seven times in the back at close range. Rittenhouse has been charged with homicide and remains in Illinois awaiting further legal proceedings. On Aug. 28, 2020, Facebook user Doug McLean shared a photo and connected it to the night of the deadly shooting. It has since drawn more than 800 shares and, in its various iterations, scores of comments.  In the picture, a white woman is shown wearing fatigues with a long gun strapped to her chest. ""How did Kyle Rittenhouse cross state lines to Wisconsin? His mom, pictured below drove him. #KyleRittenhouse’s mom Wendy, photographed on same night her son killed two people and shot another,"" McLean wrote.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A release from Rittenhouse’s attorneys on Aug. 28, 2020 disputes this. That release says Rittenhouse had stayed in Kenosha for the night after finishing work as a community lifeguard. But there’s a bigger problem with the photo that was shared: It’s not even from the same day. Or the same city. Let’s dig in.  The woman with the long gun actually appears in a photo in a separate city, on a different day. The image was cropped in the Facebook post in question to focus on her. Facebook user Miki Pope shared the original photo, in which the woman stands with a group of other similarly armed people outside the Wisconsin state Capitol in Madison, where protests also occurred after Blake was shot by police.  ""Last night (Aug 24) in Madison, these counter-protesters showed up with long guns,"" Pope wrote in the early morning hours of Aug. 26, 2020.  Pope’s post references the violence Rittenhouse is charged with in Kenosha, but does not in any way tie him to the people in the photo aside from decrying the actions of such militia members that have been showing up at various protests.  ""I'm afraid this won't be the last shooting, as armed white supremacists are becoming more and more public about their hatred for Black lives and the Black Lives Matter protests,"" Pope wrote.  It’s unknown whether Rittenhouse’s mother had any involvement in bringing her son to Kenosha that day — but the photo does not depict anyone who was there.  And, as noted, Rittenhouse’s attorney says the teen was in Kenosha already and stayed there into the night hours. A Facebook user claimed that a photo of a white woman with a gun was the mother of Kyle Rittenhouse.  But the photo is not from that protest. It’s cropped from a larger image of a handful of people with guns standing outside the state capitol in Madison two days earlier.

Examining claim about Austin homicides, crimes
","In an effort to dissuade local governments in Texas from cutting police funding, state leaders have pledged to pursue legislation next year that would freeze property tax revenue for any city or county that cuts its law enforcement budget. The move came as the Austin City Council approved its $4.2 billion budget for the upcoming fiscal year, which included plans for $21.5 million in immediate cuts to the city’s police budget and plans to shift to other city departments another $128 million in spending on civilian functions currently overseen by police. During an Aug. 18 press conference announcing the property tax proposal, Gov. Greg Abbott warned that now, more than ever, is a dangerous time for the city to cut its police budget. ""A new study showed that Austin, Texas, is the No. 1 city in America in the year-to-year percentage increase in murders, with a percentage increase of more than 64% for the first half of this year,"" Abbott said. ""Austin also has a year-to-year increase in the percent rate of aggravated robberies, increasing by 14%, and robberies increasing by 16%. When crime is on the rise, the last thing that we should do is to defund law enforcement."" Abbott’s comments on the percentage increase in homicides caught the most attention and drew pushback from some city leaders who said the statistic lacks important context. Namely, that the number of homicides in Austin is much lower than in other cities, which means any change will result in a large percent increase compared with earlier years. Abbott’s figures came from a Wall Street Journal article examining homicides in major cities during the coronavirus pandemic. The report found ""a sharp rise in homicides"" in 36 of the 50 biggest cities in the country, including in Austin. His statement reflected the numbers included in the report for Austin, but they lack important context about crime and homicides in the city. ""Assessing, even generally, the safety of a city just using crime statistics, they don’t tell you a lot of the story,"" said Carsten Andresen, an assistant professor of criminal justice at St. Edward's University. ""They don’t capture who goes in and out of a city, which parts of a city are safe."" Wall Street Journal data The Wall Street Journal analysis looked at data from police departments in each of the 15 largest cities in the country and compared the number of homicides recorded for the first six months of 2020 with the number of homicides recorded over the same period last year. The information was shared in a graph that accompanied the article. The analysis found that, of those cities, Austin recorded the largest percentage change in total homicides, with a 64.3% increase from the first half of 2019. By the end of June, the city had recorded 23 homicides, up from 14 at the same time last year. For comparison, six months into 2018 there were 18 homicides, in 2017 there were 13 and in 2016 there were 12. Chicago reportedly had the second largest percentage change in total murders, with an increase of 52.5%. By the end of June, the city had 433 homicides. Of those 15 cities, Austin had the second lowest count of homicides during the first six months of the year. Context behind Austin’s numbers The numbers included in the Wall Street Journal article are reflected in the June 2020 edition of Austin Police Chief Brian Manley’s monthly reports, which are published online. But the numbers alone don’t tell the whole story. Lt. Jeff Greenwalt, who heads the Austin Police Department’s Homicide and Aggravated Assault unit, said ""the percentage you see is a little more alarming than the actual numbers."" ""I think there is an underlying story to the snappy headline,"" Greenwalt said. ""While there is an increase, it is only a handful more because we have low numbers in the first place. The real statistic is going to be at the end of the year, where we compare to years past."" Even then, Andresen said using percentage change in this instance won’t accurately represent the situation at hand. ""First of all, homicide is such a small number,"" he said. ""You’re going to have huge percentage changes. I’ve always been told: don’t use percentages for numbers that are under 50. If you’re looking at 30 or 45, don’t use a percentage difference because the percentage changes are so big."" Homicides in particular are tricky to analyze over an extended period of time, as they tend to be isolated incidents and some months may see more than others. In order to speak to changes in the number of murders within a city, using six months of data is not enough, according to Michelle Richter, an associate professor of criminology at St. Edward’s University. ""You should be looking at at least five years’ worth of data,"" she said, noting that this kind of analysis should also account for changes in population size. ""I would not be alarmed by (that percentage), and this is the reason why: Austin has, for the most part in terms of long-term trends and patterns, one of the lowest violent crime rates,"" she said. ""You have to look at bigger data."" From 2014 to 2018 (complete 2019 data has not been produced), the number of murders in Austin fluctuated: ∙2018: 32 murders, or 3.3 murders per 100,000 residents ∙2017: 25 murders, or 2.6 murders per 100,000 residents ∙2016: 39 murders, or 4.1 per 100,000 residents ∙2015: 23 murders, or 2.5 per 100,000 residents ∙2014: 32 murders, or 3.5 per 100,000 residents Andresen said an analysis of month-to-month or year-to-year changes, should be focused on ""missed opportunities to be able to reduce those homicides in the future."" Greenwalt said his unit is working to investigate any identifiable trends or ""anything unusual going on"" in murders this year, but so far they have the same underlying causes the department experiences in other years. ""Most of the time, our homicides involve drugs and robberies,"" he said. ""Every once in a while we see family violence or an acquaintance."" He also noted that the department has nearly a ""100% solve rate"" on homicides this year. ""What he’s saying in and of itself is accurate, however there is just a lot more to the story,"" Greenwalt said of Abbott’s remark. Our ruling Abbott said crime is on the rise in Austin, which is ""the No. 1 city in America in the year-to-year percentage increase in murders, with a percentage increase of more than 64% for the first half of this year."" Abbott’s figures are from a Wall Street Journal analysis of homicides in cities across the country, and they are reflected in reports from the Austin Police Department. But the issue is the conclusion he is drawing from these figures. Experts said crime data of this scale (changes in small numbers over a short time period) does not accurately reflect a crime trend or the safety of a specific area. They also said focusing on the percentage change in discussions of shifts in smaller values can overstate increases or decreases over time. Abbott’s statement is accurate, but leaves out important details and needs more context.

Fact-checking John James on Gary Peters’ committee attendance
","In the race for one of the few vulnerable Senate seats held by a Democrat this year, Republican John James is targeting Michigan Sen. Gary Peters as an ineffective, ""invisible"" incumbent. A recent campaign ad, distilled this argument, which James has echoed elsewhere.  ""They call him the invisible man, the politician known for doing nothing, Gary Peters. Nothing to prepare us for covid. His responsibility. Nothing for our economy. Peters doesn’t show up for work. Skipped 84% of small business hearings. Nothing to protect workers. Skipped 89% of hearings on China. But Peters has done one thing: Got rich in public office. Doubled his wealth. Gary Peters: Invisible for Michigan"" Poor committee attendance is a time-worn argument by challengers, one we have seen many times before. Here, we’ll look at James’ assertion that Peters is ""known for doing nothing"" and that he ""skipped 84% of small business hearings (and) skipped 89% of hearings on China."" Peters served three terms in the House, then was elected to the Senate in 2014. He is seeking a second term this year, against James, a West Point graduate and Army combat veteran. James ran for the Senate in 2018 but lost to Democratic incumbent Debbie Stabenow. James’ campaign staff said the numbers refer to Peters’ service on the House Small Business Committee and the Congressional Executive Commission on China, which he joined as a senator in 2015. Committee attendance statistics are not easily accessible; determining them requires scrutinizing transcripts of dozens of committee hearings, some of them made public months after the hearing, to see whether a lawmaker participated. The James campaign said they found that Peters missed 43 of the 51 Small Business Committee hearings in 2011 and 2012, when he was serving in the House and before he was elected to the Senate. As for the China commission, the James campaign said it used the same method and found that Peters missed 16 of 18 meetings since Peters joined the committee. (Here are all the hearings with links, courtesy of the James campaign.) When we contacted Peters’ campaign, they didn’t dispute the James campaign’s numbers. But they said the figures amount to cherry-picked metrics of Peters’ level of engagement in Washington. For starters, they said the Small Business Committee attendance rate references activities nearly a decade ago. During his three terms in the House, Peters was also a member of the House Financial Services Committee, a more powerful panel. ""A lot of committees will schedule hearings at the same time, making it virtually impossible to attend, in a meaningful sense, all of them,"" said Joshua Huder, a Georgetown University political scientist. Roll Call, a Washington publication that covers Congress, wrote in 2014 that unless the senator wields the gavel, he or she may only show up for five minutes, or when it is their turn to ask questions. The focus on committee attendance also overlooks that Peters co-sponsored the Small Business Jobs Act, which eased access to credit by small businesses and was signed into law by President Barack Obama. Currently, in the Senate, Peters serves on the Armed Services Committee, the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, and the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee.  Each of those committees is considered influential, yet it’s notable that the ad focuses on the China panel, which is not a traditional congressional committee and does not generate or approve legislation.  The panel was created in 2000 to monitor China's compliance with international human rights standards, to encourage the development of the rule of law in China, and to maintain a list of victims of human rights abuses in China. It is charged with submitting an annual report to the president. Fox News reported that ""many of the members of the commission ... had spotty attendance at the commission's hearings."" Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, said the China panel is ""a different kind of creature."" ""It exists to monitor activity in China, which is largely done by staff,"" Smith said. He added that the Trump administration has not filled the five seats that are reserved for presidential appointees.  There’s also another metric to gauge how active Peters has been in the Senate: The percentage of floor votes missed. In 2019, the most recent full year available, Peters missed exactly zero floor votes, which put him in a 16-way tie for the best vote attendance in the chamber. Peters’ 100% voting rate was equal to that of the chambers’ two leaders, Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Chuck Schumber, D-N.Y. That record ""indicates that Sen. Peters was on the job,"" Smith said. Finally, Peters has received high marks for effectiveness from the Center for Effective Lawmaking, an independent institution run by Vanderbilt University and the University of Virginia. During the 2017-18 congressional year, the center ranked Peters as the fourth-most effective Democrat out of 48 in the chamber. The measurement is based on the bills lawmakers sponsor, how far those bills move through the legislative process, and how significant their policy proposals are. Intra-party comparisons are the most reliable, since there’s a major difference in clout between a majority senator and a minority senator. ""Despite his minority-party status, he was very active in navigating a number of legislative items through the Republican-controlled Senate,"" Alan Wiseman, the center’s co-director, told the Michigan Advance. ""His success in advancing his legislative agenda in the 115th Congress is greater than one would expect, given his relatively low seniority in the Senate."" Meanwhile, the Lugar Center and Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy rated Peters third among Democratic senators, and 12th overall, in bipartisanship in 2019. James said that Peters is ""known for doing nothing. … (Peters) skipped 84% of small business hearings (and) skipped 89% of hearings on China."" The percentages are accurate, but they are cherry-picked because they ignore multiple other measurements that indicate a high level of engagement by Peters in Washington, including recent influential committee assignments, a perfect record on floor votes, and high scores on effectiveness from independent academic analyses.

""While we are on the cusp of a Great American Comeback, Mark Kelly & Joe Biden want to raise taxes on hardworking Arizonans and defund the police."" We’ve previously fact-checked exaggerations about Biden’s tax plan, which would raise taxes on wealthier Americans and corporations.

No. Kelly, the son of two police officers, has said he does not want to defund police departments. He has said, however, that changes in policing are needed.

RELATED: Fact-checking Arizona Senate race claim about Mark Kelly, PPP loan In June, Jim Sharpe of KTAR News 92.3 FM asked Kelly where he stood on calls to defund the police: ""Some in your party have called for defunding or even dismantling the police, do you agree with either of these solutions, and if not, what do you think the solutions are?"" Kelly started by saying he was horrified by the killing of George Floyd. He hoped the arrest of the officers involved is ""a first step on a path to justice,"" he said. Kelly added that there were ""deep systemic"" issues with racism in the country and that there should be justice and accountability. ""But I do not agree that we should defund the police, or defund police departments, that’s not the approach here, we need reform of policing,"" Kelly said. ""I’m the son of two cops. I understand the difficulty of this job, but that’s not the approach. More reporting, more transparency, independent oversight, investigations, these are common sense things we can do to get to the point where we don't see situations like these repeatedly in our country.""

""Taking money away from police departments is not a recipe for community success, but changing enforcement tactics is, Democratic Senate candidate Mark Kelly told @AZMorningNews,"" one of the tweets said. Also in June, Kelly’s campaign spokesperson Jacob Peters reiterated in the Arizona Republic that Kelly ""believes we need to reform policing, not defund police departments."" Peters told PolitiFact, ""Mark has been clear, he does not support defunding the police."" We found no social media posts or other media interviews from Kelly that supported McSally’s claim. In a series of tweets related to Floyd on June 6, Kelly said he supported peaceful protests, called for ""accountability and a just system that doesn't discriminate against anyone because of race"" and said ""urgent action and long term commitment"" was needed. His tweets did not say he supported defunding the police. McSally said Kelly wants to ""defund the police."" Kelly has opposed defunding the police.

","A widespread Facebook post wrongly claims that a loophole in mail-in voting would let people cast two ballots without election officials catching on to the scheme. The supposed trick: Vote once by mail, and then a second time in person before the mail-in ballot gets counted. ""This is real,"" says the Aug. 20 post, which has been shared thousands of times on the platform. ""If I mail in my ballot on Sunday and show up to the polling station on Tuesday, they won’t know if I’ve already voted or not. That, my friends, is a serious concern for all of us."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Like claims that receiving multiple mail ballot applications means voters can return multiple ballots, it’s inaccurate.  The Associated Press has debunked the same claim, and elections experts told PolitiFact that every state has procedures to detect and prevent such double voting. ""The entire premise is wrong,"" said Matthew Weil, director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank in Washington. ""All states have controls in place specifically to address this,"" added Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""States handle this differently, but the principle is that you only get to vote once."" Typically, experts said, poll books used for in-person voting will indicate whether you received a vote-by-mail or absentee ballot (there’s no objective difference between the two). What happens when you show up in person depends on the state’s laws and the type of poll book used. In general, experts described a handful of ways election systems would handle the Facebook post’s hypothetical scenario, assuming you are duly registered to vote in the first place: You show up to vote on Tuesday. The poll worker notes that you were issued a mail-in ballot. You brought the mail-in ballot with you, so you surrender it and vote in person.  You show up to vote on Tuesday. The poll worker notes that you were issued a mail-in ballot. You don’t have your mail-in ballot with you. The poll worker lets you submit a provisional ballot, which election officials count only if the mail-in ballot doesn't show up.  You show up to vote on Tuesday. The poll worker notes that you were issued a mail-in ballot. The poll book is electronic, so the poll worker lets you vote in person and updates the book, which notifies the election office that you did so. When your mail-in ballot arrives later, election officials reject it and count the in-person ballot instead. You show up to vote on Tuesday. The poll worker notes that you were issued a mail-in ballot. The poll book indicates that your ballot has already been accepted for counting and removed from its return envelope. You are not allowed to vote in person.  You show up to vote on Tuesday. The poll worker notes that you were issued a mail-in ballot. The poll book indicates that your ballot has already been accepted for counting and removed from its return envelope. You dispute this and submit a provisional ballot, which election officials count only if the record proves to be erroneous.  Some states detail their procedures online. In California, for example, voters who receive vote-by-mail ballots but want to vote in person can hand over their mail-in ballot and vote in person, or fill out a provisional ballot. But in each case, only one vote per person counts.  All mail-in ballots require verification before being counted. Matt Dietrich, a spokesperson for the Illinois State Board of Elections, said mail ballots in Illinois are ""extremely carefully tracked and verified,"" with return envelopes that contain bar codes for the voter’s unique voter ID number. There are reasons why people who request mail-in ballots might legitimately show up at the polls, said Lorraine Minnite, an associate professor of public policy at Rutgers University, Camden. ""People anticipate needing to vote by mail, and then their plans change and they show up at the polls,"" Minnite said. ""Or sometimes, in the case of people whose memories are failing, they don't remember having voted a month or two before an election and proceed to the polls on Election Day, only to find out that they have already voted."" But as an intentional double-voting scheme, the process described in the Facebook post ""is not a viable loophole,"" Dietrich said. In fact, it’s a surefire way to get caught committing voter fraud.  ""This is an easy felony to prove because the voter would be signing his or her name twice — once on the mail ballot and then again at the polling place,"" Dietrich said. Weil, the director of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Elections Project, agreed: ""It’s one of the most obvious ways to get caught because you’re not actually casting any ballot that they don’t know about ... You’d be giving them all the evidence they need to show that you double voted."" Weil said voters hoping to cast their ballots by mail should send them in early, rather than waiting until the Sunday before Election Day, to ensure that they are received on time and counted. RELATED: How to make sure your ballot is counted this fall A Facebook post said, ""If I mail in my ballot on Sunday and show up to the polling station on Tuesday, they won’t know if I’ve already voted or not."" That wouldn’t work in practice. All states have procedures in place to prevent double voting, and people who try it are likely to get caught.

Trump’s claim linking crime rates to bail reform lacks evidence
","President Donald Trump claimed former Vice President Joe Biden and the ""radical left"" want to ""abolish the suburbs,"" shut down charter schools, and release ""criminals onto our streets,"" during a recent speech in Pennsylvania.  He also took aim at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and mentioned New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.  ""Look at what happened in New York,"" Trump said. ""Cuomo ended cash bail. Cuomo. That wasn’t even DeBlasio that did it. It was Cuomo, the governor. He ended it in New York, and now the crime rate has gone through the roof."" We were curious whether changes to state laws governing cash bail could be linked to an increase in crime.  Trump claims Cuomo ""ended cash bail.""  Statutory changes over how and when New York judges can impose cash bail took effect in January, with the intent of keeping people accused of certain crimes out of jail while they await trial, regardless of their ability to afford bail.  The changes allow judges to set bail for mostly violent crimes but not for lesser crimes. Further changes were included in the state budget, finalized in April. These changes allow for more situations in which judges can set bail, and more crimes are eligible for bail, such as sex trafficking offenses, first-degree grand larceny, and escape from custody. The newer changes followed some cases in which people who were released under the new law went on to be charged with other crimes.  Trump also claims that crime rates in New York are ""through the roof."" Those who study crime rates said that compared with last year, there has been an increase in certain violent crimes, including shootings and homicides in New York City, while occurrences of other crimes, such as sex offenses, have fallen.  The New York City Police Department reported earlier this month that shootings, homicides, burglaries and car thefts were on the rise. Murder is up 30 percent in New York City in the first seven months of 2020, compared with the same period in 2019, while shootings are up 72 percent during the same period.  In Buffalo, the homicide rate for the first six months of 2020 was higher than it’s been since at least 2007, according to an analysis by The Buffalo News.  But the increases in murders year-over-year have been happening in many other cities across the country, not just in those in New York state, and in places where there hasn’t been bail reform. Meanwhile, other categories of violent and non-violent crime are down.  Trump made a connection between New York’s bail reforms and the crime rate.  We reached out to four people who study crime data and a top official at a statewide organization that represents prosecutors, and they told us that it is too early to say whether there is a link between bail reform and more crimes.  More data is needed, they said. They also cautioned this year's upheavals in the economy, education, and housing caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could be affecting crime rates. Also unrelated to bail reform, some people being held in jails and prisons were released because of the threat of the new coronavirus.  It’s going to be ""very difficult to parse what is driving crime rates if indeed they remain high in the coming years,"" said Erica Bond, policy director at the Data Collaborative for Justice at John Jay College.  An accurate analysis would look at crimes committed by people who have been released under the new bail laws, and any analysis would cover at least six or 12 months, though the pandemic complicates this year’s data, they said. They also said that the increase in murders is likely not due to low-level offenders being released into the community before trial.  ""The people out on bail reform should be low-level offenders,"" said Christopher Herrmann, a former member of the NYPD who analyzed statistics there and now teaches and does research at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.  Insha Rahman writes about bail reform, including New York’s new laws, and is director of strategy and new initiatives at the Vera Institute of Justice, which favors reducing the use of jails. Rahman said the best data-driven analysis of the relationship between the new bail law and crime rates that she has read was done by reporters at the New York Post.  The Post looked at reports from the New York City Police Department, and found that people who were released from jail under bail reform did not contribute to the city’s rising number of shootings.  ""Though the city logged 528 shooting incidents through June 30 — a 46 percent spike from the 362 tallied at the same point last year — just one person released under the statewide bail reform laws passed Jan. 1 has been charged with a shooting, according to a breakdown provided by the NYPD,"" the Post reported in July.  Less than 1 percent of the people released from Rikers Island under bail reform were involved in any shootings, and more than half of those are not accused of any wrongdoing, they were identified as witnesses or victims, the Post found.  We reached out to the White House three times for evidence of Trump’s claim but did not receive a reply.  NYPD officials, including Commissioner Dermot Shea, have pointed to bail reform as a reason for an increase in crime. In March, the department reported that more than 480 people who were released under the new law committed other crimes. We asked the NYPD twice for any evidence of a link between bail reform and crime rates but did not receive a reply.  The New York Times, earlier this month, reported that a confidential city analysis of police data found little if any link between bail reform and an increase in violence.  Trump said that Cuomo ""ended cash bail"" and now the crime rate has gone up. The White House offered no evidence in support of this claim.  Cuomo signed changes to cash bail into law, but many violent felonies and other crimes, such as sex offenses, are still eligible for bail.   In New York City, some violent crimes have increased, but not all violent crimes.  Crime researchers we spoke with said that more analysis is needed to determine whether the changes to cash bail have led to any increase in crime, but there is not strong evidence suggesting that. In fact, preliminary analyses do not support Trump's claim.  We rate Trump’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097211D00>],/factchecks/2020/aug/29/donald-trump/trumps-claim-linking-crime-rates-bail-reform-lacks/

Fact-checking Trump’s frequent claim that Joe Biden ‘abandoned Scranton’
","Hours before Joe Biden accepted the Democratic presidential nomination, President Donald Trump held a campaign rally just outside Biden’s childhood hometown and accused him of having ""abandoned"" the place. Biden was 10 when his family moved away from Scranton.  Speaking to supporters gathered in Old Forge, Pa., Trump said this about Biden and Scranton:  ""He keeps talking about, ‘I was born in Scranton. I lived in Scranton.’ Yeah, for a few years, and then he left for another state. You know the state. But this Scranton stuff. That’s why I figured I’d come here and explain to you one thing. But I think you people know it better than I do. He left! He abandoned Pennsylvania. He abandoned Scranton."" Biden’s family did move to Delaware when he was a kid. But Trump’s retelling is a distortion of Biden’s enduring relationship with his hometown. Our research shows that Biden maintained close personal relationships and professional ties to Scranton in the more than six decades since he left.  Trump and his campaign also say Biden abandoned the people of Scranton less literally by supporting free trade policies that decimated the city’s manufacturing sector. We’ll get to that one in a bit. Biden’s Scranton roots trace back to 1851, when his paternal great-great-grandfather Patrick Blewitt left Ireland after the potato famine and immigrated to the city. He was an engineer who helped design the layout of Scranton’s streets. Biden’s maternal great-grandfather James Finnegan also came to Scranton after his father immigrated from Ireland in 1849.  Biden’s parents and both sets of grandparents met in Scranton.  He lived in the city until 1953, when his father, who had been commuting to Wilmington to clean boilers for a heating and cooling company, decided to move the family there. But Biden continued to spend most of his summers and holidays with his mother’s family in Green Ridge, the predominantly Irish Catholic Scranton neighborhood of his early childhood. In a 2010 interview with GQ, Biden said he visits Scranton often and quipped that he shows up ""anytime Scranton needs something.""  ""I don’t know how to say no to them. For real. I really don’t,"" Biden said. ""You know, it’s still home.""  He returned to Scranton at least half-a-dozen times in the 1970s after he became a U.S. senator from Delaware, Scranton Times-Tribune clips show.  Biden spoke at the annual Friendly Sons of St. Patrick of Lackawanna County dinner in 1973, a few weeks after losing his first wife and his daughter in a deadly car accident and being sworn into office at his sons’ hospital bedside. In 1976, he was the University of Scranton’s undergraduate commencement speaker. And in 1978, he held a campaign fundraiser dubbed a ""Scranton Salute,"" where then-Mayor Gene Hickey gave him a key to the city. Two Republicans, former Lackawanna County Commissioner Robert Pettinato and former Sheriff Joseph Wincovitch, helped host the fundraiser. Throughout his time in Congress, Biden was often called the state’s ""third senator."" Biden’s Scranton ties have even been satirized twice by Saturday Night Live.   During his tenure as vice president and while campaigning, Biden visited the greater Scranton area at least 15 times, his official schedule shows, including in 2011 after flooding from Tropical Storm Lee caused hundreds of millions of dollars of property damage in Northeastern Pennsylvania.  After touring the damage, Biden did what he often does when he visits Scranton on business: He caught up with childhood friends. The Times-Tribune reported that Biden met with friends from Green Ridge and their families at the Wilkes-Barre Scranton International Airport before boarding Air Force Two.  One person who wasn’t there that day in 2011 was Charlie Roth, whom Biden had described as his ""closest friend for 54 years"" when he returned to Scranton to eulogize him in 2000.  Another childhood friend of Biden’s was Jimmy Kennedy, a former Scranton district magistrate whom he called ""the maestro of our little gang."" Kennedy’s front porch overlooked the backyard of Biden’s childhood home on North Washington Avenue.  And when Biden entered national politics, his Scranton friends were there to support him.  Kennedy chartered a bus to Wilmington with other Biden supporters from Scranton in 1988 when Biden launched his first bid for the presidency. A Times-Tribune photographer captured him holding a banner at the campaign kickoff there that read, ""Scranton, Pa. Claims Biden."" (Kennedy died last year.)  Two other close friends, Larry Orr and Tom Bell, went to the same school, worshiped at the same parish, and played in the same little league. Both men still live in the greater Scranton area and were quoted in a recent Times-Tribune story remarking that it feels like Biden never left.  ""We used to joke about it,"" Bell, 77, a semi-retired insurance agency owner, told the Tribune. ""He was always here.""    ""There’s nothing phony about him,"" Orr, 77, a retired union electrician, who was an usher at Joe and Neilia Biden’s wedding in August 1966, told the Tribune. ""As far as our friendships, as far as Scranton, he’s not just saying that, he’s not just giving you lip service.""  Bill Conaboy grew up in Scranton, too, and said he saw Biden’s compassion first-hand when his 93-year-old father, a former federal judge, had a heart attack in 2018. Biden drove to Scranton that night and sat at the judge’s hospital bedside with his family. Bill recalled how Biden kissed his father’s forehead and knelt beside him. Former U.S. District Judge Richard P. Conaboy died the next day.  ""For President Trump to suggest that Joe Biden has anything other than deep Scranton roots is just ridiculous,"" said Conaboy, 62, who is president of a regional health care system in Northeastern and Central Pennsylvania. ""We’re honored to know him and honored to consider him a friend."" There’s another, less literal way to assess whether Biden ""abandoned"" Scranton. Did the trade policies he supported harm the city’s workers? Did Biden let other countries ""steal our jobs,"" as Trump claimed in Old Forge? The answer to that question is more nuanced — and central to the economic debate between the two candidates.  The North American Free Trade Agreement that Biden supported in 1993 had a direct impact on Scranton’s manufacturing sector, said Iordanis Petsas cq, who leads the economics department at the University of Scranton. Almost 20,000 manufacturing jobs disappeared in the region between January 1994 when NAFTA took effect, and December 2016, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. But economic policy is complex and multifaceted. Scranton’s manufacturing sector was already in decline before NAFTA, losing 6,000 jobs between 1990 and 1994, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And Petsas noted that Scranton’s education and health sectors exploded over that same period, with 14,000 new jobs added. ""We lost a lot of manufacturing jobs while gaining in other areas,"" Petsas said. ""That result doesn’t mean it’s bad trade policy."" Trump claimed Biden ""abandoned Scranton."" Biden’s family moved from Scranton to Wilmington when he was 10, but he has remained deeply connected to his birthplace for more than six decades. He has returned for commencement speeches and little league games. He’s come back for fundraisers and after floods. He went home to eulogize his childhood best friend and to comfort a mentor’s family as the man lay dying. And while one sector, which was already on the decline, struggled in the wake of policies Biden supported, a leading local economist notes that other sectors have thrived. Trump’s version of what happened after Biden moved away is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. We rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809722C140>],/factchecks/2020/aug/29/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-frequent-claim-joe-biden-aban/

Yes, police gave Kyle Rittenhouse water and thanked his armed group before Kenosha shooting
","The protests and property damage that followed the Kenosha police shooting of Jacob Blake followed a tragically familiar national pattern — until two protesters were shot and killed, allegedly by an armed teenager. Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Illinois who considered himself a militia member, has been charged as an adult with one count each of intentional homicide and reckless homicide for the Aug. 25, 2020, shooting. He’s also charged with attempted intentional homicide for the shooting of a third man. Rittenhouse is awaiting extradition from Illinois. He was able to leave the scene even though, as caught on video, he walked toward police with his hands up as protesters yelled that he had shot people. The relationship between Rittenhouse and police has drawn particular scrutiny in the wake of video interactions captured earlier in the night. One viral Facebook post on Aug. 26, 2020, said ""video showed police thank him & give him water prior to the killings."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Did police really have such an interaction with Rittenhouse before the deadly protest shooting? A livestream posted by The Rundown Live, an independent radio program based in Milwaukee, shows Rittenhouse interacting with police while standing in front of a store in Kenosha shortly before the shooting. About 10 p.m., the man shooting the video approaches an armed Rittenhouse, who introduces himself as Kyle, as he stands outside a business with another armed man. Later in the nearly two-hour video, Rittenhouse tells the man shooting the video, ""People are getting injured, and our job is to protect this business, and part of my job is also to help people. If there’s somebody hurt, I’m running into harm’s way. That’s why I have my rifle, because I need to protect myself obviously. But I also have my med kit."" About 90 minutes into the livestream at 11:30 p.m. — 15 minutes before the fatal shooting — the following exchange with police occurs as Rittenhouse and another armed man walk outside a business. Police officer (over a loudspeaker): ""You need water? Seriously. (unintelligible) You need water?"" Rittenhouse, raising his arm and walking toward the police vehicle: ""We need water."" Police officer: ""We’ll throw you one."" Rittenhouse then walks out into the street amid several police vehicles, holding his hand in the air for a water bottle. An officer surfaces from a hatch at the top of the police vehicle and tosses a water bottle to a person located just out of the camera’s view, where Rittenhouse would likely be standing based on the preceding footage. Police officer: ""We got a couple. We’ve got to save a couple, but we’ll give you a couple. We appreciate you guys, we really do."" A police officer on a loudspeaker then directs orders, apparently to another group. Police officer: ""You’re going to have to get out of there. This is the last warning. You’re going to have to move south or you’re going to have to get out of this block. This is the last warning. You will disperse."" Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth said in an Aug. 28, 2020, news conference that the armored vehicle shown in the video is one of 19 being used in the area but wasn’t from his department. He noted people have a Second Amendment right to bear arms to protect ""their property,"" but local authorities had not asked them to come. It is unclear from the video what law enforcement agency the vehicle belonged to.  ""The comments that whoever was in that armored vehicle said, that does not reflect what we here in Kenosha are asking for,"" Beth said. Beth had initially responded to the incident, on Aug. 26, by saying police in Kenosha ""would toss a water to anybody."" A Facebook post says of Rittenhouse: ""Video showed police thank him & give him water prior to the killings."" Video taken 15 minutes before Rittenhouse allegedly shot and killed two people shows exactly that. Police thanked his group for their presence and gave them water.

'Perfectly legal' for Rittenhouse to carry a gun? False
","EDITOR'S NOTE, Nov. 16, 2021: Judge Bruce Schroeder recently dismissed a misdemeanor charge of possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18 against Kyle Rittenhouse. Readers asked us if this made the fact-check below invalid. We don’t think so. Here’s why.  In August 2020, we fact-checked a claim that it was ""perfectly legal"" for Rittenhouse to possess an AR-15 without parental supervision. Our reporting found that it was far from perfectly legal, and that it was, in fact, legally murky. That’s why we rated the claim False. Wisconsin law says that ""any person under 18 years of age who possesses or goes armed with a dangerous weapon is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor."" In our fact-check, we cite the possibility of an exception for rifles and shotguns. The exception is aimed at letting children ages 16 and 17 hunt. But, as it is also clear, Rittenhouse wasn’t in Kenosha to hunt. This same legal debate played out a couple of times during the Rittenhouse trial, according to the Associated Press.  Rittenhouse’s defense asked Schroeder to dismiss the firearm possession charge during a pretrial hearing in October. Schroeder, according to the Associated Press, acknowledged the intent of the statute was murky but decided not to dismiss the charge. The issue came up again on Nov. 15 as lawyers were debating instructions to the jury.  Prosecutors argued that allowing an exception for hunting-style weapons would effectively eliminate the prohibition on minors carrying weapons. But in this instance, Schroeder dismissed the charge, saying he had a ""big problem"" with the state statute. In its reporting, the Associated Press quoted Kenosha defense attorney Michael Cicchini, who is not involved in the case. Cicchini said when statutes aren't clear, they must be read in favor of the defense. ""This is the price the government must pay when it is incapable of drafting clear laws,"" Cicchini wrote in an article. The ruling does appear at odds with the intent of legislators. In 2018, the Wisconsin Legislative Council Staff, a nonpartisan legislative service agency akin to the Congressional Research Service, wrote that, ""Under Wisconsin law, with certain exceptions for hunting, military service, and target practice, a person under age 18 is generally prohibited from possessing or going armed with a firearm."" These subsequent events show the grey areas of local gun laws — hardly a case of something being ""perfectly legal."" Our fact-check remains unchanged. • • • The 17-year-old accused of shooting three people during a protest in Kenosha, Wis., faces several charges, including first-degree intentional homicide. But some widely shared Facebook posts say he should be cleared of at least some of them. In an Aug. 27 post, one Facebook user said it was ""perfectly legal"" for Kyle Rittenhouse — who was arrested in Antioch, Ill., after fleeing Wisconsin — to brandish an assault-style rifle on the streets of Kenosha. ""Carrying a rifle across state lines is perfectly legal,"" the poster said. ""Based on the laws I can find of this area at 17 years old Kyle was perfectly legal to be able to possess that rifle without parental supervision."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On Aug. 25, two protesters were killed and one injured after police say someone opened fire on them. The violence occurred on the third night of protests over the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by a white police officer in Kenosha. Blake survived, but he is partially paralyzed from a bullet that severed his spinal cord. Rittenhouse stands accused of shooting the protesters. Since his lawyer has said that Rittenhouse obtained the assault-style rifle from a friend in Wisconsin (meaning that he didn’t transport it with him from Illinois), we’re going to focus on the second half of the claim — that it was ""perfectly legal"" for the teenager to carry a firearm in Kenosha.  Is that true? State laws suggest not. The Wisconsin Department of Justice honors concealed carry permits issued in Illinois. But Rittenhouse did not have a permit to begin with, and he was not legally old enough to carry a firearm in Wisconsin. In Illinois, concealed carry applicants must be at least 21 years old. Since Rittenhouse is 17, he would not qualify for a permit. In Wisconsin, it is legal for adults to carry firearms in public without a license if the gun is visible. However, to open carry, you must be at least 18 years old. Wisconsin law stipulates that ""any person under 18 years of age who possesses or goes armed with a dangerous weapon is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor."" On Aug. 27, prosecutors charged Rittenhouse with a misdemeanor count of possession of a dangerous weapon under the age of 18, according to court records. John Monroe, an attorney who specializes in gun rights, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that there’s an exception for rifles and shotguns, which is aimed at letting children ages 16 and 17 hunt, that could apply. But Rittenhouse wasn’t in Kenosha to hunt. The newspaper reported that — based on interviews, videos and social media posts — Rittenhouse considered himself to be a militia member protecting private property. His Facebook page, which has since been taken down, had several posts expressing support for police. RELATED: What we know about Jacob Blake's shooting in Kenosha, Wis. ""People are getting injured and our job is to protect this business,"" Rittenhouse told the Daily Caller in a video interview before the shooting. ""And my job also is to protect people. If someone is hurt, I’m running into harm’s way. That’s why I have my rifle; I’ve gotta protect myself, obviously. But I also have my med kit."" We reached out to the person who published the Facebook post for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. Whether Rittenhouse violated Wisconsin law by possessing a firearm underage is the subject of ongoing litigation. But the Facebook post claimed that it was ""perfectly legal"" for the teenager to carry an assault-style rifle in Kenosha. At best, that’s unproven. At worst, it’s inaccurate. Either way, we rate the post False. UPDATE, Sept. 3, 2020: This fact-check has been updated to include mention that Wisconsin law permits people 18 years and older to carry firearms in public without a license if the gun is visible. The ruling is unchanged.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C187200>],/factchecks/2020/aug/28/facebook-posts/did-kyle-rittenhouse-break-law-carrying-assault-st/

Claim that Evers, Barnes did not call for peace, calm after Blake shooting goes too far
","The national protests over police brutality that started in Minnesota after a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd by kneeling for nearly nine minutes on his neck have now focused squarely on Wisconsin. On Sunday August 23, 2020, a Kenosha police officer shot Jacob Blake in the back multiple times at close range as Blake tried to get into a small SUV. Protests re-ignited across the country, including in Madison and, of course, Kenosha, where buildings were vandalized and burned, windows smashed out and stores looted.  State Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, decried the destruction in an August 25, 2020, news release and Facebook post.   ""There is absolutely no justification for the vandalism, destruction, rioting and looting that took place at the State Capitol, in the City of Madison or the City of Kenosha last night,"" Marklein posted on Facebook. Then he took aim at the state’s Democratic leaders. ""We need leadership in this state to take a stand, protect our citizens and call for peace, rather than capitulating to violent mobs. Governor Tony Evers and Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes made irresponsible comments about the incident in Kenosha before having all of the facts. They did not call for peace. They did not encourage calm.""  The statement came before a night of chaos involving protesters and armed militia members left two men dead and a third man injured. Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, of Antioch, Ill., is charged with shooting the men. Rittenhouse is a self-described militia member. We’ll focus on the last part of Marklein’s claim.  Did Evers and Barnes ""not call for peace"" and ""not encourage calm"" in the wake of the Blake shooting? When asked to provide backup for the statement, Katy Prange, Marklein’s chief of staff, focused on the timing and context of statements made by Evers and Barnes. Let’s look at the sequence.  Here is the complete August 23, 2020 news release from the governor’s office, hours after the incident: MADISON — Gov. Evers tonight released the following statement regarding the officer-involved shooting that critically injured a Black man in Kenosha. ""Tonight, Jacob Blake was shot in the back multiple times, in broad daylight, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Kathy and I join his family, friends, and neighbors in hoping earnestly that he will not succumb to his injuries. While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country. We stand with all those who have and continue to demand justice, equity, and accountability for Black lives in our country—lives like those of George Floyd, of Breonna Taylor, Tony Robinson, Dontre Hamilton, Ernest Lacy, and Sylville Smith. And we stand against excessive use of force and immediate escalation when engaging with Black Wisconsinites. I have said all along that although we must offer our empathy, equally important is our action. In the coming days, we will demand just that of elected officials in our state who have failed to recognize the racism in our state and our country for far too long."" There was no call for peace or calm in the statement. The following morning, Evers’s office issued a video message:  In the video address, neither Evers nor Barnes mentioned the violence or damage from the previous night, but they did ask that those protesting ""do so peacefully.""  Marklein’s statement was posted on Facebook at 11:06 a.m. the next day, August 25. So, that’s our starting point for the accuracy of the claim. We also looked at Barnes’ tweets and Facebook posts, but did not find any reference to calling for peace or calm prior to Marklein’s post. In a news release later that day, Evers said: ""Tonight, and in the days ahead, if you are going to protest, please do so peacefully and safely. Please do not allow the actions of a few distract us from the work we must do together to demand justice, equity, and accountability.""  So, clearly, that statement from Evers -- his strongest on the question of peace and calm -- came after Marklein’s claim. Britt Cudaback, Evers’ deputy communications director, argued Evers had called for a peaceful protest the day before Marklein’s claim, citing the video message Barnes’ communications director Chet Agni, said Marklein was making ""broad claims.""  ""Our administration has been calling for people to exercise their First Amendment rights peacefully and safely since before Sen. Marklein released his statement, just as our administration did during the unrest following the murder of George Floyd months ago,"" he said in an email. That said, our research, and the information provided by the offices of Evers and Barnes, shows a single reference to ""peacefully"" before the Marklein statement was made. Marklein claimed that Evers and Barnes,  after the police shooting of Jacob Blake, ""did not call for peace. They did not encourage calm."" The governor did not call for peace and calm in his statement hours after the incident. But in a video statement posted the next day, Evers urged people planning to protest to ""do so peacefully."" That said, his most direct comments -- saying the Kenosha protests went too far -- didn’t come until after Marklein’s statement.  We rate Marklein’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970235C0>],/factchecks/2020/aug/28/howard-marklein/claim-evers-barnes-did-not-call-peace-calm-after-b/

Two mail-in ballots sent to one person doesn’t mean they can vote twice
","Some Pennsylvania residents in Pittsburgh’s Allegheny County received duplicate mail-in ballots in May 2020 due to a computer glitch that caused an error during the printing process. Posts circulating on social media, which appear to share an image of two of the county’s ballots addressed to the same person, suggest the error proves that the vote-by-mail system is susceptible to voter fraud. ""Two mail in ballots in PA sent to the same person with their names on both a week and a half apart. FB keeps deleting this. Make it go viral,"" reads text above the image. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  RELATED: No, receiving multiple ballot applications doesn’t let you vote more than once The image is blurry, and we were unable to confirm that the papers in it were indeed official mail-in ballots, but several areas of the document point to Allegheny County, which mistakenly sent duplicate mail ballots to some residents in May. The underlying suggestion that two ballots mailed to the same person gives someone the ability to cast more than one vote is wrong. If a person returned multiple ballots, the system would flag it as a duplicate vote and only one would be counted. Allegheny County erroneously sent some residents multiple mail-in ballots ahead of the state’s primary election on June 2, according to news reports. The incident was included in a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump’s campaign, which claims that election officials in Pennsylvania have implemented a fraudulent mail voting system that will undermine the results of the general election on Nov. 3. In a May 14 news release, the county said duplicate labels for mail-in and absentee ballots were printed because of a glitch in the state’s computerized voter registry system.  As the system processed and printed a large volume of mailing labels for ballots, at some point, it paused and sent an error message, which resulted in a queue of labels that appeared to be blank. But the labels were actually still printing, so when the system rebooted, some printed twice, the release said. The county said it was going to start printing labels in smaller batches to prevent the error from occurring again, and that affected residents should destroy any duplicate ballots. ""Even if a person receives multiple ballots, only one return ballot can be counted. This is because the barcode on the label that is being used for tracking is exactly the same,"" the release noted.  ""When voted ballots are returned to the office, they are scanned. If another ballot was returned from that same voter, it would show as a duplicate vote when scanned and would be rejected by the system. Staff would mark the ballot as rejected. Those ballots are kept but are not sent to the warehouse to be counted or opened."" An image appears to show two mail-in ballots addressed to one Pennsylvania resident, suggesting this means they could vote twice. It’s accurate that a group of residents in Allegheny County, Pa., received duplicate mail ballots due to a computer glitch ahead of the state’s primary election in June, and the photo in the post appears to show an example of the error. But it’s wrong to suggest that this means they can cast multiple votes. The system uses one barcode for each voter. If a duplicate is scanned, election officials would mark the ballot as rejected. We rate this Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A394E80>],/factchecks/2020/aug/28/facebook-posts/two-mail-ballots-sent-one-person-doesnt-mean-they-/

No, the alleged Kenosha shooter’s father isn’t with the Kenosha sheriff’s department
","A Facebook post suggests that the father of the young man arrested for killing two protesters and wounding a third in Kenosha, Wisc., is himself a law enforcement officer. ""Wondering about Kyle Rittenhouse’s father?"" the post says. ""Call the Kenosha Sheriff’s department and ask for Deputy Rittenhouse."" This is made up. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The county’s employee database has no Rittenhouse. The sheriff’s department lists 10 staffers. The Rittenhouse name doesn’t appear. We called the department and they don’t know of any employee by that name. We checked with the City of Kenosha and the human resources department told us no Rittenhouse has worked for the city in any capacity. Kyle Rittenhouse has been strongly drawn to police work. He supported the Blue Lives Matter movement on social media. He participated in a youth training program for aspiring law enforcement officers.  Aside from the post having zero basis in reality, Rittenhouse lives with his single mother, a nurse’s assistant, in Antioch, Ill,, not Wisconsin. Court records from 2014 show that Kyle Rittenhouse's, Michael Rittenhouse, was living in Zion, Ill., when he was ordered to pay $85 a week in child support. At the time, he worked for QPS Employment, a firm that provides temporary office workers and other staffing services.   We rate the post Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C236200>],/factchecks/2020/aug/28/viral-image/no-alleged-kenosha-shooters-father-isnt-kenosha-sh/

Melania Trump is not the first FLOTUS to visit troops in a combat zone in 50 years
","A Facebook post claims that Melania Trump is the first president’s wife to visit troops in a combat zone since 1969. That’s not true. At least two former first ladies have traveled to greet U.S. troops in designated combat zones since then. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  There is no record of any first lady traveling to an area under an active attack. The IRS defines ""combat zone"" as a general term that ""includes all of the following hostile areas where military may serve: actual combat areas, direct combat support areas, and qualified hazardous duty areas. With respect to deadline extensions, the term ‘combat zone(s)’ includes contingency operations areas."" First lady Melania Trump traveled with President Donald Trump to Al Asad Airbase in Iraq in a surprise visit to troops on Dec. 26, 2018. Before that, Michelle Obama made a 2015 visit to troops at the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, a combat zone since 1991. Laura Bush visited Afghanistan in 2005 and 2008 and made stops to meet with troops. The country has been a combat zone since the U.S. invaded in 2001. Pat Nixon accompanied President Richard Nixon to visit troops in South Vietnam in 1969, the Associated Press reported. Hillary Clinton visited Bosnia as first lady in 1996, the trip implicated in her Pants on Fire claim that her plane landed under ""sniper fire."" But it was considered a ""hostile area,"" and not a combat zone, the AP reported.

Jill Biden has not called for mandatory Spanish if Joe Biden wins presidency
","Jill Biden is studying Spanish. But there’s no reason to believe she  would force everyone to do so if her husband is elected president, as a Facebook post claims.  The Aug. 26 post said: ""Dr. Jill Biden: ‘All Americans Will Be Required to Learn Spanish When We Win."" The post states that the information came from the New York Post, but included no link to another article. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). A separate website intended to trick viewers into thinking it is the New York Post made a similar claim that Jill Biden, an English teacher, called for requiring people to learn Spanish. But we found no actual New York Post article that backs up the claim. Some posts show images of Biden giving her Aug. 18 speech at the Democratic National Convention or her June 30 interview with ""The View,"" but in neither one did she suggest mandatory Spanish under a Joe Biden presidency. The Washington Post reported that Jill Biden is studying Spanish on Babbel, a mobile app for learning languages. The vast majority of people in the U.S. speak only English at home according to the census data, while about 21.5% speak another language, with Spanish being the most common.  About 13% speak Spanish at home. We found no evidence that Jill Biden said that if her husband wins everyone will have to learn Spanish in the U.S. We find this claim falso y ridículo, so we rate it Pants on Fire!
