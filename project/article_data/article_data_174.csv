Scott Walker says Mark Neumann = Nancy Pelosi
","
Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Walker’s new statewide TV ad hits the trifecta, touching on three hot-buttons issues in this election cycle: transportation spending, earmarks and ties to a Democratic Party whose popularity has sagged.

In a direct-mail piece, radio ad and TV spot, Walker mocks GOP rival Mark Neumann’s claim that he is a true conservative and Washington outsider crusading against wasteful spending. Following a national Republican strategy of tying Democratic candidates to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Walker aims to do the same with Republican Neumann, who served two terms in Congress in the 1990s.

Is the Neumann-Pelosi comparison accurate?

Let’s focus on the TV ad, which echoes the approach on the radio and in direct mail.

It features a crude hand puppet figure of Neumann, his eyes shifting. It ticks off a series of complaints, all focused on a single 1998 vote on a controversial transportation spending bill:

""Mark Neumann says he’s against big government spending,"" the ad begins. ""But in 1998, Congressman Neumann voted for one of the largest transportation bills in history. A bill that contained $9 billion in pork barrel spending. Including funding for the infamous bridge to nowhere.
And a highway in Canada. You know who else voted for that $9 billion in pork barrel spending?
Nancy Pelosi.""

As a Pelosi puppet pops out from behind Neumann, the narrator says: ""Take a closer look at Mark Neumann. Remind you of anyone?"" 
(Note: On Sept. 8, the Walker campaign changed the ending of the ad to say Neumann's excuse for the vote was that lots of others voted for it, too. The ad retained the Pelosi image. A new direct mail piece continued to use the ""remind you of anyone?"" line.) 
With the Sept. 14 primary approaching, Walker is also running a second radio ad, making a similar link based on a different bill.

The point of the ads is more sweeping than comparing individual votes. Walker is likening Neumann to Pelosi. So in this item, we'll be examining whether he is correct to equate them.

Neumann did join Pelosi and 295 other House members in backing the transportation bill. There were 86 votes against it. The exact tally: 143 Republicans in favor, 56 against. On the Democratic side, 153 supported and 30 voted no. One independent voted aye, according to congressional records.

The bill was described by the Los Angeles Times and Washington Post as the largest transportation legislation in history. Media accounts also scored the bill as one of the most pork-laden of all time, funding $9 billion in ""special projects."" Critics and defenders argued over the need for many of them. The most famous, of course, was the ""bridge to nowhere""in Alaska -- a familiar topic to political watchers.

A big majority of both parties voted for the bill. In the Wisconsin delegation, three Republicans supported it, and one was opposed. Among state Democrats, three supported it and two voted no  (including Tom Barrett, now running for governor). Their reasons were all over the map, creating a list of strange bedfellows.

For instance, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Menomonee Falls) opposed the bill. But then-House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) -- a prominent conservative -- supported it, along with Neumann. Armey is now a leader of the tea party movement.

How wide-ranging was the bill?

Scott Walker himself, then a member of the state Assembly, applauded a piece of it  -- sponsored by U.S. Rep. Tom Petri (R-Fond du Lac) -- that lifted a requirement that $241 million in federal money be used on either a light rail system or freeway bus and car-pool lanes in the East-West Corridor between Milwaukee and Waukesha.

Walker spoke up in the week after the bill passed, as the leader of a bipartisan group of six  Milwaukee County lawmakers.

The ad is correct in stating Neumann voted for the measure.

Neumann said he liked a provision in the bill that assured the federal share of the gas tax wouldn’t be used for other purposes. The legislation included a ""minimum guarantee,"" according to a U.S. House committee report, to make sure states received more funding.

Now let’s look at the Neumann and Pelosi comparison.

Walker’s campaign says the ad does not try to tag Pelosi and Neumann as kindred voters, except for on this particular vote. But that is the implication of the ad.

And it’s a reach.

Pelosi, House speaker since January 2007, was not in a leadership position at the time. In fact, Republicans controlled the chamber.

On most important votes involving spending and taxes, Pelosi, who represents San Francisco, and Neumann, who represented southern Wisconsin, were polar opposites.

During his four years in Congress from 1995 to 1998, Neumann earned an ""A"" grade from the National Taxpayers Union, a group that believes taxpayers are overburdened and pushes for reforms in the federal tax system.

During those same years, Pelosi earned an ""F.""

The group says an ""A"" indicates the legislator is ""one of the strongest supporters of responsible tax and spending policies."" By contrast, an ""F"" means the lawmaker is a ""big spender.""

We turned to the Washington Post’s database of votes to sample Neumann and Pelosi’s record  in the 105th Congress, the one in which the 1998 vote occurred. Of the 17 pieces of legislation deemed most prominent, Neumann and Pelosi agreed on six.

The bills included four appropriations measures, an IRS reform bill and the transportation bill. On the six, Congress was nearly unanimous in approving three. In all but one -- an appropriations bill -- Neumann voted with the GOP majority.

All told, in the 105th Congress, Pelosi voted with her party 89.9 percent of the time, the Post data shows. Neumann voted with Republicans on 86.6 percent, the Post data shows.

So, where does that leave us?

Walker’s claims on Neumann’s support of the transportation bill are accurate. The vote involved a major spending bill that drew a lot of attention, and Neumann does not dispute he supported it.

But the ad suggests something much larger, that Neumann and Pelosi are somehow ideologically matched. Based on the ratings from an outside group and the lawmakers’ voting record, the two rarely lined up. Indeed, by the standard of linking them on a single vote, Neumann could as easily have been paired with Armey as Pelosi.

Using Walker’s logic, Walker could have linked himself to Pelosi. After all, he supported a provision in the bill at the time. Walker wouldn’t agree with that comparison. And we don’t agree with the Neumann-Pelosi one. We rate the connection False.",/factchecks/2010/sep/09/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-mark-neumann-nancy-pelosi/

The Republican Party of Texas says Rep. Kristi Thibaut was an ACORN lobbyist
","
Casting your political foe as a lobbyist — and hence beholden to some special interest — can make for explosive campaign fodder. 
So it is that the Republican Party of Texas targets first-term state Rep. Kristi Thibaut, D-Houston. ""Dem State Rep Kristi Thibaut was an #ACORN lobbyist,"" the party tweeted Aug. 31, linking to a web video. Earlier the same day, the party had tweeted: ""Democrat State Rep. Kristi Thibaut, HD133, was a lobbyist for corrupt ACORN"" and before that, ""find out which Dem state Rep was a lobbyist for ACORN."" 
ACORN, or the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, dissolved in March 2010 after a video sting showed ACORN employees in one office telling people posing as a pimp and a prostitute how to conceal their criminal activities. The 40-year-old, liberal-leaning group, which sought more affordable housing options, a universal health care system and increased voter access, also faced questions — mainly from conservatives — about its voter registration drives. 
Congress cut off federal funding to the group in September 2009. 
When we asked the Republican Party to substantiate its claim, spokesman Bryan Preston pointed us to the website kristiworksforacorn.com, where the party posted its research. The web page features a photo of Thibaut with President Obama and links to the web video, which starts with a 2008 audio clip of Thibaut being asked about legislation she'd like to see passed in 2009. ""There's a bill that we got behind and supported... we being ACORN,"" she says. ""Being Acorn"" is repeated in a sound loop, then the web video jumps to TV news coverage of the ACORN-related uproar. 
The GOP notes that according to Thibaut's lobby report filed with the Texas Ethics Commission, Thibaut was registered as an ACORN lobbyist in 2007, and expected to earn between $10,000 and $25,000. Also, Thibaut appeared April 25, 2007, on behalf of ACORN at a committee hearing about a proposed constitutional amendment related to home equity loans, according to a Texas House list of witnesses posted online. 
Also noted on the GOP site: a Feb. 4, 2009, Texas Observer article profiling Thibaut and calling her an ""ACORN activist"" who unsuccessfully lobbied state lawmakers during the 2007 session for lower utility rates. 
We confirmed each of the party's citations from state records. 
Next, Keir Murray, a spokesman for Thibaut's campaign, told us Thibaut was a contract lobbyist for ACORN for the 2007 legislative session. Murray said she ""specifically lobbied around the issue of utility rate reduction and affordable housing."" 
""She's proud of the work she did on behalf of low- and moderate-income Texans,"" he said. ""We've never hid from this."" 
In an e-mail, Murray suggested the GOP attack is a red herring: ""This is a real stretch to equate her work here in Texas, where ACORN was never, to my knowledge, implicated in any 'fraud,' with the salacious accusations leveled at the organization in other states."" 
There was no evidence of ACORN-driven voter registration fraud in Harris Country — Thibaut's home turf — according to a October 2008 Houston Chronicle article. 
So, Thibaut lobbied for ACORN, as the GOP tweet says and her campaign acknowledges, though the linked web video associates Thibaut with ACORN's voter-registration fraud and tax evasion issues; there's no evidence of Thibaut having a connection to such activities. 
Far as it goes, the GOP statement we reviewed is True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/09/republican-party-texas/republican-party-texas-says-rep-kristi-thibaut-was/

Gov. Jan Brewer talks of beheadings in the Arizona desert
","
Defending her state's controversial immigration law she signed on April 23, 2010, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said border violence has gotten so bad there have been beheadings out in the Arizona desert.

That's right, beheadings.

It's a shocking image, but critics say it's also completely made up and an example of fear-mongering of the worst kind used by Brewer to manipulate an already emotional national debate on immigration.

""We cannot afford all this illegal immigration and everything that comes with it, everything from the crime and to the drugs and the kidnappings and the extortion and the beheadings and the fact that people can't feel safe in their community. It's wrong! It's wrong!"" Brewer said in a June 16, 2010, interview with Fox News.

The Republican governor stood by her beheading claim when questioned about it during an interview on Phoenix NBC-affiliate KPNX 12 News on June 25, 2010.

""Oh, our law enforcement agencies have found bodies in the desert, either buried or just lying out there, that have been beheaded,"" she said.

That came as surprising news to Dr. Eric Peters, deputy chief medical examiner for Pima County, which has the largest border with Mexico of any county in Arizona.

""We probably have handled the most deaths from border crossings,"" Peters told PolitiFact. ""We have had approximately 1,700 deaths in the last 10 years. We haven't had a single death due to a beheading or having a beheading associated with it.""

The vast majority of deaths -- more than 95 percent, he said -- were due to exposure to the elements, either extreme heat in the summer or extreme cold in the winter.

The remainder of deaths, less than 5 percent, were ""generally related to the process of human smuggling,"" Peters said. For example, he said, passengers who are killed when a smuggler tries to put too many people in a van and the van rolls or is involved in an accident.

""It's exceedingly rare for the deaths to have anything to do with any type of violence at all, and certainly no beheadings,"" Peters said.

""It's not terribly uncommon that we'd find just a skull,"" Peters said. He then added a grisly (if clinical) explanation: ""As a body decomposes, local animals will use the deceased as a food source and sometimes the head can become dis-articulated from the spine.""

But none from violent beheadings. It would be clear from the bones, Peters said, if there were a ""traumatic removal from the remainder of the body.""

Other medical examiners and law enforcement officials along the border echoed Peters' sentiments.

""We have received no headless bodies from the desert at all,"" said Pinal County spokesman Joe Pyritz.

Reporters from the Arizona Guardian and television station ABC15 talked to several other medical examiners in counties along or near the Mexican border, and all said the same thing: no beheadings there.

We also spoke to Vincent Picard, a spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Phoenix, who told us there have been no cases involving beheadings in any of their investigations.

In a Sept. 1 debate, Brewer's Democratic opponent Terry Goddard called Brewer's beheading comments ""fear-mongering"" that painted an untrue picture of Arizona and hurt the state's economy.

""Jan, I call upon you today to say there are no beheadings,'' Goddard demanded.

She skirted the issue during the debate, but two days later, on Sept. 3, 2010, Brewer walked back her comment in an interview with the Associated Press.

""That was an error, if I said that,"" Brewer said. ""I misspoke, but you know, let me be clear, I am concerned about the border region because it continues to be reported in Mexico that there's a lot of violence going on and we don't want that going into Arizona.""

Escalating cartel-related violence -- including beheadings -- have been widely reported in northern Mexico. And some of those cartels are involved in cross-border smuggling.

But Brewer twice described the beheadings as happening on the U.S. side of the border. And for weeks, she refused to back away from the comment. When Brewer finally acknowledged she had erred, she couched her admission with the qualifier ""if I said said that."" She did. 
This claim, like several others by opponents of illegal immigration, is ridiculously false -- emphasizing a non-existent danger. So we rate her comment Pants On Fire.",/factchecks/2010/sep/08/jan-brewer/gov-jan-brewer-talks-beheadings-th-arizona-desert/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Education', 'States', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama says Boehner doesn't think jobs for teachers, police, firefighters are worth saving
","
President Barack Obama defended his economic policies in a campaign-style speech in Milwaukee on Labor Day, drawing a sharp contrast with Republicans in Congress.

""When it comes to just about everything we've done to strengthen our middle class, to rebuild our economy, almost every Republican in Congress says no,"" Obama said. ""Even on things we usually agree on, they say no. If I said the sky was blue, they say no. If I said fish live in the sea, they'd say no.""

Obama mentioned specific legislation and singled out Republican House leader John Boehner of Ohio for criticism.

""When we passed a bill earlier this summer to help states save jobs -- the jobs of hundreds of thousands of teachers and nurses and police officers and firefighters that were about to be laid off -- they said no. And the Republican who thinks he's going to take over as speaker... when he was asked about this, he dismissed those jobs as 'government jobs' that weren't worth saving. That's what he said, I'm quoting -- 'government jobs.'""

We wanted to check Boehner's comments to see if Obama was making an accurate claim.

Obama signed the bill into law on Aug. 10. It sends $26.1 billion to states facing budget shortfalls, providing $10 billion for salaries and compensation for teachers and another $16.1 million to help states pay for Medicaid, the long-standing government insurance program for the poor and disabled. Medicaid is a major part of state budgets, and Democrats says that this funding will help states avoid cuts to other parts of their budgets that pay for public employees like ""nurses and police officers and firefighters."" We want to be clear that the law only directly funds teachers. The other job categories are potential secondary effects and likely vary by state.

We checked with the White House about what Boehner said about those jobs, and they pointed us to remarks he made in a major speech on the economy in Cleveland on Aug. 24, 2010.

Boehner criticized the Obama administration's economic policies both broadly and in several specifics. One of the news highlights from the speech was Boehner's advice that Obama fire his top economic advisers, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and National Economic Council director Larry Summers.

But Boehner also singled out the state aid package for brief criticism. Businesses, he said, are not creating jobs because of uncertainty about what the federal government will do, something he said he told Obama in a recent meeting.

""Not long after we spoke, he signed a $26 billion 'stimulus' spending bill that funnels money to state governments in order to protect government jobs. And even worse, the bill is funded by a new tax hike that makes it more expensive to create jobs in the United States and less expensive to create jobs overseas. Listen, this cannot continue,"" Boehner said. (The quotes around ""stimulus"" are from the text Boehner's office posted online.)

So, Boehner did call the jobs the bill aimed to save ""government jobs."" To be clear, public school teachers are government employees. But did Boehner say they ""weren't worth saving""?

The quote above is the only time Boehner specifically mentions that law in the speech, but he repeatedly condemns government spending and says that real job creation must come from the private sector. He does not mention the professions of teachers, nurses, police or firefighters, and he never said that ""government jobs"" weren't worth saving.

We asked Boehner spokesman Michael Steel about Obama's charge. He said that Boehner ""did not say that government jobs, 'weren't worth saving.'  The president's statement is inaccurate."" 
(Two days after the Labor Day speech, Obama repeated the remarks in a speech in Cleveland but softened them slightly. This time Obama said that Boehner ""dismissed these jobs – teaching our kids, patrolling our streets, rushing into burning buildings – as quote 'government jobs – jobs that I guess he thought just weren't worth saving."")

Obama's Labor Day statement was accurate in that Boehner did refer did refer to teachers' jobs as government jobs. But the Republican leader did not say government jobs weren't worth saving. He merely said the stimulus was misguided because it put too much emphasis on government spending. So we rate Obama's statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/08/barack-obama/obama-says-boehner-doesnt-think-jobs-teachers-poli/
"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Pam Bondi']","
Pam Bondi says Medicaid will eat up half of state budget in 2015
","
Medicaid is a massive chunk of the state's budget, and Florida's next chief legal officer will play an important role in fighting Medicaid fraud.

Pam Bondi, the Republican candidate for attorney general, said in a July 31, 2010, Bay News 9 debate that ""by the year 2015 (Medicaid will) take up half our budget.""

We wanted to check: Is it really going to eat up half the state's budget in just five years?

But first, some background on Medicaid we pulled from a March 23, 2010, Truth-O-Meter item on Bill McCollum, Florida's attorney general who has since lost the Republican primary for governor. McCollum claimed that the cost for the Medicaid expansion under the new health care reform would be a $1.6 billion a year increase for Florida, which PolitiFact ruled Half True. Here is what PolitiFact said then:

""Medicaid is a joint state-federal, government-run health care program for the very poor. (Its cousin, Medicare, is for senior citizens of any income level.) To get into Medicaid, you have to be not only poor, but also disabled, elderly, pregnant or a child. The new law changes that, opening up Medicaid to all of the poor, setting the limit at people who make less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level. Currently, that means a single person who makes $14,404 or less, and a family of four that has income of less than $29,327.

""Medicaid is actually a voluntary program, so states do not have to participate. But all states do, because the federal government puts up much of the money for the program.""

Now here's where it gets tricky: Under federal health care reform, the numbers on the Medicaid rolls are expected to rise dramatically.

The federal government will pick up the tab for expanding Medicaid for the first few years for the additional poor but the feds aren't picking up the total tab to add those who are currently eligible but not enrolled, said Shelisha Durden and Tiffany Vause, spokeswomen for the state Agency on Health Care Administration. That group of eligible-yet-not-enrolled equals an estimated nearly 200,000 who will be added in the state's 2014-15 fiscal year, according to an Aug. 18 report from AHCA. That addition will cost about $878 million -- of which about $373 million, about 42 percent, will be paid for by the state. Overall by 2014-15, the state predicts adding about 1.2 million people to the rolls.

But Bondi hopes to stop the federal health care reform by continuing Attorney General McCollum's lawsuit seeking to block the mandates.

""Pam believes the federal health care law is unconstitutional and is committed to continuing Florida's legal challenge,"" wrote Bondi's campaign spokeswoman Kim Kirtley.

If AGs in Florida and elsewhere are successful, that could put a damper on Medicaid growth -- throwing a wrench into Bondi's claim.

But for now, there's no question that the Medicaid rolls are growing -- the only question is by how much.

So, back to Bondi's claim that Medicaid will be half the state's budget by 2015.

The July 31 debate is no longer online, but Bay 9 News Director Mike Gautreau pulled up Bondi's quote for us: ""Medicaid makes up 26 percent of our budget. By the year 2015 it’ll take up half our budget. And we have to do everything we can to fight that in South Florida, in north Florida, everywhere it’s prevalent and I have the experience of fighting fraud and taking up for businesses and consumers, for 20 years.""

We reached out to state agencies with expertise on Florida's budget -- including Medicaid.

First, let's discuss what we received from AHCA.

The agency provided the details on the current fiscal year 2010-2011, showing Medicaid expenditures are about $20.2 billion in a state budget of about $70.4 billion. That means for this year, Medicaid represents 28.69 percent of the state budget.

The state's chief economist, Amy Baker, sent us to a report about Florida's financial outlook between 2011 and 2014 that also cites the 28 percent figure and states: ""Medicaid is the second largest single program in the state budget behind public education, representing 28 percent of the total state budget, and is the largest source of federal funding for the state.""

The report from Baker has a chart on page 78 that shows the anticipated growth in caseload: from the 2.7 million average monthly caseload for 2009-10 to 3.3 million in 2013-14 due to federal health care reform. Alan Levine, an expert on Medicaid and a former head of Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration, said that chart doesn't tell the full story because the addition to the Medicaid rolls happens in January 2014 -- half way through the state's fiscal year -- so the full impact won't be seen until the following year.

As for cost, the $20.2 billion for fiscal year 2010-11 is now projected to climb to $25.08 billion in 2013-14 -- about $2 billion of that is due to the federal health care reform. Baker said she did not have a figure for Medicaid total cost in 2014-15 and cautioned against trying to project such an amount beyond three years.

We also asked the Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research -- the folks who create economic forecasts for Florida -- for overall state budget projections through 2015. Since it's Baker's business to project budgets, we asked her advice for the best method to project the proportion of the state budget that Medicaid would eat up by 2013-14. Baker suggested two methods:

First she said we could assume a no-growth rate in the total state budget, which is $70.4 billion for this year. So Baker divided $25.08 billion -- the anticipated Medicaid budget for 2013-14 -- by $70.4 billion -- the total state budget. The result: Medicaid would eat up about 35.6 percent of the state's budget under a no-growth scenario in the state budget.

But Baker said we know the state budget probably will grow based on the recent past. She said taking into account the past 10 years -- which included both boom and bust years -- the state's average growth rate in the overall budget would be 3.3 percent. So if we project 3.3 percent increases in the $70.4 billion budget for three years, we'd have a state budget for about $77.6 billion in 2013-14.

Then if we divided $25.08 billion -- the anticipated Medicaid budget for 2013-14 -- by the $77.6 billion figure, we get 32.3 percent. So under either a no-growth or average-growth scenario in the state budget, Medicaid would equal about one-third of the budget by 2013-14.

""When you are trying to look at a budget, it gets pretty speculative when you get out more than three years,'' Baker said. ""The three year plan -- the long-range financial outlook is what we think is a reasonable window for making good projections. ""

Now let's examine what Bondi's campaign sent us.

-- Kirtley sent us the ""Florida Medicaid Modernization Proposal"" from January 2005. It projected the Medicaid cost at 35 percent of the budget in 2009 and 59 percent in 2015. But that was wrong. Even in 2010, Medicaid is still only 28.6 percent of the budget.
-- The campaign sent us the link to the Oct. 7, 2009, House/Senate joint Medicaid estimating conference. That one projected Medicaid spending at about $18.2 billion in 2010-11. That was off also; Medicaid is $20.2 in 2010-11.

Kirtley then sent us to Select Policy Council on Strategic and Economic Planning documents from January 2010. We found three reports in January, but none showed Medicaid eating up half of the state budget by 2015:

-- A document from Jan. 11 stated that the Medicaid budget for 2009-10 was about $17.9 billion and was expected to exceed $19 billion in 2012-13. But it also states that $19 billion figure doesn't take into account Medicaid reform so it's not particularly useful.
-- A document from Jan. 14 didn't contain the word ""Medicaid"" -- it was about energy exploration.
-- A document from Jan. 21 included a chart showing Florida Medicaid within the context of all state appropriations -- 26 percent for 2009-10 and rising to 31 percent in 2014-15.

Bondi's campaign also sent us to Levine, who pushed for Medicaid reform in Florida. He recently stepped down after serving as Louisiana's Secretary of the Department of Health and Hospitals and senior health policy adviser to Gov. Bobby Jindal where he did an analysis of Medicaid projections in that state under federal reform. Levine has since taken a job with Health Management Associates in Naples, a company that operates hospitals, as senior vice president of health development operations and government relations. He formerly served as the head of Broward Health, one of the public hospital districts in South Florida. Most of the hospitals serve Medicaid patients, Levine said.

Levine said he gave money to Holly Benson, one of Bondi's Republican opponents, in the primary but recently met with Bondi for five hours to discuss health care issues (that was weeks after she made her 50 percent claim.) Levine said his only role in Bondi's campaign is to provide policy input at her request. His bottom-line point is that Medicaid costs are growing, so the percentage could rise quickly. Levine says ""it could mean the 50 percent number is even low."" 
But while Levine cites several factors that could cause the cost of Medicaid to skyrocket -- everything from the additional enrollees to the potential of soaring rates for doctors and hospitals to a lawsuit by a pediatric society suing Medicaid arguing they don't get paid enough -- that doesn't prove it will equal 50 percent of the budget. He says Florida should study the impact of such factors and the growth in the rolls on cost in future years.

So, back to Bondi's claim that by 2015, Medicaid will be half the state's budget. It's clear that in Florida, Medicaid expenditures are on the rise, and the federal health care reform will bring additional costs. Bondi's campaign cites a projection from January 2005 but that report is outdated and written long before the economic crash in Florida or federal health care reform. And while Levine mentions several variables that could cause Medicaid costs to skyrocket, many of those are predictions and what-if scenarios. Meanwhile, the state's chief economist cautions against predictions beyond a three-year window. 
The only reasonable projection is that Medicaid expenditures will be around one-third of the state's budget in three years if it keeps growing within the 10-year average. The burden of proof is on Bondi's campaign to back up the 50 percent claim, and the campaign has not done that with current data. All the experts agree it will grow, but there is no current, definitive support for the 50 percent figure. We rate this claim Barely True. ",/factchecks/2010/sep/08/pam-bondi/bondi-says-medicaid-will-eat-half-state-budget-201/

Lindsey Graham endorses Charlie Crist talk spreads quickly on Twitter
","
The Twitter feeds started buzzing shortly after 10 a.m. Sept. 8, 2010 -- Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham had endorsed no-party, independent candidate Charlie Crist in the Senate race in Florida.

""WOW BIG NEWS,"" wrote Twitter user KenGPDX.

BenRay added, ""SCGOP Proxy War in FL. Oh my."" That's a reference to South Carolina's other U.S. senator, Jim DeMint, actively supporting Republican nominee Marco Rubio.

Other conservatives were quick to criticize Graham.

""Respect for Graham plummets to 0,"" KevinWGlass wrote. ""We need to publish the names of the RINO (Republican In Name Only) Republicans who are going along with Obama & Pelosi such as Lindsey Graham,"" wrote ThorntonB1.

Put away the pitchforks, users of Twitter. You've been had.

The bogus rumor was started by Amanda Terkel, a senior political reporter for the Huffington Post. Shortly after 10 a.m. she posted to her Twitter account ""Lindsey Graham endorses Charlie Crist, says he's 'exactly what the national Republican Party needs.' ""

She realized she'd made a mistake within five minutes, but not before her message had been seen and reposted by hundreds of others. She quickly tried to stop the news from spreading, firing off a quick succession of Tweets.

Terkel was looking at an old press release from when Crist was running for Senate as a Republican. The release was sent out on Sept. 8 by Democratic candidate Kendrick Meek's campaign. The Meek campaign has been resending old Crist releases in recent days to highlight his ties to Republicans. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Terkel's follow-up Tweets: 
""Scratch my last tweet. Think I was looking at an old press release. (About Graham/Crist) 
""@FranklinLDavis @DukeStJournal @BenRay @kombiz @kate_sheppard @LEPHAMMER @Chris_Moody

""@KevinWGlass Scratch my last tweet. I was wrong. Looking at old release. 
""@MilesGrant Ignore! I was wrong.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
For the record, we checked with Graham spokesman Kevin Bishop about the endorsement.

""This is an 'old' endorsement, pre-Crist leaving the GOP,"" Bishop said in an e-mail. ""Senator Graham is supporting Rubio.""

Bishop included a helpful timeline explaining Graham's one-time support for Crist.

Congressional candidate Daniel Mielke says almost 30% of federal prisoners are illegal immigrants
","
When it comes to red-meat political issues, few subjects are redder than immigration, with each side playing to emotions with their arguments. The result: Short tempers and, well, some tall tales.

Republican Daniel Mielke, a candidate for the U.S. House seat now held by Dave Obey in Wisconsin’s 7th District, entered the fray with a claim he posted on his campaign website that points to the impact of illegal immigrants on federal prisons.

The statement: ""Close to 30% of our federal prison population consists of  illegal immigrants. We cannot continue to incarcerate criminals from other countries at the taxpayer’s expense. We  must stop the tide of criminal importation. This alone would cut our prison costs by almost a third.""

It costs about $6.2 billion a year to run the federal prison system, so that sounds like a pretty huge savings if it’s true.

We decided to find out if it is.

We started with cut-costs-by-one-third aspect of the statement.

Even if the inmate population suddenly dropped, many fixed costs would remain -- electricity, staffing, maintenance. There would be savings, of course, but not necessarily at a one-to-one rate. When asked about his claim of cutting prison costs by a third, Mielke backed off.

Within a few days he added this qualifier to his website:

""Note: figures above are based on a cost per prisoner average.  Actual cost could vary, individually, depending on the circumstances such as health of individual, behavior of prisoner etc.  Also there is a set cost that would exist even if our prisons were empty.""

But what about Mielke’s main point -- that nearly 30 percent of the federal inmates should never have been in the country in the first place?

As his source, Mielke cites Lou Dobbs, the former CNN pundit known for his outspoken and passionate views on immigration. More precisely, we found, it was a reporter on the show Dobbs used to host.

On the April 1, 2006 broadcast of ""Lou Dobbs Tonight,"" CNN reporter Christine Romans said: ""According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, 30 percent of federal prisoners are not U.S. citizens.""

She went on to say, without attributing a source: ""Most are thought to be illegal aliens.""

That statement has been bouncing around the Internet ever since.

We went to the Federal  Bureau of Prisons to see if the reporter and, therefore, candidate Mielke were on target.

The bureau’s website says that 73.4 percent of the federal inmates are U.S. citizens,  and that more than 26 percent are not citizens. That’s just over a quarter of the inmates, within spitting distance to the nearly one-third claimed by Mielke.

But there’s a catch here -- and it's a big one.

Non-citizen doesn’t necessarily mean illegal immigrant, as many people receive visas or green cards to live and work in America. Presumably, some of these legal immigrants chose crime as their vocation. And the agency itself does not categorize inmates as legal citizens or illegal citizens.

""Can we make that leap that if they’re of a different nationality  they are illegal immigrants?"" spokeswoman Felicia Ponce said in an interview. ""No.""

Despite that, Mielke says the one-third figure remains correct, arguing legal aliens lose their right to visas or green cards as soon as they get convicted.   

Once again, he’s in the ballpark. Just not the right seat.

The process of revoking green cards generally does not begin until after the convict completes his prison sentence, said attorney Grant Sovern, who heads the immigration practice at the law firm of Quarles & Brady and teaches immigration law at the University of Wisconsin Law School. Until that time the person is here legally, he said.

""If it’s a felony, the visa is not revoked immediately, but you are deportable,"" Sovern said, adding the same is true if the person has a green card, or permanent residence status.

When the person completes his prison term, immigration officials decide whether to begin deportation proceedings, he said. In most cases, he said, they will seek to deport.

Gail Montenegro, a spokeswoman in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Chicago office, agreed, though she noted that immigrants on visas -- such as a work or student visa -- could be considered ""out-of-status"" when convicted of a crime. That means ""the person is deportable and could be placed into deportation proceedings by ICE.""

Mielke’s statement, however, didn’t leave room for legal immigrants who end up committing crimes, but said the percentage applied to immigrants who come here illegally and commit them. He described it as stopping the tide of ""criminal importation.""

So, in his statement did Mielke cross the border between fact  and fiction?

He took what was an easy-to-verify fact  -- the number of non-citizens who are guests of  Uncle Sam in the federal prison system -- to make a political point. But instead of going to the source, he relied on an unattributed comment on a political talk show. In doing so, he missed the correct figure by a little and missed some key nuances by a lot. We rate his comment False.",/factchecks/2010/sep/08/daniel-mielke/congressional-candidate-daniel-mielke-says-almost-/

Deal's tax returns fuzzy on details, Barnes camp says
","
In recent weeks, Roy Barnes, the Democratic nominee for governor, has been goading GOP rival Nathan Deal to release his income tax returns.

On Thursday, Deal put tax returns dating to 1981 on his campaign website. The returns include the federal 1040 form and the Georgia form 500, which outlines how much Deal, who resigned his seat in Congress earlier this year, paid to the state. The 2009 information contained six pages of information. Barnes, an attorney and former governor, released 141 pages of 2009 tax information.

""By releasing only the cover pages of his returns -- Rep. Deal is hiding more than he's disclosed,"" Barnes campaign spokesman Emil Runge said in a statement the following day.

Is Deal concealing more than he's making public?

Bickering over income taxes is a time-honored political tradition. The Barnes camp is trying to score points on the issue primarily because of a controversial business arrangement of Deal's that has attracted much scrutiny. (No one has demanded Libertarian Party candidate John Monds' returns.) Barnes' website has a link to another site accusing Deal of trying to hide information about his income taxes.

""The Barnes campaign is trying to find a chink in the armor and trying to expose it,"" said Bill Bozarth, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, a nonprofit government watchdog organization.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported last year that Deal and his business partner had a no-bid agreement with the state government to provide space for inspections of rebuilt vehicles and personally intervened with state officials to fight proposed changes to the operation. Deal resigned from his congressional job in March, scuttling an ethics investigation into the agreement. The AJC reported in July that a federal grand jury subpoenaed state Revenue Commissioner Bart Graham about a meeting he had with Deal about the agreement.

Deal has said he has done nothing improper. He says he is not the target of a federal investigation. His spokesman, Brian Robinson, said the 1040 forms and financial disclosures to the State Ethics Commission and to Congress give the candidate's complete financial picture.

""It shows how much he made and how much he paid in taxes,"" Robinson said.

Deal's 2009 federal income form reports the candidate and his wife, Sandra, earned $153,753 in wages and salaries. Deal reported earning $29,024 in partnerships from his business interests. The couple's adjusted gross income, which includes pension, Social Security and other benefits, totaled $229,123.

Deal has a handful of business interests that stem from his auto salvage business based in Gainesville. Business owners typically file a Schedule E form, which outlines income or losses from business partnerships, rental real estate, royalties, estates and trusts. Deal did not include that form on his campaign website. Some financial planners and accountants say that information would help.

""The story is partially told on the first three pages [of Deal's return],"" said Mitch Reiner, a certified financial planner who is chief operating officer of Capital Investment Advisors, based in Sandy Springs. ""If I was advising a business owner, I would need more of their tax return to have a real clear picture.""

Roger Lusby III, an Alpharetta-based certified public accountant, said the Schedule E information is already included on line 17 of Deal's federal income tax form, which totaled $29,024. He doubted Deal's business partners would allow him to put the Schedule E form on his campaign website.

""One certainly has the gist of what his income and his losses were derived from,"" said Lusby, managing partner of Frazier & Deeter, which describes itself as the second-largest independent CPA and advisory firm in Georgia.

Deal campaign officials said they did not include the Schedule E form because they felt comfortable that the candidate's federal disclosure forms from his 18 years as a congressman, combined with this year's state disclosure form and his income tax form contained as much information as what is on the Schedule E.

Scott Winkler, a certified financial planner and certified public accountant who owns his own firm, looked at several years worth of Deal's tax returns and Barnes' 2009 return for AJC PolitiFact Georgia. Winkler said he saw ""nothing unusual"" on either candidate's 2009 returns. Barnes, whose total income was about $5.1 million, did include a Schedule E form for his 2009 return on his campaign website. Most of it contains repairs and remodeling to his rental properties. There's also some information regarding four businesses in which Barnes lists himself as a partner. Barnes reported earning $24,296 from those businesses. The information includes some data about gains and losses from those companies. It does not show what percentage of ownership Barnes has in each company.

Winkler said the Schedule E form from Deal's return would not say much, aside from how much money was earned or lost.

""More detailed information isn't going to do a whole lot,"" Winkler said.

Schedule E forms could contain supplemental documents further explaining the loss or gain from a particular investment.

The Barnes camp wants Deal to release all of his schedule forms, which include capital gains and losses and alternative minimum taxes. They noted that Deal's 2008 tax returns show he was paid $75,000 from his auto salvage business, but a congressional cap limits outside income to $25,830. The Deal campaign said the $75,000 was mistakenly reported as wages when it was a dividend. Runge also noted that Deal reported earning slightly more money on his state disclosure form than on his 2009 income taxes.

""The taxes he did release just raise more questions than they answer,"" Runge said in an e-mail.

It's clear that Barnes provided more information from his tax returns than Deal. ""[Barnes] has pretty much shown everything,"" Winkler said. However, much of Barnes' supplemental information involves his rental properties. The CPAs we spoke with said Deal's 2009 Schedule E form would include some more data about his business interests, but the grand totals are already on his 1040 form. Therefore, we believe to say Deal ""is hiding more than he disclosed"" is a nuanced proclamation. We rate the statement about Deal as Half True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/08/emil-runge/deals-tax-returns-fuzzy-details-barnes-camp-says/

Do presidents always get ""shellacked"" in midterm elections?
","As Democrats brace for expected losses in the House and Senate, you can expect to hear a lot more of this in the weeks ahead: The president's party usually takes a beating in midterm elections.

So when we heard Mary Jordan, a longtime foreign correspondent for the Washington Post, mention this pattern during the roundtable segment of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, we decided to check the history.

Jordan said, ""Well, the fact that the Republicans are going to do so well, really, it's just the history. The president's party always gets shellacked in midterms. It's only twice, 1934 and 2002, that the president's party actually gained in both the House and the Senate.""

She's correct that the president's party generally loses ground in midterm elections. In midterms since 1862, the president's party has averaged losses of about 32 seats in the House and more than two seats in the Senate.

She's also right that the president's party beat the odds and gained in 1934 and 2002. In 1934 -- two years into Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency, in the midst of the Great Depression -- Roosevelt's Democratic Party gained nine House seats and 10 Senate seats. And in 2002, roughly a year after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, President George W. Bush's Republican Party gained eight House seats and two Senate seats.

But the president's party also avoided getting ""shellacked"" on other occasions.

We won't dig back as far as the Lincoln Administration, but in 1962, President John F. Kennedy's Democrats lost just four seats in the House and gained three seats in the Senate. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush's Republicans lost eight seats in the House and only one seat in the Senate -- a setback, but not a shellacking. And in 1998, President Bill Clinton gained five seats in the House and stayed even in the Senate.

None of these fit the strict definition of the president's party gaining seats in both chambers during a midterm election -- the yardstick Jordan specifically used -- but we do think they undermine her claim that presidents ""always"" get ""shellacked"" in midterms.

The 1998 election under Clinton is especially notable, since elections six years after a president takes office tend to produce especially harsh results for the party occupying the White House. In fact, the 1998 election -- when voters were widely believed to be punishing a Republican overreach in their impeachment of Clinton -- represents the only time since the Civil War that a president has survived a sixth-year election with anything close to gains in both chambers.

A final note for political history buffs. We initially thought we'd have to add 1902 to 1934 and 2002 as a year in which the president gained seats in both chambers. On Election Day 1902, Theodore Roosevelt's Republicans gained two seats in the Senate and seven in the House -- but we found the Democrats also gained seats in the House, 25 to be precise. How was that possible? It was because Congress had enlarged the House to account for population growth, from 357 seats before the election to 386 seats after. (The House didn't reach its current 435 seats until 1913.) So because of this oddity, we'll leave 1902 out.

In all, then, Jordan is on target by singling out 1934 and 2002 as the only years in which a president's party gained seats in both chambers during a midterm election. But she stretched a bit when she said that ""the president's party always gets shellacked in midterms."" If she'd said ""usually gets shellacked,"" she would have been on safe ground, but the examples of 1962, 1990 and 1998 demonstrate that an incumbent president can in fact lose ground in Congress without being ""shellacked."" On balance, we rate Jordan's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/07/mary-jordan/do-presidents-always-get-shellacked-midterm-electi/

How similar were the recessions under Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama?
","As Democrats grapple with the stagnant economy and President Barack Obama's crumbling approval ratings, expect to hear this comparison a lot: Barack Obama in 2010 = Ronald Reagan in 1982. On the surface, the comparison is compelling. Reagan and Obama succeeded unpopular incumbents and rode a wave of goodwill into office. During their first two years, both presidents faced brutal recessions, and their approval ratings took big hits. Reagan's Republican Party ended up losing 26 House seats in the 1982 midterm elections (increasing the Democrats' majority). Yet only two years later, after the economy had regained its footing, Reagan won a landslide re-election victory.

Naturally, Obama partisans hope the same will happen in 2012.

So when we heard Mary Jordan, a longtime foreign correspondent with the Washington Post, use this analogy during the roundtable segment of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, we decided it was time for a fact-check.

Jordan said, ""And remember, folks, that 1982, when Reagan just started out, it was exactly the same point. He was two years into his term. The unemployment was well over 10 percent, and it did come out of it.""

We can't yet say how Democrats will fare in November compared with how Republicans did in 1982 and in this item we're only examining unemployment. So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that calculates the unemployment rate.

In August 1982, two months before the midterm elections, the unemployment rate stood at 9.8 percent. In August 2010, it was 9.6 percent. So the numbers are remarkably similar. Even the comparative rise during each president's term was similar. The unemployment rate rose 2.5 points between Reagan's election and the last unemployment survey before the midterm election, compared with 3 points for Obama.

Case closed? Not really.

For one thing, in 1982, the unemployment rate only rose to ""well over 10 percent,"" to use Jordan's words, in October 1982, when it hit 10.4 percent. However, this number was released after Election Day, meaning that it could not have been a factor on voters' minds. It peaked at 10.8 percent in November and December 1982.

So while Jordan's number is not far off, it does modestly exaggerate how high voters knew unemployment to be as they prepared to vote.

Here's another difference -- the average unemployed worker this year has been jobless much longer than in 1982. In August 1982, the median length of unemployment was 8.7 weeks. In August 2010, it was 19.9 weeks -- more than twice as long. And that's not a blip. For nearly a year, the median duration of unemployment has ranged between 19 and 25.5 weeks. So Jordan is right that there are some similarities between the recessions of 1982 and 2010. But she glosses over the fact that unemployment didn't go ""well over 10 percent"" in 1982 until after the election, and her use of the overall unemployment rate overlooks an important factor -- that workers this year are likely to have been without jobs much longer. On balance, we rate Jordan's comment Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/07/mary-jordan/how-similar-were-recessions-under-ronald-reagan-ba/

Ohio Treasurer Kevin Boyce takes credit for creating and saving tens of thousands of jobs
","
Spend any time with an Ohio politician running for office this year and you’ll hear one common theme: Jobs.

The hard-working people of Ohio deserve jobs, they all say.

Ohio Treasurer Kevin Boyce is no different. On many of the platforms available to him — his state website, his campaign literature, a YouTube video, Twitter — Boyce is talking about the jobs his office has supported.

""Our most important work has been creating and retaining almost 55,000 Ohio jobs,"" he told supporters in an Aug. 19 e-mail.

In a YouTube video his office released July 14 touting the treasurer’s accomplishments, he credited treasury programs like GrowNOW and the Ohio Enterprise Bond Fund.

In recent weeks, the message has evolved, with Boyce or his supporters saying the treasury has ""helped create and retain almost 60,000 Ohio jobs.""

That seemed like a lot of jobs for the state’s top banker to take credit for. The Ohio Treasurer, who is responsible for safeguarding and investing the state’s money, isn’t well-known for job creation and retention. So we asked Boyce’s office for evidence.

Although Boyce referenced two treasury programs in the video, most of the jobs he is taking credit for actually are related to programs at other state agencies, such as the Department of Development. These programs involve infrastructure projects, small business loans and other initiatives that put people to work.

In most cases, Boyce’s office simply helps fund the programs by issuing bonds. His office structures the debt, sells the bonds and hands the money over to the agencies administering the programs. It is Boyce’s duty as treasurer, according to state law, to issue bonds for these agencies. He does not play a direct role in actually spending the money in ways that create and retain jobs.

He plays a more integral role, however, in the treasury programs he noted in the video, which account for 14,382 jobs.

Boyce, a Democrat, is running to keep his job this November against state Rep. Josh Mandel, a Republican from Lyndhurst.

Overall, Boyce’s office has carried out 21 bond issues totalling nearly $750 million since he took office in January 2009. Boyce updated the economic impact of the bond issues -- claiming 59,943 jobs created and retained -- in an Aug. 27 press release that included more recent statistics from the state agencies.

Here’s how he added it up:

Boyce counted both direct and indirect employment. Direct employment reflects actual jobs. Indirect employment is a projection based on the size of a given project or initiative. Take, for example, a highway renovation project that requires 50 construction workers. Those would be direct jobs. But the economic impact of hiring those workers is measured in indirect jobs — people employed by suppliers who provide materials to fix the highway, and people whose jobs are supported by consumer expenditures from wages paid on the highway project.

Indirect jobs accounted for more than half of the jobs Boyce said he helped create and retain. Many of the indirect job numbers were estimates from small businesses seeking loans from the state’s Department of Development. A department spokeswoman said she was unsure how those businesses calculated the figures.

Boyce defended his inclusion of indirect jobs in the Aug. 27 press release, which was distributed days after we began asking questions about his jobs claim.

""Indirect job creation is just as valuable as direct,"" Boyce said in the press release. ""This allows us to affect change in several industries and represents just how interrelated jobs sectors really are.  A project that employs construction workers boosts both manufacturing and the retail of a local economy.""

The direct employment figures used in Boyce’s claim also carry inexactitudes. Let’s look at jobs traced back to $385 million in bonds the treasurer issued for the Ohio Department of Transportation, which used the money for infrastructure projects.

ODOT told Boyce’s office those projects will result in 10,703 jobs, based on a mathematical formula that says $1 billion in infrastructure spending results in 27,800 jobs. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration last updated the formula in 2007.

But the resulting number of jobs is merely an estimation that carries a list of qualifiers and caveats.

First off, each of the 10,703 jobs is actually a ""person-year."" Here’s how the Federal Highway Administration explains the term: ""One hundred person-years may translate into 50 jobs supported for two years or 100 jobs supported for one year."" So the 10,703 jobs associated with ODOT’s money can only be expected to be kept for one year.

Furthermore, the federal formula notes that two-thirds of the jobs are indirect jobs. Other state agencies for which Boyce issued bonds, such as the Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the Ohio Department of Mental Health, also used job projection formulas to estimate job creation and retention.

ODOT spokesman Scott Varner said it is appropriate to include indirect jobs in an analysis of infrastructure investment. ""That gives a better picture of the true return on investment,"" Varner said.

""It is an estimation. That’s a number that will always be difficult to capture,"" Varner added. ""It tries to give the best picture possible.""

Such a reliance on indirect employment, however, doesn’t paint an accurate picture for voters, said Zach Schiller, research director for Policy Matters Ohio, a liberal leaning, nonpartisan organization that focuses on economic policy. ""From a perception standpoint, it’s not what people think it is,"" Schiller said.

Government offices, however, use this type of math often to promote job creation and retention. Supporters of the Ohio Third Frontier initiative, which voters extended this May, included indirect employment when they proclaimed the program has created 48,000 jobs.

""I would tend to be skeptical of job creation figures in general,"" Schiller said.

When Ohio voters, some of whom are out of work, hear a candidate like Boyce take credit for bringing in new jobs and keeping existing jobs in their state, we doubt the concepts of indirect jobs and ""person-years"" enter their mind. His calculations give voters the wrong impression.

Further, the significance of Boyce’s role in many of the job-creating state programs is questionable. While the bonds his office sells help fund the program, Boyce has no say in how those programs are run. He is more of a rubber stamp.

We find significant exaggerations and mistakes in Boyce’s statement.
  

In addition, Boyce’s statement in the YouTube video is not accurate; the time frame is incorrect. He meant to frame his accomplishment from January 2009 to the present, not ""in the past year."" The evidence his office provided to support his claim dates back to January 2009, when he took office. Boyce’s campaign literature and Twitter feed also reference the longer time frame.

Mark Neumann says he doesn't receive support from special interest groups
","
In his bid for governor, businessman Mark Neumann badly lags behind rival Republican Scott Walker in fundraising -- that is, if you don’t count the $2.7 million Neumann has lent his own campaign.

In most scenarios, that would be considered a negative. But this is politics.

In a recent radio spot, Neumann put a positive spin on the fundraising picture.

""I didn't run for office for power,"" the ad says. ""I ran because I'm afraid of what's happening in America. That experience taught me how dangerous a permanent class of career politicians can be...""

The ad continues: ""I've owned a business for 26 years. My family isn't in politics and my supporters aren't special interest groups in Madison and Milwaukee. Now's our chance. This is the election. Let's choose a governor who will fight for Wisconsin's forgotten middle class.""

We were struck by part of that statement. Is Mark Neumann free of big-city special interest group backing?

We’ll define special interests broadly: cash support from political action committees (PACs) and  ""bundled"" donations from ""conduit"" organizations. Bundling is when a corporation, trade group or political party collects individual donations, pools them and writes one big check in the group’s name to the candidate.

In 1992, when Neumann first ran for Congress, he denounced PAC contributions. But he accepted them in subsequent races. He served two terms in the late 1990s, representing a district in southern Wisconsin.

This time around, in the gubernatorial race, campaign spokesman Chris Lato said Neumann has not ""actively pursued"" PAC contributions. But the campaign isn’t  turning such money away.

Lato noted that in Neumann’s latest six-month finance report, covering the first half of 2010, there were no contributions from PACs. In that period, groups and corporations bundled less than $4,000 in donations from their members or employees for Neumann.

If you go back a year -- to the time the campaign began -- the same pattern holds, according to campaign reports filed with the state Government Accountability Board.

PAC cash:
Neumann in 12 months reported getting not one single cash donation from a PAC, according to a PolitiFact Wisconsin review of state records. (The Wisconsin Dental Association PAC wrote him a $1,000 check, according to that group’s report. But PolitiFact Wisconsin couldn’t find a record of it in Neumann’s report. The campaign erred, Lato said.).

Neumann’s statement in the radio ad aims to contrast him with the other two major candidates in the race, Republican Walker and Democrat Tom Barrett. And his rivals clearly have received more from political action committees -- typically labor unions and business interests.

Reports show Walker received $190,000 from political action committees in the same 12-month period that Neumann got nothing or close to it. Barrett received far more, almost $500,000.

Those are the PAC facts.

Conduit cash:
Now let's look at those ""bundled"" conduit donations.

Neumann, a developer and homebuilder, has received some conduit money from Madison or Milwaukee-based groups.

Neumann’s statewide conduit tally was $12,925 from 78 individual gifts bundled by a small number of conduits. Most of it came from Milwaukee and Madison and just three groups: Wisconsin builders, engineering companies and Realtors, according to our analysis of state records.

Walker, meanwhile, took in $311,000 from 1,300 individual gifts bundled by conduits. PolitiFact’s analysis found. His conduit backers included health care companies, utilities, Realtors, law firms, a timber company, grocers, credit unions, chiropractors and builders.

And Barrett was between the two: $214,000 from conduits.

All Cash:
This brings us to the final tally from PACs and conduits.

Overall, Neumann has received 0.5 percent of his overall war chest from PACs and conduits, compared with 11.5 percent for Walker. Barrett’s campaign topped both Republicans, getting 22 percent from the special interest donations in the year.

So, let’s look at the bottom line.

Neumann’s statement says his supporters ""aren’t special interest groups in Milwaukee and Madison."" When it comes to measuring that support in dollars, Neumann has received some cash from such groups -- but so little it’s negligible, and his major opponents received far more. He may have wanted more himself, but it did not come his way. Thus, we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/07/mark-neumann/mark-neumann-says-he-doesnt-receive-support-specia/

Ted Cruz says 'a strong bipartisan majority' in the House of Representatives 'voted to defund Obamacare'
","Where the showdown over a government shutdown is concerned, the blame game runs both ways. Congress and the White House are at loggerheads over what to do with President Barack Obama’s health care law. Major aspects of the law are set to go live on Oct. 1, the same day as funding for the federal government runs out. But efforts to keep the funding flowing have floundered on the demand of some Republicans to defund or delay the law, while the president has refused to eliminate or pare back his signature legislative achievement. We noticed two similar, but opposite, claims about how the parties broke on key votes in the conflict. Here, we will look at a claim by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. In a separate fact-check, we will look at a claim by Obama. After passage of a measure on Sept. 20, 2013, to fund the government without funding Obamacare, Cruz -- a leader of the pro-defunding side -- released a statement that said in part, ""Today, the House of Representatives did what Washington pundits only a few weeks ago said was impossible: a strong bipartisan majority voted to defund Obamacare. This is a victory for House conservatives, and it is a victory for Speaker (John) Boehner and Republican leadership."" Was it accurate for Cruz to say that ""a strong bipartisan majority"" in the House of Representatives ""voted to defund Obamacare""? We didn’t hear back from Cruz’s office, but we looked at the vote tallies ourselves. On the final vote, the measure -- which paired continued funding for the government with a defunding of Obamacare -- passed by a 230-189 margin. But those 230 votes in favor broke down to 228 Republicans and just two Democrats, Reps. Mike McIntyre of North Carolina and Jim Matheson of Utah. (One Republican, Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia, broke ranks and joined the Democrats.) We have addressed claims of ""bipartisanship"" in the past and have generally been skeptical of a claim where a tiny fraction of a caucus serves as justification for the ""bipartisan"" label. Norm Ornstein, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told us in 2011 that his definition would be ""healthy numbers, not necessarily majorities, and not necessarily equally drawn, from both parties"" -- a threshold hardly met in this case. Several other experts we checked with for this fact-check agreed. ""I think a reasonable person would expect the threshold to be higher, particularly if the modifier ‘strong’ is applied,"" as Cruz included in his statement, said Roy T. Meyers, a political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County. Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee, felt similarly. ""Two Democrats, like two swallows, do not a bipartisan summer make,"" Wolfensberger said. ""It's more like a false spring. Beauty and political truth are in the eye of the beholder. We all tend to see what we want to see."" Our ruling Cruz said that ""a strong bipartisan majority"" in the House of Representatives ""voted to defund Obamacare."" Even if you consider the overall 230-189 margin to be a ""strong"" victory for backers of the measure, it doesn’t qualify as ""bipartisan"" except in the most hyper-technical sense. Two Democrats out of the 190 who voted -- barely more than 1 percent of the party’s caucus -- joined Republicans in voting for the bill. In our book, that doesn’t qualify as much of a bipartisan action. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2013/sep/30/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-strong-bipartisan-majority-house-rep/

Barack Obama says ""Democrats and Republicans"" in the Senate ""acted responsibly by voting to keep our government open”
","As the United States government hurtles toward a shutdown, the blame game is well under way. Congress and the White House are at loggerheads over what to do with President Barack Obama’s health care law. Major aspects of the law are set to go live on Oct. 1, the same day as funding for the federal government runs out. But efforts to keep the funding flowing have floundered on the demand of some Republicans to defund or delay the law. The president, for his part, has refused to eliminate or pare back his signature legislative achievement. We noticed two similar, but opposite, claims about how the parties broke on key votes in the conflict. Here, we will look at a claim by Obama. In a separate fact-check, we’ll look at one by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Obama’s comment on Sept. 27, 2013, came shortly after the Senate passed a bill to keep federal funding flowing but without a provision that would defund Obama’s law. ""If Congress chooses not to pass a budget by Monday — the end of the fiscal year — they will shut down the government, along with many vital services that the American people depend on,"" Obama said in an appearance before reporters in the White House. ""The good news is, within the past couple of hours, the United States Senate — Democrats and Republicans — acted responsibly by voting to keep our government open and delivering the services the American people expect."" Was it accurate to say that ""The United States Senate — Democrats and Republicans — acted responsibly by voting to keep our government open""? As Politico noted shortly after Obama made the claim, Obama is incorrect, at least by the most literal reading. The final measure passed by a 54-42 margin, with two Republicans not voting. All 54 who voted for the measure were either Democrats or independents who caucus with the Democrats. All 42 who voted against the measure were Republicans. Not a single member of the Senate crossed party lines on that vote. When we asked the White House to explain, a spokesman pointed not to the final vote but rather to the preliminary vote to proceed to debate, known as a ""cloture vote."" Being able to proceed to a final vote requires reaching a 60-vote threshold, assuming all senators are present and voting. In this case, the cloture vote did indeed pass by a 79-19 margin, with two senators not voting. Of the 79 votes in favor of cloture, 25 came from Republicans -- a strong showing in these polarized days. ""I'd refer you to the comments of Senate Republicans on the Senate floor on Thursday and Friday who voted for cloture, saying that they opposed Obamacare but that they didn't believe they should shut down the government over it,"" said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. ""So, they voted to keep it open. That was a strong bipartisan vote."" The White House has a point that not every Republican who voted against the ""clean"" continuing resolution on final passage -- that is, on the version that was stripped of the language to defund Obamacare -- did so to protest the removal of the defunding language. To the contrary, the proposal, advanced by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and others, deeply split the Republican Party over legislative tactics. However, Obama went too far when he said the ""Senate — Democrats and Republicans — acted responsibly by voting to keep our government open."" He didn’t say that Democrats and Republicans alike preferred to avoid a shutdown, a claim that would be largely accurate. He specifically said members of both parties voted to advance that goal. The problem, veterans of congressional procedure say, is that the significant Republican support for cloture should be seen as a way to move the process along, so that all options can be exhausted, not as an expression that they support the underlying bill. Only Democrats, not Republicans, voted in a way that supported the final version of the bill. ""The cloture vote is a vote to end debate, and not on the substance of the matter you are voting to end debate on,"" said Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee. The fact that so many Republicans supported ending debate, he said, suggests they ""wanted to advance the ball to expedite the ping-pong match of negotiations over various options before the fiscal new year's ball hit the ground."" Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, added that he sees ""a kernel of truth"" in the statement, but one ""surrounded by a lot of fleshy falsehood."" Our ruling Obama said, ""The United States Senate — Democrats and Republicans — acted responsibly by voting to keep our government open."" The president has a point that 25 Republicans backed a procedural motion to proceed to the bill itself. But experts said that when analyzing Obama’s comment, it’s more important to note that not a single Republican ultimately voted ""to keep our government open"" when the chamber took up the bill itself.

"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Bill Nelson']","
Bill Nelson says navigators are nothing new
","Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., has a message for Republican Gov. Rick Scott who doesn’t want Obamacare ""navigators"" spreading the word about the health care law: Relax. We’ve had similar folks helping Floridians navigate health care programs for many years. Scott has sought to ban Obamacare navigators from county health departments and has faced some blowback: Broward and Pinellas counties have refused to comply and Miami-Dade may follow their lead. Nelson portrayed Scott as a hypocrite because he said there are already similar navigators who help Floridians with questions about health insurance. ""State officials have so far failed to mention that these ‘consumer helpers’ have been serving the people of Florida in various ways for years -- and, yes, even with the current governor's full backing,"" Nelson wrote in a Tampa Bay Times op-ed Sept. 19. ""In fact, many state and federal agencies have such ‘navigators’ involved in helping folks maneuver through the often complex processes associated with filing benefits claims, for example -- even buying health insurance. That’s right: even when buying health insurance created by the state. From Medicaid to Medicare, from veterans' organizations to the state's own KidCare insurance program, navigators are available to make sure Floridians get assistance."" Are there already similar navigators who help the public access health insurance and other services? We went in search of the examples cited by Nelson. Obamacare navigators First, some background on Obamacare navigators. The Affordable Care Act awarded $8 million in federal grants to eight Florida entities to hire navigators, including the University of South Florida-based program Florida Covering Kids & Families and Pinellas County. Florida state leaders declined to set up their own marketplace or work with the federal government to run it together, leaving the job to the federal government. Navigators must go through at least 20 hours of training and be fingerprinted before they can become certified. Their job is to offer impartial information about health plans and the availability of tax credits and subsidies to offset the cost of a plan. They are not allowed to direct consumers to specific plans or receive payments from insurers, businesses or consumers. Navigators will begin enrolling people within days as the insurance marketplaces known as exchanges launch Oct. 1. Medicare/Medicaid counselors In our search for something similar to Obamacare navigators, we started with Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for seniors, and Medicaid, which serves the poor. ""The navigator program is similar to Medicare counselors, which have existed for years and never faced this kind of bullying from Florida,"" said U.S. Health and Human Services Department spokesman Fabien Levy. States receive federal grants to hire people that help Medicare beneficiaries enroll for coverage, and this year Florida received about $3 million. The Florida version of the program is called SHINE (Serving Health Insurance Needs of Elders) and is overseen by the Florida Department of Elder Affairs, which contracts with local Area Agency on Aging groups. Florida has 463 SHINE volunteers. SHINE volunteers aren’t involved in Obamacare and aren’t called navigators, said Ashley Marshall, spokeswoman for the state Department of Elder Affairs. But they fulfill a similar role in that they help guide Floridians who need insurance. SHINE volunteers assist seniors primarily with questions about Medicare, and sometimes Medicaid if a client qualifies for both. Outreach efforts include a helpline and spreading the word at community events. ""What we provide is free unbiased information,"" said Charles Franckle, SHINE coordinator for Pinellas County. ""When people are approaching Medicare they might contact us to ask us should they sign up for Part A and B and how do they do it."" SHINE volunteers don’t endorse a particular plan. But they can answer questions about the differences between the various Medicare options by teaching the callers how to use the Medicare.gov website or doing it for them and sending them the results. Paid employees provide Medicaid counseling through the state Agency for Health Care Administration or contracted vendors. The counselors assist recipients via phone, in writing or in person and conduct community outreach and education. Florida KidCare insurance Florida’s KidCare health insurance program for poor children includes outreach to help families sign up for care. An outreach calendar for September showed various community events statewide where families could learn more about KidCare, such as at Pasco County’s Kids Health and Safety Day. In fact, KidCare even uses the term ""navigators."" A Nelson spokesman pointed to a 2012 sample contract that stated the Florida Healthy Kids Corp. was seeking grant proposals from ""eligible organizations to become Regional Navigators and assist eligible families in applying for or retaining Florida KidCare."" Three entities signed that contract: Health Council of Southeast Florida, Broward County Health Department and United Way of Marion County, according to the Florida Healthy Kids Corp. Legislative appropriations earmarked for Florida KidCare outreach were eliminated in July 2003, said Christie Goss, spokeswoman for Florida Healthy Kids Corp., a KidCare partner. But community groups statewide continue to promote KidCare and help the public enroll. Florida Healthy Kids provides some grants for KidCare promotion -- about $900,000 since 2011-12. The University of South Florida’s Covering Kids and Families, which received an Obamacare navigator grant, has been doing outreach for enrollment for KidCare and Medicaid since 1999 with state, federal and foundation grants. ""We work with schools, churches, hospitals, businesses, etc.,"" said program director Jodi Ray. ""We conduct our outreach and education activities wherever we have the best chance to reach people who need this information. We also have a military outreach project that specifically focuses on making sure that both active duty and veteran families get the information they need about getting their kids covered. The enrollment assistance is an important component of the outreach efforts."" The particular requirements and training for Obamacare navigators and those who assist Floridians with KidCare or Medicaid can vary. However, ""it’s very similar in that we are helping people apply for health coverage,"" Ray said. ""We are not collecting medical health information -- we are simply helping them understand how to navigate the process without getting overwhelmed or confused and be able to answer questions so they can make decisions they need to make."" Veterans The Florida Department of Veterans Affairs provides benefits counseling related to state and federal veterans’ programs. The department has paid claims examiners who work out of VA medical centers, clinics and nursing homes and provide benefits counseling to help connect Floridians to benefits such as disability payments and pensions. The counselors don’t enroll veterans in health care but do point them in the right direction. Scott’s response We sent Nelson’s claim and a summary of our findings of positions similar to Obamacare navigators to Scott’s office and received a short reply: ""How many of those ‘navigators’ use the federal data hub?"" said spokeswoman Melissa Sellers in an email. But spokespersons for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told us that navigators can’t access the ""hub"", which provides a way to transmit data between state and federal systems to verify consumer application information. ""Navigators won’t be tied into the federal data hub. They will enroll people through the online interface that all consumers have access to at healthcare.gov,"" said Brian Cook, a CMS spokesman. We heard other comments from state agency spokespersons about differences in the training or requirements for Obamacare navigators compared to other types of benefits counselors. But Nelson didn’t make a claim about background checks or other requirements. Our ruling Seeking to assuage concerns about Obamacare navigators, Nelson said, ""Many state and federal agencies have such ‘navigators’ involved in helping folks maneuver through the often complex processes associated with filing benefits claims, for example - even buying health insurance."" Let’s review our findings: There are differences in terms of some of the requirements and training to become an Obamacare navigator versus those who provide assistance for some of these other programs. However Nelson didn’t say they are identical: He said that we already have such ‘navigators’ to help Floridians access services.

"['New Jersey', 'Congress', 'Elections', 'Steve Lonegan']","
Steve Lonegan claims he could be the first Republican elected in New Jersey to the Senate in four decades
","Steve Lonegan is well aware of the potential to make history in the Oct. 16 special election for a U.S. Senate seat. If elected, the Republican would be the first senator from his party to be elected to the upper house of Congress in at least two generations, Lonegan noted during a radio interview Monday on the John Gambling show, during which he discussed his campaign. ""I would be the first Republican senator elected in New Jersey in 41 years,"" said Lonegan, who is vying with Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a Democrat, for the seat left vacant after Sen. Frank Lautenberg died in early June. Lonegan is correct. Other than an eight-month period in 1982 when a Republican was appointed to a Senate seat from New Jersey, and this summer's appointment of Republican Jeff Chiesa to temporarily fill Lautenberg's seat until the special election, Democrats have had a stronghold on the state’s two Senate seats for more than 30 years. This statistic is not a new claim. Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, referenced it in May 2012 during a speech he gave at an event held by the libertarian Cato Institute. Let’s first review some history about New Jersey’s senators. Clifford P. Case was the last Republican that New Jerseyans elected to the Senate, in 1972. Case served four terms before losing a re-election bid in the 1978 Republican primary to Jeffrey Bell. The Democratic lock on New Jersey’s Senate seats began in 1978 with the election of Bill Bradley. Republicans from the Garden State had served in the Senate for the 40 years leading up to Bradley’s election, but Democrats have dominated every Senate race since Bradley’s election. That changed briefly in 1982, when Republican Nicholas Brady was appointed to fill in for Democrat Harrison Williams Jr., who left office after convictions on bribery and conspiracy charges as part of the federal ABSCAM probe. ABSCAM was an investigation by the FBI in which several public officials were offered money or other items in exchange for special favors. Brady left the Senate after Lautenberg won the 1982 general election, defeating Republican Millicent Fenwick. Kean appointed Lautenberg to complete the final days of the term. Lautenberg started his first full term in January 1983 and served three six-year terms before deciding not to seek re-election in 2001. His retirement was short-lived, however. Lautenberg returned to the Senate in 2003 to replace fellow Democrat Robert Torricelli on the ballot. Torricelli, who had served one term, quit his re-election bid in 2002 over an ethics probe. Democrat domination continued until Christie appointed Chiesa, the state's former attorney general, to Lautenberg's seat on June 6. Chiesa was sworn in four days later.  Our ruling Lonegan said during a radio interview, ""I would be the first Republican senator elected in New Jersey in 41 years."" In 1972, New Jersey sent Republican Clifford Case to the U.S. Senate to serve a fourth term, but he lost a Republican primary re-election bid in 1978, to Jeffrey Bell. Since then, New Jersey voters have not elected another GOP candidate to the Senate. Republicans from New Jersey served in the Senate for eight months during 1982, and since mid-June, but both were appointed, not elected. We rate Lonegan's claim True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com. Editor's Note: The 'Our Ruling' section of this story has been corrected to reflect that Clifford Case lost the Republican primary in 1978 to Jeffrey Bell, not Bill Bradley.",/factchecks/2013/sep/29/steve-lonegan/steve-lonegan-claims-he-could-be-first-republican-/

Tens of thousands of U.S. service members missing, Wisconsin veterans official says
","To remember prisoners of war and members of the military missing in action, state Veterans Affairs Secretary John Scocos issued a statement on Sept. 20, 2013 -- national POW-MIA Recognition Day. The statement included this claim: ""There are still tens of thousands of missing service members from previous and current conflicts that our nation is working to find and repatriate."" A reader asked us: Tens of thousands? The answer hinges on how missing is defined. Previous factcheck It turns out Scocos wasn’t the first to make such a claim. A New Jersey state lawmaker said in 2011 that nearly ""88,000 United States service members are still missing and unaccounted for, dating back to World War II."" PolitiFact New Jersey rated the statement Mostly True. Our colleagues found that a couple of months earlier, the federal Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office had revised its figure of missing and unaccounted for from 88,000 to 83,601. In checking Scocos’ claim, we found the most recent tally, as of Sept. 11, 2013, shows a slightly lower figure -- 83,343 service members as being unaccounted for. ""It’s not something that the average person is aware of,"" Jessica Pierno, spokeswoman for the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office, told us. Here’s a breakdown from the office, which was formed in 1993:   World War II Korean War Cold War Vietnam War Iraq and other conflicts Total 73,661 7,906 126 1,644 6 83,343   The tallies make it clear that the federal government’s search-and-recovery efforts -- coordinated by the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office and the federal Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command -- are for remains. ""In all of the years we have been doing this, we have never found one to be alive,"" said Pierno, a native of Virocqua in western Wisconsin. But there is always hope when it comes to those missing from recent conflicts, she said. Here’s how Pierno described the search process: ""Imagine a cold-case detective piecing together historical documents,"" she said. Staff review a missing service person’s files, interview witnesses and use other methods to determine where the person went missing. If a precise location is found, a team travels there and does an excavation not unlike archeologists searching for dinosaur bones. ""There have been identifications made from a single tooth"" and strands of hair, Pierno said. Even service members missing from World War II can be identified by matching DNA from remains to the DNA of a family member. Indeed, the list of missing continues to get a little bit smaller as more service members are accounted for. For example, a burial was scheduled for Sept. 28, 2013, in Springville, Utah, following the recent recovery of the remains of 2nd Lt. Vernal J. Bird. His bomber crashed in New Guinea in March 1944. The remains of Marine Lance Cpl. Merlin R. Allen of Bayfield, Wis., who was lost June 30, 1967, in a helicopter crash in Thua Thien-Hue Province, Vietnam, were identified in February 2013. A funeral was held several months later. Accounting for the missing has not gone without controversy. On Sept. 19, 2013, several weeks after a U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing examined the recovery efforts, Senators Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) called on the Defense Department to address ""reports of mismanagement and internal divisions"" between the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office and the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command. ""While we were encouraged to hear that DMPO and JPAC have finally begun work on the long overdue plan"" to delineate responsibilities, the senators said in a statement, ""we were concerned to hear that the plan was still in ‘coordination.' We were also troubled to learn that the department's approach to accounting may be doing families more harm than good by failing to provide them with a realistic assessment of the possibility of identifying missing service members."" At the hearing, the director of the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office had said that during the past year, he and ""others in the personnel accounting community have made significant strides in improving our unity of effort. But this is an issue that clearly needs further work."" Our rating Scocos said: ""There are still tens of thousands of missing service members from previous and current conflicts that our nation is working to find and repatriate."" One of the federal agencies responsible for searching for the missing, or at least their remains, puts the official count at more than 83,000 -- all of whom, or nearly all of whom, are deceased.

Deadspin says URI basketball coach is highest paid R.I. state employee
","For years, the lofty pay of college football and basketball coaches has been the subject of controversy. And that has drawn the attention of the popular sports website Deadspin. Deadspin claims, based on news media reports and state salary databases, that the large majority of the highest-paid state employees in each state are football and basketball coaches, some of whom have multimillion-dollar compensation packages. And the website says that this calls into question our priorities as a society. The highest-paid employee in Rhode Island, according to Deadspin, is the men’s basketball coach at the University of Rhode Island. We know that has been true in the past, but we decided to dig into the numbers to see whether it remains true. A quick trip to the state’s ""Transparency Portal"" website confirmed what we suspected -- URI basketball coach Daniel Hurley is the highest-paid, at $597,500 per year. Hurley actually can bank a lot more money than that -- but we’ll address that later. The second highest-paid -- but well behind Hurley -- is URI President David M. Dooley, at $320,000. After Hurley and Dooley, according to the Transparency Portal, the top five include Stella Adeniyi, a registered nurse in the Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals, at $276,335 (she exceeds her base pay in overtime alone); Ray M. DiPasquale, president of the Community College of Rhode Island, $265,000; and Donald DeHayes, URI provost and vice president for academic affairs, $245,923. By comparison, Governor Chafee earns a salary of $129,210. We asked URI spokeswoman Linda Acciardo to provide a detailed account of Hurley’s compensation. She provided his contract. The sources and total of Hurley’s compensation, under his six-year employment contract, which expires April 7, 2018, may come as a revelation to some Rhode Islanders. He begins with a base salary of $300,000 and adds another $297,500 in bonuses and incentives -- all payable with university money -- but that’s not all. In our examination, we won’t cover non-cash benefits because those are excluded from Deadspin’s report. But as an aside, we note that Hurley’s benefits include the receipt of 20 VIP tickets for each men’s basketball home game and two parking passes for all URI athletic events. If his Rams team qualifies for the Atlantic 10 conference, National Collegiate Athletic Association or National Invitation Tournament playoffs, he would receive 12 tickets for each game in which the Rams appear. If his team makes it to the NCAA ""Final 4,"" he would receive four tickets. Also not counted in his annual cash compensation of $597,500, but potentially lucrative, is his contractual entitlement to operate a summer youth basketball camp and to keep the proceeds, minus the cost of using URI facilities. But let’s return to those cash bonuses and incentives above and beyond his $300,000 base salary. They include a guaranteed $175,000 of the gate receipts for home games, escalating by $15,000 on Oct. 1 of each year of the contract. So, this Oct. 1 he is scheduled to begin receiving $190,000, paid in quarterly installments. He is also guaranteed $65,000 for one away game. That money comes from a guarantee fee paid by the hosting school. Major programs routinely offer guarantee fees to attract non-conference opponents to their arenas, without having to later visit those schools as in a traditional home-and-home arrangement. In recent years, URI has been paid varying fees to visit Auburn, Syracuse and Duke; this year, it will make a visit to Louisiana State. Other guaranteed payments are $50,000 to participate in the men’s basketball radio and TV programs; $10,000 to participate in athletic events and other university functions; and a $12,000 ""motor vehicle stipend"" paid with donations raised by the Fast Break Basketball Booster Club. In addition, if the booster club generates gross revenue of at least $150,000, Hurley would be paid $5,000 by the club; if the gross ticket revenue for home games exceeds $1 million, he would be paid $25,000; and if his team members achieve a 2.5 grade point average or a 2.75 grade point average, he would be paid $7,500 or $10,000, respectively. Hurley also receives a maximum $8,000 annually, from booster club donations, to pay dues and other costs arising from his membership in a beach or country club. Then there are a series of potential, but much less likely, payments by URI -- none of which he has achieved in the one full season since he was hired -- depending on how the team finishes and whether he wins a coaching honor. If the team finishes first or tied for first in its conference, or if it wins the conference tournament  championship, he gets another $20,000. If URI plays in a first, second and third-round NCAA post-season tournament game, Hurley gets $20,000 per game. And if the team reaches the ""Sweet 16,"" ""Elite 8,"" ""Final 4,"" and national championship post-season rounds, he gets an additional $25,000 for each game played in those rounds. It is worthwhile to remember that the Rams have not qualified for the NCAA Tournament since 1999, have gone to the Sweet 16 only twice in history, to the Elite 8, once, and to the Final 4 or national championship game, never. If URI goes to the lesser post-season tournament, the NIT, he gets $5,000. If he wins Coach of the Year from the Atlantic 10 or a successor conference, he scores a $5,000 bonus, and NCAA National Coach of the Year, $10,000. The total of the guaranteed cash sums to be paid directly with university money is $600,000, which is $2,500 more than the $597,500 listed for Hurley in the Transparency Portal. Acciardo said the slight discrepancy probably is attributable to payments due but actually disbursed outside the 2012-2013 fiscal year. Our ruling The sports website Deadspin says the University of Rhode Island men’s basketball coach is the highest paid state employee. It’s a slam dunk.

R.I. coastal official says rising sea levels from climate change could swamp Waterplace Park in Providence and Wickford village
","A United Nations-supported panel of the world’s top climate scientists issued its latest assessment of the problem Friday, warning of potentially catastrophic consequences unless significant measures are taken to reduce greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide. Among other things, the report -- a summary of a longer study to be issued Monday -- warned that if emissions aren’t reduced, global sea levels could rise nearly three feet by 2100. Grover Fugate, executive director of Rhode Island’s Coastal Resources Management Council, expressed similar, and more dire, concerns during an interview on WPRI-Channel 12’s ""Newsmakers"" program, broadcast Aug. 23. Fugate warned then that some projections showed sea levels rising as much as six feet over the next 100 years. If that happened, he said, some of the state’s signature landscapes, such as Providence’s Waterplace Park and North Kingstown’s Wickford Village could be very different -- and smaller --  by 2100. ""The upper end of that range is now looking like, more like, six feet,"" Fugate said. ""Waterplace Park would essentially be gone … you look at places like Wickford, so the historic district in Wickford, a lot of that would be lost."" Waterplace Pond instead of Waterplace Park? Wickford swamped? Was that a deep thought or shallow reasoning? We decided to wade in. Friday’s report from the climate panel is just the latest of numerous reports and studies of the effect of climate change on sea levels. In December 2012,  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Department of Defense’s Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program and the Army Corps of Engineers prepared a report called ""Global Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States National Climate Assessment.""   The report said that an increasing number of studies have shown satellite measurements indicating polar ice, mostly from Greenland in the north and western Antarctica in the south, has been melting more rapidly than was previously thought, in turn making sea levels rise faster and higher than past projections.   The NOAA report warned the melting would increase sea levels, but the range it gave was higher than that described in Friday’s IPCC report. ""We have a very high confidence (a better than nine in ten chance) that global mean sea level will rise at least 0.2 meters (8 inches) and no more than 2 meters (6.6 feet) by 2100,""  the 2012 multi-agency assessment said. Fugate said it was that ""upper end"" -- up to 6.6 feet -- that he was referencing. The University of Rhode Island’s Graduate School of Oceanography’s Sea Grant program has been interested in rising sea levels too. The program works with the state’s coastal municipalities to anticipate where sea levels may rise and how to cope with it. Jon Reiner, town planner in North Kingstown, said the Sea Grant staffers have analyzed what would happen in his community with the kind of sea-level rises Fugate cited. He said their analyses confirmed Fugate’s warning. A 6-foot sea level increase, Reiner said, would inundate more than 150 parcels of land in the Wickford area, as much as 5 percent of the town. Teresa Crean, a planner with the URI Sea Grant program, said the value of that lost land was about $80 million. In Providence, the effects of rising sea levels can be seen on a website of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration that shows the foot-by-foot effects of rising sea levels. The interactive map doesn’t include storm surges or runoff, only what increases in sea level would do. According to NOAA,  a 6-foot rise in sea level would submerge the walkway around the Waterplace Park pool and enough water would flow through the tunnel under Memorial Boulevard to put the Capital Grille and Bar Louie on their own waterfront. But according to the NOAA, Waterplace Park might be the least of the city’s worries. Even more vulnerable are the wharfs off Allens Avenue in the area between Sassafras Point and Henderson Street. Parts of the newly cleared Route 195 redevelopment area would flood, as well as the neighborhood around the Providence District Court Building. Our ruling Grover Fugate said Providence’s Waterplace Park and Wickford village would be flooded if sea levels rose six feet, ""the upper end"" of some climate change estimates.

New Hampshire AFL-CIO says Maggie Hassan is only female governor in country
","New Hampshire voters made a splash in November 2012 by sending the country’s first all-female delegation to Congress. The state also elected Democrat Maggie Hassan as its governor. With women continuing to be underrepresented politics, the electoral sweep garnered national attention, including from political powerhouse EMILY’s List, which backs female candidates. EMILY’s List hosted its second ""Madam President"" town hall discussion in Manchester, N.H., on Friday, Sept. 27, 2013. Hassan was among the speakers at the event, which focused on promoting women candidates for political office, including the presidency. Coverage of the event quickly took to social media. ""At  Emily list event in manchester nh,"" reads a message posted to the NH AFL-CIO’s Twitter account on Friday morning, Sept. 27. ""Gov Hassen (sic) address a gathering as only women governor in the country."" People quickly took to Twitter to tweak the tweeter’s grammar — and also to challenge the assertion that Hassan stands alone as the only female governor in the country. So we decided to check into it. Hassan is actually one of five women who are currently serving as governors. She’s joined by Republicans Jan Brewer of Arizona, Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, Nikki Haley of South Carolina, and Susana Martinez of New Mexico. Hassan is the only Democrat in the bunch -- and female governors are scarce. The Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University in New Jersey has compiled a definitive history of the country’s female governors. The center determined that 35 women have served as governors in 26 states. The first state to elect a female governor was Wyoming, where voters put Nellie Tayloe Ross into office in 1924. Before that, the former Wyoming Territories also passed the first law in U.S. history explicitly granting women the right to vote. Wyoming went on to approve the first constitution in the world granting full voting rights to women in 1889. In New Hampshire, former state Senate President Vesta Roy holds the title of the first woman to serve as governor. Roy, a Republican, held the position for seven days after the death of Gov. Hugh Gallen in 1982. She was replaced a week later when Gov. John H. Sununu was sworn into office. The Granite State's first elected female governor was Democrat Jeanne Shaheen, who served from 1997-2003, and was later elected to the U.S. Senate. Arizona claims the title of the first state to elect four women to serve as governor. It was also the first state to elect two successive women governors. Throughout history, 20 Democratic women and 15 Republican women have served as governors. Before Hassan took office, the last two Democratic governors were Christine Gregoire, of Washington, and Beverly Perdue, of North Carolina, who both served until 2013. Hassan’s distinction as the country’s only Democratic female governor at the moment might have been the distinction the AFL-CIO was aiming for when it tweeted about Hassan’s speech at the event in Manchester. We placed a call to NH AFL-CIO headquarters to inquire about the source of their tweet. President Mark MacKenzie said he was responsible for publishing the information, and acknowledged the error. MacKenzie said he was attempting to summarize information from Hassan’s introduction. ""I think I made a mistake,"" he said. ""I’m new at tweeting, and so I was trying to tweet and listen and tweet and listen and take pictures."" Our ruling The New Hampshire AFL-CIO stated that Gov. Hassan is the only female governor in the country. While Hassan is the only Democratic governor, she’s one of five women holding governorships around the country. While that’s still far from being representative of the gender balance in the country, Hassan isn’t the only female governor. We rate this claim False.  ",/factchecks/2013/sep/27/nh-afl-cio/new-hampshire-afl-cio-says-maggie-hassan-only-fema/

Saxby Chambliss says Obamacare is biggest entitlement U.S. taxpayers have ever seen
","Part of the argument made by critics of President Barack Obama’s health care law is that the law imposes big financial commitments in perpetuity, particularly for subsidizing health insurance for Americans who otherwise couldn’t afford it. On CNN’s Crossfire, Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., argued that the nation simply can’t afford this sort of ongoing entitlement. ""We're fixing to get hit with the biggest entitlement program the American taxpayers have ever seen -- $2.6 trillion over the next 10 years,"" Chambliss said. (For those who aren’t familiar with this particular southernism, ""fixing to"" means ""about to."") Is Obamacare really ""the biggest entitlement program the American taxpayers have ever seen""? Comparing spending on entitlements between 2014 and 2023 The term ""entitlement"" is generally used to describe a program that provides benefits to anyone who meets certain criteria, rather than spending money doled out by Congress on an annual basis. In official budget-speak, it refers to programs deemed ""mandatory."" When we asked Chambliss’ office where they got the $2.6 trillion figure, a spokeswoman pointed to a calculation by the Senate Budget Committee’s Republican staff. The committee concluded that the cost of Obamacare ""will amount to at least $2.6 trillion"" over the 10-year period from 2014 to 2023. This calculation has sparked some dissent. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytical arm of Congress, has calculated the gross cost of Obamacare’s coverage provisions at approximately $1.8 trillion over the same 10-year period. These costs include spending on increased payments for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, subsidies for insurance purchased on the newly created marketplaces, and tax credits for small businesses. (The CBO figure would be $1.2 trillion if you exclude Medicaid and CHIP on the theory that they’re expansions of existing entitlements, rather than new entitlements.) In any case, to check the accuracy of Chambliss’ claim, it doesn’t matter whether you use the $1.8 trillion figure or the $2.6 trillion figure, because we found at least three entitlement programs -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- that CBO estimates will have higher costs over the same 10-year period that Chambliss was referring to. • Social Security. According to CBO, the 10-year cost of Social Security -- both old-age benefits and disability payments -- is about $11 trillion. • Medicare: The cost for Medicare, the health program that serves all Americans 65 and older, is estimated to be $8 trillion over the same 10-year period, accoring to CBO. • Medicaid: The federal share of Medicaid, the joint state-federal program to provide health care for low-income Americans, is projected to be $4.3 trillion over the same 10-year period, CBO says. Each of these three programs exceeds even the higher, $2.6 trillion estimate of Obamacare’s costs over the exact same 10-year period. But this isn’t the way Chambliss was looking at it. Chambliss’ rationale Instead, Chambliss’ office said he was referring to the initial estimated costs of those programs when they were launched. The figures cited above for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid ""reference today’s outrageous costs of those programs due to many years of expansion,"" Chambliss’ office said in a statement. ""When the American people were first given these three programs, costs were much lower."" To back up this assertion, Chambliss’ office provided us with the initial cost estimates for all three programs. The estimate for Medicaid is not precisely comparable, so we’ll focus instead on Social Security and Medicare. For Social Security, we didn’t have figures for all 10 years, but we averaged the 1940, 1945 and 1950 figures and multiplied the results by 10. When we adjusted the cost for inflation, the initial 10-year estimated cost worked out to be about $34 billion in today’s dollars. That’s well below the initial 10-year cost of Obamacare. For Medicare, we did have estimates for Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) between 1966 and 1975, though the estimates for Part B (medical insurance) were not in a comparable form. For Part A, we added up the first 10 years’ estimates, adjusted for inflation, and came up with a total of about $215 billion in today’s dollars. That, too, is well before the first 10 years’ costs of Obamacare. Analysis We don’t think that, for the average viewer, Chambliss’ explanation would be the most obvious understanding of what he said. We think the simplest reading of his claim is that Obamacare is ""the biggest entitlement program the American taxpayers have ever seen,"" without limiting the comparison to initial cost estimates that are decades old. And even if it were, it’s not clear that the comparison Chambliss is making is valid. A somewhat better way to do it is to measure the cost as a percentage of gross domestic product, economists told us. So we took the one-year average for each program’s initial 10-year period, then divided this by the midpoint year’s GDP. (We did not adjust for inflation.) We found that during its first 10 years, Social Security, on average, accounted for 0.1 percent of the 1945-level GDP. The equivalent figure for Medicare, using the 1970 GDP, was 0.3 percent. And for Obamacare, using the Senate Budget Committee Republicans’ number and the CBO’s GDP projection for 2019, it worked out to 1.1 percent of GDP. The percentage is lower if you use the CBO estimate (0.8 percent of GDP) or if you use the CBO figure minus Medicaid (0.5 percent of GDP). In other words, using the GDP-adjusted calculation and conceding Chambliss’ terms, the senator from Georgia has a point. That said, there are still problems with Chambliss’ methodology. While Medicare and Obamacare are both health insurance programs, the cost of medical care has skyrocketed since the mid 1960s. So counting the 10-year costs for any medical program starting in 2014 will inevitably produce a much higher cost than the first 10 years of a medical program that started in 1966. This biases the comparison. Also, Chambliss’ comparison doesn’t factor in population growth. The universe of possible Social Security beneficiaries in 1940 -- those 65 or older -- was just 12 million. By comparison, by 2022, CBO expects 22 million people to obtain insurance on the Obamacare exchanges and an additional 17 million people to obtain insurance through the law’s expansion of Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Combined, that’s a universe of beneficiaries three times larger than those who might have qualified for Social Security in 1940. So Chambliss’ comparison is not apples to apples. Our ruling Chambliss said that with Obamacare, ""we're fixing to get hit with the biggest entitlement program the American taxpayers have ever seen."" Measured by the most obvious standard -- whether there’s ever been a bigger entitlement program -- Obamacare is hardly the biggest. Over the next 10 years, Obamacare ranks no higher than fourth, trailing Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. If you use a less obvious standard -- restricting it to the initial projected costs for the first 10 years of any entitlement program -- Obamacare does rank as the biggest as a percentage of GDP, though that’s shaped by differences in population growth and medical inflation that make comparisons questionable. We rate his statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/sep/27/saxby-chambliss/saxby-chambliss-says-obamacare-biggest-entitlement/

Robert Reich says under sanctions, 'Iran is suffering 30% inflation, 20% unemployment'
","An Iranian president says he’s ready to resolve the nation’s nuclear standoff with the West — what gives? Former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich gives at least partial credit to economic pain orchestrated by the United States and international allies. While the United States must still be ""very cautious,"" he said on ABC’s This Week, ""one of the big lessons here is that economic sanctions do seem to work. ""Right now Iran is suffering 30 percent inflation, 20 percent unemployment,"" he told a roundtable including CNN’s Newt Gingrich, ABC’s Jonathan Karl and PBS’ Gwen Ifill. ""I mean this nation is hurting and our economic sanctions, because we've been patient with them, because we have actually rounded up almost every other nation to support us, have had a huge impact."" Is Iran suffering such high inflation and unemployment under economic sanctions? Tumbling oil exports Now, economic sanctions are nothing new for Iran, which has faced U.S. sanctions since its 1979 Islamic revolution. But the pressure has been rising. Other nations have joined in sanctions since 2006 in response to Iran’s efforts to develop a nuclear weapon, according to a report by Kenneth Katzman of the Congressional Research Service, which provides nonpartisan analysis to Congress. Oil exports, which fund nearly half of Iran’s government spending, have fallen by about half since 2011, from about 2.5 million barrels a day to about 1.25 million. The drop has been driven, Katzman says, by a European Union embargo and U.S. pressure on Iranian oil customers. Iran also lost access to the international banking system. The combination has caused a sharp drop in the value of Iran’s currency, the rial, Katzman says. Meanwhile, sanctions helped trigger a recession that’s driving up unemployment. Has that meant ""30 percent inflation, 20 percent unemployment,"" as Reich told ABC viewers? There’s not a simple answer. Inflation estimates range from 30 percent to 70 percent. Official unemployment statistics, meanwhile, are out of date, and outside experts question their accuracy, anyway. The International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development don’t have up-to-date figures for Iranian unemployment. Still, Reich’s in range. Gary Hufbauer, a former U.S. Treasury official and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who has studied sanctions for 30 years, said Reich’s numbers ""seem reasonable."" Here’s how the Congressional Research Service put it in June: Inflation: 30 percent plus, according to Iran Central Bank in May 2013, but believed to be over 50 percent by outside experts. Unemployment rate: Official rate is 15.3 percent as of the end of 2011, but outside experts believe the rate is higher. Reich pointed us to news articles from the Associated Press and energy news site OilPrice.com — which offer some support for his numbers while highlighting the uncertainty. The Associated Press reported in June inflation ""over 30 percent,"" though it cited a 14 percent unemployment rate. OilPrices.com noted Sept. 19 that analysts outside the country found that unemployment rate ""impossible to believe,"" and quoted an estimate from Mehrdad Emadi, an Iranian-born economic adviser to the European Union, of more than 20 percent. (The OilPrices.com report echoes a Reuters report from the same day.) So ""reasonable"" seems like a fair assessment for Reich’s numbers. We should also note there’s not universal agreement on the size of sanctions’ role in all that financial pain, which experts also attribute to Iran’s fiscal management. Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley with a background in economics, told PolitiFact it just makes sense unemployment and inflation would follow a slash in oil exports. ""The typical consequence for a nation dependent on exports when those exports are cut is high inflation and high unemployment,"" he said. Michael Malloy, a professor at the University of the Pacific’s McGeorge School of Law who specializes in banking regulation and economic sanctions, told PolitiFact ""it's likely to be a much more complicated picture."" Our ruling Reich told ABC viewers that under economic sanctions, ""now Iran is suffering 30 percent inflation"" and ""20 percent unemployment."" Iran’s own statistics aren’t widely trusted and international organizations don’t have recent unemployment figures. But those numbers fall within a broad range of expert estimates cited by news reports and the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. It’s worth noting that Iran’s economic struggle has been exacerbated by its own economic policies and other factors, not just sanctions. Still, there’s good evidence they’ve had a ""huge impact,"" as Reich said. We rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/27/robert-reich/robert-reich-says-under-sanctions-iran-suffering-3/

Obama says half of Americans have a pre-existing condition
","The Obama administration is trying to rebut critics who have labeled Obamacare one of the most destructive laws in the nation’s history. At an event in Maryland on Sept. 26, 2013, President Barack Obama highlighted the program’s benefits. High on his list was the new rule about pre-existing conditions, health problems that insurance companies use to deny coverage to would-be new customers. Under the Affordable Care Act, no insurer will be allowed to turn someone down due to a pre-existing condition. This, Obama said, will make a big difference. ""Up to half of all Americans have a pre-existing condition,"" he told the crowd in Maryland. A reader found this confusing and asked us, ""So that meant 150 million people could not have insurance?"" The answer is ""no"" and here we’ll explain why and rate the accuracy of the president’s claim. We looked into a very similar statement not too long ago. A problem with your health versus a problem with the insurance company When Obama said as many as half of all Americans have a pre-existing condition, he was describing the number of people who have heart disease, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, mental illness or any of a number of other maladies. It was a statement about the prevalence of those illnesses across the population. If you already have insurance and develop one of these problems, generally, your insurance company will pay for treatment. But if you show up in the individual insurance market wanting to buy coverage, and you already have one of these diseases, generally speaking, you would be out of luck. In the view of the insurance company, you would have a pre-existing condition and they would not pay to treat it. Or they might charge you a much higher premium. Since about 85 percent of Americans already have insurance, many through large group plans, this would not be a concern. But for those who don’t, it matters. The Affordable Care Act provision is aimed at those people. By the way, the law has had this protection for children since it was passed in 2010. As of Jan. 1, 2014, the rule extends to adults. Getting back to the reader’s confusion, while half of all Americans might have one of these illnesses, most of them don’t bump up against the insurance companies’ restrictions. Obama was talking about the benefit to the smaller group for whom this would be a problem. Now, let’s consider whether in fact, up to half of all Americans have one of these health problems. Pre-existing is in the eye of the insurer There are a range of estimates for the number of people with health issues that would put them at risk of running afoul of an insurance company. One reason is that insurers have different lists of conditions that raise a red flag. Similarly, researchers can take a conservative approach and use a short list or be more expansive with a longer one. White House staff pointed us to an analysis from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That study used a short list of diseases and a longer one, with both lists based on the policies of private and public insurance programs. The report found a range of 19 percent to 50 percent of all Americans with health conditions that could disqualify them for coverage or lead to higher premiums. The president reflected that range when he said ""up to half of all Americans."" There are other studies that generally mirror the Health and Humans Services findings, although they focus on adults. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, examined five studies on the prevalence of pre-existing conditions. The lowest estimate counted just eight diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease and stroke. That study came up with about 36 million people between 19 and 64 who have one of those health issues. Another study used a list of 60 conditions and arrived at 60 million who might be vulnerable to denial of coverage. The GAO itself used medical survey data and reached a high-end estimate of 122 million. As percentages, this translates into a low-end estimate of 20 percent of American adults potentially at risk, 66 percent on the high end. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, notes that projections of the scope of the problem can miss the mark. The administration expected about 375,000 people would enroll in a special insurance program for those who had been denied coverage but as of January 2013, only about 107,000 had. That said, many factors apart from health could have affected enrollments. Our ruling Obama said up to half of all Americans have a pre-existing condition. A government study put the range at 19 percent to 50 percent. Most other studies suggest the percentage is less than 50 percent. The president relied on the highest estimate but qualified his claim by saying ""up to"" which is technically accurate. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/27/barack-obama/obama-says-half-americans-have-preexisting-conditi/

McAuliffe says Cuccinelli tax cuts could eliminate ""over 8,000 teachers""
","Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe is sounding alarms that Republican Ken Cuccinelli’s tax cut plan could force a massive layoff of teachers.   ""School divisions across Virginia could be forced to fire over 8,000 teachers to mask up the shortfall, ""McAuliffe declared in a Sept. 12 posting on his website entitled ""Virginia Schools in Danger."" He has made similar comments on the campaign trail.   We wondered if McAuliffe’s statement is accurate. There are slightly more than 100,000 public school teachers in Virginia. McAuliffe is saying his opponent is open to expelling 8 percent of them in favor of cut taxes.     In May, Cuccinelli announced a plan to slice the top personal income tax bracket from 5.75 to 5 percent and the corporate income tax rate 6 percent to 4 percent. After they’re fully implemented over four years, the cuts would reduce general fund revenues by $1.4 billion annually. Cuccinelli said he would offset the loss by eliminating tax loopholes and exemptions and limiting the increase in new spending. McAuliffe’s math McAuliffe arrived at his layoff figure by extrapolating numbers in report critical of Cuccinelli’s tax plan by the Virginia Education Association, an organization representing more than 60,000 teachers. The group has endorsed McAuliffe for governor. During this budget year, which began July 1, the state will spend just under 30 percent of its general fund dollars on public schools. About $5.3 billion of the $17.6 billion fund has been appropriated for K-12 education. Cuccinelli’s $1.4 billion tax cut comes to just 8 percent of the current general fund. The VEA assumed that all major programs in the general fund -- mostly education, health and public safety -- would be cut by 8 percent to pay for Cuccinelli’s tax plan. That would come to about a $420 million reduction for education. The average salary and benefits total for a teacher is $64,635, the VEA said, so a $420 million loss would amount to losing support for about 6,530 teachers. McAuliffe posted these findings on Facebook. But McAuliffe’s campaign didn’t stop there. It ran its own numbers with an assumption that education would be cut more than other general fund programs. For example, Medicaid has been taking a growing share of the general fund budget -- 21 percent in fiscal year 2012. Because it’s an entitlement program, it would be very difficult to cut, the campaign says. McAuliffe’s advisers pointed to several other general fund programs that they said are locked in or difficult to cut, such as debt service and money for the judicial and legislative branches. When these programs are taken off the table, the campaign says education comprised 37.5 percent of the remaining general fund. So McAuliffe’s people concluded that Cuccinelli might have to rely on education to pay for 37.5 percent of his $1.4 billion tax cuts. That comes out to $525 million. And when they divided $525 million by the average salary and benefits cost for a teacher, they came up with 8,122 teachers who could be laid off. Problems with McAuliffe’s formula  Cuccinelli says he is not contemplating cutting education and has denounced his opponent for making a ""false and misleading"" attack. Despite all the assumptions McAuliffe built into his estimate, he ignored Cuccinelli’s important pledge to offset the cost of the tax cut by eliminating some tax loopholes and cap the growth in state spending.   McAuliffe’s campaign is cynical about the pledge, accurately noting that Cuccinelli has declined to identify a single loophole he’d be willing to close. Cuccinelli says he would appoint a commission to rank tax exemptions in order of their effectiveness and urge the General Assembly to repeal the worst ones. There may be plenty of slack in Virginia’s loopholes. A report by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission valued the exemptions allowed in 2008 at $12.5 billion. That almost equals the $14.3 billion in general fund taxes the state collected that year. Most of the exemptions were approved for tax policy reasons, such as conforming certain Virginia tax laws to federal codes or weeding out inconsistencies that could lead to double taxation, according to the report. But JLARC also found that about $2.9 billion of the breaks were designed to promote public policies, such as helping the coal industry or encouraging land preservation. Many of these, JLARC said, could be easily eliminated or streamlined ""without undermining principles of sound tax policy."" McAuliffe’s estimate also ignores revenue offsets that would come from Cuccinelli’s policy of capping spending increases to the combined annual rises in Virginia’s rates of inflation and population growth. Last year, the general fund budget grew by 5.8 percent while the combined rates of inflation and population growth expanded by 3.3 percent. Had Cuccinelli’s cap been in effect, the state would have spent about about $415 million less. There’s one last important point that McAuliffe also ignored: Cuccinelli has promised he would abandon his tax cuts if he and the General Assembly cannot agree on a way offset their costs. ""If I don’t succeed in reining in government growth and if I don’t succeed in getting the exemptions and loopholes identified to pay for the tax cuts, we don’t get the tax cuts,"" Cuccinelli said during a July 20 debate with McAuliffe. Our ruling McAuliffe says that under Cuccinelli’s tax cut plan, ""school divisions across Virginia could be force to fire over 8,000 teachers."" The claim is based on assumptions that ignore Cuccinelli’s promise to offset the $1.4 billion cost of his tax cut by closing tax loopholes and capping the increase of future spending. Cuccinelli has frustrated many by refusing to name any tax exemptions he would eliminate. But a state auditing commission has said the $12 billion or so in tax breaks given by the state each year is fertile ground to find savings. McAuliffe seeks cover for his statement by saying the layoffs ""could"" happen. That overlooks Cuccinelli’s pledge that he’ll abandon the tax cuts if the legislature is unwilling to pay for them by ending loopholes and limiting spending increases. So McAuliffe’s doomsday estimate only works by twisting Cuccinelli’s plan into an unrecognizable shape. We rate his statement False.  ",/factchecks/2013/sep/27/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-cuccinelli-tax-cuts-could-eliminate/

Rep. Graves wrong about Buffett's health law stance
","As the nation winds down to a government shutdown and possible default on its debt, the fight over President Barack Obama’s health care law continues. PolitiFact Georgia was asked to check a claim made by Georgia Congressman Tom Graves about the law, more commonly referred to as Obamacare. Graves, a Republican from Ranger, has become one of the legislative leaders for a GOP push in the U.S. House to defund Obama’s health care law in order to prevent the government shutdown. During an appearance last weekend on ABC’s ""This Week,"" Graves defended his plan and cited additional evidence to show that support for Obamacare is dwindling. In response to a question about a Wall Street Journal editorial regarding the GOPs inept strategizing on budget issues, Graves said: ""That’s their opinion. An editorial clearly is what that is. But when you read the Chicago Tribune, they say delay and stop Obamacare,"" Graves said. ""Warren Buffett says stop it now, start over. … It’s not just Republicans, this is widespread."" Graves’ comments about Buffett were familiar to us and to our audience, which asked us to review the claim. Did Warren Buffett, one of Obama’s early presidential backers, withdraw support for the president’s signature public policy legacy? Graves’ claim about Buffett was set in motion by posts from conservative bloggers, who began posting earlier this month, that the Omaha billionaire recently said ""scrap Obamacare and start all over."" The claim originated with a Sept. 13 post on Money Morning website titled ""Buffett: Scrap Obamacare and Start Over."" That post used a portion of Buffett’s comments from three years ago, before the health care law was passed. Other sites, including the Weekly Standard and Wall Street Journal, linked to or included portions of the Money Morning post in their stories. Our PolitiFact national colleagues recently completed a fact check of the bloggers’ claim, and found the statements were taken out of context and not representative of Buffett’s opinions. The claim was rated Pants On Fire. The same day as the Sept. 17 PolitiFact article, the Washington Examiner also ran a story discrediting the bloggers’ Buffett claim. And FactCheck.org reviewed the claim this week. We asked Graves’ office about his ABC News statements. The office noted that the Money Morning claim, along with follow-up stories by other media outlets, included inaccurate timeline context with their Buffett claim. But outside of the faulty time element, Buffett did say he would stop Obamacare, start over and explain how to do that, Graves’ office said. And, because Graves did not attribute an inaccurate time frame to Buffett’s comments, they believe his statement was true, the office said. But what exactly did Buffett say about Obamacare, when did he say it and what are his current thoughts on the matter? Buffett’s Obamacare statements included in the Money Morning blog were taken from an interview he gave with CNBC on March 1, 2010. A Politico article from the same year -- which was also quoted by Graves’ office in response to our questions -- summarized the interview. In that interview, Buffett was asked whether he was ""in favor of scrapping this and going back to start over."" He said: ""I would be if I were President Obama."" What the blog posts and Graves did not include in their comments was the full context of Buffett’s statements. At the time, Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., was referring to a pending health care bill. (The Affordable Care Act was signed into law days later on March 23, 2010.) Buffett went on to say that he would be in favor of scrapping the Senate version of the bill, but that he’d vote for it instead of doing nothing. Ultimately, Buffett said he’d like to see a plan that really attacked (health care) costs. Last week, Buffett refuted the assertion that he did not support Obamacare. ""I’ve never suggested nor thought Obamacare should be scrapped,"" Buffett said in an interview with the Omaha World-Herald. ""I support it. It relates to providing medical care for all Americans. That’s something I’ve thought should be done for a long, long time."" Buffett’s assistant, Debbie Bosanek, told us in an email that Buffett’s office set the record straight for any news organization that contacted them. She also mentioned her boss’s explanation during a CNBC news interview last week. After fact checkers began exploring the claim, the Weekly Standard updated its original blog post to say: ""It appears that Buffett made his anti-Obamacare comments in 2010, thereby showing that he, like most of the American people, has opposed Obamacare since even before it was passed …"" So what about Graves’ claim? The Georgia congressman stated that Warren Buffett said stop Obamacare now and start over. The claim was similar to other blogger claims debunked by fact checkers, and based on an interview Buffett gave three years ago before Obamacare was signed into law. Buffett did say he would scrap the then Senate bill, but also noted that he would vote for it instead of continuing with the existing health care situation. Graves’ claim may not have misrepresented Buffett’s comments as being recent like the bloggers did, but his comments were made after similar claims about Buffett were found to be misleading. And Graves still made the claim, without any additional context, five days after several fact checkers debunked the claim. We rate Graves’ statement Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2013/sep/27/tom-graves/rep-graves-wrong-about-buffetts-health-law-stance/

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., pulled out a dramatic statistic during a Sept. 24, 2013, back-and-forth with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on CNN’s Crossfire. ""One out of four corporations doesn't pay a nickel in taxes,"" Sanders said. The two senators were talking about federal income taxes, and we decided we should check to see if Sanders’ claim is accurate. In the context of his debate with Graham, the implication is that if it weren't for special deals in the tax code, these companies would be writing checks to the Internal Revenue Service. Sanders' office pointed us to a Government Accountability Office study from 2008. The GAO conducts analysis for Congress. In one sense, that study found that Sanders understated the situation. For all corporations, about two-thirds, or about 1.2 million, paid no federal income taxes in 2005. But many of those firms are quite small -- an owner and a couple of employees. For large U.S.-controlled corporations, those with at least $250 million in assets or $50 million in gross receipts, one out of four paid no taxes, as Sanders said. The total revenues for those large companies was about $1.08 trillion. That, however, is not the end of the story. Why they owe no taxes We will focus on the large corporations because those seemed to be the ones Sanders had in mind. The GAO study found that 80 percent of those firms reported no income at the point in their tax return when they subtracted salaries and wages and took other deductions. That is, they showed a gross profit based on selling items for more than it cost to produce them, but they had additional expenses after that, such as payroll and tax deductions, which drove their taxable income to zero. The GAO lumped together firms that paid no taxes because they failed to turn a profit and those that were profitable but used additional wrinkles in the tax code to avoid paying the government. Distinguishing between those two groups sheds light on the situation. Citizens for Tax Justice is a research group that has as one of its goals ""requiring the wealthy to pay their fair share."" It has written in defense of Sanders’ positions before, but its most recent study of corporate tax payments suggests that the one-in-four statistic might be less significant than it seems. Steve Wamhoff, the group’s legislative director, said their 2011 report started with the Fortune 500 companies and culled the ones that met two criteria: they had three consecutive years of profitability from 2008 to 2010, and they provided enough information to do an accurate analysis. Of the 500, 220 did not meet those standards. With some notable exceptions, such as Google and Microsoft, the primary reason those 220 companies fell off the list was they had real losses. ""We get the fact that if you have profits one year but not the next year, you would carry your losses forward,"" Wamhoff said. ""We get that, but if you’ve been profitable for three years straight, those are the ones who really should be paying taxes."" Of the 280 consistently profitable corporations that remained, the study found that 22 paid no taxes in 2008, 49 paid none in 2009, and 37 paid none in 2010. Across all three years, there were 30 corporations that had a tax rate of zero or even a negative rate. The negative rate meant they might get a rebate check from Washington or have a tax credit they could apply to future earnings. Many familiar names show up in this list, such as Wells Fargo, Boeing, Verizon and General Electric. In the study’s three-year span, those 30 companies had pre-tax profits of about $160 billion, but their direct contribution to the federal treasury was zero. Citizens for Tax Justice pointed the finger at the rules for accelerated depreciation and stock options. The report said these and various other deductions allowed the firms to avoid hefty tax bills. However, those policy matters fall outside the scope of this fact check. A lack of profits tends to reduce the tax bill For fact-checking purposes, the Citizens for Tax Justice findings are interesting for another reason. If pre-tax losses explain why a large number of firms would not owe the government money, then the meaning of Sanders’ claim begins to look quite different. We would not expect a firm without profits to pay taxes. The GAO study did not probe this deeply. The Citizens for Tax Justice did, albeit for a smaller group of corporations. In rough terms, out of the original 500 corporations, 220 or about 40 percent were dealing with losses. The study found 78 consitently profitable companies, or about 15 percent of the original 500, that paid no taxes in at least one year. That is less than one out of four; it’s closer to one out of six. If we look at the 30 that paid nothing in any year, the ratio drops to one out of 16. Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, generally seen as a centrist think tank, cautions against reading too much into the 2008 GAO study. In a blog post written shortly after it was released, he called it ""interesting and suggestive, though also not conclusive."" Toder noted that most corporations are quite small with gross receipts of less than $250,000. They report no income because the money turns up as paychecks to the owner and employers where it is subject to the individual income tax. He agreed that some large corporations use ""aggressive techniques to shift reported profits to low-tax jurisdictions,"" but even those end up paying some U.S. taxes. Toder’s bottom line on the one out of four statistic? ""Whatever the technical factual basis of the statement, it isn’t terribly meaningful or revealing."" William McBride, chief economist at the Tax Foundation, a group that promotes lower taxes, finds Sanders’ ratio ""misleading."" McBride, as do the other analysts we contacted, pointed to the costs of doing business. His list included salaries and wages, interest, depreciation, rent and other taxes. ""You cannot legitimately deny these businesses these write-offs,"" McBride said. Our ruling Sanders said that one out of four corporations doesn’t pay a nickel in taxes. The statement reflects a 2008 study from the Government Accountability Office. However, the GAO study did not distinguish between firms that had losses in the normal course of business and those that reported losses solely through the use of the tax code. Groups along the political spectrum give much weight to the costs of doing business that can lead to a bad year. There is wide agreement that losses in one year can be carried forward and that salaries are an unavoidable expense, to mention just two factors. Special tax breaks and abuses of the tax code exist but even an analysis from a group that shares many of Sanders’ perspectives pointed to a ratio that was, at most, one out of six and possibly as small as one out of 16. The one out of four statistic fails to take into account many relevant factors. We rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/26/bernie-sanders/sanders-one-out-four-corporations-pay-no-taxes/

Ted Cruz says policy change by UPS left employees’ spouses “without health insurance”
","During his marathon Senate floor speech opposing President Barack Obama’s health care law, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, cited an example of an employer cutting back on health coverage as a result of the law. Cruz said: ""Just a few weeks ago, UPS sent a letter to some 15,000 employees saying, ‘We are dropping spousal health insurance because of Obamacare.’ That is 15,000 UPS employees who had insurance for their husbands and wives, and suddenly those husbands and wives are left without health insurance and being told, ‘Go on an exchange with no employer subsidy.’ "" We thought we’d check exactly what UPS, the major package carrier, did with its health insurance coverage. The full memo announcing the decision can be found here. Here are the key elements: • If a UPS employee is on the company’s plan and their spouse is employed at a different company that offers health insurance, the spouse will no longer be eligible for the UPS plan and must purchase insurance from their own employer. • If a UPS employee is on the company’s plan and their spouse is not employed by a company that offers health insurance (or isn’t employed at all, or is on a government plan such as Medicare), then the spouse will remain on the UPS plan. • The company estimates that of the 77,000 UPS employees who are enrolled in UPS health insurance, about 33,000 currently have spouses enrolled in the plan. Of those, the company estimates that 15,000 current UPS spousal enrollees may have to take their employer’s coverage -- roughly one in five of all enrollees. • Spouses whose employers offer medical insurance but do not offer prescription drug coverage or behavioral health benefits will not be allowed to remain on the UPS plan. • After the change, if a spouse shifts from being unemployed (and thus eligible for the UPS plan) to a job with insurance coverage, they must drop the UPS coverage and take their new employer’s coverage. • Children may remain on the UPS plan. If both parents have plans from different companies, the parents can choose which plan will cover their children. Stepchildren who are children of a spouse being removed from the UPS plan may remain on the UPS plan. • The UPS memo specifically cited Obamacare as a factor in its decision: ""Limiting plan eligibility is one way to manage ongoing health care costs. … This change is consistent with the way many large employers are responding to the costs associated with the health care reform legislation."" So UPS did change its policy on insuring spouses of employees, a change that will affect an estimated 15,000 people. But Cruz is wrong that the UPS spouses would be ""without health insurance"" and would have to ""go on an exchange with no employer subsidy."" In reality, the only spouses that would be removed from the UPS plan would be those that already had an option of purchasing employer coverage. They wouldn’t be without health insurance. They wouldn’t have to go on an Obamacare exchange. And their employer would be paying part of their premiums. Our ruling Cruz said that by dropping spousal health insurance for 15,000 employees, UPS left employees’ spouses ""without health insurance"" and told them to, ""go on an exchange with no employer subsidy."" But Cruz ignores that the only spouses being kicked off the UPS plan would be the ones who already had access to an employer-sponsored plan in their own job. This means they wouldn’t be ""without health insurance"" and wouldn’t have to find coverage on an Obamacare marketplace.

Obamacare ""has never been favored by a majority of Americans,"" Gingrich says
","U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, made waves this week with his 21-hour Senate speech against Obamacare. While he’s the only one reading Green Eggs and Ham to his colleagues as a form of protest, he’s far from alone in his criticism of the law. CNN Crossfire host Newt Gingrich referenced public opinion on the Sept. 24, 2013, show while criticizing President Barack Obama’s health care reform. ""It is a bill which has never once had a majority of Americans favor it,"" he said. Gingrich’s claim comes while Congress evaluates Republican-written legislation that proposes funding the government only if Obamacare is defunded. We looked at a similar claim in 2011, but it’s time to dive into the polls again. Since the Affordable Care Act was drafted in 2009, the poll numbers have been more or less consistent across different months and polling organizations: The approval rating has hovered around 40 percent recently, with about 50 percent disapproval and 10 percent no opinion. Not much has changed since then, according to a recent CNN and ORC report of all their Obamacare polling. That’s consistent with Gallup and other polling agencies. As best as we can tell, a credible poll has never turned up a figure over 50 percent. Bigger picture Gingrich was onto something with the poll results, confirmed Larry Jacobs, a University of Minnesota professor who specializes in public opinion and polling. ""It’s one of those things where when you look at the number of polling organizations, the variety of question wordings, I consider that an impressive finding and a robust one,"" Jacobs said. However, there’s a disconnect between the poll results themselves and Gingrich’s implication that most Americans don’t want Obamacare, Jacobs added. Although the poll results are consistent with each other, they produce lower favorability ratings than polls about health care reform that refer to the ""Affordable Care Act"" as opposed to ""Obamacare,"" according to CNBC. That’s because using the president’s name in a poll is ""more likely to invoke a partisan prism for evaluation,"" said Michael Traugott, a University of Michigan professor who specializes in public opinion and polling. In those studies that ask more generally about health care reform, Republicans respond more favorably. When pollsters ask the public about individual elements of Obamacare, like coverage for pre-existing conditions, the majority favors them, Traugott said. The main exception to this rule is the individual mandate. Another caveat to the poll results Gingrich references is the fact that a sizable segment of the public is misinformed or uninformed about the details of Obamacare. In fact, four in 10 polled by the Kaiser Family Foundation in April were unaware that the Affordable Care Act is still law. So many people indicate that they don’t favor Obamacare not because they don’t agree with the policy, but because they don’t understand the policy. ""Low levels of knowledge about the details of the legislation make it unlikely that there would be widespread support for it,"" Traugott said. Our ruling Gingrich claimed that Obamacare has never been supported by a majority of the nation. The polls themselves show that yes, approval has hovered around 40 percent for the past few years. But Gingrich eliminates the context of other polls, which show that a majority of people do approve of individual components of Obamacare. Because the statement needs clarification or additional information, we rate his claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5247c883-0e44-4a72-960c-aeb0178d3048",/factchecks/2013/sep/26/newt-gingrich/obamacare-has-never-been-favored-majority-american/

Terry McAuliffe says Ken Cuccinelli tried to make it harder for moms to get divorces
","Editors Note: On Sept. 16, PolitiFact Virginia rated as Mostly False a statement by Terry McAuliffe’s campaign  that Ken Cuccinelli wants to make it more difficult for mothers to get divorces. After reconsidering the evidence available, we’ve decided to change the rating to Half True, which means the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of conext.    Terry McAuliffe, Democratic Party gubernatorial candidate, turned to divorce law this month in his ongoing effort to portray Republican Ken Cuccinelli as insensitive to women. Here’s the text of a TV ad McAuliffe launched on Sept. 4 that contains a picture of a woman pushing two young children on swings: ""2008. Ken Cuccinelli writes a bill to give Virginia among the most extreme divorce laws in America. If Cuccinelli had it his way, a mom trying to get out of a bad marriage, over her husband’s objections, could only get divorced if she could prove adultery or physical abuse or her spouse had abandoned her or was sentenced to jail.  Why is Ken Cuccinelli interfering in our private lives?  He’s focused on his own agenda. Not us."" The ad follows a series of McAuliffe claims that Cuccinelli has sought to limit access to abortion and birth control. We wondered whether Cuccinelli really did introduce legislation aimed at making it harder for moms to end bad marriages. Let’s start with a quick primer on Virginia’s divorce laws. The grounds for ending a marriage include adultery, felony conviction, cruelty or fear of bodily harm, wilful desertion and voluntary separation of 12 months when there are minor children or six months when there are no minor children and a property agreement exists. Even when other grounds exist, couples often use the separation rule so they can obtain a so-called ""no-fault"" divorce, according to Edward Barnes, president of Barnes & Diehl, a family law firm. He said the process ends up being a little less expensive and neither party is blamed for the divorce in a final decree, which is among the paperwork available as public records. And if there’s been adultery or other grounds for ending a marriage, the no-fault grounds can be used as a bargaining chip in divorce proceedings by the innocent party. ""I think a lot of lawyers will think in terms of benefit to the children,"" Barnes said. ""There will not be an adultery decree that could be waved around later to hurt the children."" All states have unilateral no-fault divorce grounds, although they vary greatly in the separation time frame required. Cuccinelli, as a state senator in 2008, introduced legislation that would have eliminated the ability for a spouse in a couple with minor children to unilaterally file for divorce under the separation ground. The bill would have allowed the other spouse to block the process by filing a written objection. The legislation died in the Senate Courts of Justice Committee. Cuccinelli explained his support for tougher divorce laws in 2007 and 2009 campaign statements. ""Studies show that the dissolution of marriage has long term negative impacts on children and those marriages that last for five years are much more likely to go the distance,"" he wrote. ""For this reason, the state has an interest in marital preservation. I support family law reform that establishes mutual consent divorce and requires counseling where children are involved, unless abuse is involved."" McAuliffe’s TV ad suggests Cuccinelli’s 2008 bill would have weakened the options of moms seeking divorce and strengthened the hand of dads. McAuliffe’s campaign backed that message sending us links of columns from a conservative father’s rights groups supporting tightening divorce rules and from the Pennsylvania chapter of the National Organization for Women defending the no-fault divorce rules in that state. Neither article addressed Virginia law, Cuccinelli’s bill, or laid out specific arguments that no-fault divorce is more advantageous to mothers than fathers. The father’s group contended that children are best-served by being raised in a household with both of their parents; NOW said it is traumatic for children to remain in homes with dysfunctional marriages. Barnes, while no fan of Cuccinelli’s bill, said it’s misleading for McAuliffe to portray it as aimed against mothers. ""It’s gender neutral. Neither side can remarry. Both sides, if they’re living apart, can’t files tax returns as a couple and that costs them."" Our ruling  McAuliffe’s ad says Cuccinelli introduced legislation in 2008 that would have made it more difficult for mothers to obtain divorces. Cuccinelli’s unsuccessful bill would have eliminated the ability for a spouse in a couple with minor children to unilaterally file for a no-fault divorce. The legislation would have allowed the other spouse to block the process by filing a written objection. In portraying the bill as an attack on women, McAuliffe ignores that the legislation would have made it equally more difficult for dads to get divorces. So McAuliffe’s statement has accuracy, but leaves out an important detail and context. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/26/terry-mcauliffe/terry-mcauliffe-says-ken-cuccinelli-tried-make-it-/
