Did Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore take $1 million from a charity he ran?
","Correction: When we originally reported this fact-check on Sept. 1, we were unable to determine how the Senate Leadership Fund arrived at its figure of ""over $1 million,"" and the group didn’t respond to our query. The evidence seemed to show a total of under $1 million for salary and other benefits. After publication, a spokesman for the group provided additional evidence showing Moore received compensation as a consultant and through an amended filing, bringing the total to more than $1 million. We have corrected our report, and we have changed the rating from Mostly False to Mostly True. An attack ad targeting Roy Moore, a Republican candidate in the Alabama Senate special election, claims that he and his wife Kayla Moore paid themselves $1 million from a nonprofit organization they ran. The ad, funded by the Senate Leadership Fund, also creates the impression Moore drew compensation from the organization, The Foundation for Moral Law, while sitting on the Alabama Supreme Court. ""Despite being one of the highest paid judges in the nation (...) Roy Moore wanted more,"" the advertisement said. ""So Roy Moore and his wife (paid themselves) over $1 million from a charity they ran."" Moore will face Sen. Luther Strange in a Sept. 26 runoff vote for the Republican nomination to fill the senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general. Strange, who’s backed by the Senate Leadership Fund, was tapped to fill Sessions’ seat ahead of the Dec. 12 general election. The Senate Leadership Fund is aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. We decided to investigate the Senate Leadership Fund’s claim that the Moore family drew over $1 million from The Foundation for Moral Law. The stated mission of The Foundation for Moral Law, founded in 2002, is to ""educate the public and promote current litigation aimed at moral and religious issues,"" according to its website. In practice, the group writes friend-of-the-court briefs that advocate a Christian point of view in legal cases involving abortion, gay marriage, public prayer and other litigation with potential to ""restore the knowledge of God in law."" The group’s ethos aligns with Moore’s controversial judicial career, which includes being forced out as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court in 2003 for defying a federal court order to remove the Ten Commandments from the courthouse grounds. Moore was elected again to the Alabama Supreme Court in 2013 and was suspended in 2016 after he directed Alabama’s probate judges to defy federal court orders on same-sex marriage. He resigned the following year. The IRS granted The Foundation for Moral Law tax-exempt status in 2005, and that same year Moore was listed in IRS filings as the foundation’s chairman. Moore served as either chairman or president from 2005 through 2012, and his wife Kayla Moore took over as president in 2013. The attack ad claims it was during this 9-year period — from 2005 through 2013 — that the Moore family drew $1,030,875 in compensation (but as the screengrab shows, this time frame appears inconspicuously and in very fine print, perhaps to create the impression the Moores were paid in a single lump sum, when in fact their compensation was spread over nearly a decade).  As the breakdown below shows, the Moore family did in fact receive $1,030,875 from The Foundation for Moral Law over this period, according to IRS filings: Form 990 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 ‘13 Roy Moore 9,983 0 105,500 (Legal consulting) 55,392 72,000 (Amended filing) 90,000 60,000 (Salary) 393,000 (Retirement and other deferred compensation) 138,000 42,000 N/A Kayla Moore N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 65,000 The ad also creates the impression Moore drew compensation from The Foundation for Moral Law while serving as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, a position he began in 2001. Moore was kicked off the bench in 2003 for refusing to comply with a federal court order to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments from the rotunda of the state Supreme Court building. He began to draw a salary from the foundation in 2005, two years after his dismissal from the bench, according to the foundation’s IRS filings. So the suggestion he drew the two salaries concurrently is wrong. Senate Leadership Fund attack ad said, ""Roy Moore and his wife (paid themselves) over $1 million from a charity they ran."" From 2005 through 2013, the Moore family drew $1,030,875 from The Foundation for Moral Law. But the ad gave the wrong impression that Moore took a salary from the nonprofit while serving as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court.  We rate this Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC96CB00>],/factchecks/2017/sep/05/senate-leadership-fund/did-roy-moore-take-1-million-charity-he-ran/
"['Immigration', 'Illinois', 'Bruce Rauner']","
Immigrant tale twists branches of Bruce Rauner's family tree
","Bruce Rauner clearly idolized his maternal grandparents, Clarence and Viola Erickson. From his earliest days in politics, he has repeatedly invoked their memory as role models for the kind of selfless, rugged and generous person that he hoped voters would find him to be. It was of little surprise then that, as he appeared with immigrant activists to sign a controversial law putting limits on policing of the undocumented, Rauner retold his own favorite story of immigrants -- the Ericksons from Sweden. ""My grandparents were proud immigrants to the United States of America, here to Illinois in the late 1800s,"" Rauner said. ""My grandparents did not speak English when they were young."" Variations of the Erickson story have been staples of Rauner appearances for years. But the key word here is ""variations,"" because the governor has not always been consistent in the telling. So what is the real immigrant story of those grandparents Rauner is always talking about? We decided to check. First, a little context. Bruce Rauner grew up in the upscale North Shore suburbs of Deerfield and Lake Forest as well as Scottsdale, Ariz., and his father was a high-ranking executive at electronics giant Motorola. Rauner went to Ivy League colleges, became enormously wealthy as a private equity investor and was the owner of nine luxury homes and ranches when he launched his campaign.   His campaign was clearly sensitive to how that might play with voters as it sought from the first to portray him as a regular guy. Early campaign ads featured Rauner with his $18 Timex watch and a two-decade old family van that he said his children dubbed the ""rolling trash can."" The Chicago Tribune asked in 2014 about comparisons to wealthy private equity investor turned politician Mitt Romney, and Rauner bristled: ""He came across as a blue blood, I'm a regular guy. I drink beer. I don't drink Courvoisier or whatever the hell that stuff is. I drink beer and I smoke a cigar and I ride a Harley and I love to fish."" Cue the Ericksons as a key component of Rauner’s down-to-earth cred. Here’s the story as highlighted on Rauner’s campaign website: ""Bruce’s grandfather was a Swedish-speaking, small-town dairyman who taught Bruce about fishing and hunting, the value of hard work and the importance of giving back."" And here is how Rauner described his grandfather during a campaign stop in Wauconda in October 2013: ""My best friend growing up was my grandfather on my mom’s side. Swedish immigrant. Didn’t speak much English. Lived in a double wide trailer in a cornfield outside Whitewater, Wisconsin. Dairy farmer. Taught me to milk cows. Taught me about huntin’ and fishin.’ Taught me about hard work and giving back."" A year later, he was quoted in the Pekin Daily Times this way: ""America's built on immigration, my grandparents were immigrants, and I would like to see us a welcoming state for immigrants from all over the world."" More recently, when Rauner was interviewed in June 2017 by the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University, he again talked of his grandfather. ""He was my best buddy growing up. He was an immigrant, didn't speak much English. He spoke Swedish,"" Rauner said. And he also said this on Aug. 11, 2017, in an interview with Bret Baier on the Fox News Channel: ""Illinois is a state built by immigrants. My grandparents were immigrants."" A few weeks later, as he addressed the crowd at the high-profile signing event for the Illinois Trust Act on Aug. 28, he expanded on his grandparents’ narrative, adding that they came to this country ""in the late 1800s"" and ""did not speak English when they were young."" Notice the difference? When Rauner talks off the cuff about his grandparents, they are immigrants challenged by English. But when Rauner’s official website describes Grandpa Erickson, there’s no mention of him being an immigrant. He spoke Swedish, the website stressed, but that hardly means he didn’t also speak English. And there may be a good reason for the parsing. Records from U.S. Censuses taken between 1910 and 1940, the latest year publicly available, clearly show that both of Rauner’s maternal grandparents were born in Wisconsin — Clarence Erickson in 1901 and Viola Erickson (nee Wedin) in 1900.  In other words, neither of them were immigrants. What’s more, the census shows that Viola’s mother — Rauner’s great-grandmother — was also born in Wisconsin. Viola’s father, while born in Sweden, emigrated to the U.S. at age 6 in 1868. As for Clarence, the census describes him as speaking English and having a seventh grade education. In the 1940 count, his profession was listed as ""buttermaker."" In Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain called them stretchers -- engaging stories that don’t meet the smell test. Politicians who spin engaging personal narratives can be artful practitioners of the stretcher. Here in Illinois, former U. S. Sen. Mark Kirk often inflated his resume, exaggerating the importance of jobs he held, his educational background and military service. Most famously, Kirk overly dramatized details of a Lake Michigan boating accident and rescue that he claimed altered his life and led him to commit to public service. Former Gov. Rod Blagojevich used to place himself at the center of an ""ah shucks"" story about being mistaken for former Mayor Richard Daley. Depending on Blagojevich’s audience, the mix-up occurred on a busy Loop street, or at a memorial service for a prominent businessman, or on his way to the airport. The only thing clear about the story was that it always got a laugh. Rauner’s grandparents’ story has elements of that genre. No one expects children to have more than a hazy grasp of details about what came before them in the family, and Rauner was just a boy when those close bonds with his grandparents were formed. So it’s tempting to cut his memories some slack. Except for this: Rauner the adult knows that his grandparents weren’t immigrants and admitted as much in a 2014 interview with reporters from the Tribune. ""My great grandparents came to this country, it was my great-grandparents, and my grandparents grew up with them in Wisconsin speaking Swedish,"" Rauner said. ""They were born to immigrants."" Bruce Rauner said his grandparents were immigrants from Sweden who came to the U.S. ""in the late 1800s."" We have no reason to doubt that Rauner’s grandparents meant the world to him. But the Census plainly refutes his claim that they were immigrants. What’s more, both couldn’t have come to the U.S. in the late 1800s because they weren’t even born until the early 1900s — in Wisconsin, not Sweden. Rauner’s assertion in August that his grandparents immigrated to Illinois is yet another inaccuracy. Since we don’t have a time machine, we can’t say for certain what language was spoken in the Erickson and Wedin childhood homes. But to the extent that Rauner implies the Ericksons' facility with English was limited, Census reports refute that notion as well. Topping all that is the acknowledgement by Rauner himself in his 2014 Tribune interview that his grandparents were not immigrants. Still, he continued to repeat the claim on many occasions. Census records and Rauner’s own admission show that this statement has no credibility. That is why it earns our lowest possible rating, Pants On Fire.    ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7A9100>],/factchecks/2017/sep/05/bruce-rauner/rauner-trims-twists-branches-his-family-tree-immig/

Internet rumor about Navy destroyer hitting Houston building isn’t anchored in reality
","A fake news story that said a U.S. Navy vessel collided with a building in downtown Houston after flooding from Hurricane Harvey is actually from a website that parodies military news. ""Unbelievable: Navy destroyer strikes a building in downtown Houston,"" reads the headline on a Sept. 1, 2017, post on AmericanNews.com. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. ""The city of Houston has already seen enough tragedy due to the catastrophic flooding from Hurricane Harvey, and unfortunately things took a turn for the worst today when a U.S. Navy ship collided with a building in the downtown area,"" the post read. The story, which was posted after Hurricane Harvey struck coastal Texas with record amounts of rain, noted it was unclear why the destroyer was 20 miles inland or how it struck an unidentified skyscraper (although it looks like the Heritage Plaza building). That’s because the entire incident is fake.   The story originated Aug. 29 on DuffelBlog.com, a site that posts satirical articles skewed to a military audience. For example, the site had a story that said the U.S. Army plans to move the entire South Korean capital of Seoul 300 miles south to ease tensions with the North. Another said the Navy plans to save money by giving up trying to rescue sailors who fall overboard. DuffelBlog.com’s disclaimer telegraphs its intent to resemble the satirical news website The Onion, and indicates its content is fake. ""We are in no way, shape, or form, a real news outlet. Everything on this website is satirical and the content of this site is a parody of a news organization,"" the disclaimer reads. The photo in the post about Hurricane Harvey and the Navy destroyer does show the Houston skyline, but the image is a composite of a snapshot from a blog showing flooding in 2015 and a real destroyer, the USS Mustin. You can see the name written backward on the hull of the ship. In case you were wondering, the Mustin was not anywhere near Houston or the Gulf of Mexico. According to the ship’s Facebook page, the destroyer is part of the Seventh Fleet and is stationed in Japan.

Celebrity donations of tens of millions of dollars to Harvey victims are fake news
","Three similarly worded posts published on News360-tv.com said Manny Pacquiao, Usain Bolt and Princes William and Harry had each donated tens of millions of dollars to Hurricane Harvey victims. They haven’t. Pacquiao, a Filipino boxer and politician, was said to have spent $50 million to rebuild Houston. Princes Harry and William were said to have given $100 million to assist and house victims of the flood. And Bolt, an Olympic sprinter, was said to have spent a whopping $150 million on hurricane relief. While other celebrities are indeed pledging thousands to the cause, these magnanimous donations haven’t been reported on any credible news sites, and the celebrities have not made any such announcements on social media. The stories about Bolt and Pacquiao used almost the exact same wording as a story we’ve already debunked claiming boxer Floyd Mayweather donated $200 million for hurricane relief. They each started with the quip ""To whom much is given, much is expected."" They also falsely claimed the athletes had traveled to Houston and attributed the same quotes to each. ""It is a humanitarian gesture, an act of solidarity and support for a brotherly affected people,"" the stories attributed to Bolt, Pacquiao and Mayweather all say.

The Black Lives Matter protest outside a Philly police officer’s home was not ‘illegal occupation'
","Since Black Lives Matter protesters rallied last week outside the home of the Philadelphia Police officer who shot and killed David Jones, several politicians and local leaders have jumped in to defend the officer and condemn BLM’s actions. Among the strongest voices speaking out against the Black Lives Matter protesters has been Pa. Rep. Martina White. She gave a statement to the Northeast Times this week saying, ""It is shocking to me that Police Commissioner Richard Ross and Mayor Jim Kenney allowed this illegal occupation to go on for hours without taking any action to enforce the law, and I question whether the police department has been ordered to stand down when it comes to addressing this Black Lives Matter action.""   We zeroed in on the phrase ""illegal occupation."" Did the BLM protesters, who did not have a permit, commit an illegal act outside officer Ryan Pownall’s home? Asked why White believed the protesters were illegally occupying the area, spokesperson David Foster told PolitiFact PA it was because they lacked a permit and harassed the neighbors. He also offered up the same statement given to the Northeast Times. The protesters kept video of the rally, found on leader Asa Khalif’s public Facebook page. In it, you can see 30 minutes of footage during which a handful of protesters walk back and forth between the street and sidewalks, shouting anti-police remarks on a bullhorn. Throughout the protest, the street and sidewalks mostly remain clear. The protesters did not at any point band together in an attempt to block traffic. However, a police vehicle was parked in the middle of the street for some time. ACLU PA deputy legal director Mary Catherine Roper said Black Lives Matter did nothing illegal. Philadelphia requires permits for demonstrations of 75 people or more and for protests that occur on city streets or sidewalks ""without compliance with the normal and customary traffic regulations or controls governing such places."" Roper said the protest outside of Pownall’s home was too small to require a permit and didn’t clash with the other required criterion, given the protesters weren’t preventing others from using the sidewalks or the street.   ""The representative needs to brush up on the law if she’s going to make comments like that,"" Roper said, ""which are simply not accurate."" Lauren Hitt, communications director for Mayor Jim Kenney, said a protest of this size did not need to apply for a permit. Some court cases have restricted the rights of protesters in residential areas, such as Klebanoff v. McMonagle in 1988 in the Pennsylvania Superior Court. The judges upheld an injunction against dozens of pro-life protesters who had repeatedly rallied in front of an abortion doctor’s home. But the decision didn’t outwardly ban protesting in residential areas. Roper said the BLM protesters were within their rights given their size and the way they walked around the streets and sidewalks rather than camping out directly in front of Pownall’s home. The 7th District police, which preside over the Bustleton neighborhood where Pownall lives, did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did BLM’s Khalif. Our ruling White said protesters rallying outside the home of Pownall, who shot and killed Jones, were engaged in an ""illegal occupation."" The protesters, which numbered no more than 10, had not applied for a permit. But Philadelphia doesn’t require demonstrations featuring less than 75 people to apply for permits. The protesters were also not blocking the streets or the sidewalks of the neighborhood, actions that would also call for a permit.    We rule the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEF9400>],/factchecks/2017/sep/01/martina-white/why-black-lives-matter-protest-outside-philly-poli/

Paul Ryan's misleading claim about a single mom, not Aaron Rodgers, paying the highest tax rate
","A Dominican nun took the microphone at a CNN town hall in Racine, Wis. with U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, noted that they are both Catholics, and said to him: I’d like to ask you how you see yourself upholding the church’s social teaching that has the idea that God is always on the side of the poor and dispossessed. The Janesville Republican responded, in part, by referring to the Green Bay Packers’ star quarterback -- and arguing that welfare programs need to be reformed so that they don’t discourage work. Alluding to high tax rates he had criticized earlier in the Aug. 21, 2017 forum, Ryan said: I was telling you about these successful small businesses in Wisconsin -- they’ve got a 44.6 percent tax rate. That’s not the highest tax rate payer. I mean, Aaron Rodgers -- who deserves every salary -- is not the highest tax rate payer in this state. You know who it is? It’s the single mom getting 24 grand in benefits with two kids who would lose 80 cents on the dollar if she goes and takes a job. We have to fix that. Ryan essentially repeated the claim three days later while visiting Boeing in Washington State, comparing the aerospace giant and its corporate tax rate to the same single mother. He has also made nearly the same claim in the past, including at least twice in 2016. An unemployed single parent on public assistance who takes a job doesn’t suddenly start paying an income tax rate of 80 percent. And though Ryan has a point, the example he gives is rare, not common. Tax rates For 2017, Rodgers’ contract with the Packers pays him a base salary of $12.55 million. That alone puts him in the income brackets with the highest tax rates: 7.65 percent for Wisconsin, which applies to taxable incomes over $244,750 39.6 percent for federal, for taxable incomes of $418,401 and over That means Rodgers’ marginal rate -- the amount paid on the last dollar of income -- is a total rate of 47.25 percent. (The state rate plus the federal one.) So, what happens to the unemployed single mother, in Ryan’s scenario, who takes a job? Marginal tax rates Ryan spokesman Ian Martorana told us Ryan’s reference was not to the income tax rate paid by the single mother, but rather her effective marginal tax rate -- which takes into account public benefits that are lost as a result of an increase in income. Think of losing benefits as a result of taking a job as a tax. Ryan argues that by taking a job, the woman in his example would lose 80 cents in benefits for every $1 in income earned from taking a job. That would be a marginal tax rate of 80 percent. Experts told us that wouldn’t be the highest marginal tax rate anyone pays, but it would be among the highest. The problem is, Ryan’s statement suggests the 80 percent rate is relatively common. Experts told us it’s possible, but very rare, that a single unemployed parent could collect $24,000 a year in public benefits. She likely would need to receive relatively uncommon housing assistance in addition to food stamps, Medicaid and other benefits. The experts also said such a person would be hit with what amounts to an 80 percent tax rate only if she takes a job within a narrow income range above the poverty level -- not, for example, if the job pays minimum wage. A 2015 research paper Ryan’s office cited to us from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office does not provide marginal tax rates for a single parent like the one Ryan described. However, for a single parent with one child -- and only within a narrow income range -- the marginal tax rate for 2016 averaged 75 percent Another source cited by Ryan, 2015 testimony to Congress from the nonprofit Urban Institute, also said marginal tax rates can reach 75 percent. But that occurs among relatively few people -- poverty-level workers who not only receive benefits such as food stamps and health insurance, but much less common housing assistance, and then begin earning higher incomes within a narrow range above the poverty level. In contrast, an unemployed person who takes a job would almost never face an 80 percent marginal tax rate, experts told us. That’s because while a newly employed person might lose some benefits by becoming employed, she would gain benefits from earned income and child care tax credits that come with taking a job. Other data For example, in a 2014 paper, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, argued that a single mother of two is better off by taking a job, even if it pays only $12,000 per year. She would lose some food stamps and have to pay income taxes. But by gaining the earned income and child tax credits, ""that $12,000 job leads to a $16,630 increase in income,"" according to the paper.   Only in narrow circumstances -- with an income of less than $29,000 and receiving ""an unusual combination of government benefits"" -- would the marginal tax rate for a single mother of two exceed 80 percent, according to a 2016 paper by the center. ""In the overwhelming majority of cases, in fact, adults in poverty are significantly better off if they get a job, work more hours, or receive a wage hike,"" that paper said. At the same time, even if marginal tax rates don’t reach 80 percent for most lower-income people, they are perceived as a problem. The paper from the nonpartisan CBO says ""when marginal tax rates are high, people tend to respond to the smaller financial gain from employment by working fewer hours, altering the intensity of their work, or not working at all."" And Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance president Todd Berry told us: ""It is a real problem for anyone moving up the income scale from poverty, because so many of these programs are income-conditioned. The main point to be made here is how these programs are designed can create powerful disincentives"" to work. Our rating Ryan says Aaron Rodgers ""is not the highest tax rate payer"" in Wisconsin, it's ""the single mom getting 24 grand in benefits with two kids who will lose 80 cents on the dollar if she goes and takes a job."" There’s some mixing of apples and oranges here. The reference to Rodgers is for the actual highest rate he would pay for income taxes. With regard to the single mother, Ryan is referring to her marginal tax rate -- how much in public benefits she would lose by taking a job. Ryan is correct that it’s possible for the woman he describes to lose 80 cents in benefits for every $1 in income earned -- an 80 percent marginal tax rate. But that occurs in very rare cases where the mother would be receiving a higher than typical set of public benefits and would take a job within a narrow income range above the poverty level. The vast majority of lower income people aren’t hit with a marginal tax rate as high as 80 percent, although even lower rates are considered strong disincentives to work. And advocates for the poor say the unemployed generally are better off financially by taking a job, even if they lose some public assistance. For a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.  Ryan had been under criticism for not holding town halls in his southern Wisconsin district that were open to the public. We rated as Mostly True a claim from Randy Bryce, a Democrat who is running for Ryan’s seat in 2018, that Ryan had not done a public town hall in the district for more than 600 days. Ryan had turned to telephone town halls and events held in workplaces, which had limited public access. The CNN event was something of a hybrid: members of the public could apply to CNN to attend, but it was not like a traditional town hall held in a public building that anyone could enter. In Racine, Ryan drew headlines for criticizing remarks made by President Donald Trump about racial violence nine days earlier in Charlottesville, Va. But a portion of the CNN town hall was spent discussing taxes.

Pants on Fire! Mike Pence cited Bible to oppose Hurricane Katrina relief bill, liberal bloggers say
","Left-leaning bloggers used the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey to attack Vice President Mike Pence, saying he opposed relief for Hurricane Katrina while he was a congressman. Many partisans and political groups pointed to a speech Pence gave on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2005, implying that Pence was going to be unwilling to help Houston-area residents affected by Harvey. One such example we saw took exception to the floor speech by calling Pence out for citing the Bible: ""Here's Pence quoting Matthew 7:25 while urging Congress not to fund Katrina relief effort. Can't get any more phony,"" @adamcbest tweeted on Aug. 29, 2017. Here's Pence quoting Matthew 7:25 while urging Congress not to fund Katrina relief effort. Can't get any more phony. pic.twitter.com/wiEPkhlI1a The admonition, which had been retweeted more than 13,000 times as of this writing, featured a video of Pence posted on Twitter by Scott Dworkin, the cofounder of the Democratic Coalition. Dworkin also posted the video on DailyKos.com. Most critics tended to especially focus on Pence’s line, ""Congress must ensure that a catastrophe of nature does not become a catastrophe of debt for our children and grandchildren."" Did Pence really cite the Bible while demanding that Congress not fund Katrina relief? Pence spoke in a one-minute speech on the House floor on Sept. 8, 2005, shortly after Katrina wreaked havoc on the Gulf Coast by making landfall near New Orleans on Aug. 29. The brevity of his remarks allows us to consider his statement in full: ""Mr. Speaker, Katrina breaks my heart. When I consider its tragic aftermath, the ancient parable comes to mind: ‘And the rains descended and the flood came and the winds blew and beat against the house and it fell with a great crash.’ ""For most American families, when a tree falls on your house, you tend to the wounded, you rebuild, and then you figure out how you are going to pay for it. Later today Congress will continue the work of funding the relief and recovery from Hurricane Katrina, and well we should, by speeding more than $50 billion to FEMA and other agencies. ""But as we tend to the wounded, as we begin to rebuild, let us also do what every other American family would do, in like circumstances, and expects this Congress to do: let us figure out how we’re going to pay for it. ""Congress must ensure that a catastrophe of nature does not become a catastrophe of debt for our children and grandchildren."" The parable to which he refers is a Bible verse, but it’s actually Matthew 7:27, not 7:25 as the tweet said. (The wording is very similar.) In context, the parable is about believing in the true God in the face of temptation or suffering, although here Pence is clearly playing off the idea of building on stable ground. While the tweet that’s been shared said Pence urged Congress not to approve Katrina aid, the video that accompanied the piece — and Pence’s full remarks — actually support the opposite conclusion. Pence did not oppose any aid for Katrina victims. He said in his remarks that Congress should pay for relief efforts. Pence joined the vast majority of lawmakers who voted later that same day in favor of a $51.8 billion relief package, which passed 410-11. The bill then passed the Senate 97-0 and was signed into law by President George W. Bush. What Pence was saying is that Congress should not go into debt to pay for the aid package, and find other solutions to offset costs. It’s no secret Pence is a fan of reducing government spending. As chairman of the Republican Study Group, a collection of very conservative legislators, Pence did propose cutting or delaying spending on some projects to offset the costs of rebuilding the Gulf Coast. Their plan was even called ""Operation Offset."" Among the group’s targets were a prescription drug benefit for seniors and transportation projects. But even as Pence and other congressional Republicans looked to find cuts to curtail a budget deficit, he did not propose holding up Katrina relief. He continued his cost-cutting rhetoric a couple of weeks later, when he discussed cutting ""big-ticket items"" from the budget to deal with Katrina spending.   Bloggers said a video showed Pence quoting the Bible as justification for ""Congress not to fund Katrina relief effort."" They cited a short 2005 floor speech in which Pence said Katrina relief should pass, but then Congress should look to cut costs elsewhere. He did not hold the aid bill hostage, even while making cost-cutting a personal priority. (The tweet we’re citing also was a bit off about which particular Bible verse he used.) Critics are misrepresenting Pence’s comments, which are plain just from watching the video. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC778A40>],/factchecks/2017/aug/31/blog-posting/mike-pence-cited-bible-oppose-katrina-relief-liber/

Donald Trump repeats false claim about illegal border crossings
","A border wall with Mexico is needed for security reasons, even though traffic coming through has stopped significantly, claimed President Donald Trump. Trump has threatened a government shutdown if Congress doesn’t pass a bill allocating funds for parts of his promised border wall, despite his campaign assurances that Mexico would pay for the costs. ""The wall is needed from the standpoint of security. The wall is needed from the standpoint of drugs -- tremendous, the drug scourge, what's coming through the areas that we're talking about,"" Trump said at an Aug. 28 press conference. ""As you know, I have General (John) Kelly here. We stopped traffic coming through, 78 percent. It's going to be, I think, 81 percent this quarter, which is a record."" Trump also claimed that during past administrations ""if they stopped it just a little bit, like 1 or 2 or 3 percent, they consider that a great thing. We're up to almost 80 percent."" Trump has made similar statements before about his administration’s control of the southwest border, using different timeframes to claim the greatest success. Has the Trump administration ""stopped traffic"" at the border by 78 percent? Not exactly. The most commonly used metric to gauge illegal immigration is border apprehensions, and the most recent data available do not support the claim. The White House did not provide information to support or clarify the president’s claim, despite our repeated requests. In past claims Trump has relied on year-over-year numbers, month-to-month data and the stretch from November 2016 (election month) to February. We compared the latest Border Patrol apprehension figures available (July 2017) to scenarios Trump has used before and did not find the 78 percent decline he claimed. U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows that in July 2017 there were 18,198 apprehensions at the southwest border. Here’s how the number of apprehensions have changed: • From July 2016 to July 2017, down 46 percent;​ • From June 2017 to July 2017, up 13 percent; • From November 2016 to July 2017, down 61 percent. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker has noted that apprehensions are close to an 80 percent decline by cherry-picking the highest point in fiscal year 2017 (November) to the lowest point (April). That yields a 76 percent decrease. At the press conference, Trump also commented about needing a U.S.-Mexico border wall to fight the drug trade. We wondered if Trump’s ""we stopped traffic coming through -- 78 percent"" claim might refer to drug seizures, but available data did not support that statement. Customs and Border Protection publishes data on pounds of drugs seized by both Border Patrol officers and the agency’s Office of Field Operations. The agency has information on pounds seized (cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine) during fiscal years 2015 and 2016, and year-to-date for fiscal year 2017 (up to July 31, 2017). But that specific information is not singled out as being just for the southwest border, and it is not broken down per month. The agency did not get back to us by deadline with those detailed numbers. Comparisons of pounds seized (for each type of drug) from fiscal year 2016 to year-to-date fiscal year 2017 do not show a 78 percent change, either. There was a 93 percent decline in the pounds of ecstasy seized by Border Patrol agents — 15 pounds in 2016, 1 pound in 2017 so far. Trump said, ""We stopped traffic coming through -- 78 percent."" Though Trump’s claim is vague, he’s made similar remarks about the border being ""down 78 percent"" and being ""close to 80 percent stoppage."" But the latest figures available for southwest border apprehensions do not support his claim. Only cherry-picked data would yield a 76 percent decline in apprehensions. Available information regarding drug seizures do not show a 78 percent decline, either.

Ted Cruz's Mostly False claim that two-thirds of Sandy relief was pork spending
","Hurricane Harvey’s torrential rains and flooding have revived memories of Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz’s nay vote on federal relief for superstorm Sandy. MSNBC host Katy Tur challenged Cruz to defend his vote then with his support for relief today. Cruz said he enthusiastically backed aid for Sandy’s victims, but the problem was the particular bill. ""It became a $50 billion bill that was filled with unrelated pork,"" Cruz said Aug. 28. ""Two-thirds of the bill had nothing to do with Sandy. And what I said then and still believe now is it's not right for politicians to exploit a disaster and people who are hurting, for them to pay for their own political wishlist."" Did two-thirds of the Sandy money have nothing to do with that storm? No. There was some padding, but the data and the assessment of those who studied the bill say the extras amounted to far less than Cruz stated. Cruz’s office sent us its breakout of the 2013 Disaster Relief Appropriations Act to support the assertion that ""nearly 70 percent"" was ""used for non-emergency spending."" Before we dive into a couple of the big items on that list, it’s important to note that Cruz said the bulk of the money had nothing to do with Sandy. That’s considerably stronger than saying the money went for ""non-emergency spending."" In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy devastated portions of the Mid-Atlantic coast. Congress responded by adding nearly $10 billion to the National Flood Insurance Program. It then passed a relief bill for five times that amount. The bigger package passed without the support of Cruz and most other Republicans. Of the $50.5 billion dollars that Congress appropriated, Cruz’s office cited a Congressional Quarterly article that said $17 billion went for ""immediate aid and $33.5 billion for near- and long-term assistance and mitigation."" The list from Cruz highlighted $16 billion to the Housing and Urban Development Department’s Community Development Fund. (The actual figure is $15.2 billion according to a spreadsheet from the Recovery and Accountability Board, the agency created to oversee recession recovery spending.) Cruz’s office said that included ""any major disaster declarations from 2011, 2012 and 2013."" While that might raise concern that the money would go elsewhere, in reality, the funds largely went to the states hit by Sandy. According to HUD, $12.8 billion has been granted to New Jersey, New York and New York City. Add in other east coast states where Sandy did damage -- Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island -- and the total reaches $13 billion. So you could argue that the bucket leaked, but not nearly on the scale flagged by Cruz’s office. The other large chunk of funds was $10.9 billion for mass transit reconstruction. That money has been slow to get out the door. The Recovery Board had just $3.7 billion granted and a bit under $1 billion spent as of March 2015. But that doesn’t prove that the money had nothing to do with Sandy. The Federal Transit Administration told state officials in 2013 that ""funds are for specific areas (counties) in 12 states designated as disaster areas for Hurricane Sandy."" The Government Accountability Office, the auditing arm of Congress, assessed the transit relief program in 2014. It said ""transit projects can take years to complete. Furthermore, Federal Transit Administration plans to use nearly half of its Disaster Relief Appropriations Act appropriation for resiliency projects (or projects to protect facilities from future damage)."" The GAO noted that the funding guidelines allow ""transit agencies to improve facilities beyond pre-disaster conditions."" This supports the criticism that the money would go beyond immediate disaster relief, but as the report noted, large-scale construction projects have long runways. Taken together, these two buckets of money account for about $24 billion of the $33 billion that was the basis for Cruz saying most of the money was unrelated to Sandy. Two people who analyze disaster relief spending said Cruz was off the mark. ""Two-thirds would be a gross overestimate,"" said Robert Young, a Western Carolina University geologist. ""There was clearly extraneous spending, but no way it was two-thirds."" The advocacy group Taxpayers for Common Sense assembled a body of data on spending related to Sandy. The group’s vice president Steve Ellis said no matter how you look at the numbers, two-thirds of the funds ""are definitely Sandy related."" Ellis said the bigger issue wasn’t pork barrel spending, rather that the bill passed outside of the regular budget process.   ""It really depends on how you think about emergency,"" Ellis said. ""Two years after Sandy only a fraction of the money had been spent. We would like to see a more deliberative approach to disaster rather than strike while the iron is hot."" Cruz said that two-thirds of Hurricane Sandy relief money had nothing to do with Sandy. The numbers don’t back that up. Cruz might have been focused on the difference between immediate emergency relief and longer term reconstruction, but his words skipped over that distinction. The data and the assessment of experts show that the bulk of the funds went to the places hit hardest by Sandy. There was a leaky bucket, but not at the level Cruz declared. We rate this claim Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECCACB80>],/factchecks/2017/aug/30/ted-cruz/ted-cruzs-mostly-false-claim-two-thirds-sandy-reli/

It's fake news that Floyd Mayweather Jr. donated $200 million to Houston for Hurricane Harvey relief
","Boxer Floyd Mayweather’s middle name might be money, but stories of him donating $200 million to the victims of Hurricane Harvey is definitely fake. An Aug. 29, 2017, post on HoustonChronicle-tv.com said, ""Floyd Mayweather Jr. donates a whopping sum of money to Houston after hurricane."" Facebook users reported the post as potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to fight fake news. The link at HoustonChronicle-tv.com redirects to a story on NewsPhd.com, which in turn credits the story to ""Houston Chronicles TV."" The Internet Archive showed that the story originally was posted at HoustonChronicle-tv.com but has apparently since been changed. The post said the champion boxer was giving $200 million to help victims of Hurricane Harvey, which displaced thousands with high winds and flooding. As of this writing, the death toll has reached 24, according to CNN. ""My thoughts and prayers are with our brothers and sisters in Houston,"" Mayweather is quoted. ""My initiative is donating $200m to the entire Houston community to assist and house victims of the devastating flood that has rendered people homeless. The fund is intended to provide shelter, food, clothing and medicines."" Facebook users also flagged the same assertion on a couple of other websites. There is no credible report that Mayweather, pictured below, has made a contribution that large. pic.twitter.com/Nq0qUlI0iu Mayweather’s name likely became a target for fake news writers after he won a guaranteed $100 million for his Aug. 26 boxing match against MMA fighter Conor McGregor (his share of money from the fight could climb as high as $300 million). HoustonChronicle-tv.com is not the website for a TV news station, or the Houston area’s real newspaper, the Houston Chronicle. It’s a fake news site that we’ve listed on our Fake News Almanac as mimicking a legitimate media outlet.   While Mayweather does have a foundation that aids and promotes community groups, there has been no news that the foundation or the boxer have given money out specifically for hurricane relief. Another sign the story is fake is that the same unsubstantiated details have been attributed to other boxers. This same story has already been reused, almost word-for-word, to say that boxer Manny Pacquiao gave $50 million to the city for hurricane relief. How or why this post has ended up on other sites is hard to say, but it doesn’t go the distance on our Truth-O-Meter.

"['Georgia', 'History', 'Brian Kemp']","
Kemp decries calls by 'radical left' to remove Washington, Jefferson statues. We looked for examples
","With the debate over Confederate statues roiling the country, Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp suggested a similar controversy is brewing over the founding fathers. ""You've seen it in the news — the radical left in our country, stinging from their 2016 election losses, has become increasingly desperate and unhinged,"" he wrote in an Aug. 23 fundraising email. ""They want nothing more than to push their snowflake agenda on the entire nation, and our conservative Georgia values are under attack like never before. Now they're even calling for the removal of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson statues in the name of political correctness! Friend, I know you agree we can't allow the radical left to win in Georgia and force their liberal agenda down our throats."" For us fact-checkers, the key question is whether there is a cry to get rid of statues of Washington and Jefferson. We found that a few people have said that, but whether there’s much of a drive is less certain. Between emailing the Kemp campaign and our own searches, we came up with some key instances. The clearest example came from Angela Rye, a CNN commentator and former Congressional Black Caucus director. ""George Washington was a slave owner,"" Rye said on CNN on Aug. 17. ""We need to call slave owners out for what they are. Whether we think they were protecting American freedom or not. He wasn’t protecting my freedom. I wasn’t someone — my ancestors weren’t deemed human beings to him. To me, I don’t care if it’s a George Washington statue or a Thomas Jefferson statue or a Robert E. Lee statue, they all need to come down."" An equally clear call for taking down a statue of Washington came from James Dukes, pastor of Liberation Christian Center in Chicago. After President Donald Trump asked rhetorically if statues of Washington and Jefferson were next on the list for removal after Confederate leaders, Dukes took up the idea. He asked Mayor Rahm Emanuel to take down an equestrian statue of George Washington in the city’s South Side and rename the park where it stands. ""It represents on one hand, a hero to some, a forefather, a revolutionary,"" Dukes said Aug. 16. ""But then for us of African-American descent, it represents a person who owned 317 slaves."" The prominent civil rights activist Al Sharpton also entered the fray, but the circumstances left it unclear whether this is something he might pursue further. Sharpton appeared on PBS’ Charlie Rose to talk about the violence in Charlottesville, Va. Rose asked Sharpton if the Jefferson Memorial should be taken down. ""My great-grandfather was a slave owned by the family that Strom Thurmond was one of them,"" Sharpton said Aug. 14. ""So this is personal. This is not some kind of removed discussion for us. Our families were victims of this. Certainly, it ought to be removed."" But Sharpton then continued, saying he didn’t want his tax dollars going to maintain a building that honors a man with ""that kind of background."" He said there are private museums for that. That left open the option to keep the memorial in place and fund it privately. As far as we can tell, Sharpton has not brought up the issue again. There are instances where people expressed dismay at the slave-owning pasts of Washington and Jefferson, but they didn’t call for removing statues. We mention them because some have put them in the same bucket as the previous examples. Wilbert Cooper, a senior editor at the news service Vice, wrote Aug. 17 that if there were ever a serious push to to blow up Mount Rushmore, ""I suspect I'd be onboard."" ""As long as we allow those men to be cults of personality who exist beyond reproach, we're never going to be able to see them for all of their good and all of their evil,"" Cooper wrote. A number of University of Virginia student organizations issued a list of demands to keep the history of slavery front and center on campus. The list included that ""the statue of Jefferson serves as an emblem of white supremacy and should be re-contextualized with a plaque to include that history."" At some point over the weekend of Aug. 19, the Jefferson statue on the University of Virginia campus was splashed with red paint. We have two clear cases of African-Americans saying statues of Washington should come down, and one case involving the Jefferson Memorial. For context, we compared this to the interest in removing Confederate statues. As an approximate measure, we turned to the Nexis database of articles in major newspapers. Between Aug. 11 and Aug. 22 (the day before Kemp’s email), there were 2,113 articles that mentioned removing Confederate statues, but made no mention of George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. In the same period, 183 articles mentioned removing Washington or Jefferson statues. This included Trump’s own reference to people seeking to take down those statues. Roughly speaking, the removal of Confederate statues is at least 11 times more commonly mentioned than taking down statues of Washington or Jefferson. Kemp said there are calls for the removal of statues of Washington and Jefferson. We found two instances where two people unambiguously called for those statues to come down, plus another instance where an interviewer’s question elicited a mixed reply that included the words ""certainly it ought to be removed."" Beyond those examples, there is scant evidence of a broader movement to take down statues of Washington and Jefferson, especially not along the lines of the push against Confederate monuments. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB79380>],/factchecks/2017/aug/30/brian-kemp/calls-take-down-washington-and-jefferson-statues/

Gaetz misleads in claim about immigrants, crime
","Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., told his constituents he supports a crackdown on sanctuary cities because immigrants in the country illegally threaten public safety. ""State and local governments that do not comply with our immigration laws are putting American citizens at risk. The facts are clear: the U.S. Sentencing Commission found that in 2014, 75 percent of all criminal defendants who were convicted and sentenced for federal drug offenses were illegal aliens,"" Gaetz said in an Aug. 18 email newsletter. ""As of 2014, illegal aliens made up roughly 3.5 percent of our population, and committed over 10 percent of all murders."" The topic of murders committed by immigrants living unlawfully in the country caught our attention. We found that there is no national dataset tracking this information. In 2014 immigrants unauthorized to live in the country did account for ""roughly 3.5 percent"" of the population. In recent years the number of immigrants living in the United States illegally has been estimated at around 11 million. The nation’s total population in 2014 was just under 320 million. Was that 3.5 percent responsible for more than 10 percent of murders in 2014, as Gaetz said? There is no conclusive data supporting this claim. Gaetz’s office pointed us to a September 2015 FoxNews.com report by Malia Zimmerman, headlined, ""Elusive crime wave data shows frightening toll of illegal immigrant criminals."" ""Statistics show the estimated 11.7 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. account for 13.6 percent of all offenders sentenced for crimes committed in the U.S. Twelve percent of murder sentences, 20 percent of kidnapping sentences and 16 percent of drug trafficking sentences are meted out to illegal immigrants,"" FoxNews.com reported, though it did not specify to which year those sentences correspond. FoxNews.com reported that there is no federal data presenting a comprehensive picture of crimes committed by immigrants in the country illegally, and that it reviewed ""a patchwork of local, state and federal statistics."" Some of the data examined came from the U.S. Sentencing Commission, said the FoxNews.com report. Largely due to a lack of available records, ""it is difficult to arrive at any ‘absolute’ or ‘concrete’ rate for crimes committed,"" Devin Murphy, a legislative correspondent for Gaetz’s office, said via email. He said ""more records would be useful in calculating specific crime rates."" Gaetz’s newsletter cites U.S. Sentencing Commission findings for 2014, so we took a look at the commission’s data report for fiscal year 2014, which details information on federal sentences including citizenship of offenders per primary offense category. The commission reported that in fiscal year 2014, 75 people were sentenced for murder: 64 of them were U.S. citizens and 11 noncitizen. (The noncitizen category includes ""resident alien,"" ""illegal alien,"" ""extradited alien,"" and ""non-U.S. citizen, alien status unknown."") Another, more detailed table provided to PolitiFact by the commission showed that of the 75 people sentenced, 9 of them, or 12 percent, were an ""illegal alien."" But it’s important to note that murder convictions and sentences are mostly handed at the local and state level, not federal. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program collects crime information voluntarily provided by local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. It reported an estimated 14,249 murders in 2014. Information is available regarding the age, sex, race and ethnicity of the offenders, but not on their immigration status. A July 2017 Cato Institute post by immigration policy analyst Alex Nowrasteh pointed out flaws in the FoxNews.com article used by Gaetz’s office to back his claim. ""Ms. Zimmerman’s claim that 12 percent of murder sentences were meted out to illegal immigrants in 2014 shows just how misleading it is to rely on partial federal data to make a point about nationwide crime,"" Nowrasteh wrote.  The commission’s report ""lists only 75 murderers sentenced to federal prison in 2014, a mere 0.5 percent of the 14,249 nationwide murders committed that year in the United States,"" he added. The commission’s data is ""a very small subset,"" and most of the serious, violent crime convictions happen at the state level, said Charis E. Kubrin, a professor of criminology, law and society at the University of California-Irvine, who recently examined 51 studies on the relationship between immigration and crime, mainly finding no correlation. ""It is misleading to make assumptions, to make inferences (based on the commission’s report) because it’s such unique data,"" Kubrin said. Gaetz said, ""As of 2014, illegal aliens made up roughly 3.5 percent of our population, and committed over 10 percent of all murders."" The unauthorized population in 2014 was roughly 3.5 percent of the U.S. population, as Gaetz said, but the rest of his claim is dubious. There is no national, comprehensive report or database tracking the share of murders committed by unauthorized immigrants. A U.S. Sentencing Commission report for fiscal year 2014 attributed more than 10 percent of murders to immigrants living in the country illegally, but that’s for a small subset: federal sentences for 75 people, 9 of whom were classified as an ""illegal alien."" Murder convictions and sentences are mostly handed at the local and state level, not federal.

"['Georgia', 'Taxes', 'Ending Spending Action Fund']","
Group attacks Michelle Nunn on tax position
","Michelle Nunn has been frequently described as the Georgia Democratic Party’s best chance in a decade to capture a U.S. Senate seat, but many voters don’t know much about her positions on a range of important issues. One group recently decided to educate Georgians about Nunn in a television ad, making a claim about her that PolitiFact Georgia thought should be measured on the Truth-O-Meter. ""Michelle Nunn wants to be your senator,"" a male voice in the ad says. ""She supports Obamacare and higher taxes."" The 30-second ad continues with the narrator saying that you may pay a penalty if the Internal Revenue Service does not like your health insurance plan. ""Michelle Nunn, the last thing Georgia taxpayers need,"" the narrator says at the end of the ad. Nunn’s campaign website, though, disputes the ad’s claim about her support of tax increases. ""(Tax) Reform shouldn’t raise taxes,"" it says. So, is the ad correct? The ad was paid for by a group called the Ending Spending Action Fund. Nunn has said she supports some components of the federal health care law, which many call Obamacare, and she wants changes made to other portions of the law. We hadn’t heard much from Nunn concerning her positions on taxes, so we decided to do some checking into the veracity of the organization’s claim. The Ending Spending Action Fund describes itself as ""an independent organization that proudly supports candidates regardless of party affiliation who favor enhancing free enterprise, reducing the size of government, and balancing our nation's budget."" Indeed, the fund seems to be a bipartisan critic. The group has also funded ads criticizing another U.S. Senate candidate from Georgia, Phil Gingrey, a Republican currently serving in the U.S. House of Representatives. It was founded in 2010 under another name by Joe Ricketts, a businessman who founded TD Ameritrade and whose family owns the Chicago Cubs baseball club, according to Open Secrets, a website that tracks money in politics. Ricketts has said he is a registered independent. The fund is based in Tampa, Fla. After several calls and email exchanges over the course of two weeks, the fund’s president and general counsel, Brian Baker, sent us a six-page report outlining its argument that the ad is correct that Nunn supports higher taxes. Its case on income taxes includes: Past interviews in which Nunn said ""we need to be willing to put both spending and revenues on the table"" to reduce the federal debt. It points to PolitiFact articles where our colleagues have written that raising revenue is a tax increase. Information from Nunn’s campaign website where she talked about closing tax loopholes on businesses. Nunn’s support for the federal health care law. We decided to break down the group’s argument by categories -- the tax code and the health care law. First, the tax code. Nunn campaign officials counter that she wants changes to the tax code that would be revenue-neutral, which they say meets the definition of prominent conservative tax groups such as Americans for Tax Reform of what is not a tax increase. In 2011, when the Georgia Legislature passed a tax package, Americans for Tax Reform supported the plan because it was revenue-neutral. Americans for Tax Reform asks candidates for federal office to sign a pledge that they will oppose any effort to increase the marginal tax rate on individuals and businesses as well as oppose any net deduction or elimination of deductions unless it is equally matched by a reduction in tax rates. Nunn’s campaign website lays out several initiatives that lower taxes for individuals and businesses. Her positions include: Lowering the federal corporate tax rate, although it does not specify what the rate should be. Simplifying the tax code to make it easier for taxpayers to claim tax credits. Increasing the startup deduction for businesses to $10,000. Extending tax credits for research and development. Now, on to the health care law. The health care law requires most uninsured Americans to buy health insurance. Individuals who don’t comply with the law face a tax penalty of at least $95 when they file their taxes next year. There are other taxes that raise revenue that are associated with the law. In its decision to uphold the individual mandate, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the penalty was basically a tax that Congress was imposing on people who failed to buy insurance. The contentious decision allowed President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement to survive a constitutional battle. There’s still plenty of debate on whether that penalty is a tax or just analogous to one. Nunn has said she supports the health care law but believes some elements of it need to be tweaked. Nunn campaign spokesman Nathan Click questioned the logic of using Nunn’s support of the health care law to conclude that she supports raising taxes since the health care law has already taken effect. To recap, the Ending Spending Action Fund put together an ad claiming Nunn supports raising taxes. It based that claim on prior interviews in which the candidate has said she would be willing to put revenue on the table to reduce the federal government’s debt and because of her general support of the federal health care law. Nunn’s positions on these issues, though, are more nuanced. Nunn has said several times she favors a revenue-neutral approach, which her campaign notes is a position some major conservative groups say is not a tax increase. Nunn wants to fix some elements of the health care law. Her campaign also says it’s odd to say Nunn supports raising taxes because Obamacare is already a policy that is the law, although the Republicans running for the Senate seat want to repeal the law. We believe the statement in the ad about Nunn oversimplifies her position and needs a lot of context. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB9CC140>],/factchecks/2014/apr/30/ending-spending-action-fund/group-attacks-michelle-nunn-tax-position/

""But now Scott Walker's DOA (Department of Administration) is outsourcing them -- I think to a company in Illinois, of all places -- and they're paying more money for them."" Really? A governor who is almost certain to break his promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs in his first term decides to have an out-of-state company make ""Welcome to Wisconsin"" signs -- at a higher price to the state? As we’ll see, Tate's statement from the beginning goes down the wrong road. Which signs? When we asked Democratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff for evidence to back Tate's claim, she said Tate ""may have erred"" on the type of highway sign he singled out. Indeed, Tate is simply wrong in referring to the ""Wisconsin Welcomes You"" signs -- those 23 signs are not being replaced. Rather, Baldauff provided a few news articles about the state Department of Transportation deciding to change vendors on a contract for maintenance of a different type of sign -- the ubiquitous and much smaller blue signs near highway and freeway exits throughout the state that alert motorists to gas stations, restaurants and other businesses. Those signs typically carry the businesses’ logos. According to the DOT, the Legislature created the so-called specific information signs program in 1990 to promote certain types of businesses within five miles of a highway. The program is designed to be self-funded -- in other words, the businesses, not taxpayers, pay the cost of building and maintaining the blue signs. That's an important point. Not only was Tate wrong in saying Walker was ""outsourcing"" the construction of the brown ""Wisconsin Welcomes You"" signs, he was wrong in suggesting that the outsourcing -- which actually refers to the maintenance of the blue roadway signs that  promote businesses -- is being done at a higher cost to taxpayers. Here’s what led up to Tate’s claim: The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in February 2014 that after 28 years of Milwaukee-based Derse-Wisconsin Highway Business Signs holding the blue signs contract, DOT had decided to give its next contract to Georgia-based Interstate Logos. DOT said Interstate Logos, which is subcontracting with a Portage, Wis., firm for part of the work, scored higher in the bid process that had been set up and would provide better signs and better service. As for the costs to businesses, Derse had proposed to charge $21 a month for signs along the interstate -- a reduction from the $30 it had charged for years -- and the same $10 a month it had been charging for signs along exit ramps. Meanwhile, Interstate Logos proposed charging $46 per month for signs on the interstate, but no additional charge for signs on ramps. After DOT decided to give the contract to Interstate Logos, however, the company agreed to use $30 and $10 fees that Derse had been using. A 10-year contract was put in place to start May 1, 2014. So, businesses aren’t facing a higher price under the new contract. And none of that is paid by taxpayers. Our rating Criticizing Walker’s record on job creation, Tate said Welcome to Wisconsin road signs have ""always been made in Wisconsin,"" but Walker ""is outsourcing them"" to an out-of-state company and ""paying more money for them."" No changes are being made to the large ""Wisconsin Welcomes You"" signs near the state’s borders. The state did give a sign maintenance contract to a Georgia firm, but businesses -- not state taxpayers -- pay for those small roadway signs and the prices in the contract are not increasing. We rate Tate’s statement False.  Comment on this item at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.   ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC729640>],/factchecks/2014/apr/30/mike-tate/scott-walker-outsourced-making-welcome-wisconsin-r/

Dawson Hodgson says R.I. Attorney General Peter Kilmartin never objected to the parole of murderer Alfred Brissette
","When the Rhode Island Parole Board granted parole to convicted murderer Alfred Brissette in November 2013, its decision was widely criticized. Among the critics was Attorney General Peter Kilmartin, whose office issued a statement at the time saying Brissette’s crime was ""so egregious that the Parole Board should have come to a different conclusion."" Now, state Sen. Dawson Hodgson, who is running against Kilmartin for attorney general, is criticizing the Democratic incumbent’s actions in the case. ""When the press went to the parole board and said ‘how can you let an animal like this loose,’ they responded by saying, well, we never received an objection from the attorney general or from the victim’s family,’"" Hodgson, a North Kingstown Republican, said in a March 27 interview on the public-access TV show ""State of the State."" ""Nobody was there to speak for somebody who couldn’t speak for herself,"" Hodgson said.  We wondered whether Hodgson had his facts straight. First, a little background. In June 1999, Brissette and Marc Girard, both 25, were arrested and charged with luring Jeannette Descoteaux from her hometown of Woonsocket to the woods of Burrillville where they beat her to death. Brissette hit her multiple times in the head with a lug wrench. Girard went to trial, was found guilty by a jury in 2001 and sentenced to life. Brissette pleaded no contest to second-degree murder in 2004 and was sentenced to serve 35 years in prison. (The sentence included the time he spent since being imprisoned at the Adult Correctional Institutions since 1999.) The judge in the case, Judith Savage,  excoriated Brissette, describing him as a thrill killer who simply wanted to see someone die. Brissette was initially granted parole in June 2012, with a projected release in December, but concerns about whether he could meet the conditions of the release prompted the board to delay his release until November 2013, about 14 years after he was first jailed. The board cited Brissette’s clean prison disciplinary record, and his participation in ACI rehabilitation programs and the programs set up to monitor and support him after release. Was Hodgson right that Kilmartin hadn’t objected to Brissette’s parole? ""That is correct,"" Kilmartin spokeswoman Amy Kempe said. The Brissette parole exposed a flaw in the parole process that has since been corrected, Kempe said. At the time, she said, the attorney general’s office would get a list of inmates up for consideration, sometimes as few as 10 days or so before the board met. The prosecutors in the office would review the list to determine whether they should raise any objections.   If that list had two dozen or more names, the review could take time, she said. Brissette’s case was 14 years old, and none of the prosecutors who worked on it were still employed by the department, so no one raised an objection, Kempe said. Since the Brissette case, Kempe said the attorney general’s office now gets the parole lists a month or even two months ahead of time, which gives the office enough time to investigate each request. It also gives the office staff time to prepare an argument for its position, Kempe said. That was important, she said, because if the attorney general’s office simply opposed every parole request automatically, the office’s objections would become commonplace and lose their credibility. Parole Board Chairman Kenneth Walker declined to explain why the board approved Brissette’s release other than to say the board has confidence in the program devised for him. He said the lack of a recommendation from the attorney general had no effect on the board’s decision. Our ruling Dawson T. Hodgson said Attorney General Peter Kilmartin’s office didn’t oppose the parole request of convicted murderer Alfred Brissette. Kilmartin’s spokeswoman and the chairman of the parole board confirmed that was correct. We rule Hodgson’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC729440>],/factchecks/2014/apr/30/dawson-hodgson/dawson-hodgson-says-ri-attorney-general-peter-kilm/

Barack Obama says 'the average minimum wage worker is 35 years old'
","It’s become clear that raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 is one of President Barack Obama’s highest-priority proposals at the moment. The rhetoric coming out of his White House certainly supports that notion. On April 26, Obama included this passage in his weekly address: ""Right now, there’s a bill that would boost America’s minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. That would lift wages for nearly 28 million Americans across the country. 28 million. And we’re not just talking about young people on their first job. The average minimum wage worker is 35 years old. They work hard, often in physically demanding jobs."" It’s pretty transparent that Obama is seeking to counter the notion that a wage hike would simply help teenagers taking a summer job or college students making some extra money slinging hash at the local diner. But is Obama's specific claim that, ""The average minimum wage worker is 35 years old"" accurate? The White House told us it used a study by the Economic Policy Institute. This is a liberal group that’s in tune with many of Obama’s policies, but for the moment, let’s put that aside. The study looked at anyone earning less than $10.10 an hour, under the logic that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 wouldn’t just raise wages for those earning $7.25 an hour, but rather for everybody earning less than $10.10. In addition, David Cooper, the author of the report, told PolitiFact that his calculations actually included everyone currently earning up to $11.10 -- a dollar more than Obama’s proposed minimum wage level. This decision was made on the assumption that anyone earning slightly above $10.10 at the time of the minimum-wage hike would also get a small boost, in order to keep them nestled correctly in a company’s wage hierarchy. EPI found that the average age of workers earning under $11.10 is 35 years old. If you don’t read Obama’s sentence closely, it would seem that he’s right. But actually, he muffed the talking point. Whereas EPI’s study looked at workers who earned as much as four dollars an hour more than the federal minimum wage, Obama’s words referred to people who are actually being paid the minimum wage today. We ran this by Cooper, the report’s author. He told PolitiFact that if you look at workers ""at or near their effective state minimum wage,"" which he defined as within 3 percent of the minimum-wage level, the average age is 31. That's in the ballpark but lower than the 35-year-old figure Obama cited. In reality, the statistics on this specific point are murky. A different study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that 71 percent of minimum-wage workers are younger than 30 -- a starkly different picture of low-wage workers. But the BLS study has an important limitation -- it looked only at workers making exactly the federal minimum wage of $7.25 and below, so it doesn’t include workers from any of the 21 states and the District of Columbia that have enacted higher state minimum wages. A few weeks earlier, the White House used the same EPI statistic correctly. In a tweet, White House spokesman Jay Carney touted an infographic that asked, among other things, ""Who will raising the minimum wage actually help? … More than half work full-time. The average worker is 35 years old."" Carney’s claim focused on workers who will benefit from a wage hike, which is in line with what the study looked at. We rated that statement Half True, in part because the infographic ignored the different conclusion of the BLS study and relied only on one report from a friendly group. This time, by contrast, Obama didn’t cite the correct number. Our ruling The White House had a point earlier this month when it tweeted that those who would benefit from a $10.10 wage hike average 35 years of age. But Obama’s subsequent comment was less accurate. In his weekly address, the actual statistic using the data from the same report is 31, and partial data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests that the average age could be even lower than that. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB58400>],/factchecks/2014/apr/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-average-minimum-wage-worker-35-y/

Limbaugh: 'Some of the wealthiest Americans are African-American now'
","There’s the truth, there’s distortions and then there’s Rush Limbaugh’s April 28, 2014, radio show. In it, the conservative American radio talk show host decided to discuss the racist comments allegedly made by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling. At one point, Limbaugh described Sterling as ""a typical Hollywood Democrat."" That’s incorrect (Sterling is a registered Republican -- to the extent it matters). ""The only reason (Sterling’s) in trouble right now is he did not give enough money to Obama,"" Limbaugh proclaimed. That’s highly speculative, so we can’t fact-check Limbaugh on this point. At another point in his Sterling talk, Limbaugh discussed how things generally are going for African-Americans in the United States. Limbaugh’s diagnosis: pretty darn good. ""You've got a black president. You've got a black attorney general. You've got the wealthiest TV performer in American history is a African-American woman. That would be The Oprah,"" Limbaugh said. ""Some of the wealthiest Americans are African-American now."" That last line is quite incorrect. The go-to source to learn about the wealthiest Americans is Forbes, which tracks the fortunes of the world’s elite. It publishes an annual list of the 400 wealthiest Americans and a list of the world’s billionaires. The most recent Forbes list was released in March 2014. (Bloomberg also publishes a less expansive list of the world’s billionaires.) For some perspective, the folks at the bottom of Forbes’ wealthiest Americans list are worth an estimated $1.3 billion. At the top is Bill Gates, who is worth an estimated $72 billion. How many African-Americans make up the American Top 400? One, according to Forbes. Oprah Winfrey is worth an estimated $2.9 billion -- ranking her 184th on the list. For the record, it isn’t only rare for African-Americans to be billionaires in the United States. According to Forbes, there are only nine black billionaires in the world. So who are the wealthiest African-Americans besides Winfrey? We found two other lists using Forbes data that are a few years old. Here’s a list, with the date of the last update: Entertainer Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, $550 million (April 2012) BET founder Robert Johnson, $550 million (May 2009) Golfer Tiger Woods, $500 million (September 2010) Former basketball player Michael Jordan, $500 million (September 2010) Former basketball player Magic Johnson, $500 million (May 2009) That means no African-American other than Oprah Winfrey is even close to cracking the Top 400 list. Our ruling Limbaugh said, ""Some of the wealthiest Americans are African-American now."" We reached out to Limbaugh with our finding but have not heard back. Of the top 400 wealthiest Americans, exactly one is African-American -- that’s .25 percent. Also, no other African-American is really all that close to breaking into the Top 400.

Marco Rubio says Second Amendment is unique in speech to NRA
","Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., went all in for gun owners in a speech to the NRA as the potential presidential candidate sought to squelch any doubts about his commitment to gun rights. Rubio was one of a few 2016 Republican presidential hopefuls who spoke at the NRA’s annual convention in Indianapolis on April 25. He described the right to own a gun as part of the American Dream, highlighted the ""futility"" of existing gun laws and chastised the media for stigmatizing gun owners. At one point, Rubio described the Constitution of the United States as unique. ""I'm always amused that those who come up to me and say no other country has a constitutional right like this,"" he said. ""As if to imply that there is something wrong with us. But we say no other country has a constitutional right like this not with scorn, but with pride."" Wayne LaPierre, the NRA’s executive vice president and CEO, made a similar statement during his own speech to the annual meeting, saying, ""Our Second Amendment freedom separates us from every other country on earth."" Is it correct that the United States is the only country that gives residents a constitutional right to bear arms? The Second Amendment The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states: ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" We asked several legal experts if the United States is the only such country that has a constitutional right to bear arms. Tom Ginsburg, University of Chicago international law professor and co-director of the Comparative Constitutions Project, has studied gun rights in national constitutions dating back to 1789. Only a minority of constitutions have ever included gun rights, and the number has dwindled, Ginsburg concluded in a 2013 article he wrote with Zachary Elkins, a University of Texas government professor. But Ginsburg added in an interview with PolitiFact that ""the precise language in each constitution is different, and no other country has the ‘well-regulated militia’ language."" Of the constitutions that do have an explicit right to bear arms ""ours is the only one that does not explicitly include a restrictive condition,"" wrote Elkins in a New York Times op-ed. The Constitutions Project zeroed in on two countries: ""We code only Mexico, Guatemala and the U.S. as having a right to bear arms,"" Ginsburg told PolitiFact. While the constitutions of Haiti and Iran do mention guns, ""the provision was too ambiguous for us to consider it a true right to bear arms."" Here is how the Comparative Constitutions Project translates the right to own arms in Guatemala and Mexico: • Guatemala Article 38: ""The right to own (‘tenencia’) weapons for personal use, not prohibited by the law, in the place of inhabitation, is recognized. There will not be an obligation to hand them over, except in cases ordered by a competent judge."" • Mexico Article 10: ""The inhabitants of the United Mexican States have the right to possess arms in their residences for their protection and legitimate defense, except such as are expressly forbidden by law or which have been reserved for the exclusive use of the Army, Navy, Air Force and National Guard. Federal law will determine the circumstances, conditions, requirements, and places in which the bearing of arms by inhabitants will be authorized."" The authors of the article concluded that ""the U.S. Constitution is alone in omitting any written conditions under which the government can regulate arms and munitions. In other countries, the right is typically limited to self-defense, either of the home or the state itself."" Guatemala, they note, ""gives its citizens the right to own weapons for personal use in the home and states that citizens can only be forced to relinquish guns by judicial order. Haiti gives citizens the right to use guns to defend the home but explicitly denies a general right to bear arms."" They added that in the United States, the judicial branch has ruled that some restrictions on gun ownership are permissible -- they just aren’t outlined in the Constitution itself. ""U.S. courts have allowed some exceptions to unconditional gun ownership in the form of local, state and federal statutes restricting ownership or possession of firearms,"" the authors wrote. ""In this way, the courts have served to render constitutional law somewhat less exceptional than the text itself would suggest."" Other legal experts we consulted agreed that Mexican and Guatemalan constitutions come closest to the United States’, at least up to a point. ""If the question is an express right to arms in the nation’s Constitution, there's also Mexico, Haiti, and Guatemala,"" said David Kopel, research director at the Independence Institute and adjunct professor of Advanced Constitutional Law at Denver University. ""The Mexican and Haitian governments essentially ignore the right, and get away with doing so. For example, there is only one gun store allowed in the entire nation of Mexico."" (There is a long list of criteria to buy a gun at this sole legal outlet, according to the Washington Post.) The NRA didn’t respond directly to our fact-check, but Kopel told PolitiFact that he frequently writes for the NRA’s magazine. One law professor also suggested we look at Switzerland. PolitiFact explained in a fact-check in 2013 that the Swiss government requires nearly every able-bodied young male adult to serve in the citizen militia, where they are issued a military rifle. The guns are supposed to be for military use only, not for personal defense. Anyone who wants to keep the weapon after their years of service can do so if they can provide an acceptable reason; the gun is then refitted to limit its firepower. Switzerland does not have a constitutional right to keep and bear arms, Kopel said. Rubio’s response We sent Rubio’s spokesman a 2010 article in Slate that stated Mexico, Haiti and Guatemala have the right to bear arms in their Constitutions though it stated that Guatemala was the only one as broad as our Second Amendment. Spokesman Alex Conant said the language in the Guatemalan Constitution isn’t as strong as the language in the U.S. Second Amendment, which includes ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."" Conant also suggested we take a look at the characterization of Guatemala’s gun laws on www.gunpolicy.org, a website hosted by the Sydney School of Public Health that supports global efforts to prevent gun injury. The website calls Guatemala’s gun laws ""restrictive"" while it labeled our gun laws ""permissive."" ""All you seem to have established is that one country has some language similar to ours, but in practice does not treat the right in the same way,"" Conant said. Our ruling Rubio said during a speech to the NRA that ""no other country has a constitutional right"" like the Second Amendment. Mexico and Guatemala have the right to bear arms in their constitutions. However, the Second Amendment is unique because it is the only one that doesn’t include restrictive conditions within the constitutional language.

"['Georgia', 'Education', 'The David Perdue Files']","
Common Core claim doesn't make the grade
","Republican U.S. Senate candidate David Perdue is now on a list that shows he’s truly arrived in politics -- he’s the subject of a website attack. It’s called ""The David Perdue Files,"" and it accuses the political newcomer of being a RINO -- Republican in Name Only -- with ""liberal positions and establishment ties."" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider column brought the website to our attention with a post about it. The website included several ""facts"" about Perdue. One caught our attention, since it’s an issue that many conservatives have been as strident in their opposition to as the federal health care law, aka Obamacare. ""David Perdue supports Common Core,"" it says. True? The website cites a Marietta Daily Journal interview with Perdue done in February. The article, though, offers some context that’s not offered on the web post about the candidate. The people who put the website together haven’t identified themselves (the website’s author is Truth Be Told), so we couldn’t talk to them about it. Perdue is part of a crowded field of Republicans running this year for an open seat in the U.S. Senate. The current senator, Saxby Chambliss, a Republican, is retiring. Perdue, a former CEO of several larger companies and a cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue, has risen to the top of some polls and, thus, become a target of his opponents and others leery of some of his positions. The Republican Party primary is set for May 20. The campaign for the GOP nomination has largely been a contest among the candidates to prove who is the most conservative. On one issue, Common Core, the candidates have largely spoken against it. The anti-Perdue website, though, says he supports it. If true, it could mean trouble for Perdue. Common Core is a set of educational guidelines aimed at creating uniformed standards for student proficiency in several subjects. They were created by governors and education officials and adopted in nearly every state. Sonny Perdue helped spearhead the effort and has said it was a way to prevent the federal government from interfering in state education policies. The Common Core standards were released in June 2010 with the support of the National Governors Association and other groups. ""We felt like we needed to take steps as governors to actually prevent a federal mandate that came in this area. We saw No Child Left Behind as somewhat of an intrusion in state business,"" the former governor said in a 2013 Washington Post interview. ""We didn’t want another federal mandate that came in and said: ‘Here’s what your state looks like compared to Switzerland’ or wherever."" The Common Core plan was adopted by Georgia GOP leaders in 2010. This past June, however, the state Republican Party voted unanimously to urge state leaders to withdraw from the program because it ""obliterates Georgia's constitutional autonomy."" Tea party leaders and others say Common Core was adopted with little debate, and they worried it would be a federal takeover of education. The Obama administration has awarded extra points in its Race to the Top funding program for states that have worked to create common college- and career-ready standards. The Republican-led state House of Representatives passed legislation this year to create a study committee on Common Core and the federal government’s ""increasingly greater role in public education."" David Perdue, whose wife and parents were teachers, said he has talked to his cousin about the issue. ""The original intent, I agree with that. It’s where it gets into the details, into the weeds of how it’s going to be administered, that’s where I have a problem with that,"" Perdue said in the Marietta Daily Journal. The candidate said Georgia should determine how it sets its standards, and the newspaper reported that Perdue said he agrees with Gov. Nathan Deal’s position opposing the testing component of Common Core. Perdue made similar comments in an interview posted on YouTube. The candidate said he didn’t have a problem with Common Core’s original intent. ""When they start trying to legislate and dictate curriculum and that sort of thing, and that includes how you measure up in the test, I have a major problem with that,"" he said. ""I’d really like to get the Department of Education out of this and get that money back to the states and put the power back into teachers and parents, which is where it belongs."" Some conservatives question Perdue’s explanation. Erick Erickson, a prominent conservative commentator and radio show host who has endorsed former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel in the Senate race, asked Perdue about his comments in the Marietta Daily Journal. Perdue said Common Core had gotten ""convoluted"" when the federal government got involved. His campaign said Perdue supports what was put together by the National Governors Association. ""I want to clear the air. I think Common Core is overreaching right now and should be abandoned in its current form,"" Perdue said in a radio interview with Erickson on News 95.5 and AM 750 WSB. News 95.5 and AM 750 WSB is owned by Cox Enterprises, which also owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Perdue spokesman Derrick Dickey told PolitiFact Georgia that the candidate believes ""Common Core has become overreaching and should be abandoned."" Dickey called The David Perdue Files ""a crass, politically motivated effort to misrepresent many of David’s positions."" Judging from The David Perdue Files website, Perdue has not convinced some conservatives about his position on Common Core. To sum up, a website claimed Perdue ""supports Common Core."" Perdue has said in several interviews that he believes in the initial intent of Common Core as a means of states setting their own educational goals by what was proposed by the National Governors Association. Perdue, though, has said he is concerned about federal involvement in the effort. The website is correct on some level. Perdue did initially support the concept of Common Core, like many other Republicans. But he has made it very clear he has soured on the details and now opposes it. There is a kernel of truth here, but just a kernel. We rate the website attack on Perdue as Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAAB5080>],/factchecks/2014/apr/29/david-perdue-files/common-core-claim-doesnt-make-grade/

A big reason illegal immigrants become illegal is they change jobs, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul says
","Freshman U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is rated a first-tier Republican presidential contender for 2016, made a trip to heavily Democratic Chicago and Milwaukee to advocate for private school vouchers and to reach out to low-income and Latino residents. Along the way, he made an interesting claim about how many illegal immigrants actually entered the United States legally. On April 23, 2014, Paul visited St. Anthony School, a voucher school touted as the largest K3-12 Catholic school in the country and the largest Latino education institution in Milwaukee.   During an exchange with reporters, the co-founder of the Senate tea party caucus was asked whether his 2013 vote against immigration reform sent a ""conflicting message to you being pro-Latino."" The bill had passed the Senate, winning votes from all 52 Democrats plus 14 Republicans and two independents, but was never taken up by the GOP-controlled House. It would have allowed the some 11 million immigrants without documents to get permission to live and work in the country legally, while also providing a pathway to citizenship and taking steps to improve border security. Paul told the reporter he supports immigration reform, but that one reason he voted against the bill is it would have too strictly limited the number of people who could enter the United States with work visas. He continued by saying: ""One of the fundamental problems in our immigration system currently -- of the 11 million who are here, 40 percent had a visa and then became illegal. The primary reason they become illegal is that they were picking crops for $9 an hour and they saw a sign for $14 an hour doing construction work. They changed jobs."" Is Paul right? Understanding immigration A foreign citizen seeking to immigrate generally must be sponsored by a U.S. citizen or prospective employer, and have an approved petition before applying for an immigrant visa. Some people, of course, cross the border into the United States illegally. And others -- tourists, students or temporary workers, for example -- enter legally on non-immigrant temporary visas, but then never leave. A word here on terminology. According to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center Hispanic Trends Project, a leading authority on immigration, ""unauthorized immigrants"" are all foreign-born non-citizens residing in the country who are not ""legal immigrants."" These definitions reflect standard usage by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and academic researchers. The vast majority of unauthorized immigrants entered the country without valid documents or arrived with valid visas but stayed past their visa expiration date or otherwise violated the terms of their admission. The latest estimates by Pew and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security put the number of unauthorized immigrants at at least 11.5 million. That's more than triple the 3.5 million in 1990, but down from the peak of 12.2 million in 2007, according to Pew.  The number remains relatively high even though there were 1.58 million deportations under President Barack Obama from 2009 through 2012, a faster pace than the 2.01 million deportations done during President George W. Bush’s two terms (2001-2008). Now let’s get back to Paul’s claim on how many unauthorized immigrants entered the country legally but became illegal because they changed jobs. Paul's evidence Asked for evidence to back Paul's claim, a spokesman cited an April 2013 Wall Street Journal news article. It said 40 percent of the 11 million undocumented workers in the United States were foreigners who arrived legally, but overstayed their visas. So, that gives some support to the 40 percent part of Paul’s claim, but the article did not address how many of those immigrants became illegal because they changed jobs. Other evidence PolitiFact Texas in 2013 and PolitiFact National in 2010 rated statements by two congressmen that about 40 percent of illegal immigrants became illegal because they overstayed their visas. Our colleagues reported on a 2006 study by Pew, which they cited as the latest available. It estimated that out of 11.5 million to 12 million illegal immigrants in 2006, between 33 percent and 50 percent were ""visa overstayers."" The report split the difference by proposing a figure of 45 percent. Our colleagues rated both 40 percent statements Mostly True, but pointed out that not only were the figures estimates, they were several years old, even though they were the latest available. However, we could find no evidence -- and Paul didn’t provide any -- to show that the main reason the 40 percent of unauthorized immigrants became illegal was that they changed jobs. The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that studies worldwide immigration, is not aware of any estimates on how many undocumented U.S. immigrants became illegal because of a job change, a spokeswoman told us. Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors stricter immigration laws, said job change ""is certainly not the primary reason"" for so-called visa overstays. Vaughan said the vast majority of visa overstays are people who enter the United States with a tourist visa and then stay. She noted that millions of people each year get tourist visas while only tens of thousands are permitted temporary work visas. As a footnote, regarding the scenario Paul described: Vaughan said it would be illegal for a person admitted to the United States on a temporary visa for agricultural work to then take a job in a different industry and remain in the country without making the proper immigrant application and getting it approved. The government allots temporary work visas in areas such as agriculture where laborers are needed, but not with the idea that that person can then take any job and remain in the country, she said.   Our rating Paul said 40 percent of illegal immigrants ""had a visa and then became illegal,"" mostly because ""they changed jobs."" The best estimates are that roughly 40 percent of illegal immigrants had entered the country legally but became illegal when they overstayed their temporary visa. There is not evidence, however, to indicate that most of those people became illegal simply because they changed jobs. We rate Paul's statement Half True.

Drudge says Clippers owner is a Democrat
","When Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling was outed for allegedly making racist comments, conservatives leapt to dig deeper and came up with a surprising find. Sterling is a Democrat. Or so they claimed. Matt Drudge tweeted to more than 264,000 followers: ""NYT informed the unwashed how Bundy is a Republican. Leaves out NBA Sterling is a Democrat."" A recording of Sterling telling his girlfriend not to bring African-American friends to basketball games came on the heels of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy suggesting blacks would do better as slaves. Hence, Drudge’s tweet comparing the two men. PunditFact adds its research to the work of several other news organizations to correct the record on Sterling. (Hat tips below.) He is a registered Republican, according to the Los Angeles County voter registry. As far as we can tell, the conservative website Daily Caller was the first to tie Sterling to the Democratic Party. It had an click-baiting item on Saturday that declared, ""Race hate spewing Clippers owner is Democratic donor."" That article listed Sterling’s campaign contributions from more than 20 years ago. He spread a total of $4,000 among three Democrats, including former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, and California Gov. Gray Davis. According to public records, he has given no money to any candidate since. Shortly after midnight, the National Review Online posted that Sterling was a Democrat and then sometime later corrected itself. ""An earlier version of this post identified Sterling as a Democrat,"" the editor wrote. ""Although his political donations appear to have been exclusively to Democrats, his official party affiliation is not known."" At about noon on Sunday, Drudge made his claim. In the wee hours, as Sunday became Monday, Los Angeles Times columnist Michael Hiltzik rebutted those statements. Hiltzik tweeted, ""What makes anyone think Donald Sterling is a Democrat? LA County records show him registered Republican since 1998."" Mother Jones, Talking Points Memo and the Washington Post quickly made the same point during the day on Monday. Our ruling Drudge said Sterling is a Democrat. County records show that he is a registered Republican and has been for many years. His donations to Democrats took place two decades ago and were modest even by the standards of that time. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

"['Bankruptcy', 'Candidate Biography', 'Taxes', 'Texas', 'David Dewhurst']","
Dewhurst correct government acted on Patrick not paying taxes, but records inconclusive on his 'pocketing' employees' payroll taxes
","David Dewhurst says the Republican who led him in the March 2014 primary for the party’s lieutenant governor nomination has a financially shaky background. Dewhurst, lieutenant governor since 2003, faces challenger Dan Patrick, a Houston state senator, in a May 27, 2014, primary runoff. In Dewhurst's video ad that came public April 16, 2014, the narrator said Patrick ""got caught not paying his taxes"" and ""pocketed his employees’ payroll taxes."" In the ad, those claims are prefaced by an excerpt from a lieutenant governor debate in which a reporter said Patrick had walked away from more than $800,000 in debts when he declared personal bankruptcy. Patrick’s bankruptcy filing has been covered before. But did he get caught not paying taxes and also pocket employee payroll taxes? Backup from news story, tax liens Via the Quorum Report, a Capitol newsletter, we came to a Dewhurst web page on his ad attributing most of what he said to a Sept. 19, 2013, Dallas Morning News story on Patrick’s financial troubles. According to the News' story, Patrick filed for bankruptcy in October 1986 under his birth name, Dannie Scott Goeb, and ""walked away from about $800,000 in debts."" The story said that years later, he legally changed his name to Dan Patrick. The bankruptcy was connected to a failed business venture. According to a January 2007 Texas Monthly story, Patrick and others in the 1980s had ""opened Dan and Nick’s Sportsmarket, one of the first sports bars in the U.S. Located in tony Rice Village, the combination bar and restaurant was all polished brass and fine woods, full of local jocks and celebrities, TVs tuned constantly to sporting events. (Too constantly: The NFL would sue Patrick and five other bar owners in 1987 for showing blacked-out games.) For a while the business thrived, largely on the strength of Patrick’s personality,"" the story said, ""but he soon fell prey to the same financial lunacy that infected so many Houstonians in the early eighties. He bought another bar and restaurant, and then another, expanding, finally, to five. Then the oil bust hit, and in short order the man who had made $100,000 as a sportscaster closed four of his businesses, declared bankruptcy, and watched his annual income plummet to $10,000."" Payroll taxes unpaid When Patrick filed for bankruptcy, the News’ story said, he listed more than $816,000 in debts and just over $104,000 in assets. ""Among his debtors,"" the story said, ""was the Internal Revenue Service, which Patrick owed $13,186 in federal income taxes withheld from his restaurant employees’ paychecks."" By email, Dewhurst campaign spokeswoman Eliza Vielma sent us information indicating that from April 1986 into November 1988, Patrick’s companies were hit with five federal tax liens totaling $18,272.26--with unpaid employee payroll taxes comprising the bulk of that total. Vielma pointed out too that Patrick’s online response to the Dewhurst claim concedes he filed for personal bankruptcy and once owed payroll taxes. Patrick’s ad response states his bankruptcy filing doesn’t prove he collected and pocketed the taxes, adding: ""This is not a defense; however, it is a technical distinction. According to Patrick, these taxes were ultimately paid and the debt to the federal government was settled."" Generally, employers collect half of each employee’s payroll taxes and pony up the other half, with the resulting money going to the federal government for Medicare and Social Security. The essence of Dewhurst’s charge appears to be that Patrick pocketed payroll taxes paid by workers in failing to forward it to the IRS. The News’ story said Patrick ""also owed smaller amounts in property taxes to two Houston-area school districts, who later sued his companies for nonpayment. And his businesses were slapped with more than two dozen tax liens by federal, state and local governments. ""Patrick said he worked extra jobs and eventually paid off the IRS,"" the newspaper said, also quoting Patrick as saying he couldn’t recall details of his bankruptcy case’s closing in 1992. ""More than a decade later, as he got ready for his first bid for the Senate,"" the story said, Patrick ""cleared up all the tax liens through the secretary of state’s office."" Patrick: Taxes paid up We asked Patrick’s campaign for relevant documentation. Logan Spence, his campaign manager, emailed us state and federal documents showing that in April 1986, an IRS administrator signed off on a lien against Patrick’s company of $15,356.68 for unpaid employee payroll taxes. Another document showed an IRS official approving a lien of $4,297.22 for unpaid federal income taxes. At our inquiry, the Morning News emailed us excerpts from Patrick’s bankruptcy case file. The provided 10 pages show Patrick’s bankruptcy filing was initiated Oct. 27, 1986 and was closed Oct. 22, 1992. Also, a document indicates, Patrick (whose legal name was then Goeb) was ""released from all dischargeable debts"" on May 4, 1987. But 941 taxes incurred by Watchbear, Inc., in 1985 and 1986 were still owed to the federal government, another document indicates, totaling $13,186.29--a figure that matches what the News story described as taxes withheld from restaurant employees’ pay checks. By phone, Spence noted the $13,186 figure on the bankruptcy filing was accompanied by the words ""less recent payment,"" which Spence described as referring to Patrick already paying some unpaid taxes. Saying all of Patrick’s debts associated with the bankruptcy of his restaurants ""have been settled,"" Spence also emailed a photo of a Nov. 5, 1990, letter from an IRS official to Patrick, whose legal last name remained Goeb, stating that $13,186.29 had been paid in full on Nov. 6, 1989. Spence also emailed documents indicating that in January and February 2006, then-State Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn cleared Patrick of liens for sales taxes previously unpaid to the City of Houston and Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County totaling $11,717.73. At the time, Patrick was making his first run for the Senate. Experts say records inconclusive about 'pocketing' By email and telephone, a couple tax and accounting experts who looked over the News-provided documents at our request said they indicate Patrick’s company failed to submit payroll taxes to the government, though both said the documents did not demonstrate Patrick pocketed the employee shares of payroll taxes--or otherwise. Arthur Agulnek, who teaches accounting at the University of Texas at Dallas, said the 941 liens show Patrick failed to pay the payroll taxes to the IRS; ""he didn’t pay it where it was supposed to go."" Michael Harris, a professor of accounting at St. Edward’s University, speculated: ""The money was very likely spent on other bills."" Our ruling Dewhurst said Patrick got caught not paying taxes and pocketed employees’ payroll taxes. The first part of this claim is backed up by records showing the IRS filed liens because Patrick’s company didn’t submit payroll taxes in parts of 1985 and 1986. Patrick also had liens filed against him for unpaid state and local sales taxes. Documents indicate Patrick caught up on his federal tax tab in 1989 and met his sales tax obligations in 2006, the year he ran for the Senate. We see no confirmation, though, that Patrick ""pocketed"" employees’ payroll taxes, though such taxes did go unpaid to the government at times. On balance, we rate Dewhurst’s statement as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Julián Castro']","
Visa overstayers comprise 38 percent to 50 percent of unauthorized U.S. residents, per 2006 calculations
","Julián Castro slammed Republican state Sen. Dan Patrick for not sharing his perspective on immigration issues, asking Patrick at one point if he’d even read federal immigration legislation stalled in Congress. And another thing, the Democratic mayor of San Antonio said during the April 15, 2014, Univision program: ""Do you know that up to 45 percent of the people who are here undocumented or illegal, whatever word you want to use, are not people that physically crossed the southern border or northern border? They are visa overstayers; they are people that came to this country and then just overstayed their visa."" Castro’s declaration rang a bell. In September 2013, we found Mostly True a claim by U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, that about 40 percent of U.S. illegal immigrants ""came in on an airplane, with a legal visa, and just overstayed their visa and have never gone home."" That percentage aligned with an oft-repeated estimate, supported by a 2006 report by the Pew Hispanic Center, of the share of unauthorized residents who had overstayed visas, though we came up with no research into how many overstayers came by airplane. By email, Castro spokesman Jaime Castillo said the mayor’s statement drew on a 2013 web post on overstayers by the Federation for Immigration Reform, whose mission statement is to educate Americans about the costs of immigration, particularly illegal immigration. The group’s post said that up to 45 percent of unauthorized immigrants are overstayers. Group cites 2006 Pew document But it wasn't citing fresh research. Instead, the figure was attributed to the June 2006 Pew Hispanic Center fact sheet earlier bandied by Carter. Pew wrote then: ""Nearly half of all the unauthorized migrants now living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport or a border crossing point where they were subject to inspection by immigration officials."" ""As much as 45% of the total unauthorized migrant population entered the country with visas that allowed them to visit or reside in the U.S. for a limited amount of time,"" Pew said. ""Known as ‘overstayers,’ these migrants became part of the unauthorized population when they remained in the country after their visas had expired,"" it said. Pew continued: ""Another smaller share of the unauthorized migrant population entered the country legally from Mexico using a Border Crossing Card, a document that allows short visits limited to the border region, and then violated the terms of admission. The rest of the unauthorized migrant population, somewhat more than half, entered the country illegally."" A wrinkle: The center’s estimate of overstayers initially ranged from 38 percent to 50 percent of unauthorized residents. The center split the difference by proposing its figure of up to 45 percent. How the estimate was reached Specifically, the center estimated, some 4.5 million to 6 million of the 11.5 million to 12 million unauthorized residents as of 2006 entered legally through ports of entry. The bulk of these entrants came in as tourists or as business visitors, the center said. According to the government, the center said, there were 179 million nonimmigrant admissions in 2004, meaning individual entries by foreigners authorized for temporary stays. The center said its estimate came from modifying a methodology devised by a government demographer who analyzed internal files in the 1990s to estimate the size and key characteristics of individuals who overstayed their visas. In 1997, the demographer, Robert Warren, concluded that the unauthorized migrant population totaled 5 million and that 2.1 million, or 41 percent, consisted of visa overstayers, according to the center, while Homeland Security later estimated that about one third of unauthorized residents in 2000 were visa overstayers and the Government Accountability Office, drawing on alternate data sources, put the percentage of such overstayers at 27 percent, 31 percent and 57 percent. Of course, the data in the Pew report, in addition to being estimates, are several years old, causing us to wonder what has changed. In 2013, Jeffrey Passel, the center’s senior demographer, told us by email the information had not been updated, though he’d seen ""no evidence of a significant change in the makeup of the resident unauthorized population in terms of method of arrival."" We were unable to reach him for this follow-up fact check. Our ruling Castro said up to 45 percent of illegal immigrants ""are not people that physically crossed the southern border or northern border. They are visa overstayers."" That’s supported by the nearly eight-year-old estimate created by the Pew Hispanic Center, though it was based on calculations suggesting overstayers could comprise as few as 38 percent of illegal residents up to half of them. This range and the age of the estimate amount to additional information missing from Castro's claim, which we rate as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Economy', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'Eric Cantor']","
Eric Cantor says Dave Brat served as economic adviser to Tim Kaine
","U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor, R-7th, has launched a TV ad accusing his primary election opponent,  Randolph-Macon College professor Dave Brat, of being a closet liberal. ""Brat worked on Democrat Gov. Tim Kaine’s Council of Economic Advisers while Kaine tried to raise our taxes by over $1 billion,"" the announcer says. Brat complained to us that the ad perpetuates ""a lie"" that ""I am behind the large tax increases of Kaine."" So we decided to examine the facts in Cantor’s ad statement and it’s implication that Brat counseled Kaine, who was governor from 2006 to 2010, on tax policies. Cantor’s campaign provides backup for the ad on the website http://wecheckthefacts.com/. The site says, ""Professor Brat proudly accepted an appointment by Gov. Tim Kaine to serve on his Board of Economists."" It links to a state Senate resolution confirming Kaine’s 2006 appointment of Brat and 11 others to the panel. The group, now known as the Joint Advisory Board of Economists, or JABE, helps the state’s Finance Department refine predictions for the state’s economy as part of the governor’s annual budget proposal process. Board members do not receive compensation. Finance Secretary Ric Brown -- who has served in his post under governors from both parties, including Kaine -- said the board weighs in on a national economic forecast prepared by Global Insight and a Virginia forecast offered by the state Department of Taxation. The panel seeks consensus of variables such as anticipated unemployment, wages and inflation. The board members ""respond to forecasts in terms of their areas of expertise,"" Brown told us. ""They do not do revenue, but they do the economic underpinnings."" After a consensus is reached on the direction of the state economy for the next year, the Taxation Department prepares two or three projections for Virginia revenues. Those estimates are reviewed by another board, the Governor’s Advisory Council on Revenue Estimates. This group -- consisting of the governor, senior legislators and chief executives from major companies in Virginia -- reaches a consensus for the revenues projections that the governor folds into his proposed budget. Brown described JABE, the board Brat served on, as ""part of an overall process that does feed into the revenue process and policy changes."" But he said the board does not make tax recommendations. Brat and the 11 other JABE members appointed by Kaine all had doctoral degrees in economics. Ten of the 12 were appointed to council by several governors and served multiple terms. Eight of them, including Brat, were appointed by both Democratic and Republican governors. Brat was first named to panel by Kaine and reappointed by Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican. Two of economists, Christine Chmura of Richmond and Roy Pearson of Williamsburg, have served under six governors. Another, Roy Webb of Richmond, has served under five governors. Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who took office in January, has not yet made appointments to the council. Now, let’s address Kaine’s tax-increase record. Cantor’s website linked to several articles from the Richmond Times-Dispatch and PolitiFact Virginia. In 2011, we found that Kaine had unsuccessfully proposed about $4 billion in tax hikes during his administration. He twice sought increases of about $1 billion in transportation taxes. He also proposed a $1.9 billion increase in income taxes, offset by a $650 million cut in local car taxes. Ray Allen Jr., a political adviser to Cantor, emailed us that the ad contains two ""facts which are not in dispute,"" referring to Brat’s service on the advisory panel and Kaine’s efforts to raise taxes. ""There is no public record of the professor ever disagreeing with Gov. Kaine on taxes,"" Allen wrote. Our ruling Cantor’s TV ad says, ""Brat worked on Democrat Gov. Tim Kaine’s Council of Economic Advisors while Kaine tried to raise our taxes by over $1 billion."" Brat clearly served on the panel and Kaine clearly sought tax hikes. The ad does not explicitly say these two events are connected, but mentioning them in the same sentence creates an unfair impression that Brat was part of a group that advised Kaine to raise taxes. There’s no evidence that occurred. The panel, as pointed out by the state’s long-serving secretary of finance, weighed in on the direction of the state’s economy. It did not advise the governor on revenue and tax policies. Cantor’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB82A80>],/factchecks/2014/apr/28/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-dave-brat-advised-served-economic/
"['Legal Issues', 'States', 'PunditFact', 'Andrew Napolitano']","
Napolitano: Washington lacks constitutional right to own land in Western states
","As we heard over and over during the Nevada standoff between federal agents and Cliven Bundy and his gun-bearing supporters, this fight wasn’t about cows or tortoises, it was about land and who controls it. For Bundy, the starting point was clear. ""I don’t recognize the United States government as even existing,"" Bundy said in an April 10 radio interview. Even in libertarian circles that is an extreme view, but Judge Andrew Napolitano of Fox News did lend his weight to the general argument that Washington is in the wrong. Napolitano was talking on Fox’s Hannity when the host pointed out Washington’s extensive holdings in the West. ""Look at the percentage they own in Nevada, 81 percent. Utah, 66 percent. Idaho, 61 percent,"" Hannity said. ""Why does the government own all of this land anyway?"" ""Sean, I'm going to make a statement that the government will consider outrageous,"" Napolitano warned. ""The Constitution simply does not authorize the federal government to own any of this land. All of it is being held unconstitutionally and all of it should be returned to the private property owners from which it was taken or to the states in which it exists, period."" We wanted to hear Napolitano’s legal explanation, but he did not get back to us. However, he is not the first to make this claim and we were able to review the legal record to see whether the federal government lacks the constitutional authority as he said. The short answer is that the Constitution, through the Property Clause, specifically gives the government the power to own land. Over time, the Supreme Court has ruled that not only does the government own the land, but it enjoys broad rights in deciding what happens on that land. In 2007, the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm that works on behalf of Democrats and Republicans, explored the legal roots of federal land ownership. Its finding was unambiguous. ""The Property Clause gives Congress authority over federal property generally, and the Supreme Court has described Congress’ power to legislate under this Clause as ‘without limitation,’ "" the researcher wrote. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank and activist organization in Washington, D.C., says much the same thing on its online guide to the Constitution. It provides the key text from Article IV of the Constitution. ""The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States."" The accompanying essay, by Columbia Law School professor Thomas Merrill, noted that many people have debated the scope of this clause. The most narrow interpretation, Merrill wrote, ""simply allows Congress to act as an ordinary owner of land. It can set policy regarding whether such lands will be sold or retained and, if they are retained, who may enter these lands and for what purposes."" For the purposes of this fact-check, even that limited approach leaves Napolitano high and dry. We asked another legal scholar at Heritage, John Malcolm, if we were misinterpreting anything. Malcolm told us we had it right. ""I’m not aware of anything in the Constitution that would preclude the federal government from owning land in these western states,"" Malcolm told PunditFact. Critics of Malcolm’s view point to an 1845 Supreme Court decision having to do with control over rivers and other navigable waterways. The nut of this ruling, as we read on the libertarian website Armstrong Economics, is that ""once a territory becomes a state, the (federal government) must surrender all claims to the land."" This argument has special relevance for states such as Nevada and Utah that were formed from large swaths of land owned by Washington. By this legal logic, when those states entered the Union, the federal government lost the ability to own land there. But according to the Congressional Research Service, that interpretation is ""contrary to the plain wording of the Constitution."" On top of that, under the law that created Nevada in 1864, the state specifically agreed to give up any claim to ""unappropriated public lands lying within said territory, and that the same shall be and remain at the sole and entire disposition of the United States."" For you history buffs, the United States acquired the land (see map) that became Nevada, California, Utah, plus chunks of New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona from Mexico in 1848 through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the Mexican-American War. Mexico also ditched any claim to Texas. In exchange, the United States paid Mexico $15 million. Napolitano said the land should be returned but given this chain of title, it is hard to see who would have any claim. We doubt he is thinking of Mexico. That Congressional Research Service report along with Heritage Foundation’s guide note that since 1845, the Supreme Court has issued many decisions that strengthen the government’s hand. An 1897 case said Congress could block someone from putting up fences on private land if it blocked access to public land. In 1911, the court affirmed the use of large tracts of land as national forests, held in the public interest. John Leshy is a professor of real property law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law. Leshy served in the Interior Department in the Carter and Clinton administrations and was part of the transition team when President Barack Obama first took office. ""Napolitano’s statement is absurd,"" Leshy said. ""The constitutional basis of federal land ownership is not subject to any serious debate among scholars, and hasn’t been for a very long time."" Our ruling Napolitano said the federal government has no constitutional authority to own land in many Western states. The underlying legal argument rests on a tenuous interpretation of constitutional language and the rejection of about 125 years of Supreme Court decisions. The legal scholars we reached, regardless of any political leanings they might have, agreed that the Constitution clearly grants Washington the power to own land and that arguments to the contrary are baseless. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA5C080>],/factchecks/2014/apr/28/andrew-napolitano/napolitano-washington-lacks-constitutional-right-o/

As Rick Scott and Charlie Crist battle for Hispanic vote, a Miami-Dade Democratic leader overstates the share of the Hispanic vote
","As Republican Gov. Rick Scott and his rival, Democrat Charlie Crist, battle for the support of Hispanic voters, they have attacked each other over everything from in-state tuition for young people who came to the United States illegally to the longstanding embargo of Cuba to what was, or wasn’t, said by certain Scott campaign staffers en route to a Chipotle. Such politicking shows how important both candidates believe Hispanics to be in this year’s campaign for Florida’s governor. One key battleground is Miami-Dade County, home to the largest number of Hispanic voters in the state, as well as Scott’s running mate, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera. Miami-Dade Democratic chair Annette Taddeo-Goldstein, who was born in Colombia, boasted about the size of the Hispanic vote in Florida in an April 21 interview with MSNBC Ed Schultz. Taddeo-Goldstein: ""I’m not surprised (Scott is) trying to pander to the Hispanic community, because our vote is actually, in my opinion, going to decide this election."" Schultz: ""You believe that the Latino vote will decide the gubernatorial election here in Florida?"" Taddeo-Goldstein: ""Now the Hispanics in Florida account for one in four of every resident in Florida. It is actually the largest in the country when it comes to the percentages. Over 20 percent of the electorate is Hispanic. So it’s going to be decided by Hispanics."" We can’t fact-check her prediction that Hispanic voters will decide the race, but we can fact-check her claim about the size of the Hispanic electorate. First, we’ll offer some background about why the Hispanic vote in Florida is in play. According to party registration statistics, Hispanics lean Democratic, but in actual voting patterns, the Hispanic vote is more competitive between the parties. While President Barack Obama overwhelmingly won the state’s Hispanic vote in 2012, Hispanics narrowly backed Scott in 2010, according to exit polls, though there was a large margin of error. Even Miami-Dade’s Cuban-American vote, historically a reliable base for GOP candidates, is becoming more competitive over time. Florida’s Hispanic electorate Taddeo-Goldstein was correct in her recitation of statistics about the Hispanic population in Florida and nationally. However, she was wrong on the percentage of registered voters who are Hispanic in Florida. As of October 2012, there were about 1.66 million registered Hispanic voters out of 11.9 million voters total, or 13.9 percent, according to the Florida Division of Elections. Susan MacManus, a University of South Florida political science professor, obtained more recent data from the state and shared the totals with PolitiFact Florida. As of the end of 2013, she said, about 14.2 percent of the state’s electorate was Hispanic. This data comes with some caveats. The state added ""Hispanic"" to voter registration in 1995, so it doesn’t reflect Hispanic voters who registered before that date. And the field is optional on voter registration forms. Such factors do raise uncertainties, said Dario Moreno, a pollster and Florida International University political science professor. Moreno said he’s not convinced that the state’s data fully captures the Hispanic share of the electorate.  He said that since voters have to self-report their heritage on the forms, some may be reluctant to share the information or be confused about race versus ethnicity. He thinks it could be at least 15 percent. Political organizations, campaigns and other entities purchase data from firms that collect voter registration data also found higher figures for Florida’s Hispanic electorate, though still less than 20 percent.   Univision reports that 18 percent of Florida’s electorate is Hispanic as of November 2013, based on data from the firm Aristotle, which compiles data from elections offices. Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials said their information shows Florida’s Hispanic electorate at 15 percent of the state's voters as of November 2013. When PolitiFact Florida contacted Taddeo-Goldstein for this fact check, she acknowledged that she should have said ""residents,"" rather than ""electorate."" ""Thanks for checking on this and for correcting me,"" she said. Our ruling Taddeo-Goldstein said that ""over 20 percent of the (Florida) electorate is Hispanic."" While more than 20 percent of the state’s population is Hispanic -- 23 percent to be exact -- the percentage of Hispanic registered voters is lower. State data shows that 13.9 percent of the state’s registered voters were Hispanic as of October 2012, a number that had climbed to 14.2 percent by the end of 2013. If adjustments are made for the fact that the data is self-reported and doesn't include some voter registrations made years ago, the figure likely approaches 20 percent, but doesn't necessarily get all the way there.

Now this year, the entire General Assembly is up for re-election, and Balfour has three challengers, including two in the fast-approaching May 20 Republican primary. Balfour recently sent out a campaign flier to voters talking about the trial, his acquittal and a judge ‘s ruling that he be reimbursed by the state for his $156,000 defense. The flier also says he rejected the chance to lawfully collect tens of thousands of dollars from the state, and hence, taxpayers. ""I am the only senator who turned down the state pension plan for part-time legislators,"" Balfour states in the flier. He goes on to say ""this saved taxpayers over $160,000 I could have claimed."" This is red meat for the scribes at PolitiFact Georgia. Fact check here we come. We reached out to officials at the state Employee Retirement System. They confirmed that they had supplied Balfour’s office with information that he was the only one of Georgia’s 56 senators who had declined membership in the Legislative Retirement System. Georgia’s part-time lawmakers currently earn $17,341 a year and are eligible for a daily per diem of $173 to cover travel costs when they are on legislative business, which includes committee meetings and the 40-day annual General Assembly session. They also are eligible to receive a lifetime benefit of $792 a month at age 62 if they have been making contributions to the legislative pension plan for at least 22 years, according to the ERS. That adds up to $9,504 a year, or about $160,000 after 16.8 years by ERS calculations. Balfour, who was first elected to the state Senate in 1992, says in the flier that, on principle, he never signed up for the pension plan. ""Nobody in the private sector gets a guaranteed retirement plan for a part-time job and neither should a state legislator,"" he states. Others under the Gold Dome clearly don’t share that philosophy. Of 236 state legislators -- 56 senators and 180 House members -- 223 were active in the Legislative Retirement System as of June 30, 2013, said Jim Potvin, the ERS’ executive director. One other senator isn’t taking the pension, though that wasn’t discovered until Balfour’s office had been told he was the only one, ERS staff said. As of June, 259 retired legislators and beneficiaries were collectively receiving $1.8 million a year, or about $587 month each, Potvin said. Benefits are calculated based on a legislator’s age, years of service and a benefit formula factor, $36 a year. It’s not all free money. Legislators contribute 3.75 percent of their monthly salary, and the state provides a 4.75 percent match, Potvin said. Legislators are vested after eight years of service, he said. Balfour, a Waffle House executive, has three challengers in this year’s elections. In his own party, he faces former Gwinnett County Commissioner Mike Beaudreau and former Lawrenceville City Councilman P.K. Martin. If he survives the primary, he’ll go up against Democrat Timothy Andrew Swiney, a real estate broker from Lawrenceville, in the November general election. In summary: The state Employee Retirement System told Balfour’s office that he was the only one of Georgia’s 56 state senators who has refused a state pension. He repeated that statement in a flier that he sent out to constitutes. When we contacted ERS officials last week, they told us they had ""since discovered there is another senator who is not a member of LRS."" Our ruling: Balfour’s campaign flier says he is the only senator who has not signed up for a legislative pension. He made the claim based on information his office had been given by the state Employee Retirement System. We rate Balfour’s statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE3B1C0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/28/don-balfour/balfour-declined-legislative-pension/

Menendez: 'White family is likely to have 6 times as much wealth as a black or Hispanic family coming out of the recession'
","ABC’s This Week spent much of their show Sunday discussing race issues, from affirmative action to racist comments allegedly made by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling to economic disparity. During a roundtable segment on the difference between the middle class in the United States and Canada, Fusion reporter Alicia Menendez argued that differences in wealth aren’t just generational, they’re racial. ""We also know that there is a racial component to this, that a white family is likely to have about six times as much wealth than a black or Hispanic family coming out of the recession,"" she said. PunditFact finds her ratio correct. Menendez pointed us to an April 2013 report from the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan social policy think-tank. The institute measured mean wealth by race. Using 2010 data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, the Urban Institute looked at assets including cash savings, homes, retirement accounts and subtracted any debt. The Urban Institute concluded that, post-recession, for every $1 an average black or Hispanic person has in wealth, an average white person has $6. That’s up from 1983, the farthest back the study goes, when the ratio was 5-to-1. Thomas Shapiro, a Brandeis University social policy professor who studies the wage gap, said the 6-to-1 ratio is correct, but represents the lower end of the wealth gap range researchers have come up with. At the higher end of the spectrum, Pew Research cited a 20-to-1 ratio in 2011. They took median wealth from the Census Bureau’s Survey of Income and Program Participation 2009 data. So the data varies by survey used, year and measure of average (mean vs median). There’s debate among economists and social scientists about which ratio is the most accurate. Darrick Hamilton, an urban policy professor at The New School, said the Census Bureau surveys more low-income families, while the Survey of Consumer Finances oversamples high-income families where minorities aren’t as well represented. Overall, any ratio from 6-to-1 to 22-to-1 could be considered an accurate measure of the wealth gap, Shapiro told us. Our ruling Menendez said, ""A white family is likely to have about six times as much wealth than a black or Hispanic family coming out of the recession."" A study from the Urban Institute supports her statistic. Other research shows an even wider gap, further proving her point that race is a factor in U.S. wealth. Menendez's statement is accurate, and might even understate the issue. We rate her claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE4F3C0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/27/alicia-menendez/menendez-white-family-likely-have-6-times-much-wea/

Tanden: '95 percent of the income gains in the last few years have gone to the top 1 percent'
","With most political handicappers giving Republicans the edge in the 2014 midterm elections, the pundits get to debate whether Democrats can rally their base and beat the odds. A primary question is whether the country’s struggle with income inequality offers the Democratic party the toe hold with voters that it needs. Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s new book A Fighting Chance gave the panelists on NBC’s Meet the Press an opening to bat this about. Neera Tanden, head of the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning group, argued that the issue not only would work well among the party faithful but beyond. ""95 percent of the income gains in the last few years have gone to the top 1 percent, That's a fact in the country,"" Tanden said. ""I think this is going to be an issue on both the right and the left."" The claim that the top earners have done extremely well coming out of the Great Recession has come up before. While there is some debate over the details, in large measure, Tanden is on solid ground. The statement goes back to a study from University of California-Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez. In the years from 2009 to 2012, Saez found that the income flowing to families in the top 1 percent of  families went up by over 30 percent, while for the rest, income grew by less than half a percent.   ""Hence, the top 1 percent captured 95 percent of the income gains in the first three years of the recovery,"" Saez wrote. The main caveat with Saez’s work is that he used preliminary data for 2012 and didn’t include two significant kinds of income -- money from the government (Social Security, welfare, food stamps, etc.) or  the value of health insurance benefits. Saez focused on employment wages, capital gains, dividends and interest. So Tanden has her numbers right by Saez’s figuring, but what you count as income makes a difference. We’ll now walk you through some other ways of looking at this question. Other interpretations, analysis We came across a study that measured income differently than Saez -- by measuring capital gains regardless of whether the owner cashed out and including government assistance programs. That study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, found a wide income disparity as well, but noted that the gap actually narrowed between 1989 and 2007. There’s another argument that it makes more sense to calculate consumption rather than income. Economist Aparna Marthur with the American Enterprise Institute, a free-market oriented think-tank in Washington, believes what people spend shows you how well people are actually living, and it doesn’t matter if they pay for it using credit cards, their weekly paycheck or their savings. Viewed this way, the situation is not as bad. ""We find that consumption inequality is much narrower than income inequality,"" Marthur said. ""And has shown no trend towards widening over the last few decades."" Marthur’s perspective is fuel for a policy debate that goes far beyond what we are writing about here, but there is one other criticism of Saez’s analysis. Eugene Steurele, a fellow at the Urban Institute, a D.C-based academic center, warned about using 2009, the very bottom of the recession, as the starting point. ""The economic cycle messes up this comparison,"" Steurele told PunditFact in January. ""In recovering from a recession, if an unemployed person stays with the same unemployment benefits, and a wage earner doesn’t increase her wages, but the stock market recovers enough so there are more capital gains, then one might get these types of results."" Steurele said Saez’s findings are useful but his approach simplifies a complex situation. Work by the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan policy analysis arm of Congress, goes at least part way toward addressing Steurele’s concern. A 2011 report chose two points at the same place in the economic cycle, 1996 and 2006. It also factored in taxes and if its results are not exactly comparable to the Saez article, they point in the same direction. ""The poorest tax filers (the bottom fifth) saw average after-tax income fall by 6 percent between 1996 and 2006,"" the report said. While ""the richest 1 percent of tax filers experienced a 74 percent increase in after-tax income."" The main reason for the widening gap was the rapid growth in capital gains and dividends income among the wealthy, the Congressional Research Service concluded. The latest annual review of data by the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality found that ""after the Great Recession ended in mid-2009, income and consumption inequality increased."" The report noted that households in the bottom fifth of the income ladder received 3.4 percent of all income in 2012. However, going back to the pundits' debate over how this will play out in the voting booth, one statistic might give the Democrats some concern. The Pew Research Center, an independent study group, found that Americans are not too worried about income inequality. In the center’s 2013 survey of global attitudes, barely half of Americans said the rich-poor gap is a very big problem. Our ruling Tanden said that 95 percent of the income gains have gone to the top 1 percent of earners. Tanden accurately reflected the findings of a much publicized report. Other studies confirm the overall trend in that report, although the disparities in gains between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else are not always as large as Tanden said and depend on how you define income. Tanden’s statement is accurate but in need of clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE4FC40>],/factchecks/2014/apr/27/neera-tanden/tanden-95-percent-income-gains-last-few-years-have/
