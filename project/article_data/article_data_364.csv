Donald Trump weaves Joe Biden into his false claims about the border wall
","As he accepted the Republican nomination for reelection, President Donald Trump claimed that Joe Biden’s immigration plan would disadvantage Americans. Speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, Trump also claimed his Democratic opponent would undo one of Trump’s proudest undertakings: the construction of border barriers. ""The Biden plan would eliminate America's borders in the middle of a global pandemic,"" Trump said Aug. 27. ""And he is even talking about taking the wall down. How about that?"" Is that right? No. Biden does not plan to eliminate American’s borders, and he has not said he would demolish border construction done by the Trump administration. This fact-check will focus on the wall claim. We asked the White House and Trump’s re-election campaign for evidence that backed Trump’s claim. We didn’t hear back. RELATED: Fact-checking Donald Trump's 2020 RNC speech Biden has not said he would take down barriers built at the border. What he has said is that he wouldn’t build more of them. ""Trump campaigned on ‘Build that wall.’ Are you willing to tear that wall down?"" NPR’s Lulu Garcia-Navarro asked Biden in an interview aired Aug. 6. ""No. There will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration, No. 1,"" Biden answered. ""No. 2, … I'm going to make sure that we have border protection, but it's going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it and at the ports of entry. That's where all bad stuff is happening."" Biden’s immigration plan says that most contraband comes into the United States through legal ports of entry and that nearly half of the people who are illegally in the country overstayed a visa, rather than crossed a border illegally. Trump has misallocated resources by focusing on a border wall, Biden argues. If elected president, Biden says, he would ""direct federal resources to smart border enforcement efforts,"" such as cameras, sensors, large-scale X-ray machines, and fixed towers at and between ports of entry. ""Like every nation, the U.S. has a right and a duty to secure our borders and protect our people against threats,"" Biden’s plan says. ""But we know that immigrants and immigrant communities are not a threat to our security, and the government should never use xenophobia or fear tactics to scare voters for political gain."" Tearing down border barriers also isn’t among the policy recommendations of a task force that Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., appointed to help unify Democrats. In his acceptance speech and in previous speeches Trump has mischaracterized several elements of the task force’s recommendations. The task force called Trump’s border barriers ""unnecessary, wasteful, and ineffective,"" but did not propose taking them down. It’s worth noting that there’s not much new border wall to take down. Trump’s repeated boasts that he has ""built 300 miles of border wall"" are wrong. What he’s referring to is mostly the replacement of older barriers with new fences, not new barriers in unprotected areas. Before Trump took office, the nearly 2,000-mile southern border had 654 miles of primary barriers (the first physical impediment a border crosser may face). More than three years into Trump’s presidency, that has increased by 5 miles. RELATED: Donald Trump promised to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it. That didn’t happen Trump said Biden ""is even talking about taking the wall down."" Biden has not said that. Biden opposes construction of barriers at the border, but has not said he would demolish existing structures. Trump’s claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.

Obama-era shift to electronic Social Security payments wasn’t due to concerns over USPS
","President Donald Trump has made a target of the U.S. Postal Service by raising spurious concerns about the security of mail-in ballots. And now misinformation targeting the Postal Service is gaining traction on social media. One Facebook post claims that there were concerns about the security of U.S. mail service when President Barack Obama was in office. ""Did you know in 2013 obama determined Social Security would not send checks through the USPS, because it was not secure!?"" the post reads.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  During the Obama administration, Social Security payments did largely shift to electronic delivery. But the post errs in saying the shift was due to concerns about the security of the Postal Service.  Each month, the U.S. Treasury sends payments for Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits to 69 million recipients around the country. Until 2010, about 16% were done by mailed checks and 84% were done electronically through direct deposit or through debit cards that could be automatically replenished. In April 2010 — just a few days before Earth Day — the Treasury Department announced a rule that would increase the number of electronic Social Security transactions and decrease the number of mailed checks by 2013. The change was expected to save ""more than $400 million and 12 million pounds of paper in the first five years alone,"" according to the Treasury Department press release. ""By moving to all-electronic payments, Treasury will save hundreds of millions of dollars and substantially reduce our environmental impact, making this a win-win for all Americans,"" then-Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said in a statement. News coverage of the new rule focused on the fact that electronic deposits would save taxpayer money, reduce the Social Security Administration’s environmental impact and provide increased security for the payments.  In a 2011 Social Security Administration press release, Michael Astrue, commissioner of Social Security, said getting benefit payments by direct deposit or on a debit card was safe and reliable. ""You don't have to worry about your check being lost or stolen, and your money is available immediately on your payment date,"" Astrue said. ""There is no need to wait for the mail to arrive."" Testifying before a Senate committee in 2013, Theresa Gruber, assistant deputy commissioner for operations at the Social Security Administration, pointed out that electronic Social Security payments do not face the same disruption that mailed checks face from natural disasters such as hurricanes. She also said paper checks are more likely to be lost or stolen than electronic deposits. A spokesperson for the Social Security Administration told PolitiFact that the push to switch to primarily direct deposit was not at all related to concerns about the security of mailing checks via the Postal Service. ""Direct deposit is a secure and convenient method for people to receive their benefits,"" the spokesperson said. ""Their money is immediately available in their account at their financial institution, making a separate trip to their bank with a paper check unnecessary — especially important for people with transportation or mobility issues, in bad weather, or when natural disasters strike.""  He added that the 2013 shift was part of a government-wide initiative led by the Treasury to move to electronic benefit delivery. The plan was to ""phase out"" paper checks by March 1, 2013. But in some circumstances, people could apply for waivers that would allow them to continue receiving paper checks. By 2014, 98.6% of Social Security payments were made via direct deposit. Today, 99.1% of Social Security payments are made by direct deposit, leaving about 550,000 payments to be made via mailed checks each month, according to Social Security Administration data. Although officials referenced ""lost"" and ""stolen"" checks as a potential benefit of the switch to direct deposit payments, PolitiFact found no evidence the Obama administration enacted the rule because of concerns with the security of the Postal Service, as the post claims. A Facebook post said, ""in 2013 Obama determined Social Security would not send checks through the USPS, because it was not secure.""  The claim is misleading.  Officials said the switch to direct deposit Social Security payments was environmentally prudent and would save millions of taxpayer dollars. Officials also said direct deposit payments would prevent checks from being lost or stolen, but we found no evidence anyone argued the Postal Service was not a secure way to deliver checks.  More than half a million people still receive Social Security checks by mail today. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979D8E80>],/factchecks/2020/aug/28/facebook-posts/obama-era-shift-electronic-social-security-payment/

Yes, Trump Said He Offered Russia Help With Wildfires. No, He Didn’t Deny California Fire Assistance
","UPDATE: Nearly two months after we published our fact check, the Trump administration on Oct. 15, 2020 rejected California’s subsequent request for disaster relief for six major wildfires, including the Creek Fire near Fresno. A White House spokesman told The New York Times that President Donald Trump had already come to the state’s assistance by authorizing funds for fires earlier this year and that data on the recent fires did not meet a threshold for federal help. California officials planned to appeal. Our rating of False on the Aug. 23 Facebook post remains the same as we decide our ratings based on the information available at the time. On Oct. 16, 2020, the Trump administration reversed course and approved California's request.  President Trump has repeatedly threatened to withhold federal wildfire assistance to California, including last week as hundreds of lightning-sparked blazes burned across the state’s northern and central regions. He’s also made numerous false and oversimplified claims about what’s driving these infernos, reducing the complex matter to a need to remove ""leaves, debris and fallen trees,"" from the forest floor.  But has Trump ever ""denied fire assistance"" to the Golden State? And did he really help Russia with their fires in Siberia?  That’s the claim in a viral Facebook post published Aug. 23:   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook).  We decided to douse this fiery claim with a bucket of facts.  Did Trump ‘Deny’ Fire Aid To California?  Trump’s most recent threat to withhold assistance was Aug. 20 during a campaign speech in Pennsylvania: ""Maybe we're just going to have to make them pay for it, because they don't listen to us,"" Trump said at the event. ""We say, you've got to get rid of the leaves. You've got to get rid of the debris. You've got to get rid of the fallen trees."" Forestry and fire experts say dense material on forest floors can make fires worse. But that’s not what’s driving them. California’s extreme heat, a siege of lightning strikes and low humidity all combined to cause the current blazes, Keith Gilless, chairman of the California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection said last week. Given Trump’s repeated criticism of the state, some might assume he withheld the aid. But he didn’t.  Two days after the president’s threat, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the White House had approved the state’s request for a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration. The approval helps fire victims with crisis counseling, housing, unemployment assistance and legal services.   ""It also provides federal assistance to help state, tribal and local governments fund emergency response, recovery and protective measures,"" Newsom’s announcement reads. The same day Trump threatened to withhold aid, Newsom thanked the Trump administration for its help. He told the Associated Press that he has a ""strong personal relationship with the president."" ""While he may make statements publicly, the working relationship privately has been a very effective one,"" Newsom said, according to the AP.  Earlier in the month, on Aug. 18, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said in a news release it had ""authorized the use of federal funds"" to help the state fight the LNU Lightning Complex fire. As of Aug. 27, that set of fires in Napa, Lake, Solano and Yolo counties had burned nearly 369,000 acres, killed five people, injured four, destroyed 1,080 structures and damaged another 272, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. It was threatening another 30,500 structures and was 35% contained.  It is one of several massive fires burning in the state.  As for the post’s claim California ""didn’t vote"" for Trump, that is correct. Hillary Clinton received 61.5% of the state’s vote in the 2016 presidential election and nearly 4.3 million more votes than Trump. Did Trump Help Russia ‘With Their Wildfires In Siberia’?  It’s not clear Trump actually helped Russia with wildfires that burned across Siberia last year. But both Trump and Russia say he offered to. As Snopes.com reported last year, the Russian government published a statement about a phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on July 31, 2019: The statement reads: ""Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with US President Donald Trump this evening at the American side’s initiative. The US President offered help in putting out wildfires in Siberia. The President of Russia expressed sincere gratitude for the kind attention and the offer of help and assistance."" In the statement, Putin goes on to say he would accept the offer ""if it becomes necessary."" At a press conference the next day later, Trump told reporters he offered Russia help.  ""Mostly we discussed the forest fires in Siberia, and other parts of Russia. And I said, look, we have the greatest equipment, if we could help you let us know. Large sections are burning, and so I said to President Putin, if we can help you, let me know,"" Trump said.  We did not find any evidence he followed through and provided assistance to combat the fires in Siberia.  Our Rating A widely-shared Facebook post claims President Trump ""denied fire assistance"" to California but helped Russia with its wildfires in Siberia.  Trump has repeatedly said he would withhold fire assistance to the state, including last week as a set of massive blazes burned in California. But he didn’t follow through in the past or this time. Instead, we found announcements showing the White House approved federal assistance.  Last year, Trump said he offered Russia help in Siberia, but we found no evidence that he followed through on that pledge, either.  In the end, the viral post plays on some assumptions about Trump — that he disdains left-leaning California but supports the authoritarian Russian Federation. The problem is it takes some big and inaccurate leaps in the process.  We rated it False.  FALSE – The statement is not accurate.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F83040>],/factchecks/2020/aug/28/facebook-posts/yes-trump-said-he-offered-russia-help-wildfires-no/

Online post wrong about some claims on sex, gun offenses in Jacob Blake’s past
","Editor's note: This story has been updated to note that dispatch audio indicates responding officers were aware of Blake's warrant. This did not affect our rating. When Kenosha police shot a Black man in the back seven times, it launched a now all-too-familiar avalanche of reaction. Protests. Property damage. And an online rush to judgement fueled by each poster’s pre-existing position on social justice and the Black Lives Matter movement. Police shot Jacob Blake, 29, on the evening of Aug. 23, 2020, as he attempted to get into a small SUV with his three sons inside while officers aimed guns at him, according to officials and a bystander’s video of the incident that has been shared throughout the world. Blake survived, but his family’s attorney said he is paralyzed from the waist down At this stage, there are more questions than answers about what happened before the video was taken. Some of that may not be known for months, until an outside review by the state Department of Justice is completed. But we can address Blake’s background, which many posters have used to suggest is evidence that he is to blame for what happened. An Aug. 24, 2020, Facebook post shared thousands of times asserts Blake ""had an active warrant for domestic violence and sexual assault"" and ""has prior criminal convictions for illegal gun use."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Such allegations are a common and patently unfair response to tragic events that need to be corrected, said Daniel Medwed, professor of law and criminal justice at Northeastern University School of Law.  Attacks on a victim’s actions and background can impact both the court of public opinion and the ensuing criminal court actions, he said. ""You’re fighting in two different courts basically with a high-profile case, and victim-blaming can 'help' with both,"" Medwed said. ""The narrative seems to always be about the danger posed by the victim, to basically create a sentiment that police were in danger. … The implication from that is that because there’s something bad about their character they somehow deserved what they got, which is patently absurd and absolutely disgusting."" Here’s what we know about Blake’s past contact with law enforcement. The first part of this claim is largely accurate. Blake was charged July 6, 2020, with felony third-degree sexual assault and misdemeanor trespassing and disorderly conduct. All three offenses carried a penalty enhancer because they were connected to domestic abuse. The charges — which have not gone to trial — stem from a May 3, 2020, incident in Kenosha County. A woman Blake knew told police he came into her house about 6 a.m., sexually assaulted her and then took a debit card and car keys before fleeing in her vehicle, according to a criminal complaint. (Contrary to many social media claims, the woman involved in this case was an adult). A warrant for Blake’s arrest was filed the day after the criminal complaint, online court records show. Police radio traffic shows officers were dispatched for ""family trouble,"" and a dispatcher named Blake as taking the caller’s keys and refusing to give them back. A dispatcher used the police code 10-99 while sending officers, alerting them to Blake's warrant. The second element of the claim is wrong. Blake was charged with a gun-related offense in 2015, but he was not convicted. The Facebook post offered as proof a Sept. 22, 2015, article from the Racine County Eye website. It described charges being filed, but did not reference a conviction. Our review of court records shows a confrontation at a Racine County bar led to a combative traffic stop and a total of five criminal charges in September 2015, including resisting an officer, disorderly conduct and three gun-related ones. But those charges were later dismissed on a motion from prosecutors, said Racine County Clerk of Circuit Court Samuel Christensen. The court file said it was dismissed in February 2018 ""due to witness issues and age of case."" After this fact-check published, the Facebook page that posted the claim edited the post to note the error and correct the reference to a conviction. Since more than two years has passed since the case was dismissed, it is no longer visible via online court records, per a Wisconsin Supreme Court rule.  A viral Facebook post says Blake had a warrant for sexual assault and prior convictions for gun use. Blake did have an active warrant for sexual assault and several other crimes related to domestic violence at the time he was shot. But Blake was not convicted of any prior gun offenses. Charges filed in 2015 were ultimately dismissed at the request of prosecutors. We rate this claim Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CE22C0>],/factchecks/2020/aug/27/facebook-posts/online-post-wrong-about-some-claims-sex-gun-offens/

Tuberville did say he ‘wouldn’t have a clue’ on COVID-19, but has said more
","Sen. Doug Jones, an Alabama Democrat who could face an uphill battle for re-election against Republican Tommy Tuberville, is attacking the former college football coach as something of a know-nothing on a critical subject: the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic. Jones made the attack on Tuberville in an Aug. 7 interview with Alabama Public Television host Don Dailey.  ""He’s never been challenged on the issues, Don, and that’s the key,"" Jones said. ""In April, he said on a radio show, when asked how he would handle the pandemic, he said he didn’t have a clue. Just right after the Republican nomination, he was asked the same question and he still said he didn’t have a clue."" Jones also posted that clip from the ""Capitol Journal"" show on Facebook. Tuberville did say, in March, he ""didn’t have a clue"" on how to handle COVID-19 and in July said, ""I don’t know which way you go."" He has not laid out a plan for addressing the virus, though he has taken some positions on pandemic-related shutdowns and federal emergency aid. Tuberville’s campaign referred us to statements he has made in support of sending children back to school and restarting sports. Tuberville, who had his greatest success as a football coach at Auburn University in Alabama, is making his first run for public office. He’s challenging Jones, who won a special election in December 2017 for the seat vacated by Republican Jeff Sessions, who became President Donald Trump’s first attorney general. The outcome of their Nov. 3 race could help determine whether Republicans keep a majority in the Senate, where they now control 53 seats. As of Aug. 17, the race is rated as ""lean Republican"" by the Cook Political Report. To back Jones’ attack, his campaign cited two Tuberville radio interviews. 1. ""Wouldn’t have a clue"": Birmingham talk show co-host Matt Murphy asked Tuberville on March 19 if he agreed with the Trump administration on sending stimulus checks to people in response to the coronavirus pandemic.  ""I’d have to look at it, Matt, because we don’t have the money, number one,"" Tuberville said, adding that it was unknown how many people would need the financial assistance. ""The unknown is what is so tough here and that's the reason, the decision's going to have to be made from just a group of people in the White House and hopefully a few people, people in the Senate and the House of making the decision for the people and take politics out of it."" He added:  ""The decision is basically two words. You’re either going to pay or you’re going to send people back to work, at the end of the day. And they know a lot more about the situation than we do. They’ve got all the facts and figures and they’re working around the clock. So, to make a decision from my standpoint, I wouldn’t have a clue. It’d be like putting a game plan together and not be around it and all of a sudden trying to call plays, not knowing what the defense does. You’ve got to know everything around you."" 2. ""Don’t know which way you go"": On July 17, Rick Burgess, co-host of a Birmingham show, raised COVID-19 and asked: ""What would be your approach to what’s going on?"" After saying that initially the pandemic might have been ""overblown to a point,"" and then making a reference to how Sweden responded, Tuberville replied: ""The thing you’ve got to remember — five, eight years ago, we couldn’t have done that; technology-wise, we couldn’t have shut the country down like we did. We didn’t have the Zooms and all those things that we could continue to work, and we would have just fought through it. I think that technology gives us an easier out in terms of saying, Shut everybody down."" He added: ""I tell you, we’ve got to work through this. But I tell you, it’s an unseen virus. We know very little about it. We’re learning more about it. The previous administration just left us without any kind of medical supplies. President Trump’s had to dig deep. And boy, he’s taken a lot of hits. But I don’t know which way you go, at the end of the day, whether you’re right or wrong, or anything that you do with this. Because, we’ve got to just fight through it ourselves and mentally fight back."" Tuberville has not laid out a plan for addressing COVID-19 and has sometimes downplayed its seriousness. He highlights 10 issues on his campaign website, including health care, but COVID-19 is not mentioned.  In July, Tuberville raised funds and held face-to-face meetings in Washington, D.C., defying orders from the city that visitors from certain coronavirus hot spots quarantine upon arrival, the Washington Post reported. ""The D.C. Democrat mayor’s order specifically applies only to nonessential travel, and Coach Tuberville was not up there sightseeing,"" his campaign responded in a statement. But we found that Tuberville has expressed some opinions on the response to the pandemic, especially in the education and athletic contexts: For playing football, returning to school: ""We have to put our kids in a school — keep them protected, be socially responsible — but we need to get back to school and get back to normal life,"" Tuberville said Aug. 12 on Fox News. He also said college football should be played this fall: ""There’s nobody more protected than college athletes and high school athletes. They have doctors, they have ways to wash their clothes that get them disinfected."" Against extending unemployment aid: Tuberville opposed extending a $600-per-week federal bonus on unemployment checks as being ""way too much."" He said, according to an Aug. 6 AL.com report: ""We’re having people just sit out not working because they’re making more sitting around. We’ve got to go back to work."" On investigating the origins of the virus: Asked about whether China should be investigated regarding the origins of the coronavirus, Tuberville said it should, according to a May 7 report from WPMI-TV in Mobile. He added: ""I trust President Trump to get us out of it, and everybody wants to start pointing fingers. We don’t need to point fingers until we get out of it, then we can hold whoever’s accountable, accountable."" Tuberville’s campaign referred us to a July 23 radio interview it described as representative of statements Tuberville has made on COVID-19. On that show, Tuberville noted that the virus affects people differently, complained that medical experts such as Dr. Anthony Fauci have often been wrong about the virus, and said: ""If you need to wear a mask, wear a mask.""  He reiterated that kids need to return to school, perhaps with modifications for children or teachers who have health risks. ""These people make a lot of money, these superintendents and principals. They can figure out a way to make it safe for the teachers and the kids. We’ve got to get back to school and we’ve got to get back to athletics,"" he said. Our ruling Tuberville did say in March he ""wouldn’t have a clue"" about whether to make stimulus payments to Americans unemployed by the pandemic or to send them back to work. And in July, when asked what his approach to the pandemic would be, he said: ""But I don’t know which way you go, at the end of the day, whether you’re right or wrong, or anything that you do with this."" Tuberville also has not laid out a plan for what he would do about COVID-19, but he has stated some positions, including that people should return to work and children should return to school.

A cosmetology license takes more training hours than policing, but comparison oversimplifies
","Editor's note: This item was updated to reflect that officers may be permitted up to five years to attain an associate's degree. This does  not change our rating. Police are under a national microscope after a Kenosha officer repeatedly shot a Black man in the back.  A video of the Aug. 23, 2020, incident circulated widely on social media appeared to show a Kenosha police officer grabbing Jacob Blake by the back of his shirt as he tried to get into a small SUV before an officer shot Blake seven times at point-blank range. Three of Blake’s children were in the vehicle.  The shooting, which paralyzed Blake from the waist down, provoked protests in Kenosha and across the country over police brutality and its disproportionate impact on Black people. It also renewed criticism of police departments, which some say are overfunded and do not adequately train officers.  An Aug. 24, 2020, Facebook post shared more than 1,300 times underscored that message. ""Police training in Wisconsin is 21 weeks,"" the post said. ""A cosmetology license takes 40 weeks."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Is the post correct about the imbalance? In Wisconsin, both police officers and cosmetologists must undergo training before they can assume the job. But the processes are very different. According to the state Department of Safety and Professional Services, applicants for a cosmetology license must complete at least 1,550 hours — or about 39 weeks if you assume 40 hours per week — of training at a licensed cosmetology school. The program must last a minimum of 10 months.  Alternatively, aspiring cosmetologists can take two to four years to complete at least 4,000 hours of practical training and theoretical instruction through an apprenticeship. They must also have a high school diploma or the equivalent of one.  Approved candidates must then pass a practical and written exam, which can take up to 6.5 hours altogether. Those who succeed and meet all other requirements receive a license.  So, depending which measure you use, the Facebook post is either about right or vastly understated the amount of time required to obtain a cosmetology license.  It also doesn’t tell the full story about police training. As of 2016, anyone who applies to be a law enforcement officer or tribal law enforcement officer in Wisconsin must undergo 720 hours, or 18 weeks, of training — even less than what the Facebook post claimed. The training curriculum for jail and juvenile detention officers is 160 hours. According to a document from multiple statewide law enforcement groups, the 720-hour academy includes written exams, 40 hours of scenario-based evaluations and training on ethics, cultural competency and racial sensitivity.  However, training is only one part of the puzzle. Unlike cosmetologists, law enforcement officials employed after 1993, excluding jail and juvenile officers, must have an associate’s degree or at least 60 accredited college credits -- or attain one within five years. They must also undergo a medical assessment, background check, oral interview and drug test.  The Facebook post doesn’t factor in the degree requirement, which is a key difference in this comparison. Cosmetology training can begin right out of high school, while police officers typically would first complete at least a two-year degree. The post also doesn’t acknowledge the 24 hours of annual training officers must undergo to remain in law enforcement. Cosmetologists, by contrast, are no longer required to participate in continuing education and must read a digest of rule changes that occurred during the biennium when they renew their license. The Facebook poster did not respond to a request for comment. A widely-shared Facebook post in the aftermath of Blake’s shooting by Kenosha police said: ""Police training in Wisconsin is 21 weeks. A cosmetology license takes 40 weeks."" When you look only at training, cosmetologists are required to put in more time than police officers. The numbers in the Facebook post are slightly off and actually understate the gap, but the underlying point still stands.  That said, the post doesn’t account for the additional education requirements needed to become a police officer, nor the assessments they must undergo before they even begin training. That leaves us with a statement that’s partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate this Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973A77C0>],/factchecks/2020/aug/27/facebook-posts/cosmetology-license-takes-more-training-hours-poli/

No evidence that Jacob Blake “brandished” a knife, got a gun before police shooting in Kenosha
","Editor’s Note: Prosecutors revealed Jan. 5, 2021, that Jacob Blake was armed with a ""razor blade-type knife"" when he was shot by police. Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley said as a result the officer who shot Blake could successfully argue self-defense, and therefore wouldn’t face criminal charges. That does not affect the rating for this item because ratings are based on what is known at the time. When this statement was made in August 2020, it was not clear what Blake was holding or when, given the grainy cell phone video and lack of detail released by police. As we wait for a full Wisconsin Department of Justice report on the Jacob Blake shooting, speculation has run rampant online about whether the 29-year-old Kenosha man was armed — and with what — in the moments before a Kenosha police officer shot him seven times in the back. The lack of detailed information from law enforcement has only added to the speculation. That includes a widely shared Aug. 26, 2020, Facebook post that starts out blaring ""FACTS MATTER!!"" before asserting this: ""Jacob Blake declared he had a gun in the car and was going to go get it. He continued to brandish the knife while disregarding officer commands. When he reached into the car, officers fired. This is why they are burning down Kenosha, Wisconsin right now."" It was accompanied by a screen grab from an onlooker’s video of Blake, where an object in his hand is circled. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Here’s what we know. The Facebook post avoids directly claiming a gun, instead attributing statements to Blake about having and getting a gun. We don’t know what was said, and we may never know since the responding officers weren’t wearing body cameras. The Kenosha Police Department doesn’t use them. Audio in the cell-phone video shot by a witness is hard to discern due to bystanders’ shouts. So there’s no way to prove this part of the claim directly — though no witness reports have emerged since the incident that offer this account. The man who made the Facebook post did not respond to a request for the evidence behind the claim. But we know there was no gun. An Aug. 26, 2020, news release from the Department of Justice said officers found a knife on the driver’s side floorboard, but ""a search of the vehicle located no additional weapons."" The role of the knife is much less clear. The DOJ has not clarified whether the knife was on the floorboard throughout the confrontation, or if Blake may have held it at some point. Spokeswoman Gillian Drummond declined to answer that question when asked by PolitiFact Wisconsin on Aug. 27, 2020. Video taken by onlookers shows something in Blake’s hand, but the resolution is low, so it could be a knife, sunglasses or something else. The man who said he made the widely shared cellphone video of the shooting, 22-year-old Raysean White, told the Associated Press he heard officers yell, ""Drop the knife! Drop the knife!"" as they scuffled with Blake before the shooting.  White said he didn’t see a knife in Blake’s hands. The audio captured by White is inconclusive, though there is a phrase or two that could be interpreted as, ""Drop the knife."" Blake’s representatives have said he was unarmed. His father told the Chicago Sun-Times for an Aug. 25, 2020, story, ""My son didn’t have a weapon. He didn’t have a gun.""  Blake’s attorney, Ben Crump, said in a statement released Aug. 27, 2020, ""Jacob did nothing to provoke police. … Witnesses confirm that he was not in possession of a knife and didn’t threaten officers in any way."" But another attorney representing the Blake family, Patrick Salvi Jr., had told CNN the day before that Blake didn’t have a weapon in the vehicle, which turned out to not be true. What we do know is that referring to Blake as ""brandishing"" appears to be an exaggeration. Video of the shooting shows Blake walking around the front of the car with his back to officers and his left arm swinging at his side, grasping some object.  Brandishing is defined by Merriam-Webster as ""to shake or wave (something, such as a weapon) menacingly."" That’s not what the video shows. A viral Facebook post says Blake ""declared he had a gun in the car and was going to go get it"" and was ""brandishing"" a knife. We have no way of knowing for sure what Blake said, but we know there was no gun. And we don’t yet know if the knife police later found in the SUV was there throughout the confrontation or held by Blake at some point. But Blake was not ""brandishing"" anything in the video taken by bystanders. For our fact checks, the burden of proof is on the speaker. Due to the lack of evidence establishing these claims at this point, we rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F3CEC0>],/factchecks/2020/aug/27/facebook-posts/no-jacob-blake-did-not-brandish-knife-gun-kenosha/

Yes, police were 20.8 more likely to kill than be killed by a criminal in 2019
","Widespread condemnation of police brutality has picked up once again after Kenosha police shot Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, seven times at close range as he attempted to get into his SUV late in the afternoon of Aug. 23, 2020.  As Blake remained at a Milwaukee hospital, where his family’s attorneys say he is paralyzed from the waist down, protests developed in Kenosha and across the state. Politicians from both sides of the aisle have weighed in, including state Sen. Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, who wrote this in an Aug. 24, 2020, Facebook post: ""In 2019, 89 officers died in the line of duty. While every death is tragic, almost half (41) were accidental. That same year, officers shot and killed 999 people. Police are 20.8 times more likely to kill than be killed by a criminal. We must drastically reduce the use of deadly force in this country."" Is he correct that in 2019, police were ""20.8 times more likely to kill than be killed by a criminal.""  Is he correct?  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Let’s break down the numbers.  Police officer deaths vs. deaths caused by police, by the numbers  To back up his claim, Larson’s office cited statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the number of law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty during 2019.  According to those statistics, 89 officers were killed in such incidents last year. Forty-one of those officers were killed accidentally, the FBI says, most often in car accidents.  That leaves 48 of what the FBI calls ""felonious"" deaths, which are deaths caused by criminal acts.  Turning to the number of people killed by police last year, Larson’s office pointed to the Washington Post’s ""Fatal Force"" database, which since 2015 has been logging fatal shootings by on-duty police officers throughout the U.S. The Post tracks such cases by following local news, law enforcement websites and social media, submitting open records requests and verifying incidents with the police department in question.  In 2019, 999 people were shot and killed by police, according to the database.  In his Facebook post, Larson does the math: If criminal acts led to 48 officer deaths in 2019, and officers killed 999 people in the same year, that would make police approximately 20.8 times more likely to kill someone than be killed in a criminal act. The Post database breaks down another important data point: Black Americans are more likely to be shot and killed by police than white Americans. Black people account for less than 13% of the U.S. population but are killed by police at more than double the rate of white people  Black people are killed by police at a rate of 32 deaths per million people, Hispanic people at a rate of 24 per million, and white people at a rate of 13 per million, according to the database.  Larson said police are ""20.8 times more likely to kill than be killed by a criminal.""  FBI statistics and a national database show that checks out: In 2019, police killed 999 people, and 48 officers were killed by a criminal act in the line of duty.

","Amid the unrest over the shooting of Jacob Blake by a white police officer in Kenosha, Wis., on Aug. 23, misinformation has spread on social media.  One Facebook post shows a fiery scene behind a sign that says ""Bradford Community Church Unitarian Universalist"" with ""Black Lives Matter"" on the marquee.  ""BLM rioters just burned down a black church in a black community with a BLM sign out front,"" the Aug. 25 post says, describing the image.

""While we are relieved that our church home mostly survived the inferno in the lot next door, we affirm that we would rather lose 100 buildings than one more life to police violence."" In the photo that appears on Facebook, the fire behind the church’s sign is burning a used-car dealership next door, not the church. Ultimately, the church sign in the photo burned, but the church itself — which is to the left of the sign in the image — was only singed on one side. Everything else appears in working order, Carlson told us.  ""There is no indication the sign or the church were targets of the arsonists,"" Carlson said. He credited a couple of journalists who saw the fire in the car lot and realized it could spread to the church, dousing flames closest to the building using the church’s rain barrels and piling dirt on sparks using snow shovels from a shed behind the building.  The Facebook post claims that Bradford Community Church ""is a Black church in a Black community with a BLM sign out front."" The church’s sign did say ""Black Lives Matter,"" but Carlson, who is white, said ""we are far from a ‘Black’ church."" The vast majority of its members — historically and now — are white. The church is located in the city’s historic downtown area. It’s not really residential, Carlson said, though it is relatively close to what would be considered a Black neighborhood.  ""But I wouldn’t say that we’re in the middle of a Black community,"" he said.

No, James Madison didn't sign the Declaration of Independence
","Speaking at the Republican National Convention, 25-year-old congressional candidate Madison Cawthorn said that people who doubt young people ""don’t know American history."" Cawthorn, who faces Democrat Moe Davis in North Carolina’s 11th Congressional District, then reeled off a few historical figures who were young when they helped change America. ""George Washington was 21 when he received his first military commission. Abe Lincoln: 22 when he first ran for office. My personal favorite: James Madison was just 25 years old when he signed the Declaration of Independence,"" Cawthorn said. While Cawthorn’s claims about Washington and Lincoln merit minor corrections, there’s a big problem with his claim about Madison. Madison did turn 25 in 1776, the same year the Declaration of Independence was signed. But Madison didn’t sign it. You can see the list of signatories on the website for the National Archives. Born March 16, 1751, Madison was a young adult when he made significant contributions to the foundation of the United States. He participated in the framing of the Virginia Constitution in 1776. Before he became president in 1809, Madison in 1789 introduced a proposed Bill of Rights to the Constitution, according to the National Constitution Center. In an email to PolitiFact Wednesday night, Cawthorn’s spokesman said he meant to point out Madison’s age at the time the Declaration was signed. ""During the taping Madison Cawthorn wanted to mention James Madison,"" campaign spokesman John Hart said. ""He meant to say James Madison was 25 when the Declaration was written. His point stands that young people have made an enormous impact in this country, and still can."" Thursday morning, Cawthorn tweeted about the mistake. Let’s briefly review Cawthorn’s claims about the other presidents. Washington: Washington was sworn-in as a major of a militia when he was 21 and volunteered for active duty some ten months later, according to the U.S. Army’s website. A possible cause of confusion: Britain adopted a new calendar during Washington’s lifetime.  The National Archives record shows Washington was born in Virginia on February 11, 1731, according to the then-used Julian calendar. However, Britain and its colonies adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752 — moving Washington's birthday a year and 11 days to February 22, 1732. Lincoln: Abraham Lincoln was born on Feb. 12, 1809. He was 23 when he first ran for office in 1832, according to the Library of Congress. He finished eighth in a field of 13 candidates seeking a seat in the Illinois General Assembly, the NPS says. He was elected two years later. In a speech urging viewers to know American history, Cawthorn’s inaccurate claim about Madison stands out.

Pence in RNC speech praises Trump’s COVID-19 ‘seamless’ response, leaves out his state feuds
","Vice President Mike Pence portrayed his boss President Donald Trump as a leader who reached out across the aisle to help during the pandemic. ""President Trump marshalled the full resources of the federal government and directed us to forge a seamless partnership with governors across America in both parties,"" Pence said during his Aug. 26 Republican National Convention speech. Clearly the federal government has provided supplies and funding to states led by both parties in response to the pandemic, and Pence himself has held regular conference calls with governors in both parties. But Pence was speaking about the actions of Trump, not his own.  Pence’s comments ignore Trump’s multiple feuds, many times with Democratic governors, about state-federal responsibilities and pandemic response.  A Trump campaign spokesperson sent us a list of dozens of tele-conferences and meetings that Trump or Pence had with governors including Democrats such as New York’s Andrew Cuomo, and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer. In March, Trump sent a letter to governors thanking them for ""stepping up to help America confront this unprecedented global pandemic."" The campaign pointed to actions by administration officials to brief governors about making available supplies, such as testing swabs, utilizing the National Guard, and reopening their state’s economies.  Early in the pandemic, Trump traded barbs with governors, especially over where responsibility lay in securing medical supplies for the states.  After declaring a national emergency over the health crisis on March 13, Trump directed governors to order their own ventilators, respirators and supplies, saying the federal government is ""not a shipping clerk."" Governors in both parties shot back that Trump’s stance, and the lack of coordination from Washington, left states bidding against one another and the federal government for access to critical equipment. Cuomo said it was akin to competing on eBay with 50 other states and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Whitmer and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican and then chair of the National Governors Association, were among those pleading for better coordination from FEMA to ensure that supplies were distributed based on need.  ""The lack of any centralized coordination is creating a counterproductive competition between states and the federal government to secure limited supplies, driving up prices and exacerbating existing shortages,"" they wrote in a joint March 30 op-ed in the Washington Post. A couple days earlier, Trump said during a White House briefing that governors should be ""appreciative"" toward him and the federal government. Speaking of Pence, Trump said: ""He calls all the governors. I tell him — I mean, I’m a different type of person — I say, ‘Mike, don’t call the governor of Washington. You’re wasting your time with him. Don’t call the woman in Michigan.’"" On Twitter, Trump said Whitmer was ""way in over her head, she doesn’t have a clue."" In April, Trump said that testing ""is a local thing"" and that states should turn to commercial labs for help. After he was blasted by governors from both parties, Trump said the federal government would step up efforts to get testing supplies. Governors also called on Trump early on to enact the Defense Production Act, a law that gives the president authority to expedite the supply of materials for national defense, in order to ramp up production of personal protective equipment and COVID-19 testing supplies. While the president did eventually invoke the act to produce ventilators and medical equipment, he delayed efforts to do so and did it sparingly. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson called for him to broaden its use.  Trump’s justification for slow-rolling the act was that he didn’t want the government to intervene in the private sector.  ""You know, we’re a country not based on nationalizing our business,"" Trump said at a coronavirus task force press briefing on March 22. ""Call a person over in Venezuela, ask them how did nationalization of their businesses work out? Not too well."" In April, Trump said that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, had reopened Georgia ""too soon."" In May, he criticized Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, for keeping parts of his state closed that Trump said were ""barely affected.""  Trump said in mid April that it was up to him — not the governors — about when to re-open states on lockdown. Frustrated with the responses from the Trump administration, some governors teamed up with each other to get needed supplies. In May, a coalition of governors from seven Northeastern states, including New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Delaware, teamed up to buy personal protective equipment and ventilators and to create a re-unified reopening strategy.  As late as July, some governors were calling on the feds for help and not getting what they needed. There were shortages of testing supplies, as well as personal protective gear. Washington state asked for 4.2 million N-95 respirators. It got a bit under 500,000. It asked for about 300,000 gowns. It got about 160,000. On Aug. 18, a bipartisan group of governors — five Democrats and five Republicans — announced they would be teaming up with the Rockefeller Foundation to create a national testing strategy in the absence of federal action. The 10 states are Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Utah, Arkansas, Rhode Island and Virginia. Their goal is to buy and deploy 5 million COVID-19 antigen tests.  The Trump administration sought to pressure states to reopen in-person schools. In July, Trump threatened to cut off funding if schools didn’t reopen. This summer, the Trump administration reduced the federal share of National Guard assistance to the states to help with pandemic response, despite pleas from governors in both parties. An Aug. 3 memo said that the federal government would no longer continue to pay for 100% of the tab for most states and that it would be reduced to 75% as of Aug. 21. And when the CDC unveiled new testing guidelines that downplayed the need to test people who don’t show symptoms — about 40% of those infected — Cuomo and California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that they won’t follow it. Asymptomatic people are thought to be significant spreaders of the virus.  Both governors at times praised certain responses by the Trump administration to help their states respond to the pandemic. Pence said, ""President Trump marshalled the full resources of our federal government from the outset. He directed us to forge a seamless partnership with governors across America in both political parties."" Trump and top administration officials have communicated with governors of both parties for months in meetings, phone calls and written communication. But Pence’s comment ignores that Trump has feuded with governors over state-federal responsibilities, supplies and shutdown or reopen policies. He’s also suggested a lesser role for the federal government, and said that the handling of COVID-19 should be left to the states.  We rate this claim Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CE9440>],/factchecks/2020/aug/27/mike-pence/pence-rnc-speech-praises-trumps-covid-19-seamless-/

Overdose deaths declined in 2018. But there’s more to the story
","Detective Ryan Holets, whose personal story includes the adoption of an infant born to a drug-addicted mother, addressed the Republican National Convention on its second night. He praised President Donald Trump’s efforts in addressing drug and opioid abuse and noted ""drug overdose deaths decreased in 2018 for the first time in 30 years."" The detective has worked for the Albuquerque, New Mexico, police department for nine years and was invited by Trump to the 2018 State of the Union address. The year before, Holets promised an addicted mom that he and his wife would adopt her baby — and they did. Holets has seen the results of the nation’s drug crisis both professionally and personally. We reached out to the Albuquerque Police Department for the source of Holets’ data but did not get a response. The nation’s opioid crisis has been a talking point in Trump’s campaign since 2016 — and his administration has touted efforts it has made to provide money to states for treatment and other programs, so we decided to look into it. Did the death rate decline in 2018 as Holets noted? Yes, but that’s not the whole story. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 67,367 people died of a drug overdose in 2018. That number exceeded the tally, based on the most recent data available, of those who died either in car wrecks or by firearms. Two-thirds of those drug overdose deaths involved some type of opioid, including those given by prescription or those purchased illicitly, such as heroin. The CDC cites a rise in opioid deaths as coming in three ""waves."" The origin of the first wave came after doctors began prescribing more opioids for pain relief in the 1990s, with data showing a rise in deaths emerging around 1999, the CDC said. Another wave began in 2010. This one was fueled by deaths involving the illegal use of heroin. The third wave quickly followed, starting in 2013, with increases in deaths associated with synthetic opioids, particularly illicitly manufactured fentanyl. Despite the rising number of deaths, opioid prescribing continued to rise, fueled by marketing campaigns aimed at physicians by drug manufacturers. The total number of opioid prescriptions peaked in 2012 at more than 81 prescriptions per every 100 people in the U.S., according to CDC data. To combat that, a growing number of prescribing recommendations have been issued by physician and hospital groups, aimed at reducing the number of pills per prescription and the total number of prescriptions. The overall prescribing rate fell to 51 prescriptions per 100 people by 2018, according to the CDC. Still, Americans are more likely to fill a prescription painkiller than patients in other countries, and the rate of opioid prescriptions in the U.S. remains among the highest in the world. Deaths associated with all types of opioid use — from prescriptions to street use — are a lagging indicator of the number of people dependent or addicted to the drugs, said experts. Improved access to treatments to help people quit, as well as increased use of overdose reversal treatments, such as naloxone, can suppress death rates. The Trump administration has continued and expanded funding efforts, some of which began under President Barack Obama, to help provide treatment, research and other services. Yet the administration is also actively seeking to end the Affordable Care Act, which includes a provision requiring insurers to offer substance abuse treatment and has expanded access to treatment through Medicaid in the majority of states that fully implemented the law. Drug overdose deaths did decrease from 2017 to 2018, dropping by about 4.1%, according to the CDC. Still, the agency notes that the crisis is far from over, as the number of overdose deaths was four times higher in 2018 than in 1999. Parsing those numbers further, the decrease in deaths in 2018 came in three categories, with prescription-involved opioid deaths falling the most, a 13.5% decrease, followed by heroin deaths, down 4%. Conversely, deaths associated with the use of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, rose by 10%. So Holets was correct to say drug overdose deaths fell in 2018. But that statistic doesn’t put the issue in perspective. ""It did decrease slightly, meaning it went from 134 deaths a day to 130 deaths a day,"" noted Dr. Chad Brummett, a director of the Michigan Opioid Prescribing Engagement Network, a collaboration of physicians that makes recommendations on prescribing. ""It’s disingenuous to pretend that was a huge win,"" said Amy Bohnert, associate professor at the University of Michigan. ""As someone who does research on this, I would be reluctant to consider a change of that scale to be clearly a sign of a real change as opposed to random error."" Brandeis University professor Andrew Kolodny said it was the first overall downtick in drug overdoses in 30 years, but he would parse it a bit for opioids, saying it was the first decline in 25 years. However, a bigger issue for Kolodny is that the speaker failed to mention that drug overdose numbers went up again last year. ""It is misleading to point to a slight reduction in 2018, when deaths went up again in 2019 and we remain at record-high levels of opioid deaths,"" said Kolodny, medical director for the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management. The CDC says preliminary data shows reported overdose deaths went up 6% in the 12 months ending in January 2020. Holets is correct in saying that overall drug overdose deaths ticked down in 2018, although a small category of deaths — those related to fentanyl — rose. And it’s pretty close to 30 years since a decline was documented. Still, Holets failed to mention that drug overdose deaths went up again last year, according to preliminary data from the CDC. Also left unsaid were other factors that may contribute to the rising or falling drug death rates — and what that may say about the underlying level of dependence or addiction. We rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978034C0>],/factchecks/2020/aug/27/ryan-holets/drug-overdose-deaths-declined-2018-theres-more-sto/

Bloggers claim Reps. Marcia Fudge, Marcy Kaptur and Dennis Kucinich are 'card carrying' Socialists
","
Politicians need thick skin. Name calling has a long, if not honorable, history in public life, and opinions are protected speech under the Constitution.

But all names are not equal -- nor are they even matters of opinion.

A number of websites and blogs recently have been busy claiming there are 70 card-carrying Socialists in the U.S. House of Representatives, including three Democrats from Ohio: Reps. Marcia Fudge, Marcy Kaptur and Dennis Kucinich. (The number actually varies. Some posts say 70, others insist it’s either 73 or 76 and some go as high as 83. One post used both 76 and 75 in the same entry.)

While most of the names politicians are called are opinions, calling a congressman a Socialist sounds both emphatic and exact, which always gets our attention at PolitiFact Ohio.

Another thing that gets our attention is when a claim gets spread far and wide. This one meets that test, too.

Our colleagues at PolitiFact Oregon scrutinized the claim because it also named two members of that state's congressional delegation. We're following their work here.

An Aug. 12 post on the website for a group called Sovereign Citizens United mentions Fudge, Kaptur and Kucinich by name. It also says this: ""I’m sure if you asked random people on the street if we had open socialists in the U.S. Congress, they would say – well only Bernie Sanders (Senate). But the right answer is much, much worse.""

""This should come as a surprise to absolutely no one,""  says an Aug. 16 post on ConservativeByte.com. ""The radical Marxist-progressives (communists) took control of the Democrat party some time ago. They’ve only become more emboldened with the election of Barack Obama, who was raised as a communist from birth.""  

In case you miss the point, the post comes equipped with a large and very bright hammer and sickle emblem.

Here’s a blog post on Aug. 17 by Texas radio host Dan Cofall, whose show airs out of Fort Worth:

""The magic number ‘70’ is the number of members of the 111th Congress who are members of the Democratic Socialists of America.  These are not just politicians who vote left of center; these are card-carrying members of ‘the Democratic Socialists of America’.""

Cofall did not respond to an email asking for comment. And PolitiFact couldn’t reach anyone from ConservativeByte.

Before our ruling, let’s begin with some basics. Congress resets itself every two years, which means the current edition is the 112th Congress, not the 111th. Why does that matter?   Because the new Congress that begins in January every two years always follows an election and some of the people on the list are no longer in office.

Cofall acknowledges this but then continues to list names from the 111th Congress anyway. Those listed as ""card carrying"" socialists who are no longer serving include Robert Wexler (Florida), Phil Hare (Illinois), John Hall (New York), Alan Grayson (Florida), and Neil Abercrombie (Hawaii).

Then there’s this: Real card-carrying Socialists say those members are not Socialists.

The list that Cofall and dozens more rely upon ""is completely fraudulent,"" said Frank Llewellyn, who served as national director of the Democratic Socialists of America for 10 years until stepping down July 5.

There is not one member of Congress who is a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. In order to join, a person must fill out a form and pay dues. Even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is not a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said.

The last member of Congress who was an actual card-carrying member, he said, was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998.

Llewellyn and DSA’s new national director, Maria Svart are chagrined for two reasons. First, they have to spend time knocking down reports that never seem to go away.

Second, Llewellyn said, ""if we had formal political relationships with 70-odd members, we would be making a lot more money’’ from dues.

For the record, Fudge, Kaptur and Kucinich say they’ve never been associated with the Democratic Socialists of America.

Fudge's spokeswoman, Belinda Prinz, said the same claim came up last year, when the congresswoman's office contacted one website and asked that her name be removed from its list.

""We're sorry to see this erroneous information get repeated,"" Prinz said. ""She has never been a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and never endorsed their activities or policies.""

Kaptur denied the accusation and said, ""As a Polish-American, I know very well the difference between totalitarian communism and fascism on the one hand and social-democratic governments in Europe that include our NATO allies.""

Her spokesman, Steve Fought, said the claim ""is part of this unfortunate trend in our country where if you don't agree with someone politically, you vilify and villainize them.

""A lot of people who throw the word socialism around don't even know what it is and couldn't distinguish the different varieties,"" he said. ""It's a facile way for people who don't understand shades of gray to talk about political movements.""

Kucinich said: ""I'm a Democrat.""

Bad information gets spread all the time. But where did the number, or numbers, come from?

The list purported to have originated with the DSA says this on page two:

Q: How many members of the U.S. Congress are also members of the DSA?

A: Seventy

It then lists them by name. What it does not say is that the names are simply lifted en masse from the membership of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a collection of liberal-leaning lawmakers that includes not a single socialist.

According to its website, the Progressive Caucus is one of the largest in Congress and works for such causes as economic justice, civil rights and civil liberties as well as global peace and security. Llewellyn said that DSA supports some of the policy positions of the caucus.

Voicing support for positions embraced by a group of lawmakers is a routine part of business on Capitol Hill and is employed by organizations as disparate as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association and NORML, a group devoted to legalizing the use of marijuana. But agreeing with some positions doesn’t make a member of Congress a card-carrying Socialist.

Llewellyn says similar accusations of Socialism (with a capital S) have surfaced every election year since 1991 when the Progressive Caucus was created.

""There’s nothing we can do to stop it, Llewellyn said. ""I can’t tell you the number of times we’ve tried to stop it.""

Misinformation and smear campaigns also are part of political life. But these persistent claims about socialists are riddled with errors and outright lies. Any one of the problems would be sufficient to discredit the report, but taken together, the effort is flagrantly false. For that reason, we rate this claim: Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CE90C0>],/factchecks/2011/sep/06/blog-posting/bloggers-claim-reps-marcia-fudge-marcy-kaptur-and-/

Rick Perry says he switched to GOP at a younger age than Reagan did
","
On his Aug. 30 radio program, conservative commentator Sean Hannity noted that Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s years-ago switch from the Democratic to the Republican party Puts him in the same company as the nation’s 40th president. 
""You’re sort of like Ronald Reagan, you feel the Democratic Party left you?"" Hannity asked. 
Perry replied that he’d had a conversation with Reagan’s son Michael, a political consultant and former radio host. ""I told Michael Reagan the other day … ‘You know, I love your dad, and he was part of the reason I became a Republican,’ but I said, ‘I became a Republican sooner in my life than your dad did.’ "" 
Perry and Hannity shared a laugh over that. But that light moment left unresolved how old each leader was when he made his D-to-R leap. Did Perry beat Reagan to the flip point? 
We’ll take a look at Reagan first. In March 2010, PolitiFact Florida rated True the claim that ""Reagan was a Democrat before he was a Republican."" 
Historian Edward Yager, author of the 2006 biography Ronald Reagan’s Journey: Democrat to Republican, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan, who was born Feb. 6, 1911, ""was registered Democrat from the time that he voted for (Democrat Franklin Roosevelt) in 1932, when he was 21."" 
Yager said that he hadn’t seen copies of Reagan’s voter registration cards but that ""virtually all the sources that refer to"" Reagan’s party affiliation indicate that he was registered as a Democrat. Yager also noted that Reagan ""has two autobiographies in which he refers to his voting for (Roosevelt) four times"" and then for President Harry Truman, a Democrat, in 1948. 
Later, while still a Democrat, Reagan began supporting Republican presidential candidates. Melissa Giller, director of communications and programs at Reagan’s presidential library, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan endorsed the presidential candidacies of Republican Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 — at ages 41 and 45, respectively — and Republican Richard Nixon in 1960 ""while remaining a Democrat."" 
Perry and other Republican presidential candidates are scheduled to debate at the Reagan library, in Simi Valley, Calif., on Sept. 7. 
The library’s website says Reagan registered as a Republican in the fall of 1962, when he was 51. According to the site, a woman interrupted Reagan while he was speaking in favor of Nixon’s unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in California to ask him whether he had yet to register as a Republican. ""When he said, ‘Well, no, I haven’t yet, but I intend to,’ down the center aisle through the audience came a woman who declared, ‘I’m a registrar,’ and placed a registration card in front of him,"" the site says. ""In front of his audience, Ronald Reagan officially joined the Republican Party."" 
In her 2010 email to PolitiFact Florida, Giller pointed to the famous Reagan quip that Hannity echoed on his show: ""I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me.'' 
Other studies of Reagan also trace his party switch to 1962, including Yager’s book and a 1982 Reagan biography by Lou Cannon, which says Reagan ""was an active Democrat"" in 1952, when he married Nancy Davis, ""and would remain a registered Democrat for another decade."" 
In 1962, Cannon writes, when Reagan was approached by California Republicans to help campaign on their behalf, he told them that he ""didn’t want to be a professional Democrat campaigning for the Republicans"" and would re-register as a Republican. ""He did so, at a subsequent political meeting where he spoke on behalf of the ill-fated Nixon campaign against Governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown,"" Cannon writes. 
So, by several accounts, Reagan was 51 when he became a Republican, although he began backing GOP presidential candidates a decade earlier. 
How old was Perry, born March 4, 1950, when he made his move? 
We’ve looked at Perry’s political past in previous fact-checks, reporting that Perry won his first election as a Democrat, taking a West Texas House district seat in 1984, when Democrats controlled the Legislature and the state had had just one Republican governor since Reconstruction. He won re-election in 1986 and 1988 before switching parties in 1989 to challenge Democratic Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower in 1990 — a race that Perry won in an upset. 
The biography on Perry’s presidential campaign website agrees with that account. 
A July 14 Texas Tribune story says that during his years in the Texas House, Perry was far from liberal. ""Perry, a young rancher and cotton farmer, gained an early reputation as a fiscal conservative,"" the story says. ""He was one of a handful of freshman ‘pit bulls,’ so named because they sat in the lower pit of the House Appropriations Committee, where they fought to keep spending low."" 
The Tribune story says Perry announced he was changing parties on Sept. 29, 1989, during a press conference outside the Texas Capitol. ""I intend to vote the same convictions,"" Perry said then, according to the Tribune. ""The only difference is there will be an ‘R’ beside my name."" 
On the day of the press conference, Perry was 39 years old. 
We rate his statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097824740>],/factchecks/2011/sep/06/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-he-switched-gop-younger-age-reagan/

Bloggers say two Texas Democrats among Socialists in U.S. House
","
Texas Democratic U.S. Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston and Eddie Bernice Johnson of Dallas are both African-American members representing urban districts — and they’re among Socialists in Congress, blog posts say.

The posts, which drew the attention of our colleagues at PolitiFact Oregon, piggyback from a single offering replicated on dozens of websites in recent weeks. It says there are 70 card-carrying Socialists in the House of Representatives, including Johnson and Lee. (The number varies. Some posts say 70, while others insist it’s 73 or 76 or more.)
   
An Aug. 12, 2011, post on the website for a group called Sovereign Citizens United lists Johnson and Lee by name, along with others, saying too that it reflects 83 members of the ""Progressive Caucus."" It also says: ""I’m sure if you asked random people on the street if we had open (S)ocialists in the U.S. Congress, they would say — well only Bernie Sanders (Senate). But the right answer is much, much worse.""
   
""This should come as a surprise to absolutely no one,""  says an Aug. 16 post on ConservativeByte.com. ""The radical Marxist-progressives ([C]ommunists) took control of the Democrat party some time ago."" In case anyone misses the point, the post comes equipped with a large and very bright hammer-and-sickle emblem.
   
Most names that politicians are called are opinions, beyond fact-checking, but our judgment is that calling a congressman a Socialist, as in a card-carrying member, can be fairly gauged.
   
From a blog post on Aug. 17 by Texas radio host Dan Cofall, whose show airs out of Fort Worth: ""The magic number ‘70’ is the number of members of the 111th Congress who are members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). These are not just politicians who vote left of center; these are card-carrying members of ‘The Democratic Socialists of America.’ ""
   
Cofall did not respond to an email asking for comment. And PolitiFact Oregon couldn’t reach anyone from ConservativeByte.
   
Some background: Congress resets itself every two years, which means the current edition is the 112th Congress, not the 111th. Why does that matter? Because the Congress that begins in January every two years always follows an election. In this instance, some of the people on the list are no longer in office.
   
In his post, Cofall acknowledges this but then continues to list names from the 111th Congress anyway. Those listed as ""card carrying"" Socialists who are no longer serving include Robert Wexler (Florida), Phil Hare (Illinois), John Hall (New York), Alan Grayson (Florida) and Neil Abercrombie (Hawaii).

His blog links to a list purported to have originated with the DSA, which says this:
   
Q: How many members of the U.S. Congress are also members of the DSA?
   
A: Seventy.
   
It then lists them by name. A footnote credits the names to the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a collection of liberal-leaning lawmakers.

A spokeswoman for Johnson, Dena Craig, declined to comment on the characterization, instead urging us to contact the caucus. ""We stand behind the caucus,"" Craig said. We didn’t hear back from Lee.

The Progressive Caucus, founded in 1991, says its members include a senator and 75 House Democrats, including Lee and Johnson. Its core principles are economic justice and security for all; civil rights and civil liberties; global peace and security; and environmental protection and energy independence.

In an interview, Brad Bauman, its executive director, called ""categorically false"" blog posts indicating caucus members are Socialists. ""It’s basically a slander against the caucus,"" he said.

Then there’s this: Real card-carrying Socialists say the listed House members aren’t Socialists. The list that Cofall and dozens more rely on ""is completely fraudulent,"" said Frank Llewellyn, who served as national director of the Democratic Socialists of America for 10 years until stepping down in July.
   
DSA supports some caucus policy positions, Llewellyn said, but no House members are DSA members. To join, a person must fill out a form and pay dues. Even Sanders, the Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist, is not a member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. The last member of Congress who was a card-carrying member, he said, was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998.
   
Llewellyn aired chagrin for two reasons. First, the group has to spend time knocking down reports that never seem to go away. Second, Llewellyn said, ""if we had formal political relationships with 70-odd members, we would be making a lot more money’’ from dues.
       
Llewellyn said similar accusations of Socialism (with a capital S) have surfaced every election year since the caucus was created. ""There’s nothing we can do to stop it,"" Llewellyn said. ""I can’t tell you the number of times we’ve tried to stop it.""

The repeated claim about Lee, Johnson and other House members being Socialists shakes out as flagrantly incorrect. Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2C1340>],/factchecks/2011/sep/05/blog-posting/bloggers-say-two-texas-democrats-among-socialists-/

Barack Obama says U.S. never lost a major battle in Vietnam
","
During a speech before the 93rd annual conference of the American Legion on Aug. 30, 2011, President Barack Obama praised the Vietnam War veterans in the audience for their service and achievements.

""You, our Vietnam veterans, did not always receive the respect that you deserved — which was a national shame,"" Obama said. ""But let it be remembered that you won every major battle of that war. Every single one.""

When we noticed Obama’s claim, we were skeptical. Was it really true that the United States, even as it lost the Vietnam War, actually won every major military battle?

We checked with a variety of historians specializing in the period, and 10 of them responded to our inquiries. Combined, their responses provoked a lively and nuanced debate, which we’ll recap here.

Here are some issues to consider:

• What constitutes ""winning""? It’s not as easy to answer this question as one might think.

Lance Janda, a professor of history at Cameron University in Lawton, Okla., said that ""our strategy in Vietnam did not revolve around taking and holding terrain. In fact, we often captured and then abandoned key positions over and over again, and measured our progress in the war through a body count.""

By that measure, Janda added, ""it’s certainly true that we consistently inflicted far greater casualties on the Viet Cong and North Vietnam than we suffered, and if that’s the only gauge one uses to measure ‘victory,’ then we really did win in Vietnam.""

On the other hand, he said, ""if you argue that the North Vietnamese learned how to fight us in the early major battles of the war and then developed superior tactical and strategic plans for prolonging and ultimately winning the war, then you can plausibly make the case that they were winning a lot of battles from the beginning, regardless of the body count.""

• What constitutes a ""major"" battle? There is no official list of ""major"" battles of the Vietnam War. Some battles could plausibly be classified as either major or minor, or else be classified as one battle within a broader campaign.

Some observers have suggested that the U.S. actually lost more than two dozen battles during Vietnam. But the 10 historians we contacted agreed that most, and possibly all, of the major battles were won by the U.S.

The biggest battles, including Tet and Khe Sanh, ""took place in the first half of 1968 and all were clearly American victories,"" said Edwin E. Moise, a Clemson University historian. But if you expand the universe of battles that qualify as ""major,"" two in particular might be considered U.S. defeats, he said.

One likely loss was the battle at Landing Zone Albany, in November 1965. An American battalion of about 400 men was ambushed by the People’s Army of North Vietnam -- the North Vietnamese army -- and parts of the battalion were overrun, Moise said. The preliminary count of American casualties was 151 killed, 121 wounded and 5 missing.

Since defensive perimeters were established and a majority of U.S. troops did survive the battle, some might not consider it a defeat, but Moise is among those who do. Maj. Steven M. Leonard wrote in the journal Army Logistician that ""inevitably, there were those who would draw comparison to"" the wipeout of Gen. George A. Custer’s 7th Cavalry at the Little Big Horn.

The second likely loss was the battle of Fire Support Base Ripcord in mid 1970, which was largely unknown by the public into the mid 1980s.

The United States established Ripcord to help launch attacks in the A Shau and Da Krong valleys, Moise said, but the North Vietnamese army attacked it ""so strongly that the American command decided it had better get the U.S. troops out fast if it was to get them out alive. The withdrawal on July 23 was so hasty that the withdrawing troops were not able to take along all their artillery pieces. I would have to call this an American defeat.""

Richard H. Kohn, a historian at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill), added that the South Vietnamese Army lost battles even with the benefit of U.S. advisers and air power, such as Operation Lam Son 719, the incursion into Laos in 1971 that led to heavy casualties.

• Is winning military battles the appropriate yardstick to judge the Vietnam War? Ultimately, this is the question that matters. If you assume that the U.S. really did win all the major battles of the war on military terms, how does one square that with the reality that the U.S. lost the war as a whole?

""For the most part, Vietnam was not a war of ‘major battles,'"" said Andrew Bacevich, a career Army officer who now teaches international relations at Boston University.  ""What matters is a war's outcome. Therefore, the president's claim is largely beside the point -- not unlike advocates of the 'Lost Cause' citing Robert E. Lee's victories as evidence of the superiority of the Confederate army.""

To better analyze this paradox, let’s look at a couple of examples of military victories that were losses in the bigger picture.

One example is the Tet Offensive, which is often considered the turning point of the war.

In January 1968, the North Vietnamese army launched a surprise attack during Tet, the Vietnamese New Year. Militarily, it was a major defeat for the Communists, but in the public relations sphere, it was far from a victory for the United States. The offensive, Moise has written, undercut U.S. claims that the Communists were weak, brought the brutality of the war to American television screens, and led to the highest U.S. casualty rates of the war.

""It was a tactical victory for the U.S. in the sense of casualties inflicted and a strategic victory in the military sense, because it defeated the enemy's plan in the field,"" said James C. Bradford, a Texas A&M University historian. ""But the North Vietnamese won a strategic political victory in the sense that the campaign eroded support for the war in the U.S. and contributed directly to President Lyndon B. Johnson's decision to not seek re-election.""

Meanwhile, in the battle for ""Hamburger Hill"" in May 1969, 46 Americans died and 400 were wounded. Enemy losses were much higher -- the number of dead was estimated to be 673 -- and the U.S. seized the hill in question. So by body counts and tactical achievements, the battle for Hamburger Hill was a U.S. victory. But within days, the U.S. decided to abandon the position it had seized, for tactical and operational reasons. And the victory came at a steep price back home.

As the late Col. Harry G. Summers Jr. wrote in 1999, ""war is first and foremost a political act, and in the view of politicians in Washington the 101st Airborne Division's assault on Hamburger Hill had been a disaster. As Hedrick Smith reported in the May 23, 1969, New York Times, a number of civilian officials in the Nixon administration were afraid such Pyrrhic victories would undermine public support for the war and thus shorten the administration's time for successful negotiations in Paris.""

The historians we contacted largely agreed that the president was technically right, or at least close to right, in saying that the U.S. won the war’s major battles.

Author Doris Kearns Goodwin noted that Obama’s comments were targeted directly to veterans. ""The responsibility for the eroding support for the war falls on the political leaders, not on the veterans,"" she said.

At the same time, while Obama's comment may be technically accurate, several historians added that it may be irrelevant because it does not address the larger factors that had a more dramatic impact on the conduct and outcome of the war.

Before his death in 1999, Summers liked to tell about a meeting he had with a North Vietnamese colonel named Tu while he was with a delegation visiting Hanoi in 1975. At one point, Summers told Tu, ""You know, you never defeated us on the battlefield."" Tu paused for a moment, then replied, ""That may be so. But it is also irrelevant.""

Obama’s claim, said Cameron University’s Janda, ""is ultimately emotional and defies logic.""

Our ruling

Most of the the 10 historians agreed that Obama was pretty close to correct when he said that the U.S. didn’t lose any major battles in the Vietnam War -- ""pretty close"" because a case can be made that the U.S. lost the battles for Landing Zone Albany and Fire Support Base Ripcord, and possibly others. 
But Obama's remark to the veterans fits our definition of a Half True - the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Although the U.S. may have won most of the major battles, it's important to note that there is wide agreement that the U.S. lost the war. The cause of that may very well be political decisions rather than military ones, but it's an exaggeration to portray the U.S. effort the way Obama has. We rate his statement Half True.

Point Pleasant Beach mayor says borough's beaches are privately owned
","
It might seem a given that a Shore town would rake in waves of revenue from its beaches.

But that’s not always the case. Point Pleasant Beach, for example, doesn’t own most of its beaches but is responsible for some of the costs associated with millions of visitors every summer, according to Mayor Vincent Barrella.

""Point Pleasant Beach does not own its beaches; they are privately owned and operated by businesses such as Jenkinson’s,"" Barrella wrote in an Aug. 22 column that appeared in The star-Ledger.

Could it be true that some of the most popular beachfront along the Jersey Shore is privately owned?

PolitiFact New Jersey found that more than 42 acres of beach are privately owned and operated in Point Pleasant Beach, and the borough owns only the 1.03-acre Maryland Avenue Beach.

Several other Shore towns also do not own their beaches, said Larry Hajna, spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.

Let’s look at beach ownership in the borough.

Point Pleasant Beach has approximately two miles of privately held oceanfront property, according to the borough’s 2006 Open Space and Recreation Plan. The public can access nearly 30 of those 42 acres by purchasing daily or seasonal badges from private operators. The remaining beach is not open to the public, according to the plan.

Most of the borough’s beaches are owned by Jenkinson’s, Martell’s, Risdens Beach Inc., the Elizabeth Carter Association and a number of private homeowners.

One of the largest beaches in the borough is owned by Jenkinson’s, but the company also has the costs that come along with it.

""We own it, operate it, insure it and staff it,"" said Marilou Halvorsen, marketing director for Jenkinson’s Boardwalk.

Although the Maryland Avenue Beach is owned by the borough, Aqua Serve Lifeguard Service leases and operates it. The difference in ownership means Aqua can charge whatever admission fee the market can bear, while municipal operation of the beach would mean the state sets the maximum fee, said Borough Clerk Maryann Ellsworth.

And that’s been a losing proposition for the community.

""We lost so much money running it that we decided at least six years ago to lease out the running of the beach,"" said Ellsworth, who added that the borough lost from $10,000 to $14,000 annually when it operated the beach.

Aqua Serve pays the borough $2,000 annually to operate Maryland Avenue beach, but that money is largely eaten up in costs the borough pays for portable toilets there, Ellsworth said. The daily badge fee at Maryland Avenue Beach is $8.

Beaches and the cost to operate them was even an issue for the town’s forefathers.

Minutes from the Aug. 16, 1887 meeting of the Point Pleasant Beach Council state ""Ownership of the beach turned down by the Council because of extreme cost to the borough for maintenance,"" according to the Point Pleasant Historical Society. At that point, the council decided to permit privately owned beaches in the borough.

Still, Barrella told PolitiFact New Jersey that he hopes the borough can one day buy Risdens Beach if it ever becomes available, so the borough can generate revenue the way he said Belmar and Manasquan do from their beaches.

Belmar’s beach badge revenue total was $3,023,386 from Memorial Day to Labor Day in 2010; and $2,657,278 from Memorial Day this year through Aug. 21, said Patricia Zwirz, purchasing agent.

Manasquan, which has a utility to operate its beach, took in $1,793,000 from beach badges in 2010 for the same period as Belmar; and was at $1,695,000 just before Hurricane Irene hit the Jersey Shore, according to Beach Department manager/beach manager Walter Wall.

Our ruling

Barrella says the borough’s beaches are privately owned and operated by various businesses in town. While Jenkinson’s and others do own most of the beachfront, the borough owns slightly more than an acre of prime real estate: the Maryland Avenue beach. For that reason, we rate Barrella’s claim Mostly True.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says a new tuition reciprocity deal with Minnesota makes college more affordable for Wisconsin residents
","
The start of September means the start of college classes in Wisconsin and Minnesota -- two states that for more than 45 years have used tuition reciprocity agreements to make it easier for students in each state to attend school across the border.

Reciprocity means a Wisconsin resident who attends a public university or technical college in Minnesota is treated as a Minnesota resident and can pay in-state tuition, rather than the higher out-of-state tuition rate. The same goes for Minnesota residents attending college in Wisconsin.

The difference is significant. At the University of Minnesota, for example, in-state tuition in 2011-2012 is $13,062 and out-of-state tuition is $5,000 more, figures from the Minnesota Office of Higher Education show.

When the annual renewal of the reciprocity agreement was announced on Aug. 15, 2011, an article on JSOnline.com, the website of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, carried this headline: ""Wisconsin students to pay more under new tuition pact with Minnesota.""

The additional cost would be about $1,400 more each year for Wisconsin residents attending the University of Minnesota and about $2,200 for those attending the University of Minnesota-Duluth, the article said. The amounts vary at other campuses.

But in a news release issued the same day, Gov. Scott Walker said:

""This new tuition reciprocity agreement with the State of Minnesota makes college education more affordable for Wisconsin residents. Smaller tuition bills widen access to higher education, and that’s a win-win situation for students and Wisconsin.""

Wait. More affordable even as you pay more?

Sounds like the new math.

Let’s hit the books.

Since 1965, Wisconsin has had a tuition reciprocity agreement with Minnesota in one form or another, according to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It’s the only reciprocity agreement that allows Wisconsin residents to attend public universities outside of Wisconsin and pay the lower in-state tuition rate.

Other reciprocity agreements relate to community and technical colleges in Michigan, Illinois and Iowa, according to the Wisconsin Higher Educational Aids Board.

Because tuition in Minnesota is generally higher, the reciprocity agreement was amended in 2007 so that Wisconsin would make supplementary payments to Minnesota schools, according to the state fiscal bureau.

Here’s an example of how the supplementary payment worked in the 2010-2011 school year:

Two schools considered comparable under the reciprocity agreement are the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Minnesota, where nearly half of the Wisconsin reciprocity students studying in Minnesota attend school.

In 2010-2011, tuition was $9,794 at the Twin Cities campus and $8,398 at UW-Madison, a difference of $1,396.

A Wisconsin resident attending the University of Minnesota had to pay only the $8,398; that meant the University of Minnesota was receiving $1,396 less than it received from a Minnesota resident. Through the supplementary payment, the State of Wisconsin paid the difference of $1,396 to the University of Minnesota.

Under the new reciprocity agreement, the supplementary payments to Minnesota schools are eliminated.

That means Wisconsin residents, starting with freshmen entering college in 2012-2013, will have to pay the full in-state tuition to attend school in Minnesota. Had the supplements been eliminated in 2010-2011, a Wisconsin resident attending the University of Minnesota would have had to pay $1,396 more in tuition.

The move is expected to save Wisconsin $2.6 million in 2012-2013 and more in subsequent years, according to the fiscal bureau.

In announcing the new reciprocity agreement, Walker said more than 10,000 Wisconsin students participate in the program every year. But his news release didn’t explain his quote about how the new deal makes college more affordable for Wisconsin residents, so we asked his spokesman, Cullen Werwie, for evidence.

Werwie didn’t have any. He simply pointed out that, if there were no reciprocity agreement, Wisconsin residents would have to pay the higher out-of-state tuition rate to attend school in Minnesota. But that goes without saying.

What’s more, the idea of tuition reciprocity is not new. An agreement has been in place since before Walker was born.

Let’s go to the Truth-O-Meter.

Walker said the new tuition reciprocity agreement between Wisconsin and Minnesota makes college ""more affordable for Wisconsin residents.""

But the new agreement doesn’t make attending school in Minnesota any more affordable. In fact, it’s just the opposite. By eliminating supplementary payments from the state, the typical reciprocity student from Wisconsin will have to pay $1,400 more in tuition each year, based on 2010-2011 figures.

Walker’s statement grades out as Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097060600>],/factchecks/2011/sep/04/scott-walker/wisconsin-governor-scott-walker-says-tuition-recip/

Robocall says Cranston mayoral academy would increase taxes 6 percent to 8 percent
","
Last month, many residents of Cranston received an anonymous recorded call with a message delivered by an authoritative-sounding male voice warning:

""Parents, teachers, students and taxpayers. On Wednesday, Aug. 24, at 5 p.m. in front of the Cranston City Hall there will be a rally to save Cranston's award-winning school district. Mayor Fung wants to punish our children's education by removing $12 million from current funding to pay for his private charter school. Your taxes would increase by between 6 and 8 percent per year. This will be your last chance to deny the mayor from making our district second class. Be there.""

Pulling $12 million out the Cranston school system sounded bad enough, but the prospect of a tax increase of 6 percent to 8 percent was even more frightening.

But we were skeptical because, in the first place, state law limits property tax increases (the limit is currently 4.25 percent) unless a city or town gets a special exception from the General Assembly.

So we decided to investigate.

THE BACKGROUND

Charter schools are financed by local tax dollars but are free from many of the requirements that apply to traditional public schools. Supporters say such flexibility allows charters to have longer days and longer school years, and to experiment with alternative teaching methods. The students are usually chosen by lotteries and most schools are not unionized.

Cranston Mayor Allan Fung had proposed a public charter school, known as a mayoral academy, for Cranston and Providence. A similar school is operating for residents of Cumberland, Lincoln, Central Falls and Pawtucket.

Under Fung’s proposal, the school would have been run by Achievement First, a nonprofit group that operates 19 similar charter schools in Connecticut and New York City. A board of directors headed by the mayor would have overseen the school.

The proposal was rejected by the Rhode Island Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education on Sept. 1, 2011, after intervention by Gov. Lincoln Chafee, who recommended an alternative: studying the possibility of creating an Achievement First mayoral academy in Providence, drawing students from that city, Cranston, and other communities.

In his letter, Chafee urged the regents to take the opposition in Cranston -- and there was a lot of it -- seriously.

Opponents say such schools are a threat to traditional public schools because they siphon away the most-promising students (those whose parents are involved enough to apply for the lottery) and drain the resources needed to make public schools better.

The robocall was reflecting that concern.

The calls were financed by Richard Tomlins, a Democrat who ran against Fung for mayor in 2010. He wrote the script for the calls.

We asked Tomlins why he referred to the academy as a ""private"" school when accountability would lie with the mayor, any Cranston child could apply for the lottery and parents wouldn't have to pay tuition.

Tomlins said it was because the nonprofit company that runs it, Achievement First, accepts corporate donations.

He said the $12-million figure came from multiplying the amount spent on teaching a child in Cranston (about $13,000 per pupil) by the number of pupils who would be leaving the system (950).

He said the robocall predicted an annual 6 percent to 8 percent tax increase because that's what it would take to raise the $12 million from property taxes.

THE ACTUAL NUMBERS

To check, we turned to an analysis by the Rhode Island Department of Education, which developed a list of the costs to Cranston of the proposed charter school.

First we looked whether the mayoral academy, if approved, would draw $12 million from ""current funding.""

The fact is, the project would not have removed a dime from the budget for the current fiscal year because the school would not have begun operations until a year from now.

So right off the bat, we were smelling lighter fluid.

Then, we examined whether the $12 million would be true for subsequent years.

According to the Rhode Island Department of Education, in the first year of operation, the school would have had 88 Cranston kindergartners, not 950 students as Tomlins had said. The state said the cost to the city that first year would have been $664,670, a price tag that would continue to grow as the school added more grades.

By the time those kindergartners had become fifth graders and the academy had evolved into a full-fledged elementary school in the fall of 2017, the annual loss to Cranston's school department was projected to be $6.2 million. At that point, it would have had 460 students, nearly half of what Tomlins said.

Thus, the amount of ""current funding"" being diverted to the academy this year, or six years from now, would not have come close to the $12 million mentioned in the robocall.

THE TAX QUESTION

How much would taxes go up if there had been a mayoral academy in Cranston?

For most PolitiFact items, we don't look at predictions. After all, things can change and predictions can only be fact-checked in retrospect.

But the debate over taxes offers some insight into one reason the academy was so controversial.

Fung’s proposal came at a time when Cranston is getting a big infusion of state education money -- the amount goes up by an extra $2.3 million per year every year through 2018 -- thanks to the state's new financing formula that benefits some communities over others.

The bad news for the School Department: It doesn't necessarily get to keep that money; it follows the student wherever that student goes.

Thus, if pupils get diverted to a mayoral academy that the School Department doesn't control, the department loses revenue.

Fung said that should not have mattered. The School Department may lose some financing, but it would also be losing students and the costs associated with teaching them. The cumulative projected cost of Cranston's share of the academy over six years was $20.3 million.  Extra aid from the state financing formula over the same period will be $63.4 million.

""The funding formula is a per-pupil allocation and schools have to live within that,"" said Fung, whose Aug. 9 financial analysis of the proposal asserted that any fears that the mayoral academy ""would necessitate new tax dollars, or may add an additional tax burden on Cranston residents are unfounded.""

But opponents of the academy said it's not so simple. Losing 4 percent of your students may immediately take away 4 percent of your revenue, but it doesn't automatically cut 4 percent of your costs.

Steven Bloom, the unofficial budget expert on the School Committee and the man Tomlins himself suggested we consult, said that if the academy had been approved, it would have plunged the School Department's budget into the red by $20 million after five years and necessitated an annual tax increase of 2 percent to 3 percent per year.

(One reason: The department is trying to pay the city back for the $6 million it overspent in the previous years. Bloom said that without the academy, the department should be in the black by the 2016-17 fiscal year, thanks in part to the extra state money.)

ROBOCALL DOES NOT COMPUTE

But we're checking the facts behind Tomlins' robocall, a call that may have galvanized some of the local opposition Chafee was talking about.

It is also a call that Bloom, an opponent of the mayoral academy, characterized as ""infuriating"" and misinformed.

So let's summarize.

Tomlins characterized the mayoral academy as Fung's ""private charter school,"" said it would have removed ""$12 million from current funding,"" and would have increased taxes ""between 6 and 8 percent per year.""

It would not have been Fung's private school -- he would not have been able to take it with him when he left office. It would not have been a private school at all.

It would not have drained any money from the current school budget.

It would not have drained $12 million from the city in any annual budget projected through 2018.

The projected cumulative cost over six years would have been $20.3 million at a time when the city would be getting a $63.4 million infusion in additional state aid.

Even if you bought Bloom's argument that the academy would ultimately have sent the School Department $20 million into the red, that still would have left Cranston with $23.1 million more in its coffers to help improve the city's public schools.

And to threaten that the mayoral academy would have increased taxes by 6 percent to 8 percent each year when state law makes it difficult to impose such big tax hikes is ridiculous.

There were legitimate reasons to support or oppose Cranston's mayoral academy, but this robocall didn't correctly cite any of them.

And because the false, inflammatory statements were made anonymously, we're going to do a little inflaming of our own. We rate Tomlin's ridiculous robocall Pants On Fire!

"['Israel', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Texas', 'Kinky Friedman']","
Kinky Friedman says Barack Obama's favorable rating in Israel once was 4 percent
","
Texas humorist Kinky Friedman, who challenged Rick Perry for governor five years ago, prefers Perry to Barack Obama for president.

Friedman, who is Jewish, offers among his reasons in an Aug. 24, 2011, column in The Daily Beast that Perry is a friend to Israel who has visited the country ""on many more occasions than Obama, who’s been there exactly zero times as president. If I were Obama I wouldn’t go either. His favorability rating in Israel once clocked in at 4 percent.""

It's been documented that Obama has not been to Israel as president. But Is Friedman’s 4 percent statement right?

An online search led us to reports of an August 2009 poll in Israel in which only 4 percent of respondents saw the Democratic president’s administration as more pro-Israel than pro-Palestinian. The Jerusalem Post, which commissioned the poll from the Smith Research Center, reported that 51 percent of the polled Israelis said Obama’s administration was more pro-Palestinian than pro-Israel, 35 percent considered it neutral and 10 percent declined to express an opinion.

Six times from May 2009 through May 2011, the polling firm asked Israelis about the Obama administration’s lean toward Israel and the Palestinians, with the August 2009 results marking the administration’s lowest pro-Israel rating, according to a summary chart posted by the newspaper this May. The administration’s highest pro-Israel rating came in May 2009; 31 percent of respondents said it was more pro-Israel, 14 percent said it was more pro-Palestinian. In the May 2011 poll, 12 percent said the administration was more pro-Israel, 40 percent rated it more pro-Palestinian.

Next, we asked academic experts and journalists versed in the Middle East about Obama’s standing in Israel.

Professors Michael Desch of the University of Notre Dame and Jennifer Loewenstein of the University of Wisconsin-Madison agreed that Obama’s policies toward achieving peace in the Middle East are not weaker toward Israel than those of previous presidents, though there have been perceptions otherwise at least since Obama reached out to the Muslim world in a June 2009 speech in Cairo.

Both also noted that The Jerusalem Post polls did not inquire directly into Obama’s popularity. Desch, a political scientist, added that Obama might not be as unpopular in Israel as The Post polls suggest. In a November 2009 poll gauging Obama’s popularity among Israelis, commissioned by the U.S.-based New America Foundation, 41 percent of 1,000 respondents had a favorable view of Obama while 37 percent had an unfavorable view, according to a Dec. 10, 2009, news article in Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper.

Not that participants had glowing hopes. Haaretz reported that 55 percent of those polled said they thought Obama did not support Israel, with 42 percent saying he did, reflecting the ""complexity of views"" about him as he pressed both Israel and the Palestinians to resume stalled peace talks, the paper said. The article quoted pollster Jim Gerstein saying: ""They genuinely admire and like him ... but at the same time they also want to feel that he is in their corner, and they have concerns over this.""

In the poll, 50 percent of respondents believed Obama was ""weak on terrorism,"" while 43 percent rated him as naïve, the newspaper said.

In its own analysis, the foundation said that while Obama’s favorability rating is ""not astronomically high for a U.S. president, it is notably stronger than the favorability ratings for Israel's foreign and defense ministers, and a mere seven (percentage) points below that of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.""

The foundation quoted Gil Tamary of Israel's Channel 10 News saying that much of Obama's relative unpopularity is a direct consequence of the Israeli press' daily attacks on him. ""But based on our survey results,"" the foundation said, ""should Obama decide to make a direct pitch to the Israeli public, his starting position would be one of relative strength. Obama has not yet reached out to Israelis in the way he has to the Muslim world, with his historic trips to Egypt and Turkey. A similarly momentous state visit to Israel could build a tremendous amount of goodwill with an already receptive Israeli public.""

We searched for other polls of Obama’s standing in Israel.

Gallup has not asked explicitly about the president, but it has polled Israelis on whether they approve or disapprove of the job performance of the leadership of the United States. In 2009, Obama’s first year as president, 61 percent approved. In 2010, 54 percent approved, 34 percent disapproved and 14 percent did not know or refused to answer, Gallup says.

This year, the Pew Research Center surveyed attitudes on issues including confidence in Obama in more than 20 countries, including Israel. ""About half (49 percent) of Israelis have at least some confidence in Obama,"" Pew said in its July summary, ""when it comes to world affairs and about the same percentage (51 percent) has little or no confidence in the U.S. president.""

The narrow divide in confidence in Obama contrasts with a chasm over his handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Only 29 percent of respondents in Israel approved of Obama’s handling of the conflict; 64 percent disapproved. Pew said 84 percent of residents of the Palestinian territories disapproved of Obama’s handling of the conflict. ""Elsewhere in the Middle East, at least eight-in-ten in Lebanon (85 percent), Jordan (82 percent) and Egypt (82 percent) disapprove of Obama’s handling of this issue,"" Pew said.

Uriel Heilman, managing editor of JTA, which describes itself as a global news service of the Jewish people, told us in an interview that many Israelis view Obama as hostile to the country’s current government in part because the American president was critical of Israeli settlements at a time the government was seen at home as making peace concessions. Another time, he said, there was umbrage at Netanyahu not getting a photo opportunity or press conference with Obama during a White House visit.

Heilman added: ""Let’s not forget Obama is a Democrat and Netanyahu is the equivalent of a Republican"" in Israel. Also, he said, Obama’s race may be a factor: ""Some people have biases.""

By email, Gil Hoffman, The Jerusalem Post’s chief political correspondent, suggested Obama has not owned up to missteps. He pointed to a July 2010 interview in which Obama was asked by Israeli anchorwoman Yonit Levy about people who feel he doesn’t have a special connection to Israel. Obama replied: ""Some of it may just be the fact that my middle name is Hussein, and that creates suspicion. Some of it may have to do with the fact that I have actively reached out to the Muslim community, and I think that sometimes, particularly in the Middle East, there’s the feeling of the friend of my enemy must be my enemy. And the truth of the matter is, is that my outreach to the Muslim community is designed precisely to reduce the antagonism and the dangers posed by a hostile Muslim world to Israel and to the West."" He noted, though, that every speech he’d given about Israel referred to the United States’ special bond with it, including support for its survival and people.

Hoffman opined that Obama’s unpopularity is rooted in the absence of peace talks and the failure of his policies to ""advance the peace process the way his Democratic and Republican predecessors did. The Israeli Right, which doesn't want a Palestinian state, wouldn't have liked him anyway. And the Israeli Left, which desperately wants two states for two peoples, is very disappointed. We had negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians for 16 years.They ended when Obama was elected and they have not re-started since.""

So, what of Friedman’s claim?

There was a 4-percent result in a poll, but that question covered the Obama administration’s support for Israel--not Obama’s popularity. Meantime, Obama has been viewed favorably by a greater share of Israelis. The statement misrepresents his standing. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C41C380>],/factchecks/2011/sep/04/kinky-friedman/kinky-friedman-says-barack-obamas-favorable-rating/
"['New Jersey', 'Education', 'New Jersey Education Association']","
NJEA claims New Jersey public school students have best Advanced Placement scores in nation
","
New Jersey’s largest teachers union believes the state’s public schools deserve recognition for a number of reasons. Among them: student performance on college-level exams.

""New Jersey's public school students have the best Advanced Placement scores in the nation,"" a page on the New Jersey Education Association’s website says, citing 2010 data.

With New Jersey students beginning another school year, PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check the union’s claim. On this statement, they get a perfect score.

Advanced Placement, or AP, exams are college-level tests scored on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest score. Three is considered a passing grade -- and is the minimum score most colleges require for a student to receive credit for the exam.

The New York-based College Board, which administers the AP tests, releases detailed charts breaking down student performance on AP exams in the 50 states and Washington, D.C. The most recent data available is from the 2009-2010 school year. Students’ scores from the most recent academic year won’t be released to the public until this fall, according to Kathleen Steinberg, a spokeswoman for the College Board.

Steinberg said the claim by the teachers union ""is, in fact, an accurate statement."" But, she said, the College Board doesn’t maintain rankings and doesn’t encourage anyone to rank states by performance because ""you’re not comparing the same population.""

Still, Steinberg said, ""Everyone loves to do that. States love to do it."" Especially, she said, if they do well.

And New Jersey did do well.

According to PolitiFact New Jersey’s analysis of the data, the average AP test score of 3.34 for public school students in the Garden State outranked students in the rest of the country.  In New Jersey, 39,895 public school students took at least one AP exam in  2010.

The average score includes all exams taking during a school year. So, if one student took five exams, the scores from each of those five exams are included in the overall average.

New Jersey and Connecticut are tied for the highest average AP test score in the country for all students -- including both public and private school students -- at 3.32. For New Jersey, that number includes 48,836 students who took at least one AP exam. For Connecticut, it includes 25,646 students.

New Jersey, Iowa, Montana, North Dakota, Utah and Vermont are the only states where the average AP test score is higher for students who attended public school than the average score of all students in the state.

As far as why New Jersey is doing well on the test, Gregg Fleisher, national AP training and incentives program director for the Texas-based National Math and Science Initiative, said, ""obviously: good schools, good teachers and good communities.""

But, Fleisher argued that average test score isn’t the most important metric because ""it rewards exclusivity.""  

If more students took the AP test in New Jersey,  he said the state’s ""mean scores and percent passing would likely go way down.""

Steve Baker, a spokesman for the NJEA, said the fact that New Jersey public school students are scoring well on college-level exams ""shows that New Jersey public schools are doing an exceptionally good job."" But, Baker noted, the average AP test score is just one of a ""broad array of indicators"" the teachers union looks at to evaluate performance of public schools.  

Our ruling

The NJEA claims the state’s public school students have the best Advanced Placement test scores in the country.

PolitiFact New Jersey compared the average AP test scores for students across the nation and found New Jersey’s public school students rank first.

A spokeswoman for the College Board said her organization doesn’t compile rankings -- and doesn’t encourage others to do so -- but confirmed the union's statement was accurate.

We rate this statement True.

"['National', 'New Hampshire 2012', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says 500,000 federal workers earn more than $100,000 a year
","
To bolster their case to reduce the size and cost of government, Republicans often say federal employees are overpaid. During an Aug. 15, 2011, town hall in Litchfield, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney cited salary figures to make the point.

""I found it surprising that over a quarter of federal workers make more than $100,000 a year -- 500,000 federal workers make more than $100,000 a year.'' Romney said.

To back up the claim, the Romney campaign cited figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that say the total federal civilian work force is 2.2 million federal employees, not including postal workers. The campaign also cited a USA Today report from July 2011 that said there were ""nearly"" 500,000 workers earning $100,000 or more.

We checked with the Office of Personnel Management, which keeps data on federal employees and salaries. According to its Fed Scope database, the total civilian workforce was 2.14 million in June, the most recent month for which information was available. And at that time there were 459,016 federal workers who made at least $100,000 in average base salary each year.

That’s a little short of the 500,000 Romney claimed. It accounts for 21.5 percent of government employees, not 25 percent as he said. It's about 22 percent if you just look at ""permanent"" federal employees, which excludes temporary employees, student interns, the legislative and judicial branches along with the Postal Service and the military.

""Governor Romney said over one quarter of federal workers make more than $100,000. He meant to say nearly a quarter,'' said Ryan Williams, a campaign spokesman.

Some studies have claimed that government workers earn higher salaries than private-sector workers, but federal officials say that's an apples and oranges comparison. OPM Director John Berry has said the studies fail to recognize that federal jobs require workers who are more educated and need higher skills.

John Palguta, vice president with the Partnership for Public Service, a group that encourages people to work in government, said the studies don't prove that federal workers are overpaid.

""There is no convincing evidence that a significant percentage of those federal employees who are paid above $100,000 a year are being paid at a level that is above what major private sector employers pay their employees in similar occupations, with similar levels of responsibility, and which require similar knowledge, skills, and abilities,’’ he said.

It's worth noting that studies show federal salaries rose significantly under former President George W. Bush, and then by greater amounts under President Obama.

Our Ruling

Romney was slightly off by saying 25 percent, but the actual number is 21.5 percent, so he was in the ballpark. We rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971A7500>],/factchecks/2011/sep/03/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-500000-federal-workers-earn-more-/

Maureen Dowd says Ron Paul insisted FEMA should be shut down
","
Commenting on the federal response to Hurricane Irene, New York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd wrote Aug. 30, 2011 that Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul’s scorn of government is ""so great that he doesn’t even want it to coordinate (relief) in natural disasters.""

Dowd’s column says next that the Texas congressman insisted the Federal Emergency Management Agency, ""which (Paul) calls ‘a giant contributor to deficit financing,’ should be shut down.""

Paul has long advocated less dependence on government. But does he want to fold FEMA, the agency entrusted with coordinating disaster response?

Some background: President Jimmy Carter created FEMA through a 1979 executive order merging disaster-aid agencies across the government. Yet the agency says federal involvement in disaster relief began with an 1803 law enabling federal aid to a New Hampshire town after a fire. ""In the century that followed,"" FEMA says, ""ad hoc legislation was passed more than 100 times in response to hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters.""

After asking Paul’s campaign about his FEMA position, we found a CNN transcript of a May 13, 2011, interview of Paul by the network’s Wolf Blitzer, who asked if Paul wants to see the agency ended. Paul replied: ""Well, if you want to live in a free society, if you want to pay attention to the Constitution, why not? I think it's bad economics. I think it's bad morality. And it's bad constitutional law.""

Paul continued: ""Why should people like myself, who had, not too long ago, a house on the Gulf Coast and it's — it's expensive there, it's risky and it's dangerous. Why should somebody from the central part of the United States rebuild my house? Why shouldn't I have to buy my own insurance and protect about the potential danger?

""Well, the reason we don't have market insurance is it's too expensive. Well, why is it expensive? Because it's dangerous. Well, so why should — why should we take money from somebody else who (doesn’t) get the chance to live on the Gulf and make them pay to rebuild my house?""

""I mean it's — it's a moral hazard to say that government is always going to take care of us when we do dumb things. I'm trying to get people to not do dumb things. Besides, it's not authorized in the Constitution.""

More recently, according to MSNBC, Paul said in New Hampshire on Aug. 26, 2011 that ""there’s no magic about FEMA,"" adding that it’s a ""great contributor to deficit financing and quite frankly they don't have a penny in the bank. We should be coordinated but coordinated voluntarily with the states. A state can decide. We don't need somebody in Washington,"" the network quoted Paul saying.

On Aug. 28, 2011, Paul spoke again about FEMA. According to video posted by Fox News, ""Fox News Sunday"" anchor Chris Wallace asked if Paul would do away with the agency and the things it was doing to help Americans faced with Hurricane Irene. Paul then described FEMA as inept in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, though he indicated he’s not inclined to shutter the agency immediately. ""No, you don’t get rid of something like that in one day,"" Paul said.

On Aug. 30, 2011, CNN’s Anderson Cooper prefaced a Paul interview by saying if elected president, Paul has said he’d do away with FEMA. Cooper shortly asked Paul: ""So you say we don't need FEMA. Why?"" Paul replied that ""they don't have a very good record. I mean, these natural disasters are very, very dangerous, so I don’t understand why we’d turn it over to a federal bureaucracy. Federal bureaucracies as a whole don’t do a very good job, but FEMA has the worst reputation of almost any of them."" He also said that the government should ""look at how things were handled before we had FEMA."" Later in the interview, Paul said the federal government should be available for disaster-related rescues.

"['Jobs', 'Virginia', 'George Allen']","
Allen says he substantially cut state government workforce as governor
","
Republican George Allen is promising he’ll help stop the growth of the federal government if he’s elected to the U.S. Senate next year.

He says he’ll bring to Washington the same kind of ""sweeping reform"" he brought to Virginia as governor from 1994 to 1998. His campaign website says that when Allen was governor, ""He challenged critics and sentiment that suggested it couldn’t be done, reining in government spending and substantially reducing the size of the state workforce.""

In this fact check, we’ll look at Allen’s claim that he substantially cut the number of state employees. In the near future, we’ll examine the other assertion in his statement: That Allen  ""reined in"" state spending.

Allen, while campaigning for governor, often said Virginia’s bureaucracy was bloated and vowed to make deep job cuts.  In his inaugural address, Allen proclaimed: ""The will of the people has been frustrated by an unholy alliance of manipulative well-heeled interests, entrenched bureaucrats, and political opportunists. It is time for this to end.""

So did Allen reduce the employment rolls?

Bill Riggs, spokesman for Allen’s senate campaign, pointed us to a Dec. 31, 1997, report from the state Department of Personnel & Training. It shows the number of full-time equivalent employees in the state’s executive branch -- under control of the governor -- was about 111,540 in December 1993, just before Allen took office. The number dropped to 101,450 in Allen’s last full month in December 1997. That’s a a decrease of 10,090 employees, or roughly 9 percent of the state workforce.

Figures from the Virginia Department of Human Resource Management confirm the 9 percent drop in the state’s executive branch.

When including employees in the legislative, judicial branches and at independent agencies -- such as the Virginia Lottery -- DHRM’s figures show the number of state employees went from about 115,750 in December 1993 to 110,250 in December 1997. That’s a drop of 5,500, or about 5 percent.

But there is debate over whether the reduction of employees really streamlined government, because while Virginia was shedding workers under Allen, it was also increasing its use of private contractors.

The centerpiece of Allen’s effort was a voluntary buyout for state workers created under the 1995 Workforce Transition Act. About 5,500 bureaucrats took advantage of the buyout, causing ""the largest such exodus ever in Virginia,"" according to a Richmond Times-Dispatch article in 1997.

The greatest impact was in the Virginia Department of Transportation. About 1,300 employees decided to take the buyout, roughly 10 percent of that agency’s workforce. The state budget had funds to pay 11,570 VDOT workers when Allen took office. The final budget Allen proposed, for  the 1998-2000 biennium, paid for 10,262 employees.

But just because people left their state job with a buyout didn’t mean they stopped working for Virginia. Some of them, as documented in news reports from the time, went to work for private firms that contracted with VDOT.

Allen’s supporters and detractors traded barbs over the level of savings from the buyout program.

Allen, in 1997, estimated the buyout saved $134 million a year. But critics said his figure ignored the costs of paying millions of dollars in overtime, contracting out work and hiring replacements.

The Democratic-controlled House Appropriations Committee estimated that the savings might only amount to $13 million to $17 million in fiscal 1998.  

Allen’s defenders argued privatizing state functions streamlined government and was cost efficient.

But a November 1998 report by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission found that in least in one case, contracting out jobs cost more money. Outsourcing bridge inspections over the three previous fiscal years cost the state $4.7 million more than if it VDOT had used in-house staff, according to the report.

A JLARC report showed that contracting increased during the Allen years, in part, due to the drop in staffing from the buyout. The number of VDOT projects that consultants worked on doubled from about 350 in fiscal year 1994 to 700 in fiscal year 1998.

The value of outstanding VDOT consulting contracts also increased, going from about $300 million on January 1, 1994 to nearly $700 million on Janurary 1, 1998.

In addition to the buyout, Allen also used a hiring freeze and attrition to lower the state workforce. Jobs related to health and public safety were exempt from the freeze.

Gov. James Gilmore, a Republican who succeeded Allen, eased the hiring freeze shortly after taking office by allowing cabinet secretaries to set their agency employment levels, according to a July, 1998 article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. That was a change from Allen’s practice of having staffing largely controlled by the Department of Planning and Budget, according to the article.

In subsequent years, the number of state employees was on the rise, increasing to about 115,500 by June 30, 2000.

To sum up:

Allen says he substantially reduced the size of the state workforce. The number of state
employees did indeed drop during his administration. In the executive branch, which represents the bulk of state workers, the number declined by 10,000, or 9 percent.

It is important to note that as the number of state employees fell under Allen, Virginia’s reliance on private contractors rose. We can’t say how many of the departed bureaucrats went back to work for the state government -- albeit indirectly -- as private consultants. Those records don’t exist.

So we struggle to call Allen’s reduction substantial. We rate his statement Mostly True.

We checked White House records of the president’s schedule and found the El Paso trip was actually May 10, which was three months earlier, not four weeks. So Perry's timing is off.

As for the president's remarks, they were focused on immigration reform and border issues.
Obama said America is a ""nation of immigrants,"" and welcomed ""those willing to embrace America’s ideals and America’s precepts."" But he said the country’s ""broken"" immigration system needs reform  to ensure everyone achieves the ""American Dream.""

Here's what he said about border safety:

""Over the last two years, thanks to the outstanding work of Janet (Napolitano, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security) and Alan (Bersin, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection) and everybody who's down here working at the border, we've answered those concerns. Under their leadership, we have strengthened border security beyond what many believed was possible. They wanted more agents at the border. Well, we now have more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history.

""The Border Patrol has 20,000 agents -- more than twice as many as there were in 2004. It's a build-up that began under President Bush and that we've continued, and I had a chance to meet some of these outstanding agents, and actually saw some of them on horseback who looked pretty tough. (Laughter.) So we put the agents here.

Referring to Republicans who had called for tougher border protections, he said, ""They wanted a fence. Well, the fence is…The fence is now basically complete.

""We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement. All the stuff they asked for, we've done. But even though we've answered these concerns, I've got to say I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time.

""You know, they said we needed to triple the Border Patrol. Or now they're going to say we need to quadruple the Border Patrol. Or they'll want a higher fence. Maybe they'll need a moat. (Laughter.) Maybe they want alligators in the moat. (Laughter.) They'll never be satisfied. And I understand that. That's politics.

""But the truth is the measures we've put in place are getting results. Over the past two and a half years, we've seized 31 percent more drugs, 75 percent more currency, 64 percent more weapons than ever before. (Applause.) And even as we have stepped up patrols, apprehensions along the border have been cut by nearly 40 percent from two years ago. That means far fewer people are attempting to cross the border illegally.

""And also, despite a lot of breathless reports that have tagged places like El Paso as dangerous, violent crime in southwest border counties has dropped by a third. El Paso and other cities and towns along this border are consistently among the safest in the nation. (Applause.) Of course, we shouldn't accept any violence or crime. And we've always got more work to do. But this progress is important and it's not getting reported on.""

So did Obama actually say the border with Mexico and the United States is now ""safer than it ever way in history""? Let's review Obama's words:

He said there is more border enforcement than ever: ""They wanted more agents at the border. Well, we now have more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history.""

He said seizures and apprehensions are up: ""Over the past two and a half years, we've seized 31 percent more drugs, 75 percent more currency, 64 percent more weapons than ever before. (Applause.) And even as we have stepped up patrols, apprehensions along the border have been cut by nearly 40 percent from two years ago.""

He said violent crime is down: ""Violent crime in southwest border counties has dropped by a third.""

He said El Paso and other border cities are safe compared with other U.S. cities: ""El Paso and other cities and towns along this border are consistently among the safest in the nation.""

Perry is exaggerating. Obama did not actually ""pronounce that the border with Mexico and the United States was safer than it ever was in history."" His time references were primarily for recent years. Still, Obama's tone and his examples definitely supported the overall point that the border is safer now than it was before. We rate Perry's claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973CC700>],/factchecks/2011/sep/02/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-obama-boasted-crimes-border-towns-/
"['Patriotism', 'Florida', 'Bloggers']","
Bloggers say U.S. Reps. Corrine Brown, Alcee Hastings and Frederica Wilson are openly serving as Socialists
","
Word in the blogosphere is that scores of members of Congress are actually unabashed 'S' words.

That'd be Socialists.

Several bloggers have listed members of Congress by name under headlines like ""Why do Americans Keep Electing These Socialist Politicians to Congress??"" and ""Socialist Party of America Releases The Names of 70 Democrat Members of Congress Who Are Members Of Their Congress.""

The list -- actually a roster of Congressional Progressive Caucus members (mostly) from Wikipedia -- includes Florida Democrats Corrine Brown, Alcee Hastings and Frederica Wilson.

""I'm sure if you asked random people on the street if we had open socialists in the U.S. Congress, they would say – well only Bernie Sanders (Senate). But the right answer is much, much worse,"" goes an Aug. 12, 2011 post from the website Sovereign Citizens United.

On Aug. 17, 2011, citing a different caucus count, Texas radio host Dan Cofall wrote, ""The magic number '70' is the number of members of the 111th Congress who are members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). These are not just politicians who vote left of center; these are card-carrying members of ‘The Democratic Socialists of America’."" 
Our colleagues at PolitiFact Oregon vetted the bloggers' claim in this story, concentrating on Oregonian representatives. They pointed out that Cofall's figure is, for one, out of date because we have entered the 112th Congress. Several out-of-office House members from Florida were listed there. Still, his post targets many existing lawmakers. 
As our colleagues noted, the posts grabbed our attention for their blunt and far-reaching assertions. At PolitiFact Florida, we wanted to check out the claims that Brown, Hastings and Wilson are Socialists, or if it's a virtual Red Scare. 
Where did the list come from? 
Sovereign Citizens United connects the officials to socialism for their membership in the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the largest caucus (75 members) within the House Democratic caucus. Founded in 1991, the group of lawmakers supports policies that advance economic justice, civil rights and liberties, global peace and environmental protection, among other causes on its website.

We reached out to Sovereign Citizens United and heard back from a Montgomery, Penn., woman named Ruth Miller. Miller sent us several e-mails to back up her blog post.

""It is documented FACT that Socialist Bernie Sanders and Democratic Socialists of America created the Congressional Progressive Caucus in 1991 to further their socialist agenda in the US,"" she wrote. ""Any member of Congress who has joined this caucus expresses solidarity with socialism.""

Miller sent us to a KeyWiki page about the caucus, which claims that the DSA has worked closely with the progressives and links to an old DSA Detroit group's web page. ""As a national organization, DSA joins with its allies in Congress' Progressive Caucus and in many other progressive organizations, fighting for the interests of the average citizen both in legislative struggles and in other campaigns to educate the public on progressive issues and to secure progressive access to the media.""

Then Miller directed us to Henry Lamb, 73, who penned an undated commentary that inspired her blog post (she included an excerpt there). Lamb, founder of advocacy group Freedom 21 and retired chairman of Sovereignty International, said he wrote the essay to show ""how similar the organizations were at the time.""

Lamb wrote: ""Socialism in America is alive, well, and growing. Aided by such influential Congressmen as John Conyers, Ranking Member of the House Judicial Committee, David Bonior, the pit-bull-dog who successfully whipped Newt, Maxine Waters, the President's outspoken defender in the impeachment debates, and nearly 60 other Representatives, socialism is advancing in America behind the 'Progressive' label.""

He goes on to pull excerpts from the Democratic Socialists of America website that explain what the group believes. In a hot pink sidebar, Lamb listed 56 members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. It includes Brown and Hastings but not Wilson, as she was not yet elected to the House.

There's also no analysis of the Progressive Caucus. His piece contains no date, and Lamb -- to whom we spoke -- could not find it in his online archives.

So are they Socialists?

Neither Brown nor Wilson's office responded to calls and e-mails for comment. A spokeswoman for Hastings e-mailed only to say he was not a member of the Progressive Caucus, which is true -- this year. News accounts show he has been a member in the past.

Still, all three are serving as Democrats. All three list their political party affiliation as the Florida Democratic Party on their voter registration cards.

Brad Bauman, executive director of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said none of the group's members are Socialists.

""The members of Congress on our caucus are patriots who have chosen to serve,"" Bauman said, ""and to allege that they are not is just simply ridiculous.""

Even the Democratic Socialists of America does not claim the caucus members. PolitiFact Oregon interviewed the party's past national director of 10 years, Frank Llewellyn, who called the list ""completely fraudulent.""

More from PolitiFact Oregon: There is not one member of Congress who is a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. In order to join, a person must fill out a form and pay dues. Even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is not a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. The last member of Congress who was an actual card-carrying member, he said, was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998.

In a separate interview with PolitiFact Georgia, Llewellyn said the DSA had nothing to do with the creation of the caucus and would ""prefer an alternative third party that supports its values."" He outlined a couple policy differences with the progressives in Congress. He said his organization wants larger cuts in military spending and federal income tax rates returned to pre-Reagan administration levels, when they were much higher for the rich.

But what about Lamb, the man who wrote untold years ago that ""socialism is advancing in America behind the ""Progressive"" label""? He said it isn't wise to generalize. The name-calling reminds him of recent comments from Rep. Andre Carson, D-Ind., who said some of his tea party colleagues would like to see blacks ""hanging from a tree.""

""I think it would be equally silly for somebody to say that every member of the Progressive Caucus is a Socialist, even though you would have to share similar philosophies with socialist beliefs to sign up,"" Lamb said. ""That doesn't mean necessarily that you are a Socialist.""

Our ruling 
You've heard it from the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the Democratic Socialists of America and the author of the commentary that inspired the blog activity: Just because you are a member of the Progressive Caucus does not mean you are a socialist. And none of the caucus members profess to be Socialists, including our Florida Democrats, Brown, Hastings and Wilson. The bloggers go too far in attacking them as socialists, a repeated label for liberals these days.

Dennis Richardson says state employees received a 15.3 percent catch-up raise in 1981 contract
","
The Public Employees Retirement System is the topic that never quits doling out potential PolitiFacts. On the final day of the 2011 legislative session, for example, Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, had this to say about failed efforts to get public employees to start paying the 6 percent ""employee share"" that public employers (otherwise known as taxpayers) have been paying since 1979.

""In 1979, there was a collective bargaining agreement that said, ‘No pay increases but we'll pick up the 6 percent as the employer on the retirement plan.' In 1981, the negotiators for collective bargaining said, ‘We haven't had a raise in four years,’ and so they ended up with a 15.3 percent increase in pay, but the 6 percent payment toward the retirement plan didn't get repealed.""

In a follow-up e-mail to The Oregonian, he said that the 6 percent pickup should have been repealed with the 15.3 percent pay increase, ""but it was allowed to continue on top of the ‘catch-up’ pay increase."" 
Richardson’s assertion is significant because it could undermine a key argument made by public employees, who say they are entitled to the pickup because it was given to them in lieu of a raise. If they got a larger-than-usual raise to make up for no raise, as he claims, shouldn’t they forfeit the other benefit?

Many taxpayers might think so. But how correct are the representative’s facts?

Remember that the late 1970s and early 1980s were a time of severe economic stress. Inflation was in the double-digits, and cost-of-living raises for those lucky enough to have a job were similarly high.

Richardson is right that in May 1979, the state agreed to start paying the 6 percent retirement pickup previously withheld from employees’ paychecks.

But he’s not right that employees agreed to no pay increases in that contract negotiation, which covered July 1979 through June 1981. The labor agreement called for employees who made just under $12,000 a year to receive a 1 percent salary increase on July 1, 1979. Additionally,  all employees were to receive a maximum 2 percent cost-of-living increase five times over two years, up to 10 percent.

In July 1981, a new state contract gave all workers a $55 monthly increase -- which Richardson calculates as an average 4.3 percent increase. We agree. They also agreed to cost of living increases totalling 11 percent from January 1982 to March 1983. A union spokesperson told The Oregonian at the time that the package would result in pay raises of 15.6 percent to 19 percent. This is what Richardson considers the ""catch-up.""

Employees, however, did not get those raises as scheduled.

State workers received the $55 monthly increase and a 2 percent COLA in January 1982, but a severe recession that year meant that employees had to wait until July 1983 for the rest of their cost-of-living increases, which totalled 9 percent. Furthermore, they didn’t get COLA cost-of-living increases in 1983-85 because the economy was so bad.

So Richardson’s facts are not entirely accurate. Still, we wanted to know whether the increases state employees did receive beat inflation. In other words, how generous was the state?

Essentially, employees over 1979-81 received about a 16 percent ""wage"" increase, if you include the 6 percent retirement pickup. At the time, inflation was 25 percent -- or, to break it down, 14 percent in 1979, 13 percent in 1980 and 9 percent in 1981, adjusted for the state’s fiscal year calendars.

State employees continued to lag behind inflation with the next contract, even with the retirement pickup. The ""wage"" increase over 1979-83 was 22 percent, at a time when inflation was 33 percent. That’s at least a a more than 10 percentage-point gap.

The gap narrowed a little more with the 1983-85 contract: ""Wages"" increased 31 percent while the cost of living went up 39 percent. By the 1985-87 agreement, state workers’ wages had grown 39 percent since 1979 while the cost of living had gone up 43 percent. Again, that included the retirement benefit.

If your eyes are glazing over, jump to the ruling. For those who want more evidence, we asked Tom Potiowsky, Oregon’s former state economist now at Portland State University, and Joshua Lehner, an economist with Oregon’s Office of Economic Analysis, to check our math. They came to to the same conclusion, but used a slightly different time period.

Let’s start with a hypothetical $100 salary in June 1979. By July 1982 that $100 would be roughly $126 with the cost of living increases and 6 percent retirement money not being taken from paychecks. Inflation in the Portland-Salem area would have grown from $100 to $140, from 1978 to July 1982. So that’s a 15 percentage point difference.

By July 1983, the $100 would have grown to $138 for state workers, and $144.50 under inflation. ""This narrowed the gap, so that while inflation rose 44.5% from 1978 to July 1983, state wages rose 37.6 percent,"" Potiowsky said in an e-mail. ""Wages still did not recover from inflation from 1978 to July 1983.""

Presented with our findings, Richardson said in an e-mail that we should look at private sector wages and the rate at which those grew -- or didn’t -- over this period.

That wasn’t necessary for our ruling either, but the idea piqued our curiosity. So we turned to the crack economists at the Oregon Employment Department, who were kind enough to generate data on wages, adjusted for inflation to 1985 dollars.

According to Employment Department numbers, state government workers lost 1.7 percent of their earning power from 1979-85 while private sector workers lost 3.9 percent. Again, this does not include the 6 percent pickup contribution. (But if you look at the graph, which charts a longer period, you’ll see that everyone did poorly. Private sector wages declined less because they were lower to start with and they didn’t drop as much as state worker wages. By the way, federal employees fared best.)

The Ruling:
So, did state employees make out like bandits? That’s a matter of opinion. Readers can decide for themselves whether they did, and whether they should continue to get their retirement contributions paid. 
What we can say for sure is that even with the 6 percent retirement pickup added back to paychecks, the 15.3 percent so-called ""catch up"" raise was not out of line given inflation. And two, state workers didn’t get most of that 15.3 percent increase until the next biennium, at which point COLA cost-of-living increases were frozen for another two years.

State workers may have done better economically than private sector employees, but that’s not what Richardson said in his original statement. We find his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096EDF900>],/factchecks/2011/sep/02/dennis-richardson/dennis-richardson-says-state-employees-received-15/

Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele says county buses are no less safe now than a year or two ago
","
A spate of diametrically opposed claims about safety on Milwaukee County buses is the latest product of the increasingly bitter battle between Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. and County Executive Chris Abele.

The sheriff, whose agency helps police buses, released videos of student fights to dramatize that, as he put it, ""a ride on a Milwaukee county bus has become a frightening experience.""

The bad news aboard or around buses in December 2011 included a fight culminating in an attack against a mother who was with a 2-year-old child, an assault against a driver, a road-rage episode and stunning footage of beatings of students.

Taking a somewhat longer view, Abele told reporters there is no disturbing new trend.

""I think he’s misrepresenting the facts,"" Abele told CBS 58 TV reporter. ""If the sheriff has given you the impression that transit is less safe than it was a year ago or the year before that, then he’s giving the wrong impression.""

We’ll focus on that two-year time period, but also peek at how Clarke can say incidents on buses have spiked five years in a row since 2006, while Abele cites a big drop comparing 2011 to 2006.

This dispute escalated to the point that Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn stepped in to have his officers patrol buses, which prompted Clarke and Flynn to hammer at each other.

Both Clarke and Abele referred to data on ""incidents"" when we asked. But Clarke couldn’t show us numbers to back up his assertion of a five-year rise. Abele did produce transit system figures, but his claim of a drop comparing 2011 to 2006 is misleading because he compared the present to a high point.

In any event, the ""incidents"" figures are highly diluted. They include many hundreds of problems so minor -- sleeping on the bus, for example -- that neither law enforcement nor the transit system’s private security force was called in to deal with them.

So let’s stick to more serious incidents -- and Abele’s statement about the last two years. We’ll look at violence, lawbreaking and other security problems that required intervention by law enforcement or G4S, the private security company formerly known as Wackenhut.

Here’s our analysis of figures provided by the Milwaukee County Transit System (2011 figures are through Dec. 20).

Law enforcement responses: This is arguably the most important measurement, and the trend line goes up -- though in roller-coaster fashion around 600 responses per year.

Police were called in 12 percent more often in 2010 than in 2009, but those cases were on pace to fall about 5 percent in 2011 compared to 2010. So, buses were less safe this year than in 2009, but more safe this year than in 2010.

But if you look at the last two years mentioned by Abele, and compare the responses from the previous two years, they are up slightly, about 4 percent.

All responses: Counting all instances when police and/or private security was needed, incidents went up the last two years. This year, compared to 2009, they are up more than 13 percent.

Those are the broad numbers for police and private security responses. But there are hundreds of non-criminal episodes such as fare disputes included, though, so let’s take a closer look at the violent incidents.

Assaults and verbal altercations against passengers: Security was called -- and law enforcement sometimes dispatched --  in 150 such cases in 2011, up from 139 in 2010 and 106 in 2009. That’s two years in a row of increases, though it moderated in 2011, according to a report MCTS ran for us.

Assaults against drivers: This counts drivers struck by a person, but mainly by objects or fluids (such as spittle). There were 29 such incidents in 2009, 24 in 2010 and 25 this year. It’s fallen off more compared to 35 in 2008. There were six drivers struck by individuals in 2011, though not all of these cases were serious enough to warrant medical attention.

Non-violent lawbreaking: We only have two years of data here. It was virtually unchanged at nearly 900 incidents per year, this category includes threats, weapons incidents, off-bus fights and disorderly conduct, vandalism and profane/drunken behavior. The number represents how many time private security -- and police in some cases -- were called in.

Those are the numbers.

A transit spokeswoman sees no red flags in the fluctuations and mixed trends.

""There’s not an increase in crime, there’s an increase in attention,"" said Jacqueline Janz of MCTS.

The numbers are a bit of a mixed bag, but show lawbreaking and violence is a consistent, if relatively uncommon, phenomenon on county buses that -- MCTS officials are quick to point out -- provide 44 million passenger trips a year on 411 buses, most without incident.

Broadly speaking, it’s happening less now than five years ago, but more than it was two years ago, based on total responses by police and security. The Abele statement we are checking referred to the last two years.

Assaults on drivers are notably down over two to three years.

But looking at the broadest measure of serious problems (altercations among passengers), the history shows a significant increase two years in a row. That’s the time frame Abele referred to, and we think Clarke’s critique focuses mainly on these kind of serious incidents.

To be sure, there’s no dramatic swing up, as Clarke’s rhetoric implied. And the picture improves when the longer view is taken, though as we noted that’s selectively taking a high point as the starting point.

But Abele’s claim about buses being no less safe than a year or two ago flies in the face of the passenger altercation stats. Plus, Abele makes use of overly broad ""incident"" numbers that are highly misleading as a measure of crime.

There’s enough counter evidence -- the declining number of bus drivers struck -- to give Abele’s claim an element of truth. But it also gives a wrong impression.

That is our definition of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970B8240>],/factchecks/2012/jan/05/chris-abele/milwaukee-county-executive-chris-abele-says-county/

Cantor flops position on disaster aid offsets
","
When Tropical Storm Gaston slammed into central Virginia in August 2004, U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor went all out to get federal disaster aid for his constituents.

The Aug. 30 deluge dumped a foot of rain on the Richmond area in 10 hours, causing floods, landslides and eight deaths.

Cantor, R-7th, fired a letter to then-Homeland Secretary Tom Ridge, seeking ""immediate action"" from Washington.  ""Time is of the essence and it is important to start working on this matter so my constituents can receive help in this time of need,"" Cantor wrote.

He issued a news release stating, ""The magnitude of the damage suffered by the Richmond area is beyond what the Commonwealth can handle and that is why I have asked the president to make federal funds available for the citizens affected by Gaston.""

Cantor’s efforts helped the region obtain about $20 million in federal disaster aid. Cantor did not share the concern of some Republicans that the relief -- if not offset by cuts to other federal programs -- could deepen the national debt.

That October, Cantor was among 127 Republicans who voted against an amendment to an emergency supplemental bill for disaster aid that would have offset any increases in the relief with budget cuts. The amendment -- offered by Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas -- was handily defeated.

Now, let’s flash forward to 2011 and a new cauldron of disasters.

On May 22, a tornado devastated Joplin, Mo., leaving 142 dead. Cantor, now House majority leader, the next day voiced confidence the government would provide ample relief. But he said any supplemental emergency money would have to be offset by cuts to other federal programs.

Cantor, during a May 29 interview on ""Face the Nation,"" provided this explanation: ""When a family is struck with tragedy, like the family of Joplin ... let's say if they had $10,000 set aside to do something else with, to buy a new car ... and then they were struck with a sick member of the family or something, and needed to take that money to apply it to that, that's what they would do, because families don't have unlimited money.

""Neither does the federal government,"" Cantor said.

Cantor made similar comments to Fox News on Aug. 29. That was six days after Cantor’s constituents in Louisa County found themselves at the epicenter of a 5.8-magnitude earthquake. It was two days after Hurricane Irene pelted the East Coast, including Cantor’s district.

""Yes, there’s a federal role,"" Cantor said of disaster relief. ""Yes, we’re going to find the money. We’re just going to make sure that there are savings elsewhere to continue to do so.""

We asked Cantor’s office why the congressman voted against disaster aid offsets in 2004 and supports them today.

""In 2004, the national debt was under $8 trillion and was $8.67 trillion when (Democrat) Nancy Pelosi became Speaker,"" Brad Dayspring, Cantor’s spokesman, said in an email. ""Today the debt stands at $14.625 (trillion), meaning that while Democrats controlled the purse strings, the national debt increased by an astounding $6 trillion. That is a sign that we are dealing with a debt crisis and are living in different times. Looking back, the previous Republican majority probably made mistakes by not working to at least try to offset new spending.""

Dayspring noted that Cantor has often said the GOP lost control of the House in the 2006 elections because the Republican majority ""lost its way, particularly on spending issues."" He said Republicans regained control of the chamber in last year’s elections by ""pledging to be responsible stewards of federal dollars.""

""People and their families affected by these disasters will certainly get what they need from their federal government,"" Dayspring wrote.

""Is the suggestion that Congress should completely ignore the $14 trillion debt and make no effort to pay for things?"" he wrote. ""That seems quite extreme.""

Although Cantor has his reasons, there is no doubt he has changed positions on offsets to federal disaster aid. We rate it a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970844C0>],/factchecks/2011/sep/02/eric-cantor/cantor-flops-position-disaster-aid-offsets/
