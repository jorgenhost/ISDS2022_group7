2016 Portland arrests resurface, no connection to antifa
","A grid of mugshots shared after federal agents cracked down on protesters in Portland, Ore., says the arrested bunch are affiliated with antifa. A Facebook user posted the image on July 17 without comment. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There are a couple of issues with this context-free post. The mug shots are from arrests in 2016 Portland protests over the election of Donald Trump, not recent demonstrations stemming from the death of George Floyd.  And there’s no evidence for flatly stating that all nine people are members of antifa. Antifa stands for ""anti-fascist."" It’s a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing activists that’s been around for decades. Antifa activists include communists, socialists and anarchists who protest against white supremacy and other far-right causes. Sometimes they turn violent, although experts say the bulk of antifa organizing is nonviolent. ""There is no such thing as ‘antifa’ writ large,"" said historian and Rutgers University lecturer Mark Bray, author of ""Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,"" in an interview. ""These groups and their members try to make themselves anonymous as much as possible."" Many protests, some violent, have been held in Portland since Floyd died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck on May 25. Fires and break-ins in Portland on July 19 led Portland police to call that gathering a riot. The fact that many federal agents in Portland are not wearing identifiable law enforcement gear and not driving law enforcement vehicles has raised legal questions about the agents’ presence. The image shared on Facebook does not show arrests from these protests.  Our TinEye reverse image search found that the image dates back to 2016. News reports show 71 people were arrested in Portland on Nov. 12, 2016, on what was the fourth consecutive night of protests against Trump after his election. The Daily Mail published the Portland police mug shots, including those of the nine people shown in the Facebook post. Some online posts claimed that some of the nine are members of antifa, but we found no credible evidence for any of them in our Google searches of the names, seeking any links to antifa. Unless someone claimed to belong to an antifa organization, ""which is unlikely, then one would have to have evidence of them perhaps attending meetings of an antifa organization or perhaps evidence that they ran the social media account of an antifa organization,"" Bray said. The City of Portland paid James Mattox (at the top left in the image) nearly $23,000 to settle a lawsuit he filed over injuries he suffered in a 2018 ""counter-fascist protest."" He was seriously injured when a Portland police officer shot him in the arm with a rubber projectile. Mattox had admitted to yelling profanities at officers and flipping them off.  An image shared in a Facebook post claimed nine ""antifa members arrested"" in Portland, Ore. We found no evidence of antifa membership among the nine, who were arrested in an anti-Trump protest in Portland in 2016.

Donald Trump wrong to say U.S. has “one of the lowest mortality rates in the world” from COVID-19
","President Donald Trump defended his performance in fighting the coronavirus during an interview with Fox News’ Chris Wallace, insisting that the mortality rate from COVID-19 in the United States is among the world’s lowest. In the interview that aired July 19, Wallace and Trump were in the middle of a discussion about the coronavirus’ impact. Wallace said that ""we have the seventh-highest mortality rate in the world. Our mortality rate is higher than Brazil, it's higher than Russia and the European Union has us on a travel ban."" Trump responded that ""when you talk about mortality rates, I think it's the opposite. I think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world."" When Wallace fact-checked that characterization, Trump doubled down: ""I heard we had the best mortality rate. Number one low mortality rate."" Trump is wrong. Neither the White House nor the Trump campaign responded to an inquiry for this article.  Scientists define ""mortality rate"" as a measure of how frequently death occurs within a defined population. Data on this question is imperfect because of reporting inconsistencies between and even within countries. We turned to widely cited coronavirus data compiled by Johns Hopkins University to analyze Trump’s assertion. Specifically, we looked at the university’s calculations of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 in population, which is a standard measurement of mortality rate. First, we compared the United States with other nations that have been hard-hit by the coronavirus. To do this, we looked at all nations that have recorded at least 100,000 confirmed cases.   The United States has the sixth-highest mortality rate using this metric, behind the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Chile and France. But 16 hard-hit nations had a lower mortality rate: Peru, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Iran, Colombia, Germany, South Africa, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Argentina, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. We also looked at how the United States compared with its peers among advanced industrialized nations.    In this comparison, six countries had higher mortality rates than the United States: Belgium, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Sweden, and France. But 15 countries had lower mortality rates than the United States: Ireland, the Netherlands, Canada, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Germany, Denmark, Austria, Finland, Norway, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. By neither comparison is Trump close to correct. Mortality rate is strongly related to the age distribution in a country, said Brooke Nichols, a health economist and infectious disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health. ""The countries with the lowest mortality rates will probably end up being the ones with the younger population age structures,"" she said. When ""Fox News Sunday"" aired the interview, Wallace said the White House had been referring to the ""case-fatality rate"" rather than the mortality rate. (White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany handed Trump a paper chart citing ""case-fatality rate"" during the interview.) The case-fatality rate is not the same as the mortality rate. The case-fatality rate shows how likely you are to die from the coronavirus if you are infected with it. The mortality rate shows how common it is to die of coronavirus in a particular population, such as a country. Trump’s point about the U.S. is not more accurate when looking at the case-fatality rate compared with other countries.   Nine countries have a higher case-fatality rate than the United States. One country, Peru, has an equal rate and 11 have a lower rate: Colombia, Chile, Turkey, India, Pakistan, Argentina, Russia, South Africa, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Nichols said that the younger populations of many developing countries helps explain why their case-fatality rates are lower than that of the United States. (Infected patients who are younger and, often, healthier tend to die at lower rates from the coronavirus.) And when you compare the United States with its industrialized peers, seven countries have a lower case-fatality rate: Austria, Portugal, Norway, South Korea, Luxembourg, New Zealand and Australia.   Nichols said that the U.S ranks relatively low on this measure because, despite its problems rolling out testing, it still handles more tests per capita than most other comparable countries. Trump said, ""We have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world"" from coronavirus. The United States doesn’t have one of the world’s lowest mortality rates from the coronavirus: No fewer than 15 advanced, industrialized nations currently have a lower mortality rate, as do a host of other countries, including Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Russia, Turkey, Argentina, and India. Another measurement called the case-fatality rate, which Trump incorrectly referred to as the ""mortality rate,"" doesn’t place the United States at or near the bottom internationally.

Yes, Biden has said 150 million Americans died from guns and another 120 million from COVID-19
","Former Vice President Joe Biden has drawn mockery and criticism — primarily from conservatives — for verbal missteps throughout his presidential campaign. One recent Facebook post pulled out two statistical claims in particular, connected to gun violence and COVID-19. The July 13, 2020, post said with a laughing emoji: ""America has around 300 million people. Joe Biden said 150 MILLION were lost to gun violence AND we just lost ANOTHER 120 million to covid-19. So I’m reaching out to my friends to see if ANY of you are still alive"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). This is obviously a joke, but it raises a question about Biden’s comments. Did he really claim both of those statistics at some point?   Yes, Biden made these claims on two separate occasions, though for one he corrected himself immediately. Biden made the claim regarding the U.S. COVID-19 death toll on June 25, 2020, at a campaign event in Pennsylvania. He was talking about health care coverage with families. An ABC News Facebook Live video shows an attendee at the event mentioned the stress she felt over finances in addition to stress from hospital treatments, and how it all lowered her already low mental health at that time. Biden answered he intended to invest in mental health. ""That’s why we have a major multibillion dollar investment in mental health,"" Biden said. ""What people drastically underestimate is the impact on the mental health of people who now, everything is complicated. People don’t have a job. People don’t have anywhere to go. They don’t know what they’re going to do."" He went on to say ""Now we have over 120 million dead from COVID, I mean, 120,000 dead from COVID,"" according to audio obtained by Snopes.com. Biden made the gun violence claim in the final Democratic primary debate on Feb. 25, 2020, in South Carolina, where he said that 150 million Americans died since 2007 due to gun violence. ""In addition to that, I passed the Brady Bill with waiting periods. I led that fight. But my friend on my right,"" Biden said, gesturing to U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, ""and others have in fact also gave in to the gun manufacturers absolute immunity. Imagine if I stood here and said we give immunity to drug companies. We give immunity to tobacco companies. That has caused carnage on our streets; 150 million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt gun manufacturers from liability. More than all the wars, including Vietnam, from that point on."" So, the Facebook post is correct in that he made these claims, though it omits the date range Biden used and doesn’t give Biden credit for immediately correcting the COVID data error. In both cases, Biden or his staff acknowledged he intended to say thousands, not millions.  As Biden noted a moment after referencing millions of COVID deaths the current death toll remains in the thousands. As of June 25, 2020 when he made this statement, the death toll was more than 119,000, according to the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center dashboard. On the gun violence claim, a member of Biden’s campaign said Biden meant to say 150,000 people. Biden has previously referenced that stat correctly. Data from the CDC shows from 2007 to 2018 there were 148,182 firearm homicides. A Facebook post said Biden said 120 million Americans died from COVID-19 and that 150 million Americans died from gun violence since 2007.  Both of those numbers are drastically wrong. Biden meant to say ""thousands"" in both cases, not ""millions."" The post is correct that Biden did make these claims, but after misstating the COVID stat he immediately corrected himself, a detail the post omits. We rate this claim Mostly True.

State holds power over school re-openings
","Rep. Tom Reed weighed into the debate over how to begin the new school year amid the Covid-19 pandemic. It should be up to local authorities - not the state - to establish their re-opening plans, Reed said.  ""I caught the governor’s comment yesterday that ‘opening the schools is not the president’s choice,’"" Reed said during a news conference in Buffalo on July 9. ""That’s true. That is a local determination, but it’s not a state determination.""  Reed, a Republican from Corning who said he wants to see schools re-open, said that the state ""should defer to the local school districts, and the superintendents, and the school boards. They’re the ones that know their school districts.""  He added: ""It’s not the governor’s call either. It’s the local officials that should be doing that.""  Since reopening schools matters to parents, teachers and employers among many others, we wondered if Reed is correct, that the decision to reopen is a local determination, not a state one.  We consulted with five people who work in education and know New York well, including lawyers, people who study education and a representative of school superintendents.  Their opinions differed on Reed’s statement. Some said an argument could be made for local or state authorities holding the power, while others said that executive authority during an emergency gives the governor control. Another said the state has authority over the districts regardless of whether a state of emergency has been declared.  During an emergency, the governor has complete authority to open and close public schools, said Brian Backstrom, director of education policy studies at the Rockefeller Institute of Government, part of the State University of New York. The details of how schools will operate will be left to the state Board of Regents in consultation with districts, but the governor will set the standards for when districts can be open, Backstrom said. 
  A spokesman for Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Jason Conwall, said that schools typically have local authority, but that during a declared emergency, the governor’s powers supersede local governments. The schools were closed by an executive order, Conwall said, and will be reopened by one.  Conwall directed us to several executive orders that Cuomo has issued since the coronavirus became a concern in New York, including 202.4, which closed ""every school in the state of New York"" by March 18, for two weeks. It was subsequently extended by other orders. On May 7, executive order 202.28 closed schools through the end of the school year. These orders stipulated that state aid would not be lost by the districts because they are closed. An executive order on June 5 allowed for in-person special education instruction for summer school. A subsequent order, 202.45, issued June 26, continued to close schools to in-person instruction, except for special education.   The executive director of an organization that advocates for public school students said that districts are creations of state governments, and that states have authority over opening and closing, even in non-emergency situations.  ""When you think about it legally, in New York, like in all 50 states, (states) are required to maintain and support public school systems,"" said David Sciarra of the Education Law Center, which is based in New Jersey and is partially funded by teachers’ unions.  ""Authority is granted by the state, period, pandemic or not,"" he said.  But some experts said that in times when an emergency has not been declared by the governor, the circumstances would be different.  Several, including Robert Lowry, deputy director for advocacy, research and communications at the New York State Council of School Superintendents, said that public schools must be in session for 180 days in New York or they risk losing state aid for every day they are not in session.  ""A district could elect to remain closed, but few districts would be willing to go more than a few days losing aid,"" Lowry said.  Lowry pointed to Section 3604 of state education law, which provides that the state education commissioner may forgive state aid penalties for ""any day or days on which session had been previously scheduled but the superintendent was required to close the school or schools due to a properly executed declaration of a state or local state of emergency."" Cuomo signed such an executive order on March 7.   Kathryn McCary, an education lawyer based in Schenectady, said that although public school districts have ""significant local autonomy"" and are funded with property taxes raised locally, they are dependent upon state aid, as well as federal funding for certain programs. ""So yes, it is theoretically a local decision, but it isn’t an unconstrained one,"" she said.  David Bloomfield, an education lawyer and professor at Brooklyn College and The CUNY Graduate Center, said that in New York, reopening would typically be a local determination, as long as the district meets the statutory 180-day minimum attendance requirement. But Cuomo, under executive powers conferred to him by the Legislature, has emergency authority that preempts local school boards.  We also approached Reed’s office for evidence of his claim.  ""School districts in collaboration with other local elected officials, teachers, and parents, as opposed to one-size-fits-all mandates from Albany, should determine school reopenings,"" Reed said in a statement. ""Members of our school boards are duly elected by the communities they serve and are in the best position to determine the appropriate course of action for their students and teachers, including when to safely reopen."" In April, PolitiFact New York found that both New York state and New York City had authority to close New York City schools.   Reed said that the decision to open schools is not a state determination. School calendars are typically set by districts, as long as they can meet the state’s 180-day statutory requirement.  During this pandemic, however, the governor closed the schools by executive order, and Cuomo’s spokesman said that he will be opening them by executive order. A few days after  Reed made his statement, the executive branch and the state Education Department announced guidelines and detailed what should be contained in plans for re-opening. If districts do not work with the state, and seek its approval for their reopening plans, they could lose state funding.  We rate Reed’s statement False. ",/factchecks/2020/jul/18/tom-reed/state-holds-power-over-school-re-openings/

Tillis omits key facts about Cunningham, PPP
","North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis is accusing his opponent of being a hypocrite. Tillis, a Republican, recently criticized Democrat Cal Cunningham for criticizing a federal government bailout program that benefited ""his"" company. ""I supported the Paycheck Protection Program because it helped save one million NC jobs. Cal Cunningham criticized it while his company benefitted,"" Tillis tweeted on July 7. Tillis later called Cunningham a ""hypocrite."" There have been several other claims about Cunningham, the PPP funding and WasteZero that are worth clearing up. The National Republican Senatorial Committee tweeted on July 7 that Cunningham ""used"" funding from the program. In a press conference on July 16, North Carolina GOP Chairman Michael Whatley claimed that Cunningham ""was working on this (PPP) application at the same time as he was criticizing it."" Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for Cunningham’s campaign tweeted about the issue, referring to Cunningham’s employment in the past tense. But we’re going to focus on the Tillis tweet from July 7, since he’s a U.S. Senator levying a claim. Along the way, you’ll notice other claims are misleading or simply unfounded. Here’s a summary of what we found. Has Cunningham ""criticized"" the PPP rollout? He offered what some might call constructive criticism. He has said he supports the program, but says that administrators need to do a better job of getting funding to deserving companies. Tillis has also expressed concerns about getting money to small businesses.  Is WasteZero Cunningham’s company? Cunningham is not a founder and the campaign says he has no ownership stake. He was on the payroll for seven years and now works for the firm on a contract basis. Did Cunningham help WasteZero apply for the PPP funds or benefit from them? WasteZero’s CEO says no. The Paycheck Protection Program was launched as part of the federal government’s coronavirus relief package. It offers loans designed to encourage small businesses to keep workers on their payroll during the pandemic. While the program has helped people, it has drawn criticism too. The Washington Post reported that the first pool of loan money — worth $350 billion — was gone by April 16 and left 80% of applicants without aid. Businesses that received loans came under scrutiny. The first wave of recipients included 43 companies that have more than the maximum number of employees typically allowed under the program, the Post reported. Recipients have also included people with connections to President Donald Trump, such as Kanye West and Jared Kushner’s family. The claim about Cunningham and his employer, WasteZero, was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news outlet. The company was founded in 1991, the year Cunningham turned 18 year-old. It hired Cunningham in 2013 to be its chief marketing officer, according to a press release.  PPP records show that WasteZero applied for between $1 million and $2 million in loans and was approved for aid on May 3, potentially helping 115 employees. Cunningham’s campaign told the Charlotte Observer that he left WasteZero on March 20, a week before President Trump signed the PPP into law on March 27.  A WasteZero payroll document shows Cunningham’s job as general counsel was ""terminated"" on March 20. The campaign provided the payroll document to PolitiFact, and WasteZero CEO David Bryla verified its authenticity. However, Bryla and Cunningham himself say he still does contract work for WasteZero and is paid on an hourly basis. A company report filed in Massachusetts was signed by Cunningham on March 31. The report covered the 2019 calendar year. On one part of the report, Cunningham is listed as a company vice president. But, when signing the contract, Cunningham referred to himself as ""other officer."" (An aside: The Tillis campaign has accused the Cunningham campaign of lying about his involvement with the company. The Tillis campaign points to discrepancies in how Cunningham and his campaign have described his work. Cunningham told a McClatchy reporter that he is helping the company ""transition"" to his successor, while a campaign spokeswoman tweeted that Cunningham ""used to"" work there. The Tillis campaign noted that the Charlotte Observer story had to be updated to include Cunningham’s work on March 31.) So, was Cunningham involved in the PPP application? Under the PPP program, small businesses could apply for a loan using payroll information dating back to February — when Cunningham would have been a full-time employee. Bryla, the company CEO, told PolitiFact that Cunningham ""was not involved in the application for PPP funds and did not benefit from them."" ""The decision to pursue a PPP loan in order to help keep our employees on payroll was made at the board level and spearheaded by me and our CFO,"" Bryla told PolitiFact in an email. ""Cal left company payroll on March 20, before the PPP loan application process even began, has not been on payroll since, and therefore was not among those on staff who have benefited from the loan, which has helped us maintain workers."" On July 16, North Carolina GOP Chairman Whatley said Cunningham should call on WasteZero to release its PPP application. Doing so, he said, would prove he had no connection to the application. (A quick reminder about the PolitiFact rating process: when a person makes a claim, the burden of proof is on that person. The speaker is responsible for providing evidence to support their claim.) Now let’s look at what Cunningham said about the PPP. Cunningham has mostly criticized the way the program was rolled out and its lack of oversight, not the existence of the program itself. In May, Cunningham told Spectrum News that the PPP money has ""ended up in some of the wrong hands."" He said: ""I think we need to focus on making sure small businesses can keep people on the payroll. And very important for North Carolina, a lot of women-owned and minority-owned businesses have been cut out of that very process. And finally, a very, very important – and it’s a priority I’ve been returning to time and again – we’re spending a lot of money. Necessarily in order to protect people in a time like this, there needs to be very robust accountability and oversight for how money is being spent."" His campaign released a pair of press releases calling for more oversight. In a tweet and Facebook post on June 17, he referenced a story by Axios, saying: ""For PPP loans to have ‘generally missed the industries and areas most heavily impacted by COVID-19’ is unacceptable. Leaving behind small businesses — and disproportionately those that are Black- and Latino-owned — harms communities. We need oversight."" Also on June 17, Cunningham spoke during an online forum hosted by WRAL. He described himself as a ""strong proponent of the interventions that are necessary to help keep our companies moving, keeping people on the payroll (through) measures like the Paycheck Protection Program."" Cunningham also told CNN he is ""very concerned"" about the lack of ""vigorous and meaningful mechanisms for oversight of federal stimulus money. He made similar comments to other outlets too, which the Tillis campaign referenced in their press release. Tillis, for his part, has also shared concerns about small business loans not getting to small businesses. Fox News host Dana Perino asked Tillis about the program during an interview on April 20. Perino played a clip of U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, a Republican from Florida who has also criticized the PPP rollout. In the clip, Scott says, ""banks should be helping those who need it the most, not, you know, who helps them."" After the clip is played, Perino asks Tillis if he shares Scott’s concerns. Tillis said: ""Yeah, I do. I think part of the problem is that some of the smaller businesses -- they don’t have the resources necessarily to even get the baseline documents that were needed to apply for the loan. We have to make sure in this next trunch that we’re casting a wider net with the smaller businesses."" Tillis said ""Cal Cunningham criticized (the Paycheck Protection Program) while his company benefitted."" Cunningham criticized the PPP to the extent that it wasn’t reaching enough companies and lacked adequate oversight -- and he’s not alone. Republican senators, including Tillis, have expressed similar concerns. As for WasteZero being ""his"" company, Cunningham currently works for the company on a contract basis. Cunningham was not a founder. And PolitiFact is not aware of any ownership stake he has in the company. Furthermore, the CEO says  Cunningham wasn’t involved in the PPP application, or the decision to pursue PPP funds. The tweet is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

"['Abortion', 'Peggy Hubbard']","
Founder of Planned Parenthood did not refer to Black women as weeds, was not Ku Klux Klan supporter
","Following the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion case, a U.S. Senate candidate’s Facebook post claimed Black abortion-rights activists are ""picking up the fight for a woman who founded Planned Parenthood."" Peggy Hubbard, an Illinois Republican who ran for U.S. Senate in 2020 and is running again this year, wrote in a Facebook post that Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger ""referred to Black women as weeds that needed to be plucked from their garden"" and was a ""white supremacist, supporter of the KKK and DEMOCRAT."" Sanger embraced the idea of eugenics, defined by the National Human Genome Research Institute as the ""scientifically inaccurate theory that humans can be improved through selective breeding of populations."" Her espousal of those ideas has led Planned Parenthood to take steps to distance her name from the organization. But Sanger never made that statement about Black women, according to historians and fact-checkers, and she was not a supporter of the KKK or a Democrat. She was a member of the Socialist Party. When asked via email if she could provide evidence to support her claim, Hubbard replied, ""Yes! Google!"" More than one inaccurate quote about ""human weeds"" has been attributed to Sanger, including that ​​""Slav, Latin and Hebrew immigrants are human weeds"" and that ""colored people are like human weeds."" But Sanger did not say or write either of those comments, according to PolitiFact and the Washington Post, respectively. And while Sanger spoke to a group connected to the KKK — called the Women of the Ku Klux Klan, a parallel, official organization — she described it in her 1938 autobiography as a willingness to talk to anyone in order to advocate for birth control. Her descriptions of the encounter suggested she was not a supporter; she described it as ""one of the weirdest experiences I had in lecturing."" Sanger did make other published comments about ""human weeds,"" including: ""How are we to breed a race of human thoroughbreds unless we follow the same plan? We must make this country into a garden of children instead of a disorderly back lot overrun with human weeds."" (1924) ""I was merely thinking of the poor mothers of congested districts of the East Side who had so poignantly begged me for relief, in order that the children they had already brought into the world might have a chance to grow into strong and stalwart Americans . . . Birth Control is not contraception indiscriminately and thoughtlessly practiced. It means the release and cultivation of the better racial elements in our society, and the gradual suppression, elimination and eventual extirpation of defective stocks — those human weeds which threaten the blooming of the finest flowers of American civilization.""(1923) Though many have noted that such statements today are widely regarded as objectionable, Sanger did not link the comments to any race or ethnicity. When Sanger worked on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, it was an ""overcrowded slum that was home to generations of immigrants, mostly Italian and Eastern European,"" according to the Margaret Sanger Papers Project, an editing effort launched in 1985 by historian Esther Katz and sponsored by New York University's  Department of History. For Sanger, ""eugenics was meant to begin with the voluntary use of birth control,"" Salon reported in 2011. It was at a time, prior to the Holocaust, when eugenics was a popular intellectual movement considered ""far more respectable than birth control,"" according to Salon, which said at that point, contraception was still legally banned under obscenity statutes. ""The purpose of eugenics was to improve the human race by having people be more healthy through exercise, recreation in parks, marriage to someone free from sexually transmitted diseases, well-baby clinics, immunizations, clean food and water, proper nutrition, non-smoking and drinking,"" said Ruth Engs, professor emeritus at the Indiana University School of Public Health and an expert in the movement, who was interviewed by PolitiFact New Hampshire in 2015. The Facebook post’s two-pronged claim — that Sanger referred to Black women as weeds and was a supporter of the KKK — implies that she was racist, but as PolitiFact reported in 2015, ""even authors who treat Sanger critically don’t believe she held negative views about African-Americans."" Jean H. Baker, who wrote a biography of Sanger and is the Bennett-Harwood professor of history at Goucher College in Maryland, told PolitiFact in 2015 that attempts to portray Sanger as a bigot are misguided. ""She was far ahead of her times in terms of opposing racial segregation,"" Baker said. ""She worked closely with Black leaders to open birth control clinics in Harlem and elsewhere. She believed all women should have the information about birth control that rich women had, hence her lecture to the KKK women."" Hubbard said Sanger referred to Black women as weeds that needed to be plucked from their garden, and was a supporter of the KKK and a Democrat But Sanger never made that statement about Black women, according to historians and multiple fact-checks. Sanger made remarks about ""human weeds"" that most people would find objectionable now, but she did not link the comments to any race or ethnicity. And Sanger did speak before the Women of the Ku Klux Klan, a group connected to the KKK, but she did so in her role as an advocate for birth control and not as a supporter.

State Crime Lab doing less testing and generally taking longer than under previous AG
","Delays at the state crime lab have been a front-burner issue every election cycle, including in 2018, when Democrat Josh Kaul won the attorney general’s job on promises to clear a backlog of DNA samples in sexual assault cases. Now, just as Kaul skewered then-Attorney General Brad Schimel, a Republican, one of the Republican candidates hoping to face Kaul in November 2022 is saying Kaul ""is trying to bury his abysmal failure of mismanaging the crime lab."" In an April 14 , 2022, news release, Fond du Lac County District Attorney Eric Toney went on to claim that Kaul ""is testing significantly less items than former AG Brad Schimel and is still taking longer to test many categories of key items in comparison to Schimel, including DNA."" Is he right? When asked for data to support his claim, Toney directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to an annual report from Kaul’s own Department of Justice. We should note that while it’s commonly referred to as the State Crime Lab, there are actually three labs where testing is done – Madison, Milwaukee and Wausau. For our purposes here, we will group them all together. When looking at overall cases, in 2018, Schimel’s last year, the crime lab took 12,680 cases. In 2021, under Kaul that fell to 9,297 cases – a more than 30% drop. So Toney is right that Kaul ""is testing significantly less items than former AG Brad Schimel."" According to the labs’ 2021 annual report, in the 10 categories analyzed, turnaround took more time in six of them under Kaul than under Schimel. Let’s start with DNA, since that is what Toney emphasized in his claim. The report actually breaks down DNA in two areas. DNA analysis involves analyzing and interpreting samples, and comparing them to others. The DNA databank category involves receiving, verifying and analyzing a repository of reference samples. Before we get started, there is an important nuance to note on the intake and output figures. The output figure can be higher than the input figure, and vice versa, since a sample may come in late one year and not be completed until the next year. In both DNA areas, under Kaul the crime lab is handling fewer cases and taking longer with them. In the DNA analysis category, in 2018 the lab had a case intake of 8,626, case output of 5,664 and median turnaround time was 50 days. In 2021, case intake was 3,612, case output was 3,526 and median turnaround was 115 days – more than double. In the DNA databank category, in 2018 sample intake was 29,900 and turnaround time was 24 days. In 2021 sample intake was 20,736 and median turnaround time was 41 days. Here are the other five areas where the lab is lagging 2018 numbers: In the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) category, the quality control figure was 131,412 in 2018 under Schimel and 83,072 in 2021 under Kaul. The system performs comparative analysis of submitted fingerprints, including conducting database searches and provides technical and analytical support to state and federal agencies. According to the DOJ, this is the check an analyst has to do any time a set of fingerprints is submitted. Analysts check to make sure they’re putting quality prints in the database – that is, ones not smudged or less readable. ""If someone has prints submitted multiple times, even decades apart, our analysts review both sets and retain the clearest version of each finger,"" said Gillian Drummond, the DOJ spokeswoman. In the controlled substances category, in 2018 case intake was 5,283, case output was 5,422 and median turnaround time was 35 days. In 2021, case intake was 4,430, output was 3,522 and median turnaround time was 49 days. In firearms, in 2018 case intake was 446, output was 419 with median turnaround time of 87 days. In 2021, case intake was 437, output was 399 and median turnaround time was 104 days. In toxicology, in 2018 case intake was 3,897, output was 4,051 and median turnaround was 23 days; in 2021 case intake was 4,073, output was 4,078 with median turnaround time of 27 days. In forensic imaging, in 2018 case intake was 62, output was 59 and median turnaround time was 25 days. In 2021, case intake was 84, output was 71 and median turnaround was 55 days. So, on those six areas, there generally were fewer cases handled and the median time to complete them was longer, sometimes considerably so. And Toney’s claim was a narrow one – not that turnaround was up in all categories, but in ""many"" categories. That said, it’s worth noting Kaul did have a better showing in turnaround time in some areas: For instance, the median turnaround time in the latent prints category was 43 days in 2021, compared to 139 in 2018, under Schimel. In trace evidence, it was 29 days, compared to 58. Additionally, in the footwear category, Kaul’s median turnaround was 11 days, compared to 134 under Schimel. And in crime scene responses, Kaul did better, with 155 responses to Schimel’s 122. The arrival of the pandemic and its effect on daily lives and workplaces nationwide also had an effect at the Wisconsin Department of Justice. In its 2021 report, the Department of Justice noted that COVID-19 created various ""challenges"" for the agency, affecting its work flow and, in some cases, the ability of staff members to work from home. For instance, according to department spokeswoman Gillian Drummond, social-distance requirements meant staggered shifts and were tough to address in Milwaukee and Wausau, due to space issues. ""Further, following court closures in 2020, there was a spike in jury trials in 2021, increasing the amount of time staff were away from laboratory benchwork in order to testify,"" the agency report said. ""These consequences of the pandemic impacted case queues and, in turn, turnaround times."" For his part, in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Toney argued ""the private sector, first responders, prosecutors, and court staff across Wisconsin juggled staffing and Covid issues and found ways to be in person throughout 2021, often in cramped settings."" Both sides make fair points here – even if Kaul’s office may be being selective, in that the COVID conditions they blame for some delays did not seem to hamper other areas, where timeliness improved. Toney claimed the state crime lab under Kaul ""is testing significantly less items than former AG Brad Schimel and is still taking longer to test many categories of key items in comparison to Schimel, including DNA."" Reports from the Department of Justice show that overall cases are down from 2018, Schimel’s last year at the helm, and 2021 under Kaul. What’s more, in six of 10 categories monitored, including the vital DNA category, the median processing time is up under Kaul, sometimes dramatically so. And while the lab under Kaul improved in some areas, Toney’s claim was limited in scope – to ""many categories."" We feel he met that mark, and rate his claim True.      ",/factchecks/2022/may/10/eric-toney/state-crime-lab-doing-less-testing-and-generally-t/

Chuck Grassley left the Senate Finance Committee? That's wrong
","Mike Franken, a retired U.S. Navy admiral seeking Iowa’s Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat in this year’s general election, took aim on May 5 at his party’s biggest target in the race: longtime Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley.  Franken’s launch pad was Twitter, with a since-deleted message: ""Senator Grassley hopped off the Finance Committee, where he could be helpful to Iowa and the nation, in favor of the Judiciary Committee…where he is a tool for the radical right, even some insurrectionists.""   Except that Grassley never left the Senate Committee on Finance.  Franken campaign manager Julie Stauch clarified Franken’s tweet in an email to PolitiFact Iowa. ""The tweet should have read Senate Finance Committee Chairmanship. It was in reference to Grassley choosing to chair the Judiciary Committee over Finance in order to impede the Senate rules regarding judicial appointments,"" she wrote. Stauch said the tweet was taken down the next morning after PolitiFact Iowa contacted her. Grassley certainly angered Democrats while leading the judiciary committee as he moved Republican President Donald Trump’s judicial nominees at a rate that far exceeded that or Democratic President Barack Obama. Notably, Democrats were upset when Grassley did not move on Obama’s 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court because, Grassley and other Republican Senate leaders said, it was an election year. Then, in 2020, he pushed for and presided over as president pro tem of the Republican-led Senate the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. Trump nominated Barrett a little more than one month before the 2020 presidential election and the Senate confirmed her in one month. Obama nominated Merrick eight months before the 2016 presidential election.  The Pew Research Center reported at the end of Trump’s term that the Republican-led Senate approved as many Trump judicial nominees in four years as Obama nominees in eight years. An Iowa Law Review article accused Grassley of ignoring or diluting rules and customs for judicial appointments while chairing the Judiciary Committee in order to meet Republican goals for thwarting Obama court nominations. Grassley was the Finance Committee’s chairman for six months in 2001, and again from January 2003 to January 2007 and January 2019 to January 2021. He also was the ranking minority member from June 2001 to January 2003 and from January 2007 to January 2011.  Republican Party rules for U.S. Senate committee leadership say that members may not serve more than three two-year terms as a committee chair or minority ranking member. The rules also state a Republican cannot serve as a chair or ranking member for more than one committee, with a few exceptions for the ethics committee and joint committees for printing and the Library of Congress.  Grassley is not the ranking minority member of the finance committee but has that role on the Committee on the Judiciary, while remaining on the finance committee  as a senior member. Grassley also serves on the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; Committee on the Budget; Joint Committee on Taxation, and is vice chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control. ""Grassley’s leadership and committee assignments ensure Iowans have an influential voice at the policymaking tables, advocating for Iowans in the most pressing issues of our day,"" Grassley campaign communications director Michaela Sundermann wrote in an email to PolitiFact Iowa. ""Senator Grassley has achieved these assignments through years of hard work to ensure he weighs in on public policy important to the lives and livelihoods of Iowans."" Grassley has not missed a full committee hearing this year, Sundermann said. ""He holds that perfect attendance record while serving on multiple committees including Judiciary, Agriculture and Budget Committees,"" she wrote to PolitiFact Iowa. Franken, of Sioux City, is in a primary battle for the Democratic nomination with former U.S. Rep. Abby Finkenauer of Cedar Rapids, and Glenn Hurst, a physician from Minden. Grassley, for all of the national attention he gets because of his committee positions but also for his longevity in the Senate, is facing a primary challenge in the Republican Party from state Sen. Jim Carlin of Sioux City. Franken tried to portray Grassley as leaving a committee that Grassley never left. Even if you consider that Grassley left a leadership position on the finance committee to take a leadership role at the Committee on the Judiciary, Grassley remains a senior member of the finance committee, plus Republican rules prohibited him from having a leadership role on finance.  Franken’s campaign clarified the tweet when asked about it and eventually took it down the morning of May 6. But saying Grassley ""hopped off"" the Committee on Finance during 24 hours that the tweet existed was False. ",/factchecks/2022/may/09/mike-franken/chuck-grassley-left-senate-finance-committee-s-wro/

No evidence Blackburn wants to limit birth control to married couples only
","A leaked draft opinion by the Supreme Court that shows a majority of justices are prepared to overturn Roe v. Wade has some Americans worried that conservatives want to go even further. Numerous social media users claimed that U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., proposed limiting contraceptive use only to married couples. ""Get this! GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn has proposed that birth control should only be legal for MARRIED couples,"" read one May 8 tweet from Jon Cooper, a Democrat activist with nearly 970,000 followers.  This tweet and others misstated what the senator said on the subject of contraception. Prior to the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, Blackburn released a video where she described the 1965 Supreme Court ruling in Griswold v. Connecticut — one that overturned a state ban on contraception — as ""legally unsound."" ""Constitutionally unsound rulings like Griswold v. Connecticut, Kelo v. the city of New London, and NFIB vs. Sebelius confused Tennesseans and left Congress wondering who gave the court permission to bypass our system of checks and balances,"" Blackburn said in the video, where she expressed her opposition to Jackson’s nomination. The 7-2 court ruling in Griswold v. Connecticut said the Constitution’s First, Third, Fourth and Ninth Amendments created a right to privacy in a marriage, which the Connecticut law banning contraception violated. (The other cases Blackburn mentioned were about eminent domain and the Affordable Care Act.) The Griswold ruling was later cited as precedent in Roe v. Wade in 1973. Blackburn did not expound in the video on why she thought the ruling was unsound, nor did she make any proposals about birth control. It’s not clear if Blackburn was opposed to overturning a ban on contraception or if she thought the court overstepped and created a right not in the Constitution. We asked if she has ever proposed any laws or made any statements seeking to limit or ban the use of contraception for anyone, and Spencer Hurwitz, a spokesperson for Blackburn, referred us to a tweet by CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale, who said the senator’s position was being inaccurately described. Hurwitz declined to answer questions about why Blackburn thought the Griswold ruling was unsound or whether she supports any bans on contraception. Whether Senate Republicans will propose such action in the future is unclear.  The National Republican Senatorial Committee issued talking points on May 3 about abortion for legislators and candidates and one reads, ""Republicans DO NOT want to take away contraception."" Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, meanwhile, didn’t rule out laws on contraception in an interview Sunday on CNN’s ""State of the Union,"" but he said ""that is not what we’re focused on at this time."" Social media users are claiming that Blackburn proposed limiting contraception use to married couples only. Blackburn has not made any such proposal, either in the Senate or in public statements. She critiqued a Supreme Court ruling, Griswold v. Connecticut, that overturned the state’s ban on contraception on the basis of a married couple’s right to privacy. But Blackburn has not elaborated on her issue with the ruling, saying only that it was ""constitutionally unsound.""

Tennessee passed a ban on mailing abortion pills, not emergency contraceptives like Plan B
","If the Supreme Court votes to overturn Roe v. Wade, as a leaked draft majority opinion indicates it might, access to abortion would vary across states due to differing policies. Advocates of abortion rights are expressing concern that some states’ efforts will go further to curtail contraceptive use.  But has Tennessee already outright banned the emergency contraceptive known as Plan B?  Short answer, no. But that’s what many people were left wondering after claims started circulating online that said the state recently outlawed emergency contraceptives and will now fine people who try to get the medication. ""Tennessee just banned Plan B and made it a crime punishable by a $50,000 fine to order it,"" read a tweet from Pam Keith, CEO at the Center for Employment Justice and 2020 Democratic nominee for Florida’s 18th Congressional District. (Keith lost to Republican Rep. Brian Mast.) Tennessee did recently pass a law that restricts access to certain medications, but it did not involve Plan B. Known as the morning-after pill, Plan B is emergency contraception used to prevent pregnancy — not induce abortions — after unprotected sex or when a birth control method has failed. The medication is available over-the-counter and does not require a prescription. The legislation at the center of this claim, though, imposes strict restrictions on the dispensing of abortion pills. Signed by Republican Gov. Bill Lee on May 5, it doesn’t address or ban emergency contraceptives. The law includes a $50,000 penalty for doctors or anyone who dispenses abortion pills by mail. There is no criminal penalty for patients.  PolitiFact reached out to Keith for comment through her company’s website but did not hear back. However, on May 9, Keith tweeted that she made a mistake and deleted her original tweet. ""Hey all. I tweeted something about a change in Tennessee law criminalizing a component of women’s health care that I understood to be similar to the proposed bans in Louisiana and Missouri. I have taken it down,"" Keith wrote. Abortion pills refer to the medication option for abortion, usually taken in about the first 11 weeks of pregnancy. It involves a combination of two medicines — mifepristone and misoprostol — that are typically taken around 24 hours apart. Mifepristone blocks progesterone, the hormone needed to maintain a pregnancy, and misoprostol makes the uterus contract to complete the abortion.  The Tennessee Abortion-Inducing Drug Risk Protocol Act goes into effect Jan. 1, 2023. The legislation states that qualified medical clinicians are required to be physically present when abortion pills are given to patients. To lawfully receive abortion pills, a patient must visit a doctor, give consent, and then return to pick up the medication. Delivery of abortion pills by mail is prohibited. According to the measure, the drugs can only be dispensed by qualified physicians, a category that does not include pharmacists.  The legislation explicitly states that this applies to abortion-inducing drugs. ""This is not what this bill is doing,"" said Akram Faizer, associate professor of law at Lincoln Memorial University in Harrogate, Tennessee. ""Anything that can be treated as contraceptive would not be affected by this legislation."" Legal experts say it’s not yet known whether states like Tennessee can restrict access to abortion pills in the wake of the FDA's 2021 decision to allow mail-delivery of the medication nationwide.  It would likely come down to what happens with Roe v. Wade. If the draft Supreme Court ruling overturning the legislation is finalized, states could set laws about how and when to allow abortions — including restrictions on abortion pills.  ""State governments shouldn’t have jurisdiction over the mailing of things, that’s typically within federal jurisdiction,"" Faizer said. ""But if the federal government loses its jurisdiction to enforce abortion rights, that’s where things might change."" Keith claimed on Twitter that Tennessee banned the Plan B emergency contraceptive and made it a crime punishable by a $50,000 fine to order it. The legislation imposes restrictions on the dispensing of abortion pills, but it doesn’t ban emergency contraceptives like Plan B.  The $50,000 fine, meanwhile, is for anyone who provides abortion pills by mail. The measure exempts patients from criminal penalties.

Texas law targets abortion providers, not patients
","Days before Politico reported that a leaked U.S. Supreme Court draft opinion indicates that a majority intends to overturn Roe v. Wade, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tweeted an alarming claim about victims of rape in Texas. Ocasio-Cortez was addressing the claim from right-wing politicians that ""the extreme left is taking over."" To that, Ocasio-Cortez asked ""WHERE"" in all caps. ""In Texas, Republicans passed a law allowing rapists to sue their victims for getting an abortion,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. Texas has some of the strictest laws restricting access to abortion. As discussion and concern rises for Roe v. Wade — the landmark 1973 ruling that established a right to abortion — and what this means for Texas, let's look at Ocasio-Cortez's claim. We reached out to Ocasio-Cortez's media office and campaign email addresses but did not hear back. She seems to be referring to Senate Bill 8, which took effect in September. The law prohibits abortion after six weeks of pregnancy and leaves enforcement up to the public, allowing any person to sue abortion providers or people who aid or abet illegal abortions. There are no exceptions for pregnancies from rape or incest. But the law specifically prohibits a rapist from suing: ""Notwithstanding any other law, a civil action under this section may not be brought by a person who impregnated the abortion patient through an act of rape, sexual assault, incest, or any other act prohibited by Sections 22.011, 22.021, or 25.02. Penal Code."" This provision is the only limit placed on who can sue under the law. In addition, Ocasio-Cortez claimed that a victim's rapist could sue them. However, SB 8 permits people to sue providers and those who aid and abet someone who gets a prohibited abortion, not the person seeking an abortion. In other words, University of Houston law professor Seth Chandler said, the person seeking an abortion could not be sued under this law, but anyone helping them could.  ""Now, it is true that the defendant in an SB 8 action may need to prove that the plaintiff wasn't a rapist,"" Chandler wrote in a follow-up email. ""It's not entirely clear (since there are no cases) on whom the burden of proof lies. But to go from that to saying that Texas allows the rapist to sue strikes me as a canard."" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on April 29, ""In Texas, Republicans passed a law allowing rapists to sue their victims for getting an abortion."" The law specifically bars someone's rapist to sue because they sought a prohibited abortion. The law also allows actions against abortion providers, rather than the patient, for procedures past a pregnancy's six-week mark. We rate this claim as False.",/factchecks/2022/may/09/alexandria-ocasio-cortez/texas-law-targets-abortion-providers-not-patients/

Amber Heard didn’t steal lines from ‘The Talented Mr. Ripley’ during testimony in Depp trial
","Amber Heard’s testimony in the defamation trial initiated by ex-husband Johnny Depp launched a frenzy of news coverage as well as some false rumors. One popular claim said Heard’s testimony borrowed heavily from a monologue in the 1999 movie ""The Talented Mr. Ripley."" A viral tweet compared Heard’s alleged opening statement with lines from the movie, side by side: While the post shows a real quote from the movie, Heard didn’t say these words. The lines in the film are delivered by the character Marge Sherwood, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. They are as follows:  ""The thing with Dickie ... it’s like the sun shines on you, and it’s glorious. And then he forgets you and it’s very, very cold ... When you have his attention, you feel like you’re the only person in the world, that’s why everybody loves him so much."" The social media claims about Heard substituted the name Johnny for Dickie.  But Heard didn’t say this, according to video evidence from the trial, news reports and official transcripts. Fact-checkers from the Associated Press reviewed nearly seven hours of footage from the proceedings and also couldn’t locate the alleged quote. The rumor was similarly debunked by Newsweek and Snopes. Shortly after taking the stand Heard answered some basic questions about her name, age and profession. She described how she met Depp and talked about their relationship. Some social media users tried to compare parts of her testimony that used similar language as proof that she took lines from the movie, but the remarks contain significant differences. For example, about 34 minutes into her testimony, Heard said that when she was around Johnny, she ""felt like the most beautiful person in the world,"" and that he made her ""feel seen"" and feel like ""a million dollars,"" and then he would ""disappear.""  This is not what Paltrow says in the movie.  Depp sued Heard for libel after she accused him of domestic abuse in a 2018 opinion editorial in the Washington Post. Depp’s lawyer described the allegations as ""catastrophic"" to Depp’s career. Social media posts claim that Heard plagiarized lines from the movie ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" during her testimony in the defamation trial brought by her ex-husband. This is wrong.

More than 50 years ago in New York, Republican support for abortion
","A leaked draft opinion from Justice Samuel Alito to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark abortion rights decision Roe v. Wade has mobilized abortion rights advocates in New York state, where Democratic leaders said that they would maintain access to abortion.  State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, D-Yonkers, who spoke to reporters after the draft was leaked, said that when New York state legalized abortion, three years before Roe v. Wade was decided, Republicans held power in the Senate and some of them joined Democrats in supporting a measure to repeal the state’s ban on abortions.  ""Under a Republican majority in the Senate, those reproductive rights laws were passed,"" Stewart-Cousins said. ""And not only was it a Republican majority leadership in the Senate, but 12 Republicans joined the majority of Democrats in order to pass our reproductive rights bills here.""  Since then, the party has moved to the right on abortion. In 2019, when another abortion bill passed in New York, no Republicans in the state legislature supported it. Stewart-Cousins is right that Republicans supported legalizing abortion in 1970. At the time, Republicans controlled the Senate, the Assembly and the governor's office - but she got the tally wrong by one vote.  The New York State Library and librarian Michael Meyer sent us photocopies of the Senate vote on bill 8556-A, which was voted on by the Senate on April 10, 1970. A vote on March 18, 1970, in the Senate on a more liberal version of the legislation had an identical tally.  Thirteen Republican senators voted for the bill, which passed 31-26. The Senate had 57 districts in 1970. There are 63 districts today. We approached Stewart-Cousins’ office, and spokesperson Emily Bruggeman sent us a New York Times article stating that in the Senate, the vote was 31 to 26, with 13 Republicans and 18 Democrats in favor, and 20 Republicans and six Democrats voting against it.  Stewart-Cousins is correct that Republican leadership in the Senate allowed the bill to come to the floor, though the majority leader at the time, Sen. Earl Brydges of Niagara Falls, was no proponent of abortion. Brydges could have stopped the vote, but he did not. An abortion rights supporter told the New York Times that Brydges miscalculated, that he allowed a vote for a full repeal of the abortion ban, without restrictions, because he did not think it would pass.  Brydges reserved his comments during the floor debate for the roll call vote, and he said he was disturbed by the bill. ""I have kept my word to do nothing to keep this bill from coming to the floor or not to lobby personally against it,"" Brydges said, according to the New York Times. ""But I have a deep, real, abiding conviction that this is the wrong way for the state to go because we are a bellwether state and many other states will follow our lead.""  Gov. Nelson Rockefeller had been calling for changing the state’s abortion law and signed the measure in 1970. When a repeal of the legalization was passed in 1972, he vetoed it.  Stewart-Cousins said that legalization of abortion in New York state was approved with the support of 12 Republicans in the Senate. She missed one vote. The roll call shows 13 Republicans in the Senate supported the bill.  We rate her statement True, because being off by one vote doesn't significantly affect its accuracy.",/factchecks/2022/may/07/andrea-stewart-cousins/more-50-years-ago-new-york-republican-support-abor/

Dennis Prager baselessly claims Black students commit ‘overwhelming’ share of campus hate crimes
","Conservative radio host Dennis Prager baselessly claimed that when nooses are strung or racial slurs are graffitied on college campuses, ""the odds are overwhelming"" that the hate crime was really a hoax perpetrated by a Black student at the school. The claim came as Prager, the co-founder of PragerU, which makes conservative video content, riffed on his radio show about what Twitter will look like once billionaire Elon Musk takes over. ""Twitter will be flooded with hate, and a lot of it will come from people on the left who want to show how hate-filled it is,"" Prager said April 26. ""It's like their race hoax industry. If you see a noose on a college dorm of a Black student, the odds are overwhelming that the noose was put there by a Black student. If you see the n-word on a dormitory building, the odds are overwhelming that a Black student actually did that. We're filled with race hoaxes."" Prager referenced Jussie Smollett, the ""Empire"" actor who in 2019 paid associates to stage an attack against him in Chicago. Smollett was sentenced to 150 days in jail and ordered to pay a $145,000 fine for lying to police about being the victim of a hate crime. Though a noose was involved in what Smollett framed as a racist and homophobic attack by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, Smollett was not a university student.  Prager offered no evidence on his show or in response to PolitiFact’s inquiry that Black students are ""overwhelmingly"" responsible for the on-campus incidents in recent years that have involved nooses or the use of a racial slur.  In fact, experts who track hate crimes told PolitiFact that there isn’t even a nationwide data source that Prager could have used to pin down the number of incidents — real or fake — that specifically involved hanging a noose or scrawling the racist insult on college buildings or grounds.  The nationwide data that does exist flies in the face of Prager’s claim. ""In my 40 years of experience studying hate crimes, I would say the vast majority of instances where a noose was used to threaten or intimidate, it was displayed by white individuals,"" said Northeastern University’s Jack McDevitt, a professor of the practice in criminology and criminal justice and the author of two books on hate crimes. ""Mr. Prager is long on hyperbole and bigotry and short on facts,"" said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. ""Any look at available data shows that out of the officially reported hate crime allegations on college campuses, only a handful out of hundreds are provable false reports, and remember that colleges devote a significant amount of investigative resources to these reports."" The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program keeps tabs on hate crimes in the U.S., based on data submitted by law enforcement agencies. The most recent figures are from 2020. Of the 2,353 ""anti-Black or African American"" incidents where the offender’s race was known in 2020, 1,717 of them, or roughly 73%, were perpetrated by white people. By comparison, 90, or about 4%, were perpetrated by Black people. The breakdown was similar in 2019 and 2018. Not all law enforcement agencies record the offender’s race. At the Center for the Study of Hate Crimes and Extremism, Levin, a criminologist, produced a report in 2019 analyzing hate crimes that also looked at hate crime hoaxes.  Defining false hate crime reports as alleged incidents that were reported to authorities but later discovered to have been intentionally falsified, Levin’s team counted just 11 out of an estimated 7,600 hate crimes in 2018, amounting to 0.14%. ""I live these numbers,"" Levin said. What Prager claimed ""is a lie. It’s promoted again and again as a social construction of a hoax epidemic, when what we're actually having are increases in hate crime.""  Orlando Martinez, a detective and the coordinator for hate crimes with the Los Angeles Police Department, told the Washington Post in 2019 that he estimated five of the approximately 1,500 cases his team handled over the previous five years involved intentionally falsified reports. Martinez did not specify the race of the people involved in those false reports. Michael Jensen, a senior researcher at the University of Maryland’s National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, said his research examining the characteristics, motivations and behaviors of those who commit hate crimes also suggests that less than 1% of all hate crimes reported are hoaxes. Jensen said outsized media coverage can make hoax hate crimes appear more recurrent than they are, and that actual hate crime reports have been rising in spite of the fact that fewer and fewer police departments are reporting them to the FBI.  ""No serious scholar of hate crime believes that this spike is driven in any way by hoaxes,"" Jensen said. ""I am unaware of any serious data source that would support the conclusion that the majority of anti-Black hate crimes are hoaxes."" Many universities have not revealed the identities of students caught perpetrating legitimate hate crimes, often citing student privacy concerns. There have indeed been accounts of false hate crimes at colleges, and entire websites have been built to document such cases beyond college campuses. A Black cadet candidate at the Air Force Academy was revealed to be responsible for writing racial slurs in 2017 on message boards on students’ doors, including their own, for example. The Colorado Gazette reported the student committed the act ""in a bizarre bid to get out of trouble he faced at the school for other misconduct.""  College campuses are among the more common locations for such false reports to occur, Levin said. He attributed that to several possible factors, including diversity on many campuses, the seriousness with which school authorities typically regard reports of hate crimes, and the desire of some students to draw attention to an issue or themselves.  But there’s no evidence that the overwhelming majority of campus hate crimes — of which there were hundreds logged to the FBI and the Department of Education in recent years — are faked.  One scholar who has cataloged more fabricated hate crimes than other experts researching the subject is Wilfred Reilly, an assistant professor of political sciences at Kentucky State University. PolitiFact reached out to Reilly for this fact-check, but our questions went unanswered. In a book on hate crime hoaxes, Reilly culled together a dataset of more than 400 hate crime hoaxes between 2010 and 2017.  Other scholars, including Levin, have argued that Reilly’s tally is too broad. According to the Washington Post, Reilly counts some cases as hoaxes in which there was no offender at all, such as an alleged noose at a construction site that police determined was a rope for moving equipment. But the roughly 400 hoaxes that Reilly counted make up less than 1% of the roughly 50,000 hate crimes that were reported to the FBI in that timeframe.  And while Reilly has said he believes as much as 15% of hate crimes reports to the FBI could be falsified — based on the possibility that some allegations that don’t face heavy press scrutiny might never be revealed as false — that figure would also not provide evidence of what Prager said were ""overwhelming"" odds. Prager said that when there is ""a noose on a college dorm of a Black student"" or a racial slur ""on a dormitory building, the odds are overwhelming that a Black student actually did that."" Prager offered no evidence to support his claim; there isn’t even a data source that tracks on-campus hate crimes and hate crime hoaxes with that level of specificity, experts said. The more general data that is available on hate crimes in the U.S., however, suggests that Prager’s claim is far from the truth. The percentage of hate crime reports to the FBI that have turned out to be falsified is nowhere near ""overwhelming.""

Claim exaggerates fuel tax rates in Australia and Canada
","UPDATE: This fact-check replaces and expands on a previous fact-check that looked only at gas taxes in Canada. (Read an archived version of the previous check.) We decided to review the check after readers asked us about gas taxes in Australia, while other readers questioned our analysis about Canadian law. The previous check concluded the statement was False; we now rate the statement Mostly False. With record-high inflation rates around the world and gas prices still high, consumers’ wallets have been hit hard. But some social media posts have exaggerated the drain these high prices have had on people’s paychecks. An April 9 Facebook post claimed that most of a person’s income was being taxed by the government, rather than going toward goods or services. A similar post was shared by a different account on April 16. ""If you earn $100 and pay $33 income tax you’re left with $67. You then buy $67 worth of fuel and in doing so pay a 48% fuel tax (fuel tax = $32.16 + $6.70 GST). This means that the government just got $71.86 tax from your hard earned $100,"" the Facebook posts claimed. These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While the claims don’t explicitly say in which country this alleged 48% fuel tax exists, there is fine print at the bottom of the April 9 Facebook post that references Pauline Hanson, a right-wing populist politician in Australia who has advocated for a lower gas tax. The second Facebook post, shared on April 16, does not include this reference to Australia. The claims could also be about Canada, as the users who shared the both posts state on their Facebook profiles that they are based in that country. The mention of a goods and services tax indicates this claim is not about the United States, as it has no national sales tax. The Australian and Canadian governments do — and they also use a dollar sign for currency — so we looked at both countries to see if the claim holds water in either location. To be sure, the cost of crude oil, wholesale margins, retail margins and taxes all factor into the total price consumers pay at the pump. However, when it comes to both Australia and Canada, these claims misconstrue how much taxes account for the price consumers pay for gas. The claim also lacks context about income tax rates, no matter which of the two countries we consider. In Australia, income tax varies depending on how much a person makes. So, there are some Australians who are subject to a 33% income tax rate. Those earning between $45,001 and $120,000 pay $5,092 plus 33% of each $1 over $45,000 in income taxes. Individuals earning less than that pay a lower rate or no income tax at all, and people earning more pay a higher rate. (One Australian dollar is equal to about 72 cents in the U.S.) But Australian fuel taxes are lower than the 48% mentioned in the claim. Australia typically has a fuel excise tax of 44.2 cents per liter, but that rate was recently cut in half to help lower the cost of gas for consumers. The country also applies a 10% goods and services tax (GST) to gas purchases. If the GST is included in the total $67 gas purchase, then the tax would equal one-eleventh of the total purchase, or $6.09. That means the consumer spent $60.91 on gas before the GST was applied, according to the Australian government’s GST calculator. The average price of gas in Australia was $1.93 per liter on April 8. (There are roughly four liters in one gallon.) So with $60.91 a person could fill up their car with about 31 liters of fuel. (The typical car can hold between 45-65 liters of gas.) That 31 liters would normally be subject to a fuel excise tax of 44.2 cents per liter, or $13.70 in total. When combined with the GST, the total taxes would equal $19.79, or about 30% of a $67 gas purchase. But the current fuel excise rate is much lower. Starting March 30 until Sept. 28, the Australian government cut the fuel excise tax in half to 22.1 cents per liter. During this time, the amount of fuel taxes paid on a $60.91 gas purchase would be $6.85. Along with the GST, the consumer would pay a total of $12.94 in taxes, accounting for 19% of the purchase. In Canada, individuals earning less than $50,197 are subject to a 15% federal income tax. If a person makes more than that amount, they are subject to higher income tax rates depending on their amount of taxable income. Only individuals earning more than $221,708 are subject to a 33% income tax. (One Canadian dollar is equal to about 78 cents in the U.S.) All 13 provinces and territories in Canada also have their own income tax rates. None of these rates alone are as high as 33%, even for the highest earners. But depending on where a person lives and how much they make, the federal and provincial income tax rates may together equal 33% or more. However, similar to Australia, the claim that Canadians pay a 48% fuel tax is exaggerated. Gas purchases in Canada are subject to four types of taxes: a federal gas tax, a provincial gas tax, a carbon tax and a sales tax. The federal gas tax is fixed at 10 cents per liter. Provincial gas taxes range from 6.2 cents per liter to 27 cents per liter. The carbon tax ranges from 1.1 cents to 11.05 cents. (In certain parts of Canada, individuals are eligible to receive a quarterly climate action incentive tax benefit to help offset the cost of federal pollution pricing.) The sales tax applied after these fuel taxes varies depending on where a person lives in Canada. Seven provinces and territories pay the federal GST of 5% on gas purchases, while the other six pay a higher harmonized sales tax (HST), which combines the federal GST with the provincial sales tax (PST). Drivers in Vancouver — compared to other cities and provinces in Canada — pay the most total taxes on gas purchases. Vancouver is one of three cities in Canada that adds a municipal tax on gasoline. Vancouver is in British Columbia, which applies the federal GST of 5% to gas purchases. For a total purchase of $67, the GST would equal $2.99. That means the consumer spent $64.01 on gas before the GST was applied, according to the Canadian government’s GST calculator. The average price of gas in Canada was $1.90 per liter on April 4. So with $64.01 a person in Vancouver could buy about 33 liters of gas. That 33 liters would be subject to a 10-cent per liter federal gas tax, a 27-cent provincial gas tax and an 11.05-cent carbon tax, totaling $15.86. After adding the GST, the total taxes paid to the Canadian government would be $18.85, or 28% of the $67 gas purchase. People living in other parts of the country, where the tax rates are lower, would pay less in taxes. Some parts of Canada are lowering certain gas taxes to give consumers a break while the price of oil is high. For example, last month Alberta dropped its provincial fuel tax of 13 cents per liter while the price of U.S. crude oil remains above $90 a barrel. Starting July 1, Ontario will reduce its provincial gas tax by 5.7 cents, so the rate through the end of the year will be 9 cents per liter. Two recent Facebook posts claimed: ""If you earn $100 and pay $33 income tax you’re left with $67. You then buy $67 worth of fuel and in doing so pay a 48% fuel tax (fuel tax = $32.16 + $6.70 GST). This means that the government just got $71.86 tax from your hard earned $100."" Since the Facebook posts did not include how much money this hypothetical person makes a year, it’s not possible to determine their income tax rate in Australia or Canada. Also, neither country has a 48% fuel tax. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2022/may/06/facebook-posts/claim-exaggerates-fuel-tax-rates-australia-and-can/

Does New York lead the nation in population loss?
","Lee Zeldin, a Republican U.S. House member who is running for governor of New York, criticized longstanding Democratic control of state government in an April 12 tweet. Poor quality of life in the Empire state, Zeldin charged, has led the state’s population to decline. ""New York leads the U.S. in population loss, because residents aren’t feeling safe on the streets and subways, they feel suffocated by heavy-handed government action, it doesn’t make sense economically to remain here, and opportunity for a better life is presenting itself elsewhere,"" Zeldin tweeted. New York leads the US in population loss, because residents aren’t feeling safe on the streets and subways, they feel suffocated by heavy handed government action, it doesn’t make sense economically to remain here, and opportunity for a better life is presenting itself elsewhere.

Data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that New York did lead the states in lost population between July 2020 and July 2021, although the losses were not as steep between the full decennial censuses of 2010 and 2020. When we contacted Zeldin’s office, a spokesperson cited an article from December 2021 in the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle that summarized newly released Census data.  According to data released by the bureau in December 2021, New York dropped below 20 million people between July 2020 and July 2021, decreasing from 20.15 million to 19.84 million. That’s a decline of 1.58%, which was the largest percentage loss for any state during that period. (New York also had the largest loss in raw numbers — 319,000 — although statisticians usually prefer to compare states by percentage losses, because some states, like New York, are much larger to start with.) Sixteen other states lost population during that yearlong period. The states with losses closest to New York were Illinois, with a decline of 0.89%; Hawaii, with a decline of 0.71%; California, with a decline of 0.66%; and Louisiana, with a decline of 0.58%. An analysis by the Pew Charitable Trusts, an independent think tank, found that New York’s losses were ""primarily because many residents left New York for other states."" An analysis by the New York-focused Empire Center, another think tank, said the scale of departures during this period ""shattered all out-migration records, exceeding New York’s record annual migration losses during the late 1970s."" An additional factor was a decline in immigration from outside the United States, due in part to travel controls during the coronavirus pandemic. Net foreign immigration to New York decreased during the one-year period to just 18,860 people, which the Empire Center said was the smallest number in at least 60 years. The coronavirus pandemic also increased the number of deaths in New York, although there were enough births in the state to exceed deaths of all causes by 18,503. The data showing the change in population between July 2020 and July 2021 is based on estimates rather than the full-scale census count that is conducted every 10 years. And the data on population change between the last two censuses, 2010 and 2020, show that New York was not quite so cursed on the population front over that longer period. On average during that decade, New York’s population grew by 0.42% per year, rather than shrinking. That was a bit below the 50-state median; New York had the 32nd fastest growth rate during that period. Only three states lost population during that decade: Illinois, Mississippi and West Virginia.  Zeldin tweeted, ""New York leads the U.S. in population loss.""  He’s right on the numbers. Census data shows that New York’s population declined by 1.58% between July 2020 and July 2021, the latest population estimate available. That was the largest percentage loss of any state during that period. We rate the statement True.",/factchecks/2022/may/06/lee-zeldin/does-new-york-lead-nation-population-loss/

Contrary to claim, rape never mentioned in Roe v. Wade proceedings and did not form basis of case
","With Roe v. Wade back in the headlines, a previously debunked claim that the landmark case hinged on a lie is again being shared on social media timelines. ""Roe v. Wade happened because a woman lied about being raped by black men,"" says a May 3 post on Facebook. It also says ""Where’s BLM?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But the Supreme Court did not consider the circumstances of the plaintiff’s pregnancy when ruling on the case. The plaintiff was identified during the proceedings by the pseudonym Jane Roe and later publicly revealed her real name, Norma McCorvey. ""The U.S. Supreme Court did not consider how ‘Jane Roe’ became pregnant when making its landmark decision in 1973,"" the Associated Press reported in 2019. And McCorvey’s lawyers ""never mentioned an alleged rape in court, and it formed no part of their legal argument,"" Vanity Fair wrote in 2013. The 66-page ruling from the Supreme Court does not mention Roe’s claim of rape. When describing Roe, the ruling says she ""alleged that she was unmarried and pregnant; that she wished to terminate her pregnancy by an abortion ‘performed by a competent, licensed physician, under safe, clinical conditions;’ that she was unable to get a ‘legal’ abortion in Texas because her life did not appear to be threatened by the continuation of her pregnancy; and that she could not afford to travel to another jurisdiction in order to secure a legal abortion under safe conditions."" McCorvey initially told reporters she had been raped but admitted in a 1987 interview that she ""fabricat(ed) the rape as she sought an abortion in 1969 because she believed it would help her get access to the procedure,"" The Associated Press reported.  ""Abortion was illegal in Texas then, except to save a woman’s life. She continued to tell the untrue story as her case attracted national attention."" Accounts of McCorvey’s story in mainstream, credible publications do not mention the race of the alleged attacker. When McCorvey revealed in 1987 that she had not been raped, The New York Times reported at that time, ""The assertion of rape was not a factor in the Supreme Court's ruling."" The AP also noted in 2019 that ""the Supreme Court has not weighed in on restricting or legalizing abortions based on why a woman seeks the procedure."" After the post was shared on Facebook, it was tagged with a 2018 fact check, indicating that it contained false information. The person who shared the post on Facebook commented, ""This is not false information. Her story about being raped led to the case. Facebook fact checkers are flat-out lying. This is disgusting."" But the rape allegation did not lead to the court case; McCorvey’s desire to terminate the pregnancy is what led to the legal proceedings. As the AP reported this week about Roe v. Wade, ""The question before the U.S. Supreme Court was: Does the Constitution recognize a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy by abortion?"" A Facebook post says, ""Roe v. Wade happened because a woman lied about being raped by black men."" But the allegation of rape was not taken into consideration during the case. The Supreme Court did not consider the circumstances of the plaintiff’s pregnancy, and the court’s ruling does not mention Roe’s claim of rape. McCorvey’s lawyers did not mention the alleged rape in court and did not include it in their legal argument. McCorvey’s desire to terminate the pregnancy — not her allegation of rape — is what led to the Roe v. Wade legal proceedings. We rate this claim False.   ",/factchecks/2022/may/06/facebook-posts/contrary-claim-rape-never-mentioned-roe-v-wade-pro/

Fact-checking claims about Danish preprint study on COVID-19 vaccines and mortality
","A Danish study that evaluated how the COVID-19 vaccines impact mortality is being used online as evidence that the messenger RNA-based vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna offer ""no mortality benefit"" at all.  ""mRNA Vaccines Show No Mortality Benefit - Danish Study"" is the title of a YouTube video that says the April 5 study found that the mRNA shots from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna do not stop infections or transmission and don’t reduce deaths, thus showing ""no discernible mortality benefit."" The video adds that, by contrast, the adenovirus vector vaccines from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca do show a ""very positive mortality benefit from COVID and, intriguingly, even from non-COVID deaths."" The video features Chris Martenson, a former pharmaceutical financial analyst and founder of Peak Prosperity, a website that appears to be devoted to sharing concepts from a book he authored. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) PolitiFact reached out to Peak Prosperity for comment but did not hear back. The study, titled ""Randomised Clinical Trials of COVID-19 Vaccines: Do Adenovirus-Vector Vaccines Have Beneficial Non-Specific Effects?"" was posted April 5 in the Lancet journal’s preprint server. A ""preprint"" is a research paper before it is peer-reviewed or accepted for publication by a scholarly or scientific journal. The study was conducted by researchers affiliated with various institutions, including the University of Southern Denmark, the Statens Serums Institut and the Bandim Health Project.  The research analyzed randomized controlled trials to see how much the COVID-19 vaccines reduced deaths from all causes, and it sought to compare how the results differed between the adenovirus-vector vaccines and mRNA-based vaccines.  For the mRNA vaccines, the study found that 61 people out of 74,193 participants died. Thirty-one received the vaccine, while 30 received a placebo, thus showing that the vaccine essentially had no impact on ""overall"" mortality, according to the study. For the adenovirus-vector vaccines, the study recorded 46 deaths out of 122,164 participants. Of the 46, 16 had received the vaccine, while 30 received a placebo.  The authors concluded that the two types of vaccines differed significantly ""with respect to overall mortality."" They also said that adenovirus vaccines were associated with protection against non-accident, non-COVID-19 deaths. But when looking at COVID-19 mortality rates specifically, the picture changes.  The study found that of the 31 deaths that occured in mRNA-vaccinated individuals, only two were from COVID-19. The rest were due to other causes. For the adenovirus-vaccinated group, two of the 16 deaths were from COVID-19. One of the study’s lead authors, Dr. Christine Stabell Benn, a professor of global health at the University of Southern Denmark, made a post about the findings on her LinkedIn page. She argued that scientists cannot presume to know the full effect of a vaccine ""just by knowing its effect against the target infection"" and said scientists need to study its effect on overall health. ""We need to be clear about which vaccine, and what outcomes, we are talking about,"" Benn wrote. ""The analysis of the randomized clinical trials suggests that COVID-19 vaccines are not a homogeneous group. Hence, we (health authorities, medical doctors, politicians, media as well as citizens) need to distinguish between ‘mRNA COVID-19 vaccines’ and ‘adenovirus vector COVID-19 vaccines’, and we need to specify if we talk about COVID-19-specific mortality or all-cause mortality."" She wrote that headlines that say COVID-19 vaccines reduce mortality are too simplified.  But the same argument can be said for the YouTube video’s title — that mRNA vaccines offer ""no mortality benefit."" It’s misleading because it doesn’t specify that the findings are about non-COVID-19 related deaths, that the study is a preprint, or that more research is needed. While scientists like Benn contend that it’s important to study overall mortality effects of vaccines, people received these shots to protect themselves against COVID-19, which these vaccines continue to do.  ""The study isn’t about the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against COVID,"" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health and Security. ""The study is aimed to determine if COVID vaccines have non-specific mortality impacts that extend beyond the incontrovertible mortality benefit they confer with COVID-19. Certain vaccines have effects that extend beyond the target infection and decrease mortality from other causes (e.g. measles vaccine)."" Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, also said the question of the paper isn’t about COVID-19, but whether the vaccines had a beneficial effect on other causes of mortality. The research reinforced that both types of vaccines significantly prevented COVID-19 deaths, ""which is not surprising as both types of vaccines generate cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2, protecting us against severe disease."" The study’s results showing a stronger association between improved mortality and the adenoviral-vector vaccines could suggest these vaccines have other beneficial effects, Ghandi said. But, again, that does not mean there is no mortality benefit to the mRNA vaccine. ""However, to be fair,"" Gandhi said, ""the number of non-COVID and COVID deaths were rare in all of the pooled analyses and the causes of non-COVID deaths not well adjudicated, so this analysis needs to be taken as preliminary and hypothesis generating at best."" The authors acknowledged that the study was based on limited available data over a shorter than desired timeframe. In an email to PolitiFact, Benn said she feels the lack of data documenting whether the vaccines reduce deaths from causes other than COVID-19 is an area in need of additional research and suggested such data can give a fuller picture of overall vaccine safety.  Meanwhile, in an emailed statement, Pfizer said that numerous peer-reviewed studies around the world have confirmed the safety and efficacy of its COVID-19 vaccine. ""With hundreds of millions of doses administered globally, the benefit risk profile of our vaccine remains positive for all approved indications and age groups and we remain confident in the protection and safety our COVID-19 vaccine provides,"" the statement read.  A video circulating on social media claims that a Danish study found that mRNA vaccines offer ""no mortality benefit."" This is an oversimplification that doesn’t accurately reflect the preprint study, which was not peer reviewed. Researchers used clinical trial data to see how the different COVID-19 vaccines reduced deaths from all causes. They found that adenovirus-vector vaccines appeared to protect against non-accident, non-COVID-19 deaths, while mRNA vaccines didn’t have much of an impact. They said more research is needed.  The research didn’t conclude that mRNA vaccines were ineffective at protecting people from dying of COVID-19.  We rate this False. ",/factchecks/2022/may/06/youtube-videos/fact-checking-claims-about-danish-preprint-study-c/
