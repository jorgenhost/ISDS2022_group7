Ad claims Newt Gingrich favored federal funding for some abortions
","
A pro-Mitt Romney super PAC is keeping up its attacks on Newt Gingrich with just before the Iowa caucuses.

An ad posted to YouTube on Dec. 20, 2011, asks, ""Know what makes Barack Obama happy? Newt Gingrich’s baggage.""

Suitcases adorned with Gingrich campaign stickers slide down an airport baggage carousel as a female voice launches into a list of attacks on the former House speaker’s record.

Here, we’re checking this one: ""As speaker, Gingrich even supported taxpayer funding of some abortions."" 
What we found is a case of cherry-picking his words to paint him as supporting abortion rights, which he clearly does not.

The ad and what’s behind it

Airing in Florida and Iowa, the ad is paid for by a political action committee, which isn’t formally tied to any candidate or campaign but can spend money influencing elections. The one behind this ad is known as Restore our Future and is staffed and funded by supporters of Mitt Romney.

For reference, the ad cites NewtFacts.com, where a list of supporting material for its claims is displayed. On the abortion charge, NewtFacts.com quotes news stories from April 1995, when Gingrich appeared on the CBS show Face the Nation. He had just completed his first 100 days as speaker and was talking about his next priorities, particularly regarding social issues.

""What about the abortion issue?"" asked Gloria Borger, then of U.S. News and World Report. ""There are people in your Republican conference and Republican presidential candidates who believe that there should be no federal funding at all, even in the cases of rape or incest. Do you agree with that?""

""No,"" Gingrich responded. ""First of all, I think you should have funding in the case of rape or incest or life of the mother, which is the first step.""

Gingrich was taking the position of many moderates, who believe abortion should be allowed only when a woman is raped or impregnated through incest, or if carrying the pregnancy to term threatens her life. He went a step further in saying federal money, such as through Medicaid, should be allowed to pay for such abortions.

What else?

So Restore our Future is right about what Gingrich said on Face the Nation. But we also wanted to look at his overall legislative record on taxpayer-funded abortion.

We contacted NARAL Pro-Choice America, a group that advocates for abortion rights and considers Gingrich anti-choice.

NARAL researchers found that Gingrich voted for an amendment to the 1984 Labor-Health and Human Services Appropriations bill that would have prohibited Medicaid funding for abortion care in all cases.

More recently, he voted repeatedly to prohibit the District of Columbia from using public funds to provide abortions for low-income women, NARAL said, and he supported rules that barred abortion coverage from health care plans for federal employees.

In 1993, he voted for the Hyde Amendment, an attachment to the annual federal spending bill first introduced in 1976 by Illinois Rep. Henry Hyde and employed each year since. Although its language changes from year to year, the amendment generally (including in 1993) bans the use of public funds for abortions except in cases of rape and incest and when the woman’s life is in danger.

The Hyde Amendment is widely considered a legislative achievement by groups that oppose abortion rights because it keeps taxpayer money from being spent on most abortions. The National Right to Life Committee, a prominent antiabortion group, lists it as one of the tests for where candidates stand on protecting life. In its presidential candidate scorecard, Gingrich is noted as having voted for the amendment.

Gingrich’s own website, Newt.org, devotes a section to ""setting the record straight"" on his record, citing a 98.6 percent Lifetime Pro-Life Rating from the National Right to Life Committee. (We reached out to the Right to Life Committee but did not hear back.)

He has signed the Susan B. Anthony List Pro-Life Leadership Presidential Pledge, in which candidates promise to ""permanently end all taxpayer funding of abortion in all domestic and international spending programs.""

Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond recently told the Des Moines Register  that Gingrich remains opposed to abortion with the exception of cases of rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. But he has changed his position on using taxpayer money and now opposes funding abortion no matter what the circumstances.

Our ruling

Restore Our Future’s ad said that ""as speaker, Gingrich even supported taxpayer funding of some abortions.""

His remarks on Face the Nation in 1995, when he said ""I think you should have funding in the case of rape or incest or life of the mother,"" align with that statement. While he was serving in Congress, he voted for the Hyde Amendment, which bans public funding of abortions except under those three circumstances. That’s a position widely embraced by those who want to restrict abortion. The ad implicitly portrays Gingrich as opposing those interests. While its wording is accurate, its message is misleading.

"['Marriage', 'Texas', 'Gail  Collins']","
Columnist Gail Collins says Ron Paul doesn't believe in marriage licenses
","New York Times op-ed columnist Gail Collins zinged presidential aspirant Ron Paul in a recent piece. Saying everyone agrees the Texas congressman has a great organization in Iowa, where voters caucus in January, Collins said that’s important, ""particularly for a Republican candidate who doesn’t believe in marriage licenses, the war on drugs, the war in Afghanistan or prosecuting flag burners.""

For this article, we evaluated her first claim — that Paul, who wedded his wife, Carol, in 1957, does not believe in marriage licenses.

Collins’ aide, Isabella Moschen, told us by email that Collins reached that conclusion based on a 2011 collection of Paul writings, ""Liberty Defined."" Separately, Paul campaign spokesman Gary Howard advised: ""You should read the book.""

We focused on Paul’s chapter in the book titled ""Marriage."" In it, Paul writes that most Americans ""do not question the requirement to obtain a license to get married."" But ideally, he says, each individual could define marriage as he or she pleases, so long as force is not used to impose the definition on others. It’s a matter of free speech, he says, in keeping with the First Amendment.

This week, Paul said he favors leaving regulations involving marriage up to the states, according to a Dec. 21, 2011, news article posted by The Boston Globe.

According to the newspaper, Paul said at a New Hampshire stop: ""Why should the government be telling you what marriage is all about? You might have one definition. I have another definition."" Speaking later to reporters, Paul said: ""My personal opinion is government shouldn’t be involved. The whole country would be better off if individuals made those decisions and it was a private matter,"" the Globe reported.

In his book, Paul also points out that some states recognize couples as married without requiring that they get a license.

A ""common law"" marriage is generally defined by Black’s Law Dictionary as a non-ceremonial relationship that requires ""a positive mutual agreement, permanent and exclusive of all others, to enter into a marriage relationship, cohabitation sufficient to warrant a fulfillment of necessary relationship of man and wife, and an assumption of marital duties and obligations.""

We spotted this definition in an April 2011 web post by the National Conference of State Legislatures that also says nine states (Alabama, Colorado, Kansas, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Iowa, Montana, Oklahoma and Texas) recognize all common-law marriages and five states (Georgia, Idaho, Ohio, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania) recognize common-law marriages that were established before a certain date.

In Texas, according to information posted online by the Texas Department of State Health Services, a couple may register their ""informal marriage"" by appearing together before a county clerk to file such a declaration. Alternatively, a couple can establish their common-law marriage by showing they agree they are married, that they live together in the state and that they represent themselves to others that they are married to each other, the post says.

Paul refers to the licensing mandate in another part of the marriage chapter, saying: ""The best approach is to make marriage a private matter. When we no longer believe that civilization is dependent on government expansion, regulating excesses, and a license for everything we do, we will know that civilization and the ideas of liberty are advancing.""

""Licensing for social reasons reflects the intolerant person’s desire to mold other people’s behavior to their standard,"" Paul writes. ""Both depend on the use of illegitimate government force.""

U.S. Senate candidate Barry Hinckley says the nation's tax code is 80,000 pages
","
Every year brings another report that the United State's tax code has become so complicated that even the people who work for the Internal Revenue Service don't know what's in it. Part of the reason may be its size.

Republican Barry Hinckley, who is running against incumbent Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse, offered a sense of the scope of the code during a Dec. 4 appearance on the WPRI program ""Newsmakers.""

When Rhode Island Public Radio political reporter Ian Donnis asked about the refusal of most Republicans to consider any tax increase, Hinckley said, ""Our tax code is desperately broken. It's 80,000 pages. So in my opinion, any effort to continue to tweak something that's broken is a fool's errand to begin with. So trying to raise more money through a busted tax code, I think, is the wrong way to go.""

Hinckley repeated the 80,000-page claim a few minutes later. It also shows up in a Warwick Beacon story on the candidate.

Is the tax code really that long?

A lot of estimates can be found on the Internet, ranging from a few thousand pages to more than a million, if you believe the claims of one blogger.

But as any student knows who has tried to lengthen a sparse book report by writing with big letters, the number of pages isn't the best gauge. It's the number of words.

We went to The Tax Foundation, a pro-business Washington-based research organization that regularly examines the tax burden. They directed us to a report from the Taxpayer Advocate's Service (TAS), an independent organization within the Internal Revenue Service.

The service took the Feb. 1, 2010, version of the tax code, written by Congress and formally known as Title 26, copied it into Microsoft Word, and used the ""word count"" feature to discover that it had 3.8 million words. (The actual length is a bit less because this count includes cross references, captions and descriptions of amendments that don't have the force of law.)

So we did the math -- 3.8 million words spread over 80,000 pages would be 48 words per page. That's either really big print or a huge waste of paper. (For a sense of scale, this paragraph contains exactly 48 words and would fill one of those hypothetical pages.)

The 3.8 million words produced 11,045 single-spaced pages in Word, which makes Hinckley's estimate more than seven times too high.

And if the code were published in a reference book, that would allow for smaller type and more words per page. The government doesn't publish just the code so we went to CCH, a company that specializes in tax law research. Its tax code book, published a year ago, runs 5,368 pages, according to the version we found on Amazon.com.

Even that number is too high. CCH spokeswoman Leslie Bonacum said if you strip out indexes and other material that is not part of the code itself. That ""leaves us with 5,084 pages of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, along with amendment notes (written by CCH staff) that details all legislative changes to the code and their effective dates.""

We wondered if the IRS rules and regulations might increase the total to 80,000 pages.

No such luck.

CCH's printed copy of the rules and regs, covering six volumes, is listed at 13,880 pages. So the code and regulations combined is fewer than 20,000 pages. (By extrapolation, if you downloaded both and printed them with Word, as the TAS did, it would run to about 40,000 pages, still half of what Hinckley says.)

So where did Hinckley get the 80,000-page figure?

His spokeswoman sent us links to a Fox Business article and a commentary on a New Jersey website. We found plenty of other references that also used the 80,000-page figure. They simply state it as fact.

One source of confusion may be CCH itself.

The Hinckley spokeswoman directed us to a colorful chart by CCH that shows how the number of pages in one of its publications, ""CCH Standard Federal Tax Reporter,"" has increased over the years. Its 2011 edition has 72,536 pages.

But that publication isn't just the tax code. ""That includes the code, regs, annotations to court cases, revenue rulings, explanatory material, other things that come out of the IRS that are not regulations,"" said Mark Luscombe, principal analyst for the tax and accounting group at CCH. ""But some politicians and media have picked that up and called it the code, which is not correct.""

For example, the website Political Calculations miscalculates by taking the CCH chart and incorrectly presenting it as the number of pages in the tax code itself.

That's akin to including everything the Vatican has written about Scripture and using it to claim that the Bible itself (about 1,100 pages) is hundreds of millions of pages long.

Our ruling

Unlike the U.S. tax code, we'll be brief.

Republican U.S. Senate candidate Barry Hinckley said the code is 80,000 pages long, an assertion he made twice on ""Newsmakers"" and his spokeswoman defends by citing some Internet sources.

In reality, it's about 11,000 pages on Microsoft Word and less than half that size in book form. Adding in the IRS's rules and regulations still doesn't bring it close to the length Hinckley says. Only when you include all types of ancillary materials does it begin to approach that legendary length.

If Hinckley, whose campaign informed us in an email that the code was 3.7 million words in 2009, had done the math, they would have realized that the code couldn't cover that many pages unless you put fewer than 48 words per page. A few minutes searching Amazon.com would also have uncovered real books -- and page counts -- that were more accurate.

The U.S. tax code may be ridiculously long, maddeningly convoluted and overly complex, but Hinckley's count is way off the mark. We rule his claim False.

George Allen claims he was one of a dozen senators to vote against the 'Bridge to Nowhere'
","
Republican Senate candidate George Allen says he gave a thumbs down to a project that became a symbol of federal waste.

""I was one of about a dozen (senators) who voted against the Bridge to Nowhere,"" Allen said in a Dec. 7 debate with Tim Kaine, his expected Democratic rival for the senate seat.

Allen, who served in the senate from 2001-2007, was referring to a federal plan to build a $225 million bridge connecting the city of Ketchikan, Alaska, with the Island of Gravina, which has 50 residents. The plan became a lightning rod for critics who said congressional earmarking -- the set aside of federal money for pet projects -- had run amok.

Funding for the bridge was included in a $286.5 billion highway and transportation bill in 2005. The Senate passed the legislation on July 29, 2005, by a vote of 91-4.

Jamie Radtke, who is challenging Allen for the GOP nomination for the Senate seat, has charged that Allen supported the bridge because he voted for the omnibus highway bill. We’re dismissive of the charge, because funding for the Alaska bridge came to less than one-tenth of one percent of the expenses in the bill.

PolitiFact examined a similar charge that President Barack Obama supported the Bridge to Nowhere because, like Allen, he voted in favor of the overall highway bill that contained the bridge funding. The claim  -- made by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, was rated Mostly False.

But how does Allen justify his assertion that he actually voted against the bridge?

Dan Allen, a senior advisor to the Allen campaign, cited the former senator’s vote on an amendment in a later transportation appropriations bill that called for stripping federal funding from the Bridge to Nowhere project.

That amendment, sponsored by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, sought to redirect part of the funding for the Ketchikan-Gravina Island bridge funding to a project to rebuild the Twin Spans Bridge between New Orleans and Slidell, La., which had been damaged during Hurricane Katrina.

That amendment failed by a vote of 82-15. Allen was indeed one of the 15 senators who voted in favor of killing the funding for the Bridge to Nowhere.

Steve Ellis, the vice president of the Taxpayers for Common Sense, said considering Allen’s vote on the amendment, Allen’s statement is accurate.

""It rings pretty true,"" Ellis said.

After the amendment’s defeat, lawmakers hashing out differences between the House and Senate measure of the appropriations bill removed the earmark for the Bridge project and instead provided the money directly to the Alaska Department of Transportation to spend on whatever projects it saw fit. That funding still could have gone to Ketchikan-Gravina Island span, but ultimately the bridge was never built.

Our Ruling

Allen said he was one of  a dozen senators who voted against the Bridge to Nowhere.

When faced with a specific amendment to defund the bridge, Allen was one of a minority of senators who opted to kill the project.

We rate his claim True.

Obama’s former “girlfriends” sought by conspiracy theorists in chain e-mail
","
The conspiracy theorists out there want to know where President Barack Obama’s former girlfriends are.

A chain e-mail circulating in New Jersey raises that question and others about the allegedly murky past of the man sitting in the Oval Office. Americans know ""every little tidbit about every other president,"" but Obama’s past remains a mystery, according to the e-mail.

""Ever wonder why no one ever came forward from Obama's past, saying they knew him, attended school with him, was his friend, etc.?"" the e-mail states. ""Not one person has ever come forward from his past.""

It’s amazing this e-mail was even sent over the Internet, because PolitiFact New Jersey found that it only takes a few Google searches to realize how ridiculous the claim is.

In books and various other media accounts, friends and former classmates have provided memories of the future president, from body surfing in California and cooking in a New York City apartment to running the Harvard Law Review.

Our PolitiFact colleagues gave a Pants on Fire to a similar claim from Donald Trump, who said Obama’s former classmates ""never saw him"" and ""don’t know who he is."" In that ruling, PolitiFact outlined different news articles with people remembering Obama.

So, let’s review some of what PolitiFact New Jersey found:

Obama began his higher education in 1979 at Occidental College, a small liberal arts college in Los Angeles. In a video interview with The Gazette in Colorado, Barbara Thummalapally recalled how she and her husband became friends with Obama at Occidental.

After partying until about 4 a.m. one weekend, Thummalapally said, ""Barack says, ‘Oh, I got to go to my room, and they’re like, ‘Why are you leaving now?’ He said, ‘Well, I’ve got a paper to write.’""

One of Obama’s freshman roommates at Occidental, Paul Carpenter, also ""recalled Obama as ‘a good bodysurfer’ who had ‘a funky red car, a Fiat’ and who also played intramurals — flag football, tennis and water polo,"" according to a May 2008 Associated Press story.

In 1981, Obama transferred to Columbia University and shared an apartment with Phil Boerner. In a 2009 column in Columbia College Today, Boerner wrote about living with Obama and spending time with him in New York City.

Regarding their apartment’s irregular heat, Boerner wrote: ""When the heat wasn’t on, we sometimes sat with sleeping bags or blankets wrapped around ourselves and read our school books. We also didn’t have regular hot water and sometimes used the Columbia gym for showers.""

Sohale Siddiqi, who also shared an apartment with Obama during his time in the city, recalled how women thought Obama was a ""hunk,"" according to that Associated Press story.

""You know how it is. You go to a bar and you try hitting on the girls,"" Siddiqi told the Associated Press. ""He had a lot more success. I wouldn't outcompete him in picking up girls, that's for sure.""

More recollections can be found from Obama’s years at Harvard Law School between 1988 and 1991, where he would meet several individuals who later joined his transition team.

Harvard classmate Cassandra Butts, who served as the team’s general counsel, spoke of Obama’s Harvard experience in a 2008 interview on the PBS show Frontline:

""He was very mature, and he was very directed. He knew what he wanted to do: get his law degree and learn as much as he possibly could and take that experience back to Chicago and work in the same communities that he had worked as an organizer.""

Our ruling

A chain e-mail making the rounds in New Jersey claims ""no one ever came forward from Obama’s past, saying they knew him, attended school with him, was his friend.""

As various news accounts indicate, this claim is bogus. Friends and former classmates have participated in numerous interviews, telling tales of Obama’s years leading up to his run for the White House.

That’s why this chain e-mail deserves just three words: Pants on Fire!

Anti-abortion activist says murder is the No. 1 killer of pregnant women
","
Via Twitter, the president of the anti-abortion Texans for Life Coalition made this claim Dec. 6, 2011: ""Murder #1 cause of death for pg women,"" meaning pregnant women. ""Tragic.""

Kyleen Wright’s message pointed Twitter followers to a Houston Chronicle news article published that day about a Houston man charged with capital murder in the August 2010 stabbing death of a pregnant woman. Investigators had discovered records of calls and text messages between the man and the woman, the story says, indicating that he thought he was the unborn child's father and wanted her to have an abortion but that she had refused.

We asked Wright to elaborate on murder being the primary cause of death for pregnant women. By email, she replied: ""This is a story that keeps popping up. ... It’s the top cause, it’s one of the top causes, and then there will be the occasional story denying it’s a top cause.""

Wright guided us to an Oct. 26, 2011, Reuters news article about a study concluding that about three of every 100,000 women who are pregnant or have a child less than 1 year old are murdered and two of every 100,000 kill themselves, with roughly half of the women who died violently having had some sort of conflict with current or former partners. That facet, the story says, prompted experts to call for more thorough screening and follow-up for domestic problems during pregnancy check-ups.

In the November 2011, issue of the Obstetrics & Gynecology medical journal, the researchers summed up: ""Pregnancy-associated homicide and suicide each account for more deaths"" than obstetric complications ""including hemorrhage, obstetric embolism or preeclampsia and eclampsia.""

That’s not quite saying murder is the prime killer of pregnant women. Rather, the study suggests that homicide accounts for more deaths than specific individual complications of pregnancy.

The study says the researchers determined that there were two suicides and 2.9 homicides among pregnant or postpartum mothers for every 100,000 live births from 2003 through 2007.

Over the years, the study says, rates of death due to cardiac disease, infection and hemorrhage and other such medical causes have decreased but maternal mortality due to injury has remained constant. ""Homicide and suicide are two important and potentially preventable causes of maternal injury,"" the study says.

In an interview, the study’s lead researcher, Christie Palladino, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Georgia Health Sciences University, pointed us to a 2010 study led by Cynthia Berg of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimating that from 1998 through 2005, the U.S. death rate of women from all pregnancy-related complications was 14.5 per 100,000 live births. The study was described in the December 2010 issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology.

Palladino told us that her study’s figures on slain pregnant and postpartum women were drawn from the National Violent Death Reporting System, a federal database including all records of violent deaths in 16 participating states.

She noted that compared to the 2.9 homicides of pregnant and postpartum women per 100,000 live births, other research has found that 1.81 pregnant and postpartum women per 100,0000 live births die from hemorrhage, with fewer pregnant women dying from other causes associated with pregnancy, including cardiovascular conditions, thrombotic pulmonary embolisms, hypertensive disorders, infections, cardiomyopathy and amniotic fluid embolisms.

Then again, Palladino said, her team’s study did not look into all possible causes of death for pregnant women; car wrecks, for example, were not included. By email, Palladino said that ""while we can't say that homicide is THE #1 cause (of) pregnancy-associated mortality, our data when compared to other data on maternal mortality"" points to the fact that homicide and suicide are ""among the leading causes of pregnancy-associated deaths.""

Palladino also provided a federal study, published in 2005, concluding that the murder rate for pregnant and postpartum women was 1.7 per 100,000 live births.

Murder risk factors for mothers, the federal study says, include being younger than 20, being African American and having late or no prenatal care. ""Homicide,"" the authors wrote in the March 2005 issue of the American Journal of Public Health, ""is a leading cause of pregnancy-associated injury deaths.""

But it’s not the leading cause, according to the 2005 study.

The study drew on information covering 1991 through 1999 in the nation’s Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System, which was established in 1987 to collect data on all reported deaths that occurred during pregnancy or within a year of pregnancy.

And of all the period’s 7,342 reported deaths of women (some of which occurred more than a year after the woman gave birth), 4,200 were due to medical complications during pregnancy or a year afterward. Nearly 880 of the deaths occurred due to motor vehicle accidents and 617 women were murdered, the study says, and unintentional injuries, suicides and other causes accounted for nearly 500 deaths.

In this review, then, murder trailed vehicle accidents and medical complications as a cause of death.
Additional perspective may be in order, the researchers indicated, in that the prevalence of homicides involving pregnant and postpartum women is ""similar to national statistics on homicide among all women of reproductive age (regardless of whether they are pregnant or not).""

In 1999, the study says, homicide was the third-leading cause of injury-related death for all U.S. women (pregnant or not pregnant) of reproductive age, 15 to 44 years of age, after deaths caused by motor vehicle accidents and suicide. For such women in 2008, the latest year of available data, homicide ranked behind motor vehicle accidents, poisonings, malignant tumors, suicides, poisonings and heart disease among causes of death, our check of a CDC database indicates.

We’re ready to rule.

The Palladino study, suggesting more pregnant and postpartum women die from murder than any single medical complication, gives Wright’s claim an element of truth. But murder trails medical complications combined as a cause of death and it’s also behind vehicle wrecks. Wright’s statement is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/dec/26/kyleen-wright/anti-abortion-activist-says-murder-no-1-killer-pre/

Cory Booker says U.S. spends more than 17 percent of gross domestic product on health care costs
","
If the United States wants a robust economy, Newark Mayor Cory Booker said the country needs to rein in its spending on health care.

During a recent stump in New Hampshire for President Barack Obama, Booker, a Democrat, said he’s proud that there are leaders in the U.S. making progress, but said the health care law Obama signed wasn’t ""perfect."" He claimed the U.S. has a major problem: it spends more on health care as a percentage of gross domestic product, the total value of all goods and services produced within a nation, then its closest competitors.

""I'm the first person to tell you that health care legislation wasn't perfect -- wasn't perfect -- and that we have a severe problem. America cannot spend … over 17 percent of its GDP on health care costs when our closest competitor nations are spending about 12,"" Booker said during a Dec. 9 speech in Manchester, N.H. ""We're not going to be able to sustain a bold economy unless we start controlling these costs. But I'll tell you one thing right now, I'll defend Barack Obama as the day is long because what he did to me was heroic.""

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development keeps tabs on the health spending of the 34 nations that belong to the group.

According to the organization’s latest data, Booker’s numbers are spot on.

Spending on health care in the U.S. in 2009 totaled 17.4 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. That puts the U.S. at the top of the group for medical spending.

The Netherlands took second place, at 12 percent of its gross domestic product. Following behind by tenths of a percentage point: France at 11.8 percent; Germany at 11.6 percent; Denmark at 11.5 percent; and Canada and Switzerland, both at 11.4 percent.

PolitiFact New Jersey reached out to health care experts to gauge the significance of the difference.

Robert Field, a professor of law and health management and policy at Drexel University, said in an email that ""experts differ on how much we should be concerned"" but, he said,  ""without question, there are two major worries - health care costs are the biggest driver of Medicare spending growth, which will be the biggest driver of federal deficit growth in coming years, and there is a tremendous amount of inefficiency, so we are not getting better health for our extra spending.""

David Auerbach, a health policy researcher with the RAND Corporation said there’s ""cause for worry because we seem to be growing faster than [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] countries in the past decade or so.""

""We still don't have much more in the system in the way of checks on spending and it could well continue into the future eating into government and personal spending for other needs,"" Auerbach said.

Our ruling

Booker claimed that the U.S. spends ""over 17 percent of its GDP on health care costs when our closest competitor nations are spending about 12.""

The United States outspends 33 other large, industrialized democracies on medical costs. The country’s health care spending hit 17.4 percent of the nation’s economy in 2009, compared with 12 percent for the Netherlands, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

We rate the statement True.

President of Rhode Island’s largest homeless shelter says the state has one of the highest numbers of nonprofits per capita in the U.S.
","
Times are tough for nonprofits. Financing from state and federal sources is down and people generally have less to give than before the recession.

Anne Nolan, president of Crossroads Rhode Island, which operates the state’s largest homeless shelter, knows this first hand. On a recent episode of WJAR's ""10 News Conference,"" she said that while more people are in need, there’s less money out there to help them.

That’s undoubtedly true across the country, but, said Nolan, the problem in Rhode Island is exacerbated.

""We have one of the highest percentages per capita of nonprofits in this state of any state in the union,"" she said on the show that aired Nov. 27.  ""There is a limited amount of funding, a limited number of donors out there, and that waters it all down.""

The Providence Journal reported Dec. 18 that donations to Crossroads were down in recent months in part because of its support of EngageRI, a business-backed group that pushed for an overhaul of the state retirement system.

But we were also interested in Nolan's claim that because the state has such a high concentration of nonprofits, there’s greater competition here for financing than in other states.

When we asked Nolan where she got her information, she said she thought it came from a study on Rhode Island’s nonprofit sector done either by the United Way of Rhode Island or the Rhode Island Foundation.

The Rhode Island Foundation did publish a study in August on the state’s many nonprofits. According to the report, the number of active nonprofits registered with the secretary of state’s office in 2011 is 7,306. That sounds like a lot. But the list isn’t made up only of charities, foundations or social services groups.

It also includes condominium associations, sports teams, religious groups and professional associations. Most are small. Two-thirds operate with budgets and assets of less than $100,000.

The report also said that nonprofits employ more than 18 percent of Rhode Island’s labor force, tying us with New York as the states with the highest percentage of people working at nonprofits. That seems logical considering the high number of colleges and universities in Rhode Island and the large hospitals located here.

But the report doesn’t make any comparisons among states based on the number of nonprofits per capita.

The United Way published the results of a survey of Rhode Island nonprofit health and human service providers in March 2009. The survey focused on fiscal issues and how organizations’ finances were being affected by the recession. Sixty percent of the 230 respondents reported a decrease in total income over the prior year.

The survey sheds some light on the struggles of nonprofits, but it doesn’t take up the per capita question either.

We didn’t give up. We knew there must be some organization that keeps track of this sort of thing.

That organization, it turns out, is the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan Washington, D.C.-based public policy think tank that was established in 1968 by the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson. It keeps track of a range of statistics on nonprofits through its National Center for Charitable Statistics.

A search of the institute’s website found a table titled ""Number of Registered Nonprofit Organizations by State, 2008"" -- the most recent year for data -- which was based on 990 Form filings with the Internal Revenue Service. According to the table, Rhode Island had 7,200 registered nonprofits in 2008, of which 4,959 were 501(c)(3) organizations, which include charities, foundations, hospitals, universities and social services groups such as Crossroads.

Using an estimated 2008 population for Rhode Island of 1,050,788, the chart calculated a figure of 68.5 nonprofits per 10,000 people and 47.2 501(c)(3) groups per 10,000 people. That ranked Rhode Island 11th in the nation for nonprofits per capita and 8th for 501(c)(3) groups.

Not surprisingly, Washington, D.C., ranked first with 250.3 nonprofits per 10,000 people and 158 501(c)(3) groups. But that number is skewed because many of the groups registered in the nation’s capital have a national or international focus.

Most of the other states in the top 10 are geographically large with small populations, such as Montana (second in both categories), North Dakota (fifth in both categories) and South Dakota (sixth in the former category and seventh in the latter).

The national average was 49.8 nonprofits per 10,000 people and 35.3 501(c)(3) groups.

The Urban Institute also has interesting figures on charitable contributions that relate to Nolan’s larger point about an increasingly tough funding environment. Based on IRS data on tax returns, the average charitable contribution made by a Rhode Island individual dropped from $926 in 2004 to $787 in 2009.

That brought Rhode Island’s ranking for the size of an individual’s charitable contribution down from 37th in the nation to 45th. In comparison, the average contribution in Massachusetts was $1,143 in 2009, which ranked 19th, and in Connecticut, it was $1,517, which ranked 4th.

Our ruling

Nolan’s point that Rhode Island nonprofits are having a more difficult time raising money is valid. People just aren’t giving as much these days.

Whether Rhode Island has one of the highest per capita numbers of nonprofits is open to interpretation. The state isn’t among the top five in the country. It’s just outside the top 10.

But the state does have the eighth-highest number of 501(c)(3) organizations per capita. These are the groups, like Crossroads, that provide health and social services and are the type that people probably think of when it comes to nonprofits.

For that reason, we believe Nolan has a point, but her statement needed further explanation. We rule the claim Mostly True.

 Do Christmas trees really grow in all 50 states?
","
Oregonians are lucky in that we don’t have to think about where we get our holiday trees. We are the No. 1 producer of firs, pines and spruce, beating out all other states in providing the scented, festive trees that grace many homes this season.

Perhaps in honor of that distinction, U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley helped pushed a resolution claiming the first full week of December 2011 as ""National Christmas Tree Week."" The resolution notes that there are close to 15,000 farms growing Christmas trees in the United States and that there are roughly 100,000 people employed in the real tree industry.

The resolution also states that Christmas trees are grown in all 50 states.

Apparently, this is a common statistic repeated in Christmas tree fun facts around the country. But we had to think about it. Are there really Christmas tree farms in tropical Hawaii? What about in sunny New Mexico?

The claim kind of made sense -- where else would people living in those states get their trees? -- but we had to check.  

""Well, it's one of those things I ‘know, but can't technically verify,’"" said Rick Dungey of the National Christmas Tree Association, a trade group for real farm-grown trees. He directed us to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which conducts a census survey of farms every five years, the most recent in 2007.

Oregon led with 6.8 million trees harvested in 2007, out of 17.4 million nationwide. Alaska, Nevada and Wyoming were at the bottom, with zero cut trees harvested. So maybe Oregon’s junior senator had his facts wrong?

We called Catherine Howard, publisher of Christmas Trees Magazine, a trade publication for growers. She said she didn’t know whether there are tree farms in all 50 states, but she suspects there may not be many -- or any -- growers in the Dakotas or in Montana.

""You never hear about them; they're just not involved,"" she said. ""And, probably, I'm guessing Arizona and New Mexico... it's very hard to grow Christmas trees in the Southwest.""  

So now we’d stumbled upon new states that may lack tree farms, but nothing definite yet. We continued sleuthing.

There are several websites where you can find a place in your state to buy fresh cut trees. The National Christmas Tree Association did not list any members in Wyoming, New Mexico, North Dakota or Alaska. But of course, the sites are not comprehensive.

We plugged Alaska into the Christmas Tree Farm Network, and we found Bob Smith -- owner of Bob Smith’s Minnesota Christmas Trees in Anchorage. That’s right. Alaskans have flocked to him since 1962 to buy Balsam firs and Scotch pines from Minnesota.

Smith said he didn’t know of any tree farms in Alaska, either, but there may be a small tree farmer he’s missed. Anyway, why are Christmas trees hard to grow in Alaska? It takes a long time, he said. ""The ground never gets that warm. They get a lot of daylight in the summer, but they never get that warm.""

Next, we turned to the dry Southwest where we found several listings for cut holiday trees in Arizona. Mast-Roth Farms looked promising. We found the store online and learned that the family behind Mast-Roth has proudly ""been bringing highest-quality Oregon Christmas Trees to the greater Phoenix area for over 30 years.""

Well, so much for locally grown in Phoenix. But then again, where else are Oregon Christmas trees to go? We’re not expected to consume one third of the country’s cut holiday trees, are we?

Finally, we received a call from Alex Minchenkov, public affairs specialist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service. He confirmed that as of 2009 there were no cut Christmas tree farms in Wyoming or North Dakota. Utah was near the bottom of the list with two tree farm operations. The numbers, he acknowledged, may not include small-scale farmers.

Which brings us to our final point. Even though Merkley’s resolution highlights commercial Christmas tree farms, his statement honors the tree itself. And people in Alaska, Arizona and Nevada can always get a permit and cut their own tree from a forest.

Merkley spokesman Jamal Raad points out exactly that: ""The resolution says Christmas trees are grown in all 50 states, not that there are Christmas tree farms in all 50 states, which may or may not be true.""

We could downgrade Merkley for his statement, because we’re not sure there are tree farms in all 50 states, and the resolution emphsizes commercial tree farms. But that would be so Grinch-like. Instead, we rule the statement True. Christmas trees grow in all 50 states, and they bring a lot of joy to families in the United States.

Pro-Perry super PAC says Gingrich teamed with Pelosi on global warming
","In a video ad, a super PAC promoting Gov. Rick Perry's presidential candidacy attacks two Perry rivals for the Republican nomination, Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney, suggesting that their records prove they are not conservatives. In the style of an old newsreel, the ad from Make Us Great Again, which was formed this year by Austin lobbyist Mike Toomey, a longtime Perry ally, highlights several criticisms that have been lobbed at the former U.S. House speaker and former Massachusetts governor. Among the charges the ad aims at Gingrich is that he joined U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., ""in support of global warming."" We take the wording to mean that Gingrich aligned with Pelosi on the issue of global warming, a pairing that has drawn renewed attention lately. A similar claim is also being heard in a television ad placed in Florida and Iowa this month by another super PAC, Restore Our Future, which is staffed and funded by supporters of Mitt Romney. The ad attacks Gingrich over ""a ton of baggage"" and includes the statement that Gingrich ""teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming."" PolitiFact National looked into that claim for a Dec. 21, 2011, fact-check. The Restore Our Future ad cites the website Newtfacts.com, which lays out a list of — you guessed it — more claims and citations about Gingrich, including this one: ""Gingrich shot an ad with Nancy Pelosi in 2008 calling for action on global warming."" It is followed by a link to the Pelosi-Gingrich spot, in which Gingrich sits on a couch next to Pelosi, who at that time was the House speaker but now is the minority leader. ""We don’t always see eye to eye, do we, Newt?"" Pelosi says. ""No,"" Gingrich answers, ""but we do agree: Our country must take action to address climate change."" Pelosi: ""We need cleaner forms of energy, and we need them fast."" Gingrich: ""If enough of us demand action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need."" The ad directs viewers to the website WeCanSolveIt.org, with the final words from Pelosi, ""Together, we can do this."" The ad was created by a Gore-founded organization that works to spread awareness and prompt action to address climate change. Formerly the Alliance for Climate Protection, it’s now known as the Climate Reality Project. WeCanSolveIt.org is the former name of the site now called ClimateRealityProject.org. In an interview with the online news show The Young Turks in December 2011, Gore said that he had asked Gingrich to do the ad with Pelosi. It was part of a larger campaign featuring "" 'unlikely pairs,' who disagree on many issues but appear together to help thwart climate change,"" according to a 2008 news story in the San Francisco Chronicle. During the current campaign season, Gingrich has expressed regret about making that ad. In a section of his campaign website devoted to ""answering the attacks,"" Gingrich is quoted as telling Fox News’ Brett Baier in November that making the ad with Pelosi was ""probably the dumbest single thing I've ever done."" It goes on to explain that Gingrich opposes cap and trade legislation (although PolitiFact has found he supported it in the past) and that he favors increased domestic oil drilling. Our sense is the super PAC's video accurately touches on Gingrich teaming with Pelosi against global warming.

Greater Wisconsin Committee says cuts in school aid left some students without chairs and 47 kids in a classroom
","
Highlighting $800 million in school aid cuts in Wisconsin’s 2011-’13 budget, critics of Gov. Scott Walker are attacking what they view as serious side effects from his fiscal medicine.

A TV ad by the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee uses interview clips to hammer Walker for backing business tax breaks while reducing state support for local schools.

The speakers -- unidentified by name or position, but described by the group as teachers, parents or grandparents -- make claims about school staffing cuts and larger class sizes.  

Their claims are presented as more than random anecdotes; one source listed on the screen is a report issued by the state Department of Public Instruction, which oversees public education in Wisconsin.

A few of the statements caught our attention -- and that of many readers:

""My daughter has not enough tables and chairs in her room and she has kids sitting on the floor,"" a man says, sitting with a woman and two young girls in a restaurant. A citation flashes on the screen: the state budget bill.

Then a young man standing outside says: ""Forty-seven in a room, they don’t get much attention."" An onscreen graphic reads, ""Classes are overcrowded,"" and cites the aforementioned report issued by the Department of Public Instruction -- a widely publicized report summarizing a statewide survey of schools following the budget cuts.

Together, they essentially make the same point: Walker’s school-aid cuts were so devastating that students are without chairs and a government survey found 47 kids in a classroom.

Is the Greater Wisconsin Committee right?

First, viewers may have seen slightly different versions of the Greater Wisconsin Committee ad -- at least three were produced and they all vary a bit. And we can’t show them to you here: The group does not post its ads online but released a script.

We’ll test the specific anecdotes but also look at the statewide situation.

The group argues the ad does not suggest that the anecdotes are representative of the situation statewide, but we disagree.

The ""not enough chairs"" anecdote is presented as one family’s experience, but the ""47 in a room"" line is presented as a broad statement of fact, bolstered by the ""classes are overcrowded"" tagline and citation of a statewide survey as proof.

And the GWC is paying for the ad, so it is responsible for the message that the individuals are conveying.

When asked for backup, the group’s leader, Michelle McGrorty, cited the statewide survey published in November by the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators in conjunction with the state DPI, which is independent of the governor’s office.

Previously, we rated two claims from that survey.

We found False a statement by Walker that ""the overwhelming number"" of school districts reported their staff stayed the same or grew after the 2011-’13 state budget. And we also rated False a claim by the state’s largest teachers’ union that state budget cuts for schools    resulted in nearly 4,000 educator layoffs.

Let’s study up.

Both sides have used the survey to argue their case on class sizes. The survey covered most schools, so it has value. At the same time, its conclusions have to be treated with caution because a district is counted as having higher class sizes even if only one grade was affected.

There is no doubt that at least one class size went up in a significant number of cases.

In elementary school, 42 percent of districts reported at least one class size increased. The middle school and high school data was more specific; 21 percent to 24 percent of core subject-area classes saw an increase in class sizes.

Cutbacks in teaching staff in the wake of the state aid cuts played a role in increased class sizes, the survey found. Nearly two out of three districts (63 percent) reported a net loss of teachers.

That’s what we know.

What we don’t know -- and what the GWC cannot establish from the report  -- is the size of the classes to bolster its ""overcrowding"" view.

The survey did not ask how many kids were in classrooms, or how many more students were added to classrooms. It simply asked whether any class sizes had increased. Nowhere in its analysis of the survey does DPI describe the resulting class sizes as ""overcrowded.""

According to WASDA and DPI officials, the survey did not attempt to get at whether school officials viewed their classes as overcrowded -- in part because it is a subjective term.

The survey does not document any shortage of desks or chairs in classrooms either.

Asked about the survey, McGrorty said the findings ""definitely"" mean there will be some overcrowding.

But we contacted DPI and WASDA and another trade association and found no one claiming overcrowding or any specific increase in class size averages.

WASDA has long tracked increased class sizes -- and says they are not a new phenomenon. Twenty years of state limits on school taxation have driven up class sizes for years, said Miles Turner, executive director of the group. He and others noted particularly that ""specials"" classes such as art and music have been combined as districts have laid off some of those teachers.

Another statewide association, the Wisconsin Association of School Boards, said class size increase have not risen to ""troublesome"" levels.

Judging whether a class is overcrowded depends on the grade level, the type of students, the subject and other factors, Turner and several school superintendents and administrators told us.

We have none of that information from the ad.

So the claim has plenty of problems.

That leaves us with fact checking the specific anecdotes, but Greater Wisconsin -- which is funded by labor, Democratic Party groups and wealthy individual donors -- refuses to name the people or even cite the districts involved.

McGrorty told us the group is concerned about potential harassment or threats of violence against the speakers.

She also said the group was told that a school had to combine two classrooms because a teacher was laid off, and it lacked enough chairs. In the claims of classes increasing to 47, McGrorty contends it was a high school English class.

We were not able to identify the districts.

The statewide teachers union, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, said it couldn’t identify them either, but said it had received reports from members about increased class sizes.

We also contacted schools in Milwaukee and Janesville, two districts hit hardest by budget cuts because they had teachers’ contracts in place and could not take advantage of health insurance and pension savings that Walker’s budget provided.

Janesville told us class sizes were limited to 30 for most grades by school board policy. The board in December 2011 bumped that up to 32. A district spokesman could cite no overcrowding.

In Milwaukee, the president of the teachers union, Robert Peterson, told us no survey had been done there but he was receiving numerous reports of larger class sizes -- more than 40 in some.

District spokeswoman Roseann St. Aubin concurred in part: Class sizes vary from 17 to 41 depending on the type of class and students. But she said no comparable data was available for the year before. Class sizes did jump in schools that lost special funding due to budget cuts, she said.

We heard that a gym class at Burroughs Middle School in Milwaukee had almost 50 kids. True, St. Aubin said, but two aides assist the teacher.

We read a comment on a Fox Valley TV news story, apparently posted by a teacher, that claimed she lacked enough chairs for a kindergarten class. The district in question was Oshkosh, best we could tell. An official there said the classes had enough chairs; the teacher who apparently posted the comment did not return calls.

Our conclusion

In trying to show that Walker’s budget has caused school overcrowding, the Greater Wisconsin Committee misuses a survey of schools, cloaks its anecdotes in anonymity and provides no verification of its assertions.

In our view, the ad’s message is that school crowding is common and dramatic, assertions not backed up by key school officials or the research cited. Class sizes have increased, and Walker’s budget is partly responsible, but that trend began before Walker, and other factors play in.

In any case, that is not the same as ""overcrowding"" -- a description not even school and union officials are using.

We may revisit this item if new evidence emerges, but these claims -- as presented -- are thin and misleading.

We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2011/dec/23/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/greater-wisconsin-committee-says-cuts-school-aid-l/

Richard Franklin says a trash mound on U.S. 290 is 800 feet tall
","
Travis County commissioner candidate Richard Franklin III has a number of issues he wants to address on behalf of eastern Travis County, and one of them gets bigger every week.

At the Central Texas Democratic Forum on Nov. 29, 2011, Franklin said: ""There’s a trash mound on (U.S.) 290 that’s 800 feet tall."" Franklin later told us he’d like to see leaders use more recycling and technology to reduce or eliminate the pile.

His figure grabbed our attention, considering the tallest building in Austin is the Austonian residential tower, which is 683 feet tall. Another common reference point is Mount Bonnell, often called the highest point in Austin, which is 784 feet tall, according to the city.

But there’s an important distinction: The Austonian’s 683 feet are measured, as is normal for buildings, from base to top; Mount Bonnell’s 784 feet are measured, as is normal for geographical features, from sea level.

Franklin told us the site he meant was Republic Services’ Sunset Farms Landfill in eastern Travis County, on Giles Road north of U.S. 290 about three miles west of Manor -- and he met us on the side of the road, in view of the landfill. From there, the mound rises gradually, with a thin covering of grassy vegetation up its sides, to a cap of garbage. A bulldozer and compactor busily rumbled around the top as birds circled.

We talked with Franklin about the landfill’s height limit in relation to sea level, which touched off local debate a few years ago when Allied Waste, the predecessor to Republic Services, sought to raise the limit from 720 feet above sea level to 795 feet by filing a new permit application with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

The 2006 request was met by opposition from neighbors and the Austin City Council, according to Austin American-Statesman news stories. The council passed a resolution in May 2007 opposing Allied’s application, but later dropped its opposition after Allied agreed to close the landfill Nov. 1, 2015, the paper reported.

The Statesman reported that on Sept. 9, 2009, the state environmental commission granted Republic’s permit with the 795-foot limit. Travis County Commissioners Court records from Sept. 29, 2009, show that the commission voted to approve the permit after questioning Republic officials about the height of the landfill relative to Mount Bonnell. Project engineer Ray Shull told them that with the surrounding land at 640 feet and the cap at 795 feet, the final pile itself would max out at 155 feet above ground level -- ""not anywhere close to the tallest structure, even man-made, in Travis County.""

When we inquired, the state environmental commission reported a slightly lower base elevation for the site -- 613 feet, spokeswoman Lisa Wheeler said. Lee Kuhn, Republic’s general manager for the Austin area, separately said that ""ground level"" at the site varies from 610 feet to 640 feet above sea level.

So depending on where an observer is standing, the mound might appear to gradually rise 155 feet to 185 feet -- though only if Sunset Farms reaches the permitted height. Republic no longer expects that to happen, area president Brad Dugas told us, in part because the economic slowdown has caused area businesses and industries to produce less waste.

When we visited the landfill, it stood about 75 feet short of the limit, according to Republic officials -- so it appeared to crest 80 to 110 feet above us, depending on where we stood nearby.

Kuhn and Republic area environmental manager Michael Stewart told us the highest parts of the landfill have lately been 720 feet above sea level. As Republic continues building the hill, Stewart said, the highest part will eventually be a two-acre crest, with the rest of the mound sloping down across its 251-acre footprint.

In comparison, both Mount Bonnell's 784-foot elevation and its apparent height are greater. From the trailhead on Mount Bonnell Road, the rise from the bottom of the steps to the top of the limestone peak is 227 feet, according to Kim McKnight at Austin’s Parks and Recreation Department. And to a viewer on Lake Austin, where the water’s surface is kept about 492 feet above sea level, the peak should appear 292 feet high.

We got back in touch with Franklin, who said it matters to him how tall the pile is compared to sea level. ""It’s 800 feet above sea level, with a hundred-foot mound of trash that you can actually see,"" Franklin said.

To evaluate the statement itself, let’s look at the words again: ""There’s a trash mound on (U.S.) 290 that’s 800 feet tall."" That’s close to right when comparing the top of the pile to sea level, but we think it’s more reasonable to judge the view from ground level -- and that’s where the statement is way off. We rate Franklin’s claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/dec/22/richard-franklin-iii/richard-franklin-says-trash-mound-us-290-800-feet-/

Rick Perry says that as governor, Mitt Romney raised business taxes 20 percent in Massachusetts
","
In a TV ad airing in Iowa, Rick Perry said Mitt Romney, ""raised business taxes 20 percent"" when he was governor of Massachusetts.

That so?

To back the claim, Perry’s presidential campaign noted an Oct. 1, 2011, New York Times article describing then-Gov. Romney, faced with a $3 billion state deficit, signing off on an aide’s 2003 proposal to ban a practice then enabling banks to reduce their state taxes. The banks were transferring billions of dollars in assets, such as mortgages, into real estate investment trusts that were, by design, subject to virtually no taxes, the Times recapped.

And, according to the article, the state’s subsequent ban on that practice and other steps on Romney’s watch ultimately resulted in companies paying about $370 million a year in additional taxes, ""a nearly 20 percent increase from the period before (Romney) took office.""

The story attributes that calculation to an analysis by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a research group that the newspaper said receives financing from corporations.

Andrew Bagley, a foundation spokesman, told us in an interview that Massachusetts businesses paid $377 million more in taxes in fiscal 2007, which included several months of Romney’s last year as governor, than the $1.6 billion they were averaging annually before the recession that socked the state as Romney was sworn in during fiscal 2003. The state’s fiscal year runs from July through June.

The $377 million increase shows up on a spreadsheet breaking down additional revenue generated for the state from 22 changes that took effect while Romney was governor. According to the spreadsheet, the closing of the real-estate investment loophole accounted for $50 million of the increased revenue, ranking second to a change related to interest and royalties that had yielded $58 million in added revenue as of 2007.

Massachusetts ""had an enormous hole to fill"" due to the recession, Bagley said, adding that while there were complaints about the actions taken with Romney’s approval, ""none of us could come up with a better way"" of filling the hole ""than having to raise some of that from revenues.""

Bagley said the spreadsheet originated with a state agency, the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. A bureau spokesman, Robert Bliss, confirmed as much and told us that foundation researchers are viewed as honest brokers. ""I wouldn’t quarrel with their work,"" Bliss said.

The cited figures -- the $377 million increase in business-paid taxes compared to  the pre-recession business-paid tax base of $1.6 billion -- divides out to a nearly 24 percent increase.

We noticed, though, that two changes listed on the spreadsheet weren’t borne, or at least entirely borne, by businesses.  Those changes, including the interception of lottery winnings to pay a winner’s past-due taxes, accounted for $9 million of the increased revenues, reducing the increased load on businesses as of 2007 to $368 million -- a slight downgrade.

Separately, we noticed a 2006 Cato Institute ""report card"" on the fiscal records of governors indicating that under Romney, Massachusetts tax rates did not increase.

Is it fair to say Romney drove up business taxes, as Perry said?

John Regan, spokesman for Associated Industries of Massachusetts, a pro-business group that represents employers, suggested in an interview that weighing changes in tax rates alone would be misleading. As governor, he said, Romney ""adjusted the tax code under the guise of closing loopholes, the net effect of which was hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue, the bulk of that from business.""

Romney’s campaign did not reply to our inquiry about Perry’s statement. A Nexis search led us to an Oct. 15, 2007, letter to the editor of The Boston Globe from Eric Fehrnstrom, a Boston consultant then identified as a senior adviser to Romney’s 2008 presidential campaign.

Fehrnstrom’s letter, reacting to a writer’s critique of Romney’s tax record, said corporate ""loophole closings are not tax increases. They are an attempt to keep in check aggressive tax accounting."" His letter also said that Romney balanced the state’s budget for four years ""without raising taxes"" and signed into law a commuter tax deduction, an investment tax credit, sales tax holidays, an expanded property tax break for seniors, a more generous research and development credit, a manufacturing tax rebate, a $250 million capital gains tax refund and a tax break for movie companies doing business in the Bay State.

Our ruling

By the time Romney’s term as governor was ending, Massachusetts businesses were ponying up about 20 percent more in tax revenue due to actions he approved. To be sure, those increases were not due to hikes in corporate or other tax rates. Still, Perry’s claim has a reasonable basis.

In Buffalo, crime has fallen during Brown’s tenure
","Mayor Byron Brown tells voters that crime before the pandemic consistently fell in Buffalo. ""We’ve seen, before the pandemic, from 2006 to 2019, year after year, crime in various categories and crime overall, has actually gone down in the city of Buffalo,"" Brown said in an interview with radio station WBEN. ""Unfortunately, in 2020, as we’ve dealt with this pandemic and we’ve had to police in a different way, and in 2021, as we continue to deal with the pandemic, we have seen an increase in crime as communities all across the nation have seen an increase in crime, but before that, crime had been falling, every year, year after year, in the city of Buffalo."" Brown has made versions of this claim before. He returned to it Thursday in a debate with Democratic nominee India Walton and two other candidates, saying ""from 2006 to 2019 crime overall in the city of Buffalo went down year after year after year."" Brown, a four-term mayor, launched a write-in campaign to win re-election after losing the Democratic primary to Walton. And he has also mounted a legal effort to get his name on the ballot as an independent candidate. Crime has emerged an important issue in the campaign. So, we looked at the numbers to see if his claim holds up. We reached out to the Brown administration, which provided statistics for seven major crime categories: homicide, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. Since Brown’s claim is about crime between 2006, when he became mayor, and 2019, before the pandemic began, we consider only those years here. The data shows occurrences of all seven of the major crimes fell from 2006 to 2019, both overall and within each category. Taken together, the crimes fell by 44% between 2006 and 2019. There was a year-over-year decrease every year, except in 2007, when crime increased by 1.7%, and in 2018, when it increased by two-tenths of a percent. To give context to the crime trends over Brown’s tenure before the pandemic, we looked at each crime category. In none of the crime categories did the number fall every year. • Homicides. Down 36% from 2006 to 2019, but five years had increases, ranging from 7% to 65%.  • Rapes. Reports down 26%, but seven years had increases – more years than when the number of rapes decreased. • Robberies. Down 52%, but four years had increases, ranging from 1% to less than 6%. • Assaults. Down 22%, but three years had increases, ranging from 5% to 13%. • Burglaries. Down 64%, but two years had increases, one 8%, the other 5%. • Larcenies. Down 32%, but four years had mostly modest increases. • Motor vehicle theft. Down 69%, but three years had increases. We also looked at crime data on the CitiStat website, where the city publishes statistics that are searchable by the public. CitiStat offers slightly different figures for the crimes by year, and shows a consistent decline between 2008, the first year of the dataset, and 2019. In 2018, the CitiStat data is more favorable to Brown than what the administration gave PolitiFact New York. CitiStat shows total crimes dropped by 367 in 2018. We also looked at data kept by New York State’s Division of Criminal Justice Services and by the FBI. The sets are similar, though the FBI’s online data sets go further back in time. The data was similar to the city’s data, though there are differences in some figures. FBI data showed that crime went up slightly in 2007 and in 2018, as the city data showed. Christopher R. Herrmann, who analyzed statistics as a member of the New York City Police Department and is an assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, looked at crime data from Buffalo CitiStat, the state and the FBI between 2016 and 2020. His analysis found that more often, CitiStat data showed less crime occured than state and federal data. Buffalo Police Department Deputy Commissioner Joseph A. Gramaglia said that the city’s data is based on real-time data as it comes in, but when the city reports data to the FBI, it’s reported in intervals. ""We work very diligently to be as accurate as possible with the data,"" Gramaglia said. Brown claimed that before the pandemic, ""crime had been falling, every year, year after year, in the city of Buffalo."" Crime did fall during his tenure until the pandemic. Overall, crime fell by 44% between 2006 and 2019.  There were two years where the decline was not consistent. In 2007, overall crime increased by 1.7 percent, and in 2018, overall crime increased by .2 percent. In addition, every category of crime had some increases in between, along with some decreases through the years.

Gavin Newsom Showed Up At An Encampment Sweep. Were The People Living There Moved Into Safe Housing?
","Caltrans officials clearing a Berkeley homeless encampment last month were joined by a surprise guest: Gov. Gavin Newsom, who personally spoke with the workers about their efforts to move unhoused people into shelters and was photographed at the site moving items. Ninety minutes later, the photos were posted on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, along with a statement: ""California is moving folks out of encampments, into safe housing and getting them the mental health services they need. The conditions at this site in Berkeley are unacceptable and unsafe. Homelessness can be solved and the #CAcomeback Plan puts us on that path.""  Some Californians immediately expressed their displeasure online, calling the photos ""cruel"" and ""propaganda."" Optics aside, there was another issue: Several local homeless advocates said not everyone from the site, known as the Seabreeze encampment, was placed into safe housing, as the tweet suggests. While Newsom was taking pictures, advocates claimed many former residents of the encampment were left in limbo, desperately seeking new places to live. With the local controversy well underway and the gubernatorial recall days away, we set out on a fact check. The Encampment The Seabreeze encampment was located at the intersection of University Avenue and Interstate 80, near the Berkeley Marina. It was comprised of ""upstairs,"" located in the grassy area between the freeway and Frontage Road, and ""downstairs,"" an area next to the freeway underneath the University Avenue overpass. The site, on land owned by the California Department of Transportation, or Caltrans, was a long-standing encampment in the community. Some unhoused people had resided there for years, including Christopher ""Chaos"" Lilley, who said he lived at the site since March 2018. It was also one of the largest encampments in the city, with an estimated 80 people at the time of the sweep, according to figures published by Berkeleyside. A local nonprofit, Where Do We Go Berkeley, was involved in managing the tent community. The group assists residents of encampments in the Interstate 80 corridor in the East Bay. During most of the COVID-19 pandemic, Caltrans halted encampment clear-outs, an effort to prevent the spread of the virus and ensure residents remained near their medical service providers. But at the start of the summer, officials resumed sweeps. Newsom joined officials for the clean-out of the ""downstairs"" portion of the encampment on Aug. 9. The ""upstairs"" was cleared the following week. The sweep was prompted by deteriorating conditions, said Caltrans spokesperson Matt Rocco. He said a large fire broke out at the camp several weeks before and that it ""presented potentially hazardous conditions for the traveling public."" ""Electrical boxes for lighting on the quad area are continuously being broken into and tapped for power sources, along with constant fires from unsafe heating equipment,"" he added. Shelter Or The Streets At the ""downstairs"" portion, signs notifying residents of the encampment’s pending closure appeared roughly 10 days before the clearing. California cities generally give residents at least 72 hours notice of pending sweeps, and Caltrans must give notice under the terms of a $5.5 million settlement of a class-action lawsuit in early 2020. Officials also cannot arrest people for sleeping on the street without first offering them shelter, the result of a 2018 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Martin v. Boise. But they aren’t required to give them social services such as permanent housing or health care following the evictions, said Heather Freinkel and Danny Homer, managing attorneys at the Alameda County Homeless Action Center. ""While Martin v. Boise prohibits criminal action against homeless people when no alternative shelter is offered or available, that only applies to criminalization,"" Freinkel said. ""Cities can still come in and throw people's property in a dumpster and force them to leave, as long as they don't arrest or charge anyone."" Ian Cordova Morales, president of Where Do We Go Berkeley, said the signs posted at the camp encouraged residents to call 211, Alameda County’s housing and health services hotline, to access housing services. He noted the signs were only posted in English, even though several residents only spoke Spanish. Additionally, he said the outreach worker in charge of helping people enter Berkeley’s shelter system was not initially present at the sweep. ""He arrived an hour late,"" Morales said. ""So at the time of the sweep, when people were getting kicked out of the area, there was nobody there to offer them services. They were all gone by the time he showed up."" The city of Berkeley assisted with on-the-ground outreach efforts prior to the sweep, said spokesperson Matthai Chakko. He said workers visited the encampment at least once per week in May and June, and held an event to provide information about housing options in late June. Those options came with offers for transportation, he added. ""Our commitment to people who are unhoused means that the City, Alameda County, and nonprofit partners we fund continue to provide outreach and shelter and service offers to as many people as possible who are unhoused,"" Chakko said. ""We strive to serve all within the constraints of our resources."" For the ""downstairs"" sweep, Morales said unhoused residents ultimately had three options: go to the Grayson Shelter, try to secure a spot in Project Roomkey or refuse services entirely and stay on the streets. The Grayson Shelter, formerly known as the Horizon Transitional Shelter, opened in July and can temporarily house 50 people. It is a 24-hour shelter, which Morales said makes it a better option than what was previously available in Berkeley. But he said it’s little more than a warehouse with tents. ""The general vibe of the place freaks people out a little bit because it's got a weird set up,"" Morales said. ""People were getting FEMA vibes from it. And unhoused people are generally a little bit paranoid about FEMA."" Project Roomkey, a program partially funded by the state, was started by the Newsom administration in March 2020, has provided temporary shelter for tens of thousands of homeless Californians in hotel and motel rooms since the start of the pandemic.  Supporters say the program prevented major outbreaks of the virus in the homeless community and connects residents with housing and social services. They say the rooms offer simple but profound benefits — clean water, the chance to take a shower and dignity.  Morales said most unhoused residents of the Seabreeze encampment were open to joining the Roomkey program. But by the time of the sweep, finding rooms was a struggle. Lilley, the unhoused resident who had lived at the tent community for three years, is currently participating in Roomkey. He said it took five days after the sweep to secure his room. In the meantime, he added, he was forced to find new places to sleep on the street. Even though he now has a room, Lilley said the program has been far from ideal. ""We do not get a key to our own rooms,"" he said. ""If we are not in by 11 p.m. we can't come till 6 a.m., although there are two security guards in the parking lot 24 hours per day."" He added that security guards search residents’ backpacks before they are allowed to enter the hotel and that each person is only allowed to have a certain number of items in their room. ""It's very stressful,"" Lilley said. Unhoused people often encounter unexpected barriers to entering temporary housing, Homer, of the Homeless Action Center, said. In most places, animals are not allowed in shelters and storage space is not available for bikes, carts and other belongings. Sometimes, shelters and other housing options are in unfamiliar areas. ""As an analogy, if someone came to my apartment and said, ‘Hey, we have to bulldoze this building, pack a backpack and come with me to another temporary apartment sight unseen,’ I'd be hesitant too,"" Homer said. ""So even though it might seem like a good offer, I can understand people being tentative, suspicious and some refusing a room or shelter bed."" The Impact It’s unclear where everyone from the ""downstairs"" of the Seabreeze encampment is currently located. Rocco of Caltrans said that local agencies reported 15 clients in the encampment in June. Of those 15 people, he said 11 were placed into temporary or permanent housing. Four declined services and remain unhoused. But other sources found more people remained unsheltered. Berkeleyside reported that 35 people lived in the camp, based on data from Where Do We Go Berkeley. At least 10 are still on the streets, at least 10 have some sort of shelter and one is deceased. It’s unclear where the others are located. Morales said he and others with Where Do We Go Berkeley were ""upset"" by the statement from the governor’s office. ""The biggest problem that I had with it was [Newsom] putting out this message that everything is fine and that everything went great and they cleaned and the people got housing when our whole group, our message and what I've been working on for the last two years, is letting people know that things are not fine,"" Morales said. ""They are as far from fine as they could be."" Lilley said he knows at least five people who are still unsheltered. He called the statement from the governor’s office ""an absolute lie."" ""Instead of looking like he was going through our possessions and destroying what little we had … he could have had a conversation with us himself to show his concern,"" Lilley said. ""But instead he focused on garbage and cleaning it up."" Rocco confirmed that Newsom did not speak with any unhoused people while he was at the encampment sweep. ""Gov. Newsom arrived around 10 a.m., and by that time, there were no people experiencing homelessness present at the site,"" Rocco said. He added that Newsom is ""dedicated to providing proper care to those struggling the most and who’ve found themselves homeless due to mental health and addiction struggles."" In the weeks since the ""downstairs"" sweep, Newsom has appeared at several other encampment clear-outs and clean-ups, including one in San Francisco at the end of last month. Our Rating A statement from the governor’s office claimed that California is providing unhoused people with services and shelter. It was posted on social media alongside photos of Newsom assisting with an encampment sweep. While the post gives the impression that all or most people at the encampment received housing, that’s only partially true. At least four people declined the offer of housing and remained unsheltered, according to state officials. A local advocacy group believes more than twice as many remain on the streets. People who did accept services largely ended up in temporary housing programs, but some spent days after the sweep on the streets while sorting through the logistics of being placed in the Grayson Shelter or Project Roomkey. The social media post ignores this important context. Perhaps most importantly, the story behind this sweep speaks to the broader challenges of accessing housing and services in California. Newsom and other state officials have worked to create new options for unhoused people, such as Project Roomkey, and Newsom’s California Comeback Plan invests $12 billion into tackling homelessness. However, temporary housing often comes with barriers to entry that are insurmountable to unhoused people who have disabilities, are struggling with addiction or are experiencing mental illnesses. Additionally, the California Comeback Plan was just signed this summer, so it’s too early to tell how much of an impact new funding will have. In short, while California officials are working to find solutions to homelessness, they are still a long way from housing and providing services to the state’s vast homeless population.  While some Berkeley encampment residents received housing, we found that several remain on the streets or in temporary residences with high barriers to entry. Therefore, we rate this statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.",/factchecks/2021/sep/11/gavin-newsom/gavin-newsom-showed-encampment-sweep-were-people-l/

Science Does Recommend COVID-19 Vaccine For Young People, Contrary To Larry Elder’s Claim
","Larry Elder, the top GOP candidate in the California recall election, claimed recently that the science is unsettled on whether young people should receive the COVID-19 vaccine or wear masks in schools. ""I don’t believe the science suggests that young people should be vaccinated,"" Elder said in a CNN interview that aired Aug. 31. ""I don’t believe that young people should have to wear masks at school. I’m not sure the science is settled on that at all.""  Elder, a conservative radio talk show host, opposes mask and vaccine mandates and has said he’ll end California’s requirements if elected governor. There’s plenty of debate on whether to mandate these protections. But is the science unsettled on whether young people should receive the vaccine or wear masks at school, as Elder claims?  We found the science is more clear than Elder makes it out to be.  Numerous leading scientific organizations recommend children, ages 12 and up, should receive the vaccine and wear masks at school to protect their health and slow the pandemic.  Groups That Recommend Young People Receive The COVID-19 Vaccine We found the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Federal Drug Administration and the American Academy of Pediatrics all recommend young people receive the COVID-19 vaccine. ""The data continue to show that this vaccine is safe and effective,"" said Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a press release in May. ""I urge all parents to call their pediatrician to learn more about how to get their children and teens vaccinated."" Elder was correct in the CNN interview when he said that children tend to get more mild cases of COVID-19 than adults and are not hospitalized at the same rate. But cases are rising sharply among adolescents as the delta variant spreads across the country.  Nationally, nearly 94,000 child cases of COVID-19 were recorded for the week ending Aug. 5, up from 72,000 cases the week before and up from 39,000 two weeks earlier, NPR reported, based on data from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association. On its website, the CDC recommends ""everyone 12 years and older should get a COVID-19 vaccination to help protect against COVID-19."" It describes the vaccine as  safe and effective, and a critical tool to help stop the pandemic. Timetable For COVID-19 Vaccine For Children Under 12 We also looked at Elder’s claim that he doesn’t ""believe the science suggests"" young people should be vaccinated in the context of children under 12. For this group, we found the examination of vaccine data isn’t complete, but no indication that vaccines will be unsafe for these younger children once authorized.  As many parents of young children know, the COVID-19 vaccine has not yet been authorized for kids under 12 because the FDA is still collecting data to evaluate vaccine safety and effectiveness for these age groups.  In July, the FDA expanded vaccine trials for children under 12 ""to more closely examine rare but serious instances, particularly in young boys, in which the heart muscle becomes inflamed,"" or myocarditis, the Washington Post reported. It said this has pushed the timetable to early 2022.  There have been more than 1,000 reports of cases of myocarditis and pericarditis, a similar condition where the lining of the outside of the heart becomes inflamed, after some COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States, according to the CDC.  ""Considering the hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses that have been administered, these reports are very rare,"" reported Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in a fact sheet about the vaccines for parents. ""The problem occurs more often in adolescents [teens] and young adults, and in males. The myocarditis or pericarditis in almost all cases is mild and resolves quickly."" On its website, the CDC says side effects in adolescents, including possible risk of myocarditis or pericarditis, ""are rare and the known and potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the known and potential risks."" ""COVID-19 vaccines have been used under the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history, which includes studies in adolescents,"" the CDC website adds.  Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, told NPR last month that Pfizer and Moderna ""are still collecting trial data, trying to understand — among other things — whether young children should receive a smaller vaccine dose than what has already been approved for adults."" That indicates work is ongoing to ensure the right dose of the vaccine is authorized for young children. Elder’s claim that the science suggests young people shouldn’t receive the vaccine is not supported.  In May, the FDA approved the COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 12 to 15 on an emergency use basis. The vaccine had been available for everyone age 16 and older in the United States since April.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious-disease expert, recently said that a vaccine could be available to young children ""hopefully by the mid, late fall and early winter.""  The World Health Organization is one leading group that says children should not be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccinations. But as PolitiFact reported in June, that’s not because the WHO takes issue with its safety or effectiveness.  Instead, the WHO believes health care workers, front-line workers, the elderly and those with high-risk medical conditions should be at the front of the line because children develop less severe cases than adults and vaccine supplies are limited in many countries. The Science On Wearing Masks At Schools We also examined Elder’s claim that young people shouldn’t have to wear masks because the science isn’t ""settled"" on that. Again, we found the science is more certain than Elder makes it out to be.  Leading scientific organizations, including the CDC and AAP, recommend students wear masks at schools, saying they reduce the spread of COVID-19.  On its website, the CDC recommends ""universal indoor masking for all teachers, staff, students, and visitors to K-12 schools, regardless of vaccination status.""  It describes mask use as one of several ways to reduce transmission in schools, along with ventilation, hand-washing and physical distancing.  ""Although outbreaks in schools can occur, multiple studies have shown that transmission within school settings is typically lower than – or at least similar to – levels of community transmission, when prevention strategies are in place in schools,"" the CDC reported in July, adding that inconsistent mask use can contribute to outbreaks. Since the start of the pandemic, PolitiFact has examined the science behind using masks to slow transmission and debunked myths about them. It’s found masks are most effective as ""source control,"" which means preventing infected people from spreading the virus to other people.  Now that students are back on campus in California and across the country, health officials say vaccines and universal mask requirements will be key to keeping in-person learning safe and open. ""Masking is likely the second most important thing [behind vaccinations] to prevent transmission and allow children to go to schools and have in-person learning safely,"" said Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Children’s Hospital in Sacramento. Blumberg added that wearing a standard surgical mask or double layer fabric mask reduces a person’s chance of infection by about 70%. ""If you want to avoid having that outbreak that's going to send all the kids home again, you should be doing everything to avoid that. And that means wearing masks,"" Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, added in the NPR interview. In July, California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration issued guidance calling for universal masking at K-12 public schools statewide. Newsom later said it would allow local school districts to decide how to deal with students who refuse to wear a mask, sparking confusion about whether the guidance is a requirement.  Elder’s campaign did not respond to a request for evidence supporting his statement. Our Ruling Larry Elder, the top-polling GOP candidate in the California recall election, claimed the science doesn’t suggest young people should receive the COVID-19 vaccine or wear masks in schools. That’s not supported by the facts. For months, leading scientific groups have offered clear recommendations on these topics. We found the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Federal Drug Administration and the American Academy of Pediatrics all recommend young people, ages 12 and up, receive the COVID-19 vaccine to protect their health and slow the pandemic.  The vaccine has not yet been authorized for children under 12 because more data collection is needed, though health officials expect it will be approved this fall or winter. Elder’s overall statement would have been more accurate had he said the science on the COVID-19 vaccine for children under 12 is incomplete. Instead, he claimed the science suggests young people in general should not be vaccinated, which is wrong.  Additionally, leading health groups including the CDC and AAP recommend students wear masks at schools, saying they reduce the spread of COVID-19.  We rate Elder’s claim False.  FALSE – The statement is not accurate.",/factchecks/2021/sep/11/larry-elder/science-does-recommend-covid-19-vaccine-young-peop/

Claim about Bidens’ ownership in Chinese firm with soaring stock price is False
","A vague attack on ""the Bidens"" claims they own 10% of the Chinese company Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd., and that the company’s stock ""has soared almost 300%"" since Joe Biden was elected. CATL is known as China’s top battery maker and counts electric vehicle maker Tesla among its customers. It has been a hot stock as more automakers shift their attention to electric vehicles. A 10% stake would be worth about $18 billion. The attack, shared in a Facebook post, continues with a conspiracy theory alleging that the Bidens will profit because China has been in talks with the Taliban and will ""take over"" Afghanistan’s market for lithium, which is used in electric vehicle batteries. Biden in August issued an executive order aimed at making half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric. The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence for either part of the claim. No Bidens among largest shareholders: Three individuals own 10% or more of CATL, according to MarketScreener.com, a stock market and financial news website. They are the company’s chairman, Yu Qun Zeng; its vice chairman, Shi Lin Huang; and Chinese billionaire Zhen Hua Pei.  No individual stocks owned by Joe, Jill Biden: Since becoming president, Biden has filed one financial disclosure form for himself and his wife, Jill, on May 17, 2021. Previously, Biden filed a disclosure as a presidential candidate, on May 20, 2020. The forms show that the couple’s investments did not include any individual stocks.  Joe Biden’s son Hunter has been scrutinized for his financial ties to China, but no reports have emerged that he has a large direct stake in CATL. The Wall Street Journal reported in December 2020 that Hunter Biden had a 10% stake in the private-equity firm Bohai Harvest RST (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Co. BHR, founded by a Chinese businessman, invested in CATL and profited from it, but Biden’s lawyer said Biden made no return on his own investment, according to the article.  Stock up 90%, not 300%: CATL shares trade on China’s Shenzhen stock exchange. The closing prices for CATL stock were 256.02 yuan (or about $40) on Nov. 3, 2020, the day of the presidential election; 266.43 yuan on Nov. 9, the first market day after he was declared the winner; and 486.50 yuan on Sept. 3, 2021, the last market day before the image was posted on Facebook. From Nov. 3, 2020, to Sept. 3, 2021, the price increased 90%. In 2020, the year before Biden took office, the stock price tripled.

Problematic study fuels ivermectin sterility claim
","Ivermectin is the latest drug being floated as a treatment against the coronavirus despite warnings from public health authorities and a lack of evidence that it works. But a claim circulating on Facebook says the anti-parasitic drug has the side effect of sterilizing men who take it. An image shared on Facebook shows a man laughing, and on top of the picture is text that reads, ""When you find out Ivermectin sterilizes the majority (85%) of the men who take it. Similar claims have been shared several times across social media as the drug has seen a sharp increase in use. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While the FDA has identified several potential side effects of ivermectin, including nausea, vomiting and dizziness, infertility in men is not listed. The 85% figure comes from a questionable source. The 85% figure cited in the Facebook image and the other social media posts comes from a 2011 study conducted in Nigeria by researchers looking at the effect ivermectin had on fertility in men with onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness. Researchers screened 385 men with the condition, ultimately choosing 37 people to participate in the study as ""their sperm counts were normal while the remaining patients had very low sperm counts."" The men were studied for 11 months as they were treated with the drug, and researchers found a ""significant reduction in the sperm counts and sperm motility of the patients tested."" However, there are several issues with the study. While the study began with 385 men, only 37 ended up being monitored for their ivermectin use — a sample size too small to draw any serious conclusions about the drug's impact on fertility. The study also lacked a control group to see whether it was the drug that had an effect on the men's fertility, or some other factor, such as their river blindness.    The 85% figure was also not the conclusion reached by the study. It was mentioned only in the introduction of the paper as the findings from a separate report of men who were tested outside of the study and found to have ""developed various forms, grades and degrees of sperm dysfunctions."" The journal the study was published in, the Archives of Applied Science Research, claims to be a peer-reviewed, open access journal, but no information could be found on the journal's peer-review process. The publication date of the study could not be found.  Ivermectin tablets are used to treat conditions caused by parasitic worms in humans, such as intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Topical ivermectin is also used for head lice and to treat skin conditions like rosacea. A separate formulation of ivermectin is available for veterinary use, and is used to treat parasites in animals and to help prevent heartworm disease. The United States has recently seen a sharp increase in people using the drug to combat COVID-19. The trend has been fueled by claims that the drug is a miracle treatment for the virus. The FDA, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization have warned against using ivermectin. The drug can negatively interact with other medications and could lead to overdoses if improperly used. ""The FDA has not authorized or approved ivermectin for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 in people or animals,"" the FDA said in a statement. ""Ivermectin has not been shown to be safe or effective for these indications."" Ivermectin use has risen so much that pharmacies across the United States have reported shortages of the anti-parasitic. As a result, more people are buying the animal version of the drug from livestock supply stores, the New York Times reported. The animal version is geared toward larger animals such as horses, and comes in a highly concentrated liquid or paste. A CDC-issued health advisory reported a ""five-fold increase"" in the number of calls made to poison control centers related to misusing ivermectin during July. Several calls involved people who took the animal version of the drug and had an overdose. A Facebook post shared a repeated claim that 85% of men who take ivermectin become sterile. The source for the 85% figure is a study conducted 10 years ago and used a small sample size with no control group to compare the results. The figure also wasn’t the conclusion reached by the study, and was only referenced in the paper as being from a separate report. The peer-review process of the journal the study was published in is also questionable. The anti-parasitic drug has seen increased use during the pandemic as some people claimed it was a miracle treatment for COVID-19. However, there is no proof that ivermectin is effective against the virus.

Nancy Pelosi didn’t ‘block’ members from reading service members’ names, as post claims
","Following a House of Representatives session on Aug. 31, Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., tweeted that Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats refused to read the names of the 13 U.S. service members who were killed in the airport bombing in Afghanistan.    How badly do Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats want to cover up this Afghanistan debacle?They just blocked Members of Congress from reading the names of the service members who sacrificed their lives in Afghanistan last week.Don’t you think our military deserves better? ""How badly do Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats want to cover up this Afghanistan debacle?"" Gimenez wrote. ""They just blocked Members of Congress from reading the names of the service members who sacrificed their lives in Afghanistan last week. Don’t you think our military deserves better?"" The tweet gained widespread traction across social media, including in this Facebook post, which shared a screenshot of a news article touting the claim that Pelosi blocked the reading. A reader asked us if the claim was true. What the claim muddles is that Pelosi wasn’t present at the session at all. A moment of silence to honor the 13 killed had been planned ahead of time and was held during the session. But session rules prohibited action on a new motion, such as one that Republicans say came to the floor requesting that the names be read. Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan presided over the meeting, the congressional record shows. Pelosi appointed Dingell to take her place that day as speaker pro tempore. Mackenzie Smith, spokesperson for Dingell, also confirmed to PolitiFact that Pelosi appointed Dingell as speaker pro tempore and that the meeting was a pro forma session. The session lasted about four minutes, according to the record and C-SPAN video. It included an opening prayer, the Pledge of Allegiance and a moment of silence that lasted about 26 seconds during which those present in the chamber bowed their heads. At the end of the silence, Dingell looked down at the lectern to read aloud the adjourning script and then gaveled the session to an end, only lifting her eyes as she raised the gavel. The video on C-SPAN shows that people shouted out as she lifted and landed her gavel, at which point it appears someone was standing to be recognized.  Pro forma sessions are known for being short. It’s a type of session in which no votes are held, and no formal legislative business is conducted. That means there are no floor resolutions, which are motions to take an action, like the request to read the names of the 13 military members who died.  There are also no free speech periods allowed in a pro forma session, said Donald Wolfensberger, congressional scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and Bipartisan Policy Center fellow. The only exceptions are when majority and minority leaders from both parties have approved a matter of legislative business for the session. ""Any unilateral attempt by any member of either party to depart from that protocol would be gaveled as out of order by the presiding officer who is empowered to declare the House adjourned, without a separate motion or vote on adjournment necessary,"" Wolfensberger said.  According to Robyn Patterson, spokesperson for Pelosi, both parties agreed to a moment of silence for the fallen military members prior to the session, but House Republicans did not make a request to read the names until after the moment of silence was held on the House floor. ""Speaker Pelosi instructed the House of Representatives to hold a moment of silence to honor the brave service members killed in the heinous attack outside Kabul airport,"" Patterson said. ""It’s troubling that these individuals are using service member deaths as an opportunity to spread misinformation and score political points."" PolitiFact reached out to the House Republican Conference for comment, but did not hear back. However, a report from The Floridian, a conservative media site run by a former Republican congressional candidate, quoted Republican Rep. Brian Mast of Florida, who said that House Republicans requested to be recognized after the moment of silence to read the names of the service members. ""They did not acknowledge us, and just closed the House down,"" Mast told The Floridian. Rep. Greg Steube of Florida tweeted a similar statement that the House Democrats refused to recognize Republican veterans on the House Floor. Patterson noted that Pelosi issued an Aug. 31 statement in which she listed the names of the 13 service members and said Congress was praying for ""every life lost."" PolitiFact reached out to the offices of Gimenez, Steube and Mast. None returned our requests for comment.   A Facebook post shared a widespread claim that Pelosi and the Democrats blocked members of Congress on the House floor from reading the names of the 13 U.S. military service members who were killed in Afghanistan.  Congressional records and C-SPAN video show that Pelosi was not at the session, but appointed Dingell to serve as speaker pro tempore that day.  Pro forma sessions are brief, and do not allow votes or legislative business, like new resolutions from the floor, or free speech periods. The only exceptions are when majority and minority leaders from both parties have approved a matter of legislative business for the session. Pelosi’s office said the Republican request wasn’t raised with Democrats before the session.   The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Hurricanes and climate change: Getting to the real numbers
","After President Joe Biden walked through a neighborhood devastated by the remnants of Hurricane Ida in Queens in New York City, he said the evidence is now clear that climate change ""poses an existential threat to our lives.""  ""We’ve got to listen to the scientists and the economists and the national security experts,"" Biden said Sept. 7. ""They’ve been warning us the extreme weather would get more extreme over the decade, and we’re living it in real time now."" A Wall Street Journal columnist wrote that when it comes to hurricanes, too much is made of the climate change effect.  ""Atlantic hurricanes are not becoming more frequent,"" columnist Bjorn Lomborg wrote Sept. 3. ""In fact, the frequency of hurricanes making landfall in the continental U.S. has declined slightly since 1900."" Lomborg continued. ""There aren’t more powerful hurricanes either. The frequency of Category 3 and above hurricanes making landfall since 1900 is also trending slightly down,"" he wrote. Lomborg is a Danish political scientist and president of Copenhagen Consensus Center, a Danish think tank. He has long questioned conventional wisdom on climate change, and his column said improving infrastructure would do more to save lives and property than cutting carbon emissions. The idea that the U.S. is seeing fewer hurricanes, and fewer powerful ones as well, runs counter to the thrust of many news articles. It's fair to say that hurricanes sit in one of the knottier corners of climate change where the trends and underlying forces are tough to untangle. But Lomborg overstates the data. Lomborg cites a 2018 article in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society that had a chart showing a slight decline in the yearly number of hurricanes that hit the U.S. Chart of hurricanes making landfall in the U.S. since 1900 (© American Meteorological Society. Used with permission.) Hurricane activity swings up and down, and the authors use a statistical device to create an overall trend line — the dotted line in the chart. ""I simply show the data of what actually has happened, as documented in the best, peer-reviewed papers, to contrast what many believe from listening to a media filled with hurricane reporting,"" Lomborg told us. Lomborg’s data, though, is more ambiguous than first appears. The study’s authors note that their dotted line is not statistically significant.  One of the authors, Roger Pielke Jr., a political scientist in the University of Colorado’s environmental studies program, affirmed Lomborg’s claim about a slight decline. But he also said the latest U.N. report found ""no trend in the frequency of U.S. landfall events."" A finding of ""no trend"" is not the same as finding a downward trend. The decrease was not meaningful, said Christopher Landsea, National Hurricane Center’s chief of Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch. Researchers in this field emphasize that looking back to 1900, there is no discernable trend, up or down. ""The main takeaway is that there's been no increase in U.S. hurricane numbers,"" Landsea said. Lomborg relies on the same Meteorological Society article to say that the frequency of strong hurricanes — those rated Category 3 or higher — is trending slightly down. But again, the authors of that article said the trend wasn’t statistically significant. With his focus on the havoc wreaked by hurricanes, Lomborg looked only at storms that made landfall in the U.S. But that approach omits a lot of storms from the study of climate change and tropical cyclones. ""One has to remember that only about 12% of all hurricanes occur in the Atlantic and only about a third of those make landfall in the U.S., so he is talking about roughly 4% of all hurricanes,"" said Kerry Emanuel, professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The interplay of all the forces that produce hurricanes are complicated. There are a host of data problems in the historic record, which Lombard acknowledged. The further back you go, the greater the chance that some hurricanes went uncounted, even the ones that hit land. There’s a long-term naturally occurring fluctuation in the waters of the Atlantic that might affect the number of hurricanes — although researchers vigorously debate its role.  Many, though not all, researchers believe that from 1960 to 1980, aerosol pollutants likely counteracted global warming by reducing the sunlight that warmed the ocean. This would mask the impact of greenhouse gases on hurricane trends. When clean air legislation removed those pollutants, greenhouse warming came to the fore. The U.N.’s International Panel on Climate Change wrote in its latest report that there has been an ""observed increase in Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s."" The report also said that there’s no consensus on what lies behind that. Lomborg dismissed the idea that hurricane patterns have changed in the course of a century. But researchers looking at more recent periods, and more than just storms that hit the U.S., have the advantage of much more complete data than is available in the historic record.  A 2019 paper concluded that human-driven climate change likely made Atlantic hurricanes stronger. The authors analyzed changes in wind speed for storms between 1982 and 2009 and found ""significant increases in tropical cyclone intensification rates in the Atlantic basin that are highly unusual.""  They said naturally occurring factors didn’t fully explain the shift. To add to the complexity, climate change pushes hurricane trends both up and down. Greenhouse gases have raised ocean temperatures. By itself, that would lead to more hurricanes. But James Kossin, a senior scientist with the analytics group The Climate Service and a researcher at the University of Wisconsin notes that the same greenhouse gas warming tends to stabilize the atmosphere. ""It suppresses the tropical thunderstorms that would ultimately strengthen to form tropical depressions and then tropical storms and hurricanes,"" Kossin said. ""They can't get off the ground, so to speak."" Many models predict climate change will bring fewer hurricanes, which leads Kossin to minimize the importance of Lomborg’s argument. ""Concentrating on the continental U.S. landfall frequency record has become a bit of a cottage industry for anyone who wants to claim that hurricanes are not linked to climate change,"" Kossin said. ""We're not sure that there will be more storms that form, and there may even be fewer that form, but when they do form, they are more likely to be very dangerous: stronger winds, higher storm surge, more rain and freshwater flooding, slower moving and more likely to stall."" Lomborg said that the frequency and strength of hurricanes hitting the U.S. had declined slightly since 1900. The small shift in some of Lomborg’s sources doesn’t amount to a statistically significant change over the past 120 years. Researchers broadly agree that given all the problems with the historic data, there is no discernable trend either way. Studies of Atlantic storms since 1980, using more robust data, find that the hurricanes that form there tend to be stronger than in the past. Human-driven climate change might play a role, although the science is unsettled. Lomborg focused on a limited number of hurricanes and pushed the data beyond what the research supports.

The Associated Press reported from Moscow in June that 18 Russian regions made vaccinations mandatory for employees in certain sectors, such as government offices, retail, health care, education, restaurants and other service industries; and that Moscow authorities said companies should suspend without pay employees unwilling to get vaccinated. Also in June, Reuters reported that Moscow city authorities ordered mandatory vaccinations for all workers with public-facing jobs — some 2 million people in the city, including hairdressers, retailers, taxi drivers, bank tellers, teachers and performers.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is wrong about pregnancy, abortion timeline
","Texas Gov. Greg Abbott wrongly characterized the timeline of pregnancy, distorting how long a woman would typically know she was pregnant and be able to get an abortion under the state’s new law. A reporter recently asked Abbott about SB 8, the state’s law that bans doctors from providing an abortion after detecting a fetal heart beat. The law has no exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, which went into effect Sept. 1, any person can sue abortion providers or anyone who ""aids and abets"" an abortion. Plaintiffs have the opportunity to win judgments of at least $10,000.  ""Why force a rape or incest victim to carry a pregnancy to term?"" the reporter asked.  Abbott replied: ""It doesn’t require that at all, because obviously it provides at least six weeks for a person to be able to get an abortion."" Abbott then pivoted to vow to ""eliminate all rapists from the streets of Texas.""  Abbott’s statement that women would have at least six weeks to get an abortion drew pushback from abortion rights supporters, who said that the Republican governor was wrong about his pregnancy timeline. We contacted a spokesperson for Abbott to ask for his evidence and did not hear back by our deadline.  Abbott’s comment that a woman would have six weeks to get an abortion distorts the timeline of pregnancy and assumes a woman would know almost immediately after intercourse that she was pregnant.   The law doesn’t state that abortion is banned after six weeks. Instead, the law says that abortion is banned after detection of a fetal heart beat, which is defined as ""cardiac activity or the steady and repetitive rhythimc contraction of the fetal heart within the gestational sac."" The law is named the ""Texas Heatbeat Act,"" but medical experts say that’s a misnomer. ""This is medically inaccurate, because a fetus doesn’t have a developed heart at this time,"" Dr. Kristyn Brandi, board chair of Physicians for Reproductive Health and an abortion provider in New Jersey told PolitiFact. ""What they are referring to is being able to visualize electric activity in the cells that will eventually become a heart."" This visualization of embryonic cardiac activity often is first able to be visualized around six weeks, but it can be seen at times even before that, Brandi told PolitiFact. What people think of as a heartbeat in early pregnancy is actually created by electric impulses that are captured by an ultrasound machine and translated by the machine into the sound of a heartbeat – there are no cardiac valves, so there is no sound of them opening and closing, said  Dr. Nisha Verma, who provides abortion and is a fellow at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a professional organization.  ""Those electric impulses do not make the sound of a heartbeat on their own, nor do they suggest that the heart is now developed,"" Verma said. ""This is not a particularly important part of fetal cardiac development, even though it may be an important moment for my patients who are connecting with their pregnancies."" Multiple experts on pregnancy told us that the length of a woman’s pregnancy is measured from the first day of her last menstrual period.  That means that by the time a woman misses her period, she is already considered four weeks pregnant, Verma said. That leaves women with roughly two weeks to make a decision about their pregnancy and, if they choose to do so, have an abortion. The most sensitive urine pregnancy tests may detect a pregnancy five to seven days before a woman’s first missed period, Verma said. However, doctors recommend that women wait until the first day of their missed period for the most accurate test results.  Not all women realize they are pregnant by that early stage. ""Women with irregular cycles often don't know they are pregnant until later than the six weeks,"" said Dr. John Thoppil, president of the Texas Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Brandi told us in 2019 that most women don’t realize they’re pregnant until missing at least one period. Often, it takes two. While women who are trying to conceive may track their cycles closely and know sooner if they are pregnant, that isn’t generally the case for women whose pregnancies are unintended. In Texas, most patients seeking an abortion must first receive in-person counseling and then wait 24 hours before getting the procedure. The use of telemedicine for medication abortion is prohibited, and insurance policies only cover abortion in limited circumstances, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and policy organization that supports abortion rights and whose research is widely cited.  ""At its most generous interpretation, if a person discovers they are pregnant at exactly four weeks on the dot, that person would only have two weeks to decide if they want an abortion, find a clinic that has capacity to accept patients immediately, schedule two separate appointments, arrange for transportation, time off work, find childcare if needed, and pull together the money to pay for the abortion itself, which is typically around $500 at that point in pregnancy,"" said Liza Fuentes, a senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute. The Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas found in a 2018 survey of 603 abortion patients at 12 facilities that 16% were less than six weeks pregnant at the time of their abortion. In the recent federal court case about the Texas abortion law, a co-medical director of a center that provides abortions said in 2020 about 10% of abortions were for patients up to five weeks and six days from their last menstral period. The U.S. Supreme Court allowed the law to take effect. Abbott said that the new Texas abortion law ""provides at least six weeks for a person to be able to get an abortion."" Abbott’s statement ignores how the pregnancy timeline is calculated. Doctors count pregnancy as starting from the date of a woman’s last period. That means by the time a woman with a regular cycle misses her first period, she is considered four weeks pregnant, which leaves her with two weeks to get an abortion. A woman with an irregular cycle may discover she has even less time. We rate this statement False.

The air we breathe is made up of about 78% nitrogen by volume, 21% oxygen and much smaller amounts of argon, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and other gases.  In the video, the man apparently alludes to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which regulates workplaces. OSHA defines an atmosphere that is less than 19.5% oxygen as oxygen-deficient, and potentially unsafe. So the reference to ""19.5 parts per million"" in the video misstates the safety threshold. That unit of measurement is typically used to describe the concentration of chemical contaminants in water or soil, or trace amounts of a gas; 19.5 ppm is not a plausible reading of oxygen concentration in the atmosphere at a school board meeting.  The other flaw in the demonstration, Neuman explained, is in how the meter is used to generate a reading for oxygen intake.   ""This test does not tell the difference between exhaled air, which is high in carbon dioxide, from inhaled air, which is low in carbon dioxide, because the monitor is under the mask where the child is both inhaling and exhaling,"" Neuman said. ""Holding a meter up to exhaled air would give the result shown. But the mask is porous, and most of the air for each new breath comes in through the mask."" Kirsten Koehler, an environmental health and engineering professor at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, said exhaled breath is only about 16% oxygen, because the body is taking in oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide.  ""When you breathe through the mask, some small volume of air will be left in the mask with this lower concentration at the end of an exhalation. As you inhale, that air is rapidly replaced with fresh air from the room filling your lungs with air at normal oxygen conditions,"" she said. The sensors on the air quality meter ""cannot respond instantaneously to changes in concentration."" A more accurate way to assess the effect of a mask on oxygen flow is to analyze a blood sample, Neuman said. Or, ""a reasonable do-it-yourself test would be to wear a pulse oximeter while wearing a mask or not wearing a mask for longer periods of time, perhaps half an hour each, and then compare oxygen saturation levels."" The test would have to be repeated several times to get an accurate reading. ""Fortunately, this work has already been done quite carefully in several papers, which demonstrated no significant drop in oxygen content or rise in carbon dioxide content when wearing a mask,"" Neuman said. Some experts have argued against mask mandates for children in schools. In a Wall Street Journal opinion article, Dr. Marty Makary, professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and Dr. H. Cody Meissner, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Tufts Children’s Hospital, said masks make it more difficult for some children to learn, and may have negative physical and developmental effects.  ""Any child who wants to wear a mask should be free to do so. But forcing them to make personal, health and developmental sacrifices for the sake of adults who refuse to get immunized is abusive,"" the doctors wrote. ""Before we order the masking of 56 million Americans who are too young to vote and don’t have a lobby, let’s see data showing the benefits and weigh them against the long-term harm."" Research suggests it’s possible that masks could spur social isolation and impede communication, especially for people who are deaf or have trouble hearing. But scientists have found little evidence that the cloth masks worn by most students negatively affect oxygen or carbon dioxide levels. We have previously found concerns about masks and oxygen or carbon dioxide levels to be oversold, as have other fact-checkers.   Studies specific to children have been rare, so most of the scientific literature has involved research on adults. Two studies on children used N95 masks, but even these found no significant impacts on breathing. Other peer-reviewed studies of adults have produced similar results. N95 respirators are hospital-quality masks with a tighter seal and better filtration than ordinary cloth masks and they provide more protection from COVID-19. One paper published in February 2021 looked at 10 previous studies of adults or children that addressed questions of breathing while wearing a mask. The authors expressed disappointment at how few studies looked specifically at the impacts on children, but the paper found little reason for worry.  ""The eight adult studies, including four prompted by the pandemic and one on surgeons, reported that face masks commonly used during the pandemic did not impair gas exchange during rest or mild exercise,"" the authors wrote. A viral video claimed that a demonstration with an air quality monitor showed that cloth masks reduce oxygen levels and are unsafe for children. It’s a new version of a claim that has been repeatedly debunked. The demonstration does not measure what it claims to measure, and studies have repeatedly found that cloth masks do not unsafely reduce oxygen levels. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2021/sep/08/facebook-posts/another-air-quality-monitor-demonstration-fails-sh/
