Education ad is incomplete
","John McCain released an ad this week making the accusation that Barack Obama supports sex education for five-year-olds.
 
Here's what the ad says:
 
""

Education Week

says Obama 'hasn't made a significant mark on education,' that he's 'elusive' on accountability, a 'staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly.'"" As the announcer mentions those last two phrases, ""elusive"" and ""a staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly,"" logos appear of the

Washington Post

for the first phrase and the

Chicago Tribune

for the second.
 
Then the announcer continues: ""Obama's one accomplishment? Legislation to teach 'comprehensive sex education' to kindergartners.
 
Learning about sex before learning to read? Barack Obama. Wrong on education. Wrong for your family.""
 
We looked at the claim about sex ed for kindergartners in a different statement and found it

Pants on Fire!

 
Here, we'll look at what

Education Week

said about Obama.
 

Education Week

did write that Obama ""hasn't made a significant mark on education,"" but the phrase is plucked out of its original context. It's is from a long article written during the Democratic primary that reviewed Obama's positions on education, particularly in comparison with the other Democratic candidates.
 
Here's the full quote:
 
""In his eight years in the state Senate and two years in the U.S. Senate, Mr. Obama hasn't made a significant mark on education policy. In Illinois, his biggest accomplishments were in reforming state ethics rules and capital punishment. He did promote early-childhood initiatives that advocates considered 'innovative and progressive,' said Betsy D. Mitchell, a lobbyist for the Illinois Association for the Education of Young Children.
""His biggest accomplishment in the field was the creation of a state board to oversee the expansion of early-childhood education in the state, Ms. Mitchell said.""
 
So

Education Week

did write the words ""hasn't made a significant mark on education,"" but it was not as disparaging a remark as the ad makes it out to be.
 
The audio portion of the ad is misleading because

Education Week

did not say Obama was ""elusive"" or a ""staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly."" People who only hear the audio portion of the ad will not know that those two phrases are attributed to other publications. And, more significantly, those last two quotes come from opinion columns not news stories, which isn't made clear in the audio or video.
 
The ""elusive"" description is from a July 7, 2008,

Washington Post

editorial that says both candidates have fuzzy education proposals.
 
""Mr. McCain has not been forthcoming with any detailed plan; he is said to be preparing one for the fall. Mr. Obama, as the

New York Times'

David Brooks recently observed, has promised dozens of crowd-pleasing programs but has been elusive on such thorny issues as teacher tenure and school accountability,"" said the editorial.
 
The charge that Obama is a ""staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly"" comes from a

Chicago Tribune

opinion piece by Steve Chapman. That brief quote does accurately capture the substance of Chapman's piece, which criticizes Obama for not embracing school vouchers.
 
The ad gives the idea that

Education Week

doesn't think much of Obama's education policy, and some casual listeners would think all three quotes were from the publication, which is not the case. In fact, two of them come from opinion pieces, a fact that should be made clear so viewers can decide for themselves how to judge them. Only one of the statements accurately captures the sentiments of the article it's taken from. For all of these problems, we rate this statement Barely True.

An absurd claim about a bill that never passed
","
(Published Sept. 11, 2008)
 
John McCain released an ad this week making the accusation that Barack Obama supports sex education for five-year-olds.
 
Here's what the ad says:
 
""

Education Week

says Obama 'hasn't made a significant mark on education,' that he's 'elusive' on accountability, a 'staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly.'
 
""Obama's one accomplishment? Legislation to teach 'comprehensive sex education' to kindergartners.
 
""Learning about sex before learning to read? Barack Obama. Wrong on education. Wrong for your family.""
 
Here, we'll check the claim that Obama wants five-year-olds to learn about sex. We've checked what

Education Week

said in a separate item and found it

Barely True

.
 
The origins of this claim go back to Obama's days as a state senator in the Illinois General Assembly.
 
In 2003, the Assembly considered a bill to expand sex education directives from grades 6 through 12 to grades K through 12. The legislation required the curriculum to be medically accurate and include information on the prevention of HIV and contraceptives. It also said abstinence must be taught and that students ""shall be encouraged to base their actions on reasoning, self-discipline, sense of responsibility, self-control, and ethical considerations, such as respect for oneself and others.""
 
Most pertinent to the kindergarten allegation, the legislation states that ""course material and instruction shall be age and developmentally appropriate.""
 
Carol Ronen, the now-retired state senator who sponsored the bill, said its main intent was to make sure that teenagers got information that was ""medically accurate,"" a requirement that wasn't then part of the school code. A secondary effect was to expand age-appropriate sex education down to lower grades, to allow things like teaching school children to avoid sex predators, Ronen said.
 
""Barack never had anything to do with it,"" she said. ""This is a lot of hoopla.""
 
Obama voted for the legislation in committee on a party-line vote. He was not a sponsor nor a co-sponsor, and the legislation never made it to a full Senate vote. So calling it one of his accomplishments is wrong, since it never became law and it wasn't his bill anyway.
 
This isn't the first time Obama has faced the ""sex ed for kindergartners"" charge. When Obama ran for the U.S. Senate in 2004, his opponent Alan Keyes used it. ""Nobody's suggesting that kindergartners are going to be getting information about sex in the way that we think about it,"" Obama said at a campaign event in 2004. ""If they ask a teacher 'where do babies come from,' that providing information that the fact is that it's not a stork is probably not an unhealthy thing. Although again, that's going to be determined on a case-by-case basis by local communities and local school boards.""
 
Obama said that he did not support telling youngsters about explicit information about sex. The bill specifically mentions that instructional material must be age appropriate. It specifically mentions teaching children how to ""say no to unwanted sexual advances"" and ""nonconsensual physical sexual contact."" The legislation was not sponsored by Obama and it didn't pass, so calling it one of his ""accomplishments"" is absurd. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

Let's ban this list
","
There’s an e-mail circulating around the Internet that purports to be a list of books that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin once tried to have removed from the Wasilla, Alaska, public library shortly after she was elected the city’s mayor in 1996.
 
The title on the e-mail is “The Books Sarah Palin tried to have banned” and it claims to reflect a list taken from the official minutes of the Wasilla Library Board. (

Read it for yourself here.

)
 
The list of 93 books includes such classics as

Death of a Salesman

by Arthur Miller,

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn

by Mark Twain and William Shakespeare's

The Merchant of Venice

; young adult novels such as

Forever

by Judy Blume and

The Chocolate War

by Robert Cormier; even a few Stephen King novels such as

Cujo

and

The Shining

. It's a vitual who's who of frequently banned books.
 
Inundated with questions about the issue, Wasilla Mayor Diane M. Keller released a statement saying, “We have no records of any books being ‘banned or censored’

ever

.”
 
Keller told PolitiFact that city officials scoured board minutes and weren’t able to substantiate that the issue of book removal was ever raised by Palin in a meeting. Nor does Keller, who was a council member at the time, recall any such conversations.
 
We looked into a claim in an e-mail from longtime Wasilla resident Anne Kilkenny, who said that Palin asked the city librarian at a council meeting if she would consider removing books from the library, but that the librarian refused. Palin later said in a local newspaper article that the questions were rhetorical, and that she had no particular books or other material in mind when she posed them. You can read our blow-by-blow account of the issue

here.

 
Kilkenny said she did not recall that any titles were ever mentioned, and the former Wasilla librarian, Mary Ellen Baker, recently told ABC News that she also could not recall that Palin had ever mentioned specific titles.
 
Jeanne Troshynski, president of the Friends of Wasilla Library, said the last formal request to remove a book came in 2005, with the challenge of a book written by Jon Stewart of

The Daily Show

called

America (The Book): A Citizen’s Guide to Democracy Inaction.

That was three years after Palin left office as mayor.
 
Wasilla records show the last formal challenge before that was in 1986 to

Bumps in the Night,

by Harvey Allard — well before Palin’s tenure as mayor. In both cases, the challenges were denied and the books remained on the shelf.
 
June Pinell-Stephens, longtime chair of the Intellectual Freedom Committee of the Alaska Library Association, said she scoured the organization’s archives and could find no record of any formal actions to ban books in Wasilla under Palin’s tenure as mayor.
 
So we can say for certain that no book was ever banned. Nor is there any record that Palin ever initiated a formal process to censor any books, as the e-mail suggests.
 
The 93 titles in the chain e-mail appear to be a generic list of frequently banned books. It was not part of the official minutes of the Wasilla Library Board.
 
In fact, the first book in the Harry Potter series wasn't released in the United States until 1998, two years after this list is alleged to have been generated. In short, the list is a fake. We give the whole e-mail a Pants on Fire.
 

Update:

After this item was posted, a reader pointed out that the list is identical to one posted on an old Web site for Adler and Robin Books, a literary agent and book packager based in Washington D.C. Company President Bill Adler confirmed that he compiled the list of books banned in the United States several years ago and posted it on his company Web site as a public service. Adler said the list was first generated through public records, and then was added onto as readers sent in additional banned titles over the years. Adler said he got a few e-mails last week alerting him that his list had been co-opted. He checked, and the alleged Palin list was identical to his. He said he doesn't know who may have copied and pasted it into the bogus Palin chain e-mail. ""We are now a small footnote in history, I guess,"" Adler said.

If there's lipstick on a pig, it's this McCain ad
","
(Published Sept. 10, 2008)
 
The story begins, like so many these days, with Gov. Sarah Palin’s speech at the Republican National Convention last week. Having stirred the crowd to its feet more than once, Palin delivered a knockout line when she deadpanned:
 
“I love those hockey moms. You know the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? Lipstick.”
 
The line drew cheerful applause and has echoed ever since, which seems to explain how Sen. Barack Obama found himself in the middle of an uproar when he uttered a time-worn phrase to denigrate Sen. John McCain’s proclaimed agenda for “change” in Washington.
 
""John McCain says he's about change, too,"" Obama said. ""And so I guess his whole angle is, 'Watch out, George Bush! Except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy, and Karl Rove-style politics, we're really going to shake things up in Washington.'""
 
""That's not change,"" Obama said. ""That's just calling something the same thing something different. But you know, you can put lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig. You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change, it’s still going to stink after eight years. We’ve had enough of the same old thing.""
 
Gasp! He just said lipstick! Did he just call Sarah Palin a pig??!!!
 
That’s the charge.
 
Later that day, the McCain campaign arranged a conference call for reporters with Jane Swift, the former governor of Massachusetts. She said that when you add up Obama’s comments and Palin’s comments, you get Obama calling Palin a pig. Swift said Obama should apologize.
 
“Calling a very prominent female governor of one of our states a ‘pig’ is not exactly what we want to see,” Swift said.
 
The issue has dominated the presidential campaign for two days, with the McCain campaign stirring a controversy by having local lawmakers call for Obama to apologize, and the Obama campaign responding with examples of how often he and others have used the phrase. The next day, Obama called the McCain’s campaign tactics “lies and phony outrage and Swift-boat politics.”
 
On Wednesday, the McCain campaign released a Web ad called “Lipstick.” It begins with a clip of Palin delivering her lipstick line, then text flashes on the screen saying “Barack Obama on: Sarah Palin.” A moment later, the ad plays a small portion of Obama’s “lipstick on a pig” remark, but not enough of his quotation to make clear what he was talking about. The ad concludes with a clip of CBS anchor Katie Couric soberly remarking on sexism on the campaign trail.
 
The ad has two big problems, as does the complaint of former Gov. Swift. First, in the full text of the remarks it’s clear that Obama isn’t talking about Sarah Palin. He’s talking about McCain’s argument that he represents change.
 
Second, “putting lipstick on a pig” is a popular put-down, especially among politicians. It generally means taking a bad or unattractive idea and trying to dress it up.
 
We weren’t able to pin down the origins of this folksy expression, but we found tons of instances of people using it. The political newspaper

The Hill

labeled the phrase “Congress Speak” back in June, and gave it an official definition: “an expression used to illustrate that something unattractive cannot be beautified or otherwise positively changed by any amount of makeup or other exterior alterations.”
 
In 1986, Texas Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower used the phrase to criticize Ronald Reagan’s farm policy. During the 2004 presidential campaign, both Dick Cheney and John Edwards used it to attack the other guy’s running mate. Earlier this year, Democratic Congresswoman Linda Sanchez of California gave a speech on trade policy. “You know the old saying about putting lipstick on a pig? Well, I smell bacon,” she groused.
 
Obama and McCain both have used the expression.
 
In September 2007,

Washington Post

columnist Eugene Robinson quoted Obama using the phrase to discuss Iraq policy:
 
“I think that both Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are capable people who have been given an impossible assignment,” Obama said. “George Bush has given a mission to Gen. Petraeus, and he has done his best to try to figure out how to put lipstick on a pig.”
 
In Iowa on Oct. 11, 2007, McCain panned Sen. Hillary Clinton’s health care plan, calling it “eerily reminiscent” of the plan that failed during Bill Clinton’s administration, according to a report in the Chicago Tribune.
 
“I think they put some lipstick on a pig,” McCain said, “but it’s still a pig.”
 
On Feb. 1, 2007, McCain blasted a Senate resolution that would have criticized President Bush’s strategy in Iraq. Some had praised the resolution as a compromise measure, but McCain disagreed. “It gets down to whether you support what is being done in this new strategy or you don’t,” McCain said. “You can put lipstick on a pig, [but] it’s still a pig, in my view.”
 
It is simply impossible to view the complete remarks by Obama and conclude that he’s making a veiled and unsavory reference to Palin. Her name never is used in the preceding sentence. In fact, it’s hard to see how one could interpret Obama’s lipstick-on-a-pig remark as referring directly to McCain, either. We think it’s very clear that Obama was saying McCain’s effort to call himself the “candidate of change” is like putting lipstick on a pig, trying to dress up a bad idea to look better. Agree or disagree with Obama’s point, but his remark wasn’t the smear that McCain’s people have tried to make it.
 
If anyone’s doing any smearing, it’s the McCain campaign and its outrageous attempt to distort the facts. Did Obama call Palin a pig? No, and saying so is Pants on Fire wrong.

Numbers right, context missing
","In a widely circulated e-mail written by Wasilla resident Anne Kilkenny, she challenged Gov. Sarah Palin's portrait as a fiscal conservative when she ran the city of Wasilla, Alaska, as its mayor from 1996 to 2002.
 
In Kilkenny's e-mail, she highlights several budget statistics to make her point. (

Read it for yourself here.

)
 
We'll take them one by one, and then get to some counterpoint arguments from current Wasilla Mayor Dianne M. Keller.
 
• ""Sarah campaigned in Wasilla as a 'fiscal conservative.' During her 6 years as mayor, she increased general government expenditures by over 33 percent.""
 
According to figures provided by the city of Wasilla, the operating budget for Wasilla went from $6,050,160 in fiscal year 1996 to $9,393,768 in 2002. That's a 55 percent increase. But adjusted for inflation, it's a 35 percent increase.
 
• ""During those same 6 years the amount of taxes collected by the city increased by 38 percent.""
According to a review of Wasilla's financial reports, the amount of revenue taken in during 1996 was $6,070,806; and rose to $8,710,166 in 2002. That's a 43 percent increase. Adjusted for inflation, that comes to a 25 percent increase.
 
• ""She reduced progressive property taxes and increased a recessive sales tax which taxed even food.""
 
Under Palin, property tax rates did, in fact, go down; and the sales tax did go up from 2 percent to 2.5 percent. And yes, the sales tax includes food (though there are exemptions for such things as medicine).
 
• ""The huge increases in tax revenues during her mayoral administration weren't enough to fund everything on her wish list though, borrowed money was needed, too. She inherited a city with zero debt, but left it with indebtedness of over $22-million. What did Mayor Palin encourage the voters to borrow money for? Was it the infrastructure that she said she supported? The sewage treatment plant that the city lacked? Or a new library? No. $1-million for a park, $15-million-plus for construction of a multi-use sports complex...She also supported bonds for $5.5-million for road projects that could have been done in 5-7 years without any borrowing.""
 
The city of Wasilla has made available all of its budgets during Palin's tenure. So we grabbed the fiscal year ending 1996 (when Palin took the reins), which showed the city's long-term debt at $1.12-million, mostly for paving and sewer projects.
 
The annual financial report for fiscal year ending June 30, 2002 — Palin's last year in office — shows that the total long-term debt was $24.8-million. So Kilkenny is off a bit when she says long-term debt went from zero to $22-million. But it did increase $23.7-million.
 
And Kilkenny is also correct about the big-ticket items that created the debt: $14.7-million for a new multi-use sports complex; $5.5-million for street projects; and $3-million for water improvement projects.
 
Factually, Kilkenny's claims about the budget are true. But the conclusions that Kilkenny reaches are a matter of debate.
 
Current Mayor Diane M. Keller, who served on the City Council when Palin was mayor, said just presenting those raw figures is misleading.
 
Yes, she said, Wasilla's budgets increased and tax receipts went up under Palin's reign, but much of that was due to the growth of the city during those six years.
 
Yes, she said, the sales tax rate went from 2 percent to 2.5 percent under Palin, but that was approved via voter referendum, with the extra proceeds earmarked specifically to pay off that sports complex. CBS News reported that the referendum on the sports complex passed by just 20 votes.
 
Due to the economic growth in the community, Keller said, Wasilla is going to be able to stop charging that extra .5 percent sales tax two years earlier than anticipated.
 
The property tax rate was reduced under Palin from 2 mills to .5 mills (it was later eliminated under Keller).
 
Voters also okayed the bond issue to pay for road improvements, Keller noted.
 
""The people in our community wanted road improvements,"" Keller said. ""The taxpayers voted on it. Same thing with the sports complex. It's up to us to do what the people are asking for.""
 
The U.S. Census does not provide yearly population estimates before 2000, but Wasilla's population grew by about 13 percent in the last two years of Palin's mayorship alone. It stands to reason that a town's budget will grow as the population rises.
 
And if voters okayed the bond issues for the sports complex and road projects, as well as for the sales tax increase, we think it's a little misleading to pin them entirely on the mayor, even if she did lobby for them. But Kilkenny's numbers are mostly accurate, so we rule her statements about Wasilla's finances under Palin Mostly True.

He butted heads with Big Pharma
","Next to Big Oil, few businesses make more convenient political punching bags than drug companies. Anecdotes about cash-strapped seniors cutting their pills in half or crossing the border to Canada or Mexico to fill prescriptions have provided red meat for campaigns at the national and local levels. Now John McCain's campaign is joining in.
 
An ad unveiled Sept. 8, 2008, portrays McCain and running mate Sarah Palin as mavericks willing to take on all comers. Over still photos of the pair, an announcer describes how each stood up to members of their own party and enumerates various reform efforts. A few — ""He fights pork barrel spending"" (

We found a few blips on the record),

""She stopped the 'Bridge to Nowhere,' ""

(She didn't kill it, she performed last rites),

""She Took on Big Oil""

(Yes, she did),

— we've ruled on previously.
 
One claim was new: ""He took on the drug industry."" We wondered if McCain really did battle Big Pharma.
 
Though he isn't often associated with health care issues, McCain sounded a bit like Hillary Rodham Clinton last year when he assailed drugmakers for profiteering. He even took a swat at the industry during a Jan. 5 Republican debate in New Hampshire, when Mitt Romney defended drugmakers against criticism by other GOP presidential aspirants, by saying, ""Don't turn this pharmaceutical manufacturers into the big bad guys,"" and McCain interjected, ""Well, they are.""
 
In the Senate, McCain has backed up that belief by pushing legislation to liberalize drug importation and expand the availability of lower-cost generic drugs, each of which would cut into name-brand pharmaceutical manufacturers' profits — and that prompted strenuous opposition from the companies. Each of the efforts also involved working across the aisle with Democrats.
 
In 2001, for example, McCain and Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., collaborated on legislation that would have rewritten patent law to make it more difficult for brand-name drugmakers to stave off competition from generic versions once their original patents have expired. The measure came at a time of mounting public criticism over drug prices but triggered strong resistance from mostly Republican critics, who said the effort would discourage research spending by big drug manufacturers. McCain and Schumer's measure passed the Senate by a 78-21 margin in 2002 but was never taken up by the House. The Bush administration eventually confronted the ongoing buzz about drug pricing by proposing a Food and Drug Administration rule to shorten the time that brand-name drugmakers can market drugs without competition from cheaper generic competitors.
 
In 2003, McCain again went against the wishes of drugmakers by opposing a sweeping Medicare package that created first-time outpatient prescription drug coverage for seniors. McCain objected to the costs associated with providing coverage to each of the program's more than 40-million beneficiaries, and had he and like-minded lawmakers prevailed, coverage likely would have been limited to lower-income populations.
 
In 2004, McCain waded into another sensitive issue for the drug industry, when he joined with the likes of Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., to push legislation that would allow prescription drugs to be imported from Canada, where price controls keep costs down. (The federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act bars drug importation except by the manufacturer and stipulates that the products can be dispensed only with a prescription).
 
Like the generic drug bill, this measure also picked up substantial bipartisan support, along with the backing of seniors lobby AARP, but ran into resistance from the drug industry and Bush administration, which argued it could open the U.S. market to a flood of dangerous or counterfeit medicines. Senate Republican leaders — who controlled the chamber at the time and wanted to avoid sending President Bush a popular bill he might have to veto in the middle of an election campaign — didn't allow the measure to come up for a vote.
 
Joe Antos, a health policy scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said McCain's legislative stands showed a clear willingness to confront the drug industry but added that they stem as much from the Arizona senator's broader concern about industries' potential to game government policies for profit as from any particular beef he has with drugmakers. Antos said a McCain administration probably would be less receptive to pharmaceutical industry entreaties for streamlined regulations or other favorable policies than the Bush administration has.
 
""His natural skepticism would come right to the front,"" Antos said.
 
Democrats contend that even while McCain was promoting politically appealing proposals to deal with drug costs, he was quietly doing the industry favors with respect to advertising regulations and how much it can charge government programs for its products.
 
Barack Obama's campaign, in a rebuttal to the Sept. 8 ad, notes that during the 2003 debate on the Medicare drug benefit, McCain voted with the majority of the Senate against an amendment that would have required drugmakers to release advertising with balanced information or be subject to civil penalties.
 
During the 2002 generic drug debate, McCain voted against an amendment that was adopted by the Senate that allowed states to use their volume purchasing power to buy lower-priced drugs for uninsured people who don't qualify for Medicaid. And in 1995, he voted against offering drug discounts to state Medicaid programs and public health facilities during a debate on balanced-budget legislation.
 
These votes might indeed have helped the drug industry at crucial times. But they were on narrow amendments to broader bills and are not as significant as McCain's stands on importation and generics, which prompted stiff resistance from big, name-brand drug companies and their allies in Congress. McCain can rightly claim that he confronted drug companies on sensitive issues that affected its bottom line. For this reason, we rule his statement Mostly True.

However, loyalty was the overriding issue
","
A chain e-mail making the rounds claims to offer an insider's look at Sarah Palin during her days as mayor of Wasilla. The copy of the e-mail we've received is genuine. It was written by Wasilla resident Anne Kilkenny, a homemaker and longtime observer of Wasilla municipal government.
 
Kilkenny makes numerous factual claims in her e-mail. (

Read it for yourself here.

) Here, we are checking her statement that Palin ""fired Wasilla's Police Chief because he 'intimidated' her, she told the press.""
 
There is no doubt that Palin fired the top cop of Wasilla in early 1997, a few months after taking office. Multiple news reports and a federal lawsuit confirm this.
 
The

Anchorage Daily News

reported that Palin delivered letters to Police Chief Irl Stambaugh and City Librarian Mary Ellen Emmons on Jan. 30, 1997, saying their employment with the city would end. The reports said Palin took the action because she felt the two did not fully support the changes that she wanted to make as the newly elected mayor. Both Stambaugh and Emmons had publicly supported Palin's political opponent, incumbent mayor John Stein, in the 1996 mayoral campaign, the reports noted.
 
The day after notifying them of their dismissals, however, Palin changed her mind about the city librarian and allowed her to stay.
 
She did not change her mind about Stambaugh, though. He decided to sue the city in federal court for wrongful termination.
 
Palin wrote a memo to Stambaugh and his attorney on Feb. 7, 1997, outlining in greater specificity the reasons she fired Stambaugh. The memo, stamped ""confidential,"" is part of the case file from the lawsuit, portions of which the

Seattle Times

posted online after Palin was named the Republican vice presidential nominee.
 
Palin

reiterates in the memo

that she did not feel like she had Stambaugh's ""full support"" after working with him for 3 months. She outlined a number of instances in which he either disagreed with her or was reluctant to implement her directions.
 
According to Palin's memo, Stambaugh refused to search his budget for areas to be cut. He also was reluctant to provide her with weekly memos on ""positive things"" that were happening in his department. He failed to tell her about a meeting that she had been expected to attend. He spoke with a ""disrespectful and condescending"" tone at staff meetings.
 
""When I met you in private,"" Palin wrote, ""instead of engaging in interactive conversation with me, you gave me short, uncommunicative answers and then you would sit there and stare at me in silence with a very stern look, like you were trying to intimidate me.""
 
Stambaugh's lawsuit was not successful, because the court found Palin had the right to terminate Stambaugh for any reason she wished.
 
The e-mail says Palin ""fired Wasilla's Police Chief because he 'intimidated' her, she told the press."" Not all of Wasilla's press coverage from that time (particularly the archives of Wasilla's newspapaper

The Frontiersman

) is available online, so we can't say for sure that Palin did or did not say that. Palin's memo from the lawsuit is convincing evidence that she felt Stambaugh tried to intimidate her.
 
The main reason Palin fired Stambaugh appears to be for issues of loyalty and support, as outlined in her memo, but it also specifically mentions intimidation. We find the statement that Palin fired Wasilla's Police Chief because he 'intimidated' her to be Mostly True.

Story of banned books is murky
","
One of the most potent claims in an e-mail written by Wasilla, Alaska, resident Anne Kilkenny is that when Sarah Palin was mayor, she tried to have some books removed from the city library.
 
Here's how the claim reads in Kilkenny's e-mail:
 
""While Sarah was Mayor of Wasilla she tried to fire our highly respected City Librarian because the Librarian refused to consider removing from the library some books that Sarah wanted removed.

The most definitive record for much of this issue comes from a Dec. 18, 1996, article in the Wasilla newspaper, the

Frontiersman.

 
In that story, Wasilla library director Mary Ellen Emmons (now Mary Ellen Baker) said that after Palin was elected mayor, she twice inquired about censoring library books.
 
""I'm not trying to suppress anyone's views,"" Emmons told the

Frontiersman.

""But I told her (Palin) clearly, I will fight anyone who tries to dictate what books can go on the library shelves.""
 
""This is different than a normal book-selection procedure or a book-challenge policy,"" Emmons said. ""She was asking me how I would deal with her saying a book can't be in the library.""
 
Palin told the

Frontiersman

that she had no particular books or other material in mind when she posed the questions to Emmons.
 
In a written statement to the newspaper, Palin ""said she was only trying to get acquainted with her staff"" and that the question was ""rhetorical.""
 
Also from the story:
 
""Emmons said Palin asked her on Oct. 28 if she would object to censorship, even if people were circling the library in protest about a book. 'I told her it would definitely be a problem the ACLU would take on then,' Emmons said.
 
""Asked who she thought might picket the library, Palin said Monday, 'Had no one in mind ... again, the issue was discussed in the context of a professional question being asked in regards to library policy.' ""
 
In an interview with PolitiFact, Kilkenny said the issue also came up at a council meeting soon after Palin took office in 1996.
 
Time has passed, Kilkenny said, and she can't remember the exact words, but she said Palin asked Emmons something like, ""What would your response be to my request to remove books from the library collection?""
 
""I remember being shocked at the implication,"" Kilkenny said.
 
She said that there was a long pause of silence, and that Emmons responded that books were selected in line with national criteria for a library its size. Kilkenny said she remembered Emmons concluded firmly: ""I would absolutely not comply with your request.""
 
Kilkenny said Palin's request didn't sound rhetorical to her.
 
The conversation between Palin and Emmons came the same week that Palin requested resignations from all the city department heads as a test of loyalty, the

Frontiersman

noted. Emmons, a popular librarian who was then president of the Alaska Library Association, did not resign. On Jan. 30, 1997, about six weeks after the story appeared, Palin told Emmons and the police chief that she was dismissing them. The next day, Palin changed her mind about Emmons and let her stay on. Emmons finally resigned in August 1999. (

See our ruling on the e-mail's claim about the police chief here.

)
 
We can say for certain that no book was ever banned. Nor is there any record that Palin initiated a formal process to censor any books.
 
June Pinell-Stephens, longtime chair of the Intellectual Freedom Committee of the Alaska Library Association, said she scoured the organization's archives and could find no record of any formal actions to ban books in Wasilla under Palin's tenure as mayor.
 
That jibes with Wasilla Library records as well.
 
""We have no records of any books being 'banned or censored' ever,"" Wasilla Mayor Diane M. Keller said in a statement released about the issue.
 
Keller told PolitiFact that the city hasn't been able to find any minutes to substantiate that the issue was ever raised by Palin at a City Council meeting. Nor does Keller, who was a council member at the time, recall any such conversations.
 
Jeanne Troshynski, president of the Friends of Wasilla Library, said the last formal request to remove a book came in 2005, with the challenge of a book written by Jon Stewart of

The Daily Show

called

America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction.

That was three years after Palin left office as mayor.
 
Wasilla records show the last formal challenge before that was in 1986 to

Bumps in the Night,

by Harvey Allard — well before Palin's tenure as mayor. In both cases, the challenges were denied and the books remained on the shelf.
 
But Kilkenny's e-mail doesn't claim that Palin initiated a formal process to ban books. In fact, Kilkenny said she does not recall that Palin even mentioned specific books that she wanted banned.
 
And Emmons, now Mary Ellen Baker, isn't talking.
 
A message on her answering machine states: ""I have nothing to add to reports from that time. I do not want to discuss the matter. Please respect my privacy.""
 
But the

Frontiersman

reporter who wrote that article in 1996 now says Emmons told him Palin did mention three books that she wanted removed from the shelves.
 
Paul Stuart is semiretired, though he still occasionally contributes articles to a weekly paper, the

Mountain Ear,

in Conway, N.H., where he lives.
 
Stuart told PolitiFact that in a conversation with Emmons after his article ran, she listed three titles. He said he could recall only two, and initially said they were

I Told My Parents I'm Gay

and

I Asked My Sister.

We looked for these titles; they don't appear to exist.
 
""Mary Ellen told me that Palin asked her directly to remove these books from the shelves,"" Stuart said. ""She refused.""
 
Asked later if the first book could have been

Pastor, I am Gay,

a controversial book written by a pastor who lives just outside Wasilla, Stuart said that was it.
 
Howard Bess, author of

Pastor, I am Gay

and former pastor of Church of the Covenant in nearby Palmer, recalls that his book challenging Christians to re-examine their ideas about and prejudices against gays and lesbians was not well received in Wasilla when it was published in 1995 — the year before Palin was elected mayor.
 
Virtually every book store in Wasilla refused to sell it.
 
Bess said he gave two copies to the Wasilla Library, but they quickly disappeared. So he donated more copies.
 
The controversy over the book was part of the context of that time period, he said. ""Knowing Sarah's religious connections and the people involved, I would be surprised if my book was not one of those at issue,"" Bess said. ""But I don't know that for a fact.""
 
""I don't think anyone has the facts except Mary Ellen, and she ain't talking,"" Bess said.
 
In addition to Kilkenny's e-mail, there is another one circulating widely with the subject line, ""The Books Sarah Palin tried to have banned."" It purports to be a list taken from the official minutes of the Wasilla Library Board. (

Read it for yourself here.

)
 
The 93 titles appear to be a generic list of frequently banned books. It was not part of the official minutes of the Wasilla Library Board.
 
In fact, the Harry Potter series listed didn't even begin until 1998, two years after this list is alleged to have been generated. In short, the list is a fake.
 
As for Kilkenny's claim, there is no proof that Palin tried to fire the librarian because she refused to consider removing books. In fact, Palin asked for the resignation of a handful of department heads to test their loyalty, according to reports at the time. The claim that Palin had specific books she wanted removed is also unsupported. Kilkenny herself said she does not recall that any titles were named by Palin at the time.
 
Yes, a reporter provides a secondhand account 12 years later in which he says the librarian named books Palin wanted removed. But Stuart's recollection seems hazy (he didn't get the right title at first). The librarian isn't talking. There are no public records or meeting minutes to substantiate the claim. And no one else corroborates that Palin ever listed any titles. So we find no basis to find that part of the story true.
 
But Palin did ask the librarian if she would consider removing books. Maybe it was posed as a rhetorical question as Palin says. But she asked. So we rule the statement Half True.

"['National', 'Transportation', 'John McCain']","
A bridge to exaggeration
","
In the 10 days since Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was named John McCain's running mate, the McCain campaign has portrayed her final blow against the Bridge to Nowhere as a prime example of her opposition to wasteful spending and her willingness to challenge the status quo.
 
""I told the Congress 'thanks, but no thanks,' on that Bridge to Nowhere,"" Palin said at the Republican National Convention. Now comes the McCain campaign with a new TV ad that makes the same claim, even more boldly.
 
""She stopped the Bridge to Nowhere,"" the ad says, as the screen shows a photo of a stern-looking Palin superimposed on an aerial picture of blue water and islands.
 
We've addressed the bridge claim twice before, giving her a

Full Flop

for having first supported the bridge before opposing it, and a

Half True

for her original ""thanks-but-no-thanks"" claim. But since the campaign is making an even stronger boast with this TV ad, we are going to address it separately here.
 
First, we should point out that the ad is misleading because it appears to justify the claim with a newspaper article on the screen. ""PALIN FLIES HIGH AS A REFORMER,"" says the headline from the

Anchorage Daily News

that scrolls onto the screen as the announcer says ""she stopped the Bridge to Nowhere.""
 
We think many viewers will get the impression that the

Anchorage Daily News

article backs up the claim. But alas, it is TV ad sleight-of-hand. The article merely says she ""ordered her administration to seek fewer congressional earmarks"" after the bridge became a symbol of pork-barrel spending. There are no other details about the project or her role in ending it.
 
The bridge, estimated to cost nearly $400-million, was to connect the city of Ketchikan (population 8,200) to Gravina, an island with just 50 residents but also an airport, and only accessible by a five-minute ferry ride.
 
The project came into national prominence when Taxpayers for Common Sense, an advocacy group that opposes wasteful spending, cited it as an extreme example of pork-barrel spending. The bridge's national notoriety was cemented with a

Parade

magazine cover story that ran Nov. 6, 2005, under the headline, ""Are Your Tax Dollars Being Wasted?""
 
The project also raised bitter debate in Congress, and several attempts were made to yank funding for the project. In the fall of 2005, Congress removed the language specifically directing money to the bridge, but it kept the funding in place and left it up to Alaska to decide which transportation projects the state would like to spend it on. (Alaskans could have built the Bridge to Nowhere, but they no longer were required to, as had previously been the case.)
 
By the time Palin pulled the plug on the Gravina bridge project in September 2007, much of the federal funding for the bridge had already been diverted to other transportation projects. The bridge would cost $398-million, Palin said then, and Alaska was $329-million short.
 
""Ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport, but the $398-million bridge is not the answer,"" Palin said. ""Despite the work of our congressional delegation, we are about $329-million short of full funding for the bridge project, and it's clear that Congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between Ketchikan and Gravina Island.""
 
Lois Epstein, director of the Alaska Transportation Priorities Project, which opposed funding for the Gravina bridge, said while it's true that Palin formally put an end to the project, ""It wasn't really a bold move when she did it.""
 
Although the project had local support in Ketchikan, Epstein said, it was not a popular project around the state. Had Palin decided to continue the bridge project, Epstein said, it would have required either a lot more federal funding — which clearly was no longer supported in Congress — or for the state to pick up the bulk of the tab, at the expense of other more urgent road projects.
 
Keith Ashdown, a spokesman for Taxpayers for Common Sense, believes Palin has ""hyperinflated her role"" in killing the project.
 
""She put the final stake in the project,"" Ashdown said. ""But there was already tremendous momentum for the project to be scrapped. She gets credit for saying that they were not to go forward with the bridge, but it was at death's door.""
 
So, no, Palin wasn't the only one who stopped the bridge. The project was facing nationwide opposition and the state, which could have built the bridge anyway, had already spent much of the money on higher priorities. Palin didn't kill it, she just performed the last rites. And the ad is misleading because it cites a newspaper article that doesn't provide any evidence that the boast is accurate. So we rate the claim in the ad to be Barely True.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Joe Biden']","
100-million people is more accurate
","Joe Biden accepted his party's nomination to be vice president at the Democratic National Convention in Denver and used his acceptance speech to attack Republican John McCain's economic policies.
 
""John thinks that during the Bush years we've made great progress economically. I think it's been abysmal,"" Biden said in his speech on Aug. 27, 2008.
 
McCain proposes tax breaks for ""the largest companies in the nation, but no — none — no relief for 100-million American families. That's not change; that's more of the same,"" Biden said.
 
Here, we're checking Biden's claim that McCain's plan provides ""no relief for 100-million American families.""
 
We checked with the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group that has extensively analyzed the tax proposals of both presidential candidates.
 
Both McCain and Obama propose extending the Bush tax cuts to some extent. McCain wants the tax cuts extended for all income levels, while Obama wants the tax cuts extended for only those making less than about $250,000.
 
Besides those extensions, McCain also proposes increasing the exemption for dependents like children. Obama, on the other hand, offers a tax credit of about $500 per person for people who work. Because more people work than claim dependents, Obama's plan tends to impact more people.
 
The question here is how many people get no reduction in taxes under McCain's proposals. Using the current tax policies as a baseline, McCain's proposals would mean about 44 percent of tax units would not get a tax reduction in 2009, and about 46 percent would get no tax reduction in 2012, according to the center's analysis. A ""tax unit"" is a technical term for a typical tax return. A single person is one tax unit, and a married couple filing jointly counts as one unit.
 
There are about 150-million tax units filing annually. So between 66-million and 69-million tax units will receive no tax reduction under the McCain plan, according to the center.
 
But Biden said 100-million American

families

. We're guessing that Biden may have inflated a claim made in

an earlier Obama ad

that said ""100-million

Americans

will get no tax relief at all.""
 
Biden would have made a better case if he had said 100-million people get no tax reduction, because a tax unit can represent more than one person. But in many cases, one family will equal one tax unit. The analysis we use shows between 66-million and 69-million tax units will not see a reduction under the McCain plan. Because the numbers fall short of Biden's statement of 100-million families, we rule it only Half True.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Barack Obama']","
Trend is right but numbers are wrong

","
In making his case for the presidency at the Democratic National Convention, Barack Obama cited statistics to argue that Americans have lost economic ground during the Bush administration.
 
""We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage, whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma,"" Obama said in Denver on Aug. 28, 2008. ""We measure progress in the 23-million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was president, when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.""
 
We looked up the income numbers to see what happened to incomes during the Clinton years. We found Obama is correct that incomes went up under Clinton but dropped under Bush. But the numbers he uses aren't right.
 
We looked to the U.S. Census report

Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2007.

Numbers in the report are adjusted for inflation and reflect 2007 dollar values. The report indicates that median household income during the Bush administration dropped from $50,557 in 2000 to $50,233 in 2007, a decline of $324. Under Bill Clinton, median household income rose from $44,359 in 1992 to $50,557 in 2000, an increase of $6,198.
 
The Obama campaign uses different numbers to calculate income. They look at households in which the age of the householder is under age 65. The campaign believes this more accurately reflects earnings power for workers, because seniors have Social Security income that automatically rises with inflation.
 
During the course of our research, we found a commentary written by one of Obama's economic advisers that cited the numbers Obama used, with the caveat that it applied to ""working-age households."" That would leave out seniors, and could conceivably change the numbers we found in the census. (The article didn't include a citation.) Obama didn't use the ""working-age"" caveat in his speech.
 
Using those numbers, inflation-adjusted income goes from $51,039 in 1992 to $58,555 in 2000 to $56,545 in 2007. That comes to a drop of $2,010 during the Bush administration and an increase of $7,516 during the Clinton administration. (Note if you want to do your own calculations at home: Pull them from Census reports from the respective years, then use the more technical CPI-U-RS inflation calculator found

here

.)
 
Having said all that, Obama didn't mention working-age families as part of his speech.
 
Obama is right with the overall point he's making. Incomes did rise under Clinton and decline under Bush. But the numbers he uses don't include seniors, who today represent about 12 percent of the population. So we rate his statement only Half True.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Joe Biden']","
It's not quite that simple
","Ah, the catchphrase. It sounds so simple and so outrageous. ""Tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas.""
 
Democrats use the line frequently, and vice presidential nominee Joe Biden offered a version of it to attack John McCain during his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention: ""Millions of Americans have seen their jobs go offshore, yet John continues to support tax breaks for corporations that send them there,"" Biden said.
 
The way Biden says it, it sounds like McCain wants to offer a special tax break for companies to move jobs offshore. Right?
 
That's not quite how it works. So what is Biden talking about?
 
Bear with us here, because this requires a quick explanation of the international corporate tax system.
 
U.S.-based corporations are required to pay U.S. corporate income taxes on all of their profits, no matter where in the world those profits are earned. Companies operating overseas pay taxes to foreign countries. Then, if the amount they paid is less than what they would have owed on domestic profits, they pay the remainder to the United States.
 
For example, if a company earns $1 million in Ireland, which has a 12.5 percent corporate tax rate, it pays $125,000 to Ireland. Then, because the U.S. corporate tax rate is 35 percent, the company would owe an additional $225,000 to the United States. (This example is deliberately oversimplified, and U.S. companies often have tax breaks that reduce their real tax rates below 35 percent.)
 
But there's a catch. The company only pays that $225,000 when it brings the profits back to the United States. If the profits remain overseas, the company gets to defer taxation indefinitely. Deferral is a powerful incentive, and the ability to pay taxes later on income earned now is what makes 401(k) plans so attractive to individuals. Deferral also helps U.S. companies compete overseas, because they don't immediately face higher taxes than their foreign-based competitors.
 
However, Democrats argue, that ability to defer taxes encourages companies to locate jobs overseas and keep their profits there, and that's a logical argument. Of course, there are plenty of nontax reasons why companies might operate internationally, such as cheaper labor, access to foreign markets and proximity to raw materials.
 
Got all that? So let's come back to Biden's statement: What does McCain believe?
 
In a recent campaign ad, the Obama campaign refers to a 2004 Senate vote on the issue. Sixty senators, including McCain and eight Democrats, voted to kill a proposal that would have required companies to pay taxes when they import goods produced in their foreign factories. The measure would have limited, though not eliminated the tax deferral.
 
During his presidential campaign, McCain has taken a different approach to international taxes. He argues that the current tax system puts U.S. companies at a disadvantage, and has proposed lowering the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent.
 
Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO who advises McCain on economic policy, argued that there is no tax break for companies to move jobs overseas. ""If the tax rate were lowered on businesses in this country, businesses would bring money back,"" she said on ABC. ""The reason they cannot bring money back is because the tax rate is so high.""
 
As a side note, Obama has not been clear about what limits he would place on deferral of income earned overseas. In a recent conference call with reporters, campaign economic adviser Austan Goolsbee said the magnitude or length of deferral could be curtailed, but the campaign has not released a detailed plan.
 
Does John McCain support tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas? Not really. He supports retaining a long-standing principle of the U.S. tax system that encourages some companies to move operations overseas. The world is far more complicated than Biden's catchphrase makes it seem, and that makes his argument Barely True.

History notes elder McCain's passing
","In his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minn., presidential nominee John McCain made the case for the presidency, describing his policy positions and contrasting himself to Democratic nominee Barack Obama.
 
He also discussed his life story as a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, and his family's long history of military service.
 
""When I was 5 years old, a car pulled up in front of our house,"" McCain said. ""A Navy officer rolled down the window, and shouted at my father that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. I rarely saw my father again for four years. My grandfather came home from that same war exhausted from the burdens he had borne, and died the next day. In Vietnam, where I formed the closest friendships of my life, some of those friends never came home with me. I hate war. It is terrible beyond imagination.""
 
McCain writes extensively about the grandfather — they share the same name, John Sidney McCain — in his memoir

Faith of My Fathers

.
 
The senior McCain served in the Navy in the Pacific theater during World War II, most notably as commander of the Second Fast Carrier Force and Task Force 38. He was present at the formal signing of the Japanese surrender on the

USS Missouri

on Sept. 2, 1945.
 
In his memoir, Sen. McCain recounted that his grandfather was eager to get home after the war ended and didn't want to stay for the ceremony:
 
"" 'I don't give a damn about seeing the surrender,' my grandfather told (Admiral William) Halsey. 'I want to get the hell out of here.' To which Halsey replied, 'Maybe you do, but you're not going. You were commanding this task force when the war ended, and I'm making sure history gets it straight.' In his memoir, Halsey described my grandfather 'cursing and sputtering' as he returned to his flagship.""
 
The senior McCain returned home soon afterward to his wife in California. The day after his return, his wife hosted a small homecoming party for him.
 
""In the middle of the celebration my grandfather turned to my grandmother, announced that he felt ill, and then collapsed,"" McCain wrote. ""He was sixty one years old. He had fought his war and died. His Navy physician attributed his fatal heart attack to 'complete fatigue resulting from the strain of the last months of combat.' ""
 
His obituary ran on the front page of the

New York Times

, and includes the detail that he had returned home only the day before.
 
""Admiral McCain's groups were called the world's most powerful task force and the destruction they wrought on Japanese military installations and armament centers played a vital role in reducing the country's ability to fight and bringing about final victory,"" according to the obituary.
 
We find McCain's statement that his grandfather died the day after returning from World War II to be True.

Samuel ""Joe the Plumber"" Wurzelbacher says Marcy Kaptur opposed a ban on gender abortions
","
Almost 40 years after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade legalized abortion under most circumstances, abortion remains a political hot button. 
Samuel ""Joe the Plumber"" Wurzelbacher, the Republican congressional candidate in Ohio's 9th District, demonstrates that in a news release, video and series of Twitter tweets aimed at Democratic incumbent Marcy Kaptur.

""I'm not saying that Marcy Kaptur has the same belief system as someone in the Chinese politburo or that she thinks it's OK to kill unborn babies. And I'm not saying that Marcy Kaptur believes in gendercide,"" he says in the campaign video.

""But Marcy Kaptur voted against a ban which would have prevented the aborting of a baby girl for the sole reason that she's a girl.""

That's an emotional pitch.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look.

Wurzlbacher’s campaign said the vote was on H.R. 3541, the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act of 2012, or ""PRENDA.""

The bill, sponsored by Rep. Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican, would have made it a federal crime with a five-year prison sentence to perform or force a woman to undergo a gender-selection abortion -- a practice that is most common in some Asian countries where families that want sons abort female fetuses.

Under the bill, doctors, nurses and medical personnel who do not report suspected gender-related abortions would also face prison and a fine. The male partner and parents of the woman having the abortion would be able to sue for damages. The woman would be exempt from prosecution or civil suit.

Republicans said in debate that gender-selection abortion amounts to ""gendercide"" and a ""war on women"" because it is female fetuses that are most often targeted -- rhetoric that effectively turned the tables on Democrats who previously knocked Republicans for their stances on the Violence Against Women Act and who are pushing legislation requiring equal pay for men and women.

The bill's backers supported their charge of ""gendercide,"" the Christian Science Monitor reported, by citing a study showing that an analysis of the third child born to Chinese, Indian, and Korean parents in the U.S. ""strongly suggest[s]"" prenatal sex selection.

But a review of the legislation by the Guttmacher Institute, which promotes reproductive health and rights, argues that such practices are not widespread in the United States and that the studies to support the bill cannot prove that gender-selection abortions are a significant problem, even in particular immigrant communities.

""What is conclusively known,"" wrote Guttmacher's Sneha Barot, ""is that the U.S. sex ratio at birth in 2005 stood at 105 boys to 100 girls, squarely within biologically normal parameters.""

In a vote on May 31, the House bill won a majority of representatives -- 246 votes in favor and 168 against -- but failed because it was considered under a suspension of House rules. That procedure, normally used for non-controversial measures, limits debate and requires a two-thirds majority vote to pass.

Franks said in a news interview before the vote that he expected the measure to fail, but that it was a strategic goal to force Democrats to vote against it.

""I think we’re doing the right thing strategically,"" he told The Washington Post, adding that he wouldn’t be surprised if GOP candidates and conservative groups used the vote to attack Democratic opponents.

Franks was correct on that point. In one subsequent statement, Wurzelbacher described Kaptur as ""supporting abortions based on gender and skin color.""

We contacted Kaptur's campaign. Spokesman Steve Fought said the congresswoman opposed the bill because of privacy issues it raised and its potential consequences.

""How do you prove someone had a gender-based abortion?"" he asked, asserting that the proof would involve medical personnel knowing a woman's reason for an abortion and whether and when she knew the sex of a fetus.

Knowing  the gender of  a fetus would involve sonograms, he said. Medical personnel fearing the possibility of prosecution could reduce the use of sonograms, against the health interest of fetuses, children and mothers -- particularly in the Asian and immigrant communities  the bill targets.

""It was an eminently bad piece of legislation that was introduced strictly for political posturing, under suspension of the rules and not through committee,"" Fought said. ""The video proves that point. It was a show bill. They wanted to get people on the record voting against it so they can demagogue it.""

Where does that leave us?

Wurzelbacher’s statement is accurate. Kaptur did vote against PRENDA. The bill would ban gender-selection abortions.

But additional information is needed for clarification. Kaptur's record on abortion has been consistent. In a story about this vote, Roll Call, a Washington publication, described her as a  Democrat who opposes abortion. 
But in this case, her staff said, concerns about other effects and consequences of the legislation played a role in her vote. And, the bill’s leading sponsor acknowledged that political strategy drove the process under which it was considered.

Do only 18 percent of Portland elementary schools offer art compared to 83 percent nationally?
","Portland Mayor Sam Adams loves Twitter. And we love that he loves Twitter, not least of all because it leads to an interesting PolitiFact Oregon item now and again.

Last week, Adams took to the social networking service to bemoan the decline of arts education in city schools.

""Clarification: Only 18% of Portland ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS have art instruction compared to 83% nationally.""

(He initially tweeted the same statistic but failed to note that it applied only to elementary schools.)

He offered a link to the website of the Creative Advocacy Network, a group that is pushing for a strong arts curriculum. (His spokeswoman Caryn Brooks confirmed this was the source of the Tweet as well.)

We spoke with Executive Director Jessica Jarratt Miller, who said the national number came from a study done by the U.S. Department of Education. That study looked at the percent of public elementary schools that have instruction designed for various arts subjects. According to that study -- which found its numbers through a representative survey process -- about 94 percent of elementary schools have music education and 83 percent have visual arts education.

The Portland-specific numbers came from CAN’s own research. Jarratt Miller said those numbers reflect the percentage of Portland-area schools that reported employing an art teacher in a specific field even if it was only part time. According to their figures, 58 percent of Portland-area schools employ a music teacher and 18 percent employ a visual arts teacher.

Now, we had no reason to doubt CAN’s figures. We’d PolitiFacted the group before when it said 77 percent of elementary school students in Portland graduate without taking an arts class and found its numbers reliable. What we couldn’t be sure about was whether the group was actually examining the same thing the federal department was examining. Could the two statistics be compared?

That’s always difficult, Jarratt Miller said. ""In any case, I believe that at the 30,000 foot level (how many schools provide some level of instruction in art or music), we have successfully pulled comparable data from Portland and from this national study,"" she wrote in an e-mail.

Our concern was that the national study simply asked whether schools were ""offering instruction designated specifically for various arts subjects"" whereas the Portland figures were looking at the number of schools employing a teacher specifically for an arts field. The difference is important because a school could offer art instruction in a classroom -- as many Portland schools do -- without explicitly employing an art teacher.

Lucky for us, the national study looked at who was teaching those subjects. It found that specialists were teaching the music classes 91 percent of the time and the arts classes 84 percent of the time. Other schools had classroom teachers doing art instruction or brought in outside volunteers and artists-in-residence.

This doesn’t necessarily clarify how closely CAN and the fed’s numbers can be compared. But it does seem to demonstrate that a gulf exists.

If you do the math, you find that about 70 percent of U.S. elementary schools offer visual arts classes that are taught by a specialist (someone with a teaching certificate in an arts discipline), whereas only 18 percent of Portland schools have a dedicated teacher for visual arts. And, in truth, that 18 percent might have to be shifted lower to match the federal statistic perfectly because CAN didn’t ask schools to note whether their art teachers were certified in any way, though Jarratt Miller suspects most are.

Even an 18 to 70 percent split seemed too big to be true to us. We asked Jarratt Miller what some of the causes could be. Part of it, she said, was the simple fact that Oregon has no statewide art education requirements, unlike most other states. (That seemed strange to us -- but the Oregon Department of Education confirmed it.)

That brings us to our ruling. The figures Adams used in his tweet both come from reliable sources. We’re not sure they can be perfectly compared, but even if you do your best to chip away at the national number, you’re still left with a dramatic gulf in which 70 percent of elementary schools nationally say they offer art education with a certified art teacher while only 18 percent of Portland-area schools can likely say the same.

The general point here, that Portland is falling behind the national average for art education is as accurate as it is startling. We rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2012/jun/11/sam-adams/do-only-18-percent-portland-elementary-schools-off/

Obama ad says Romney outsourced Massachusetts jobs
","
Mitt Romney says he speaks the language of business. But a new Obama campaign ad says Romney's economic record in Massachusetts shows he was unsuccessful and out of touch. 
The ad, dubbed ""We’ve Heard it all Before,"" rattles off negative outcomes from Romney’s gubernatorial term: losses in manufacturing, near-the-bottom job creation, billions in public debt. 
This one caught our attention: ""Instead of hiring workers from his own state, Romney outsourced call center jobs to India.""

Sending American jobs overseas is a touchy topic these days. We did some digging and found that the image in the ad -- a darkened Massachusetts workplace juxtaposed with an Indian man wearing a phone headset -- doesn’t tell the complete story.

Origin of the charge

The Obama campaign pointed us to news accounts of a budget issue in 2004, the second year of Romney’s term. The Democratic-controlled Massachusetts legislature sent Romney a budget with an amendment that ""would prohibit Massachusetts from contracting with companies that ‘outsource’ the state's work to other countries,"" according to the Boston Globe.

At the time, many states were contracting with companies that outsourced some form of their work overseas. The Government Accountability Office found that in 2005, 43 states had contracts with companies administering state programs in which some of the work, primarily customer service and software development, was done overseas. Expenditures for services performed offshore were relatively small, the GAO found, and services performed offshore constituted a tiny fraction of the total services provided through the contracts.

But it was enough of a hot button that 38 states were considering similar bans on contracting with companies that outsourced, the Globe wrote. Romney, then, was forced to weigh two competing interests: protecting jobs in his state vs. saving taxpayers money. The Globe pointed out that lawmakers in Kansas considered a similar measure but pulled the plug when they learned it would cost the state an additional $640,000. Massachusetts’ proposal was favored by labor unions but opposed by some economists who said it didn’t make economic sense for taxpayers to pay more for low-skill jobs.

Ultimately, Romney vetoed the measure because he said that even if those jobs were back in the United States, they would not necessarily have been in Massachusetts.

He said,""There's no question we are affected by outsourcing, as is every other state. Any job that leaves is a big loss, and you want to fight to keep every job in the Commonwealth. The legislation I vetoed was not designed to do anything for Massachusetts employers. It might help ‘call center’ states, but it didn't necessarily protect a single job here. But it had the potential of costing our citizens a lot more money. Ultimately, how you compete with low-cost countries is having a more educated, innovative, hard-working, and capable workforce. And that means that you invest in two things: education and innovation.""

At the time Massachusetts had a $160,000 a month contract with Citigroup to process debit cards for food stamps. Citigroup outsourced its customer service call center to a facility in India.

A small but important detail: the state didn’t outsource the work -- a state contractor did.

The GAO report looking at all states’ outsourcing found that 43 states had some form of outsourcing at work, so Massachusetts was not unique. The Bay State also had offshore contracts through its child support enforcement and unemployment insurance programs in 2005, the GAO said.

The controversy popped up again in 2006 when then-Sen. Edward Kennedy criticized Romney for ""jumping on the offshoring bandwagon,'' according to a Boston Herald story. A Romney official told the newspaper that by then, only a handful of overseas workers were still working on a Medicaid subcontract. The food stamp contract previously held by Citigroup (later JP Morgan Chase) had expired and the new contract was awarded to a company whose call center was in Utah.

Our ruling

Obama’s ad charges that ""Romney outsourced call center jobs to India.""

The Obama campaign's wording suggests a broader, more deliberate policy when the state was sending some work overseas. But in choosing to veto the bill, Romney let the arrangement continue. The statement leaves out important information. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2012/jun/11/barack-obama/obama-ad-says-romney-outsourced-massachusetts-jobs/

Mitt Romney says he reduced Massachusetts unemployment to 4.7 percent
","
In a new campaign ad, Mitt Romney doesn't mince words in boasting about the Massachusetts economy when he was governor. 
The ad -- which combines stirring music, footage of welders and forklift drivers and images of Romney gladhandling with factory employees -- was released June 8, 2012. ""Romney,"" the ad says, ""reduced unemployment to just 4.7 percent."" 
We checked Bureau of Labor Statistics data and found that the statistic was correct. The low point for the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate during Romney’s tenure was 4.7 percent. (It happened during Romney’s final full month in office, December 2006.) 
But the number mirrored the larger national trend. And it's important to note, as we often do, that governors have limited impact on a state's economy. 
Both Massachusetts and the U.S. saw unemployment rates drop during Romney’s governorship. Unemployment declined during that period because the economy was recovering from a recession. 
If you take the numbers from January 2003 to January 2007 -- Romney’s first and last months in office -- you find a drop of 1.2 percentage points nationally (from 5.8 percent to 4.6 percent) and 1.0 points in Massachusetts (from 5.6 percent to 4.6 percent). That's not much of a difference. 
As for Romney's impact, economists have consistently told us that policies of a governor have a relatively small effect on a state's economy. 
Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent group that analyzes fiscal trends in the state, warned us in June 2011 not to put to much stock in any governor's influence over their state's rate of job growth. The ability for governors to manage the state economy is vastly overrated, Widmer said. States are tied to larger economic forces, he added, and governors often claim too much credit when things are going well and no blame when things are going poorly. 
Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, said the policies of governors, presidents and mayors can affect job creation, but they play a small role in the overall picture. 
""Almost always,"" he said, ""the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job. A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began. The executive’s policies may have speeded or slowed the recovery around the margins, but the conditions that caused the recovery to begin were already present before the oath of office was administered."" 
(As we’ve noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) 
In fact, the way the Romney campaign phrased the claim we’re checking is particularly bold. It doesn’t say that ""under Romney, unemployment declined,"" or ""due to Romney’s policies, unemployment declined,"" or ""in Massachusetts, we reduced unemployment."" The ad we're checking says simply that ""Romney reduced unemployment,"" as if no other factors mattered. 
Our ruling 
The number is correct, but the ad oversteps in suggesting that Romney did this on his own. The employment situation in Massachusetts was subject to many factors, not just the governor’s policy. On balance, we rate the claim Half True. 
EDITOR'S NOTE: We have changed the headline for this story to remove any confusion about which statement we were rating.

Bob McDonnell says Virginia is No. 1 state in veterans per capita
","
Gov. Bob McDonnell -- who spent 21 years in the U.S. Army and Reserves and is the son of career Army officer -- is proud to talk about the large military bases in Virginia and the current and past service of many who live here.

On Memorial Day, he addressed 2,000 at the Virginia War Memorial in Richmond. His speech, on the cost of freedom, included the claim that Virginia ""is home to more veterans per capita than any state in America.""

The governor has made that statement several times and we wondered if he were correct. So we checked the state veteran counts listed on website of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which are from 2010, and compared them to state population tallies in the 2010 Census.

The VA calculated there were 22.7 million veterans in the U.S. They made up 7.3 percent of the nation’s 308.7 million people.

Virginia had about 822,300 veterans in 2010 and a census of 8,001,024 people. Veterans made up 10.28 percent of Old Dominion’s population.

But three states topped Virginia’s veteran population per capita:

*Alaska had a 10.84 percent veteran population. It had an estimated 77,000 veterans and a population of 721,523.
*Maine had a 10.43 percent veteran population. It had an estimated 138,600 veterans and a population of 1,333,074.
*Montana had a 10.31 percent veteran population. It had an estimated 102,000 veterans and a population of 989,415.

We asked McDonnell’s office for the governor’s numbers and got a tally that was similar to ours. It was based on a 2011 VA estimate of veterans and the Census’ 2011 population estimate.

Under that data, Virginia ranked third, with 10.17 percent of the population formerly in military uniform. The leader was once again Alaska, with a 10.7 percent population of veterans, followed by Maine, at 10.27 percent. Montana slipped to No. 4, at 10.11 percent.

Gubernatorial spokesman Jeff Caldwell said McDonnell meant to say Virginia is ""one of"" the states with the highest per capita veteran populations and made a mistake while speaking extemporaneously.

The governor made the same mistake on May 29, the day after Memorial Day, during his monthly broadcast on WTOP radio in Washington. With little effort, we found two other occasions where he made the erroneous claim.

In case you’re wondering, Virginia has the seventh largest veteran population in the nation, according to the VA. Here’s a list of the top seven and their estimated 2011 veteran populations: California, 1,918,073; Texas, 1,683,237; Florida, 1,617,248; Pennsylvania, 933,404; New York, 913,489; Ohio, 867,240; Virginia, 823,348.

Our ruling

McDonnell’s office acknowledges the governor erred on Memorial Day when he said Virginia has the most veterans per capita of any state. Virginia was No. 4 in 2010 and moved up to No. 3 in 2011.

Political group says Jeff Wentworth, bending the rules, spent nearly $212,000 in campaign funds leasing luxury cars
","
San Antonio state Sen. Jeff Wentworth, headed to a July 2012 runoff with Republican challenger Donna Campbell, drew fire from a political group before leading the May primary, including a claim about the cars he drives.

On its anti-Wentworth website, www.wentworthrecord.com, the Conservative Republicans of Texas PAC says: ""Wentworth has used $211,743.96 in campaign contributions to lease luxury cars including the Lexus he currently drives."" The claim appears under the heading ""Bending the Rules.""

Curiosity steered us to take a closer look.

A word: It’s legal for state legislators to lease vehicles with campaign funds so long as the vehicles are not for personal benefit. Put another way, Texas law permits campaign contributions to be used to pay expenses incurred while holding an elected office as well as those incurred while campaigning.

Conversely, state law bars candidates or officeholders from converting campaign funds to ""personal use,"" which the law defines as a ""use that primarily furthers individual or family purposes not connected with the performance of duties or activities as a candidate.""

Austin lawyer Fred Lewis, who wrote a 2004 report detailing expenditures by Texas lawmakers on vehicles and other expenses, told us by phone that the leasing of cars is a ""very common practice. There is nothing unusual about it in the least.""

And the fact that Wentworth leases cars qualifies as old news.

According to a July 30, 2007, Houston Chronicle news article, Wentworth spent $20,308 from January through June 2007 to lease a Lexus. The newspaper quoted Wentworth as saying the campaign Lexus is in keeping with the kind of cars he drives in his personal life. He said it is necessary for driving the dangerous stretch of Interstate 35 between San Antonio and Austin. ""It's a matter of safety,"" Wentworth told the newspaper.

Three years earlier, Chronicle columnist Rick Casey noted that Houston Democratic Sen. Rodney Ellis was paying $630 a month to lease a campaign vehicle and Sen. John Whitmire, D-Houston, had plunked down $29,211 in campaign contributions for a ""campaign vehicle."" Casey said Wentworth and then-Sen. Kip Averitt, R-Waco, had leased top-of-the-line Infiniti sedans.

We asked the PAC for the basis of its claim, especially the part about bending the rules.

Spokesman Allen Blakemore emailed us a spreadsheet listing car lease expenditures from 2000 to 2012 that he told us by phone were drawn from Wentworth’s campaign finance reports. We compared the research to Wentworth’s campaign finance filings, finding minor discrepancies with the research while otherwise confirming the PAC’s proclaimed cost of the leases, $212,446.20, over the dozen years.

We asked to interview Wentworth and heard from his campaign consultant, Bryan Eppstein, who declined to address the specific claim. Broadly, Eppstein said, Wentworth’s auto expenses are not unusual for a legislator whose district runs from part of Bexar County through four counties into a chunk of Travis County. Wentworth ""travels across his district every day,"" and during this campaign he’s driven to 40 debates in six counties, Eppstein said.

In a follow-up interview, Blakemore asserted that Wentworth drives no other vehicles, so he must have used leased cars for personal purposes. Also, Blakemore said, Wentworth’s reported campaign contributions and expenditures fail to show the senator regularly reimbursing his campaign for times he used the leased vehicles for personal purposes.

Eppstein later said that Wentworth has three personal cars, also saying by phone that Wentworth has driven leased vehicles only for campaign or officeholder purposes.

Earlier, Eppstein provided a confidential June 9, 2009, order from the Texas Ethics Commission dismissing a complaint referring in part to Wentworth spending $54,740 in campaign funds on auto leases.

The order quotes Wentworth swearing that he used those vehicles for office-related purposes. ""I have other vehicles for personal use, and personally pay the cost of operating the leased vehicles when they are used for personal purposes."" Eppstein told us Wentworth’s statement that he paid for personal uses of leased vehicles was hypothetical.

The commission’s order notes that Wentworth swore that he used the leased vehicles only for official duties and used personal vehicles for personal purposes. ""There is no evidence to contradict"" those sworn statements, the order says, thus insufficient evidence that Wentworth violated the law.

Our ruling

Wentworth spent some $212,000 in campaign funds leasing vehicles, as the PAC says. Then again, such leases are allowed if the vehicles are used for officeholder or campaign purposes, which is how Wentworth's camp says he uses the leased vehicles. 
All told, this claim portrays spending on a permitted activity as ""bending the rules"" without evidence of wrongdoing. We rate the statement as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/jun/11/connservative-republicans-texas-pac/political-group-says-jeff-wentworth-bending-rules-/

Rep. Jeff Fitzgerald says Minnesota and Indiana have passed ‘right to work’ laws
","
The prospect of a ban on workers having to join unions or pay dues has injected the debate over so-called ""right to work"" legislation into political campaigns across Wisconsin and the United States.

It drew attention in Wisconsin after Gov. Scott Walker’s successful drive to sharply curtail collective bargaining for public employees raised the question of whether state Republicans might extend that to private-sector unions.

Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald, R-Horicon, is a ""right-to-work"" supporter and helped Walker pass the public-union measure. If he wins a U.S. Senate seat in November 2012, he might have a chance to vote on national legislation banning compulsory dues payment.

In May, the Wisconsin Democratic Party and Salon.com posted a video clip of Fitzgerald telling a Journal Sentinel reporter that Walker’s Act 10 union legislation was not surprising, given the GOP desire to balance the budget without tax increases.

He added some Republicans wanted to go further than Walker.

""I had people in my caucus who were wondering if we were going to do ‘right to work’ in this state,"" he said during the interview. ""To tell you the truth the collective bargaining (measure), to me, I thought was more of a middle ground, if you can believe that.""

He added: ""I had a number of people who thought (we should do) much like the states around us now -- Minnesota has passed and Indiana has passed ‘right to work’ states (laws).""

Critics say such laws are anti-worker, while supporters said they attract businesses. ""Right-to-work"" laws are most common in southern and western states.

But has ""right-to-work"" become a trend in nearby states? Let’s look at Fitzgerald’s statement on Minnesota and Indiana.

The second one is easy: News reports trumpeted Indiana’s move to become the 23rd ""right to work"" state in January 2012.

That move drew attention in Wisconsin because it was signed by Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a national Republican figure whom Walker has cited as a role model.

But did heavily unionized Minnesota follow suit and become just the second state since Oklahoma in 2001 to enact the law?

""Right to work"" legislation was debated in Minnesota in early 2012, at a time when Republicans there controlled both legislative houses.

Instead of sending legislation to Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democratic Farmer Labor party member and right-to-work opponent, a group of conservative Republicans pushed a constitutional amendment to let voters decide.

On March 12, 2012, just before Fitzgerald made his statement, a ""right to work"" bill promoting a constitutional amendment won approval in a Minnesota Senate committee, by a 7-6 vote amid labor protests.

But that is far from final passage.

Indeed, in a very short time, the Minnesota bill was on life support, and by May 2012 it was considered all but dead, according to various news accounts.

The measure never emerged from a second committee, much less moved on to a full floor vote. A failed attempt in early May to attach right to work to the Vikings stadium legislation briefly brought the issue back into the public eye.

The legislative session is over and the bill is history now, said state Sen. Dave Thompson, chief author of the bill. Thompson said he could introduce it in 2013 if Republicans keep control of the Minnesota Legislature in the fall 2012 elections.

Bottom line: It’s clear from the history that Fitzgerald’s comment incorrectly lumped Minnesota in with Indiana.

There is one notable nuance in the timing the comment.

The Journal Sentinel interview was conducted March 21, 2012 but didn’t go public until May. It was for a Journal Sentinel documentary on the 2012 recall election, ""The Choice"", but the comment didn’t make it into the final version. Apparently, a Democratic Party tracker also filmed the interview as it was conducted after an appearance at the Milwaukee Press Club.

So at the time, the Minnesota committee vote was fresh, and it was on Fitzgerald’s mind when he spoke, said Steve Stanek.

But even that was not a final vote.

And media reports on March 19, 2012 -- two days before Fitzgerald’s comments -- had GOP Senate Majority Leader Dave Senjem saying the votes aren’t there for the ""right-to-work"" amendment.

Fitzgerald told a reporter that Minnesota and Indiana have ""passed"" ""right-to-work"" laws. He was on target regarding Indiana, but spoke prematurely about Wisconsin’s westerly neighbor.

"['New Jersey', 'Crime', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie said while he was U.S. Attorney, 10 percent of the state Legislature was jailed
","
Gov. Chris Christie identified three ingredients for brewing corruption in state government: districts drawn to favor incumbents, no term limits and entitlement that grows with time.

Those are some of the reasons why the Republican governor favors capping the time members of the New Jersey Assembly and Senate can serve, he said Wednesday at a town hall meeting in Piscataway.

Without such restraints, corruption may run as rampant in Trenton as Christie claims it was while he was the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey.

""I think that we should do it for a few reasons, corruption is certainly one of them. As you know when I was U.S. Attorney we wound up putting 10 percent of the state Legislature in jail during my seven years,"" Christie said, eliciting a round of applause from the audience.

Later, he said, ""I think the longer people are there the more entitled they become. The more entitled they feel.""

New Jersey can’t shake its connection with corrupt officials, a link that has been well established over time. But did Christie really put away 10 percent of the state Legislature?

By Christie’s count, his office won more than 130 convictions or guilty pleas from both Republicans and Democrats. Many of those came from local officials.

Christie nabbed a handful of state senators and assemblymen while he was U.S. Attorney, from 2002 to the end of 2008. But 10 percent of the state Legislature is an overreach.

In total, 120 legislators comprise the state Legislature, with 40 in the Senate and 80 in the Assembly. During Christie’s nearly seven years as U.S. Attorney, PolitiFact New Jersey found more than 185 people who served in either chamber.

Christie’s office charged five legislators -- all Democrats -- while they were in office: state Sens. Wayne Bryant, Joseph Coniglio and Sharpe James and Assemblymen Mims Hackett and Alfred Steele. All five served jail time.  

That’s less than 3 percent of all the people who served.

The federal investigation of two other state legislators who were jailed, Republican Assemblyman Daniel Van Pelt and Democratic Assemblyman Joseph Vas, began while Christie was U.S. Attorney. However, they were not charged until after Christie left the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

Democrat John Lynch, a former state Senate president, was charged and jailed while Christie was U.S. Attorney. But Lynch was no longer in office when he was charged.

Even if those individuals are included, the fact remains that Christie didn’t jail 10 percent of the state Legislature during his time as U.S. Attorney.

""Really?"" Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said in an e-mail.  ""Every other person in the audience understood the Governor was making a rhetorical point about his extensive record in combating political corruption as U.S. Attorney and not, as you seem to be suggesting, citing, with great exactitude, some baseball statistic.""

""The Governor was emphasizing, conversationally, the gravity of the corruption which in those years reached into the highest levels of the legislature as well as high-ranking party bosses and operatives, and former legislators across this state – an extensive and politically powerful rogues gallery.  Honestly, if you were actually in attendance at the town hall, heard his tone and inflection when he made this remark -- and were around in those years in New Jersey -- you would know that,"" Drewniak said.

Still, the governor can make a point about his record on corruption without saying he put 10 percent of the state Legislature in jail. That’s just not true.

Our ruling

Christie said when he was U.S. Attorney ""we wound up putting 10 percent of the state Legislature in jail during my seven years.""

As the state’s chief federal law enforcement officer, the governor charged scores of public officials with corruption.

Five of those officials were sitting state legislators at the time they were charged. All five were later jailed. That’s not a trivial figure, but it’s not 10 percent of the state Legislature.

We rate this claim False.

"['Georgia', 'Jobs', 'Paul Broun']","
Broun manufacturing claim based on weak proof
","
Primary Election Day is less than two months away, which means U.S. Rep. Paul Broun of Athens is busy burnishing his accomplishments.

Broun marked the recent launch of his re-election campaign by saying his proudest achievement is helping to lure the manufacturer Caterpillar to the Athens area, where it will open a plant to make construction equipment, he said in a television interview.

Caterpillar’s factory is ""going to create about 3,000 jobs here in central Georgia and northeast Georgia. It’s going to be about a $3 billion infusion of cash into our economy,"" Broun said May 23 on WMGT-TV in Macon.

Those numbers make it sound like Broun is doing a heck of a lot for his constituents. But is he padding his resume?

Landing the 1 million-square-foot Caterpillar plant was a coup for Georgia. Gov. Nathan Deal announced the victory himself, and both his office and Caterpillar headquarters issued news releases that described the plant’s economic impact.

Caterpillar will invest about $200 million to open the plant, and it expects to employ 1,400 people when it opens for business in late 2013, the Governor’s Office announced. In return, the state and its taxpayers are giving the company a $75 million package of incentives.

PolitiFact Georgia called and emailed Broun’s office for more than a week but received no replies. So we took to our own research and found that Broun’s figures are problematic.

First of all, Broun’s figures don’t match the estimates by Caterpillar.

Caterpillar’s news release about the new facility cited economic impact figures from Sharon Younger, who runs a market research firm with headquarters in Jackson, Tenn., that also specializes in public relations.

Younger’s research was funded by Caterpillar, although she did not know what firm she was working for when she did her calculations, she told PolitiFact Georgia.

Younger told PolitiFact Georgia that she estimated the impact for 12 counties that surround the plant’s site: Banks, Barrow, Clark, DeKalb, Gwinnett, Jackson, Madison, Morgan, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Rockdale and Walton.

The Caterpillar plant will create more than 3,600 jobs for this area, and its economic impact will total about $2 billion in a single year when it starts running, Younger said. (In Caterpillar’s news release, she placed the impact at about $2.4 billion.)

When compared with Caterpillar’s official estimate, Broun’s job number is about 17 percent too low, while his economic impact number is about a half-billion dollars too high.

Also, Broun’s geography is wrong. Caterpillar’s impact figures are for counties in northeast Georgia only. None of the counties Younger considered are in Middle Georgia.

Younger released only the bare outlines of her methodology, saying most of the information is proprietary. This means that no one can verify her numbers.  

Younger defended her estimates by saying that she used a standard method to make them. But that doesn’t mean her estimates are correct.  

PolitiFact Georgia frequently writes about economic impact studies, and we’ve found that the information she did not release can make the difference between a credible study and one that’s bunk.

This is why:

Researchers must predict how much a new factory will change economic activity in the local area in order to make an accurate economic impact estimate, according to the manual that outlines the method that Younger used and Bruce Seaman, an economist with Georgia State University.  

This prediction is crucial, Seaman said. If the Caterpillar plant gets all its parts and materials for its excavators from the Athens area, it’ll have a much bigger impact on the local economy than it would if it uses steel from China and electronics from Germany.  

Figuring out how much of this activity takes place locally can take a great deal of research. Younger said she did this work but did not detail how.

Another impact estimate released by a University of Georgia expert is more conservative. Jeffrey Humphreys, the director of UGA’s Selig Center for Economic Growth, said the economic impact would be $1.4 billion, according to an article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

For each job at the plant, 2.4 will be created across the state. Caterpillar’s estimate was for a smaller 12-county region.

Humphreys was on leave and could not be contacted by deadline.

How do we rule?

Broun’s jobs figure is lower than those released by Caterpillar, while the amount of economic impact he described is at least a half-billion dollars higher than the one the company gave.

Broun also gave an incorrect description for the region covered by Caterpillar’s economic estimate. It’s for northeast Georgia, not northeast and Middle Georgia.  

Caterpillar’s estimates were not peer-reviewed or conducted by an independent professional. Most importantly, the methodology behind them is not transparent.

Broun’s overarching point is this: The new Caterpillar plant will bring a lot of jobs and inject a lot of money into Georgia’s economy. But he strays on some of the finer points, and PolitiFact could not verify the methodology used to come up with some of the numbers.

His estimates need a lot of context and clarification, even though his larger point has merit.

We therefore rule Broun’s statement Half-True.",/factchecks/2012/jun/11/paul-broun/broun-manufacturing-claim-based-weak-proof/

When the government’s jobs report for May offered a bleak picture of the economy, with employers adding just 69,000 jobs in May, U.S. Rep. Diane Black, R-Gallatin, and other lawmakers expressed their frustrations, often in very partisan terms.

The report said the unemployment rate edged up slightly to 8.2 percent, from 8.1 percent in April, and Black issued a press release that among other things said the prospects for unemployed or underemployed Americans finding full-time work are not very good ""after 40 straight months of unemployment at 8 percent or higher.""

We know the unemployment has remained stubbornly high, but has it really been at 8 percent or higher for 40 straight months?

For the purposes of this ruling, we're only going to look closely at the statistics Black cited and stay out of the political blame game. Suffice to say, it’s not hard to find Republicans blaming Democratic policies and Democrats blaming Republican obstruction for the inability to move the economy closer to full employment.

We called Black’s office and asked them to back up the claim. Her spokeswoman, Allison Huff, pointed us to a chart compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is the gold standard for unemployment statistics.

According to the bureau, the last time unemployment was below 8 percent was in January 2009, when it was 7.8 percent -- it then spiked quickly to 8.3 percent in February of 2009 and to 9.4 percent by May before topping out at 10.0 percent in October of 2009. It dropped gradually from there, and the May report listing unemployment at 8.2 percent marked the 40th consecutive month it has been at 8 percent or higher.

As dismal as that may be, it’s not the record.

""The rate of unemployment in the United States has exceeded 8 percent since February 2009, making the past three years the longest stretch of high unemployment in this country since the Great Depression,"" the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported in a study in February 2012.

In the Great Depression era, unemployment topped 15 percent annually for six straight years, from 1931 to 1936, and never fell below 8.7 percent over 12 years, according to estimates adopted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In four consecutive years, unemployment exceeded 20 percent a year.

Our colleagues at PolitiFact National cited those figures when they rated as False a claim by Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who said, ""We have unemployment that rivals the Great Depression.""

There is a qualifier, though. The Depression-era unemployment data counted those age 14 and up, not 16 and up (the standard that began in 1948). In addition, monthly unemployment statistics were not kept until 1948 as well. Thus, all statistics during the Great Depression were on an annual basis.

Our ruling

Rep. Black did not go as far as some other Republicans and claim that unemployment is as bad as during the Great Depression. She merely said it has been at 8 percent or higher for 40 straight months. Based upon the government’s own data, we rate her statement as True.",/factchecks/2012/jun/11/diane-black/tennessee-congresswoman-diane-black-says-jobless-r/
"['Ohio', 'Bipartisanship', 'John Kasich']","
Gov. John Kasich says his leadership has led to more bipartisanship in the legislature
","
Editor's note: This item was updated to correct a vote total for the 2011 budget vote in the Ohio House. 
John Kasich doesn’t like playing second fiddle, but when he was on ""Meet the Press"" on June 3, that’s pretty much what he was doing. 
The Republican governor was on the show facing off against Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts to argue as proxies on the relative merits of the candidates for president.

Hoping to give a boost to GOP nominee Mitt Romney, Kasich laid into President Barack Obama’s argument that Republicans in Congress are blocking his moves at every turn and undercutting his agenda.

Citing his own experience in Ohio, Kasich said the key is to take the ""terrible"" politics in Washington D.C. and forge a bipartisan road.

""When I started in Ohio, it was terrible,"" he told host David Gregory. ""We’re now getting bipartisan support for our bills. And that's called leadership.""

Was Kasich right? PolitiFact Ohio looked at a previous claim by Kasich in 2011 that there had been some ""significant"" bipartisan accomplishments during his first year in office and rated that True. But this statement was more sweeping. PolitiFact Ohio decided to pull the voting records and see what they showed.

We started out by determining what bills could be fairly described as Kasich administration initiatives as opposed to something lawmakers may have wanted to do.

After consulting with an informal trio of PolitiFact Ohio Statehouse reporters, we came up with eight key bills in Kasich’s first year that are fairly described as his babies: the state operating budget, the state transportation budget, the JobsOhio economic development board bill, a business regulation reform bill, a sentencing reform bill, a collective bargaining reform bill (known as Senate Bill 5), a bill cracking down on pill mills and a measure allowing oil and gas drilling in state parks.

Before revealing the results, we should note that Kasich’s fellow Republicans hold the advantage over Democrats in both the House (59-40) and the Senate (23-10).

So for those eight bills from 2011, we found that on the average, they received 17 House Democratic votes out of a possible 40 and four Senate Democratic votes of a possible 10. On half of the votes in the House, the Kasich bills received three or fewer votes -- which is less than 10 percent of the Democratic votes that could have been obtained. And half of the time in the Senate, the Kasich bills received no Senate votes.

Among the bills receiving scant support from either Democratic caucus were the controversial collective bargaining reform legislation, which no Democrats voted for, and Kasich’s state budget, which received only three House Democratic votes.

Next, we looked at bills that Kasich has pushed in his second year as governor. After again consulting our informal panel, we came up with seven key bills Kasich has been the driving force behind in 2012. They are the collateral sanctions bill, a Lake Erie water usage bill, a second JobsOhio economic development package as well as four bills that were part of what Kasich called his mid-budget review, or MBR. The MBR bills were wide-ranging rewrites of Ohio law or leftover initiatives which the Kasich administration wasn’t ready to roll out in his main state budget in 2011 covering education, energy, tax policy and a catch-all bill covering various areas of administration policy.

For those seven bills, we found on the average that Kasich received 26 House Democratic votes out of a possible 40 and five Senate Democratic votes out of a possible 10. (Please note that those averages are based on six votes per chamber as each chamber hasn’t voted on one of the seven bills listed.) With the exception of the Lake Erie water use bill, which received a single Democratic vote in the House, we found that Kasich received at least 16 House Democratic votes for all of his other initiatives.

In the Senate, Kasich’s bills in 2012 didn’t get much more support than his bills in 2011, although he was blanked only once instead of four times.

Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols said the clearest example of Kasich’s point is to compare the state budget vote in 2011 (no  Democratic votes in either the House or the  Senate) to the mid-budget review package of 2012 (an average of 23 House Democratic votes and five Senate Democratic votes). ""Things are much better than they were back then,"" he said in terms of getting bipartisan support.

So where does this leave us as the dust settled?

When Kasich appeared on ""Meet the Press"" to bash Obama, he wanted to draw a sharp contrast between the gridlock in Washington and what he sees as his record in Ohio. He said that when he started in Ohio, the political atmosphere was ""terrible"" but ""now we’re getting bipartisan support for our bills.""

Our math does show that Kasich is getting more support for his key bills in 2012 than when he began his term -- 26 House Democratic votes compared to 16 and five Senate Democratic votes instead of four. Furthermore, the Democratic shutouts for Kasich have dropped off sharply in his second year.

However, Kasich appears to have overstated the Democratic opposition to his initiatives when he came into office in 2011.

It is true that almost all Democrats opposed his state budget, and no Democrats voted for the controversial rewrite of Ohio’s collective bargaining laws, but at least some Democrats supported most of the other initiatives sought by Kasich in 2011.

We find that to be additional information that puts Kasich’s statement into a clearer context.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Kasich’s statement rates Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/jun/11/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-his-leadership-has-led-more-b/
"['Federal Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Tammy Baldwin']","
Tammy Baldwin says Tommy Thompson’s tax plan would cut taxes by $87,000 for the top 1 percent
","
If you haven’t heard U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, say she is fighting for the middle class in her bid for the U.S. Senate, you haven’t been listening.

But you can be forgiven. The gubernatorial recall all but filled Wisconsin’s political bandwidth until the election was held June 5, 2012.

Now, more attention will turn to Baldwin and the four Republicans seeking to succeed Democrat Herb Kohl in the November 2012 Senate election.
   
Baldwin sounded the middle class theme in attacking the best known GOP candidate, former governor Tommy Thompson, in a memo released to the media May 30, 2012.

She declared:

""Thompson’s tax plan amounts to an average tax cut of almost $87,000 for the top 1 percent.""

The 1 percent are people with incomes over $343,000, according to the memo.

Sounds like a good deal for them. But is Baldwin on target?

Baldwin’s evidence

Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus said Baldwin's is based on a flat tax provision in a tax reform plan that Thompson released in April 2012.

Two paragraphs in the four-page document are devoted to the flat tax.

For two years, individual taxpayers could opt to file a tax return with a 15 percent rate, or file a return using existing exemptions. After two years, Thompson ""would move to an across-the board flat tax with provisions to encourage savings, investment, home ownership and support for charities,"" the plan says.

Here’s the Baldwin math:

In 2009, according to the latest figures available from the Internal Revenue Service, the top 1 percent of federal income tax returns amounts to nearly 1.38 million people. They all earned more than $343,927.

That group generated just over $1.32 trillion in adjusted gross income, which resulted in a total of just over $318 billion in income taxes paid.

Had a 15 percent flat rate been in effect, the ""1 percent"" would have paid $198.7 billion in taxes or $119.3 billion less, under Thompson’s plan.

That means those taxpayers would have paid an average of $86,502 less in income taxes.

Thompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir noted that tax rates ranged from 10 percent to 35 percent in 2009 (as they do now). He said Thompson’s plan ""better balances the nearly half of all Americans that don’t pay income taxes against the nation’s top 1 percent of earners, who pay 37 percent of the income taxes collected.""

As for Baldwin’s figures, he said her analysis ""seems sufficient.""

While Thompson's proposal lacks enough detail for analysis, the Tax Policy Center evaluated the more detailed 15 percent flat tax plan advanced by Newt Gingrich during his 2012 run for the Republican presidential nomination. The center concluded that no one, regardless of income, would see a tax increase under Gingrich's plan. Under one scenario, which divided all taxpayers into five groups based on income, all five groups would get a tax cut under Gingrich's plan.

So, it’s likely Thompson’s plan would benefit many more groups than the 1 percent cited by Baldwin, who is using that approach to bolster her underlying point.

As for the specifics of Baldwin's claim, we ran her numbers by three tax experts: Tax Policy Center senior fellow Roberton Williams and Tax Foundation economist Mark Robyn, both in Washington, D.C.; and Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance president Todd Berry in Madison.

All three said Baldwin is generally on target, but that Thompson’s plan is too short on details to know for sure whether Baldwin’s $87,000 figure is on the money.

Williams said Baldwin’s numbers, on their face, are accurate.

""It’s a back-of-the-envelope calculation, that’s what it is,"" said Robyn.

Robyn and Berry agreed the 1 percent would almost certainly get a tax break under Thompson’s plan, but they couldn’t say whether Baldwin’s figure is accurate because Thompson’s plan doesn’t specify what deductions and exemptions might remain under his flat tax and who would qualify for them.

""Her calculations are probably overstated a little, but we don’t know how much,"" said Berry.

Our rating

Baldwin said Thompson's tax plan ""amounts to an average tax cut of almost $87,000 for the top 1 percent"" and Thompson didn’t refute the figure.

Tax experts said Baldwin’s figure is in the ballpark, at least as an estimate, but that Thompson’s flat tax proposal lacks too much detail to know for sure.

Baldwin’s claim is accurate but needs additional information -- our definition of Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/jun/10/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-says-tommy-thompsons-tax-plan-would-/

Sen. Lamar Alexander says students overcharged on loans to help pay for health care law
","
The health care law that passed in 2010 and which most Republicans say they’d like to scrap has hundreds of provisions, including new sources of revenue to pay for expanded coverage.

Recently, some politicians have made the case that the new law is being paid for in part by using the savings created when Congress took private banks and the subsidies they received out of the business of making guaranteed loans to students.

Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., the Secretary of Education under the first President Bush, took to the Senate floor in May to claim, ""We are overcharging students . . . by $8.7 billion to pay for the health care law.""

We decided to look at whether that’s correct. Alexander’s office declined our request for further clarification of his position.

Our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio tested a similar claim by Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and concluded his statement was Half True. PolitiFact New Hampshire also examined an even more expansive statement from Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, and ruled it Mostly False. The major elements of those items apply here, as well.

As you’ve seen in recent years, the Senate is so divided that not a lot gets done until one side or the other can reach the filibuster threshold of 60 votes to move a bill to a floor vote. The exception to that rule is a bill reconciling a budget bill with an existing budget resolution, which requires only a majority vote of 51 of 100 senators.

That’s how the Reconciliation Act of 2010, changing both student loans and health care, passed the Senate in March of that year with just 56 votes.

Making direct student loans and cutting out the subsidized middle man -- private banks -- was estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to save $58 billion over ten years.

To make a long and convoluted history shorter, $36 billion of that savings was set aside for additional Pell grants, and an additional $3 billion went to other education programs, including historically black colleges and universities. That left roughly $19 billion in savings. Some $10 billion of that was set aside for debt reduction. That leaves roughly $9 billion.

That’s where Alexander’s $8.7 billion figure comes from. Alexander’s floor speech was intended to persuade his colleagues to use some of that $8.7 billion, currently set aside for elements of the public health fund created by the health reform act, to pay for keeping the student loan interest rate, scheduled to rise later this year, at 3.4 percent.

Alexander made the point that the Obama administration had also proposed using the health fund made possible by the student loan savings for other purposes, including deficit reduction.

Also in his speech, he was critical of the move to get rid of the subsidies to the banks through direct student loans. He said those who proposed the direct loans ""did that on the theory that the banks were making too much money."" Again, the savings over 10 years is expected to be $58 billion – money that would have gone not to students, but to the banks’ bottom lines.

As our colleagues in Ohio wrote: The combined student loan-health care bill did not reduce the amount of money that students can borrow. It actually expanded the amount of money available for student aid. What it reduced is the banks’ share.

Alexander also made the case that the government is borrowing money at 2.8 percent and lending it to students at 6.8 percent in order to fund the health care program. That’s the explanation for his saying the government is ""overcharging students."" Alexander did not say whether there was ""overcharging"" when private banks were making student loans with the help of federal government subsidies.  

As for whether the federal government is ""overcharging"" students with the higher interest rate on money it lends, that’s a matter of public policy -- and in 2010, 56 senators agreed with it.

Our colleagues in New Hampshire explained that just pointing out the spread on those two interest rates does not put the entire program’s costs into proper context. Now that they are not receiving subsidies, banks have largely gotten out of the student loan business because it is not profitable for them -- even though they can get the same terms as the federal government.

""Banks can borrow at the same rate as the federal government,"" Jason Delisle, director of the Federal Education Budget Project at the New America Foundation, told them. ""They don’t make money off lending to students at 6.8 percent. … This concept that the difference between the rate the government charges on the loan and the rate they pay to borrow is profit, is totally wrong.""

Justine Sessions, a spokeswoman for the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Pensions and Labor, which is chaired by Democrat Tom Harkin, said that subsidized loans do not make money for the government. They actually cost the federal government money.

""The claim seems to conflate two completely unrelated issues,"" Sessions said. ""The 6.8 percent interest rate was set by Congress in 2002 with overwhelming bipartisan support and it was the projected average rate that would result in 2006 under a fixed rate formula.""

Our ruling

Do the savings from ending the private banking subsidies for student loans help pay for the health care law? Yes, but only 15 percent of those savings is going to health care, and even with that, the bill actually expanded the amount of revenue available for assisting students financially. We rule Alexander’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2012/jun/10/lamar-alexander/sen-lamar-alexander-says-students-overcharged-loan/
"['Rhode Island', 'Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Public Health', 'Elizabeth Roberts']","
Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts says Massachusetts health care cost increases are below the national average following adoption of the state’s health care overhaul
","
As part of the ongoing debate over the cost of medical coverage, Operation Clean Government's State of the State cable television program held a discussion on the pros and cons of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, sometimes called Obamacare.

Critic Lisa Blais of Ocean State Tea Party in Action quoted a May 2012 Associated Press story from Massachusetts talking about ""soaring premiums"" in Massachusetts.

But Rhode Island Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts, who has been working to implement some of the provisions of the Obama plan in Rhode Island, spoke in favor of the act and disagreed.

""Massachusetts is reporting a trend far below the national trend in the escalation of health-care costs in this year,"" she said.

We wondered if the increase in health-care costs in Massachusetts -- where residents are required to have health insurance or pay a penalty -- was really far below the U.S. trend this year.

When we asked Roberts for backup for her claim, her spokeswoman, Maria Tocco, sent us to several different sources.

The first was Page 16 of a May 2012 study by the Massachusetts Division of Health Care Finance and Policy reporting that total medical expenditures among the state's commercial insurers increased by 3 percent from 2009 to 2010.

The second was a table from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services showing that health expenses increased across the U.S. by 3.9 percent from 2009 to 2010.

""Therefore, national expenditures increased from 2009 to 2010 by 30 percent more than in Massachusetts,"" Tocco said.

Not exactly. Those are two different sets of data, essentially comparing apples to oranges.

The first doesn't include Medicare and Medicaid costs. The second does. Medicare and Medicaid covers older and poorer Americans, and people in those groups tend to be sicker, and their health care is more costly. That’s an important distinction.

In 2009, for example, the per-person annual cost of the typical Medicare recipient was $9,736 -- three times higher than for someone under 65. In Massachusetts, Medicare and Medicaid account for 37 percent of what the state spends on health care.

So we looked for better comparisons. We contacted the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the agency behind the national data cited by Roberts' office, to see if they had state-by-state comparisons. They did, but only up to 2009, three years after then-Gov. Mitt Romney signed health-care reform.

We took the data and did some calculations. In 2009, the per-person cost for all health care in Massachusetts (including Medicare and Medicaid) rose by 3.94 percent, compared with the national average of 3.79 percent. Cost increases in Massachusetts were above the U.S. average in the two previous years as well.

A third document Tocco sent us -- a March 2012 report from the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation -- provided limited support for Roberts’ statement. The foundation found that the average annual growth rate for family health insurance premiums from 2006 (when Romneycare passed) through 2010 rose by 4.5 percent in Massachusetts and by 5.1 percent nationally. That's lower, but not ""far below"" the national trend, as Roberts claimed.

What about costs for health insurance for individuals? Anna Gosline, director of policy and research for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation, sent us comparable data for that same period showing that individual health insurance premium costs grew a bit faster under Romneycare, by 5.1 percent compared to 4.7 percent nationally.

But we did find data points for just one year in the Blue Cross numbers that support Roberts' claim. In 2010, the latest year for which data are available, family premiums in Massachusetts fell by 0.8 percent ($127 per year) versus a rise of 6.5 percent ($844) nationally. For individuals, premiums rose by 2.8 percent in Massachusetts and 5.8 percent nationally. So particularly for family plans, for that one year, Roberts is right on target.

But, again, there are problems with the data. The numbers are based on an annual nationwide survey of employers by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

""That doesn't include any out-of-pocket costs,"" Gosline warned. ""What if that dip is caused by everyone doubling their deductibles?""

In other words, people might be spending less on their health insurance premiums but paying more out of pocket. The Massachusetts Division of Health Care Finance and Policy report says there’s evidence that such ""benefit buy-down"" is occurring.

Said Gosline: ""I think the longer-period view shows that Massachusetts was growing at about the same rate as the U.S. before reform was implemented in 2007, and about the same rate after, with some evidence of a recent slowdown.""
  
  
Our ruling

During a debate in which she argued that the health-care overhaul in Massachusetts has brought down costs, Lt. Governor Elizabeth Roberts said, ""Massachusetts is reporting a trend far below the national trend in the escalation of healthcare costs in this year.""

We couldn’t find state-by-state numbers for health-care costs for this year, last year, or 2010.

But in 2009, three years after Mitt Romney signed the legislation, total per-person spending in Massachusetts was slightly higher than the national average.

Only if you look at health insurance costs in 2010 -- particularly family plans -- do you see increases in Massachusetts far below the national average.

But one year does not make a trend. Other factors may have been at work to make 2010 a good year for insurance purchasers.

And during the other three years when health insurance reform was in effect in Massachusetts, the trend was that insurance rates and overall costs of health care went up faster than the national average.

As a result, we rate her statement ""Mostly False.""

Wes Riddle says ""misery index"" higher in October 2011 than any time since Reagan succeeded Carter
","
Wes Riddle, who seeks to represent a new congressional district twisting from western Hays and Travis counties north to a sliver of Tarrant County, fired up a crowd last year by suggesting President Barack Obama was making history in a crummy way.

Riddle, a retired Army lieutenant colonel now poised for a July 31, 2012, runoff with former Texas Secretary of State Roger Williams for the Republican nomination in the district, spoke at the Oct. 22, 2011, Austin Lone Star LiberTEA Fest rally, according to a DVD distributed by his campaign.

""Ronald Reagan said that status quo is Latin, Latin for the mess we're in,"" he said. ""And folks, we are in a heck of a status quo, let me tell you. How is that hope and change going for you? Are you better off than you were three years ago?""

A moment later, Riddle added: ""The misery index is the highest that it's been since Ronald Reagan took over from Jimmy Carter."" Memorably, Reagan cited the ""misery index"" -- meaning the nation’s combined inflation and unemployment rates -- as an indicator that Carter merited replacement; voters agreed.

We looked into whether Riddle was right that as of October 2011, the misery index was higher than at any time since Reagan became president.

Online, we found a website showing the misery index for every month since January 1948. Economist Arthur Okun, an adviser to President Lyndon Johnson, devised the index. ""A combination of rising inflation and more people out of work implies a deterioration in economic performance and a rise in the misery index,"" the site says. 
In a June 3, 2011, article, our friends at FactCheck.org pointed out that the index hit monthly highs of 13.63 under President Truman in January 1948; 17.01 in President Nixon's last full month in office, July 1974; 19.9 under President Ford in January 1975; and a record 21.98 under President Carter in June 1980.

When Reagan won election, inflation was the prime mover of the index, though unemployment has been dominant lately. In April 2012, for instance, the index was 10.4, based on 8.1 percent unemployment and the inflation rate of 2.3. That was down from the highest index on Obama’s watch, 12.87 in August and September 2011, according to the index website.

We checked Riddle’s claim against the index site, learning that he did not account for the misery index in the early part of Reagan’s presidency.

The site, registered to NPA Services, Inc., in Richmond Hill, New York, says it collects unemployment rates from the U.S. Department of Labor and inflation rates from InflationData.com. By email, the site’s webmaster, John Naudus, told us he maintains the site in his spare time. We spot-checked annual unemployment and inflation figures for the decades at issue. Naudus’s site aligns with the unemployment rates on the labor department’s site and annual inflation figures on inflationdata.com.

According to the misery index site, the index in Carter’s last year as president, 1980, was 20.76. In every subsequent year through 2011, the index was less than that.

With Obama as president, the index increased from 8.94 in 2009 to 12.11 in 2011, according to the misery index site. However, that was not the highest index since Reagan succeeded Carter. According to the site, the index was higher than Obama’s one-year high of 12.11 each of the first three years of Reagan’s presidency: 17.97 in 1981, 15.87 in 1982 and 12.82 in 1983.

For greater precision, we looked at the index month by month. This enabled us to compare the index in October 2011, when Riddle spoke, to the index for every previous month starting with Reagan’s presidency.

The October 2011 misery index was 12.43, based on the 8.9 percent unemployment rate plus the month’s 3.53 percent inflation, according to the site.

And does that 12.43 misery index outpace any such index since Reagan succeeded Carter?

Hardly. According to the site, the index was higher in a couple of earlier months of Obama’s term and barely higher, at 12.60, in November 1990, when George H.W. Bush was president.

Arguably, these instances are close enough for comfort.

Still, Reagan experienced higher misery indexes at the start of his presidency. The index exceeded 14 for Reagan’s first 25 months as president, according to the index site, and remained greater than 13 from February through May 1983.

By email, Brad Heritage of Riddle’s campaign sent a statement from Riddle saying the government changed how it calculates inflation and unemployment after 1980 and as a result, the index is lower of late than it would have been before the changes. A Bureau of Labor Statistics economist, Jacqueline Midkiff, told us the bureau does not agree that methodology changes weaken or invalidate unemployment rate/inflation rate comparisons across decades. She pointed out an August 2008 bureau article on inflation-rate myths and a 1994 bureau paper including information on comparing jobless rates over time. 
Our ruling

When Riddle spoke, the U.S. misery index was 12.43 -- higher than the index over much of the previous 30 years. 
Riddle said, though, that the index was the highest it had been since Reagan succeeded Carter. That's not correct. The index was higher for nearly 30 months of Reagan’s presidency. His statement fails to account for the index’s full history. We rate his claim as False.",/factchecks/2012/jun/08/wes-riddle/wes-riddle-says-misery-index-higher-october-2011-a/

Paul Sadler says Grady Yarbrough ran twice statewide as Republican
","
Paul Sadler, a former legislator who is in a July 2012 runoff for the Democratic Party U.S. Senate nomination, told the Hispanic Caucus at the Texas Democratic Party state convention in Houston: ""I’m running against a gentleman from San Antonio that ran as a Republican statewide twice.""

Sadler was referring to Grady Yarbrough, a retired schoolteacher who made the July 31 runoff in the May primary by finishing second to Sadler, who carried 35 percent to Yarbrough’s 26 percent.

And has Yarbrough run previously for statewide office -- as a Republican?

That’s so, according to a June 1, 2012, Houston Chronicle news article, which says this year Yarbrough is making his fourth statewide race. The story says he sought the 1986 and 1990 Republican nominations for state land commissioner and the 1994 Democratic nomination for state treasurer.

According to election results posted online by the state, Yarbrough lost the 1994 Democratic primary for state treasurer to incumbent Martha Whitehead. The Texas Secretary of State’s office does not post the 1990 and 1986 primary results online, so we looked via the Nexis service for old news accounts mentioning Yarbrough’s runs as a Republican.

According to a February 20, 1994, Dallas Morning News news article, Yarbrough, then a Tyler high school teacher, had run in 1986 and 1990 as a Republican for state land commissioner, losing runoffs both years.

""This year,"" the Morning News story says, ""he not only changed his political affiliation but also the spelling of his name, listing himself in his application for a place on the Democratic primary ballot as ‘Grady Yarborough.’"" The story quotes Yarbrough as saying he made the name change for the ballot to counter allegations made by his opponent in the 1990 land commissioner's race that he was simply running then because ""Yarbrough"" prompted sympathetic sentiment, a reference to Ralph Yarborough, who had been one of the state’s U.S. senators.

According to a June 7, 1986, Associated Press news story, Yarbrough lost the 1986 Republican runoff to M.D. Anderson, Jr., who had fended off criticism that he was trying to capitalize on his name matching the name of the well-known cancer treatment center.

Finally, we reached Yarbrough, who confirmed his past Republican runs, saying of Sadler: ""He’s trying to use a smear campaign, huh?""

In a telephone interview, Yarbrough said he was invited by a Tyler friend to help the Republican Party in about 1984 and volunteered to help Republican Bill Clements make his successful last run for governor in 1986. Yarbrough said he left the GOP after the party’s chairman in 1990 refused to condemn another candidate for the party's land commissioner nomination who had offended Yarbrough by saying that his name was adapted from slave holders. The opponent, Yarbrough told us, ""should not have brought that up."" 
Yarbrough said he became a Democrat after the 1990 race because he felt he was no longer welcome in the Republican Party.

Jeanne Shaheen says tax loopholes total $1.1 trillion
","
Military and  entitlement spending may be among the country’s biggest expenses. But, with more than $1 trillion in tax revenue sacrificed each year, cutting expenses may not be the only way to solve the country’s deficit woes, according to U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.

""We spend in tax loopholes annually $1.1 trillion,"" Shaheen said during a May 31, 2012 meeting with The Telegraph editorial board. ""That’s more than we spend on our defense budget in a year, on Medicare or Medicaid in a year. … So we’ve got to deal with the revenue side because we just can’t get there (with spending cuts alone).""

Tax loopholes have generated a lot of discussion during the election season, which has been dominated by discussion of the wealthiest 1 percent versus the other 99 percent. But, the premise that the U.S. gives away $1.1 trillion in loopholes is an intriguing concept. PolitiFact decided to take a look.

To start, we reached out to Shaheen’s office, which pointed us to the White House. As part of its Fiscal Year 2013 budget proposal, the White House’s Office of Management and Budget keeps a spreadsheet of tax expenditures, which includes all tax exclusions, exemptions, deductions and credits, among other revenue losses, do match Shaheen’s $1.1 trillion figure, adding up to $1.172 trillion to be exact.

That number does exceed the entire defense budget. For Fiscal Year 2013, the White House projects $700 billion in defense spending - down from $709 billion in FY2012 and up from 699 in FY2011, according to the President’s 2013 budget proposal.

The $1.1 trillion figure also beats out the numbers for Medicare and Medicaid, as Shaheen claimed. According to the budget proposal, the country will spend $528 billion on Medicare in 2013, along with $283 billion on Medicaid.

So, the numbers line up. But, does the language? Do the tax expenditures meet Shaheen’s characterization of loopholes? That leaves more room for debate.

According to the White House, the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 defines tax expenditures as ""revenue losses attributable to provisions of the Federal tax laws which allow a special exclusion, exemption, or deduction from gross income or which provide a special credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax liability.""

In short, expenditures include all deductions, exemptions, credits and other programs that lead to revenue losses from the tax system. But are those really loopholes? For example, can the popular home mortgage deduction -- a key part of most families' 1040s -- be considered a loophole?

Contacted later, Shaheen's office referred to the Webster’s Dictionary definition of ""loophole,"" which defines the term as ""a means of evading an obligation,"" according to Jonathan Lipman, her communications director.

""All tax expenditures, by definition, allow taxpayers to avoid paying the full tax rate,"" Lipman wrote in an e-mail to the Telegraph.

But, some tax analysts take a different view.

The list of tax exemptions certainly includes many ways for individuals and businesses to evade their tax obligations. But they also include many basic elements of our tax system, according to Donald Marron, director of the Tax Policy Center, an analyst group led by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.

These include exemptions for social security benefits, state and local taxes, veterans pensions and employee benefits, among hundreds of others.

To do away with these expenditures would be to rewrite major facets of the federal tax structure, said Marron, former interim director of the Congressional Budget Office, who wrote the article ""How Large Are Tax Expenditures? A 2012 Update.""

""Some tax expenditures are loopholes, but a lot of them are very broad economic or social policies,"" he said. ""They’re fundamental choices about how we choose to define our tax system.""

For example, removing the tax exclusion for employer health insurance contributions could take more from workers’ paychecks, and eliminating the deduction for interest on student loans could drive students deeper into debt.

""(Loophole) is a very common term used on both sides, but I think, when people look behind what those expenditures were, that's not what comes to mind,"" added Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Our ruling:

The official definition aside, we think loophole conjures images of a narrow tax break that gives a special -- and, in many cases, unfair -- advantage to a specific constituency. But we don't think the entire list of tax deductions, exemptions, credits fits that definition.

She's right about the total cost of those ""expenditures,"" but her definition of loophole is a big stretch.
