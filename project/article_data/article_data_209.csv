Burnam claim about Russia having greater partisan representation than Texas is misleading
","A Democratic Texas legislator said the Republican governor, Rick Perry, has no basis for characterizing his indictments by a Travis County grand jury as a partisan attack. According to an Aug. 22, 2014, news blog post by the Dallas Morning News, state Rep. Lon Burnam of Fort Worth that day called Perry a ""master of disinformation"" on a conference call with reporters hosted by the Democratic National Committee. Burnam, the blog post said, accused Perry of trying to shrug off the charges against him as political payback for his veto of funding for the Public Integrity Unit, part of the Travis County district attorney’s office that polices state officials. Burnam said for Perry to complain that the unit had one-sidedly pursued Republicans was an attempt at misdirection. ""When you have one-party rule for 20 years, most of the people who are going to be indicted for anything are going to be from that one party,"" Burnam said. ""Russia has more diversity in its governmental representation than we do in Texas,"" he said. Hold on. Russia enjoys greater partisan representation than two-party Texas? We were intrigued. By the numbers For decades, of course, Texas has been reliably Republican. A Democrat hasn’t won statewide since 1994, Republicans have held every statewide elected office since 1999 and the GOP has retained majorities in the Texas House and Senate since 2003. Most recently, in the 2013 Legislature, Republicans held a 19-12 Senate advantage once Houston Democrat Sylvia Garcia was sworn into her seat at mid-session. Republicans had a 95-55 advantage in the House, according to a January 2013 tally by the Legislative Reference Library. Put another way, Republicans hold 63 percent of the state’s House and Senate seats and 100 percent of the statewide judicial and executive positions. Now, how about Russia? By telephone and email, Burnam said he based his declaration of Russia’s greater diversity on research by Tom ""Smitty"" Smith, director of Public Citizen’s Texas office, especially a breakdown of 2011 election results on a Russian elections and public opinion website, russiavotes.org, indicating seven parties drew votes for seats in the State Duma, or parliament, in the elections of Dec. 4, 2011. Members of United Russia, the party of Russia President Dmitriy Medvedev, drew 49 percent of the vote, followed by the Communist Party (19 percent), Fair Russia (14 percent), Liberal Democrats (12 percent) and Yabloko, Patriots of Russia and Right Cause, each at 1 percent or less. According to the information, four parties ultimately landed seats in the parliament. United Russia got 238 seats (53 percent); the Communist Party won 92 (20 percent); Fair Russia ended up with 64 (14 percent); and the Liberal Democrats drew 56 (12 percent). That’s right, according to the entry for Russia’s political parties in the CIA’s World Fact Book, which says that while 78 political parties were registered with Russia's Ministry of Justice as of January 2014, only the four parties had representation in its legislature. Burnam’s point: Russia has twice as many parties represented in its government than Texas. When is a party count not reflective of partisan differences? In Russia But there's more to consider, we were told by Russia experts. The academics we reached said it’s misleading to judge partisan representation just by counting parties. Only one of the parties with seats in Russia's State Duma -- Fair Russia -- might be considered critical of its chief of state, Vladimir Putin, Jonathan Ludwig, a senior lecturer at Rice University, said by email. Fair Russia members, he said, have voted against government budgets, and one member even voted against the country’s 2014 annexation of Crimea (though he’s not beloved, per a March 20, 2014, Washington Post news story). Meantime, the Liberal Democrats, Ludwig said, often vote in lockstep with Putin. ""The Communist Party allies with Putin on supporting the close ties to the Russian Orthodox Church and in the anti-gay legislation (a holdover from Soviet-era laws),"" Ludwig wrote. Based on how parliamentary votes break down, Ludwig said, generally ""there is a strong inclination to line up behind the Kremlin, i.e., Putin."" Graeme Robertson, a University of North Carolina specialist in Russian politics, similarly said the parties in the State Duma ""are more or less acceptable to the regime and really critical opposition groups are not allowed to contest the elections, so diversity is in fact much more limited than it appears. At the state level the same 4 parties and one or two others are represented but United Russia holds a majority in all states (all 83),"" Robertson emailed. ""So again, not much diversity there."" Since 2012, Robertson said, ""the Duma has become even more of a rubber-stamp than it was before… This is the sort of thing that is so widely accepted among observers that few people would go to the bother of actually writing it up."" By phone, Columbia University political scientist Timothy Frye, director of the Harriman Institute, formerly the Russian Institute, said there was greater diversity in Russian politics in the 1990s but since 2004, he said, the opposition parties are ""allowed to hold their seats at the discretion of the ruling party."" Of late, Frye said, ""there are elections, there are campaigns; they’re all carefully controlled. There’s more appearance of diversity than actual diversity."" By email, Burnam said if he had time to further research his point, it might be a hard call ""on the question of diversity in the quality of the members of the respective legislative bodies as opposed to the obvious diversity in the numbers of people representing what party."" There is more ""actual party diversity in Russia than there is in Texas,"" he said. Our ruling Burnam said: ""Russia has more diversity in its governmental representation than we do in Texas."" We see a thread of truth here in that four parties have seats in the State Duma; just two parties hold legislative seats in Texas. But there’s little diversity permitted from the parties in the parliament, authorities advise. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Fatal police shootings occur in tiny percentage of arrests in U.S., Milwaukee's police chief says
","In the wake of the fatal police shooting in Ferguson, Mo., Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn was interviewed for nearly an hour on Wisconsin Public Radio about the incident and its implications. At one point during the Aug. 20, 2014 interview, Flynn told host Kathleen Dunn ""there are many reasons why (police) uses of force are dramatically down, and the main one is training."" Then, alluding back to Ferguson, the chief added: ""It's an extraordinarily rare event. But the fact is, (in) 2012, there were 12,197,000 arrests in the United States, OK? And there were 410 uses of deadly force. Now that is, I think, three-thousands of a percent. So, it’s still an extraordinarily rare event."" In the comparison Flynn uses, there is one police killing in 0.00003 percent of all arrests -- an even tinier fraction than he suggested. But expressed another way, the 410 is an average of more than one police killing per day. So, what about the two figures themselves: Are they accurate and do they account for all of the people who are killed by police? Renewed focus Around the country, attention to the use of deadly force by police was heightened after Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, was shot to death on Aug. 9, 2014, in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb. In Milwaukee, residents held rallies to raise questions about the Brown case and about the April 2014 death of Dontre Hamilton, a 31-year-old who was shot multiple times by a police officer during a struggle in Red Arrow Park in downtown Milwaukee. (In Milwaukee, there was one police killing of a citizen in 2012, four in 2013 and two through late August of 2014, the Police Department told us.) PolitiFact National rated Half True a claim by conservative talk show host Michael Medved that ""more whites than blacks are victims of deadly police shootings."" The claim ignored the fact that there are more than five times more whites than blacks in America. And our colleagues rated as False a statement that an unarmed black person is shot by a police officer every 28 hours. The report that had been cited by CNN pundit Marc Lamont Hill looked at all deaths, not just those of unarmed individuals. And it rolled in some deaths that did not involve police officers. Flynn’s claim Flynn, who headed the police departments in Arlington, Va., and Springfield, Mass., before becoming Milwaukee’s chief in 2008, is known nationally for his use of data. When we asked for evidence for Flynn’s claim, a Milwaukee police spokesman cited two FBI reports. Both are from 2012, the most recent full-year statistics available. There were 12,196,959 arrests across the country in 2012, which means the figure Flynn used -- 12,197,000 -- was rounded up only slightly. The highest numbers of those arrests were for drug abuse violations, driving under the influence and larceny-theft. There were also 410 cases of justifiable homicide in 2012, according to the FBI, which defines justifiable homicide as the killing of a felon by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty. For example: A police officer responding to a bank robbery alarm who shot a suspect after the suspect fired at the officer. But that doesn’t taken into account all police killings of citizens. FiveThirtyEight.com, a news website devoted to data analysis, recently reported that the 410 is a minimum figure. The numbers are self-reported by local police agencies and not audited, not all police agencies report those figures to the FBI and the number doesn’t include homicides that weren’t ruled justifiable. The FBI totals are likely an undercount for another reason, criminologists told us. Researchers who examine police killings of citizens within large metropolitan police departments often find that the number of such incidents recorded by the departments are higher than the number of justifiable homicides reported by the FBI. But the criminologists also noted Flynn’s comparison is one legitimate way to measure the frequency of police killings.   Our rating Flynn said that in 2012, there were nearly 12.2 million arrests and ""410 uses of deadly force"" by police in the United States. The Milwaukee police chief correctly quotes official FBI statistics on arrests and justifiable homicides by law enforcement officers, although it appears the 410 is an undercount of the number of people killed by police. We rate his statement Mostly True.

American LeadHERship PAC says Providence has had 100 shootings each year of Angel Taveras' tenure
","A political action committee backing Rhode Island Treasurer Gina Raimondo for governor is leveling a series of attacks against one of her opponents in the Sept. 9 Democratic primary, Angel Taveras, mayor of Providence. In a four-page pamphlet mailed to voters by the American LeadHERship PAC, one of the attacks focused on crime, noting that, under Taveras, there had been cuts to the police budget and the size of the force had fallen to its lowest number in years. Then came this claim:  ""There have been at least 100 shootings each year Taveras has been mayor."" (The claim was repeated in large print in a subsequent mailing.) PolitiFact Rhode Island last examined Providence's crime statistics in a July 24, 2014 item after Taveras said, ""If you look at what we’ve done over the last several years, the crime rate has actually gone down in [Providence] and . . . the number of shootings has been going down.""  We ruled the mayor’s claim Half True because the trends weren't that clear-cut. For example, the crime rate actually ticked up during his first year in office, only to subsequently come down. For this fact check we will review the statistics on the number of people shot in the city. (Police do not tally the number of reports of shots being fired, a statistic the city doesn't keep because it can be impossible to tell the difference between a gun going off and fireworks, for example.   The LeadHERship pamphlet cites a July 26, 2014, story in The Providence Journal that refers to ""a constant drumbeat of violence in the capital city over the past three years with more than 100 shootings annually."" That covers 2011-2013. And what about 2014? When we emailed American LeadHERship PAC founder Kate Coyne-McCoy to find out if the total had reach 100 for 2014, she referred us to our July 24 PolitiFact item, which reported 61 shootings through July 12, 2014. The total was 69 as of this writing, so it could hit 100 by year's end, but it's not even close to that yet. So the number of shootings has not hit 100 for ""each year"" of the Taveras administration. The LeadHERship statement also ignores some significant context: The number of shootings, which peaked at 108 in 2011, declined in the subsequent two years of Taveras' tenure, dropping to 105 in 2012 and 100 in 2013. Before Taveras took office, the numbers were lower but steadily increasing. The annual total was 47 shootings in 2006 (during the tenure of his predecessor, David Cicilline), 58 in 2007, 77 in 2008, 86 in 2009, and 90 in 2010, Cicilline's final year, before jumping sharply to 108 during Taveras' first year. Because the statement is mostly accurate but ignores important context, we rate it Mostly True.

Megyn Kelly: Al Sharpton declared Michael Brown 'didn't use any deadly force' against officer
","Fox News has a major bone to pick with its left-leaning rival, MSNBC, and that bone is Al Sharpton. Bill O’Reilly, Howard Kurtz and Megyn Kelly are just some of the Fox hosts calling out Sharpton for, they say, crossing ethical lines and tarnishing MSNBC’s coverage of Michael Brown’s death in Ferguson, Mo. At issue: Sharpton’s dual roles as host of MSNBC’s Politics Nation and advocate for Brown’s family in events that followed his fatal shooting by police officer Darren Wilson, including giving the eulogy at Brown’s Aug. 25 funeral. Even worse to the Fox News gang is how much President Barack Obama’s administration is leaning on Sharpton as ""a de facto contact and conduit"" on race issues, according to a Politico Magazine profile. Appearing on The O’Reilly Factor on the same night as Brown’s funeral, Kelly criticized Sharpton for getting ahead of the facts in his fiery speeches to emotional crowds. It was the same segment in which she and O’Reilly debated the concept of ""white privilege,"" with Kelly presenting several economic, social and educational statistics to show how blacks are disadvantaged in this country. ""What they don't need in this case, or in any case, is people like Al Sharpton going in there and declaring as a matter of fact that the, that Michael Brown didn't use any deadly force or posed no deadly threat to the officer,"" Kelly said. O’Reilly said, ""Absolutely, that just alienates everybody."" ""If you have somebody come in and prejudge -- someone you trust and rely upon -- come and tell you the facts are one way, you believe him,"" Kelly said of Sharpton. ""That's why he is abusing his power."" We wanted to know if Sharpton flat-out said Brown ""didn’t use any deadly force"" before he was killed. What happened The official story of what happened before Brown was shot at least six times is not entirely known -- a factor driving the unrest against law enforcement. A grand jury is weighing evidence in the case and will decide whether to indict Wilson, and the St. Louis County Police Department and FBI are investigating the shooting. CNN and Vox have compiled guides to varying accounts from witnesses and law enforcement about what happened. Before noon, there was an alleged strong-arm robbery involving Brown and friend Dorian Johnson at a convenience store. Shortly after, Wilson stopped the men for walking in the middle of a street, without knowing they were suspects in the robbery, Ferguson’s police chief has said. Some witnesses and Brown’s advocates say Brown had been shot and was turning around to face Wilson with his hands raised when Wilson fired at him again, hitting his head. Wilson told police that Brown assaulted him, pushed him inside of his patrol car, and tried to grab his handgun, and the town’s police chief said Wilson sought medical care for his swollen face after the altercation. We won’t go into more detail in this fact-check about the various accounts, but we thought it was important to highlight how the narratives conflict. We may never know what really happened, said David Klinger, associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at University of Missouri-St Louis.  ""For anybody who hasn’t seen the investigative case file to say that he categorically is confident that it was not possible that Mr. Brown posed a threat to Officer Wilson’s life, he is simply wrong,"" Klinger said. What Sharpton said About a week before Brown’s funeral, Sharpton addressed Ferguson residents at a unity rally. Sharpton says he was invited to town by Brown’s grandfather. Sharpton decried the release of security footage from the convenience store as a post-mortem smear of Brown’s character that did nothing to illuminate what happened before he died. ""But the issue is not whether he shoplifted. The issue is not what he did before,"" Sharpton said Aug. 17. ""The issue is how a young man with no deadly threat, no life-extenuating circumstances, was shot multiple times. That’s the issue, and that’s the issue America has got to deal with."" Kelly highlighted this part of his speech in her Aug. 19 edition of The Kelly File and alluded to it on O’Reilly’s show Aug. 25. Sharpton’s defense: I’m not ‘Walter Cronkite’ Sharpton defended himself in an interview with PunditFact. He does not deny that he said essentially what Kelly described. But he said his audience knows his point of view and that he was giving his opinion that Brown posed ""no deadly threat"" because he was unarmed. No one disputes that Brown did not have a gun. ""People don’t think that I’m Walter Cronkite reporting the news,"" he said. ""That’s my opinion, just like they’re giving their opinion on white privilege."" He shifted his rhetoric a bit when asked about Kelly’s specific qualm, saying he believes there is no ""apparent"" evidence that Brown posed a deadly threat. Sharpton also said, if anything, O’Reilly and other Fox News hosts are just as guilty of expressing their viewpoints. ""If (O’Reilly) can write books and all of them over there can write books on their opinions, how can you tell me don’t go to a rally on my opinion?"" Sharpton said. ""We’re all advocates. I use my feet to advocate, they use the pen to advocate."" Kelly could not be reached through a Fox spokeswoman or Twitter. Our ruling In criticizing Sharpton, Kelly said, Sharpton went to Ferguson, Mo., and is ""declaring as a matter of fact that ... Michael Brown didn't use any deadly force or posed no deadly threat to the officer."" That’s not exactly what Sharpton said, but it’s pretty close. The only possible caveat is Sharpton says he was speaking as a matter of opinion based on what he had so far, more than a matter of fact. That’s in the eye of the beholder. Kelly’s statement is accurate. We rate it True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809710C140>],/factchecks/2014/aug/28/megyn-kelly/megyn-kelly-al-sharpton-declared-michael-brown-did/
"['National', 'Corporations', 'Taxes', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Bernie Sanders says tax share paid by corporations has fallen from 33% to 9% since 1952
","As politicians and commentators were criticizing decisions by companies to shift their corporate headquarters overseas in order to cut their tax bill to Uncle Sam, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., created a shareable meme to illustrate how much corporate tax collection has plunged over the past few decades. The meme says: ""Want to better understand why we have a federal deficit? In 1952, the corporate income tax accounted for 33 percent of all federal tax revenue. Today, despite record-breaking profits, corporate taxes bring in less than 9 percent. It’s time for real tax reform."" A reader asked us to check his claim, so we did. First, we can confirm that corporate profits are very near an all-time high. This chart from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis shows that corporate profits after taxes as a percentage of gross domestic product hit their historical peak in the third quarter of 2013, before dropping marginally since then. But what about corporate taxes as a percentage of all federal tax revenue? Sanders is basically on the mark here, too. Here’s the relevant historical data from the Office of Management and Budget. The first chart shows 1952. The first row features raw dollars and the second row shows the percentage of all tax revenues that particular tax represented: 1952 taxes Individual income taxes Corporate income taxes Social insurance and retirement taxes Excise taxes Other taxes Total tax revenue $27.9 billion $21.2 billion $6.4 billion $8.9 billion $818 million $65.3 billion 43 percent 33 percent 10 percent 14 percent 1 percent 100 percent   And here’s the data for 2013: 2013 taxes Individual income taxes Corporate income taxes Social insurance and retirement taxes Excise taxes Other taxes Total tax revenue $1.3 trillion $274 billion $948 billion $84 billion $19 billion $2.6 trillion 50 percent 10 percent 36 percent 3 percent 1 percent 100 percent   So, corporate taxes accounted for 33 percent of all tax revenue in 1952 but just 10 percent in 2013. The 2013 figure is slightly higher than what Sanders said, but his claim is basically accurate on the numbers. That said, the measurement Sanders used may not be the best. Economists told us that it would be more useful to know what corporate taxes were as a percentage of gross domestic product. But looking at it that way, the general pattern also holds. In 1952, corporate taxes accounted for 5.9 percent of GDP, a figure that has fallen to 1.6 percent today. So Sanders has a point that corporate tax collections have plummeted as a percentage of all taxes collected, even as corporate profits have hit record highs. But a range of economists offered two bits of cautionary context worth considering. • The year 1952 is somewhat cherry-picked. That year ranks third-highest in history for corporate taxes as a percentage of GDP. ""It was a time when the U.S. was the colossus of the world economy and faced very little competition from foreign-based firms,"" said Daniel Mitchell, a Cato Institute economist. That said, even as recently as 1979, corporate taxes accounted for 2.6 percent of GDP, a full percentage point higher than today. So the decline is real, even if you use a subsequent year. • Today, most business income is taxed through the individual income tax code, rather than the corporate code. This concerns a distinction only a CPA could love. One type of corporation, a ""C-corporation,"" pays corporate income taxes on its profits. Another type, the ""S-corporation,"" pays taxes on its profits through the individual income-tax returns of the owner. ""Changes in tax rates and rules for C- and S-corps contributed to more firms becoming S-corps and thus paying individual rather than corporate income tax,"" said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist with the Tax Foundation. That has boosted individual income-tax collections and reduced corporate income-tax collections. Between 1980 to 2010, the category of businesses that includes S-corporations, sole proprietorships, partnerships and LLCs has increased by 10.9 million to over 30 million, while the number of corporations has declined, Pomerlau said. This means there are fewer corporations to pay the corporate income tax. In addition, the amount of business income generated by these types of businesses has risen as well, Pomerlau said. Between 1980 and 2010, this type of income has increased fivefold, from $320 billion to more than $1.6 trillion, he said.   ""In fact, most recent data shows that (these) businesses are earning more total net income than traditional C-corporations,"" Pomerlau said. ""In 1980, it was the complete opposite."" Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, agreed that looking at C-corporations alone produces a cloudy picture. ""It's hard to say what share of revenue would come from corporate income tax today if those changes hadn't occurred,"" he said. Our ruling Sanders said, ""In 1952, the corporate income tax accounted for 33 percent of all federal tax revenue. Today, despite record-breaking profits, corporate taxes bring in less than 9 percent."" Sanders is right if you use the official numbers, but it’s worth noting that the figure for individual income taxes now includes a significant chunk of taxes assessed on corporate profits. That muddies the otherwise clear picture Sanders tries to paint. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970B0AC0>],/factchecks/2014/aug/28/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-tax-share-paid-corporations-ha/

Medical marijuana amendment allows patient to 'get it forever,' doctor says
","Opponents have made many arguments against Florida’s proposed medical marijuana amendment, but here’s a new one: They say patients would be able to get an unlimited amount of pot should the measure pass. Dr. Rafael Miguel, director of the Sarasota Memorial Institute for Advanced Medicine's Pain Medicine Program, was one of three representatives for Drug Free America who visited the Tampa Bay Times editorial board on Aug. 20. He joined Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri and Tallahassee attorney Susan Kelsey to discuss why the Sunshine State should shy away from Amendment 2 in November. Miguel offered several reasons why the medical establishment did not like the constitutional amendment. He said there was an unreasonable focus on marijuana’s smokeable form in order to obtain psychoactive effects, and added that the process by which doctors help patients get cannabis flies in the face of the prescription model of doling out drugs. Miguel focused on how ""recommendations"" to use marijuana are not prescriptions, and that they don’t allow doctors to control the amount and dosage patients consume, or for how long they consume it. ""You don't get refills -- you get it forever,"" Miguel said. ""There's no regulation on consumption."" PolitiFact Florida has written about the amendment’s guidelines before, but we were curious in this case whether doctors who recommend medical marijuana to patients would indeed have no say in how much or for how long their patients could take it. Following guidelines Medical marijuana is legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia. (Colorado and Washington state have gone a step further by legalizing cannabis for recreational use, even though the cultivation, possession and use of the drug remains against federal law.) Doctors in states that allow medical marijuana don’t prescribe the drug -- that could potentially lead to federal sanctions, since the U.S. government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug. Inclusion on that list means, legally, that marijuana has no known medical benefits, even though that claim is much disputed. Instead, in states that allow medical marijuana, doctors recommend people who suffer from certain approved conditions -- typically diseases like cancer, Parkinson’s disease, ALS, or other conditions causing chronic pain. States make their own rules for supplying the drug that vary from state to state. Florida’s Amendment 2 says that, should the initiative pass, the state Department of Health would create guidelines for the manufacture, distribution and use of marijuana. That worries opponents like Drug Free America; they argue that the language is too broad to limit the scope of the drug’s impact on the state. Miguel didn’t immediately return PolitiFact Florida’s request for more specifics about what he meant. During his editorial board visit he made it clear he preferred the FDA-approved process of writing prescriptions with a specified dosage, duration, potency and number of refills, using clinically tested drugs. The amendment doesn’t give doctors any of that control, Miguel said, and it doesn’t define any limit. In general, the measure says the state Department of Health will create regulations. However, the initiative does lay out some of the process. It defines a written ""physician certification"" as a document that says the doctor feels the patient has a condition that may be aided by the use of cannabis and specifies ""for how long the physician recommends the medical use of marijuana for the patient."" There also is a section that requires the Florida Department of Health to create ""a regulation that defines the amount of marijuana that could reasonably be presumed to be an adequate supply for qualifying patients’ medical use, based on the best available evidence."" That limit on quantity could be waived, depending on the patient’s condition. The language prevents a strict interpretation of how involved a doctor would be, said attorney Kelsey, who has criticized the amendment for being so vague it would eventually be challenged in the state supreme court. ""As I read it, the doctor doesn’t say the amount at all,"" Kelsey said. ""He just gives the patient the certification and it says for how long, then the patient gets their ID card and takes that to the dispensary and that is the point at which the quantity is determined and handed out."" So how is the drug distributed in states that allow it? Every state has different regulations for the process, but a good benchmark for Florida may be Nevada, because it passed medical marijuana as a constitutional amendment instead of as legislation. Colorado adopted constitutional amendments in 2000 and 2014, but the second one legalized recreational use, which the Florida Amendment does not do. Passed by voters in 2000, the Nevada amendment language was even shorter and more vague than the Florida proposal. It required the state Legislature to provide for a registry and to create guidelines, a process delegated to the state Department of Health and Human Services in subsequent legislation. As of 2013, Nevada limited patients to 2.5 ounces of marijuana every 14 days. Patients must get an ID card through a registry, and must renew their membership on the registry with a doctor’s approval every year. Even in states that allow patients to grow their own marijuana plants, there are legal limits to how much they can cultivate. It’s a moot point in Florida, because the amendment doesn’t allow for personal cultivation. Many laws or regulations also say doctors can tell the state agency in charge if they think a patient would no longer benefit from medical marijuana, according to Karen O’Keefe, state policy director at the Marijuana Policy Project, which favors regulations like Amendment 2. ""In most cases, the laws also specify that the card becomes void if the patient ceases to have the qualifying condition,"" O’Keefe said. ""I see no reason why regulators couldn’t include similar provisions in Florida."" Our ruling Miguel said when it comes to doctor’s recommendations for medical marijuana, ""You don't get refills, you get it forever."" He was referring to how a doctor’s ""recommendation"" for cannabis does not allow the same level of control as a medical prescription does. He said there was no written limitation on how much or for how long a patient could get marijuana in the amendment, a common criticism by opponents of the amendment. It’s possible that potential Florida regulations would not limit time on a registry or how long a doctor’s certification would last for a patient. But it would be premature, and speculative, to assume that there would be no way under the amendment to stop a recommendation from going on forever. Other states have created their own rules, limiting the quantity and frequency of the drug that patients can get.

NextGen ad says Rick Scott trying to 'hide from' donation related to drilling project
","NextGen Climate has unleashed another attack on Gov. Rick Scott as it relates to a drilling project that the state ultimately shut down. ""The Collier family, owners of the company that leased their land for oil exploration to the drillers that threatened drinking water for seven million Floridians,"" stated the narrator in the TV ad. ""Rick Scott took $200,000 from them and now he is trying to hide from it. Sound familiar?"" At that point, the screen shows a photo of Scott while the text states, ""He took the 5th 75 times."" The ad then replays video footage of Scott at a 1995 legal deposition saying, ""I don’t recall. I have no idea. What’s your question?"" PolitiFact Florida previously fact-checked a NextGen ad about that $200,000 donation, rating it Half True. And we have fact-checked a Florida Democratic Party ad about Scott taking the 5th 75 times and rated it Mostly True. Scott's pleading the 5th was related to a Medicare case, though, not oil drilling.  But this new ad tacked on another allegation that we will fact-check here: Is Scott trying to hide from this donation? The Colliers’ land and their donation Checking whether Scott is trying to ""hide from"" a donation requires a bit of backstory. In 2012, Collier Resources Co. leased about 120,000 acres of mineral rights in Collier County to Dan A. Hughes. Collier County is in Southwest Florida and includes Naples, where Scott lives. But despite residents’ protests -- including in front of Scott’s home -- the state Department of Environmental Protection in September 2013 granted Hughes a permit to inject acid deep underground to fracture the limestone. But Hughes wanted to try a procedure that hadn’t been allowed in Florida in the past. In December 2013, Hughes went ahead and used that procedure even though DEP had asked it to hold off. That led the department to fine Hughes and later file a lawsuit, which Hughes is fighting. The Collier family is not a party to the lawsuit. Nor is Scott in his personal capacity.  Why does this all matter for the ad? Because four members of the Collier family -- Barron, Miles, Parker and Thomas -- each gave $50,000 to Scott’s Let’s Get to Work Committee in January 2013. This led NextGen’s to allege in its previous ad that Scott was too cozy with oil interests: ""A dangerous new type of oil drilling near the Everglades threatened drinking water for 7 million Floridians,"" part of the ad states. ""But one Floridian is benefitting. Rick Scott drank from a fountain of campaign cash from the company that profited off pollution."" The text on the screen states: ""Rick Scott $200,000 from oil interests."" The ad didn’t mention Hughes, the oil drilling company, or the Colliers, the landowners who gave the donations, by name. Because the ad lacked those specifics, and because no pollution has been found so far, we rated it Half True. The newest NextGen ad takes this dispute a step further, saying Scott not only took the money but that ""he is trying to hide from it."" That’s a reference to an argument by the Scott campaign that it didn’t take donations from Hughes. The Miami Herald reported that Scott’s campaign spokesman, Matt Moon, strongly denied NextGen’s suggestion that Scott had taken campaign cash from Hughes, the driller. ""In fact, no political entity associated with Gov. Scott has ever received contributions from the company – in this election or 2010,"" Moon said. The Republican Party of Florida took a similar strategy in an ad, saying ""Crist’s team says Gov. Scott took contributions from this polluter. It’s total fiction. Scott didn’t take a nickel. Scott held the polluter accountable. Shut down the wells."" In fact, both sides are throwing up some fog here. The GOP is correct that Scott didn’t take a nickel from Hughes, but NextGen’s ad didn’t say he did. In the meantime, the Republicans are omitting a key point -- that Scott did take money from the Colliers, who are connected to the project referenced in the ad because they leased the land for the drilling. In the new ad, NextGen’s attack is somewhat careful in its wording. It didn’t say that Scott ""is trying to hide it."" That would have been more misleading -- these donations are a public record and Scott hasn’t done anything to restrict access to those records. Quite the contrary -- those donations have been reported by many media outlets, beginning in January 2013 when the Colliers first donated the money. But instead, NextGen said that Scott is trying to ""hide from"" the donations. There’s some truth there: When attacked over the donations, Scott’s camp released a statement that was essentially a misdirection. Scott’s statement failed to acknowledge that the landowners gave Scott’s campaign money, even though Hughes didn’t. Our ruling A NextGen ad says Rick Scott took $200,000 from the Collier family who leased their land for oil drilling ""and now he is trying to hide from it."" Actually, both sides are presenting self-interested portrayals of the truth. Scott called out NextGen for saying he had received Hughes’ money, but the group hadn’t explicitly claimed that he had, and the Scott campaign’s statement glossed over the fact that the campaign had indeed received money from Collier, a party who was integral to the drilling plan. For its part, NextGen’s charge that Scott is trying to ""hide from"" the Collier donations is exaggerated. The transaction was reported publicly per standard procedure, and there is no evidence that Scott has tried to restrict access to that information. Quite the contrary -- it has been discussed widely in media reports. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. So we rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C0C3C0>],/factchecks/2014/aug/28/next-generation-climate-action-committee/nextgen-ad-says-rick-scott-trying-hide-donation-re/

Pryor says Cotton voted 'no' on pandemic prevention bill, ignores Cotton's 'yes' vote
","While it’s highly unlikely that Ebola will make it to the United States, the pandemic has wormed its way into one of the most contentious U.S. Senate races -- in Arkansas. Despite the fears of many Americans, experts on infectious diseases -- including the Centers for Disease Control -- say there is a very, very low likelihood that the United States would experience an Ebola outbreak. Compared to west Africa, America has well-resourced health care services, as well as federal programs and agencies dedicated to preventing public health crises in the United States. But that’s no thanks to Rep. Tom Cotton, says incumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Pryor in his most recent ad. Pryor’s running against Cotton, a Republican, to keep his seat. ""Tom Cotton voted against preparing America for pandemics like Ebola,"" the ad’s narrator says. ""Congressman Cotton voted to cut billions from our nation’s medical disaster and emergency programs. He was the only Arkansas congressman to vote this way. Just like he was the only one to vote against Children’s Hospital. Instead, Cotton voted massive tax cuts for billionaires. Not protect our families’ health and safety."" As a tea party Republican, Cotton has a history of voting against federal government spending, including spending on disaster relief. But tying Cotton to a potential Ebola outbreak caught our attention. The vote This year, Ebola has killed more than 1,400 people in west Africa as of Aug. 20 and is the largest ever recorded outbreak, according to the World Health Organization. No cases have been recorded in the United States, though two American health care workers contracted the virus while in Liberia and were treated in an Atlanta hospital. We asked Pryor’s campaign for evidence backing up their claim, and they said the ad refers to the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013. The law -- passed in March 2013 -- continues funding various medical and public health emergency preparedness programs through 2018. (The first iteration of the law was passed in 2006.) As you might guess from the name, the law pertains to preventing pandemics, like Ebola, from breaking out in the United States. Several programs funded under the act are already working on Ebola response, such as the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, said Gretchen Michaels, a spokeswoman for the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services). Additionally, the law’s 2013 reauthorization gave the Food and Drug Administration the ability to authorize use of unapproved products in the case of an emergency. So earlier this month, the FDA authorized use of a new tool for diagnosing Ebola, as well as an experimental treatment.   Did Cotton try to stop this legislation? At first, it seems that way. The House passed the legislation Jan. 22, 2013, with strong bipartisan support and very little opposition -- 395 to 29. Cotton voted against it, along with 28 other Republicans. The bill moved on to the Senate, where lawmakers made a few changes, passed it by a voice vote, and sent it back to the House to approve the changes. The House once again passed the Senate’s version of the bill with an overwhelming majority from both parties. This time around, Cotton changed his position and voted for the bill. (Seven other Republicans who previously voted ""nay"" also changed their vote.) It’s not clear why Cotton didn’t vote for it the first time. The law passed with such little debate that it went over without much media attention. We reached out to Cotton’s campaign but haven’t heard back -- though they posted an article on their website refuting the claim.   According to CQ Weekly, the major difference between the House and Senate version of the act is that the House version approves funding and programs through 2017, while the Senate version goes through 2018. We also used a tool to compare differences between the two texts and found that the final version includes a clause clarifying that state and local workers asked to temporarily take on a different assignment in case of an emergency would not be required to accept that reassignment. Regardless, the country’s ability to address a pandemic does not hinge on either of those changes. There is no readily available evidence showing that Cotton actively campaigned against the bill. And the final version, which got Cotton’s vote, also got positive votes from nearly every Senate and House Democrat -- including Pryor. Our ruling A Pryor for Senate ad said, ""Tom Cotton voted against preparing America for pandemics like Ebola."" Cotton voted against one version of a 2013 pandemic and emergency preparedness bill. However, Cotton voted for the final version, which Pryor also supported. The bill easily became law. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097491C00>],/factchecks/2014/aug/28/mark-pryor/pryor-says-cotton-voted-no-pandemic-prevention-bil/

Democratic group claims Cory Gardner backs bill to 'ban all abortions'
","Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who’s running to unseat Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, is finding his stance on abortion targeted by another Democratic attack ad. We previously rated a Udall claim that Gardner ""championed"" an effort to ban birth control in Colorado as Half True. The latest 30-second spot, aired by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, features a handful of women criticizing the Colorado Republican’s pro-life stance. ""Why do guys like Cory Gardner think it’s any of their business to tell women what do?"" one woman asks. Another calls Gardner’s positions ""extreme,"" after a narrator says Gardner would ""ban abortions even in cases of rape and incest."" Later, the narrator adds: ""Gardner is sponsoring a bill to ban all abortions right now."" We decided to take a look at this last claim. The DSCC points to H.R. 1091, known formally as the Life At Conception Act and informally as a ""personhood"" bill. Gardner is listed as a cosponsor on the bill. The bill was introduced April 8, 2013, by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. According to the bill text, it would ""implement equal protection for the right to life of each born and preborn human person"" and ""declares that the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being."" It goes on to say that ""‘human person’ and ‘human being’ include each and every member of the species homo sapiens at all stages of life, including the moment of fertilization, cloning, or other moment at which an individual member of the human species comes into being."" If this sounds confusing to you, that’s because it is. None of the above mentions abortion, even though it’s quite clearly an anti-abortion measure. In fact, the only part of the bill that seems to directly reference abortion only further muddies the waters: ""Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize the prosecution of any woman for the death of her unborn child."" It’s difficult to weigh the impact of such a perplexing bill. On the one hand, the bill doesn’t explicitly carve out exemptions for cases that involve rape or incest or instances when the woman’s life or health is in danger. On the other hand, the bill doesn’t explicitly mention abortion in the first place. This means that judicial interpretation will play a big role in how any such law is implemented. But because no state has passed a personhood bill, courts have not established a track record about how they would interpret such a measure and how the measure would affect abortions. By suggesting that a fetus has the ""right to life,"" the bill challenges the Supreme Court’s past support for a constitutional right to abortion. An act of Congress cannot overrule the constitution, meaning the Supreme Court would have to change its past positions on abortion. That’s possible, but even if the bill is a vehicle to challenge Roe vs. Wade and subsequent decisions, it’s not clear that the outcome would ""ban all abortions."" Glenn Cohen, codirector of the Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics at Harvard University, said claiming that the personhood bill would ban all abortions ""might be a bit strong."" Depending on how courts rule, it might still be possible that exceptions could be made in cases where the mother’s life or health was at risk, he said. ""One could believe that fetuses are persons but still have those exceptions on a theory like self defense,"" Cohen said. Further complicating matters is that Gardner is straddling both sides of the issue. He has publicly stated that he no longer supports the personhood movement because of its potential affect on some FDA-approved birth control -- yet he has not taken his name off the bill as a cosponsor. Gardner’s campaign said his cosponsorship of the legislation is to ""reflect his belief that life begins at conception."" The campaign said Gardner is on record supporting exemptions for ""rape, incest, and life of the mother,"" and the campaign disagrees that the personhood bill amounts to a ban on all abortion. The bill is not expected to come up for a vote. Gardner is cosponsor of a different bill filed in 2013 that would take away federal funding for abortion providers except when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest or a physician certifies that the woman's life is in danger if she carries the baby to birth. Our ruling The DSCC said Gardner ""is sponsoring a bill to ban all abortions right now."" The claim is based on Gardner’s cosponsorship of a bill that grants a fetus the same rights as a person from the moment of fertilization. It’s clear that such personhood bills are anti-abortion measures, but there’s a lot of uncertainty in the bill’s language that would have to be sorted through, over time, by the court system, and it’s not clear that it would ban all abortions. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809679DEC0>],/factchecks/2014/aug/28/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/democratic-group-claims-cory-gardner-backs-bill-ba/

Bloggers say Wisconsin ranks last in income growth since Scott Walker became governor
","In the heat of a political campaign, no advantage gained by one side goes unnoticed by the other. We saw that again after rating True a very narrow and specific claim by Gov. Scott Walker that Wisconsin leads 11 other Midwestern states in personal income growth over the one-year period that ended with the first quarter of 2014. Shortly after Walker blasted out that news, readers and Internet bloggers were contending the picture is not nearly so bright if more of Walker’s tenure is considered. ""What if you examine the entire span of of the Walker administration?"" reader and frequent commenter Jim Spice asked in a comment Aug. 14, 2014, on JSOnline.com and on Facebook. His conclusion: ""I downloaded the data set from the BEA web site, and ran the numbers using 2010 Q4 as the starting point, and HEY, what do you know?! WI ranks DEAD LAST in income growth among those 12 states!"" Others made similar claims, including a blogger on the liberal Daily Kos site. Are they right? Digging into the numbers We started with data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis, the same source Walker used. The data counts wages, property income and government assistance as ""personal income."" We crunched the numbers using that starting point at the end of 2010, the last quarter before Walker took over from Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. The end point was the first quarter 2014, the latest for which data was available. First, there is no ""Midwest"" category in the agency’s geographical breakdowns. Two of the regions the agency uses include states often associated as Midwestern peers for the Badger State. One is the ""Great Lakes"" region (Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio). The other is the ""Plains"" region: (Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota). Here's what we found: State Personal Income growth since 4th quarter 2010 Rank among 50 states North Dakota 32.81% 1 Iowa 15.70% 10 Nebraska 15.23% 11 South Dakota 13.53% 18 Ohio 13.42% 19 Kansas 12.61% 31 Indiana 12.48% 33 Minnesota 12.29% 34 Michigan 12.01% 37 Illinois 11.73% 39 Missouri 10.91% 43 Wisconsin 10.87% 44 By comparison, in Doyle’s last term, which coincided with the Great Recession, Wisconsin ranked 7th of the 12 states and ranked 26th nationally, one point above the U.S. average. When we asked the Bureau of Economic Analysis if the 2010 starting point makes sense for judging 2011 and forward, spokesman Thomas Dail said it was correct to use the fourth quarter of 2010 as the baseline. That allows a comparison of the pre-Walker income level to Walker’s first full year in office, 2011 and forward, he said. We asked three experts to examine the BEA figures. They were Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management; Laura Dresser, a labor economist and associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy; and Dale Knapp, research director at Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. All three cautioned that comparing quarters can lead to distortions -- and we noted that the last quarter before Walker saw an unusually large jump in personal income. That was due in part to an early shift in Medicaid payments to that quarter, the Walker campaign correctly points out. The statistical effect is a bigger starting point for Walker, meaning any gains on his watch look smaller than they would otherwise. Another defensible starting point is the first quarter of 2011, our experts said, which takes in Walker’s first three months. But that distorts in the other direction because the Medicaid payments -- having been shifted earlier -- look much lower. Using that baseline, Wisconsin’s growth was second-best in the Midwest. The Walker campaign doesn’t argue for using the 2011 base. They, and our experts, prefer to look at annual growth rates which smooth out the volatility you see in quarterly data. From 2010 to 2013, we found Wisconsin ranked 9th of the 12 Midwest states. To be sure, anomalies pop up in the numbers once in a while due to governmental policies. In his claim of ""We’re #1,"" Walker reached back one year from the latest quarter to a quarter that saw the biggest single-quarter loss in personal income in three years. That of course made the state look better in the comparison he chose. The loss was partly due to Washington’s ""fiscal-cliff legislation,"" which served to artificially boost incomes in late 2012, thereby depressing personal income in the quarter that was Walker’s one-year base. And partisans pick the presentation that best makes their case -- in this case, both Walker and his critics chose to compare quarterly figures rather than annual rates. Walker could have chosen an annual comparison -- 2012 to 2013, which is the most recent for which a full calendar year is available. But by that measure Wisconsin is middle of the pack on growth. There’s no one right way, our experts said. ""I think it is perfectly honest and accurate to say income grew 10.9 percent from the fourth quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2014,"" Jacobsen said, referring to the comparison that shows Wisconsin last in the Midwest. Our rating After Walker correctly pointed out that personal income growth is the best in the Midwest for the last year, commentators alleged that Wisconsin is ""dead last in income growth"" during Gov. Scott Walker’s three-plus years in office. The quarterly figures do put Wisconsin at the bottom, based on the starting point endorsed by the agency that compiled the information. Reader beware: Any such quarterly comparison has its flaws, as we’ve seen in these related claims. But by the numbers, the blogosphere’s claim is on target. We rate it True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096EB2480>],/factchecks/2014/aug/28/blog-posting/bloggers-say-wisconsin-ranks-last-income-growth-/

Clay Pell says his campaign has created more R.I. jobs than the revival of Narragansett Beer
","Clay Pell lobbed a zinger at rival Gina Raimondo during Tuesday night’s feisty Providence Journal-WPRI-12 Democratic gubernatorial debate. Pell took aim at Raimondo’s recent TV campaign ad,  during which she said she helped bring iconic Narragansett Beer (""Hi Neighbor! - Have a ‘Gansett"") back to Rhode Island. ""Now it’s a top-selling beer again,"" Raimondo said in the ad, as she reiterated her claim that she has helped create more than 1,000 jobs when she was a partner in her former company, Point Judith Capital. ""My campaign alone has created more jobs in the state of Rhode Island than Narragansett Beer,"" Pell said Tuesday, drawing applause and laughter from the live TV audience at the Providence Performing Arts Center. PolitiFact Rhode Island recently examined Raimondo’s ""more than 1,000 jobs"" claim and ruled it True -- within its narrow scope. Raimondo did not claim that she created those jobs in Rhode Island -- though many people have taken away that impression. So do more people work in Pell’s campaign than at Narragansett Beer? First, we checked with Pell’s campaign manager, Devin Driscoll. Driscoll said the campaign has 40 paid employees. Driscoll listed those jobs in an email: ""Team Pell has a field staff of thirty: three deputy field organizers (DFOs); twenty-three field organizers (FOs); two regional field directors (RFD); a deputy field director (DFD) and a field director."" Driscoll said the field organizers are paid an entry-level salary equivalent to $36,000 a year. He declined to enumerate other salaries. ""We also have a headquarters staff of ten: a driver, training director, policy director, digital director, GOTV director, Women for Pell director, operations director, scheduling director, deputy campaign manager and campaign manager."" ""All 40 of these folks are full-time and salaried, with the exception of three DFOs, who are stipended. Our FOs make a very competitive salary for organizers -- $36,000 a year, plus benefits (we offer healthcare through HealthSource RI to all salaried employees)."" Driscoll said he started on January 1, and ""we started onboarding field staff in May."" The last workers joined the campaign in June. The campaign also has a Rhode Island-based finance director, Driscoll said, who is a consultant. Three people have left in the past two weeks to go to college or graduate school: a driver, a press assistant, and our data director, Driscoll said. To be fair, these jobs are not permanent. Should Pell become the next governor, it is fair to say that the entire campaign staff won’t join him at the State House. Should Pell lose the election, Team Pell would be disbanded. Then, we checked with Mark Hellendrung, president of Narragansett Beer, which was brewed in Rhode Island from 1890 through 1983. Hellendrung said that, in addition to himself, there are six Rhode Island residents and two Massachusetts residents working full-time for the company in Rhode Island, for a total of nine. Four people work full-time out of state in sales and marketing. He said there are about 50 part-time employees who work at promotions events all over the East Coast; 20 of them live and work in Rhode Island. The company is headquartered  in Providence, but Hellendrung said the beer is now brewed in Rochester, N.Y., Pawcatuck, Conn., and Westport, Mass. Test batches have been brewed locally in Rhode Island; ultimately, the company hopes to open a brewery here. Our ruling Clay Pell says that his campaign has created ""more jobs in the state of Rhode Island than Narragansett Beer,"" a poke at Gina Raimondo’s claim that she helped bring Narragansett Beer back to Rhode Island. The Pell campaign provided a list of 40 campaign jobs; Narragansett Beer said it has 9 full-time employees in Rhode Island; 20 part-time people who work promotional events in Rhode Island; and four full-time employees out of state. A major difference is that the Pell jobs are short-term and, one way or the other, most or all will be gone no later than November. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we hoist a pint to Pell and rate it Mostly True.

John McCain says he holds the record for 'Meet the Press' appearances
","Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has a few pointers for Chuck Todd, who takes the helm of NBC’s Meet the Press on Sept. 7. On Aug. 27, McCain appeared on MSNBC’s the Daily Rundown as part of Todd’s weeklong send-off. ""I called to congratulate you and as the person who has the most appearances on Meet the Press, I’d be glad to give you a lot of advice and counseling, including the best gotcha questions of the week,"" McCain said. ""And I have one other suggestion, we should change the name from Meet the Press to Meet the World’s Foremost Political Junkie, And Guests. How ‘bout that?"" ""69 times,"" Todd quantified. He then rolled a montage of McCain on the show, including a 2008 interview with Tim Russert, who said that Republican Bob Dole had clocked the most appearances but ""there’s still time for (McCain) to catch up."" We wondered, has McCain caught up, meeting the press more times than any other guest? We’ve met before We reached out to McCain’s office and a spokesperson told us they don’t keep track of those numbers but said McCain surpassed Dole in 2012. Meet the Press’ fact page, which needs an update, still lists Dole as the most frequent guest, with 63 appearances. McCain is next with 53 appearances, and Vice President Joe Biden trails McCain by 10 appearances. McCain’s 54th appearance came on March 29, 2009, according to recently ousted host David Gregory. Dole still had the record among guests, but Gregory had encouraging words for McCain. ""We've been doing the calculations here. We think we can make this up, maybe within a year's time,"" he said. Three years later, McCain broke Dole’s record on March 18, 2012, his 64th appearance. ""You've been on this show more than I have,"" Gregory joked. Based on Meet the Press transcripts, McCain appeared on the show twice more in 2012. He hasn’t made an appearance this year, but went on three times in 2013, which brings his grand total to 69, according to our count. For the record, McCain has appeared on the Sunday shows 11 times so far in 2014, but not on Meet the Press. It's worth noting that NBC and McCain are using a slightly non-traditional definition of guest. Namely, it excludes journalists who appear on the show to debate the week's big stories. Again, according to NBC's out-dated fact page, the Washington Post’s David Broder clocked 401 Meet appearances, while Chicago Sun Times’  Robert Novak appeared on the show 248 times. Novak and Broder are both deceased. Our ruling McCain said that he’s ""the person who has the most appearances on Meet the Press."" Technically, multiple people who represent the press side of the meet have McCain beat. Of officeholders, we count McCain as the current leader -- with 69 appearances.

Did Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad charter a jet to send 124 immigrant children back to Honduras?
","The surge in unaccompanied minors coming from Central America to the U.S. border with Mexico may have moved off the front pages in recent weeks, but it’s still a hot topic on the Internet. A reader recently sent us a chain email that lauds Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican, for purportedly standing up to President Barack Obama’s decision to send more than 100 unaccompanied minors to Iowa. According to the email, Branstad quickly chartered a jet for the immigrant children and flew them all back to Honduras. Spoiler alert: This adventure story is pure fiction. Here’s the text of the email our reader received, complete with a misspelling of the governor’s name: ""Subject: Obama Flies Illegal Teens to Iowa -- Iowa Governor Flies Them Home ""Did you know this? ""Obama just said ‘Up yours Iowa’ and Iowa shoved it back. Governor of Iowa -- Hurray for you, Governor, who announced: Iowa will not take any illegals kids (most teenagers) in IOWA.   ""Yesterday Obama overruled him and sent him 124 young kids 13-19, landed the plane in Des Moines. Airport manager called the office of Governor Terry Bransted, who drove to the airport and chartered from Chicago a plane from United. Within 8 hours all the kids were loaded on, got food and drink. The plane left Iowa 8 o'clock Des Moines. Next stop was Honduras. Plane got unloaded, 4 social workers from Iowa made sure they got to the terminal, told the Honduras officials, here are your kids, they have no papers, you let them come illegal to America. Iowa refuses to take them. Iowa has their own laws. No minors who are not with adults. Iowa has not heard one thing from Washington. American states are fed up.  ""The Governor is a Republican. Kind of makes me wonder if he would like to become a candidate for President in the next election. ""Yea for the HAWKEYE State!  It is what all states should do in my opinion. ""Let’s hear it for Iowa!!!"" We asked the governor’s office about the email. ""It’s a rumor we have heard about for several weeks now, but it did not happen,"" said Jimmy Centers, Branstad’s communications director. Moreover, a governor like Branstad wouldn’t have the power to quickly deport dozens of children back to Honduras -- that’s a process governed by federal, not state, law. ""Airport travel, as interstate commerce, is governed by federal law and Congress,"" said Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California-Davis law school and a specialist in immigration law. ""State infringement on interstate commerce has repeatedly been struck down by the Supreme Court. State laws taxing entrants into the state have been struck down for about the last century. The Iowa scenario could never happen lawfully."" Under an anti-human-trafficking law signed by President George W. Bush in 2008, unaccompanied minors from noncontiguous countries (such as Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, the Central American countries fueling the current surge) are guaranteed access to the federal legal system to argue their case for remaining in the United States, rather than being deported outright, as unaccompanied minors from Mexico may be. In the wake of the surge of immigrant children, some lawmakers have called for revising or repealing the provision, but no such action has been taken yet. The Des Moines Register reported that at least 139 unaccompanied immigrant children had entered the state between Jan. 1, 2014, and July 18, 2014. They arrived in a trickle, not in a large group like the one described in the email. They came to the state because relatives who lived in Iowa were able to take them in. The children were told to live with their relatives until an immigration judge can hear their case. A judicial decision on whether they are granted asylum or face deportation can take years, given current dockets and staffing. In mid July -- before the email began circulating -- Branstad offered a mixed reaction to the possibility that some unaccompanied immigrant minors would end up in Iowa. ""The first thing we need to do is secure the border. I do have empathy for these kids,"" Branstad said, according to CBS News. ""But I also don’t want to send the signal that (you) send your kids to America illegally. That’s not the right message."" Our ruling The chain email said that Branstad chartered a plane to remove 124 young illegal immigrants from his state and take them back to Honduras. Branstad’s office denies this, and there is no credible evidence to undercut the governor’s account. In addition, Branstad would have no authority to make such a move on his own.

Shawn Lindsay says John Kitzhaber’s budget proposal is up 8 percent over last biennium’s funding level
","
Gov. John Kitzhaber’s budget has been fairly well received by Republicans. The key to his budgeting success has a lot to do with the fact that he has set levels according to what the state is projected to take in, not what departments say they need to keep providing current services.

Still, it’s quickly becoming a Republican talking point that the budget Kitzhaber proposed represents an increase over our current two-year budget. It has popped up in a note from Rep. Gene Whisnant, R-Sunriver, to his constituents; a newsletter from Rep. Kevin Cameron, R-Salem; and in an e-mail from Rep. Shawn Lindsay, R-Hillsboro.

For the purposes of this fact check, we’ll focus on Lindsay, who, based on the e-mails we’ve seen, takes the most aggressive approach.

In an e-mail to constituents, he writes:  ""Under the Governor's proposed budget, the state would have $1.2 BILLION more to spend in 2011-12 than it had in 2009-2010.  That's an INCREASE not a BUDGET CUT.  If I only got an 8% pay raise when I wanted a 30% pay raise, there's no way I'd call it a pay cut.""

We wouldn’t call that a pay cut either, so we decided to look into this one.

(For those interested, in the full statement, Lindsay also says the following: ""Increases in DHS (Department of Human Services) and OHA (Oregon Health Authority) spending is out-pacing increases in Education.  In other words, DHS and OHA spending increases are done at the expense of Education."" We already fact-checked a similar allegation and found it to be Barely True.)

Kitzhaber has proposed a combined general and lottery fund budget for the 2011-2013 biennium of $14.5 billion. There’s an extra $220 million that Kitzhaber has not allocated; he’s saving that as a cushion of sorts. That puts the budget at about $14.7 billion in all. Kitzhaber based that total on the most recent state revenue forecast.

Now, for comparison, the current two-year budget clocked in at $13.5 billion.

When you take these two numbers -- $14.7 billion and $13.5 billion -- side by side, it does indeed look like an increase of some $1.2 billion, or 8 percent. Hey! That’s what Lindsay said. So he’s right, right?

Not so fast.

That $13.5 billion total for the current biennium isn’t really the full extent of what the state spent. Remember that stimulus the federal government passed two years ago? Well that and a few other smaller bills infused the state’s budget with some $1.3 billion in one-time cash. Generally, you wouldn’t count that as part of the general and lottery fund budget, as those dollars went to very specific places in the total funds budget. That said, those dollars helped loosen up other dollars to go toward services that receive their money from the general fund.

All of that is a complicated way of saying that the state has been working with a $14.8 billion two-year budget. Bottom line: Kitzhaber’s spending proposal is on par with the current biennium.

We called Lindsay to see what he had to say about this. He argued that his e-mail was talking about the general and lottery funds only -- not the total fund budget. But he doesn’t make that clear in the e-mail. And even so, that seems to us to be a little deceiving.

Let’s look at this another way. Say last year you made $30,000 for the year and got an end-of-year bonus of $5,000. This year, however, your boss has said no bonuses, but your annual salary got bumped up to $35,000. By Lindsay’s standards, that’s a raise because he’s not counting the  bonus -- or, in the state’s case, the federal stimulus money. Fact is, though, you’d probably fold that bonus into your budget just as you would the extra cash in your paycheck. Well, without the bonus the following year, that extra $5,000 in wages wouldn’t feel much like a raise, would it? Not as far as we’re concerned.

And yet that’s what Lindsay and his fellow Republicans seem to be arguing here. Sorry, we just don’t see it.

We rate this claim Barely True.

Chain e-mail says welfare programs caused more long-term damage to Detroit than the atomic bomb caused to Hiroshima
","
You wouldn’t think there would be much connection between Detroit, a troubled rust belt city, and the bustling port city of Hiroshima, Japan. But trust us, countless bloggers see a link.

Do a Google search of the phrase ""Hiroshima and Detroit"" and you’ll see hundreds of links to blogs, all displaying variations of a claim that’s been widely circulated by chain e-mailers for the last few years.  

The e-mails open with black and white photographs of an atomic bomb mushroom cloud and the ruins of Hiroshima that followed the U.S. attack on Aug. 6, 1945. As you scroll down, you see bright color photos of a skyline, with high-rise buildings and busy highways -- the modern Hiroshima.

Then comes a series of grim photos of Detroit, showing abandoned and collapsing apartment buildings and houses.  

The e-mails include text that varies from version to version but conveys the same message: that welfare is the reason for Detroit’s problems.

The email that reached our in-box ended with a question and a statement:  ""What has caused more long-term destruction -- the A-Bomb or U.S. Government (Democrat) welfare programs created to buy the votes of those who want someone to care for them? Japan does not have a welfare system. Work or do without.""

We wondered whether it was worth our time to fact-check something so seemingly preposterous. But when we realized how widely this e-mail is circulating and how much it seems to be accepted as fact, we decided to forge ahead.

Clearly, Detroit is in trouble. When Mayor David Bing gave his first state-of-the-city address last year, he noted the city was nearly bankrupt and facing a $325-million deficit. Unemployment was approaching 30 percent, he said, and 50,000 homeowners faced foreclosure.

But did welfare cause Detroit’s problems? We put that question to Margaret Dewar, a professor of architecture and urban planning at the University of Michigan.

""That is ridiculous,"" Dewar said, adding that she has never heard anyone suggest welfare was a contributing factor. Since 1950, Detroit has lost more than 80 percent of its jobs, Dewar said, because manufacturers embraced new technologies and moved their businesses to the suburbs.

That destroyed retail  businesses and led to a drastic drop in the city’s population; from the 1950 peak of 1.85 million, the population had fallen to about 900,000 by 2009.

Dewar’s conclusions were seconded by Thomas J. Sugrue, a professor of history and sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, who wrote a prize-winning book called ""The Origin of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit.""

Asked whether welfare played a role in the city’s troubles, Sugrue had a one-word answer: ""No.""

Detroit’s decline began shortly after World War II, he said, for the same reasons Dewar cited.
If welfare were the problem, Sugrue said, then one could expect to see hollowed out sections of  Stockholm  or Paris, cities in nations with generous welfare programs.

Then, we examined the other half of the chain-email claim: that Japan has no welfare programs.
Timothy S. George, a history professor at the University of Rhode Island who specializes in postwar Japan, said Japan actually has an extensive social welfare system -- though not as generous as programs in many European countries.

Nicole Freiner, an assistant professor of political science at Bryant University who focuses on Asian politics, notes that the United States helped rebuild those cities with a portion of the Marshall Plan, which also helped rebuild Europe.

Japan, she said, offers such social welfare programs as social security, pensions, national health care and coverage for unemployment and occupational injuries, and benefits for small children and the elderly. It also provides what many in the United States would define as welfare -- financial assistance to those in need.

She referred us to an academic paper that finds Japan spending almost 16 percent of its Gross Domestic Product on social welfare programs.  That’s less than the 21 percent the United States spends. But it’s not zero.

George’s response to the e-mail:  ""Disgusting. A ridiculous comparison that’s really in bad taste. In fact, it’s outrageous.""

We agree. 
The Hiroshima-Detroit email utilizes a gallery of dramatic photos that attempt to distort history -- in two countries. The conclusion is ridiculous, the definition of Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D8E380>],/factchecks/2011/feb/18/chain-email/chain-e-mail-says-welfare-programs-caused-more-lon/

Senator makes point about Rick Scott’s authority to nix rail deal, but Scott still holds most cards
","
When Florida Gov. Rick Scott announced he had decided to kill a high-speed rail line connecting Tampa and Orlando, legislators, local officials, union groups and others grumbled about Scott's timing and reasoning.

Then many of them thought: Wait, can he even do that?

After all, the Legislature created the Florida Rail Enterprise in 2009 to manage the construction of a high-speed line, and then budgeted $300 million in state funds to help build the project. The rest of the money -- $2.4 billion -- was coming from Washington.

Following Scott's announcement on Feb. 16, 2011, Senate Budget Committee Chairman J.D. Alexander suggested Scott overstepped his authority in declaring the rail project dead.

""The Constitution,"" he said, ""doesn't allow the governor to not-spend appropriations funds."" And there is $300 million appropriated for the rail line between Orlando and Tampa, Alexander said.

Is Scott overstepping his Constitutional powers? Can the rail project be saved by state lawmakers?

The fact that Scott said he would reject federal high-speed rail wasn't itself shocking. The new governor has long been critical of President Barack Obama's spending policies and approach to government.

But the timing of Scott's announcement -- at a hastily arranged morning press conference -- sent lawmakers in Washington and Tallahassee scrambling. In Washington, U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson and members of Florida's Congressional delegation pivoted to see if another agency could receive the federal money instead and manage the rail project. U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood on Thursday gave Florida lawmakers one week to see if they could work out a deal, but said that Scott would have to sign off on any agreement.

In Tallahassee, lawmakers similarly were scratching their heads and wondering what's next.

A veto-proof majority of the Florida Senate wrote LaHood asking for time to seek an alternative to keep the 84-mile-long rail project alive while suggesting that the state's Florida Rail Enterprise could manage the project without Scott's approval. State Sen. David Simmons, R-Altamonte Springs, suggested another option -- though in its infancy -- would be to create a public corporation that could insulate the state from potential cost overruns to build the train, or operational losses once the train is running.

""We want to try to keep this alive,"" Simmons said.

Scott vs. the Legislature

As Simmons, Nelson and others work on one hand to circumvent Scott, they also continue to poke at the governor by saying he can't just do this unilaterally.

The current state budget includes $131 million in high-speed rail development (line item 2094). That's part of the $300-million-or-so the state has pledged as part of the overall $2.7 billion rail project.

Alexander's contention is that, without the approval of the Legislature, Scott must spend that money on high-speed rail.

He has a point.

State statutes prohibit the governor from ""impounding"" state funds -- meaning the governor cannot simply choose to not spend money budgeted. The governor has to veto a spending proposal, or accept it. And if he accepts it, he must spend the money for that purpose. The wrinkle in this case, of course, is that Gov. Charlie Crist signed the current budget, not Scott. But the budget is a law, which Scott is obligated to follow.

Alexander made the same contention when it came to Scott's decision to sell the state two airplanes, saying the sale may have violated the law. The current state budget includes funds to maintain and operate the planes, and Scott just can't ignore the line item in the budget. Scott said the decision was completely legal.

A second point: While most of the federal money for the rail project has not yet been awarded, some has.

The state received $66.66 million in a federal grant in May 2010 to begin implementing plans for the high-speed line. Officials say about $26 million of that money already has been spent.

""The bottom line is that he can't reject this money: It was already approved by another Legislature and another governor,"" Simmons said. ""It's like trying to veto a bill after it becomes law. It's too late."" 
Scott still holds most cards

The money in play -- the $300 million in state funding and the smaller federal portion -- is peanuts when considering the entire $2.7 billion project.

And that is where Scott has the upper hand, lawmakers, former state officials and transportation experts told us.

He can veto future appropriations in the state budget, whether the source of the funds is state money or federal. If somehow, those vetoes are overridden, Scott can wreak havoc on rail plans in other ways. 
If a bond issue is required, he could try to kill the project through a vote on the Cabinet, or he could to hold up giving away the right-of-way to build the rail line. Or he could order his Department of Transportation secretary to fire people associated with the rail project. 
""He has the ability to direct agency heads and the ability to control expenditures that come into the budget over the next few years through a veto,"" said former state Sen. Dan Gelber, who was the Democratic candidate for attorney general. ""If the governor's dead set on making it not happen, he can make it not happen.""

Even Alexander said the idea of rail is likely dead in Florida as long as Scott opposes it.

""It may be a moot point when he's clearly trying to pull the plug,"" said Doug Callaway, president of Floridians for Better Transportation, a statewide transportation lobbying group. 
Though we think Alexander should have cited state statutes and not the Constitution, he is technically right that Scott is required to spend money in the state budget the way it is appropriated. That means the Legislature could play a game of chicken, forcing Scott to spend the $131 million in the 2010-11 budget, and maybe the remaining $170 or so million of state funds, and maybe even the $66.66 million in federal money.

But getting him to spend the necessary money beyond that, all the federal and state money actually needed to complete the rail program, is a much taller order. And when it comes to the outcome of rail in Florida -- at least when it comes to the Florida Legislature -- that is today a much more important point. That's the context that gives Scott the upper hand.

Rand Paul says zeroing out non-military discretionary spending can't balance the budget alone
","
During a Feb. 14, 2011, interview with Fox Business News, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., told anchor Andrew Napolitano that balancing the budget cannot be done without touching sacrosanct areas such as the military.

""The problem is that things are out of control, and unless you accept that you can have federal government doing less things, like unless you accept the philosophic principle that education should be handled by the states and localities, they don't know where to cut,"" Paul said. ""Or unless you accept the principle that military spending will have to be cut. They don't have enough money to cut. They can cut all of the non-military discretionary spending and not balance the budget.""

He is making a dramatic point that even if Congress were to eliminate every non-military program except for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid (which are considered mandatory rather than discretionary), it still wouldn’t be enough to balance the budget.

We should emphasize the sweeping nature of ""discretionary"" spending -- that is, spending that has to be funded by Congress every year. It includes all defense and homeland security spending plus virtually every major government program other than Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. It includes everything from the National Institutes of Health to the air traffic control system to Pell Grants for college students. For this year, it includes $507 billion for non-security and $908 billion for security spending.
 
There are two other main elements of the federal budget: mandatory programs and interest on the debt. Mandatory programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are funded by formulas that cannot be pared back without specific action by Congress to rewrite those formulas. Interest payments are also considered mandatory.

We reviewed the latest budget figures and found that Paul is correct. If you subtract out every last penny of non-security discretionary spending and simply add together security spending, mandatory programs and interest, the government is still projected to face expenditures of $3.309 trillion for fiscal year 2011. That’s a full $1.14 trillion more than the $2.17 trillion in taxes and other income the government is expecting to collect for 2011.

So the government would have a trillion-dollar-plus deficit in 2011 even without spending anything on non-security discretionary spending.

Now, Paul did say ""non-military"" rather than ""non-security,"" which is a slightly different measurement, since the Department of Homeland Security and a few other security-related programs outside the Defense Department are categorized under the ""security"" heading. But the dollar amounts involved are not enough to make a difference in evaluating his statement. So we rate Paul’s statement True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096730B00>],/factchecks/2011/feb/17/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-zeroing-out-non-military-discretion/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'Mitch Daniels']","
Mitch Daniels says interest on debt will soon exceed security spending
","
Budget season in Washington often brings out colorful comparisons designed to highlight economic folly. Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana offered one in his speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 11, 2011. 
Speaking at the CPAC Ronald Reagan Centennial Dinner, Daniels likened the mounting national debt to a foreign invader -- a ""new Red Menace, this time consisting of ink."" The possible presidential candidate then declared that servicing that debt will soon cost more than national security: 
""We are currently borrowing the entire defense budget from foreign investors,"" Daniels told conservative conference-goers. ""Within a few years, we will be spending more on interest payments than on national security. That is not, as our military friends say, a ‘robust strategy.’"" 
We decided to do the math on that striking comparison for ourselves. As is often the case, different definitions can change the budget picture dramatically -- though not enough to make Daniels’ claim hold up. 
The White House’s newly released budget seemed like a good place to start. Handily, it divides discretionary spending into security-related outlays (including Defense, Homeland Security and ongoing wars) and everything else. 
Projected security spending rises from $815 billion in 2010 to $914 billion in 2021. (It dips slightly along the way, reflecting savings from planned troop reductions in Iraq and Afghanistan.) 
Meanwhile the budget has net interest payments rising fourfold, from $196 billion last year to a stunning $844 billion by 2021. As two budget analysts we interviewed confirmed, interest payments will grow explosively over the next decade but do not exceed security spending in any given year -- much less ""in a few years."" 
Of course White House budget proposals are just that, proposals, so we ran the comparison again using the Congressional Budget Office’s latest baseline forecasts. 
Daniels did a little better here, because the CBO’s measure of discretionary ""defense"" spending excludes Homeland Security and several other budget lines. Still, defense spending topped interest payments through 2021. 
Is there any way to make Daniels’ math add up? If you limit ""national security"" spending to the Department of Defense budget -- an extremely narrow definition -- then interest payments pull ahead in 2017 (or perhaps in 2016, since outlays usually fall short of budget authority). 
Another possibility would be to apply a worst-case scenario to the U.S. debt forecast, explained Josh Gordon, policy director with the Concord Coalition, a group that urges deficit reduction. If federal spending isn’t restrained at all, and if Bush-era tax cuts become permanent, by 2021 interest payments might sneak past national defense. 
""But that’s an odd position for a Republican presidential candidate to take,"" Gordon said. In a follow-up e-mail he explained that ""for Daniels to assume discretionary spending rises at 3 percent a year over ten years means he is assuming Republicans will have no effect on the levels of government spending over the next ten years, or even that they will encourage Obama to spend more than he is proposing to spend in his budget."" 
When we asked Gov. Daniels’ office to explain his reasoning, a spokesperson pointed out that the current defense budget ""is close to $700 billion,"" and that by the end of the decade, under White House estimates, ""we will be paying $700 billion a year"" to service the national debt. She directed us to a Nov. 24, 2009, piece in the Washington Examiner making a similar point. 
But that’s hardly ""in a few years"" -- and more important, it compares apples today to oranges a decade from now. This mathematical sleight-of-hand was not disclosed in Daniels' speech. 
So he is incorrect that ""within a few years, we will be spending more on interest payments than on national security.""  It is true that interest on the national debt will grow faster than any other category of federal spending, even Medicare. But the comparison Daniels drew to illustrate that falls short under any reasonable definition of ""national security"" spending.

Talk show host Ed Schultz says Wisconsin state employees might lose 20 percent of their income under Gov. Scott Walker’s budget repair plan
","When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker proposed making state employees pay more for health and pension benefits, one of his aides said the changes would cost the average worker roughly 8 percent of his or her salary.

Walker’s move so angered MSNBC-TV talk show host Ed Schultz that he came to Madison on Feb. 17, 2011 -- the day the Legislature was scheduled to vote on the proposals -- to air his show.

Two days earlier, Schultz claimed on ""The Ed Show"" the impact on state workers would be much greater than 8 percent. He said:

""People who earn $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year might have 20 percent of their income just disappear overnight.""

Schultz hedged a bit by saying might. But the implication was the effect of Walker’s proposals would be to cut the income of large numbers of state workers by 20 percent.

Let’s see if he’s right.

Schultz said in the broadcast that he had been given figures that show a 20 percent impact. We asked his staff for that information and they said they would attempt to provide it.  But as of publication, we have not heard from them.

Under the Republican governor’s plan, state employees would contribute 5.8 percent of their pay toward pensions and pay at least 12 percent of their health insurance premiums.

Meanwhile, we consulted other sources on how much more state workers would pay if the budget repair bill is adopted.

It’s a political debate, but this is largely a mathematical question.

Here’s what our sources said: Under the plan, all employees would pay the same percentage of their income toward pensions.

But the larger health insurance payments would eat up a higher percentage of the income of low-income employees than of high-income employees.

So the total impact would vary on a percentage basis.

That said, the total impact, in terms of a percentage of income, would not vary widely, according to Wineke. The vast majority of state employees take the same so-called Tier 1 health coverage, he said.

Let’s return to the statement:

Schultz said Wisconsin state employees earning $30,000 to $50,000 per year ""might have 20 percent of their income just disappear overnight"" as a result of Walker’s proposals to boost state employee payments for health and pension benefits. It was a broad statement about the impact of the measures.  

The sources we consulted indicate the range is 6.8 percent to 11 percent. Even if the higher payments comprise 20 percent of the income of some employees, there’s no indication it will be that high on a wide scale, particularly for state workers earning as much as $50,000 per year. If Schultz can provide evidence of a large-scale 20 percent impact, we’ll review this item.

But this is our rating: False. (Editor’s note: On March 4, 2011, this item was changed to fix an error in the percentage of employee salary that goes toward paying for pensions and health insurance for a hypothetical employee at UW-Eau Claire.)

Wisconsin state Sen. Alberta Darling says unions in the private sector bargain “for the most part” only on wages
","
A key argument for Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to strip Wisconsin public employees of most of their bargaining rights is pretty simple: The budget is tight, and they’ve got sweetheart deals you don’t find in the private sector.

If the move is approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature, the state employees would be forced to pay more for pension contributions and health care coverage. As it stands, Walker’s bill would essentially leave only wages to be discussed at the bargaining table -- and those raises would generally be limited by the rate of inflation.

As Republican leaders fanned out to defend the bill, state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills,  appeared on WISN-TV’s ""Upfront with Mike Gousha"" on  Feb. 13, 2011. She is co-chairman of the powerful Joint Finance Committee, the first stop for the bill.

She began her comments by agreeing with Gousha about the scope of the proposals, which have stirred massive protests at the Capitol -- ""It’s huge."" -- and went on to say it was important that public employees pay their ""fair share,"" just like workers in the private sector.

Darling added, ""The governor is proposing that we have collective bargaining deal only with wages which is how it is, for the most part, in the private sector.""

That didn’t sound right to us.

Walker’s bill would rewrite the state Employment Relations Act -- a law covering state employees that is more than 50 years old and was last amended in 1971. But private sector unions are covered by a federal law and generally bargain on all sorts of things.

We tried to reach Darling to ask for her backup, but she didn’t respond.

So we turned to some experts who are involved in private sector labor relations. And we took a look at federal law, the National Labor Relations Act,which governs most private employers.

According to this overview on the National Labor Relations Board website:

""Congress enacted the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in 1935 to protect the rights of employees and employers, to encourage collective bargaining, and to curtail certain private sector labor and management practices, which can harm the general welfare of workers, businesses and the U.S. economy.""

The law gives workers the right to bargain collectively for a contract that sets wages, benefits, hours and other working conditions, the NLRA says.

The law also requires workers and employers to ""bargain in good faith about wages, hours, vacation time, insurance, safety practices and other mandatory subjects.""

That covers a lot more than wages.

To see how it plays out on a practical level, we checked in with some folks on both sides of the bargaining table.

Candice Owley, president Wisconsin Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals, said wages are only part of what’s important to nurses when they negotiate with hospitals. Her union represents about 3,000 nurses, about half of whom are employed at private facilities.

""We spend very little time these days on wages and a whole lot of time on working conditions,"" she said, such as seniority, schedules, the length of shifts, and what happens when a nurse is assigned to a different department.

Said Owley: ""We bargain every kind of working condition imaginable.""

James R. Scott, a Milwaukee laywer who represents management. His firm, Linder & Marsack, has about 80 percent private sector work.

""That’s not true,"" he said of Darling’s statement. ""The standard is that you can bargain about everything that affects wages, hours and working conditions.""

Scott noted that recent high profile negotiations have involved concessions from workers at companies such as Harley-Davidson, Kohler and Mercury Marine.

All of those manufacturers recently sought, and won, contracts that included two-tiered wage structures, the use of temporary workers and other changes that will reduce labor costs. With the companies reeling from the recession, the union members voted for changes that saved their jobs from being moved to other states.

""When you’re in concession bargaining it tends to be about money,"" Scott said, but added that unions ""are not prevented from making a non-economic proposal.""

Rick Badger, executive director of AFSCME District Council 40, whose membership is largely public employees, but includes some private sector workers.

In the cases of Harley and other manufacturers, ""really drastic measures were taken to some jobs, but the unions still exist,"" Badger said. He said future talks will, of course, include discussions of benefits, schedules and other matters.

""All of these things are negotiated,"" Badger said. ""You sit down and come up with solutions. It’s not just money, it’s the workplace.""

Let’s return to Darling’s statement.

In arguing public employee unions ought to be treated more like their their private sector counterparts, she said ""for the most part"" private contract talks are limited to wages.

However, the National Labor Relations Act make it clear: Private employers with unions are not only allowed to bargain on many other issues -- that law requires the subjects be about far more than just wages.

"['Labor', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'AFL-CIO']","
Wisconsin AFL-CIO says Gov. Scott Walker’s budget repair bill would take away all rights in the workplace for public employees
","
Labor experts agree that Gov. Scott Walker’s move to curtail collective bargaining rights for public employees is a dramatic departure from Wisconsin’s labor-friendly past.

The Wisconsin State AFL-CIO has launched TV and radio spots condemning the plan while the Wisconsin Club for Growth is airing a TV ad supporting the changes. We’ll look at the Club for Growth ad in a separate item.

The TV ad from the AFL-CIO centers on this message, delivered by a narrator:

""There’s now a move under way in Madison to take away the rights of thousands of teachers, nurses and other trusted public employees. A bill to take away any say they have in the workplace, and eliminate their union.""

The visual backdrop includes lines from news articles about Walker’s plan.

Among the snippets: A  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story that reads Walker’s plan would eliminate ""any say on benefits and work rules"" and an Associated Press story that reads ""all collective bargaining rights would be removed for state and local public employees.""

Is the ad correct that the plan would ""eliminate"" union representation for thousands and wipe out ""any say"" they have through collective bargaining.

When asked to back up the claims, AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Stephanie Bloomingdale cited a Wheeler Report analysis that summarizes the budget-repair bill.

Let’s take a deeper look at claim.

Most of the debate has focused on what bargaining rights will be curtailed and the overall effect of the plan.

Digging deeper, the bill does eliminate all bargaining rights -- wages, benefits, working conditions -- for specific categories of public employees.

It would roll back the rights to organize unions and bargain for benefits for 30,000 University of Wisconsin System faculty and academic staff. Those rights were approved by Democrats in the 2009-'11 budget.

Not all of the 30,000 have joined a union, though. So far, under those rights, faculty at two universities, UW-Superior and UW-Eau Claire, have formed unions.  

The measure would also repeal collective bargaining rights for some 5,000 home health care workers and for 2,800 employees of University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics, including nurses. It would also eliminate current collective bargaining rights of licensed child care providers.

All of that is also discussed in summaries of the bill and a letter from Walker to state employees.

As for the other public employees -- a much larger group that includes schoolteachers, local government workers and about half of 76,000 state employees -- the bill would allow collective bargaining only on a base pay rate (not overtime or special pay issues), and on raises only within the rate of inflation. That means no bargaining on fringe benefits, working conditions, outsourcing, safety and other issues.

So, the TV ad is correct on many of its main points.

But it also overreaches.

For instance, it suggests that the outright elimination of bargaining rights would cover all public employees. But they would not be completely eliminated for teachers outside of higher education, one group cited. Or for all ""other trusted public employees.""

Indeed, the ad does not mention that there would be no change for firefighters, police and state trooper unions -- a fact that has drawn its own criticism. (Firefighters are part of AFL-CIO; police are not.)

That incomplete information is underlined when the ad flashes a portion of a Feb. 10, 2011, Associated Press story, highlighting the words: ""All collective bargaining rights would be removed for state and local public employees.""

That’s a selectively edited version of the AP story, which added a significant phrase to that line: ""except when it comes to wages.""

The effect is to make Walker’s sweeping plan look even bolder.

Let’s look at the rest of the message as presented in the ad.

Would workers ""take away any say"" in the workplace, as the ad claims?

Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said public employees would continue to have a say on working conditions -- not through unions, but through civil service laws. He noted those laws contain ways to file workplace grievances, and ensure employees are hired based on merit and experience, and are fired only for just cause.

But civil service systems are not in place at all Wisconsin municipalities and leave a lot of workers uncovered, according to Andrew Phillips, general counsel for the Wisconsin Counties Association.

For instance, about one-third of counties have no civil service system, and of the two-thirds that do, many only apply to deputy sheriffs, he said. The Legislature was considering changes to address this.

What about the question of whether the unions would be eliminated?

Clearly, some workers would have the right to organize directly eliminated, while many others would not.

Bloomingdale, the AFL-CIO official, acknowledges that the bill before the Legislature does not directly eliminate all subjects of collective bargaining -- but nearly all of them. She argues the bill’s provisions overall discredit the unions’ role and therefore endanger them.

One example she cites: Raises for unionized workers would be capped at inflation, but pay for nonunion employees is not. That disparity would hurt union membership, Bloomingdale said.

Other aspects of the bill: As Walker noted in his letter, employers would be prohibited from collecting union dues on behalf of the unions, members of collective bargaining units will not be required to pay dues, and there would have to be a vote every year on the status of the union.

We asked experts including academics and lawyers on both sides of labor-management talks about the assertion that  -- on a practical basis -- the plan would mean the death of public employee unions.

James Scott, a management-side attorney who represents Milwaukee County, said the changes are dramatic, but not unprecedented. He said nine states totally prohibit collective bargaining for public employees, and 10 others restrict it to police/fire, or teachers or state employees.

His view of how life would be under the proposal:

""There isn’t much utility in belonging to a public sector labor union other than perhaps the social side of it,"" Scott said. He said calling it a death knell for unions might be ""a little bit"" too strong, but not much.

Timothy Hawks, whose law firm represents municipal and state employees, said if the bill goes through as drafted ""you have busted every (public employee) union in the state."" 
A state official with a stake in both sides of labor disputes, Peter Davis, general counsel at the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, said it was a ""fair prediction"" public sector workers would walk away from paying dues.

Cheryl Maranto, chairman of the management department at Marquette University’s College of Business Administration, said the bill would have the effect of ""totally eliminating public sector bargaining in the state"" by rendering the unions ""irrelevant and powerless."" In the historical view, she said Walker’s Democratic predecessor, Jim Doyle, overreached with pro-union moves and now Walker is going too far in the opposite direction.

Let’s get to the bottom line.

The AFL-CIO ad claims ""thousands"" of workers, including teachers, would lose all say in the workplace and see their union eliminated under Walker’s budget-repair bill.

The measure would eliminate bargaining rights for some groups of public employees, including nurses and teachers in higher education. That total tallies out to ""thousands,"" but the ad presents the question as if all public employees would lose all bargaining rights. It even selectively shortens a news account to underline this point. That is an overreach, at least as an immediate consequence of the bill. As for the future, three of our four experts agreed with the union contention that it could be the end result in the future. The fourth felt it was only a small stretch.

The PolitiFact definition for Half True is: The statement is accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That’s what this ad does.

And that’s the ruling: Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809721FD00>],/factchecks/2011/feb/17/afl-cio/wisconsin-afl-cio-says-gov-scott-walkers-budget-re/
"['State Budget', 'Florida', 'Joe Negron']","
State Sen. Joe Negron says human services spending has grown at twice the rate of other areas of the budget
","
The call for cuts to state spending has started in earnest in Tallahassee where lawmakers are beginning the process of formulating Florida's upcoming budget. They are doing so amid projections of a $3.62 billion financial shortfall.

One cost-cutting plan, pitched by Sen. Joe Negron, a Stuart Republican who chairs the Senate Health and Human Services Appropriations Committee, calls for trimming $1.5 billion in health care spending by privatizing Medicaid and cutting certain benefits.

""My goal is the benefits under Medicaid will not be worse than what any private citizen has, but not better, either,"" Negron told the Palm Beach Post on Feb. 14, 2011.

Negron also spoke about his plan to rein in health care spending at a Feb. 15 hearing of his committee.

""For the last decade, funding in the health and human services budget has grown at twice the rate as other parts of the budget, and I think that context is important,"" Negron told the committee, as reported by the Orlando Sentinel.

We decided to evaluate Negron's claim concerning the rate of growth for program spending.

When we asked the senator how he arrived at his statement, he provided us with this spreadsheet that gave the amount appropriated for human services for the 2001-2002 budget compared to the amount appropriated in the 2010-2011 budget. He also provided spending figures for all other program areas in those two years.

To clarify, health and human services is not a single department in Florida. Rather, it's a section of the budget that provides funding for state agencies like the Department of Health, Department of Children and Families, Elder Affairs, Veterans Affairs and the Agency for Health Care Administration.

Negron's figures show $16.9 billion was appropriated for spending in the 2001-02 budget, which 10 years later increased to $28.5 billion. That's an increase of 68 percent.

He did the same calculation for all other state-funded programs, showing a change from $31.2 billion in 2001-02 to $41.8 billion a decade later. Those figures amount to a 34 percent increase.

""The extraordinary growth in Medicaid has limited the ability to fund other equally worthy budget areas such as education,"" Negron said in a phone interview on Feb. 15.

By taking a financial snapshot of the budgets approved in 2001 and 2010, Negron's figures do demonstrate that the change in the human services budget is twice the change in the rest of the budget. But is it fair to compare just the first and last years of the decade, which shows the change but not the rate of growth? After all, parts of the budget went up and down at different times and different rates during those years.

The Governor's Office of Policy and Budget pointed us to 10 years of budgets. To evaluate the rate of growth, we computed the compound annual growth rates over the decade.

The compound annual growth rate is what financial analysts call a ""smoother."" It would be the growth rate if the budget grew at a steady rate for 10 years, and it's a common way to compare the rate of change over time.

We'd explain how to calculate it, but it involves exponents. This is a good explanation, if you want to see the details. A number of free CAGR calculators are available on the internet, and you can try them here, here or here. You can see our math here.

In a CAGR comparison, the rates are a little different. The budget for human services grew at a compound annual growth rate of 5.3 percent over 10 years, and the rest of the budget grew at 3.04 percent.

That's still considerably higher growth for human services, by about 75 percent, but not twice as much.

Negron was looking back at the past decade, but we also reviewed Gov. Rick Scott's proposed budget for the next two years. The budget cuts are about $5 billion the first year, 2011-12, and another $2.6 billion the following year. And Scott proposes to keep human services spending at almost the same level as this year. So if Negron had included the budget forecast in his statement, it would have easily been true no matter which method we used for comparison.

But Negron's comment was that ""for the last decade, funding in the health and human services budget has grown at twice the rate as other parts of the budget."" From the start of the decade to the end, the increase in the human services budget is double the rest of the budget, but the growth rate is not quite doubled. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B52600>],/factchecks/2011/feb/17/joe-negron/state-sen-joe-negron-says-human-services-spending/
"['Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Social Security', 'Virginia', 'Scott Rigell']","
Rep. Scott Rigell says the United States borrows more than 40 cents of every dollar it spends
","
Federal budget season officially opened on Feb. 14 with the release of President Obama’s spending proposal for the coming fiscal year.

Some of the first shots were fired by Virginia Republicans in the House of Representatives, charging Obama is not doing enough to cut spending and sink budget deficits.

""We are a nation $14 trillion in debt and are borrowing more than 40 cents of every dollar we spend,"" said Scott Rigell, who represents Virginia’s Second District, in a press release.

Rigell is not the only Republican using that line. We wanted to see if it is true.

Crystal Cameron, Rigell’s director of communications, told us the congressman based his statement on the Treasury Department’s monthly report on the government’s income and expenditures.

We turned to those summaries and did some math.

In fiscal 2010, which ended Sept. 30, 2010, the federal government had revenues of $2.16 trillion. It spent $3.46 trillion. That means the deficit was 37.5 percent of total spending.

The Treasury also has information through January of this fiscal year. The U.S. has spent $1.18 trillion while receiving $758.35 billion. That gives us a deficit worth 35.6 percent of spending. Uncle Sam projects the deficit will be of 36.9 percent spending for the entire 2011 fiscal year.

So the true figures are a bit below Rigell’s claim that we are covering 40 cents of every dollar spent with debt. But he’s pretty close to the right number.

There is, however, a catch. The Treasury Department divides its revenue and spending into two categories: on-budget and off-budget.

Matt Anderson, a Treasury spokesman, said off-budget contains Social Security and the Postal Service. The services are not included in budget bills approved because they are expected to be self-supporting, although in recent years Congress has spent money to cover losses at the Postal Service. All other revenues and spending are considered on-budget.

A chunk of our payroll taxes go directly into Social Security funds, which are then disbursed to recipients. The money never goes into the larger pool of U.S. revenue, nor do receipts from income taxes, corporate taxes or other forms of federal revenue go towards Social Security payments.

The off-budget programs run a surplus. During the 2010 fiscal year they had revenue of $631.69 billion against spending of $554.69 billion. That means the deficit for on-budget programs was 47.3 percent. The full-year estimate for the 2011 fiscal year would put the deficit in on-budget programs at 45.9 percent.

We asked Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow and budget expert at the center-to-left Brookings Institution, to check our figures. She and her research assistant,  Alex Gold, confirmed our math. They said ""the exact numbers depend on the time period examined, but 40 percent seems to be a reasonable ballpark figure.""

To get historic perspective, we looked at U.S. budgets from 1930 until 2010. The highest deficits, as a percentage of spending, came in 1943 during World War II, when 69.5 percent of spending was debt financed.

In 1985, during when Ronald Reagan was president, the gap was 22.4 percent, and the deficit gap never fell below 11 percent under his watch.  In 1995, during the Clinton Administration, the gap was 10.8 percent. The budget would actually enjoy four years of surplus at the end of his tenure, reaching a high point with revenues exceeding spending by 13.2 percent in 2000.

In 2005 under George W. Bush, deficit spending accounted for 12.9 percent of outlays. The 2009 budget, passed during Bush’s final months in office and altered when Obama took over, saw spending exceed revenues by 40.2 percent.

To review, Rigell said the United States is ""borrowing more than 40 cents of every dollar we spend."" Under the total budget figures the deficit is actually a bit smaller than that mark, coming in at 37.5 percent in the last fiscal year and a slightly lower number so far this year.

But when Social Security and Postal Service funds are excluded, as they are from the annual federal budget, the size of the deficit climbs above 40 percent.

By one measure, Rigell slightly over-estimates the percentage of our annual spending that is deficit-based. By another, he slightly under-estimates it. Overall, he’s made an accurate claim. We rate his statement True.   ",[<zip object at 0x000002809788DE80>],/factchecks/2011/feb/17/scott-rigell/rep-scott-rigell-says-united-states-borrows-more-4/
"['Education', 'Florida', 'Michelle Rhee']","
Michelle Rhee tells Florida legislators spending on education is way up, but the results are worse
","
Florida legislators last week fawned over former Washington, D.C., public schools chancellor Michelle Rhee as she addressed House and Senate members. Today, PolitiFact Florida offers its most sincere form of admiration:

We put Rhee in front of the Truth-O-Meter.

Rhee -- who was recently featured on Oprah, appeared on the cover of Newsweek and in the documentary film Waiting for Superman -- came to Tallahassee Feb. 8-9, 2011, to help craft Florida education policy. The Legislature and Gov. Rick Scott want to revive proposals to end tenure for teachers and tie teacher pay to student performance, both measures Rhee supports.

During her remarks, Rhee also at least tacitly defended Scott's proposals to cut public education funding as part of his budget proposals for 2011-12 and 2012-13.

""Money does not necessarily correlate with student achievement,"" Rhee said. ""In this country in the last 30 years, we have more than doubled the amount of money we are spending per child…and the results have gotten worse, not better.""

Rhee says education spending and student results are moving opposite directions. Is she right?

Per-pupil spending

Let's first look at U.S. education spending.

Education spending statistics are tracked by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics. The center has collected and analyzed per-pupil spending since 1919, tracking both the actual per-pupil investment as well as normalizing the expenditures based on the rate of inflation. That allows folks like Rhee, and us, to use the research as a method of comparison.

The most recent calculations are from 2006-2007 and show that the expenditure per pupil enrolled in the fall amounts to $11,674. That is significantly more than what the United States spent per pupil 30 years earlier, when governments spent the equivalent of $6,037 per student.

Rhee is slightly off when she says ""more than doubled,"" but not by much. Per-student elementary and secondary school education spending -- when adjusted for inflation -- increased 93 percent from 1976 to 2006.

For the record, Florida officials say the state spends about $6,900 per student currently. Scott is proposing to shrink per-student funding to about $6,200. 
What's been the payback?

What the country has gotten for that investment -- especially over a 30-year period -- is much more difficult to determine because there are few uniform rankings to consider.

We first tried to compare the United States education system to other countries in the world.

The United States and Europe began discussing a way to measure worldwide academic progress in the 1960s. But the talks produced a series of tests measuring different-aged students in different subjects. And none of them appear to be acceptable ways to measure educational progress over 30 years.

The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study measures trends in reading literacy achievement of fourth-grade students. But the test has been administered only in 2001 and 2006. A third test is scheduled for 2011. The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study has been around since 1995. And the Programme for International Student Assessment measures 15-year-olds, but wasn't administered until 2000.

The National Center on Education and the Economy tried to normalize the assessments in 2005 by analyzing results from 1995-2003 in math, reading and science. The United States did not make the top 10 countries in any category.

The most recent PISA results, from 2009, were even more sobering.

In reading literacy, 15-year-old American students were average performers and the U.S. showed little improvement in reading since 2000. Overall, the U.S. ranked 14th. In math, U.S. 15-year-olds ranked 25th, below average. In science, 17th. Education Secretary Arne Duncan pointed out that funding wasn't the problem that had American students lagging -- noting that students in Estonia and Poland perform at roughly the same level as those in the U.S., even though Estonia and Poland spend less than half as much per student.

""The hard truth is that other high-performing nations have passed us by during the last two decades,"" Duncan said on Dec. 7, 2010, after the PISA results were announced. ""In a highly competitive knowledge economy, maintaining the educational status quo means America's students are effectively losing ground."" 
One more troubling statistic. According again to the National Center on Education and the Economy, the United States graduated a higher percentage of its working age adults from high school in the 1970s than any other country in the world. Today, a handful of other countries now best the United States, and many other countries are quickly catching up. 
Yet what's critical to note is that none of those statistics explicitly mean American students are performing worse, especially over a period of three decades. They simply mean that students in some other countries are improving more rapidly than U.S. students. Andreas Schleicher, a senior education official at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, testified before a U.S. Senate committee that Americans were losing the advantages they gained by massively increasing education enrollments after World War II.

""Two generations ago, South Korea had the economic output of Afghanistan today and was at rank 24 in terms of educational output among today's OECD countries,"" Schleicher said. ""Today it is the top performer in terms of the proportion of successful school leavers, with 96 percent of an age cohort obtaining a high school degree. Similar trends are visible in college education, where the U.S. slipped between 1995 and 2005 from rank 2 to rank 14, not because U.S. college graduation rates declined, but because they rose so much faster in many OECD countries."" 
Without 30 years of data to analyze education systems around the world, we next looked for ways to compare solely U.S. student performance. 
Turns out we had better luck. 
One of the best strings of data comes from the Department of Education's National Assessment of Educational Progress, an assessment authorized by Congress, which measures U.S. students in reading, mathematics, science, writing, U.S. history, civics, geography and other subjects.

Reading scores are available for 9-, 13- and 17-year-old students periodically starting in 1971. The first of 11 assessments in math began in 1973.

In that span -- from 1971-2008 -- how have U.S. students performed on the test?

Contrary to what Rhee has suggested, at every age level and in both math and reading, students have improved.

In reading, average scores were 12 points higher than in 1971 for 9-year-olds and four points higher for 13-year-olds. The average score for 17-year-olds improved, but was not significantly different compared to 1971.

In math, it's the same story. Average scores were 24 points higher than in 1973 for 9-year-olds and 15 points higher for 13-year-olds. The average score for 17-year-olds was higher, though not significantly different than in 1973, according to NAEP results.

Looking on a trend line, the results show slight to modest gains for students both in reading and mathematics. That's comparing the American students of 30 years ago to the American students of today. 
We contacted Rhee's schools group, Students First, but did not hear back.

Our ruling

During her trip to Florida, Rhee said that Americans, in the last 30 years, ""have more than doubled the amount of money we are spending per child (on education) … and the results have gotten worse, not better.""

Per-pupil education spending has grown significantly over the past 30 years, and the United States spends among the most to educate its K-12 students. But to say that student results have gotten worse is simplifying things a bit.

Maybe the return for the increased spending isn't what people want, but student performance in math and reading has improved slightly over the past 30 years, according to statistics kept by the U.S. Department of Education. Different assessments essentially show that U.S. students have failed to make the gains that other countries have. But they haven't showed U.S. students performing worse.

Whoopi Goldberg says that sexting is a felony in Texas, carrying a sentence of up to 10 years in prison
","
State Sen. Kirk Watson has an ally célèbre in his effort to create a law that would better address ""sexting"" among teenagers texting nude photos of themselves and others: Whoopi Goldberg, comedian and co-host of ABC’s daytime talk show, The View.

""Words I never figured I’d tweet,"" Watson said on Twitter Feb. 9. ""My sexting bill, discussed on The View.""

Watson linked to video of the previous day’s episode where Goldberg floated his proposal by her co-hosts, Barbara Walters, Joy Behar, Sherri Shepherd and Elisabeth Hasselbeck.

Goldberg said: ""There’s a measure on the table in Texas to make teen sexting a Class C misdemeanor, requiring teens to make a court appearance and parents to attend a ‘sext’ education program. Right now, sexting is a felony offense for teenagers — that can mean up to 10 years in prison.""

Ten years for texting nude photos? ABC spokesman Karl Nilsson pointed us to two news reports on Watson’s measure including a Feb. 7 report by Austin’s KXAN-TV, Channel 36, which appeared on CNN's website Feb. 8. In that report, Watson says prosecutors can either bring sexting cases ""under our very strict child pornography laws, or do nothing.""

Some background: In November, the Austin American-Statesman reported that Watson and Attorney General Greg Abbott were working to allow the prosecution of minors on a Class C misdemeanor charge instead of the third-degree felony charge they now face.

In a 2008 survey by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, 22 percent of teenage girls and 18 percent of teenage boys said they had electronically sent or posted online nude or semi-nude photos of themselves.

Bill Albert, a spokesman for the Washington-based organization, told us the group hasn’t looked into how often sexting has been prosecuted nationwide. Albert suggested we seek information on the prevalence of prosecutions from Parry Aftab, a New Jersey-based privacy lawyer, who estimated that about 50 sexting cases have cropped up nationally in the last year, but Aftab said the majority were dismissed.

Under Watson’s Senate Bill 407, filed Jan. 25, minors could face a year in county jail and up to a $4,000 fine, and judges could order minors and parents to participate in an education program about the social and criminal risks of texting explicit images.

No Texas law specifies sexting as a crime. Instead, as Abbott explains on the attorney general’s website, ""the owner of a computer or cell phone containing pictures of nude or semi-nude minors can be investigated and prosecuted on felony child pornography charges. Teenagers in possession of sexually suggestive images of classmates or companions under 18 could face up to 10 years in prison.""

Abbott adds that prosecution is by no means certain: ""Of course, investigators and prosecutors consider the circumstances of each case before deciding whether — and which — charges may apply."" On Feb. 8, the Statesman reported that Abbott said he was unaware of any Texas teenagers prosecuted under the law. Dayna Blazey, a Travis County assistant district attorney, later echoed Abbott’s rendition of the law; she also had no information on the number of teenage ""sexters""  who have been prosecuted.

Later, Williamson County District Attorney John Bradley told us his office has fielded several sexting claims involving teenagers. He said he couldn’t recall if his office had charged a teenage ""sexter"" with a felony offense, but said that after working with all parties involved, his office has prosecuted teenage ""sexters"" with misdemeanor charges that can lead to a fine, sentences of less than a year in jail or both.

So, Goldberg is correct that a Texas ""sexter"" could now end up with a 10-year prison term, but that’s if they’re prosecuted for child pornography — apparently a rare occurrence. Contrary to Goldberg’s declaration, sexting in itself is not a felony in Texas for anyone, including teenagers.

We rate Goldberg’s statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970B4900>],/factchecks/2011/feb/17/whoopi-goldberg/whoopi-goldberg-says-sexting-felony-texas-carrying/
"['Ohio', 'State Budget', 'John Kasich']","
Gov. John Kasich says some toll workers make $66,000 a year to do the work machines could do
","
Gov. John Kasich took office putting unionized state and local government employees on notice that he is out to end collective bargaining and weaken organized labor groups. Earlier this month, he again signaled that Ohio Turnpike toll collectors are on his hit list but this time offered up a reason why they, too, should be targeted.

In an interview with The Washington Post the governor recounted the challenges that lie ahead as he and state lawmakers began negotiating the next biennial operating budget with an $8 billion deficit looming. Columnist George F. Will, noting that the governor is considering privatizing prisons or leasing the Ohio Turnpike, paraphrases Kasich as saying there are people getting paid $66,000 a year to collect tolls that machines might collect.

While we didn’t hear Kasich’s interview with Will, Kasich has made similar remarks before. His staff confirmed for us that Will recounted his remark correctly and also cited a report on 2009 data from the Buckeye Institute.

But Teamsters Union Local  436, which represents toll collectors, just announced in January that it had agreed to a new three-year deal with the Ohio Turnpike Commission which freezes their hourly pay at $19.50 to start and tops out at $24.41 after five years. Even at the top pay scale, a toll collector who works 40 hours a week for 52 weeks would earn just under $51,000.

In light of that, Politifact Ohio thought it’d check out the governor’s claim.

As it turns out, many toll collectors make big money from overtime work. Some tack on upwards of 30 percent of the base salary in overtime pay, according to the Ohio Turnpike Commission's 2010 ending year salaries.

Indeed, in 2010, five toll collectors made more than $66,000 a year. The highest earner collected $80,719.99, which included $29,964.23 in overtime pay. Of the five, three worked at the Lordstown East location at exit 216 along the toll road. The other two worked at the Eastgate location at exit 238 near the Pennsylvania border.

To be fair, the median pay for the collectors was about $52,000. And only 13 of the 286 full-time collectors earned over $60,000 in base and overtime pay in 2010. Also, in addition to the new contract with a pay freeze, about 90 of the 643 full- and part-time collectors took a buyout as the turnpike commission began trimming its salary budget now that it has the E-Z Pass system.

Still, Kasich is looking for more relief salary relief, especially now that the E-Z Pass system is in place. Also, lowering the turnpike commission's spending could make leasing it a more attractive deal.  Kasich has said that he wants at least $3 billion for the turnpike, though he has not said how many years his ideal turnpike lease would cover.

PolitiFact Ohio sought comment from Teamsters Union Local  436 President Gary M. Tiboni and the union’s direct representative for the Turnpike, Alisha Urbina, but neither returned our calls.

So where does that leave us on the Truth-O-Meter?

Kasich is correct that some toll collectors make as much as $66,000 a year. But only five who made that much in 2010 and only 13 of the state’s 286 full-time collectors (about 4.5 percent) earned over $60,000 that same year. That’s additional information that provides clarification.

Obama says domestic spending headed to lowest level since Eisenhower
","
Correction: This item was updated to reflect that it was fiscal year 1961 when non-security discretionary spending, as a percentage of GDP, was 2.2 percent. That was Eisenhower's last budget. 
Pressing the case for his proposed 2012 budget, President Barack Obama has repeatedly touted the claim that it would cut deeply into the deficit and bring annual domestic spending to its lowest share of the economy since President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Here's how Obama worded it in a speech he made unveiling the budget plan in Baltimore on Feb. 14, 2011.

""I’ve called for a freeze on annual domestic spending over the next five years,"" Obama said. ""This freeze would cut the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade, bringing this kind of spending -- domestic discretionary spending -- to its lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was president. Let me repeat that. Because of our budget, this share of spending will be at its lowest level since Dwight Eisenhower was president. That level of spending is lower than it was under the last three administrations, and it will be lower than it was under Ronald Reagan.""

The rhetoric flying back and forth about Obama's budget from Democrats and Republicans can be dizzying. There are so many ways to present budget figures. But with Republicans attacking Obama's budget as another spending bonanza, we thought it would be helpful to dig deeper into the president's claim about cutting domestic spending to Eisenhower levels.

First, some definitions, because he is not talking about all spending. In fact, he's not talking about the biggest budget drivers, defense and entitlement spending such as Social Security and Medicare.

Obama has used the phrase ""domestic spending"" or ""domestic discretionary spending"" when citing the statistic. But you won't find either term in the actual budget from the White House Office of Management and Budget. A spokeswoman in the Office of Management and Budget said Obama was talking about non-security discretionary spending. Furthermore, when Obama said it will ""bring"" domestic spending, as a percentage of GDP, to Eisenhower levels, he didn't mean next year, he meant by 2015.

So there's some fine print required to understand the president's shorthand.

Let's look at the numbers based on the parameters outlined by the White House. According to an OMB chart on the proposed budget by category as a percentage of GDP (Table S-5), non-security discretionary spending would go from 3.4 percent in 2011 to 2.9 percent in 2012, and down to 2.1 percent in 2015 (see Table S-5, here).

So how does that stack up historically? According to a graphic provided by the White House, the 2.1 percent in 2015 would be the lowest level since FY 1961 under Eisenhower, when the level was 2.2 percent.

At PolitiFact, we like to see original source documents. So we asked for a link to the historical data that informed their graphic. That doesn't exist. It is possible to reconstruct a table using data from publicly available information -- see the ""outlays"" section of this budget data. But believe us, it isn't easy.

However, the government does keep historical records on non-defense discretionary spending as a percentage of GDP. And the projection for 2015 using that measure would be lower than any level since Eisenhower. Non-defense and non-security spending are related, but they're not the same thing. As the name suggests, non-defense includes everything but defense. Non-security, however, includes everything except defense, homeland security, State/International, veterans affairs, and the part of the Department of Energy that deals with nuclear security.

Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a middle-of-the-road budget-hawk group, said Obama's numbers -- while difficult to put into historical context in the form Obama used -- are ""completely plausible.""

""My instinct, given everything else we know, is that they are correct,"" Goldwein said.

The budget analysts at the conservative Heritage Foundation, however, say that the White House, in order to arrive at its discretionary figures, used some accounting gimmicks.

Chiefly, they say, the White House reclassified $54 billion of surface transportation spending from discretionary to mandatory spending. Voila, discretionary spending goes down. To find the switch, see the Table S-7 of the White House budget, which notes changes to the budget baselines and specifically quantifies the yearly budget impact from ""reclassifying surface transportation outlays.""

Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst at Heritage, said it reminded him of an old satirical headline from The Onion: ""Eight Million Americans Rescued From Poverty With Redefinition Of Term.""

Moving surface transportation spending into the mandatory category was actually a recommendation of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, which said it wanted to reconcile the discretionary treatment of outlays with the treatment of contract authority, which is mandatory.

So the White House may have a sound argument for shifting that highway money to the mandatory spending category. Nonetheless, it makes the discretionary spending bottom line look better without any heavy lifting.

Riedl also argued that White House projections for discretionary spending beyond Obama's presidency are largely meaningless. Discretionary spending is set by the president and Congress each year. ""Any number after 2012 is just a placeholder,"" Riedl said.

""I'm more interested in the numbers for next year,"" Riedl said.

In 2012, non-security discretionary spending under Obama's proposed budget would come to 3.4 percent of GDP. According to the White House graphic, that percentage would rival the highest levels in the last 20 years or so.

But Obama talked about ""bringing"" the numbers to Eisenhower levels; he didn't say it would happen next year. So basing the claim on what is projected to happen in 2015 seems reasonable. And almost any way you slice it -- by non-defense, non-security or even total discretionary spending -- if the White House budget projections for 2015 hold up, they would be at the lowest levels, as a percentage of GDP, since the early 1960s at least.

But given that Obama's term ends after 2012 (unless he's re-elected), we think there is some merit to the criticism that ""projections"" about future reductions to discretionary spending are far less meaningful than the ones proposed for the following year. And, while shifting highway money from discretionary to mandatory spending may make sense, it does skew the picture when making comparisons to previous years when it was considered discretionary. So we rate Obama's claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097473C40>],/factchecks/2011/feb/16/barack-obama/obama-says-domestic-spending-headed-lowest-level-e/

Rick Scott cites Amtrak ridership numbers in announcing decision to nix Florida high-speed rail
","
In his stunning but not totally unexpected announcement to reject $2.4 billion in federal money for high-speed rail, Florida Gov. Rick Scott hammered on rosy ridership projections that he believed weren't attainable.

Scott said he was briefed on the most recent ridership studies that found 3.07 million riders would use the 84-mile rail line linking downtown Tampa to the Orlando International Airport. Previous studies said about 2.4 million riders would use the rail line in the first year.

""Ridership and revenue projections are historically overly optimistic and would likely result in ongoing subsidies that state taxpayers would have to incur,"" Scott said during remarks announcing his decision on Feb. 16, 2011.

He later offered evidence to back up his assertion that the rail line was, as he called it, high risk.

""It is projected that 3.07 million people will use the train annually,"" Scott said. ""Keep in mind that Amtrak's Acela train in Washington, D.C., Boston, Philadelphia, New York and Baltimore only had 3.2 million riders in 2010. And that market population is eight times the size of Tampa-Orlando.""

We wanted to check Scott's comparison between the I-4 corridor of Florida and the bustling northeast.

Florida's high-speed line was projected to cost around $2.7 billion to build, with the federal government picking up all but about $300 million. The state originally had said it would put up the remaining funds, but legislators recently suggested that a private business be asked to absorb that cost as part of a contract to operate the rail system.

Original ridership estimates said 2.4 million people would ride the system, with one-way ticket prices ranging between $15 and $30. A full third of those riders would use the train to move between Disney and Orlando International Airport. Under the original study, ridership was projected to grow to more than 3.5 million passengers per year by 2025. 
Scott cited an updated estimate on 3.07 million people per year. Governor's office spokesman Brian Hughes said Scott was briefed about the new estimate from the Florida Department of Transportation and that a copy of the formal study was not yet available.

That leaves us to take Scott at his word. (We'll update this item if the number proves incorrect.)

As for the Acela, Scott is talking about Amtrak's high-speed rail linking the major metro centers of the northeast United States. The train runs between Washington, D.C., and Boston, with stops in Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. The Acela generally has been considered one of the bright spots in Amtrak's portfolio. Nearly 72 percent of the Acela's 300 seats are selling on peak segments -- figures that have improved substantially over the past five years, the Washington Post reported. And while Amtrak relies on federal subsidies to stay in business, Amtrak officials maintain that the Acela line by itself is profitable.

In fiscal year 2010, Amtrak said 3.22 million people rode the Acela, an increase of 200,000 riders compared to 2009.

That puts Scott's comparison on solid footing, but it leaves out an important point.

The Acela service is just part of the Amtrak system in the northeast. Along with the high-speed Acela, Amtrak operates a more traditional regional rail line connecting the major cities of the northeast. The regional rail line has more stops and is slower. In fiscal year 2010, Amtrak reported that an additional 7.15 million people rode the northeast regional rail line.

Total, that means Amtrak trains are serving more than 10 million passengers in the northeast -- not the 3.2 million Scott cited. (For the record, Scott is right about the relative size of the two areas. The population of the Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the northeast is about a combined 38 million, compared to about 5 million for Tampa-Orlando.)

In offering a reason for rejecting $2.4 billion in federal money for high-speed rail, Scott said the ridership projections were overly optimistic, and cited train service in the busy northeast corridor to prove his point. But Scott's reference to the high-speed Acela is only one form of service in that corridor, and he omitted the bigger chunk of Amtrak's passengers when comparing ridership. That's an important detail that would have added more context. We find this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097897B00>],/factchecks/2011/feb/16/rick-scott/rick-scott-cites-amtrak-ridership-numbers-announci/

Newt Gingrich accuses Obama administration of cutting democracy funds for Egypt
","
Just days after Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak yielded to a popular uprising and relinquished power, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., took a shot at the Obama Administration for its handling of Egyptian democracy issues. 
On the Feb. 13, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Gingrich -- a possible 2012 presidential candidate -- said that ""this is an administration which for reasons I don't understand actually cut out the democracy in Egypt funds inside the State Department.""

We thought we’d check to see whether that’s accurate.

First, a little background. The federal government offers two primary sources of democracy funding to Egypt -- through the U.S. Agency for International Development, and through the State Department. It's a small portion of all the aid it gives to Egypt and includes funding for ""civil society"" programs, ""good governance,"" and efforts to advance the ""rule of law and human rights."" Some of this money goes toward independent democracy-building groups, some to the government to improve its transparency, and some to anti-corruption and human-rights efforts. 
Under U.S. AID, there’s a category called ""Governing Justly and Democratically."" 
Meanwhile, under the State Department, the federal government funds two programs that benefit Egypt -- the Middle East Partnership Initiative and the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.

Here’s a description of funding for the U.S. AID portion of that funding since fiscal year 2006, according to a summary by the Project on Middle East Democracy:

Fiscal year 2006 actual funding: $50.0 million
Fiscal year 2007 actual funding: $50.0 million
Fiscal year 2008 actual funding: $54.8 million
Fiscal year 2009 actual funding: $20 million
Fiscal year 2010 estimate: $25 million
Fiscal year 2011 presidential request: $25 million 
The fiscal year 2012 request will not be out for another few weeks, experts said. 
For the sake of context, we should point out that for 2011, democracy funding under these programs accounted for just 2 percent of the U.S. government money that went to Egypt. The rest was for military and security assistance (84 percent) and for other economic assistance (14 percent).

As the table above shows, the funding level for U.S. AID’s Egyptian democracy programs did go down significantly between fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2009, but assigning responsibility for this decline is tricky.

Officially, the cut for fiscal 2009 was enacted by Congress in March 2009 and signed by Obama. But the funding change stemmed from a broader cut put in motion by the administration of George W. Bush.

As if that wasn’t murky enough, it gets even more complicated, said Stephen McInerney, the executive director of the Project on Middle East Democracy, an advocacy group that closely tracks democracy funding in the region.

Initially, the Bush Administration wanted to cut overall economic aid to Egypt from $415 million in fiscal year 2008 to $200 million in fiscal year 2009. But the Bush Administration wanted to protect the fraction of the funding being spent on democracy from cuts.

By the time Congress approved the funding, however, the democracy budget had been slashed by roughly the same percentage as the entire Egypt aid budget. This is the decline Gingrich was referring to.

""The Obama Administration can claim that had the Bush Administration not cut overall economic aid, then the democracy and governance portion would not have gotten cut,"" McInerney said. ""But the Bush Administration could retort that they had specifically designated that the democracy and governance portion not be cut.  And both sides would be correct.""

Now, let’s shift gears and look at the State Department funding.

The two State Department programs serving Egypt and other countries have increased during the Obama administration, but country-by-country figures are not available.

In fact, the State Department programs picked up some slack from the declining U.S. AID budgets, said Tom Malinowski, Washington director for Human Rights Watch.

""After the Obama administration took office, U.S. AID decided to terminate direct grants to unregistered Egyptian pro-democracy groups -- that is, those that did not have official approval from the Egyptian government,"" Malinowski said. ""It was not clear if this was a decision made by the U.S. embassy in Cairo without the knowledge of the very new political leadership in Washington or a decision that had high-level blessing in the new administration. In any case, it did happen on Obama’s early watch. But the Obama administration decided to continue funding the same unregistered Egyptian democracy groups through a different budget account, administered by the State Department, to the tune of $7 million.""

So let’s summarize. Funding from U.S. AID for Egyptian democracy did fall by about half, but that resulted from actions taken by both the Bush and Obama administrations. Meanwhile, democracy funding under the State Department’s budget rose. The Obama administration later sought to increase U.S. AID funding, but neither this increase nor the increase in the State Department’s budget was enough to replace the lost U.S. AID funds.

How does this square with Gingrich’s statement that the Obama administration actually ""cut out the democracy in Egypt funds inside the State Department""? We see a few problems.

First, the Obama administration bears some of the responsibility for the cuts, but the Bush administration does as well. Second, using the term ""cut out"" makes it sound like the funds were eliminated, rather than reduced. Third, the funds that were inside the State Department’s budget actually increased; the ones that were cut were inside U.S. AID’s budget.

Still, Gingrich does have a point. On an overall basis, democracy funding did decline rather significantly during the first two years of the Obama administration, and the administration played a role in that decision. Gingrich’s statement is ""not too far off from a true statement,"" McInerney said. ""If he had dropped the words ‘out’ and ‘inside the State Department,’ then I would consider it to be a true statement.""

We agree, so on balance, we rate Gingrich’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B30340>],/factchecks/2011/feb/16/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-accuses-obama-administration-cutting/

Group says Gov. Scott Walker threatened to send out the National Guard if workers protest his proposed changes to bargaining laws
","
When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker announced bold plans to strip public employee unions of most of their powers and make government workers pay more for their benefits, he included this footnote:

If state employees reacted with job actions that would disrupt services, Walker said he was prepared to call on the National Guard for help.

Some Democratic-leaning organizations, however, took the new Republican governor’s warning to mean something more.

The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a Washington, D.C., organization that backed former Democratic Wisconsin senator Russ Feingold in his failed 2010 re-election bid, said it sent an e-mail to 13,000 of its Wisconsin members on Feb. 14, 2011, that contained this line in bold:

""Walker has threatened to call out the National Guard if workers protest against these cuts!""

It goes on to say:

""The idea that a governor can use the military to impose his personal, political will on the people he governs is a primitive relic of the past -- one that resulted in a century of bloodshed in this country. The last time military force was used against workers was during the Memphis sanitation strike in 1968, just days before Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination. It must not be repeated again.""

Walker certainly anticipated a strong reaction from government employees to his plans to strip bargaining rights and increase their contributions to pensions and health care premiums.

But did he threaten to call out the National Guard in response to protests?

And did he threaten to use them in this manner, to use force to ""impose his personal, political will""?

Like the progressive committee, Citizen Action of Wisconsin issued a news release the same day that condemned Walker’s ""threat of force"" and mentioned the King assassination. That release also cited the Bay View Massacre of 1886, when seven workers protesting for the eight-hour workday were shot and killed.

We asked the progressive committee for evidence to back its claim that Walker threatened to summon the National Guard in response to protests.

It cited three Feb. 11 news stories: 
None of those reports quoted Walker directly, so let’s see what he actually said at the news conference where he announced his proposals.

Walker made reference to having made contingency plans and was asked by a reporter whether they included the National Guard.

""In state government, we have had, before I’ve taken office, plans for contingencies no matter what the circumstances. We have updated those,"" Walker said. ""I got a full briefing from all the major, level-one state agencies as well as the
the National Guard yesterday (Feb. 10). We are fully prepared and equipped to handle whatever may occur. So we have every confidence we can move forward on that.

""But again, you plan for the worst, you expect the best. And I expect from the good men and women who work for state and local government that they’re going to continue to do the good, professional job they do each and every day.""

Referring to the Guard, he added:

""They’re not called up at this point. We obviously have a whole series of circumstances that would lead to that. I’m not anticipating that, I’m not expecting that, but I want to make everyone certain in this state that I’m fully prepared for whatever may happen.""

When he spoke later that day to Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, Walker used the example of the National Guard helping run state prisons in the event of a strike by corrections workers.

In an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie wrote:  ""In the unlikely event that core government services are disrupted the Guard would be used just to continue those services. That’s what the National Guard does.""

Indeed, demonstrations over Walker’s proposals were held in Madison and elsewhere in Wisconsin on Feb. 14 and 15, with thousands of people showing up, but the National Guard was not summoned.

And on Feb. 15, the Guard issued a news release saying it ""has not been mobilized for state active duty"" and ""we remain in our normal state of readiness.""

Let’s return to the statement.

The Progressive Change Campaign Committee said Walker ""threatened to call out the National Guard if workers protest against these cuts!"" The governor spoke of possibly calling up the Guard if state workers didn’t show up for work, but he made no reference to using it in response to protests. And certainly none that would suggest the Guard is authorized to use force to impose anything on state workers.
