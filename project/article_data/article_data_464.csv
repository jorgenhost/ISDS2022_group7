Kellyanne Conway misleads on name for COVID-19, says it’s ‘not COVID-1’
","In a swipe at the World Health Organization, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway made a misleading claim about COVID-19, implying that the disease caused by the novel coronavirus was so named because it’s the latest in a string of similar coronaviruses.  ""Some of the scientists and doctors say there could be other strains later on, this could come back in the fall in a limited way,"" Conway said in an April 15 ""Fox & Friends"" interview. ""This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, folks. And so you would think that people charged with the World Health Organization facts and figures would be on top of that."" ""People should know the facts,"" she added.  The comment came one day after President Donald Trump announced his intention to halt U.S. funding to the WHO and review its handling of the virus.  But the name of the disease doesn’t mean the WHO had 18 chances to learn about coronaviruses before the latest strain hit.  COVID-19 is short for ""coronavirus disease 2019,"" a name that reflects the year in which the disease was first identified. The WHO announced the name on Feb. 11. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""CO"" stands for ""corona,"" ""VI"" stands for ""virus,"" and ""D"" stands for ""disease."" Before the WHO formalized a name for the disease, it was referred to as the ""2019 novel coronavirus"" or ""2019-nCoV."" The virus itself, by contrast, is known as ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" and abbreviated as ""SARS-CoV-2,"" according to the WHO. The CDC lists seven coronaviruses that are known to infect humans, some of which are relatively common. Conway was clearer about the origins of ""COVID-19"" during a separate interview with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo roughly 30 minutes after her comment on ""Fox & Friends."" ""It’s called COVID-19 because that’s the year, that’s the year,"" Conway said while ripping the WHO’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. ""It’s not COVID-20. It’s COVID-19."" Facing blowback for her ""Fox & Friends"" comment, Conway tweeted the clip from her interview with Bartiromo. She said she knows ""19 refers to (the) year,"" but that she was making the point that the WHO ""should see pandemics coming"" because of the funding it gets from the U.S.   Dear @RepBobbyRush: I know 19 refers to year. I’m in Task Force daily (Congress is out until May 4). Point: WHO has received billion$ from USA for decades; it should see pandemics coming & be honestWhich felt better:insulting me or endorsing Bloomberg for President?God bless https://t.co/3LpvkoQERb In a statement to PolitiFact, a White House official said Conway is ""well aware that ‘19’ refers to the year"" and that she attends meetings held by the White House’s coronavirus task force.  Conway was addressing ""the sheer number of years the U.S. has given billions and billions of dollars to WHO and were failed by them,"" the White House said, adding that in each of her April 15 interviews, she said the WHO’s job is to anticipate infectious disease pandemics. ""Kellyanne never mentioned ‘18 other coronaviruses,’"" the White House said. Conway said, ""This is COVID-19, not COVID-1,"" arguing that the WHO should have been better prepared to deal with the virus.  ""People should know the facts,"" she added. We agree. The name of the disease caused by the coronavirus, COVID-19, doesn’t mean it’s the 19th in a series of similar coronaviruses. The 19 refers to the year it was discovered, 2019.  Conway made the claim with a straight-face, but she later said she knew what the name meant.

No, you don’t have to pay back your stimulus check
","Are those $1,200 payments that are meant to cushion the financial blow of the coronavirus just a loan that Americans will have to pay back next year? That’s what a variety of social media posts are saying. A reader sent us a link to a YouTube video titled, ""Truth About Those Stimulus Checks."" In turn, this YouTube video showed a TikTok created by user @hunnerj9797. (This TikTok has also been shared via Facebook.) Here’s the transcript of the TikTok: ""This is something I found out today about those $1,200 stimulus checks that you may be receiving with the new coronavirus stimulus package bill. Where am I getting my information? Literally, directly from the bill itself. If you go to 'Subtitle B: Rebates and Other Individual Provisions,' it outlines exactly what you're going to get: the $1,200, $2,400 for the joint, for equal and qualified persons.  ""See, what they don't tell you is this is just an advance on your next tax return. 'There shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by Subtitle A for the first taxable year beginning in 2020.' It even further outlines it is literally 'an advance refund amount.' So that means next year, you're automatically going to owe $1,200 come tax season. Guys, stay safe out there. Media and public is not telling you exactly what this bill is."" At issue are checks being cut by the federal government for essentially every American who doesn’t exceed the income cutoff.  The amount of these checks (or direct deposits) will be $1,200 per adult and $500 per child under age 17, as long as you don’t have income exceeding $75,000 per individual or $150,000 per couple. This means a family of four would get $3,400. (Above those income cutoffs, you’ll still get a check, but it will phase out by $5 for every $100 in additional income.) In our analysis of the bill shortly before it passed, we wrote that Americans won’t have to pay taxes on the stimulus checks. Analysts told us that the government is effectively implementing a tax cut for 2020 and giving people an advance on what they would have saved.  Is that still the plan? When we checked in with tax experts, they told us the TikTok offers a misreading of the coronavirus relief bill. (Admittedly, the legislative language is tough to parse.) Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, said the rebate in the law is a refundable tax credit, meaning that people are entitled to the full amount they qualify for, even if they do not owe any income taxes.  The law also says the credit is based on the taxpayer’s circumstances in 2020. But for now, neither the IRS nor the taxpayer knows how much income they will receive in 2020.  ""So the act specifies that the rebate paid now, in advance, will be based on the information from the most recent tax return filed with the IRS,"" Holtzblatt told PolitiFact. That would be either the 2019 return, if it’s filed already, or else the 2018 return. Now, flash-forward to early 2021, when a 2020 tax return will be filed. At that time, the amount of the rebate will be recomputed based on the actual 2020 income. ""If the taxpayer should have gotten more than the advance credit paid this year, then he or she will get the additional amount next year,"" Holtzblatt said.  However, if it turns out that the taxpayer got a larger advance rebate based on their 2019 or 2018 return, the law says that they do not have to pay back the excess, she said.  To make this more concrete, Holtzblatt offered a few scenarios for a taxpayer who ended up receiving $1,000 this year rather than the maximum of $1,200: • If the 2020 tax return shows that they should have received $1,200, the taxpayer will get the additional $200 next year. • If the 2020 tax return shows that they should have received $1,000, they get nothing additional and they owe nothing back. • If the 2020 tax return shows that they should have received $800, the taxpayer does not owe back the excess $200 they received the year before. The posts say that the $1,200 coronavirus relief checks being issued this year are ""just an advance on your next tax return. … Next year, you're automatically going to owe $1,200 come tax season."" That’s not what the law says. Even if someone receives more in 2020 than their next tax return said they should have received, they will not owe back the difference, much less the entire amount.

Michigan's COVID-19 order doesn’t ban gardening or sale of seeds and fruit
","In a regular feature called ""How the Left Destroys the Nation,"" a website founded by the leader of a far-right group posted this headline about one state’s coronavirus response:  ""Michigan Governor Bans Gardening, Sale Of Fruit and Vegetable Seeds, Gardening Supplies Prohibited."" The attack on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat who has been touted as a potential running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That’s because it’s wrong. Whitmer has issued orders directing people to stay home and limiting some commercial activity, but this claim goes too far.  The headline appears on the Geller Report, a website by Pamela Geller. She is an activist who co-founded Stop Islamization of America, also known as the American Freedom Defense Initiative. Below the headline is an article that originally appeared in The Daily Caller, a conservative-leaning publication, that reports on an executive order issued by Whitmer in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The article does not say that the order bans gardening, but that it does restrict the sale of gardening supplies. In reality, executive order 2020-42, which went into effect April 9, 2020, requires larger stores to block off certain areas of their sales floors as a way of limiting the number of people in those stores. The order does not ban gardening or the sale of any product, including, as we mentioned in a previous fact-check, American flags. The numbers of coronavirus cases in Michigan have surged in recent weeks. As of April 14, the Wolverine State ranked fourth — behind New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, according to the New York Times.  Nearly half of Michigan’s cases are in Wayne County, which includes Detroit, according to Johns Hopkins University. Both the state and the county have a COVID-19 fatality rate of 6%. It’s in that climate that Whitmer issued this order, subtitled the ""Temporary requirement to suspend activities that are not necessary to sustain or protect life,"" which extended and added to a stay-at-home order issued March 23. Tiffany Brown, a spokeswoman for the governor, told PolitiFact that Whitmer’s order does not ban Michiganders from buying any item. The order says that stores larger than 50,000 square feet must close areas — ""by cordoning them off, placing signs in aisles, posting prominent signs, removing goods from shelves, or other appropriate means — that are dedicated to the following classes of goods: Carpet or flooring, furniture, garden centers and plant nurseries, and paint."" Referring to that restriction at a news conference announcing the order, Whitmer said: ""If you’re not buying food or medicine or other essential items, you should not be going to the store."" As to gardening, a frequently asked questions document released by the governor’s office states: ""The order does not prohibit homeowners from tending to their own yards as they see fit."" Grocery stores, of course, remain open. And neither the order nor the FAQs mention any restriction on the sale of fruit or seeds. A headline shared on social media inaccurately describes an order that Whitmer issued in response to the coronavirus.  The order does not prohibit gardening or the sale of any particular product in Michigan. Stores in Michigan larger than 50,000 square feet must close areas for garden centers and plant nurseries, as well as those that sell carpet or flooring, furniture and paint.

No evidence Bill Murray said social media is linked to depression

Has Illinois fallen behind other states in testing for the coronavirus?
","The U.S. still lags behind a number of other countries in the share of its population that’s been tested for COVID-19. But how do individual states within the U.S. compare with one another? That’s a subject Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot raised at a news conference while highlighting the need for increased testing capacity in Illinois to respond to the outbreak. ""Illinois lags way behind all of our neighbors and certainly we’re in the bottom tier of states that are doing testing because of the availability,"" Lightfoot said on April 7. ""It’s not for lack of desire, it’s for lack of the tests themselves, the reagents, some of the other materials that we need to be able to process the tests."" Illinois, like many states, has struggled to expand testing due to the national shortage of tests and other supplies. And while the numbers are improving, Gov. J.B. Pritzker has said the state is still falling short of the goal he set for performing 10,000 tests per day. In an interview aired on April 14, the governor said the state is now conducting almost 8,000. But Illinois is not unique in the testing challenges it is facing, so we wondered whether the state was really as far behind as Lightfoot suggested. In response to our inquiry, a spokeswoman for the mayor’s office acknowledged testing figures have improved somewhat from several weeks ago, but provided a March 27 report from ABC 7 that found more than half of all states had done more testing than Illinois had after accounting for population size, including neighboring Wisconsin. Those results were based on data from March 26 — almost two weeks before the mayor made her comparison. Given how rapidly testing data are fluctuating, we decided to evaluate her claim based on more recent figures. To do that, we turned to data from the COVID Tracking Project, a source Lightfoot’s office pointed to in a later response. The project, which is managed and updated by volunteer journalists and scientists, gathers data from state health departments around the country and provides figures on the total number of tests conducted by both public and commercial labs. Its database shows Lightfoot was partly right and partly wrong when she said Illinois was testing at a rate that put it behind all its neighbors as well as in the ""bottom tier"" nationwide. The day Lightfoot made her claim, Illinois ranked 28 out of all 50 states for testing on a per capita basis, figures from the project show. Its ranking has improved only slightly in the time since, with the state coming in 24th as of April 14. Its current tally of just over 110,600 total tests comes out to about 8,730 tests per million residents. New York, which tops the list, has run more than 25,650 tests per million. But Lightfoot’s Illinois comparison doesn’t hold when it comes to the states it borders. On the day she made her claim, Illinois came out slightly ahead of Wisconsin, Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana and Iowa. And in the days since, its lead has continued to grow. Given how frequently testing figures change — along with differences in the ways states report their data — that lead in the Midwest may not mean much. But it’s enough to show Lightfoot is incorrect in her assertion that Illinois is trailing the region. Lightfoot said, ""Illinois lags way behind all of our neighbors and certainly we’re in the bottom tier of states that are doing testing."" At the time Lightfoot made her statement, Illinois did lag a majority of states nationally in terms of the share of its population that had been tested for COVID-19, according to data compiled by an independent reporting project. But the same dataset shows Illinois tested — and continues to test — more residents per capita than the states it borders. We rate Lightfoot’s claim Half True.

Widespread Facebook post blames 2006 law for US Postal Service’s financial woes
","As Washington scrambled to prop up businesses stung by the impact of COVID-19, President Donald Trump reportedly threatened to reject a version of the recently-signed stimulus package that contained funding for the U.S. Postal Service. According to the Washington Post, Trump would have blocked the CARES Act had it included a $13 billion grant for the Postal Service instead of the $10 billion loan from the final version. Trump has long been critical of the Postal Service, saying as recently as April 7 that the service ""has lost billions of dollars every year"" and has an unfair relationship with Amazon.  But a widespread Facebook post says Trump’s frustrations are misguided, and that members of his own party are actually to blame for the Postal Service’s financial problems. ""The Postal Service is not losing money because of Amazon,"" the post says. ""It’s losing money because in 2006, the Republican-led Congress passed a law forcing it to prepay its pensions for 75 years, which no other corporation does. This was meant to bankrupt it so it’s business could be privatized for profit. Without this law, the Postal Service would be turning a profit."" The post has been around more than a year, but it was picked up April 13 by the AFL-CIO, a federation of labor unions. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  In this case, the post is accurate in some ways, and misleading in others. Kalina Newman, a spokesperson for the AFL-CIO, cited a 2010 Postal Service report and a CNBC article. A lame-duck Republican Congress did pass a financially burdensome law in 2006 requiring the Postal Service to pre-fund health benefits for future retirees, and the service’s deal with Amazon hasn’t proven to be the money drain that Trump has said it is. But the service has more financial problems than just the requirements of the 2006 law. We won’t weigh in on whether the law was ""meant to bankrupt"" the Postal Service. The Postal Service is a unique agency. It's meant to be self-sustaining, paying for itself from the money it makes off postage and other daily mail services.  But it also has to follow rules set by Congress that result in higher costs — notably, it’s expected to deliver mail daily and keep postage rates flat for all parts of the country. The rise of the internet tanked the volume of first-class mail in circulation, which peaked in 2001 and has dropped every year since. Costs, on the other hand, haven’t gone down.  The coronavirus has sent those problems spiraling out of control. Mail volumes have declined and sales are ""plummeting,"" Postmaster General Megan Brennan said in a recent statement.  A U.S. Postal worker makes a delivery with gloves and a mask in Warren, Michigan, on April 2, 2020. (AP/Sancya) ""We now estimate that the COVID-19 pandemic will increase the Postal Service’s net operating loss by more than $22 billion dollars over the next 18 months, and by over $54 billion dollars over the longer term,"" Brennan said. While the Postal Service has seen declines in first-class and marketing mail, growth in shipping and packaging — which includes Amazon — has been a bright spot.  In 2019, the Postal Service reported a net loss of $8.8 billion, but the shipping and packages segment of its business increased revenue by $1.3 billion, or 6.1%, over 2018. Amazon and other bulk suppliers do get a special rate, as the Postal Service provides discounts to companies for which it does last-mile delivery. But it’s at least a break-even venture.  That’s because the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act — the law responsible for the retiree health benefit requirement — made it illegal for the Postal Service to price parcel delivery below its cost. One study said the Postal Service could be charging more, however.  The 2006 law also established a fund for Postal Service retiree health benefits. It required prepayment of those benefits according to a 50-year schedule, starting with 10 years of statutorily prescribed payments of roughly $5 billion from 2007 to 2017.  Previously, the service funded the benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis. The act was passed by a Republican-led Congress. But it dealt with retiree health benefits, not pensions, said David Partenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service. There’s also some confusion over whether the Postal Service was forced to prepay benefits ""for 75 years,"" as the Facebook post said. The language of the law doesn’t mention 75 years, and Partenheimer said the Postal Service has not used that timeframe to describe the requirement. In 2012, the Government Accountability Office said the act ""did not require USPS to prefund 75 years of retiree health benefits over a 10-year period"" but that the ""payments would be projected to fund the liability over a period in excess of 50 years, from 2007 through 2056 and beyond."" Regardless, Partenheimer told us that ""the pre-funding requirement included in the 2006 law is a major reason for our financial situation, along with an outdated business model."" The Postal Service began defaulting on its payments in 2012. A fact sheet said that without defaulting, the service ""would not have been able to pay our employees, our suppliers, or deliver the mail"" — a point the postmaster general reiterated in 2019 congressional testimony. James O’Rourke, a teaching professor of management at the University of Notre Dame, said the Facebook post is ""more-or-less correct"" about the 2006 law. ""This advance funding requirement places a burden of about $6.6 billion on the postal service that would not exist if they followed a pay-as-you-go approach,"" O’Rourke said. ""This burden has quite nearly bankrupted the USPS over a 15-year period."" But Jim Campbell, a private attorney and an expert on postal service laws, said the 2006 law also freed the Postal Service of a prior obligation to cover pension costs for military service its employees completed before joining the Postal Service.  A 2009 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said that shift relieved the Postal Service of a $27 billion cost. Campbell said that when the 2006 law was enacted, it was expected that relief from prior costs would ""more or less completely offset the new obligation."" Still, no other federal agency faces a similar pre-funding mandate, O’Rourke said. Private companies that do pre-fund their future retirees’ health benefits don’t usually cover 100% of those costs in advance, a 2015 CRS report said. The Facebook post suggests that if the Postal Service could get rid of the 2006 law, everything else would be fine. But the reality is more bleak — especially now. ""The problem with the Postal Service is just much more fundamental than this,"" Campbell said. It does appear that the law’s elimination would have brought some relief. The progressive Institute for Policy Studies wrote that ""if the costs of this retiree health care mandate were removed from the USPS financial statements,"" the Postal Service would’ve reported operating profits from 2013 through 2018. That’s accurate, according to a chart from the Trump administration’s 2018 report on the Postal Service. In congressional testimony last year, Postal Service board member David Williams said the pre-funding requirement has been ""devastating"" not only because it limited other spending, but also because it ""wiped out our entire ability to make capital investments"" to modernize. Still, as we noted in 2011, the Postal Service’s problems are greater than the retirement rules.  The service’s own fact sheet says a House bill to scrap the pre-funding requirement ""will not reduce our underlying liability for retiree health benefits, nor improve our cash flow or long-term financial position."" COVID-19 has worsened that position further in recent weeks. ""The USPS is forecast to lose tens of billions of dollars over the next decade,"" the Trump administration’s 2018 report said. ""Standalone proposals, such as forgiving the prefunding of post-employment benefits or renegotiating labor contracts, will be insufficient."" ""If left unattended, closure of the U.S. Postal Service in the years just ahead remains a possibility,"" O’Rourke added. A Facebook post said: ""The Postal Service is not losing money because of Amazon. It’s losing money because in 2006, the Republican-led Congress passed a law forcing it to prepay its pensions for 75 years, which no other corporation does … Without this law, the Postal Service would be turning a profit."" The Postal Service isn’t losing money from its deal with Amazon. But the 2006 law requiring the pre-funding of health benefits for future retirees — not pensions — has put a financial strain on the Postal Service and hurt its ability to turn a profit in some recent years.  However, the Postal Service has more financial problems than just the requirements of the law.  We rate this statement Half True.",/factchecks/2020/apr/15/afl-cio/widespread-facebook-post-blames-2006-law-us-postal/

But as the city struggles with the mounting death toll amid the pandemic, burials on the island have dramatically increased in recent weeks.   There are usually about 25 burials on the island each week, the New York mayor’s press secretary Freddie Goldstein told CNN. But that number has climbed to nearly 25 each day. The island’s interment operation is managed by the city’s Department of Correction, and inmates usually assist in the burials. But that has changed since the pandemic. DOC spokesperson Jason Kersten has said that city inmates are not currently involved with the burials: ""For social distancing and safety reasons, city-sentenced people in custody are not assisting in burials for the duration of the pandemic. Contracted laborers are performing this important work under DOC supervision,"" according to a report by the Gothamist. Bodies are ordinarily held at the city’s morgues anywhere from 30 to 60 days, Goldstein said. But to make room for the influx of deceased individuals during the pandemic, the city’s medical examiner’s office announced a new policy of holding unclaimed bodies for only up to 15 days before they are transferred to the island. New York City’s Hart Island has been used as a public cemetery for unclaimed bodies since the 1800s, but the city’s staggering death toll amid the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically increased the number of burials on the island.  Social media posts about the burials are mostly accurate, but many need additional information.

"['Coronavirus', 'Bobby  Scott']","
Did the U.S. in April rank last in per capita Covid-19 testing?
","U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., recently criticized President Donald Trump for not taking the Covid-19 pandemic ""seriously."" As proof, Scott cited the critical lack of test kits in the United States despite almost two months of warnings early this year before the disease hit American shores. ""If you line up all the countries that have done testing on a per capita basis, we’re at the bottom of the list,"" Scott said during an April 2 radio interview on the conservative John Fredericks Show based in Portsmouth. Governors from both parties and health-care experts have complained that the lack of Covid-19 tests has hampered efforts to combat the disease. Trump has said things have picked up and the U.S. has now conducted more tests than any nation. PolitiFact has debunked a similar Trump claim, noting that the U.S. has a high population and it lags in the key comparison measurement - the number of conducted tests per capita. But we wondered whether the U.S. really is at the bottom of nations in per capita testing, as Scott said. So we did a fact check. Statistical stew Let’s start by emphasizing that global comparisons of Covid-19 testing are tenuous because nations measure it differently.  Our World in Data, a research organization funded by philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates, collects statistics from 50 nations and notes some countries count the total number of tests performed, others report the number of people tested, others tally the number of tests that have been analyzed. The organization says for many nations, it’s unclear what method is used. The group says the varied reporting does not produce ""meaningful comparisons"" of nations. The U.S. does not have a central source of statistics on testing, most of which is done by private labs. A widely-cited unofficial count comes from The Covid Tracking Project, a data set that journalists and scientists collect statistics from states and localities - which also have different ways of compiling numbers. Scott’s proof We asked Scott’s press office for the source of the congressman’s claim that the U.S. ranks last among testing nations. We were sent a March 12, 2020 Vox article with a chart showing the U.S. had conducted only 23 Covid-19 tests per 1 million people. That was the fewest among eight comparison nations: Japan, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Israel, Taiwan, Italy, South Korea and the Guangdong Province of China.  Vox said it drew its statistics from a variety of sources, including the Covid Tracking Project. Even if we overlook the difficulties in comparing testing data, a huge problem remains: Scott was using March 12 figures to describe the situation on April 2 - the day of his interview.   Conditions change fast with the coronavirus. The U.S. had conducted 10,262 tests through March 12, according to Tracking Project estimates. By April 2, it was up to 1.3 million. On the day Scott made his statement, Vox put a note on its three-week-old article saying there had been "" significant developments in the coronavirus pandemic since this story was last updated, and details may no longer apply."" As of April 13, the project estimated the U.S. had run 2.9 million tests. Vox no longer ranks the U.S. last in per capita testing. On April 13, it placed the U.S. fifth among nine nations: Italy, Germany, Canada, South Korea, Netherlands, U.K., France and Taiwan. Our ruling Scott said on April 2, ""If you line up all the countries that have done (Covid-19) testing on a per capita basis, we’re at the bottom of the list.""   His statement was based on an early-March estimate by Vox that was outdated when Scott spoke. U.S. testing had expanded 130-fold by April 2, and has doubled again in the last two weeks. Vox now estimates the U.S. is somewhere near the middle. Other, more expansive research notes that nations differ in how they collect data, preventing ""meaningful comparisons."" There’s widespread agreement the U.S. got off to a slow start on testing and, despite gains, far greater testing is still essential. But the burden falls on Scott to prove his claim that the U.S. was last per capita in early April, and his evidence doesn’t stand up. So, we rate his statement False.  ",/factchecks/2020/apr/15/bobby-scott/did-us-april-rank-last-capita-covid-19-testing/

Too soon to compare number of COVID deaths to past outbreaks
","A Facebook user suspecting a conspiracy suggests that despite global shutdowns to stem COVID-19 spread , this virus isn’t as deadly as four other historic outbreaks. ""In 1957, Asian flu killed 1 million people. In 1968, Hong Kong flu killed 1 to 4 million people. Swine flu caused 18,000 deaths, bird flu caused 75,000 deaths,"" the April 6, 2020, post says. ""All these viruses killed more people than coronavirus and yet they've never, ever shut anything down. So, what are the government not telling the public? Or, am I the only one confused by this?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As for the number of deaths, the numbers in the Facebook post are correct with respect to one outbreak. All of the other numbers are largely inaccurate. More importantly, it is too early to say what the final death toll will be for COVID-19. The pandemic is still raging and hasn’t run nearly as long as the other four outbreaks. ""The coronavirus pandemic has just begun,"" Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases specialist at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security. ""The numbers for the influenza pandemics are their complete impact over a full season and therefore not comparable to the numbers that have accrued thus far for the coronavirus pandemic."" We’ll cite the outbreaks as they are referred to by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  This new influenza A, known as the Asian flu, was first reported in Singapore in February 1957, Hong Kong in April 1957 and in coastal cities in the United States in summer 1957, according to the CDC.  Total estimated deaths: 1.1 million, roughly what the Facebook post claims, including 116,000 in the United States. What the post calls the ""Hong Kong flu"" was an influenza A that is believed to have originated in Hong Kong and was first noted in the United States in September 1968, according to the CDC.  Total estimated deaths, according to the CDC: 1 million, including 100,000 in the United States.  The post claimed the figure was 1 million to 4 million, a range Britannica.com also uses. The encyclopedia doesn’t cite a source for that range. Other sources, including GlobalSecurity.org, refer to 1 million deaths or in the range of 750,000 to 1 million deaths (Medscape medical website, Nieman Foundation for Journalism).   The H1N1 influenza virus was discovered in the United States in the spring of 2009 and spread around the world. The World Health Organization declared an end to the pandemic in August 2010, according to the CDC. It was originally referred to as ""swine flu"" because many genes in the virus were similar to influenza viruses that normally occur in pigs in North America. Total estimated deaths: 151,700 to 575,400, far more than the 18,000 claimed in the post. An estimated 12,469 deaths occurred from April 2009 to April 2010 in the United States.  What the post refers to as ""bird flu"" was not a pandemic and is an outlier in this context. Says the CDC: Avian influenza A outbreaks occur in poultry from time to time, and some of those outbreaks have been associated with illness and death in people in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Pacific, and the Near East. ""While very rare, some avian influenza A viruses have also caused illness in people in North America.""  The post claims 75,000 deaths from bird flu. But only 455 human deaths from avian influenza A (H5N1) were reported to the World Health Organization from 2003 to Jan. 20, 2020. None of the deaths were in the United States.  The coronavirus surfaced in China in late December. According to the World Health Organization, there were 67,594 deaths, including 8,358 in the United States, as of April 6, 2020, the date of the Facebook post. There were 1,210,956 confirmed cases globally as of that date, which creates a case fatality rate of 5.6%. That’s up from a 3.4% rate cited by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization’s director-general, at a news conference on the coronavirus on March 3, 2020. So far, it’s dramatically higher than the case fatality rates for the three pandemics listed in the Facebook post, all of which were in a range of 0.5% or less, according to the New England Journal of Medicine and Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and director of the Center for Global Health Studies at Seton Hall University. But the rate can vary considerably during an outbreak, the World Health Organization told us.  At this relatively early stage, estimating the case fatality rate is difficult for several reasons, according to an article The Lancet, a British medical journal: The virus and its clinical course are new, and we still have little information about them.  Health care capacity and capability factors, including the availability of health-care workers, resources, facilities, and preparedness, affect outcomes. An unknown number of COVID-19 cases are uncounted, including people with the virus who don’t have symptoms, or people who are misdiagnosed. A Facebook post that questions the lethality of COVID-19 cites specific figures in claiming that the Asian, Hong Kong, swine and bird flus each ""killed more people than coronavirus."" The post is correct on the number of people killed only for the Asian flu.  What the post calls the Asian, Hong Kong and swine flus each killed more people worldwide than COVID-19 has so far. But raw-number comparisons are meaningless, given that those pandemics each ran well over a year, and the COVID-19 outbreak is only four months old.

Meme says Hillary Clinton 'refuses' to testify on Benghazi attack
","A meme critical of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has recently been making the rounds on social media. The meme is headlined ""I’m not ready for Hillary"" -- a takeoff on the PAC that supported Clinton during the months leading up to her official announcement -- and proceeds to list five reasons to oppose the former secretary of state. In this article, we’ll check one of those claims -- that Clinton ""refuses to testify before Congress about what really happened at Benghazi where four Americans died."" As most readers will recall, on Sept. 11, 2012, Islamic extremists attacked U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, killing U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. Clinton was secretary of state at the time, and critics -- many of them Republicans -- have insisted there’s more to be learned about the attacks. However, the claim in the meme struck us as odd, since Clinton has already testified twice on Benghazi, both on Jan. 23, 2013. On that day, she testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the morning and before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the afternoon. In fact, this produced some memorable and widely replayed video when Clinton offered an exasperated comment in response to questioning by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. ""With all due respect,"" she said, ""the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator."" So the meme’s claim seems wrong on its face. We could not track down the meme’s creator, and we did not receive a response to an email sent to an author who wrote about it for a conservative website. There is a committee -- the House Select Committee on Benghazi chaired by Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. -- that’s still investigating the matter. The committee and Clinton have indeed had some trouble coming to an agreement about her appearance before the committee. But the bones of contention are primarily logistical, not because Clinton ""refuses to testify."" Quite the contrary: In a letter written to the committee on May 4, 2015, Clinton’s lawyer, David E. Kendall, made that clear. ""Please let me know what date the Secretary may appear before the Committee to publicly testify again about the attacks on the U.S. government facilities in Benghazi, and to answer questions the Committee may have about her email use at the same hearing -- whether that be during the week of May 18th or at a later date. On such a day, she will stay as long as necessary to answer the Committee's questions, but will not prolong the Committee's efforts further by appearing on two separate occasions when one will suffice,"" Kendall wrote. Committee Democrats said that Clinton had made clear as early as December 2014 that she was willing to testify before Gowdy’s panel. As it happened, May came and went without an appearance by Clinton, but the campaign said on July 25 that she would be appearing before the committee instead in October 2015. The two parties are still negotiating the final logistics. But differing over logistical negotiations are not the same thing as refusing to testify. The Benghazi panel itself acknowledged in a July 25 statement that the issue has not been whether Clinton would testify, but how. Citing Kendall’s letter, the panel noted that ""while insisting she would appear only a single time before the Committee, (he said) that Secretary Clinton would answer all questions the Committee had about Libya, Benghazi, and her unusual email arrangement with herself."" A past source of friction between the Clinton camp and the committee -- to what extent Clinton’s ""unusual email arrangement"" should be subject to questioning -- is smoothed over by now. The Clinton camp told PolitiFact that they are ""in agreement"" with the committee’s view that, as the committee put it in its statement, Clinton’s email arrangement ""falls within the scope of the Select Committee's jurisdiction."" Our ruling A social media meme says that Clinton ""refuses to testify before Congress about what really happened at Benghazi where four Americans died."" This makes no sense, since she has already testified twice, in public and on live television, about the Benghazi attack. Moreover, we find no evidence that Clinton has been opposed to testifying before Gowdy’s panel. What has kept her from testifying so far are disagreements between the two camps over scheduling and formatting -- not over whether she would testify or not. Any past disagreements about the scope of her testimony appear to have been resolved as of this writing.

Scott Walker says his last budget committed more to need-based financial aid than ever before
","In what read like an introduction to a campaign platform, Gov. Scott Walker outlined a series of potential presidential talking points in a June 8, 2015 op-ed published in the Quad-City Times, an Iowa newspaper. Among them: A line about making higher education more affordable for low-income families. ""Our last budget committed the highest level of need-based financial aid in state history,"" Walker wrote. Is he right on that point? Looking at the budget When Walker made the claim, the 2015-’17 budget was still being debated in Madison, so that means his ""last budget"" would refer to the one for 2013-’15. In Wisconsin, budgets are done in two-year cycles, with each of the fiscal years beginning July 1 and ending June 30. Funding for most programs is broken out on an annual basis, so the two years in a biennial budget will often receive different amounts. Complicating matters: the actual numbers for how much the state spent in a fiscal year are typically not final until the following October. Asked to back up his statement, Walker's office pointed to data from the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau that show the last budget spent $121,034,960 for need-based financial aid for 2013-’14. That is a larger number than any previous year, but it does not account for inflation. When earlier years are placed on the same inflationary scale, the data shows $370,000 more was spent on need-based financial aid in Fiscal Year 2011. That was part of the budget was passed in 2009, when Democrat Jim Doyle was still in office. But there is a second year in that ""last"" budget Walker referred to. Since the final numbers are not out yet, we don’t know exactly what was spent in 2014-’15, but we do know that budget set aside $121,263,400 for the program. That would be the most of any budget. When you combine the 2013-’14 actual amounts with the appropriated amounts for 2014-’15, the figures come out to about $8 million more for need-based financial aid than Doyle’s 2009-’2011 budget -- even when the numbers are adjusted for inflation. But there is a bit more to the story. Wisconsin Covenant In 2011-’12, the first year of Walker’s first state budget, funding for need-based financial aid decreased. Since then, the amount has increased every year. And some of the increased cost is due to a obligations from a program created under Doyle -- the Wisconsin Covenant -- that Walker discontinued. The Wisconsin Covenant program allowed an 8th grader to sign a pledge that he or she would maintain a B-average and graduate from high school. If the student did that -- and met several other requirements, including submitting a financial aid application -- he or she would get a scholarship of a varying amount. Students were first able to sign the covenant in 2007, when Doyle was still governor. In 2011, the first group of students were able to collect on that covenant, soon after Walker took office.   When Walker cancelled the program, those who already signed the pledge were to receive scholarship money if they remained eligible, but no new applicants could enter the program after September 2011. The Wisconsin Covenant accounted for nearly $8 million of the need-based financial aid total in 2013-’14. Meanwhile, it was expected to account for more than $10 million in 2014-’15. If the money to support the program were subtracted from Walker’s budget, Doyle’s budget would have given more to need-based financial aid than Walker’s. Our rating Walker said: ""Our last budget committed the highest level of need-based financial aid in state history."" That is accurate, even when sliced different ways. But it is the worth noting that the spending levels are boosted significantly by spending required from a program created by Doyle -- the Wisconsin Covenant -- that Walker ended.

Numbers back rosy jobs claim for Georgia
","Job creation was one of the main issues in Gov. Nathan Deal’s successful re-election bid last year, with wins from the state’s focus on recruiting automakers a key element of the talk. Years of effort paid off with big headlines when Porsche North America expanded its headquarters here. The headlines got bigger earlier this year when Mercedes-Benz announced metro Atlanta would become the new home of its U.S. headquarters. But in May, the tone of the big news changed when Volvo rejected Georgia and went with South Carolina for a new $500 million factory that will employ 4,000 workers. State leaders were disappointed but called it a speed bump, not a crash, and pledged to focus on other economic development projects. This month, Deal’s chief of staff, Chris Riley, repeated the point. Since the May 11 Volvo announcement, Riley said those other projects have brought more than $800 million in investments and the promise of 3,455 jobs. ""Sometimes the home runs look good,"" Riley said. ""But it’s the singles and doubles that really add up."" Mixed sports and driving metaphors aside, did Georgia really manage to bring in even more investment than the Volvo factory promised? We wanted to see the details. Riley was unavailable for comment, but a spokeswoman for Deal’s office said the governor’s top aide drew the numbers from the state’s Department of Economic Development. The agency is responsible for planning and mobilizing state incentives and other resources to attract new business and expand existing operations. The big pitches generate big numbers, in dollars and in jobs, and big headlines. With Mercedes-Benz, for instance, the state offered an incentives package worth $23.3 million. Taken with Fulton County’s property tax break worth $4 million for the next decade, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution calculated that package translated into incentives of $28,750 per job for the 950 total employees that will work in the new Sandy Springs headquarters. The smaller headlines, if they made news at all, were the smaller projects that Riley mentioned. The Economic Development Department keeps track of all of its work, though it only announces named projects when firms agree. Some expansions, for instance, are kept mum so competitors don’t learn of investments that put a firm at a disadvantage, department spokeswoman Stefanie Paupeck Harper said. But the department showed PolitiFact Georgia its tally, broken down by region and type of work when firm names are not released. Between May 11 and Riley’s statement, the department tallied 3,728 jobs – or 273 more than Riley claimed. Of that total, 300 came on the same day that Volvo spurned Georgia. Half of them are with an unnamed food processing expansion project in the 10-county region south and west of metro Atlanta. Named on the list: 100 manufacturing jobs coming with the expansion of MI Metals in Jenkins County; 100 software/tech jobs from Courion moving its headquarters from Massachusetts to Roswell; 200 automotive manufacturing jobs coming with German auto supplier NIFCO KTW’s construction of a plant in Toccoa; and 400 software jobs with the expansion of the Brazilian IT provider Stefanini in Atlanta. We found one error in the tally. The Economic Development Department counts 450 jobs with the relocation of Sage, a British software firm, while the official press releases list 400 jobs. Yet even without those 50 jobs, the tally grew to 3,871 jobs and $902 million in investment by the time we talked to Chris Carr, the state economic development commissioner, on July 23. Among the latest jobs: 120 positions (and $5.5 million in investment) with the relocation of the Dutch firm CSM Bakery Solutions to Sandy Springs. ""Obviously, we tried to be aggressive with Volvo, but we are aggressive with smaller companies, too, because with the different regions, the impact is seen all over Georgia,"" Carr said. ""It’s a fun thing to watch."" That means the data back up Riley's claim, with one notable caveat. All the projects must invest and hire as promised to receive the incentives, but the timelines vary based on the project, Carr said. None of those extend beyond about eight years, Carr said. But the different deals mean that Georgia has not added nearly twice as many jobs since March, when Volvo said it was going to South Carolina. Then again, it’s not as if Volvo has already set up shop in the Palmetto State and added those jobs. It has years to get to its promise, known in the paperwork as ""up to 4,000 jobs."" So, in that frame, it means Riley was comparing apples to apples when he made his claim. And the point, Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said, was clear. ""We all love the megadeals. They spread news about our state and our great business climate here,"" Robinson said. ""But the jobs that don’t make the headlines present just as much economic security and opportunity for some Georgians, somewhere,"" he added. ""Every Georgian has a stake in each one of these deals."" Our ruling State officials promised that Georgia’s momentum for attracting new business would not falter following the loss of a $500 million Volvo plant to rival South Carolina in May. Gov. Nathan Deal’s chief of staff said in July that smaller deals since the Volvo project have led to the promise of 3,455 jobs and $800 million in investment statewide. State economic development data show Chris Riley was low in his tally. Even with an error in the data, Georgia can count nearly as many jobs and significantly more in investment than was promised by Volvo.

Bill O'Reilly tells Huckabee: Russia, China 'said pretty clearly' they would not keep Iran sanctions
","The Obama administration says the proposed nuclear agreement with Iran is a significant improvement over the status quo. Critics say the opposite — that no deal would be better. A recent exchange between Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly and Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee pivots around this point. O’Reilly argued that the alternative to an agreement was war, which Huckabee dismissed as an Obama talking point. To Huckabee, the better play was to continue and strengthen economic sanctions on Iran, forcing them into a position of weakness. O’Reilly equally dismissed that idea. ""Russia and China told us if we had walked away from this deal that they were not going to obey the sanctions any longer,"" O’Reilly said. Huckabee said that wasn’t ""for sure."" But O’Reilly doubled down. ""They absolutely said pretty clearly,"" O’Reilly replied. Russia and China certainly could knock the teeth out of any economic sanctions if they pulled out. Did they signal those intentions to the United States? Conventional wisdom As part of the nuclear agreement, the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany agreed to phase out various economic sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy in exchange for concessions in Iran’s nuclear program. Lifting sanctions against Iran was a top concern for Russia, said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in April. ""In general, we are principled opponents of the use of methods of pressure in international relations, of restricting lawful rights of states in selfish, lucrative interests,"" Lavrov said. ""It is a short-sighted policy, which, as a rule, has a boomerang effect on its authors."" News articles cited by O'Reilly's staff highlight U.S. concern that if a deal was not reached, then some countries, including Russia, China and India, would no longer observe sanctions because they were not seen as a permanent solution. Experts share that view. ""It was unlikely the coalition supporting sanctions could have been kept together indefinitely to maintain pressure on Iran, and there was little appetite either domestically or internationally to use force to disable Iran’s nuclear program,"" said Francis Gavin, the Frank Stanton Professor in Nuclear Security Policy Studies in MIT’s Department of Political Science. Vipin Narang, an MIT associate professor of political science and author of Nuclear Strategy in the Modern Era, said, ""A more stringent sanctions regime would have been virtually impossible to construct and sustain."" Obama repeated these concerns in April. ""If it is perceived that we walked away from a fair deal that gives us assurances Iran doesn’t get a nuclear weapon, then those international sanctions will fray,"" he said. ""And it won’t just be Russia or China. It will be some of our close allies."" In fact, Russia and China were barely acknowledging sanctions as they were. The United States’ sanctions on Iran can be traced back to the 1979 hostage crisis, while sanctions by the United Nations go back to 2006. Additional sanctions have been placed on Iran since then by the United States, European Union and United Nations. Together, these sanctions affected Iran’s nuclear, missile, energy, shipping, transportation, and financial sectors, according to the Department of State website. The hope of these sanctions was to starve Iran of the resources it needed to proliferate its nuclear and missile programs, and encourage Iran to sit down for talks. Before the Iran deal was even struck, both Russia and China had already ignored some of the U.S. and E.U. sanctions. Based on their past actions, it is unlikely that either country would have had a sudden change of heart and supported continued sanctions against Iran if the deal had fallen through. Russian leaders have said they only recognize the U.N. Security Council sanctions. Richard Brennan, senior political scientist at the Rand Corporation, said even though he does not know of any explicit mention of Russia or China saying they would stop sanctions against Iran, O’Reilly’s ""meaning is accurate."" Records of sanctions against Iran compiled by the Jewish Virtual Library show that in spite of the sanctions, both Russia and China have profited from Iranian oil, and Russia has continued to sell weapons to Iran. Our ruling O’Reilly said that Russia and China ""absolutely said pretty clearly"" they would not keep economic sanctions on Iran if the United States ""walked away from the deal."" Russia and China certainly have given signals that they both wanted sanctions against Iran removed. Both Russia and China have a history of ignoring sanctions that have been placed on Iran. Experts say that if the United States, one of the strongest supporters of these sanctions, had abandoned the deal, then it is likely that China, Russia and possibly other countries would have disregarded these sanctions. O'Reilly is pushing the envelope when he said ""absolutely"" clear, as they haven't issued formal statements. But all of their actions indicate that what O'Reilly said is substantially accurate. We rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jul/30/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-tells-huckabee-russia-china-said-clea/

Former NYPD detective on Sandra Bland's traffic stop: 'The law says' do what officer says
","Dashboard camera footage of the traffic stop of Sandra Bland spurred contentious, if not always accurate, cable news debate about a person’s rights when dealing with law enforcement. Bland, a 28-year-old woman from Chicago, was found dead in her jail cell three days after Texas state trooper Brian Encinia stopped her for failing to signal when changing lanes (she was ultimately charged with resisting arrest). Questions still surround her death, which officials called a suicide. But the video gives Americans a clearer look at the explosive start of the arrest that put her behind bars to begin with. The director of the Texas Department of Public Safety criticized Encinia’s actions, saying that the trooper violated arrest procedure. But some people are also questioning Bland’s behavior, including her refusal to put out her cigarette at Encinia’s request. Don Lemon led a CNN Tonight panel on July 21 about the ordeal with legal analyst Sunny Hostin, liberal pundit Marc Lamont Hill and retired New York Police Department detective Harry Houck. Most of the panel agreed with Hostin’s advice for dealing with law enforcement: Essentially, make the encounter as short as possible by obeying orders and dealing with legal issues or mistreatment later. Lemon then asked Houck to clarify the legal rights that people actually have during a police stop — and that’s where the discussion got murky. Lemon asked if all the attention on this encounter and others around the country ""is giving people a false sense of rights that they have, that they really don’t have?"" Yes, Houck responded. ""People actually think, that I've talked to, saying that, no, if a police officer stopped me for something, I don't think he's stopping me for a right reason, but I don't have to cooperate with the officer. But that is wrong,"" he said. Houck continued: ""The law says, just like you said, Don, that when a police officer stops you, do whatever he says and then deal with it later."" Read literally, Houck’s statement seems to give law enforcement a lot of leeway during stops. Are civilians really required to obey their each and every order? The video Before we dive into the legal issues underlying Bland’s arrest, let’s review what the video shows. Encinia pulls Bland over for a failure to signal as she changed lanes. Encinia retrieves Bland’s driver’s license and insurance and heads back to his car. After four and a half minutes, Encinia returns to issue a ticket to Bland. At the window, he asks her if she’s okay. ""I’m waiting on you, this is your job,"" she says. ""You seem very irritated,"" he tells her. ""I really am,"" Bland replies, explaining why she’s unhappy that she was pulled over. Encinia asks if she’s done speaking, then asks her to put out her cigarette. Bland refuses, saying that she’s free to smoke a cigarette in her own car. Encinia then directs her out of the car, calling it a ""lawful order."" When she doesn’t move, he opens the door and forcibly removes her, pointing a Taser in her direction and threatening to ""light her up."" After Bland exits the car, Encinia issues a number of orders, including for her to put her phone down, to ""come over here,"" to ""stand right here,"" and to ""turn around."" The confrontation becomes physical shortly afterwards, before Encinia puts Bland in the back of his squad car. The panelists were divided on the issue of whether Bland escalated the situation by claiming rights she did not have when she refused Encinia’s order to put out her cigarette. Experts we consulted said Bland had the right to act the way she did, but Encinia may have, too. Here’s why. Pleading the Fifth (and the Fourth) Does the law really say you have to do whatever a police officer says during a traffic stop? Literally, no. The Constitution affords a few fundamental rights to everyone stopped or arrested by law enforcement in the United States. The right to refuse a search of one’s person, car or home is guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, and the right to remain silent is protected by the Fifth. No matter how much information Encinia wanted to get out of Bland, she was not legally obliged to provide it. ""You definitely don’t have to answer questions,"" said Robert Weisberg, a Stanford University law professor who specializes in criminal justice and procedure. So Houck’s statement doesn’t hold up under constitutional scrutiny. When reached for comment, Houck said his comments were being taken too literally, adding he only meant that civilians were obligated to comply with orders ""within reason."" ""Anybody with common sense knows what I said,"" he said. Houck told PunditFact that he had been focusing primarily on the legality of Encinia’s order for Bland to exit her car, a point he brings up early on in the panel discussion but doesn’t stress throughout. In the interview, he brought up Pennsylvania vs. Mimms, a Supreme Court case from 1977 in which two implicated law enforcement officers were found not to have violated the Fourth Amendment when directing a man to exit his car upon stopping him for a traffic violation. He argued that the precedent established in Mimms applies to Bland’s arrest as well. Reasonable suspicion Houck does have a point that officers have a considerable amount of authority over a person during a traffic stop. In Mimms, after directing a man out of his car, officers noticed a bulge under the man’s jacket. The bulge turned out to be a loaded gun, and the man was then arrested. The court ruled that exiting one’s car for the duration of a stop did not violate a person's Fourth Amendment rights. So Encinia, using Mimms as jurisprudence, had the right to direct Bland out of her car, even if he had no reason to suspect that she was armed or dangerous. Some have argued, however, that because the ""legal stop"" was finished by the time Encinia directed Bland out the car, he did not have the right to continue the interaction. But the broader point that Houck misses in his explanation is that much of an officer’s authority to search or use force or a person is permissible only if they have reason to suspect that the person is armed or dangerous, or has committed a crime. What exactly constitutes ""reasonable suspicion"" is still up for for debate. Weisberg emphasized how gray this area of law still is. A non-answer, for example, can often be interpreted by law enforcement as ""furtive behavior,"" thus authorizing many options an officer might not have otherwise had, including searching, moving, or using force on a subject, Weisberg said. Making these judgment calls is where officers have the most leeway, said Jason Williamson, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who recently wrote a Bland-inspired article for Time entitled ""What to Do if You Get Pulled Over by a Cop."" ""It’s certainly true that cops are given discretion and the benefit of the doubt,"" Williamson said. In order for Encinia to argue that he was suspicious of Bland, he would have to point to her refusal to put out her cigarette as an indication of violent intentions, said Jody David Armour, a  University of Southern California law professor. ""That is a judgment of intent,"" he said, ""and a judgment of character."" Our ruling Houck claimed that ""the law says … that when a police officer stops you, do whatever he says"" during a stop. Reasonable suspicion justifies an officer’s increased authority during a stop or an arrest, though the definition of ""reasonable"" is often unclear. Applied generally, however, the claim is incorrect. Even though it might be advisable to defer to law enforcement in many cases, the Constitution protects one’s right to remain silent and to not consent to a search. Without suspicion that the subject is armed or has committed a crime, an officer must respect these rights. That's what the law says. We rate Houck's claim False. Correction: This item was updated on July 31 to correct the sequence of events in describing Pennsylvania vs. Mimms. In that case, the Supreme Court found that the act of ordering a person out of a car for the duration of a stop, even in the absence of reasonable suspicion, is constitutional.",/factchecks/2015/jul/30/harry-houck/former-nypd-detective-sandra-blands-traffic-stop-l/

Meme claims Obama to ban Social Security recipients from owning guns
","After the shooting in Charleston, S.C., that left nine African-American worshippers dead, President Barack Obama made it clear where he directs the blame. ""Every country has violent, hateful, or mentally unstable people,"" Obama said. ""What’s different is not every country is awash with easily accessible guns."" Though efforts to enact comprehensive gun control legislation through Congress withered amid intense opposition from gun rights supporters, Obama has done what he can to use executive orders to curb access to guns. One potential policy for his administration would have the Social Security Administration share information with the national background check system that is used to conduct background checks of gun purchasers. Adding names from the Social Security list would potentially increase the number of people barred from purchasing a gun. After this possibility emerged, gun-rights advocates reacted quickly and aggressively. ""SPREAD THIS: Obama Makes Huge Move to BAN Social Security Recipients From Owning Guns,"" read the headline in the Conservative Tribune. Breitbart, another conservative website, declared: ""Obama’s Secret Plan to Block Seniors on Social Security from Owning Guns."" Other websites qualified their message by referring to ""some Social Security recipients,"" and some cited a specific figure -- 4.2 million -- as the number of people that would be unable to own guns. We were curious to see how all these claims stacked up, so we dug into the evidence. The background check system Under existing federal law, several factors can prevent someone from buying a gun. Most of these have to do with law enforcement issues, such as a prior felony conviction or a record of domestic abuse. Mental-health issues can be another factor, such as involuntary commitment to a mental institution. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, is supposed to streamline the process of gun purchasing by quickly weeding out those who cannot legally buy a gun. In 36 states or territories, the FBI performs all background checks, whereas the remaining 25 states set up their own state agencies to either conduct full or partial background checks. But such a system is only as good as the databases it’s linked to -- and several analyses have shown that these databases are far from complete. If someone is ineligible to purchase a gun but their information didn’t get into the right database, then the background check won’t stop the purchase. For instance, suspected Charleston shooter Dylann Roof should have been ineligible to buy a gun because of a prior felony on a drug charge, but errors in paperwork, and a mistake by the FBI examiner in charge of the background check, meant that Roof passed the check. The Los Angeles Times article The source that every site we found linked back to was a July 18 Los Angeles Times article, headlined, ""Obama pushes to extend gun background checks to Social Security."" The article reports that the Social Security Administration is crafting a new policy that would prevent gun purchases by certain types of beneficiaries. The ineligible beneficiaries would be those who were deemed mentally incompetent. In this instance, a mentally incompetent person would be categorized as someone who has their finances handled by another party, known as a ""representative payee."" The Social Security change did not emerge suddenly. It stems from an executive order by Obama in January 2013 that required ""require federal agencies to make data available to the federal background check system."" The idea behind the executive order was to make the background check database more complete and prevent gun purchases by people who, under the law, are ineligible. We found several problems with the websites’ claims. • The new policy would not ban all Social Security recipients from owning guns. Rather, it would only affect the small fraction who are deemed mentally incompetent, and who are thus are barred from purchasing guns under the law. • The policy is not yet in force. When we reached out to the Social Security Administration, a spokesman responded, ""We are still developing our policy."" In developing the plan, the Social Security Administration is following the lead of another federal agency, the Veterans Administration, which is already sharing names with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The Social Security Administration’s policy is expected to be similar. • The policy would not take away guns from people who already own them. There is no indication that this policy would take guns away from people who already own guns. Rather, the policy would affect the ability of some mentally incompetent people from buying new guns. ""There is nothing in the policy that would change the definition of who may possess a gun, nor anything that extends the federal government’s authority to take guns away from those who already have them,"" said Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University. There is one exception to this: California currently tracks and disarms ineligible gun owners. In addition to seizing the guns of those people determined to be mentally unstable, California law enforcement also disarms people with felonies or a domestic violence restraining order. The new policy, once it’s instituted, could marginally increase the number of mentally incompetent individuals living in California who are disarmed under that 2013 law. What about the charge that 4.2 million people would be affected by the policy? There’s some truth to it, but there’s an important caveat: 2.7 million of the beneficiaries who have their finances managed by others receive Social Security because of a mental disability, not just because of their age, according to LaVenia LaVelle, a spokeswoman for the Social Security Administration. So it’s not really accurate to say, as Breitbart did, that the plan is ""to block seniors"" from buying guns, since a large number of those affected would not be seniors. Data from December 2013 shows that about 1.2 million disabled workers with mental disorders who were receiving Social Security disability were under 50.  Finally, some of these people may already be in the database for another reason.  Our ruling Bloggers such as the Conservative Tribune wrote headlines like this one: ""SPREAD THIS: Obama Makes Huge Move to BAN Social Security Recipients From Owning Guns."" This is a vast exaggeration of the actual policy under consideration. It would not affect all Social Security recipients, but rather those who have already been declared mentally incompetent, and thus ineligible under current law from purchasing a gun. And it is targeted at blocking gun purchases, not taking away guns from people who already have them. Only in California could the policy lead to increased gun seizures, and only -- potentially -- for mentally incompetent residents of the state who would be newly added to the background check database.  Obama has not made a sweeping move to disarm gun-owning senior citizens, as these websites claim. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2015/jul/30/blog-posting/websites-say-obama-policy-change-means-seniors-gun/

100,000 pro-union protesters were shipped into Wisconsin, Scott Walker says
","Pitching his qualifications for president, Gov. Scott Walker often cites how he faced 100,000 protesters who fought unsuccessfully to stop  Act 10, the 2011 collective bargaining reform law that led to his historic recall election. But sometimes the Wisconsin Republican goes further — suggesting that the throngs of pro-union demonstrators had been imported. That's what happened July 27, 2015, when Fox News talk show host Neil Cavuto asked Walker what he thought about a commentary by syndicated Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank. In the column, Milbank said Walker has a ""technique of scapegoating unions for the nation’s ills"" that is similar to techniques of the late Joe McCarthy, the Communist-hunting U.S. senator from Wisconsin. Walker began his response to Cavuto by saying: ""Well, in the end, I’m used to -- you know, you’ve been up to Wisconsin, you’ve seen it firsthand. The big-government special interests, the powerful special interests, the union bosses and others, they will stop at nothing, and all their supporters out there. They brought 100,000 protesters into our state to try and intimidate us, to back us down."" We’ve been here before. In late February 2011, during the heat of the daily protests inside and around the Capitol, Walker said ""almost all"" of the protesters were from outside of Wisconsin. He made the statement in a phone conversation with a Buffalo, New York, blogger who was posing as industrialist and conservative political donor David Koch. We rated Walker’s statement False. There were people taking buses to Madison from Illinois, and no doubt some protesters came from other states. But we found no evidence that the vast majority of demonstrators came from outside of Wisconsin. Indeed, there was criticism of the number of public employees in Wisconsin who took off work to participate in the rallies. On Feb. 18, 2011, some schools around the state shut down because so many teachers heeded the call of their union leaders to descend upon Madison. Fast forward to today. We asked Walker’s campaign for evidence that 100,000 protesters were brought into Wisconsin. The campaign cited isolated reports of demonstrators being bused in from Illinois and New York, but nothing more comprehensive. For the record, it’s clear tens of thousands of protesters participated in some of the daily demonstrations, but less clear whether the crowds ever reached 100,000. In their book ""More Than They Bargained For: Scott Walker, Unions and the Fight for Wisconsin,"" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporters Jason Stein and Patrick Marley noted that on Feb. 19, 2011, thousands of tea party backers joined the protesters in order to show support for Walker. Madison police estimated the overall crowd that day, a Saturday, at 68,000. The crowd the following Saturday was estimated at 70,000, ""definitely one of the largest and most sustained demonstrations we've ever seen,"" a Madison police spokesman told reporters at the time. He said the total could have been as high as 100,000, but counting was difficult because the demonstration was spread over a large area surrounding the Capitol Square. Madison police officer Kim Alan told us that some busloads of union supporters made no secret of the fact that they had come from out of state. But she said her department did not attempt to discern what portion of the protesters overall were from outside of Wisconsin. Our rating Walker said his political opponents ""brought 100,000 protesters into our state."" In early 2011, tens of thousands of protesters — and perhaps as many as 100,000 on some days — participated in daily demonstrations near the state Capitol to protest Walker’s collective bargaining reform law. But there is no evidence to indicate that all or nearly all were from outside of Wisconsin. We rate Walker’s statement False.

"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Rubio says 40% of illegal immigrants stayed in the U.S. after their visas expired
","Sen. Marco Rubio said that while people sneaking into the United States is a legitimate problem, the immigration system is so broken that almost half of all illegal immigrants came into the country through legal channels. ""We have a porous border, meaning not just the border with Mexico, but 40 percent of people in this country, illegally, are overstaying visas,"" he said on Fox & Friends on July 22, 2015. If that’s a stat that sounds familiar, it’s because Rubio has said it before -- including during his 2010 Senate campaign. Former Gov. Jeb Bush has cited the number, too. But is it true that 40 percent of illegal immigrants are people who have overstayed their visas? It turns out that we hear the figure so often because it’s the most commonly accepted estimate, although it’s getting a little long in the tooth. An old problem We didn’t hear back from Rubio’s office when we tried to contact them, but in all likelihood he was referring to a calculation done by the Pew Research Center, an independent ""fact tank"" that doesn’t take policy positions. In a 2006 report, Pew estimated that ""nearly half of all the unauthorized migrants now living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport or a border crossing point where they were subject to inspection by immigration officials."" While the source data gave an estimate that ranged from 33 percent to 50 percent, the report went middle-of-the-road and called it 45 percent. That report relied on a 1997 study from the Immigration and Naturalization Service. While trying to ascertain how many immigrants arrived and departed, INS concluded that in 1996, 41 percent of illegal immigrants had entered the United States legally. Robert Warren, a former INS demographer whose work was a part of that 1997 report, told PolitiFact that immigration trends had changed over the years. Since 2008, there are more immigrants overstaying their visas than crossing the border illegally, but there are fewer illegal immigrants in the country overall. The generally agreed upon total of illegal immigrants in the United States now is about 11 million, down from a high of 12 million in 2007. But Warren, currently a fellow at the nonpartisan Center for Migration Studies, said the percentage of all overstays ""had been consistent over the past 30 years."" Most people crossing the border illegally come from about a half-dozen countries, especially Mexico, he said. Unauthorized immigrants from all other countries are almost all overstays. There have been other estimates of overstays: In January 2003, INS released an updated report that said 33 percent of the illegal immigrant population in 2000 had entered the country legally. A 2004 report from the General Accounting Office, based on 2000 data, gave estimates on visa overstays ranging from 27 percent  to 31 percent to 57 percent.   But no one has truly updated those estimates since then, mostly because there is no data available from which to draw new conclusions, the Migration Policy Institute’s Marc Rosenblum said. He said Homeland Security developed a methodology for estimating visa overstayers among people traveling by air and sea, but doesn’t have an official way to count people entering by land. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman confirmed to us that they have not recently released statistics on the number of overstays. Rosenblum said for now the old estimates are the best ones available. Homeland Security has promised Congress it would compile new data, he said, but no results have been made public. Until then, there’s no research that would truly dispute Rubio’s claim. ""The short answer is that no reliable estimate has been published since the Pew study,"" Rosenblum said. Our ruling Rubio said ""40 percent of people in this country, illegally, are overstaying visas."" This widely cited statistic is an estimate based on research that has roots going back to the 1990s. But because federal agencies haven’t provided new data, there’s little for analysts to use to provide an updated figure. Experts (including the demographer who created the initial estimate) told us that while illegal immigration trends have changed over the years, 40 percent can still be considered an acceptable estimate.

The majority of the Hispanic population is U.S.-born, says José Diaz-Balart
","Donald Trump’s immigration views may be divisive among candidates vying for the GOP presidential nomination, but the bombastic billionaire remains at the top of the polls. Former presidential candidate and conservative pundit Pat Buchanan credits Trump’s rise in part to his willingness to address one of the country’s hottest issues. Appearing July 26 on NBC’s Meet the Press, Buchanan said people are feeling the ""conquest of the West by massive third-world immigrations coming from refugees and border jumpers and all the rest of them."" José Díaz-Balart, host of MSNBC's The Rundown with José Díaz-Balart and a Telemundo anchor, challenged Buchanan’s comments during the show’s panel discussion with some food for thought. ""The invasion is from within,"" Díaz-Balart said. ""The majority of the Hispanic population and the growth is U.S.-born."" He added, ""Sprinkle that on your oatmeal, or probably on your huevos rancheros."" We wanted to check his points: Are most Hispanics in the United States born here? And do U.S. births account for the majority of the growth in the Hispanic population? The answer to both questions is yes. U.S. Census Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein directed us to the latest information available from the American FactFinder. There were about 54 million Hispanics in the United States in 2013. Of this number, about 32.9 million were born in one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia, which works out to 61 percent of the overall Hispanic population. Another 2.1 million are considered native to the United States, meaning they were born in Puerto Rico, abroad to American citizens or on a U.S. military base. Adding in this group brings the share of U.S.-born Hispanics to 65 percent. Either way you read it, Diaz-Balart’s point stands. The trend holds when measuring the Hispanic population’s growth from July 2013 to July 2014. Over the course of the year, the Hispanic population increased by about 1.2 million. The natural increase (which refers to the number of domestic births minus the number of deaths) accounts for about 73 percent of this 1.2 million population jump. An additional note: These numbers include both documented and undocumented Hispanics. According to Bernstein, the U.S. Census Bureau does not ask about an individual’s legal status, so these specific divisions cannot be determined.

Bernie Sanders, in Madison, claims top 0.1% of Americans have almost as much wealth as bottom 90%
","A month after launching his long-shot bid for the White House, a 73-year-old senator from Vermont appeared in Madison before perhaps the largest gathering for any candidate to that point in the 2016 campaign. Bernie Sanders called for a political revolution against greed and took jabs at Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a contender on the GOP side of the field. Cheering him on was an Alliant Energy Center crowd that his aides estimated at  nearly 10,000 people. At one point during his hourlong speech on July 1, 2015, Sanders said: ""The issue of wealth and income inequality, to my mind, is the great moral issue of our time. It is the great economic issue of our time and it is the great political issue of our time. ""Let me be as clear as I can be: There is something profoundly wrong when today, the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent."" Wealth inequality is sure to be an issue Sanders emphasizes as he challenges Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. So, does the top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent? Previous claims Two of our most-clicked fact checks have found significant gaps in wealth in the United States. Filmmaker Michael Moore -- also speaking in Madison, during the height of protests against Walker over his collective bargaining reforms in 2011 -- said 400 Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans combined. Our rating was True. As of 2010, the net worth of the Forbes 400 -- $1.37 trillion -- exceeded that of the poorest 60 percent of U.S. households. We also rated True a 2013 statement by the liberal One Wisconsin Now advocacy group, which said the wealth of the Wal-Mart Walton family equalled the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined. The wealth of Sam Walton’s heirs, we found, was $89.5 billion -- equal to the bottom 42 percent of American families.   A note about those fact checks, in terms of helping explain the wealth gap: Many Americans make a good income, have some savings and investments, and own a nice home; they also have debt, for a mortgage, credit cards and other bills. Some people would still have a pretty healthy bottom line, but still have a negative net worth. Meanwhile, so far in 2015, PolitiFact National has given Sanders a Mostly True for saying income equality in the U.S. is the widest since the 1920s; and a Mostly True for saying 99 percent of all new income is ""going to the top 1 percent."" Now to his new claim, which is about wealth, rather than income. Sanders’ evidence To back Sanders’ statement, his Senate office cited a news article from The Guardian newspaper. The headline on the article, which reported on a wealth inequality study released in October 2014, matched Sanders’ claim nearly word for word. The study was done for the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonpartisan organization in Cambridge, Mass. It is perhaps best known as the arbiter for determining whether the U.S. economy is in recession. The authors of the study were economists Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, and Gabriel Zucman of the London School of Economics. Using tax records, they made estimates for 2012 on wealth -- that is, the value of all assets, such as a home, and savings and retirement accounts, minus all debts, such as mortgages and credit card balances. The major finding, in terms of Sanders’ claim: The top 0.1 percent was composed of 160,000 families with average wealth of $72.8 million. All told, they owned 22 percent of the nation’s wealth. Meanwhile, the bottom 90 percent -- 144 million families with average wealth of $84,000 -- owned only 22.8 percent of the wealth. In other words, the top 0.1 percent and the bottom 90 percent of U.S. households own virtually the same share of all the nation's wealth. ""Wealth is getting more concentrated in the United States,"" the researchers observed, ""but this phenomenon largely owes to the spectacular dynamics of fortunes of dozens and hundreds of million dollars, and much less to the growth in fortunes of a few million dollars. Inequality within rich families is increasing."" Two other prominent economists -- Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics and Edward Wolff of New York University -- told us that the study makes solid estimates about wealth inequality. Wolff said he was not aware of another study that examined the wealth of the top 0.1 percent. But some fault the findings to some degree. Another view Richard Burkhauser, a professor of policy analysis at Cornell University, told us that Saez and Zucman are ""very well respected economists,"" but that he has a major complaint about their study: it excludes Social Security. ""To ignore it as they do grossly understates the wealth held by Americans in the bottom 99 percent of the population,""  Burkhauser said. Another criticism is the study that it doesn't take into account changes in tax laws. Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, pointed us to an article one of his colleagues wrote in the Wall Street Journal. It said, for example, that changes in tax laws in the 1980s and ’90s skew any increase in wealth inequality by requiring more capital income of high-income taxpayers be reported on individual returns, while excluding most capital income of middle-income savers and homeowners. Mitchell told us: ""Even if one makes the heroic assumption that the data is completely accurate, our friends on the left take these numbers and want people to believe that the wealth of the top 1 percent (or top 10 percent, or top .01 percent, etc) comes at the expense of the rest of us. This is generally nonsense. People such as Bill Gates become rich because they generate real value for others. There is no fixed pie."" Our rating Sanders said ""the top one-tenth of 1 percent"" of Americans ""own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.""

House GOP attacked for passing 'bill that makes it legal' to fire single moms
","A meme shared by the liberal Facebook group Occupy Democrats calls out Republicans for an alarming affront to women. ""House Republicans just passed a bill that makes it legal for single mothers to be fired by their employers,"" it says. The meme was shared more than 60,000 times, suggesting a lot of people found the news outrageous. We wanted to know if the meme is accurate: Did House Republicans really pass a bill that makes it legal for single moms to be fired by their employers? The outrage, we found, is overblown. No bill was passed It’s clear from a cached image of Occupy Democrats’ website and a Huffington Post article that the meme’s underlying beef is with the First Amendment Defense Act, HR 2802, introduced by Republicans on June 17. The bill, co-sponsored by U.S. Rep. Raúl Labrador, R-Idaho, and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, is a conservative response to the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize gay marriage. Before we get into the bill’s language and possibly worrisome interpretations, we want to make one thing clear: This bill has not passed the GOP-led House. Far from it.The bill has been submitted to a committee for consideration. But it has not been debated, much less voted on, in committee or on the House floor. The Senate has also not moved on its companion.  This, of course, doesn’t preclude either chamber from getting around to it. But to say the bill has been passed is just wrong. Only about 15 percent of bills make it past the committee stage, according to GovTrack.us. With that out of the way, we’ll explain why some advocates for women are concerned about its wording. What the bill actually says  Some Americans saw the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize gay marriage as a potential affront to their religious beliefs under the First Amendment. The authors of the First Amendment Defense Act attempted to address how the court’s decision could affect religious institutions in a situation that came up during oral arguments. Justice Samuel Alito asked in April whether a religious school could lose its tax-exempt status if it opposes same-sex marriage, and the U.S. solicitor general, who was arguing for same-sex couples, said ""it’s certainly going to be an issue."" The First Amendment Defense Act mentions this exchange in its text and proposes that it should be illegal for the federal government to impose tax, grant or benefit sanctions on organizations that oppose same-sex marriage because of religious or moral convictions. The bill does not mention women at all. So where does the concern for single moms losing their jobs come into play? The part that worries some people is section 3(a), which reads: ""Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Federal Government shall not take any discriminatory action against a person wholly or partially on the basis that such person believes or acts in accordance with a religious belief of moral conviction that marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage."" Emily Martin, vice president and general counsel of the National Women's Law Center, pointed to the last part about sexual relations being reserved for the marriage of one man and one woman.  The wording ""can absolutely"" be applied to women who are pregnant outside of marriage, she said. The introductory clause ""notwithstanding any other provision of law,"" Martin said, seems to indicate that FADA would overrule other existing laws on this issue. Usually, when an individual feels she has been discriminated against, she has to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The agency would then investigate the concern and give a ruling or provide the complainant with a ""right to sue."" However, Martin argued that, in an extreme scenario, it’s possible the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission would not have jurisdiction in cases under this bill since the First Amendment Defense Act specifically forbids the federal government from taking discriminatory actions against a person. (EEOC spokesman James Ryan said that the agency does not comment on pending legislation in Congress.) Samuel Estreicher, director of the Center for Labor and Employment Law at New York University’s Law School, says he would not read the bill as repealing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (which protects against sex discrimination). Still, he said it could use some clarification. "" ‘Acting in accordance with religious belief’ goes too far as a basis for protection,"" Estreicher said. ""People can do bad things in accordance with their religious belief. … There needs to be better definition of the protected acts.""   PunditFact reached out to Occupy Democrats but did not hear back. What the bill’s sponsors say The bill’s primary sponsors in the Senate and the House say the bill is not supposed to target single mothers. This accusation resonates with Labrador personally because he was raised by a single mother. In a phone interview, Labrador said the First Amendment Defense Act deals exclusively with possible federal government actions against employers that do not support same-sex marriage. The federal government would not be able to use tax or other federal sanctions, such as withdrawing benefits or tax-exempt status, against employers who oppose same-sex marriage. Further, he said, the bill does not address employer-employee relationships, and if an employee felt that she was discriminated against, she would still be able to seek recourse through employment protections in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. That said, Labrador said he would make the bill more clear by defining which government actions would be considered discriminatory against institutions that oppose same-sex marriage. One part of the law (Clause 3(b)(5), to be specific) might be read as a catch-all for federal discrimination, so Labrador said he will take it out. ""While (the possible firing of pregnant single mothers) was never an intended result of this legislation, we are taking these concerns seriously and working on tightening the language to ensure that the intent of the bill is clear,"" Labrador’s office said in a written statement. As of July 28, the bill had not been amended by the committee. Amendments can be introduced either by a committee or during debate in the House or Senate. Our ruling The Occupy Democrats’ meme said, ""House Republicans just passed a bill that makes it legal for single mothers to be fired by their employers."" There are big flaws with this claim: The bill in question has not been debated in the House or Senate, let alone passed under any definition of the word. It has merely been introduced.  Further, the bill does not legalize the firing of single mothers. The bill deals with discriminatory actions that the federal government could take (such as tax sanctions) against religious institutions that oppose same-sex marriage. The meme scares Facebook users about an outrageous House Republican move that did not occur. So we rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2015/jul/28/occupy-democrats/house-republicans-attacked-passing-bill-makes-it-l/

Donald Trump wrongly says the number of illegal immigrants is 30 million or higher
","The day after Donald Trump visited the border in Laredo, Texas, he was armed with some fresh claims about illegal immigration, including how many immigrants are actually here. ""I don't think the 11 million -- which is a number you have been hearing for many many years, I've been hearing that number for five years -- I don't think that is an accurate number anymore,"" Trump said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe July 24. ""I am now hearing it's 30 million, it could be 34 million, which is a much bigger problem."" Host Joe Scarborough then asked Trump, ""Who are you hearing that from?"" Trump replied: ""I am hearing it from other people, and I have seen it written in various newspapers. The truth is the government has no idea how many illegals are here."" Is Trump right that there are 30 million or more illegal immigrants? We decided to see what the latest evidence shows. Counting illegal immigrants The U.S. Department of Homeland Security comes up with an estimate of the number of illegal immigrants each year, and its most recent estimate was 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants as of January 2012. That includes those who entered the United States illegally and those who overstayed their visas. According to the department’s estimates, the number of illegal immigrants peaked around 12 million in 2007 and has gradually declined to closer to 11 million. The Homeland Security figure is in the same ballpark as several independent organizations that study illegal immigration, including Pew Research Center (11.3 million); the Center for Migration Studies (11 million), which studies migration and promotes policies that safeguard the rights of migrants, and the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of legal immigration (11-12 million). All of them arrive at their figures by subtracting known legal immigrants from the total number of foreign-born people documented in the U.S. census and then controlling for the estimated percentage of unauthorized immigrants who refuse to answer the census. All of the researchers we interviewed found similar figures to the federal government and said that Trump’s claim was wildly inflated. ""There are, to my knowledge, no credible, research-based estimates of 30 million,"" said Jeffrey Passel, an expert on Hispanic immigration at the Pew Research Center. ""The 11-12 million range is broadly accepted by almost all researchers and immigration advocates (regardless of perspective)."" Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, said that the total number of illegal immigrants has essentially held constant in recent years, because the number arriving has roughly balanced the number going home or getting legal status. Could the census be missing enough illegal immigrants in its counts that the estimate is actually in Trump’s range? The experts we talked with said no. ""Even though the empirical estimates have a margin of error of maybe plus or minus a million, there is virtually no evidence that the real number could be even a few million higher than 11 million,"" said Robert Warren, a fellow at the Center for Migration Studies and a former demographer with the Census Bureau and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Camarota said that the reason the 30 million figure is unlikely is that the census asks other questions that allow researchers to estimate how good the data is -- for example, the number of births to immigrant mothers, school enrollment and death records, which helps shore up the figure. In other words, if there were three times the generally accepted number of illegal immigrants in the United States, they would show up in those other categories. Marc Rosenblum of the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that doesn’t take positions on immigration legislation, said that 30 million ""is a totally absurd number."" ""There is NO published report by a serious research organization or academic that suggests anything in the range of 30 million,"" he said. So how did Trump come up with his inflated figure? We aren’t certain, since a campaign spokeswoman declined to comment. But we’ve heard others cite similar figures. In her book Adios America, conservative columnist Ann Coulter said there are 30 million illegal immigrants. Her starting point was a 2005 article from two Bear Stearns financial advisors, who looked at the rise in money sent back to Mexico and housing permits in three New Jersey communities. Coulter emphasized that ""the assumption that illegal people will fill out a census form is the most ridiculous concept I have ever heard of."" The Center for Immigration Studies disagrees with that last point. In a recent report, the center wrote, ""It is well established that illegal aliens do respond to government surveys such as the decennial census and the Current Population Survey."" Our ruling Trump said the number of illegal immigrants in the United States is ""30 million, it could be 34 million."" The Department of Homeland Security says the number of illegal immigrants was about 11.4 million as of January 2012. Other independent groups that research illegal immigration put the number between 11 and 12 million. We found no compelling evidence that the number could as high as Trump said. Trump has provided no proof that the number of illegal immigrants is triple the widespread consensus. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2015/jul/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-number-illegal-immigrants-30-mil/

More than half of California drivers' licenses went to undocumented immigrants, NumbersUSA says
","California is home to more undocumented immigrants than any other state, over 3 million, so any policy shift it makes is bound to catch attention. NumbersUSA, a group that favors reduced immigration, noticed a trend with driver’s licenses in the Golden State and posted a meme with this message on its Facebook page. ""More than half of all drivers' licenses issued in California this year have gone to illegal aliens,"" the meme says. The group is on solid ground with its numbers, although it omits why this has happened. According to the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles, about 397,000 undocumented immigrants received a driver’s license since January. ""This figure represents more than half of the total 759,000 original driver licenses that have distributed during the first half of 2015,"" the department said in a press release. Behind these numbers is a 2013 law called the Safe and Responsible Driver Act. The measure reversed a 20-year-old law that blocked people without legal status from applying for a license. A large coalition of immigrant advocacy organizations argued that in the state that epitomizes American car culture, that ban made it difficult for people to get to work, drive their kids to school and run simple errands. The result, the advocates argued, was thousands of people on the road without licenses and without any way to make sure they knew how to drive. Under AB 60, all that would be needed to get a license was proof of residency and the ability to pass a driver’s test, both written and on-the-road. California Gov. Jerry Brown signed the bill in October 2013. It took effect January 2015. A wave bigger than expected State officials predicted that about 500,000 people would apply in the first six months, with about another million people after three years. By April 2015, they had already hit the 500,000 mark. ""The interest in this program is far greater than anyone anticipated,"" said DMV director Jean Shiomoto in a press release. Shiomoto might have been surprised, but the state had done a lot to make this happen. In January 2014, Brown proposed spending $65 million to open five temporary offices and hire as many as 1,000 additional staffers to handle an application surge. He largely got what he wanted. The department opened four new offices and hired 900 people. In November 2014, the Department of Motor Vehicles announced it would keep longer office hours and stay open on Saturdays. ""DMV is committed to successfully implementing this new law to increase safety on California roads by putting licensed drivers behind the steering wheel,"" Shiomoto said. Our ruling The group NumbersUSA said that this year, more than half of all drivers' licenses issued in California went to undocumented immigrants. By the state’s own tally, that is correct. What the group doesn’t mention is that this is the result of a substantial state effort. First, lawmakers made it possible for over a million unauthorized residents to apply for a license, and then the state spent millions of dollars to speed the application process. The statement had the right numbers but needs additional information. We rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jul/28/numbers-usa/did-more-half-all-california-drivers-licenses-go-u/

Barack Obama tells Jon Stewart the economy, 'by every metric, is better' than when he took office
","During his farewell visit to Jon Stewart’s Daily Show, President Barack Obama took a bit of a victory lap. At one point in the extended interview posted online, Obama said, ""Here's the thing I can say, Jon. I can say this unequivocally: The VA is better now than when I came into office; government works better than when I came into office; the economy, by every metric, is better than when I came into office."" It was the last of those claims -- that ""the economy, by every metric, is better than when I came into office"" -- that caught our attention. That’s a pretty strong statement. Is it correct? Statistics that support Obama’s claim Three common economic statistics that are widely considered important are gross domestic product, unemployment rate and employment level. And looking just at these three measurements, Obama has a strong record in office. • Gross domestic product per capita. Inflation adjusted GDP per capita -- that is, all economic activity in the United States divided by the number of U.S. residents -- has increased from $47,002 in 2009 to $54,630 in 2014, an increase of 16 percent since Obama took office. • Unemployment rate. In January 2009, the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent. After peaking at 10 percent in October 2009, the rate fell to 5.3 percent by June 2015. That’s a drop in unemployment of almost one-third since Obama’s inauguration, and it’s been mirrored in drops among African-Americans and Latinos. • Employment level. In January 2009, total nonfarm employment in the United States stood just shy of 134 million. By February 2010, employment had fallen to 129.6 million, but by June 2015 it had rebounded to 141.8 million. That’s an increase in jobs of almost 6 percent from the start of Obama’s term. Where things haven’t gone so well for Obama While Obama has some statistics to point to, it is wrong to say that ""the economy, by every metric, is better than when I came into office."" We found several important measurements that went in the wrong direction during Obama’s tenure. • Real median weekly earnings. Between the first quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2015, inflation-adjusted weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers fell from $348 to $344, a decline of about 1 percent. Comparing the second quarter of 2009 and the second quarter of 2015, weekly earnings fell from $342 to $337, a decline of about 1.4 percent. • Median income. Inflation-adjusted median household income, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, fell from $54,059 in 2009 to $51,939 in 2013 -- a decline of about 4 percent. (Depending on how you adjust these raw numbers for taxes and in-kind income, inflation-adjusted income per person may have gone up a bit rather than shrinking.) • Percent of people in poverty. The data show that 13.2 percent of Americans were living in poverty in March 2009. By March 2014, that percentage had risen to 14.5 percent. That was down slightly from what it was in the previous three years, but not enough to match the 2009 level. • Median weeks unemployed. In January 2009, the median number of weeks an unemployed person was unemployed was 10.7. By June 2015, that number had risen to 11.3 weeks. (The peak of 25.2 weeks came in June 2010.) • Civilian labor force participation rate. This is the percentage of people either working or looking for work, divided by the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. In January 2009, this stood at 65.7 percent, but by June 2015, it had fallen to 62.6 percent. The caution here is that this statistic has been affected by the increasing rate of retirements due to the aging of the Baby Boomers. However, most economists say that the weak recovery has played at least some role in this decline. • Number of people on food stamps. The number of recipients has risen from 33.5 million in 2009 to 46.5 million in 2014, an increase of 39 percent. What is hard to say is how much comes from expanded accessibility rules and how much comes from rising economic need. The White House argues that Obama deserves credit for achieving an economic recovery ""sustainably."" ""We’ve had growth surge while also shedding debt and building a more sustainable foundation,"" said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. ""We’re growing faster and safer.""   Our ruling Obama said, ""The economy, by every metric, is better than when I came into office."" That claim is too sweeping. Certain measures of wages and income, the poverty rate and the duration of unemployment are all worse now than they were when Obama ""came into office."" The statement contains an element of truth but ignores facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/jul/28/barack-obama/barack-obama-tells-jon-stewart-economy-every-metri/

Obama says veteran homelessness has been cut by a third
","Ever since Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump criticized the war record of Vietnam veteran Sen. John McCain on July 20, the treatment of veterans has been a major point of political discussion. President Barack Obama got into the fray in his July 21  interview with Jon Stewart on the Comedy Central program The Daily Show, during an unaired, exclusively online portion of the interview. Stewart questioned Obama on the state of veteran health care, citing, among other things, the VA’s long wait times. Obama defended the government agency, claiming the VA is structurally better than when he entered office, though it remains underfunded and its employees overworked. Later in the interview, he further defended his record when it comes to serving veterans. ""Let’s take something like homelessness among veterans. So we’ve cut that by a third,"" Obama said. That one-third number struck us. Does Obama have the facts to back it up? One independent agency dedicated to fighting homelessness thinks so. On the ""Veterans"" page of the National Alliance to End Homelessness’ website, it reads, ""In 2009, the Obama Administration committed to ending veteran homelessness in the U.S. by the end of 2015. Since 2010, there has been a 33 percent decrease in the number of homeless veterans."" Nan Roman, the CEO and president of the Alliance, said the 33 percent decrease is backed by the yearly ""point in time,"" called PIT, count of homeless veterans. Every year, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) releases a detailed report about the state of homelessness in the United States to Congress, called the Annual Homeless Assessment Report. The 2014 report reported 49,933 homeless veterans according to the point in time count, a 32.57 percent decrease from the 2009 count of 74,050. The 2015 numbers are not yet available, but Roman said she expects further decreases. National ""point in time"" counts were first conducted in 2009, during the peak of the recession, so it is possible that the decline in homelessness among veterans has been symptomatic of the larger national economic recovery. But the count has been largely consistent since then. But what is a ""point in time"" count, and what do other metrics say about veteran homelessness? According to Dennis Culhane, a professor who studies homelessness at the University of Pennsylvania, the PIT count is conducted around the same time every year by individual cities. The number is supposed to reflect the total number of homeless people, ""sheltered"" and ""unsheltered,"" on a given night in a given city. Cities must do a count if they are to receive HUD funding. The ""sheltered"" count is easy. When homeless people stay in temporary, government-sponsored housing, they have to register with city officials. It’s the ""unsheltered"" population, the people living on the street, who pose a counting challenge According to Culhane, not every city counts the same way. Some literally count by hand the number of homeless people living on the street. Some estimate based on how likely it is to find a homeless person in a given area of a city. And some even change their counting methodology from year to year, forcing revised estimates that can change the national number. Despite some inevitable discrepancies, Roman said the PIT numbers are consistent. ""They may be imperfect, but they’re imperfect in the same way every single year,"" Roman said.   Further complicating things, it can be difficult to ascertain whether certain unsheltered homeless people are veterans. Sometimes, those who have served do not identify as such, or, on the flip side, people exaggerate their service. The PIT count also isn’t the only statistic for counting the homeless veteran population. Brian Sullivan, the supervisory public affairs specialist at HUD, pointed us to both the PIT number and the one-year estimate of sheltered veterans, a different metric. That number isn’t limited by the small time frame of the PIT count. It uses an entire year’s worth of data. The one-year estimate of sheltered veterans does not support the 33 percent number Obama offered. According to the most recent data, there were just 6.5 percent fewer homeless veterans from 2009 to 2013. But Roman and Culhane say the PIT number is preferred over the one-year estimate because the PIT takes into account both sheltered and unsheltered veterans. ""I would use the PIT count. Annual data would be strong, if they included all veterans (i.e., unsheltered as well as sheltered),"" Roman wrote in an email. ""Over one-third of the homeless veteran population is unsheltered on a given night. That is a large percentage of the population to ignore."" Culhane said the biggest drop in the homeless veteran population has been among the unsheltered, so ignoring that slice of the population would be counterintuitive. The only reason to be skeptical of the Annual Homeless Assessment Report numbers, Roman said, would be because they are pretty much the only numbers available.   ""It’s the administration reporting on the administration’s data, and we don’t have any verification of it,"" Roman said. Culhane, who helps with the count as the director of research for the VA’s National Center for Homelessness Among Veterans, said there were multiple reasons to believe the numbers. For one, he pointed out, individual communities conduct the counts. For another, Obama and Congress together have thrown a lot of money at this problem in recent years. ""In 2009, the federal budget for veteran homelessness was $400 million and that paid for a transitional housing program that was basically a fancy shelter,"" he said. ""Now the budget is $1.5 billion."" Roman agreed. ""There’s a lot of work going on in communities to find every veteran, and there’s a lot of money being spent to get them into housing,"" she said. She pointed to the Supportive Services for Veterans Families and HUD-VA Supportive Housing programs, which have both cut down significantly on the cost of housing for homeless veterans. Our ruling Obama said, ""Let’s take something like homelessness among veterans. So we’ve cut that by a third."" According to the most recent, best available data, he’s right. During his tenure, homelessness among veterans has decreased 32.57 percent. However, that number is based on estimates that have an element of uncertainty. Also, funding to end homelessness among veterans has received bipartisan support in Congress. Still, Obama’s point is largely accurate, and we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jul/28/barack-obama/obama-says-veteran-homelessness-has-been-cut-third/

Donald Trump says that under Scott Walker, Wisconsin budget went from projected surplus to a deficit
","On July 25, 2015, the day after news that a Scott Walker ally had called him a ""dumb-dumb,"" Donald Trump delighted in dumping on the Wisconsin governor during a campaign speech in Iowa. ""I read this horrible statement from his fundraiser about Trump. I said, ‘Oh, finally, I can attack,’ "" the New York businessman said to laughter in Oskaloosa. ""Finally, finally."" Trump -- second to Walker among Republican presidential contenders in an Iowa poll earlier in the week -- criticized him on several fronts. Then he made a claim about the fortunes of Wisconsin’s finances. ""Wisconsin’s doing terribly. First of all, it’s in turmoil,"" Trump said. ""The roads are a disaster because they don’t have any money to rebuild them. They’re borrowing money like crazy. They projected a $1 billion surplus and it turns out to be a deficit of $2.2 billion."" Let’s focus on that last part. Is Trump right that a projected $1 billion surplus became a $2.2 billion deficit? Trump is partly on the money, but he’s mixing apples and oranges, and his use of the word deficit is problematic. The rules By law, Wisconsin’s two-year budgets must be balanced -- revenue equalling expenditures. So, unlike the federal government, Wisconsin can never run an actual budget deficit by borrowing money that piles up as debt. That being said, the state does various projections of what revenues and expenditures will be for the upcoming two-year budget cycle. Those projections can show a surplus or a deficit -- although ""deficit"" is more accurately termed a projected shortfall, since there is no actual red ink. Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to our requests for evidence to back his claim. But the two figures he cited were projections that received plenty of attention when they were made. And we have dealt with them repeatedly in the past. The two figures In January 2014, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau projected Wisconsin would see a surplus of about $1 billion by June 30, 2015 -- the end of the 2013-’15 budget cycle. At the time, revenues were coming in higher than expected. Walker and the GOP-run Legislature adopted a series of tax cuts later in 2014, making good on a Walker promise to return such surpluses to taxpayers, but drawing criticism for not using the money for other purposes, such as boosting the state’s rainy day fund. Along the way, however, tax collections grew at a slower pace than had been projected.   By November 2014, there was a reversal of fortune: Walker’s own Department of Administration projected a $2.2 billion shortfall for 2015-’17. Once again, that figure was not an actual deficit. Indeed, even as a projected shortfall it was overstated. That’s because the standard for projections made in the months leading up to the next budget cycle is to include all the funding requests made by state agencies -- even though, in reality, those requests always get trimmed. That serves to temporarily inflate the actual picture. In the end, the 2015-’17 budget approved by the Legislature and signed by Walker in July 2015 was balanced -- just as every other Wisconsin state budget is. Our rating Mixing apples and oranges, Trump said that under Walker, Wisconsin ""projected a $1 billion (budget) surplus and it turns out to be a deficit of $2.2 billion."" There was in early 2014 a projection of a $1 billion surplus heading into the 2015-’17 budget period. Late in 2014, there was a projection of a $2.2 billion shortfall -- the difference between expected revenues and the amount of money being requested by state agencies. But the shortfall was never a deficit -- and some of the surplus was consciously spent by Republicans, as tax cuts. For a statement that contains only an element of truth and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/jul/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-under-scott-walker-wisconsin-bud/

Perdue hits the mark on agency's redundancy
","Don’t worry if you have never heard of the National Technical Information Service. You can look it up online. That’s a big part of the point of Senate Bill 1636, the Just Google It Act. It would eliminate that obscure office within the U.S. Commerce Department. The office’s mandate, as of its 1950 creation: serve as the main repository for government-funded technical, scientific and business reports. The agency estimates it holds more than 3 million documents across some 350 topics. But its own website encourages users to check with other government agencies and conduct an Internet search before requesting documents. Why? The answer is in the numbers. By comparison, the first Google index of the Internet in 1998 had 26 million pages. By 2000, there were 1 billion pages. And Google isn’t charging money for many of the same documents that the NTIS is charging taxpayers to catalog and print. ""Georgians are frustrated by the federal government because it is plagued by wasteful spending and redundancy, and the National Technical Information Service is a perfect example of both,"" U.S. Sen. David Perdue, one of the bill’s co-sponsors, said in a press release. So, is the government spending an estimated $170 million a year of taxpayer money to make documents publicly available when a search engine does it for free? We decided to check. GOVERNMENT 101 Take an introductory political science course (and hopefully a high school civics class) and you learn government’s role in providing services. Part of the theory around all that is government’s role in providing what may have social value but not necessarily earn a profit. Spreading the costs among all citizens in the form of taxes is how government provides things such as a military on the national level and schools on the local level. Government watchdogs, though, have for years questioned spending on services where private-sector competition could lower taxes on everyone. Toll roads, anyone? But not everything that seems wasteful turns out to have no value. Consider the National Helium Reserve. The federal government set it up in 1925 to act as a strategic supply for dirigibles back when the U.S. worried about German airships in battle. It served as a punch line through the decades, including during a 2013 congressional vote to extend the program. But the jokes belied why it still exists. Helium became an important coolant during the Space Race and, later, a key way to keep computers and other technology contaminant-free, all during a time when the private sector was unable to meet demand. So, could the National Technical Information Service be a similar program that sounds ridiculous but actually is not? THE NTIS The Government Accountability Office looked at that very question in 2012. After examining the agency’s organization, function, staffing levels, demand for reports and work, the GAO found that 74 percent of the NTIS reports between 1990 and 2011 were ""readily available"" elsewhere, usually from the originating agency’s website. And 95 percent of that 74 percent of reports were free, the GAO estimated, while the NTIS lost an average of $1 million a year for the past decade. ""In looking across the years, at one point they were self-sustaining as a repository,"" said Valerie C. Melvin, director of the GAO’s Information Management and Technology Resources Issues Office. ""But we found it was not able to sustain itself with the demand and sale of reports in recent years and suggested Congress look at the viability of its statutory function,"" she said. Melvin testified to those findings about a dated business model before the U.S, Senate in 2014. NTIS Director Bruce Borzino countered in his own testimony that his office is the one posting many of those reports to the Web. And many other federal departments do not have the technical expertise to maintain the permanent access of their information. A spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia that the office also ""tags"" much of the agencies’ documents – effectively making them available for Google and other search engines to find them. Some 800,000 documents also are available for free that way, spokeswoman Gail Porter said. ""As NTIS evolves, its service portfolio will continue to grow by supporting the entire data delivery pipeline for trusted data networks with stringent privacy and security with a focus on increasing access to data, combining data in new ways and delivering better service,"" Porter said. It will be up to Congress to take the information from the NTIS and GAO and decide what’s next. Last spring Sens. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, and Kelly Ayotte, a New Hampshire Republican, introduced the Let Me Google That for You bill that would have gutted the NTIS but not killed it outright. That effort cleared the Senate but stalled in the House, opening the door for the bill that Perdue is now co-sponsoring. Perdue’s spokeswoman said Georgia’s freshman senator felt the new bill acknowledges that many government agencies already put their reports online – showing why NTIS is redundant. The bill also would give the Commerce Department a year to phase out the office, so that any ""critical functions"" can be shifted to another division or agency as needed. ""It’s outlived its original intent, especially now that every government agency has a website that is, or should be, more accessible and searchable for public records,"" Perdue spokeswoman Megan Whittemore said. Government watchdogs have kept an eye on the debate but rarely lobbied one way or the other. The GAO report, after all, shows that the NTIS often has the older reports that are harder to find online. And it shows value in the expertise to make sure documents are posted online for search engines to find. But Steve Ellis, the vice president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, said Congress might be better served making it clear that every government department must start doing that work itself. ""The question isn’t about NTIS, but why there are still agencies not putting up their own documents,"" Ellis said. ""Just like how we all went from getting a paycheck to using Direct Deposit, the government has to evolve with the times."" OUR RULING U.S. Sen. David Perdue said a small government office is spending taxpayer money to print and sell government reports that are available online for free. A 2012 GAO report backs up some of that claim, finding that three-quarters of the National Technical Information Service’s reports were available online. That number reflects a growing trend of government agencies posting their own scientific and technical reports to the Web, where anyone can search and print them out for free. But the claim ignores the fact that the NTIS is responsible for some of the posting and tagging that make those reports easy to find on Google. Perdue’s statement hits on a popular topic, attacking what appears to be government waste. He’s accurate but ignores some information that adds nuance to the debate.
