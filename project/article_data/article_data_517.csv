Norwood says Georgia has most ""restrictive"" ballot access laws in U.S.
","Mary Norwood often said during last year’s unsuccessful run for Atlanta mayor that she was not red or blue, but purple.In other words, Norwood claimed she was not a strict disciple of either the Democratic or the Republican parties.So when Norwood jumped into the race earlier this year for Fulton County Commission chairman, she decided to run as an independent. So far, her toughest battle is not with the incumbent, John Eaves, but getting on the Nov. 2 ballot.“Georgia has the most restrictive ballot access laws in the country,” Norwood, a former two-term Atlanta city councilwoman, said during a television interview Tuesday evening.That claim was too juicy for PolitiFact Georgia to resist checking out.We began by asking the Norwood camp for details. Anne Fauver, her campaign manager, explained. Georgia requires independent candidates running for countywide offices to get at least 5 percent of all registered voters eligible to vote in the last election in that jurisdiction to sign a petition supporting their placement on the ballot.“I didn’t know how restrictive it was in comparison to other states,” said Fauver, who served with Norwood on the City Council.Norwood needs about 22,700 signatures to get on the ballot. Thus far, she is “more than halfway” to her goal, Fauver said. Norwood has until July 13 to reach the magic number.Norwood has taken Eaves to court over what she calls a “hypertechnical interpretation” of the law to discount about 3,000 of the signatures she has collected. The Eaves campaign says each petition signer must write “Fulton,” along with their address, on the form. Norwood says Fulton election officials told her she could pre-type “Fulton” on the form. A judge dismissed Norwood’s complaint on this point Thursday, saying, in part, that any ruling before the deadline “would constitute an advisory opinion.”As for the 5 percent rule, we reached out to Richard Winger, the California-based editor of Ballot Access News. He has studied ballot issues for more than four decades. Winger was called a “savant” on the topic by Columbia University professor Nate Persily and “the nation’s encyclopedia on this stuff” by Capital University Law School professor Bradley Smith.“That is the toughest such law in the country,” Winger said of Georgia.Until 1943, any political party could gain across-the-board ballot access by registering a slate of officers with the secretary of state. State leaders changed the system that year, primarily to discourage Communist Party candidates from getting on the ballot, Winger said. Some Southern states also used such rules to ensure that a white candidate would win, Smith said.The laws gradually changed over the years for some offices, Winger said. Statewide independent candidates now need the signatures of 1 percent of registered voters to get on the ballot. The rules stayed the same for independent candidates seeking a municipal or countywide office, or seats in Congress or the Georgia Legislature.Why hasn’t the law changed? For some reason, Winger said, state lawmakers couldn’t agree in the 1980s on several proposed bills that would have made it easier for people to get on the ballot to potentially run against them.A bill that would have removed the requirement that independent candidates gather signatures on a petition to run for office did not pass earlier this year.Winger ranks North Carolina as having the second-most-restrictive ballot access guidelines for independent countywide candidates. The Tar Heel State requires those candidates to get the signatures of 4 percent of registered voters in the county to get on the ballot. Winger ranked Illinois as third, but it’s worth noting that state also requires independent countywide candidates to get 5 percent of the signatures of voters who cast ballots in the 2008 election. As for her claim on Georgia’s rules about ballot access, the Peach State and Illinois both have similar ballot access guidelines. Therefore, we rate Norwood’s statement as True.

Obama flip-flops on use of presidential commissions
","During a campaign appearance in Grand Junction, Colo., on Sept. 17, 2008, Barack Obama made light of his rival, John McCain, for suggesting that a commission study the Wall Street meltdown that had just taken place.""John McCain's big solution to the crisis we're facing is -- get ready for this -- a commission,"" Obama told the crowd. ""A commission. That's Washington-speak for we'll get -- we'll get back to you later.""Obama continued, ""You know, folks, we don't need a commission to figure out what happened. We know what happened: Too many in Washington and on Wall Street weren't minding the store. CEOs got greedy. Lobbyists got their way. Politicians sat on their hands until it was too late. We don't need a commission to tell us how we got into this mess, we need a president who will lead us out of this mess, and that's the kind of president I intend to be.""So what kind of president did Obama become? A president who has established at least four commissions.First, some background. Commissions are typically headed jointly by a Republican and a Democrat. Members may be appointed by the president, Congressional leaders or a mix of the two. The commissions -- sometimes known as blue-ribbon panels -- are charged with studying a thorny topic and making recommendations. Usually the recommendations are not binding, but they can serve as blueprints for future Congressional and presidential action.Sometimes commissions make an impact, such as the bipartisan panel that investigated the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Its recommendations, after some delay, were made into law. Other times, commissions produce reports that get put on a shelf and are quickly forgotten. Some in Washington, such as candidate Obama, dismiss commissions as a way to make it look like you’re making progress in attacking a difficult problem without actually doing the heavy lifting of trying to pass a bill.Experts say that critics of commissions have a point.How useful a commission is ""varies widely with the quality of leadership, the amount of funding and the commitment of the staff,"" said Paul Light, a New York University professor who is currently studying commissions for the Governance Institute. ""Some are serious, and some are designed to distract the public and move an issue out of the headlines.""Whatever their value, Light added, the number of commissions has climbed over the years. ""I suspect (Obama) will end up with 16 to 20 of them if he wins a second term,"" he said. Obama's commissions aren't on trivial subjects. Here are the ones we were able to locate:• The BP oil spill. On May 22, 2010, Obama signed an order establishing the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. The panel is ""tasked with providing recommendations on how we can prevent – and mitigate the impact of – any future spills that result from offshore drilling,"" according to the White House. Obama named former Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., and former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly to co-chair the commission.• The national debt. On Feb. 18, 2010, Obama established the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. The commission’s co-chairs – former Clinton White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and former Senate Republican Whip Alan Simpson of Wyoming – were asked to ""bring Republicans and Democrats together"" to tackle the nation's ""looming fiscal challenges.""• Nuclear energy policy. On Jan. 29, 2010, Obama asked Energy Secretary Steven Chu to form a ""Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future."" The panel would ""conduct a comprehensive review of policies for managing the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle, including all alternatives for the storage, processing and disposal of civilian and defense used nuclear fuel and nuclear waste."" • Bioethics. On Nov. 24, 2009, Obama established a new Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, chaired by University of Pennsylvania president Amy Gutmann and vice-chaired by Emory University president James W. Wagner. The commission will ""advise the president on bioethical issues that may emerge from advances in biomedicine and related areas of science and technology."" The White House declined to comment for this story. To be fair, establishing a commission does not necessarily mean that the administration has taken a pass on these issues. Obviously, the White House is deeply involved on many fronts in tackling the oil spill, from directing the cleanup to pushing legislation through Congress. And on the deficit, the administration has implemented a three-year, non-defense, discretionary spending freeze in this year’s budget, as well as signed a deficit-neutral, pay-as-you-go budget bill. (Not everyone is convinced that these measures will reduce the deficit significantly, however.)Still, we think it’s worth pointing out Obama’s change in stance, since his initial comment was a calculated, pointed barb at McCain and because he’s turned to the commission model as president to address more than just minor issues. Ultimately, on the use of presidentially appointed commissions, Obama merits a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2010/jul/01/barack-obama/obama-flip-flops-use-presidential-commissions/

Klein lumps all of West's donors together
","Democratic Congressman Ron Klein has gone on the offensive in his campaign against Republican retired Army Lt. Col. Allen West -- whose $2 million war chest and national media attention have turned the race into one of the hottest Congressional contests in Florida. Klein represents a swing Congressional district that spans parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties.Klein wants to capitalize on voters' anger about the BP spill and hammers West in a June 28 fundraising e-mail. The bulk of his e-mail with the subject line ""Apologize to BP?!"" relates to West's stance on the oil spill and his connection to Congressman Joe Barton, the Texas Republican facing heat after apologizing to BP and calling Obama's demand for the escrow account a ""shakedown.""""In short, while sheets of oil are washing up today on Pensacola Beach, he’s more concerned with BP’s profits than the livelihood of fishermen, restaurateurs, or those that depend on FL tourism...,"" Klein wrote about his opponent West. ""Barton called the Obama administration’s push for BP to set up a $20 billion account - a fund that would ultimately help pay for clean up and damages and wages for those who are losing their livelihood - a 'shakedown.' Most Republicans have made it very clear that Barton’s actions were unacceptable. Not Allen West. A continuing supporter of offshore drilling, West’s campaign is now aligned with those who would apparently give BP a pass. Thus far, the most radical Tea Partiers have taken a liking to West and what he stands for. They also haven’t been shy in contributing to his cause. West has raised $2 million from those that would leave our beaches in ruins, end Social Security and Medicare, and give corporations free reign."" There are a lot of strong statements in Klein's letter that we could have chosen to fact-check. But we particularly thought that last sentence was a biting claim, and we don't mean the usual spelling of ""free rein."" Note Klein didn't say that West would ruin Florida's beaches, end Social Security and Medicare, and give corporations free rein -- he said that $2 million in donations to West came from donors who held those views. For this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to explore whether ""West has raised $2 million from those that would leave our beaches in ruins, end Social Security and Medicare, and give corporations free reign.""We contacted Klein's campaign and asked for documentation to support their claim. Campaign spokeswoman Sarah Rothschild sent us about two dozen citations for news articles and web sites that relate to West and his donors, but she declined to define what Klein meant by ""give corporations free reign."" We looked at most of their citations, focusing on BP and Rep. Joe Barton since that was the point of Klein's e-mail, and we break the other donors down by topic below.First, we confirmed that West had raised $2,065,855 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. It's not logical to assume that every one those donors would ruin the beaches and end Medicare and Social Security. We found a few tenuous connections to those issues among a small handful of donors but not enough for a blanket statement.Congressman Joe BartonWest got $1,000 from Rep. Joe Barton's Texas Freedom Fund PAC on March 3, 2010, FEC reports show. On June 17 at a Congressional hearing on BP, Barton, the ranking member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, defended BP. The Wasington Post's Right Now blog reported that Barton said: ""It is a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown, in this case a $20 billion shakedown.""Later the same day, Barton apologized for his apology after Republican leaders threatened to take away his committee leadership position.The Tampa Tribune reported June 25 that West about a week earlier had also raised concerns about the BP escrow account at a business luncheon in Palm Beach Gardens. ""West said that while he was 'angry with BP' for the spill, 'when you have an executive branch that goes to a private sector business and takes their private equity funds and demands that they put it into an escrow account, something is upside down in this country. That is a very dangerous precedent that we establish.'"" Even though West may not like the way the restitution happened, the Freedom Fund donation came about a month before the Gulf oil well blowout.So we moved on to the other citations Klein's camp sent us.Oil and gas, banks The PACsNext, we looked at political action committees, some of them set up by controversial public officials: Clearly, West has taken money from at least a few donors that have either been sympathetic to BP, in favor of massive cuts to Social Security and Medicare or affiliated with corporations that have been accused of wrongdoing. But that's not what Klein's campaign said. Klein's fundraising e-mail said: ""West has raised $2 million from those that would leave our beaches in ruins, end Social Security and Medicare and give corporations free reign."" The donors the Klein campaign cited added up to about $25,000 -- only a sliver of his $2 million campaign. The West campaign could cherrypick too and likely find negative headlines about some of Klein's donors -- including BP in previous election cycles. But we don't think that we can draw conclusions about all of Klein's donors based on his BP donations. Similarily, there is no way Klein would know the viewpoints of all of West's donors unless he researched all of their views on these topics -- an impossible endeavor. We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2010/jul/01/ron-klein/klein-lumps-all-wests-donors-together/
"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Judson Hill']","
State Senator said he's fighting Obama on health care
","State Sen. Judson Hill told voters he entered the ring against President Barack Obama and won. The Marietta Republican is running for re-election in a contest that is already knee-deep in mud. Hill fired back with a mailer that reminded his constituents about early voting and announced that ""Senator Judson Hill Is Standing Up To Barack Obama's Socialist Healthcare.""""Judson Hill is leading the charge,"" the mailer said. ""This year Judson stood up to Barack Obama by passing legislation that prevents you from being forced to join government health plans or buy health insurance against your will.""Hill's mailer referred to his work on Senate Bill 411, which was signed into law June 2. The bill bans any law that requires individuals to purchase health insurance. Such a mandate was a crucial element of federal health care legislation passed this spring. But did Hill really score an Obama K.O.? Does the state law really prevent you from ""being forced to join government health plans""? Republicans spent months in Congress unsuccessfully arguing that Democrats' health efforts would infringe upon individual liberties and hurt the quality of care. Now the battleground has moved to the states. Governors and legislators across the nation are working to pass measures that prevent the health care overhaul from taking effect inside their borders. Some filed a suit against the federal government in March that Georgia joined in May. Hill labored for much of this year's legislative session on the Georgia effort. First, he sponsored Senate Resolution 794, which would have amended the state constitution to let Georgians opt out of federally mandated health care. When that effort failed, Hill tried to amend state law by sponsoring SB 317, which stated that ""no law or rule or regulation shall compel any person, employer, or health care provider to participate in any health care system."" This bill passed in the Senate but withered in the House. Hill's effort succeeded after language from SB 317 was added to SB 411, the Healthy Georgians Act of 2010, which was originally proposed to change the regulation of wellness plans. It was signed into law June 2.SB 411 would -- in theory -- block a provision of the federal health care overhaul that requires most U.S. citizens and legal residents to have health care coverage by 2014 or be subject to a tax. This is often called an ""individual mandate"" for health insurance. But it's not clear whether the new law has any teeth. Its fate rests on constitutional issues that go well beyond this state. The Hill campaign acknowledged as much. The mandate doesn't go into effect for about four years, and a lot of things can change before then. ""A lot of it is sort of a waiting game,"" said Jeremy Brand, a spokesman for the campaign. Other proponents agree. The American Legislative Exchange Council, which advocates for free markets and limited government, is coordinating the nationwide effort for states to enact legislation and constitutional amendments blocking the mandate. It assisted with drafting and researching the Georgia bill, said Christie Herrera, director of ALEC's Health and Human Services Task Force. Hill is a task force member. The bill is designed to position Georgia to fight the individual mandate by giving it standing in an ongoing lawsuit filed in March by multiple states' attorneys general against the federal health care legislation, Herrera said. If that challenge is unsuccessful, the bill would open the door for Georgia to file its own suit arguing the law violates the 10th Amendment, which defines states' rights.And if all else fails, the bill makes it possible for the state attorney general to sue after the mandate goes into effect in 2014 on behalf of Georgians he or she thinks were harmed by the individual mandate.""I would say that there is never a guarantee of success when a state challenges the federal government. However, to the extent that the state Legislature can stop the federal individual mandate, then SB 411 is the best possible defense,"" Herrera said in an e-mail to PolitiFact Georgia.Backers of Georgia's efforts think a constitutional challenge may succeed, but this opinion is far from unanimous. A February article in The New England Journal of Medicine written by a legal scholar calls the success of a constitutional challenge ""very unlikely"" because the court would have to reject ""decades of precedents."" Larry Palmer, a specialist in health law and policy with the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Va., said in a March article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that state action will likely have little impact because the federal government has ""extremely broad"" power to provide incentives and disincentives through the tax code. State Attorney General Thurbert Baker declined to join the multistate suit because he thought the lawsuit would fail and waste taxpayers' money. Georgia only joined the suit after Gov. Sonny Perdue found a team of attorneys willing to fight the federal legislation at no cost to the state. While it's true that SB 411 did stand up to the Obama-backed health care overhaul, it's far from clear that the law can actually be enforced. There is a chance that the bill, in the future, will allow Georgians to opt out of federal health care requirements. But for now, that pronouncement is premature. We rate Hill's claim Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/01/judson-hill/state-senator-said-hes-fighting-obama-health-care/
"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Ritch Workman']","
Workman misquotes immigration report
","As Florida lawmakers prepare to introduce their own version of Arizona's strict immigration law, Republican state Rep. Ritch Workman has been championing the cause by painting the state's illegal immigrant population as the scourge of fiscal conservatism, business owners and taxpayers.""All businesses and taxpayers face the unfair burden of providing federally mandated services to illegal immigrants, and putting the brakes on this noncitizen entitlement program will save Arizona a considerable amount of money,"" wrote Workman in a Florida Today opinion page article on June 6, 2010. ""In Florida alone, more than $3.5 billion a year is spent on health care and criminal justice for illegal immigrants. Given this, I think it is time for Florida to follow Arizona’s lead.""$3.5 billion and change is a lot of money in a state that had to close a $6 billion budget gap in 2010, so PolitiFact Florida decided to take this claim on a ride through the Truth-O-Meter. Workman's district office directed us to the Florida House Majority Office, which distributes talking points to its Republican members. Staff director Todd Reid told us Workman was slightly off. He gave us a $3.8 billion figure culled from a February 2009 report, ""The Costs of Illegal Immigration to Floridians,"" published by the Federation for American Immigration Reform.The report, which looks at projected government spending on education, health and incarceration, is one of many fiscal analyses distributed by FAIR, an anti-illegal-immigration group based in Washington, D.C.To determine Florida's illegal immigration tab, FAIR's special projects director Jack Martin singled out the average cost of government services according to, in many instances, other private studies, and then multiplied those figures by the group's estimated immigration population.To be sure, pinpointing the size of a demographic that doesn't want to be tracked is not an exact science, but it is worth noting that FAIR's conclusions are based on inexact estimates. For example, FAIR ranked Florida's illegal immigration population fourth in the nation, with an estimated 950,000 immigrants in 2008. In contrast, the Department of Homeland Security ranks Florida third in the nation, with 720,000 illegal immigrants in 2009. Some of FAIR's other conclusions raise questions.To start, FAIR's education costs are based on the assumption that nearly every student enrolled in English learning classes is the child of illegal immigrants, since, ""the children of immigrants legally admitted for permanent residence are likely to already speak English because the parents lived in the United States as nonimmigrants, prepared for years to immigrate to the United States, or arrived from countries where English is taught in the schools,"" according to the report. That explanation of the students is not a fact, which casts doubts on FAIR's final education tally.Here's another example. FAIR bases its health care costs on a 2002 Florida Hospital Association survey that found unreimbursed emergency medical care for illegal immigrants toppled $40 million. But the survey includes responses from private hospitals that are not funded by the state.How about one more? FAIR produces the state's incarceration costs for illegal immigrants based on the state Department of Corrections' ""illegal alien"" count of inmates. However, no such count exists. Instead, the state keeps tabs on all inmates who are not U.S. citizens, whether they're in the country legally or illegally. While many of those inmates are eventually released to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for further immigration processing, including possible deportation, the state does not track whether its inmates are legal U.S. residents.""I would take FAIR's numbers with a big shaker of salt,"" said Daniel Griswold, director of the Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian Washington, D.C., policy group. ""The organization exists to portray immigrants in a bad light.""Still, even if FAIR's math passed muster, the report's findings would not validate Workman's claim.FAIR concludes the bulk of state expenses related to illegal immigrants, or $3.4 billion, is spent on educating the children of illegal immigrants, including children who were born here and thus are U.S. citizens.Only $380 million was spent on uncompensated medical care and incarceration, a far cry from Workman's $3.5 billion-claim, a seemingly impossible figure, acknowledged FAIR. ""The magnitude of the fiscal cost estimate would require the inclusion of the educational costs,"" said Martin, who wrote the FAIR report.Just to be sure, we checked with state health and criminal justice officials. The state budget cites six criminal justice branches: the Department of Corrections, the Justice Administration, the Department of Juvenile Justice, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the Department of Legal Affairs/Attorney General and the Parole Commission. Representatives for each of those departments said they do not track how many illegal immigrants receive services each year. Consequently, any related costs were unknown, they said. The state's health agencies also said they don't count illegal immigrants.Nor do state courts.""The Office of the State Courts Administrator tells me that they are not required to keep such data, so they do not,"" said spokesman Craig Waters.Or state auditors. ""We haven't been told to do that,"" said Kathy McGuire, deputy director of the Florida Legislature's Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability, when asked for state fiscal projections related to illegal immigration. ""I think it is an emerging issue. It hasn't been a concern in past sessions.""Time for some math of our own. It seems Workman grossly misquoted numbers pushed by an anti-illegal-immigration group to bolster his argument against illegal immigration. But, the group's conclusions are suspect because they are based on assumptions and estimates, not facts, which multiple state agencies confirmed. None of this adds up. We rate Workman's claim False. Correction: The Cato Institute is a libertarian Washington, D.C., policy group. As originally published, we mistakenly described the Cato Institute's political leaning.",/factchecks/2010/jun/30/ritch-workman/workman-misquotes-immigration-report/
"['National', 'Kagan Nomination', 'LGBTQ', 'Military', 'Elena Kagan']","
Kagan says at the height of military recuitment controversy at Harvard Law School, military recruitment actually went up
","During her Supreme Court nomination hearing, Elena Kagan faced intense questioning from Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, about her decision to bar military recruiters from using the Harvard Law School's Office of Career Services during part of her tenure as the school's dean.Kagan defended her decision and repeatedly backed it up with a claim that the number of military recruits actually went up.""Senator, the military at all times during my deanship had full and good access,"" Kagan said. ""Military recruiting did not go down. Indeed, in a couple of years, including the year that you're particularly referring to, it went up. And it went up because we ensured that students would know that the military recruiters were coming to our campus. Because I talked about how important military service was. Because our veterans organization and the veterans on campus did an absolutely terrific job, a terrific service to their fellow students in talking to them about the honor of military service.""Sessions said he was ""just a little taken aback by the tone of your remarks, because it's unconnected to reality.""Kagan later said she ""always tried to make sure that I conveyed my honor for the military. And I always tried to make sure that the military had excellent access to our students. And in the short period of time, Sen. Sessions, that the military had that access through the veterans organization, military recruiting actually went up.""We've dealt with the military recruitment issue from several angles, and here we decided to tackle the claim that the number of military recruits went up at the height of the campus controversy.In previous PolitiFact items, we have gone into some detail about the controversial history of military recruiting at Harvard Law School, which long predated Kagan's tenure as dean from 2003-2009. But the bottom line is that military recruiters were only ever barred from the school's Office of Career Services for one semester in 2005. During that time, Kagan encouraged the military to recruit through the Harvard Law School Veterans Association, a student organization (now called the Harvard Law School Armed Forces Association). In all other years Kagan was dean at Harvard Law School, military recruiters were permitted to use the Office of Career Services (despite Kagan steadfastly lodging her opposition to the military's ""discriminatory recruitment"" based on the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy which ""deprives many men and women of courage and character from having the opportunity to serve their country in the greatest way possible."")So we are really talking here about the 2005 spring semester during which Kagan arguably made it the most difficult for military recruiters, by barring them from the Office of Career Services. ""The symbolic effect of this special treatment of military recruiters was important, but the practical effect on recruiting logistics was minimal,"" wrote Robert C. Clark, a professor and dean at Harvard Law School from 1989 to 2003, in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal on May 11, 2010.We're not big into he-said, she-said at PolitiFact, but we think a bit of point-counterpoint on Clark's statement is in order.During the confirmation hearing, Sen. Orrin Hatch cited a 2002 e-mail from an Air Force recruiter who wrote, ""Career Services Offices are the epicenter for all employer hiring activities at a law school. ... Without the support of the Career Services Office, we are relegated to wandering the halls in hopes that someone will stop and talk to us. ... Denying access to the Career Services Office is tantamount to chaining and locking the front door of the law school -- as it has the same impact on our recruiting efforts.""And a Feb. 18, 2005, letter from the Harvard Law School Veterans Association -- which was tapped by Kagan to coordinate military recruitment efforts in lieu of recruiters being afforded access to the Office of Career Services -- also suggests the 2005 policy was more than a seamless blip. The group lamented that ""Given our tiny membership, meager budget, and lack of any office space, we possess neither the time nor the resources to routinely schedule campus rooms or advertise extensively for outside organizations, as is the norm for most recruiting events."" Their effort, they wrote ""falls short of duplicating the excellent assistance provided by the HLS Office of Career Services."" And now the counterpoint. During the confirmation hearing, Sen. Patrick Leahy submitted a letter from First Lt. David M. Tressler, who is currently deployed with the U.S. Army Reserve in Afghanistan. Tressler graduated from Harvard Law School in 2006 and wrote that ""Military recruiters were never barred from campus. During the brief period when recruiters were not given access to students officially through the law school’s Office of Career Services, they still had access to students on campus through other means.""""There are only a few of us each year who joined the military while attending, or after graduation from, Harvard Law. Kagan’s decision to uphold the school’s anti-discrimination policy for a brief period of time and express disagreement with DADT did not prevent us from talking with recruiters and joining.""In fact, Tressler wrote, ""in 2005 more graduating students joined the military than any year this decade.""""To attack Ms. Kagan for a principled position she took as a law school dean that had no practical effect on military recruitment looks, from where I stand, like a political distraction,"" Tressler wrote. ""I believe that, while dean of Harvard Law School, she adequately proved her support for those who had served, were currently serving, and all those who felt called to serve, including those like me who joined upon graduation as well as those patriots who were not permitted to do so under the policy of 'Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.'""So how did all this affect the number of military recruits?We contacted the Harvard Law School Office of Public Information, which provided a breakdown on the number of graduates, by class, who went into the military: 2000 -- 02001 -- 32002 -- 22003 -- 22004 -- 32005 -- 52006 -- 32007 -- 32008 -- 22009 -- 2That's right, it went from three in 2004 to five in 2005. So Kagan is technically accurate that during the year in question, 2005, the number of recruits went up. And Tressler is correct that the five law school graduates who went into the military that year is the largest number from any class this decade. But by citing the statistic (without the numbers), Kagan suggests it backs the contention that her decision to bar recruiters from the Office of Career Services during the spring semester of 2005 had negligible, and perhaps only a symbolic, effect on military recruiting at Harvard Law School. That's a matter of dispute. While the former dean and a 2006 graduate now in the military say the policy had little real effect on recruiting, military recruiters clearly disagreed. The number of recruits in any given year at Harvard Law School is so small, we don't think citing the 2005 increase - by 2 from the previous year - settles the issue one way or the other. And so we rate Kagan's claim Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/30/elena-kagan/kagan-says-height-military-recuitment-controversy-/

Chafee says expanding R.I. sales tax could raise $89.3 million
","Former U.S. Sen. Lincoln Chafee shook up the political world in January when he called for a sales tax increase as part of his formal announcement of his candidacy for governor. Specifically, he proposed a  two-tiered sales tax in which exempt items, including food, clothing and over-the-counter drugs, would be taxed at 1 percent to help close the gap between state revenue and state spending. He outlines the plan on his website: ""Currently all exempt items total $8,936,785,714 in untaxed revenue. If we were to tax these items at 1% the state would receive an additional $89,376,857.  This money plus reforming the mandates on cities and towns and continuing to cut government spending could help us be the master of our economic destiny in this state.""Such specificity begs to be verified, so we decided to see whether Chafee’s numbers add up. Would Chafee’s plan raise what he promises? The most authoritative source of information on how much the state collects from the assorted taxes and fees it levies is the state Department of Revenue.In addition to monitoring what the state takes in, the department is also required to prepare a report every even-numbered year on how much revenue the state has relinquished by granting various tax exemptions.If the actual amount lost from particular exemptions can’t be determined precisely, the department, comes up with estimates, with varying degrees of reliability.The most recent report is for 2008, based on 2007 statistics. (Paul L. Dion, chief of the department’s office of revenue analysis, said the 2010 report is in its final stages.)The report said state law, in 2007, carved out 72 sales-tax exemptions. There are the well-known ones, such as food and clothing, and others such as coffins, aircraft parts, mobile homes and newspapers. Dion said more exemptions have been added since the last report; the 2010 report will have around 83. The best estimate is that those 72 exemptions cost the state $625,575,000 in lost revenue, assuming the transactions were taxed at 7 percent. And $625,575,000 is 7 percent of $8,936,785,714, the exact number the Chafee campaign cites on its website.  And if you taxed that at 1 percent, it would raise $89,376,857.     Dion said the Chafee campaign’s calculations are correct. But because many of the report’s figures are based on extrapolations, not hard data, real-world results may vary, Dion said. For example, the estimated $125-million cost for exempting food -- items “sold for ingestion or chewing by humans for their taste or nutritional value” -- is derived by updating a 1999 sales-tax model, not actual sales receipts.""Those are huge numbers,"" Dion said. ""You’ve got to use caution.""Chafee’s sales-tax math is accurate. But it’s based on numbers that even the people who compiled them say are less than reliable. For that reason, we rate Chafee’s projection Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2010/jun/30/lincoln-chafee/chafee-says-expanding-ri-sales-tax-could-raise-893/

Arizona Gov. Brewer says 'majority' of illegals are 'drug mules'
","Arizona Republican Gov. Jan Brewer created a frenzy in April 2010 when she signed a law that makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their status. Then in late June, she linked illegal immigrants and drug smuggling.

The string of controversial comments began June 15, 2010, during a debate with three other candidates running for the Republican nomination for governor.

Republican candidate Matt Jette said that most people who cross illegally into Arizona are ""just trying to feed their families."" Brewer, according to the Arizona Republic, disputed that, saying, ""They're coming here, and they're bringing drugs. And they're doing drop houses, and they're extorting people and they're terrorizing the families.""

A few days later, on June 25, Brewer expanded upon her comments during a question-and-answer session with reporters. (A verbatim account of the exchange is available here.)

""Well, we all know that the majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules,"" Brewer said. ""They're coming across our borders in huge numbers. The drug cartels have taken control of the immigration. … So they are criminals. They're breaking the law when they are trespassing and they're criminals when they pack the marijuana and the drugs on their backs.""

Brewer added, ""I believe today and in the circumstances that we are facing, that the majority of the illegal trespassers that are coming in the state of Arizona are under the direction and control of organized drug cartels, and they are bringing drugs in.""

Finally, later the same day, Brewer released a statement clarifying her comments for a second time.

""There has been some media attention in the last several hours regarding statements I made this morning regarding the level of drug and crime activity being perpetrated by illegal immigrants coming into and residing in Arizona. The simple truth is that the majority of human smuggling in our state is under the direction of the drug cartels, which are by definition smuggling drugs,"" the statement said.

""It is common knowledge that Mexican drug cartels have merged human smuggling with drug trafficking. For example, the Los Angeles Times on March 23, 2009, reported, 'The business of smuggling humans across the Mexican border has been brisk, with many thousands coming across every year. But smugglers affiliated with the drug cartels have taken the enterprise to a new level – and made it more violent – by commandeering much of the operation from independent coyotes, according to these officials and recent congressional testimonies.' This article and many federal government reports have drawn the same conclusions.

""The human rights violations that have taken place victimizing immigrants and their families are abhorrent. Border crossers are used by drug cartels as commodities. Mexican drug cartels have merged human smugglers who use their expertise in gathering intelligence on border patrols, logistics and communication devices to get around even tighter controls. U.S. border officials have stated that traffickers are gaining control of much of the illegal passage of immigrants from Mexico to the United States.""

Though Brewer did not use her written statement to retract any of her prior comments, she did change her focus a bit, singling out the criminal elements running joint drug-and-human smuggling operations rather than the immigrants that the cartels have been, in her words, ""victimizing.""

Whether or not this represents a backpedaling, we thought her earlier comments deserve scrutiny because they raise an interesting question -- whether there is a substantial connection between illegal immigrants and drug smuggling. So we talked to experts and looked over statistical data to see whether Brewer was justified in claiming that ""the majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules.""
 
The governor's staff did not respond to PolitiFact's request for comment, nor did Customs and Border Protection. But most of the experts we spoke to agreed with the notion, raised in the Los Angeles Times article and by Brewer, that there is growing overlap between drug smuggling and human smuggling.

""Because of the militarization of the border and the increased difficulty in crossing, most border-crossers turn to 'coyotes,' "" or human smugglers, said Aarti Kohli, the director of immigration policy and legislative counsel for the Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute on Race, Ethnicity, and Diversity at the University of California (Berkeley) School of Law. ""Sometimes these coyotes have links with drug cartels and are engaging in drug smuggling along with alien smuggling. Both are federal offenses.""

That said, Kohli and others draw a clear distinction with Brewer's suggestion that the majority of illegal border crossers are ""drug mules.""

""If caught along the southwest border, the vast majority of migrants are prosecuted in federal district court, often 70 at a time, for misdemeanor illegal entry,"" Kohli said. ""If they are caught smuggling drugs, they would not be prosecuted"" in this way.

Federal statistics bear this out. We looked at the latest available statistics, covering March 2010, for prosecutions stemming from immigrations and customs activities by the Department of Homeland Security. They show that ""immigration"" charges accounted for almost 89 percent of cases, while drug and drug-trafficking charges accounted for just over 5 percent.

""These apprehensions do not catch everyone, obviously, but as the Border Patrol is particularly interested in interdicting contraband, I don't know of any strong reason to believe that the Border Patrol's arrests would have a disproportionately low share of smugglers,"" said Gabriel ""Jack"" Chin, a professor of law, public administration and policy at the University of Arizona.

The statistics also track with accounts of law enforcement sources.

""Based on conversations with front-line Border Patrol agents, it is clear that the majority of people encountered by the Border Patrol are not carrying drugs,"" said T.J. Bonner, president of the National Border Patrol Council. ""While it is true that the majority of human smuggling is controlled or at least regulated by the cartels, it does not logically follow that the majority of people who are smuggled by the cartels are therefore transporting drugs. The penalties for transporting drugs are far greater than the penalties for entering the country illegally, so people do not engage in that type of criminal behavior unless they are so inclined, are extremely desperate or are coerced by the cartels. The two latter categories are the exceptions rather than the rule.""

On the broader issue, it's worth noting that statistics have consistently shown that immigrants, including illegal immigrants, actually have lower rates of criminal activity and incarceration than do the native-born children of immigrants. Rubén G. Rumbaut, a sociologist at the University of California (Irvine), has written that 2000 Census figures show consistently lower incarceration rates for foreign-born Mexicans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Colombians, Ecuadorians and Peruvians when compared to incarceration rates of U.S.-born members of the same ethnic groups. While the category ""foreign-born"" is not identical to ""illegal immigrant,"" there is significant overlap in these particular ethnic groups, Rumbaut writes.

Ultimately, Brewer would have been on safe ground if she'd said that drug smuggling and human smuggling have become increasingly intertwined, and that sometimes, illegal immigrants have been coerced into serving as drug couriers. But that's a much more limited claim than what she initially said -- that ""the majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules."" While the source she eventually cited -- the Los Angeles Times -- says that ""sometimes (smugglers) loaded up their human cargo with backpacks full of marijuana,"" the article doesn't back up her assertion that that ""the majority"" of illegal immigrants carry drugs into the country. More to the point, Brewer's contention is undercut by both federal prosecution statistics and the accounts of experts we spoke to. So we rate Brewer's statement False.",/factchecks/2010/jun/30/jan-brewer/arizona-gov-brewer-says-majority-illegals-are-drug/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Census', 'Elections', 'Race and Ethnicity', 'Texas', 'John Faulk']","
Faulk says center-city Houston congressional district has more Anglos than blacks
","John Faulk, the Republican challenging 8th-term U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston, recently hinted that changing demographics give him a leg up in his campaign to unseat the African American Democrat. Saying he has a “secret weapon,” the semi-retired accountant told delegates to the Republican state convention June 12 that his foe's district has been “gentrified” and has “more Anglos than African Americans.”  Really? Jackson Lee represents the 18th congressional district, which takes in center-city Houston and a partial ring of outlying neighborhoods.  To our initial inquiry, Faulk cited the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey for 2008, posted online, which says about 42 percent of the district’s residents that year were white and 38 percent were black. The bureau’s chart doesn’t use the Anglo descriptive Faulk employed at the convention. Following Faulk’s lead, we looked into the district’s past racial mix. In 2000, according to that year's census, the district was home then to 263,371 residents identified as black and 240,745 residents recorded as white. So from 2000 to 2008, it looks like there was a swing toward more white than black residents. Enough said? Maybe not. Jackson Lee’s campaign didn’t respond. But Ed Martin, an Austin Democratic consultant, pointed out that according to the '08 census survey, 41.5 percent of the district’s residents were Hispanic, a reflection, Martin nudged, on the estimate of white residents including many Hispanic residents. That is, the three largest population groups broke down to 38 percent black, 26 percent Hispanic white and 16 percent non-Hispanic white.  “African American voters control the district,” Martin said. Could Faulk’s sense of district demographics reflect recent election surprises? It looks like Democrats continue to dominate. In 2002, the first statewide election after the district was redrawn based on 2000 census results, all but one Democrat running statewide drew more than 72 percent of the district’s vote, according to the Texas Legislative Council. In 2008, the most recent statewide election, Democratic candidates -- from the president down the ballot to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals -- drew 75 percent or more of the vote. Next, we asked Lloyd Potter, the state demographer and director of the Institute for Demograhic and Socioeconomic Research at the University of Texas-San Antonio, to weigh the population analyses by Faulk and Martin. Potter said both are correct. Come again? Potter said that white-versus-black is just one way to gauge a population's makeup. At his suggestion, we delved into the bureau’s '08 estimates for the district by clicking on a “show more” hyperlink leading more information about the district's Hispanics. Six in 10 are identified as white; a relatively small percentage are of multiracial heritage such as black or Native-American. Add non-Hispanic whites to Hispanic whites, and the estimated white total (285,634) outnumbers blacks by 12 percent. But remove Hispanic whites from the white total, and the 255,856 black non-Hispanics outnumber the 109,461 white non-Hispanics by 135 percent. Faulk didn’t respond to our efforts to visit afresh; we don’t know if he shook the numbers this way. We asked Potter if any voter analysis of a congressional district would be expected to weigh the district’s share of Hispanic residents. Sure, he replied -- especially in Texas, where the growing share of Latinos can affect elections. And while Potter said it’s still correct to say the overall share of white residents exceeded the share of black residents according to the 2008 census estimate, he added that “some people might be misled . . .because they don’t understand that (the estimate of) whites includes Hispanics.” We’d wager it’s safe to lump most Texans (including us, until now) in that camp.  Finally, we probed Faulk’s statement the district has undergone gentrification, which according to Merriam-Webster’s online dictionary means “renewal and rebuilding accompanying the influx of middle-class or affluent people into deteriorating areas that often displaces poorer residents.” For the 18th district, we presumed, such an influx would be accompanied by significant increases in income over the decade. There’s been no surge, census research suggests. The 2000 census concluded the district’s median household income was $31,291 in 1999. Adjusted for inflation, that amount would have been about $40,000 in 2008. But the 2008 census survey pegged the district’s median household income for that year at $37,133--effectively less than what it had been nine years earlier. In 1999, about 20 percent of district families lived below the federal poverty level, according to the 2000 census. In 2008, 21 percent of families lived below that level, according to the 2008 census survey. All told, Faulk quoted a portion of the '08 census survey that could lead someone to conclude the district's whites outnumber blacks, signaling a boon for any GOP candidate given that minority voters usually favor Democrats. But that conclusion overlooks the fact that Hispanics -- who are also minority voters -- comprise the majority of white residents. Also, the census data yielded no evidence, such as higher incomes, of significant gentrification. Faulk's statement is False.",/factchecks/2010/jun/30/john-faulk/faulk-says-center-city-houston-congressional-distr/
"['Georgia', 'Environment', 'Vernon Jones']","
Jones says he helped turn ""trash into cash.""
","This one had us wondering.Vernon Jones, a Democratic candidate for Georgia's 4th Congressional District, discussed his environmental credentials at a recent candidate forum. He pointed to a program created during his days as DeKalb County's chief executive officer. In July 2005, the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners approved Jones' plan to convert methane gas into electricity from one of its landfills and sell it to Georgia Power.""I have a record on the environment of creating green energy by capturing methane gas at our landfills and selling it to Georgia Power and they in return selling it back as green energy -- taking trash and turning it into cash,"" Jones told the audience at the June 3 candidate forum in southeast Atlanta.It's been five years since the county government signed on with Georgia Power. So we decided to take a look at the initiative and see how it's working out. Is DeKalb, as Jones claimed, ""taking trash and turning it into cash""?First, a brief explanation on how this works. Landfill gas is largely composed of methane and carbon dioxide. By burning gas in boilers, Georgia Power can produce steam for power generation, according to its Web site. The company said the landfills can produce as many as 8 megawatts of electric power, enough to power eight Super Wal-Marts. More than 500 agencies across the nation have similar programs. DeKalb is doing it at the Seminole landfill, located near the county's southern edge.The environment is a big issue for Jones, who was CEO from 2001 through 2008. Jones won several awards for his efforts to preserve more green space in the county, primarily through a $125 million bond referendum that voters approved in 2001.Jones is also hoping to capitalize on a major concern in Georgia -- unemployment. His campaign slogan is ""Jobs First,"" and Jones is trying to convince voters that some of his economic development efforts, like the gas to energy program, are reasons why they should give him a shot in Washington. The state's unemployment rate in May was 10.2 percent. It was 9.5 percent a year earlier.In 2006, the county built a facility to convert the gas to electricity at a cost of $5.3 million. DeKalb has since spent $1.6 million on maintenance and operations, county spokeswoman Angela Walton said.And how much has DeKalb collected from the program? Walton said $3.9 million thus far. DeKalb projects it will collect nearly $1.1 million this year and slightly more in 2011.Some environmental protection groups, such as the Sierra Club, dispute the potential profit margin for DeKalb and other facilities that convert gas to electricity. They said the operating costs will eventually exceed profits when governments spend more money to pay for the environmental impact of methane -- which has high global warming potential -- leaking during the conversion process. (The Sierra Club said a higher percentage of methane leaks into the atmosphere when you convert gas to electricity.) The Sierra Club's board of directors voted last year to oppose the creation of any new landfill gas-to-energy facilities.""Methane is a dangerous gas that needs to be controlled,"" said Mark Woodall, the Sierra Club's Georgia chapter chairman. ""It doesn't need to be regarded as the answer to all renewable energy needs.""For the record, the Sierra Club has endorsed the incumbent congressman, Hank Johnson, in this race. Since 2006, DeKalb has spent about $6.9 million on the gas-to-electricity program. It has collected $3.9 million in revenue in that time span, with an estimated $2.1 million on the way in the next two years.Most business ventures have start-up costs, and DeKalb had some in this project. The revenue is on pace to soon exceed the start-up costs and expenses. DeKalb is, Jones said, converting ""trash into cash.""

"['National', 'Campaign Finance', 'Elections', 'Kagan Nomination', 'Jeff Sessions']","
Sen. Jeff Sessions says Kagan argued government could ban political pamphlets
","In the Supreme court nomination hearings for Elena Kagan, Republicans quickly zeroed in on Kagan's first oral arguments before the Supreme Court as solicitor general in the landmark case Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission, which dealt with corporate financing of political materials. Taking the first crack in his opening statement was Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee: ""In her first appellate argument, Ms. Kagan told the court that the speech and press guarantees in the First Amendment would allow the federal government to ban the publication of pamphlets discussing political issues before an election. ""I would remind my colleagues that the American revolution was in no small part spurred by just such political pamphlets: Thomas Paine's Common Sense."" To suggest that the government now has the power to suppress that kind of speech is breathtaking."" Sessions' comment does get to the heart of the controversy surrounding the government's position on the case, but Sessions paints the substance of those arguments with a very broad brush and ignores the limits of the legal questions involved. The case before the Supreme Court challenged the application of a campaign reform bill known as the McCain-Feingold Act with respect to whether the nonprofit corporation Citizens United could air a video critical of then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. In a broader sense, though, the issue was whether the government had the authority to ban corporate or labor union funding of independent political broadcasts advocating for a candidate just prior to an election. In her oral arguments before the Supreme Court, Kagan argued that pamphlets were ""pretty classic electioneering,"" and therefore fell into the category of corporate-financed election materials that could be limited by the McCain-Feingold Act. Now, corporations could still form separate political action committees (PACs) to get their message out. But Kagan said she argued in favor of the position taken by Congress that corporations and labor unions had such a ""corrupting influence"" on elections that they should not be allowed to directly fund political messages for or against a particular candidate very close to an election. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court went the other way, arguing that the First Amendment protects the speech of corporations and individuals alike. In his concurring opinion, Justice John Roberts wrote that the government's position ""asks us to embrace a theory of the First Amendment that would allow censorship not only of television and radio broadcasts, but of pamphlets, posters, the Internet, and virtually any other medium that corporations and unions might find useful in expressing their views on matters of public concern."" So, right off the bat, we are talking about pamphlets directly funded by corporations or labor unions. That's a big qualifier left out of Sessions' comment. And Sessions' point is further muddled when he drops in the example of Thomas Paine's pamphlet Common Sense, -- which in 1776 argued for American independence from British rule. Paine's 48-page pamphlet was not corporate-financed, so it's technically not applicable in this discussion. And it might not have been even if it was. ""Solicitor Kagan was arguing that, under the Federal Election Campaign Act, corporate funds could not be used to publish a pamphlet that expressly advocated the election or defeat of a specific candidate for federal office,"" said Brett Kappel, an attorney specializing in ethics and lobbying law at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Arent Fox. ""The Act would not have prevented Thomas Paine from publishing Common Sense since that famous pamphlet had nothing to do with candidates running for office. Today it would be considered an issue ad, not an electioneering communication."" The Federal Election Commission doesn't regulate advertising unless it includes the name or image of a candidate for federal office, Kappel noted. Others argue that whether Common Sense was technically not corporate-financed is not the issue. ""Common Sense itself was probably not published by a corporation, but in today's world, it surely would have been,"" said Bradley A. Smith, Professor of Law at Capital University Law School. ""How many such efforts can you name that are not?"" The statement by Sessions ""was a bit of rhetorical excess, perhaps,"" said Sean Parnell, president of the Center for Competitive Politics, a campaign-finance advocacy group. Obviously, he said, Sessions could have added a good bit of context. Kagan never argued that the government could ban any pamphlet. Nonetheless, Parnell said, in the context of limited corporate-financed political messages, Sessions' comment accurately described Kagan's position that in addition to a video, the government could ban a pamphlet. During some close questioning by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, on the Citizens United issue on the second day of the confirmation hearing, Kagan quickly framed the limits of the issue, stating that the statute ''applies only to corporations and unions when they make independent expenditures, not to their PACs ... within a certain period of an election."" She also noted that as solicitor general, she was defending the statute as written by Congress, which ""made the determination broadly that corporations and trade unions had this corrupting influence on Congress."" ""And the statute as it was written applies to pamphlets as well as to the movie in the case, and we made a vigorous argument that the application of that statute to any kind of classic electioneering materials, not books -- because they aren't typically used to electioneer -- but that the application of the statutes to any kinds of classic electioneering materials was in fact constitutional and that the court should defer to Congress' view of the need for this,"" Kagan said. Given the time constraints on opening statements, we are willing to allow Sessions a bit of rhetorical leeway.  Kagan did argue that pamphlets should be included in the types of communication the government could prohibit. But again, that's in the context of pamphlets paid for directly by corporations or labor unions making independent expenditures (not through their PAC) for a pamphlet advocating for a specific candidate within the last months of an election. That's an awful lot of limiting context left out. And the point is further muddled by using the example of Paine's Common Sense. It's not at all clear that that pamphlet would have fallen under the regulation of the McCain-Feingold Act. And so we rate Sessions' comment Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/29/jeff-sessions/sessions-says-kagan-argued-government-could-ban-po/

Greene no green card expert
","Arizona's recent unveiling of a hard-line immigration law designed to identify and detain undocumented immigrants has sparked a national conversation about what role the federal government should play in addressing the millions of illegal immigrants who call the United States home.In many ways, Republicans have dominated the debate with renewed calls for effective border security and streamlined deportation procedures.But, that's not to say Democrats have been silent on the issue.U.S. Senate contender Jeff Greene echoed a favorite party line in a June 22, 2010, Democratic primary debate when he ruminated over the hurdles faced by would-be immigrants looking to legally work in the United States. Business-savvy immigrants, in particular, need help navigating convoluted immigrant laws, Greene said. ""We have that program where immigrants come here and they have to bring a million dollars in order to get a green card if they’re going to create jobs,"" he lamented. ""But you know what? If an immigrant comes here and they’re willing to create jobs and they’re willing to contribute to our economy, we have to make it easier for the kinds of immigrants we want, because that is the past of America, that’s our greatness, and that will continue to be our greatness in the future."" Whether immigration contributes to America's greatness is a matter of opinion, but Greene's million-dollar statement caught our attention.We wondered, what does a green card go for these days?To be sure, so-called ""green cards"" are the key to legal life for immigrants in the United States. They are permanent resident cards that serve as evidence that the owner has the right to live and work here. Green card recipients can also petition for visas for other immigrants. There are multiple paths to obtaining a green card.The most common starting point for a green card is an employment visa submitted by immigrants who want to legally work in the United States. Other popular applications allow family members to petition for visas for foreign relatives, or allow refugees to seek humanitarian visas.Other than application fees, most immigrants don't have to put up a large amount of cash to obtain a visa, but they do have to show they will have a job or someone to provide for them.""The reason is to avoid immigrants from becoming dependent on government assistance,"" said Sharon Scheidhauer, a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokeswoman.Each process carries a different base filing fee, which can range from $355 for a petition for a relative and $1,435 for a petition by an entrepreneur. Greene singled out the entrepreneur visa in his comments, so we will here, as well.The EB-5 Immigrant Investor visa can open doors, but it is not cheap. Congress created the application process in 1990 to lure foreign millionaires. Recipients must invest $1 million in a U.S. business that benefits the economy and creates at least 10 full-time jobs, excluding employment for the visa applicant or the applicant's immediate family. If the investment is made in a targeted employment area, defined as a rural area or an area experiencing unusually high unemployment, the financial requirement drops to $500,000. The applicant must be involved in the daily management of the business and provide evidence that the investment funds were obtained through lawful means. Despite the many requirements, the investor visa remains an attractive alternative to the traditional green card process, said David Abraham, a University of Miami School of Law professor.""Those applying as employment visa immigrants must prove that they have a real and good job available that no American can/will fill,"" Abraham said. But, ""if they have money to invest in a job-creating way, there is practically no wait."" Roughly 1,028 immigrants applied for the investor visa last year. Most -- 966 in all -- were approved. The investor visa, however, does not immediately yield a green card. Instead, successful applicants are granted conditional residency for two years. After that period, they can apply to have the conditions removed if all requirements have been met.""Then they become a lawful permanent resident -- otherwise known as a green card holder,"" said Scheidhauer. Greene's campaign reiterated his criticism of the investor program.""Jeff was making the argument that we should change the provisions of the EB-5 visa so that rather than requiring prospective immigrants to bring cash into the country, we should favor those who plan to come and start companies, and extend their visas once they begin hiring American residents,"" said spokesman Luis Vizcaino.But it is worth noting that investor visa recipients don't enjoy exclusive rights to job creation. Temporary residents and permanent residents alike can legally start a business and hire workers in the United States. So, there is some truth to Greene's statement. There is a program where immigrants can funnel $1 million into the U.S. economy in exchange for some legal rights. But successful applicants do not immediately receive a green card as a reward for their investment. And, contrary to Greene's assertion, immigrants don't ""have"" to participate in this exchange. They can obtain either a visa or a green card through other avenues that would also allow them to create jobs.We rate this claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/29/jeff-greene/greene-no-green-card-expert/
"['National', 'Kagan Nomination', 'Supreme Court', 'Elena Kagan']","
Elena Kagan's law review article said Supreme Court nominees should be forthcoming
","We knew a flip flop might be coming after reading Elena Kagan's 1995 law review article on public hearings for nominees to the United States Supreme Court. Writing 15 years ago, Kagan wrote that the typical confirmation hearing was ""a vapid and hollow charade."" Too often, Kagan wrote, nominees were cagey and uncommunicative about their views, and senators seemed to accept that evasiveness with a shrug. ""When the Senate ceases to engage nominees in meaningful discussion of legal issues, the confirmation process takes on an air of vacuity and farce, and the Senate becomes incapable of either properly evaluating nominees or appropriately educating the public,"" Kagan wrote. ""Such hearings serve little educative function, except perhaps to reinforce lessons of cynicism that citizens often glean from government,"" she added. ""Neither can such hearings contribute toward an evaluation of the Court and a determination whether the nominee would make it a better or worse institution. A process so empty may seem ever so tidy -- muted, polite, and restrained -- but all that good order comes at great cost."" Kagan's article was a book review of The Confirmation Mess, by Stephen L. Carter. Carter's book dissected the Supreme Court nomination and hearings of Robert Bork, a legal scholar and judge nominated to the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. After contentious hearings in which Democrats excoriated Bork's conservative views, the senate rejected his nomination on a 42-58 vote. In the review, Kagan writes that the Bork hearings may have been contentious, but the nominee's actual testimony was serious and substantive. ""The Bork hearings presented to the public a serious discussion of the meaning of the Constitution, the role of the Court, and the views of the nominee; that discussion at once educated the public and allowed it to determine whether the nominee would move the Court in the proper direction,"" she wrote. Nominees shouldn't say how they would rule on a specific case, but ""a nominee can say a great, great deal before making a statement that, under this standard, nears the improper. A nominee, as I have indicated before, usually can comment on judicial methodology, on prior case law, on hypothetical cases, on general issues like affirmative action or abortion."" At the time Kagan wrote her review, she was a law professor at the University of Chicago, and had served a short stint as special counsel to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, primarily to provide guidance on President Bill Clinton's nomination of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993. (The committee chair was then-Sen. Joe Biden.) Speaking at her own confirmation hearing, Kagan said some of that review wasn't quite right. ""I do think much of what I wrote in 1995 was right, but in some measure I got a bit of the balance off,"" she said. What she got right back then, she said, was that it was inappropriate for a nominee to indicate how he or she might vote in a specific case. But now she realized that there are other types of questions about previous cases or judicial philosophy that could give hints to how a justice would vote in the future. ""I skewed it too much toward saying that answering is appropriate even when it would, you know, provide some kind of hints,"" she added. ""And I think that that was wrong. I think that, in particular, that it wouldn't be appropriate for me to talk about what I think about past cases -- you know, to grade cases -- because those cases themselves might again come before the court."" We should note that senators from both parties asked Kagan about the book review and her thoughts on how candid nominees should be. Sen. Herb. Kohl, D-Wisc., noted that Kagan wrote it was a fair question to ask a nominee in what direction she would move the court. Kagan answered simply, ""Well, it might be a fair question."" Left unsaid was the possibility that she might not answer, a response that drew laughter from the audience. Kagan also declined to answer other questions during the course of the hearing, such as when Kohl also asked her to comment on the Supreme Court case Bush v. Gore, which pushed the disputed 2000 election to a conclusion. Kohl specifically noted that the case would not come before the court again, and asked her if the Supreme Court should have gotten involved in the case in the first place. Rather than saying plainly that she wouldn't answer, Kagan evaded the question by saying she thought the court might consider the type of question again. ""And if it did, I would try to consider it in an appropriate way, reading the briefs and listening to the arguments and talking with my colleagues,"" she said. ""I think it is an important question, and a difficult question, about how an election contest that at least, arguably, the political branches can't find a way to resolve themselves, what should happen, and whether and when the court should get involved. It's hard to think of a more important question in a democratic system, and maybe a tougher one."" In ruling on this statement, we find that Kagan herself has walked back her previous position on how much Supreme Court nominees can and should comment during nomination hearings. She indicated she would not be answering questions that she had previously said were not only permissible but desirable. So we rate her position a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2010/jun/29/elena-kagan/elena-kagan-law-review-article-said-supreme-court/

David Jolly gave 'almost $30,000 to keep Democrats in Congress' as a lobbyist, Kathleen Peters says
","Republican 13th Congressional District candidate David Jolly’s past as a Washington lobbyist was always a sure bet to be a bone of contention for rivals in the campaign for the late C.W. Bill Young’s open seat. Kathleen Peters is more than happy to oblige. In a mailer sent to voters, Peters’ campaign declares, ""Since 2007, David Jolly has given almost $30,000 to keep Democrats in Congress!"" It then adds ""(But not a dime to Congressman Bill Young)"" before launching into a number of bullet points about how Jolly has supported his rival party. Lobbyists typically work both sides of the aisle in Congress depending on who can help their causes the most. We wanted to know if the mailer was telling the full story. Time to dig into the public record. Mr. Jolly goes to Washington The mailer doesn’t say it, but Dunedin native David Jolly worked for Young for several years. Jolly has played up his connection to Young, for whom he worked full time from 1995 to 2006. Jolly held various positions, with a brief break in 2001 when he took six months off to work at a Washington securities firm. In 2002, Young named Jolly his general counsel, a position Jolly held through 2006.   In 2007, Jolly began work as a lobbyist with Washington firm Van Scoyoc Associates. Eventually, he opened his own firm, Three Bridges Advisors. Jolly officially took his name off the Lobby Registry in order to run for the vacant House seat. Peters has spent a lot of time making hay over Jolly’s past as a lobbyist, illustrating why it is so difficult for a lobbyist to run for office (leaving office to become a lobbyist is nowhere near as difficult -- or as uncommon). Her mailer says, ""In the past three election cycles, Washington Lobbyist David Jolly has made nearly $30,000 in personal contributions to the campaigns of Democrats in Congress -- liberals who have forced Obamacare on America and have fought responsible Republican policies."" The flier then lists 13 ""Jolly Good"" Democratic senators and representatives to whom Jolly has given campaign contributions. Among the baker’s dozen are Florida’s own Sen. Bill Nelson (who received $4,500 in direct contributions and through his PAC, Moving America Forward), Rep. Kathy Castor ($3,600) and former Rep. Allen Boyd ($7,500). Boyd, who was defeated for re-election by Republican Steve Southerland in 2010, is now a lobbyist for the Twenty-First Century Group. The list also includes other Democrats from around the nation, including Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin ($1,000), late Hawaii Sen. Daniel Inouye ($1,000), Maine Rep. Mike Michaud ($2,250) and former Illinois Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. ($2,300), who was sentenced in August to 30 months in prison for wire and mail fraud for using campaign contributions for personal expenses. The total listed on the mailing was $28,622, a number PolitiFact Florida confirmed through Federal Elections Commission filings from 2007 to 2013. What the mailer doesn’t mention is that Jolly also gave thousands to Republicans. Some noteworthy recipients include Rep. Gus Bilirakis ($9,350), Rep. Dennis Ross ($4,104), Rep. Richard Nugent ($4,629), Arizona Sen. John McCain’s presidential campaign ($2,300) and former Florida Sen. Mel Martinez ($1,500). Jolly also gave then-Republican Gov. Charlie Crist $500 during his failed Senate bid. In all, Jolly the lobbyist gave more than $34,000 to Republican politicians, candidates and organizations over the past six years. Jolly has maintained that paying both Democrats and Republicans is the cost of doing business as a lobbyist. ""My giving has always followed my personal relationships,"" he told PolitiFact Florida. He said in the case of Democrats, the contributions were for candidates and Congress members in races that weren’t close and had defense and national security priorities that matched his own. It’s been noted in coverage of the 13th Congressional District race as well as the mailing in question that Jolly hadn’t given any money to Young, which Jolly confirms is true. But it wasn’t for a lack of trying, he said. ""I actually gave him money, and he did not accept it,"" Jolly added, repeating a favored anecdote about Young literally tearing up the check. He said he often worked to get money for Young by organizing host committees for fundraisers. Our ruling Peters’ mailer said Jolly ""has given almost $30,000 to keep Democrats in Congress"" in the form of campaign contributions. The total on the flier, which we confirmed and Jolly did not dispute, is $28,622. That sounds like almost $30,000 to us. But Jolly has given even more to Republicans, and he was a staff member to Young for several years.   The statement is accurate but needs clarification.

David Jolly says Kathleen Peters won’t 'take a stand' to repeal Obamacare
","The 13th U.S. Congressional District race is heating up ahead of the Jan. 14 Republican primary, with front-running candidates David Jolly and state Rep. Kathleen Peters taking swipes at each other in mailings and TV commercials. In the first flier we saw attacking Peters, David Jolly’s campaign paints the state representative from South Pasadena as being compliant with the Affordable Care Act. It shows Peters and Democratic challenger Alex Sink in a photo collage with President Barack Obama, with the words, ""It’s Pinellas County’s worst nightmare! … Keeping Obamacare!"" The mailing quotes Peters saying, ""I do not think we should take a stand and say absolutely repeal it."" In a Republican primary, the attack that a politician is pro-Obamacare -- or even just Obamacare-tolerant -- can be potent. We wanted to know if the flier is accurate in saying that Peters ""refuses to ‘take a stand’ to repeal Obamacare."" The magic word Peters has been a state representative since 2012 for House District 69, which includes Treasure Island, South Pasadena and Gulfport. We couldn’t find any public comments from Peters on the Affordable Care Act before she decided to run for the late C.W. Bill Young’s open U.S. House seat. At a Suncoast Tiger Bay Club forum in St. Petersburg on Dec. 6,  Peters fielded a question from an audience member who asked what her position to improve health care was. ""What I can tell you is that I don’t like the plan that we currently have to take care of affordable health care. And I don’t even think they named it appropriately, and I think it’s one of those wolves in sheep’s clothing when they call it the Affordable Care Act, because it is not at all affordable,"" Peters answered. ""I do not think that we should take a stand and say absolutely repeal it. Not unless we have a plan and a proposal to replace it."" She added she didn’t think pre-existing conditions should be a factor in obtaining insurance, and gave an anecdote about how she had previously had difficulties with insurance companies after a surgery. ""Is it a problem? Yes, we have to address it,"" she concluded. ""But we can’t just repeal it, we have to have a comprehensive plan ... something that’s affordable, that isn’t mandating down and forces people to not have choices."" Jolly, who has been very vocal in his opposition to the law, has said he is using the flier as ""a contrast piece,"" to illustrate how he wants to repeal the law and Peters doesn’t. The quote he chose, however, doesn’t include much context or any indication of Peters’ other talking points about Obamacare. Peters previously told the Tampa Bay Times she didn’t believe ""this affordable care act is truly affordable,"" but didn’t change her message that some portions of the law -- such as not denying coverage to patients -- were worth keeping. ""I don't think we can just go back to the way it was,"" she said. This point of view seems to largely fall in line with many Americans. A Gallup poll released on Dec. 6 found that only 30 percent of respondents wanted it gone entirely. The rest wanted to law kept, scaled back or expanded. We should note, though, that when the results are broken down by party affiliation, 68 percent of Republicans favor repeal. Peters seemed to change the tack of her arguments immediately after the flier was mailed out, posting a message on Facebook dealing with Jolly’s implications. She began clearly stating she supported repeal of Obamacare. ""David Jolly is shamelessly attempting to tie Alex Sink’s support of this law with my position,"" she wrote. ""I want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but at the same time, we have to have a viable option to replace the law.""    She has since solidified her position, saying during a Dec. 19 press conference that she supports the repeal of Obamacare. ""I want to be very clear, I support full repeal of Obamacare,"" she said. ""Jolly has misrepresented me on this issue."" She also told PolitiFact Florida via email she is seeking to replace the law ""with free-market based solutions"" and added ""there are several Republican alternatives that I am currently reviewing to cosponsor in the future."" Her view seems to square with national Republicans who have advocated a ""repeal and replace"" strategy since 2010. Our ruling Jolly wanted to portray Peters as soft on Obamacare, in an attempt to win over conservative voters. His use of Peters’ quote, ""I do not think we should take a stand and say absolutely repeal it"" without context is designed to appeal to voters who want the law taken off the books entirely. Peters has repeatedly said she doesn’t support the law, but doesn’t feel it would be good policy to simply strip the Affordable Care Act off the books without addressing some of the problems in the health care system. Her stance lacked specifics before the mailing came out, but it was always clear she wasn’t a staunch Obamacare advocate. She repeatedly said or implied the law should go, so long as some provisions could be retained, such as helping people with pre-existing conditions get insurance. The mailer attempts to make it appear as if she supports the law, which she didn’t do even before clarifying her message. We rate this statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/dec/27/david-jolly/david-jolly-says-kathleen-peters-wont-take-stand-r/
"['Elections', 'Women', 'Texas', 'Gilberto Hinojosa']","
Two women running for top state offices isn't unusual, though a November pair of Davis, Van de Putte would be
","The chairman of the Texas Democratic Party declared in a December email blast soliciting contributions that the Texas party is making history. ""This is the first time in Texas history -- and only the fourth time in United States history -- that two women are running for the top spots,"" Gilberto Hinojosa said. He was referring to the Democratic state senators who have filed to run in 2014 for governor (Wendy Davis of Fort Worth) and lieutenant governor (Leticia Van de Putte of San Antonio). Is this the first time that Democratic women have sought these offices in the same year? No, we quickly found. In 2010, San Antonio physician Alma Ludivina Aguado unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for governor, losing in the party primary, and Linda Chavez-Thompson was the party's pick for lieutenant governor. But what about women seeking the top office in a general election? Since Davis has a little-known opponent in the March 2014 primary,  Reynaldo ""Ray"" Madrigal, and Van de Putte is unopposed, it's likely that both Davis and Van de Putte will both be nominated and appear back to back, so to speak, on the November 2014 general-election ballot. A party spokesman, Emmanuel Garcia, said by phone that this is what Hinojosa was underscoring. A party spokeswoman, Ada Ortega, told us that Hinojosa’s first/fourth declaration was rooted in a Nov. 23, 2013, Associated Press news article on Van de Putte declaring her candidacy for lieutenant governor. The AP story hinted at the expectation that Democrats will nominate Davis and Van de Putte, stating: ""It is the first time in Texas history women have led a major party's ticket for the state's top offices, and only the fourth time in U.S. history."" By email, the reporter who wrote the story, Austin-based Will Weissert, told us he drew that conclusion based on a July 26, 2013, press release from the New Jersey-based Center for American Women and Politics. That release said that just twice before, in Illinois in 1994 and Kentucky in 1999, major-party tickets were led by two women. At the time of the release, the third instance was about to be New Jersey state Sen. Barbara Buono running for governor with union executive Milly Silva as her lieutenant governor running mate, the release said. (The pair lost in a November 2013 landslide to Republican Gov. Chris Christie and his running mate, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno.) In 1994, the center said, Illinois Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dawn Clark Netsch chose state Sen. Penny Severns as her running mate. In 1999, Kentucky Republican gubernatorial candidate Peppy Martin ran with a Taylor County school board member. Both tickets lost. By telephone, the center’s director, Debbie Walsh, stressed that in the three previous instances, the nominees ran together as a ticket. Texas doesn't do it that way; the Texas governor and lieutenant governor each stand election on their own. Walsh, who said the center has collected information on women running for office since its 1971 launch, said the center did not look into how often, if at all, two women simultaneously sought to be nominated in a primary for a state’s top two offices. At our request, the center searched for such instances since 2000, which Walsh said was the earliest year for which information across the states was easily accessed. Walsh then emailed us a chart indicating that two women or more have run in primaries for governor and lieutenant governor in Alabama, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas (as noted above) and Wisconsin. All told, Walsh said, if Davis and Van de Putte win their respective nominations, the two will be the nation’s fourth all-female top-of-the-ticket in November. By phone, party spokesman Garcia said Hinojosa could have clarified that he was referring to the historic significance of Davis and Van de Putte as November nominees. After we published this article, the Associated Press noted in a Jan. 1, 2014, news article that in Arizona in 1998, women captured the five top state offices. According to Arizona’s Nov. 23, 1998, canvass of that voting, the victors were: Republicans Jane Dee Hull, governor, and Betsey Bayless, secretary of state; Democrat Janet Napolitano, attorney general; and Republicans Carol Springer, state treasurer, and Lisa Graham Keegan, superintendent of public instruction. Then again, Arizona has no lieutenant governor. Voters in 2010 rejected a proposal to create the office. Our ruling Hinojosa said: ""This is the first time in Texas history -- and only the fourth time in United States history -- that two women are running for the top spots."" Hinojosa is entirely correct in reference to general elections nationally only if the 1998 victories of two Arizona Republicans are not considered. But two or more women have sought to be nominated for a state’s top elected positions more than 20 times since 2000. We rate this partly accurate claim as Half True. UPDATE, 4:30 p.m., Jan. 3, 2014: We updated this article to note that in 1998, women ran and won the top state offices in Arizona. This change did not affect our initial rating.

"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Poverty', 'Workers', 'PunditFact', 'Teresa Ghilarducci']","
Economist Teresa Ghilarducci says a quarter of U.S. workers earn $18,000 or less
","Amid growing debate about whether to raise the nation’s $7.25 minimum wage, Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist with the New School in New York City, offered a statistic that sought to gauge how many American workers are poor. ""We are No. 1 in the world in creating low-wage jobs,"" Ghilarducci said on the Dec. 15, 2013, edition of the MSNBC show Up. ""One out of four workers in the United States is a low-wage worker, meaning that they make 45 percent of the median wage, which is now $18,000 per year. So a quarter of our workers make $18,000 per year. And no other industrialized country has that kind of record."" We wondered if she was correct that ""a quarter of our workers make $18,000 per year."" We found data from the U.S. Census Bureau that addresses the question. The Census data The Census Bureau data breaks down wage and salaried workers by ranges of income, from ""$1 to $2,499"" to ""$100,000 and up."" The data shows that 148.3 million Americans age 15 and up earned some wage or salary income in 2012. Of these workers, 33.5 million earned $17,500 or less. But to square it with Ghilarducci’s income ranges, we need to adjust upwards a bit to account for those earning between $17,500 and $18,000. This adjustment makes the number approximately 35 million. If you divide these 35 million low-income workers by the total 148.3 million workers, the result is 24 percent -- right on target for Ghilarducci’s claim. Some caveats However, we’ll note a few important bits of context. • Part-time workers. As it turns out, the bulk of these 35 million low-income workers -- 23.5 million, or about two-thirds -- worked part time. Now, some percentage of these 23.5 million workers -- perhaps a large percentage, given the slow economic recovery -- is working part time because they want a full-time job but can’t find one. But others may prefer working part time, such as students or parents of young children. When we contacted Ghilarducci, she agreed that this was an issue and forwarded recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggesting that about one-third of part time workers are doing so because they can’t find an acceptable full-time job, while two-thirds are working for non-economic reasons. This suggests that it’s wrong to assume that all, or even most, part-time workers are doing so because of the poor economy. • Partial-year workers. The Census data also tracks how much of the year workers spent on the job. The data shows that 14.8 million people who earned less than $18,000 worked 26 weeks or less. In other words, 42 percent of all workers earning under $18,000 worked for half the year or less. They might have earned well above that if they’d been paid at that rate for the full year. This offers another reminder that it’s wrong to view Ghilarducci’s statistic as suggesting that one-quarter of all workers with a full-time, full-year job are making $18,000 or less. An alternative number So let’s take a look at just the workers who had a full-time job and worked all year. The Census data shows that 98.3 million workers had full-time jobs for the whole year. Of those, about 8.8 million earned $18,000 or less -- just shy of 9 percent. Is this a better number? Not necessarily -- both have merit, and both are imperfect. Ghilarducci’s one-quarter overestimates the number of low-income workers because it includes Americans working part-time voluntarily, or who, by choice or not, may have worked for only for a part of the year. At the same time, the alternative number -- 9 percent -- does the reverse, underestimating the number of low-income workers by not including Americans who are working part-time jobs when they would actually like to have a full-time job. Ghilarducci thanked PunditFact for checking up on her work. ""It is important for yakkers on TV to footnote!"" she said. ""I think I will change my behavior and not give interviews without a follow up with footnotes of my own. So you saved me work. Thank you."" Our ruling Ghilarducci said that ""a quarter of our workers make $18,000 per year."" Census data backs up this top-line number, but beneath the surface, there are reasons for caution. The number she cites does not refer exclusively to full-year, full-time jobs. Rather, it includes lots of people who had a low income because they worked in a part-time job, or worked for just part of the year. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2013/dec/23/teresa-ghilarducci/economist-teresa-ghilarducci-says-quarter-us-worke/

Gov. Scott Walker says protesters surrounded his car, blocked his exit and rocked the vehicle after a 2011 appearance in La Crosse
","The title of Gov. Scott Walker’s new book is ""Unintimidated."" So, it makes sense that it would be filled with details about how he stood up against his opponents. The book describes death threats against the governor and his family, protests outside the governor’s residence and -- of course -- the massive protests at the Capitol in Madison in the wake of Walker’s move in early 2011 to curtail collective bargaining for most public employees. One of the incidents has stood out, both for PolitiFact Wisconsin readers who have asked us to look into it and for those who have interviewed Walker as he has made the rounds promoting his book -- a face-to-face meeting with ""hundreds of angry protesters"" after a Feb. 15, 2011, appearance at a La Crosse factory. Here is how Walker describes it in the book: ""As we prepared to leave, the state troopers saw that the protesters had physically blocked the entrance we had used to come onto the property. So they turned the squad car around and headed toward the other exit. We watched in disbelief as the throng of people rushed toward the second exit to block our path. As we tried to pull out, they surrounded the car and began beating on the windows and rocking the vehicle. ""Just as we extricated ourselves from their grip, a truck pulled up and blocked our path, playing a game of chicken with the troopers. They turned the lights and sirens on and warned him to get out of the way. Eventually he backed up, and we sped off. ""It was a lesson in how much our circumstance had changed in a matter of a few days. We were dealing with people who were so blinded by their anger that they were not in the least bit afraid to storm and shake a police car. We had never seen anything like it in Wisconsin before."" Walker goes on to say that the incident, among others, prompted the addition of security officers and procedures for him and his family. The La Crosse visit underscores a central theme of his book that he stood up against increasingly aggressive protests. To be sure, it has been documented that Walker received death threats, including against his family, and emotions on both sides were high as Senate Democrats fled to Illinois to block a vote and Republicans maneuvered to pass the measure. Walker critics, meanwhile, have largely argued that protests were orderly and a straightforward exercise in democratic action. The most common refrain: ""This is what democracy looks like."" This item is not meant to settle that disagreement, but to look at one incident that keeps getting mentioned in the national media. One example, from a Nov. 23, 2013 appearance on the ""700 Club"" show hosted by conservative talk show host Pat Robertson: Robertson: ""They were banging on your car. You were in danger of your life -- is that the way it was?"" Walker: ""Oh, it was; no doubt about it. We, at one point, coming out of a manufacturing business in La Crosse where they were literally shaking one of our squad cars that the State Patrol was in with me."" So, is Walker right? Did protesters in La Crosse surrounded a State Patrol car carrying him and beat and rock the vehicle? Did a truck block the exit so they could not leave? The situation at the time  The La Crosse incident came days after Walker surprised the state with his proposal to curb collective bargaining. The visit -- like the large protests in Madison and in other cities that Walker visited -- received considerable media coverage. That coverage from the time is a good starting point and one we will give extra weight. Why? News coverage or a document generated at the time -- say a police incident report or an internal email -- is less likely to be skewed by spin or memories. It is more likely to be accurate than a recollection from years later, particularly one that may well have been put into writing by another person entirely. In this case, Walker’s co-author, Mark Thiessen. As written, the incident is about more than angry protesters. It depicts an organized effort to prevent Walker from leaving -- one exit is blocked by the crowd, the windows ""beaten"" as the car is ""rocked."" Once ""extricated,"" the car turns toward another exit which is immediately blocked by a truck ""playing a game of chicken"" with state troopers. The crowd rushes there as well. This does not describe an orderly protest. It describes chaos. Indeed, if an incident like this happened, it almost certainly would have been widely covered. At the time, both sides were actively portraying the other as extreme and unreasonable. Any incidents by protesters, in particular, became a talking point on conservative blogs and talk radio. We searched for details about the La Crosse story, specifically that protesters blocked and rocked the car in which Walker was riding, and found nothing. We could not locate any news report from the time that indicated Walker himself was physically threatened in such a way. We turned to Walker spokesman Tom Evenson and asked for details about what happened that day. He referred all questions to the book’s publisher, Penguin Group. Penguin spokeswoman Jacquelynn Burke offered a one sentence response: ""The Wisconsin State Patrol confirms that this event took place."" When we turned to the State Patrol, they didn’t offer much more detail. ""I did connect with somebody in our dignitary protection unit and they were able to confirm for me that there was an incident,"" said Peg Schmitt, a spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation, which includes the State Patrol. We asked for any reports related to the incident, a copy of any dash-cam video, or for interviews with the troopers or staff involved. Anything with details. Schmitt said there was no formal report filed, and that no further information about the incident would be made public. The State Patrol viewed what happened in La Crosse as a routine incident, she said, adding the most important concern was ""moving the governor to safety."" She said no interviews or additional information would be provided because it could compromise the State Patrol’s ability to provide security in the future. What was reported at the time Looking for more information about the nature of the car incident, we turned to those involved in La Crosse, including local police, executives with the company Walker visited, the news media, and those involved in the protest. Walker’s visit was covered by the La Crosse Tribune in a story published the following day. The story noted that hundreds of protesters lined the street leading to Ted Mannstedt & Son, a structural steel manufacturer that employs about 25 people. ""Chants of ‘Hey hey, ho ho, Walker’s got to go’ bled through the walls"" and could be heard inside the company, the story said. The story included coverage of Walker’s speech, quoted protesters and included a photo of Walker’s car with protesters in the background. There was no mention of any altercation involving the car. La Crosse Tribune editor Chris Hardie said reporter Chris Hubbuch and photographer Peter Thomson covered Walker’s visit and watched his car leave the plant. ""Both Chris and Peter were standing outside when the governor left,"" Hardie said. ""Neither of them remembers any kind of car rocking or the car being surrounded, that kind of thing."" The journalists reviewed a Google satellite view of the property and refreshed their memories about where they were standing in relation to Walker’s car, Hardie said. ""They would have noticed if they were blocking and beating on his car,"" Hardie said. He noted, too, that the journalists would have also been alerted if they had seen flashing police lights or heard a siren from Walker’s car -- something else the governor described. They witnessed nothing of the sort. The view from La Crosse police The La Crosse Police Department had officers at the scene because the crowd had grown to several hundred and was in the street and on private property. ""We were assisting by blocking off the streets and so forth,"" said Officer Lisa Barrix, department spokeswoman. She said there was no record of misbehavior by the crowd, including interfering with the car during Walker’s departure, and no arrests. No mention, either, of a truck blocking an exit. ""There was nothing out of control,"" Barrix  said. ""We don’t have any record of any type of disturbance that I can locate."" Two officials with the company, including owner Brad Mannstedt, recalled a large, noisy crowd. ""There was at least a good 500 people on the street,"" said Mannstedt. He said protesters moved toward Walker’s car as he was leaving, and said it was possible some got close enough to swat at the vehicle with rolled up posters. ""I don’t think there was any real malicious attempt to get at him. They were trying to get his attention,"" Mannstedt said. ""It’s as if you were to take a newspaper, roll it up and slam it on your desk to get somebody’s attention."" Bob Sandvick, a quality control supervisor at the firm, said he was paying close attention to the crowd to make sure the protesters did not trespass onto company property. Asked if he knew anything about protesters surrounding Walker’s car, he said ""I’m not aware of that."" Ward Keil of Onalaska, who was in the crowd, said the ""mood of the crowd was a little belligerent."" People screamed at cars that they believed were carrying Walker, but didn’t do anything more aggressive than that, he said. Also, he said, it seemed that authorities used a ""dummy car"" so protesters didn’t know which car the governor was in. Finally, local television news coverage of the governor’s visit included a video snippet of the governor’s car leaving the plant. The crowd is several feet away from the car, and the car pulls out of the parking lot and turns onto the street without pausing. There’s no evidence of a truck blocking the way. More from the Walker side We circled back to Walker’s office and asked to interview staff members or anyone else with first-hand knowledge of the incident. Former Walker communications director Chris Schrimpf, in an email, offered a description similar to that in the book. ""I remember the day well because the hatred on the protesters' faces as they banged on the car and shook it was jarring.  I remember they ran toward the car like an angry mob (because they were one), we were blocked by the other car, and we were stuck."" Schrimpf declined to be interviewed about what happened. When pressed on what other evidence he could provide, Schrimpf pointed to a change in how travel around the state for media appearances was handled. He said that after the La Crosse visit, Walker stopped traveling by car. Instead, they flew and did appearances in airplane hangars. Walker’s schedule confirms the switch to air travel. That switch may be evidence the La Crosse visit signaled issues that required a security change, but the switch alone is not confirmation of the specifics as described by Walker and supported by his former aide. Remember: We are not checking whether Walker -- and Schrimpf -- were startled by the protesters, or even if they were frightened by them. Or whether the State Patrol was ready for what it encountered that day. We are looking at whether the exits were blocked and the car rocked.  We are examining the words used in the book, ones that depict a direct and physical threat to the governor of Wisconsin and disregard for state troopers and local authorities. Walker gives an updated view With the story in the news, Patrick Anderson, a reporter for the Tribune, asked Walker about the incident when the governor appeared Dec. 6, 2013, in La Crosse for a bill signing. Walker described it this way: ""As we came out, literally tons of the, a whole bunch of the protesters ran down to the other exit and got out in front of the exit and literally blocked the car and got around the car and were kind of banging on the sides,"" Walker said, according to a transcript of the interview  the newspaper provided to PolitiFact Wisconsin. That’s pretty close to the language in the book, but then things start to differ a bit. In the book, Walker describes lights and sirens and the truck blocking the way. In the interview, he said a state trooper in the squad ""rolled the window down and said pretty sternly, you need to move back from the car."" Asked about being afraid (Robertson, in the TV interview, phrased it as being ""in danger of your life"", a statement Walker agreed with), Walker said: ""I was concerned. It was, it was something that I had never experienced before. I don’t know if afraid is the right word but it certainly was jarring, is probably the better word than fear."" Asked about the car rocking, Walker said: ""Yeah they shook a little bit. ...signs were banging and that."" The governor also addressed the police report question. ""Of course there’s no police report. No tickets were issued, no arrests were made. The whole use of the (dignitary protection unit) … is that if you’re in a situation like that you get out. … The last thing you want to do is heighten it. But it was a pretty big wake up call."" Our rating Walker says protesters in La Crosse blocked an exit and surrounded a State Patrol car carrying the governor and were ""beating on the windows and rocking the vehicle."" When the car was ""extricated"" from the crowd, a truck blocked a second exit.   Yet we could find no mention of the car rocking incident before the book came out Nov. 19, 2013. Beyond the book itself and related public statements, there was no concrete evidence provided by Walker’s office, despite numerous inquiries by PolitiFact.   Local police, journalists at the scene, and people from the company and the crowd do not recall seeing Walker’s car rocked or banged upon. And no one involved in news coverage, local law enforcement or witnesses reported seeing a truck blocking the car from leaving. Finally, in a recent interview, Walker toned down his description of the incident.  Based on the available information, we think the book’s depiction of what happened -- an organized effort to prevent Walker from leaving that placed him in direct danger -- is False.

George Will says 'most' of health care law has been waived or suspended
","President Barack Obama announced last week that people who had their health insurance canceled can now purchase a bare bones plan that only covers major medical expenses without facing the threat of a fine. It’s a significant change for some, and one of several ways the administration has altered some provisions of the law. How much tinkering has gone on? Fox political commentator George Will offered this analysis on Fox News Sunday. ""At this point, it’s very hard to quantify, (but) perhaps most of the law has already in some sense been waived or otherwise suspended,"" Will said. ""The president said this week that the suspensions of the employer mandate, the individual mandate, etc., etc., etc., do not go to the core of the law. If not that, what is the core of the law?"" For this fact-check, we will take a stab at quantifying the steps the law set out to do so we can determine if, as Will said, most of the law has been waived or suspended. Delays and modifications There have been a number of modest administrative changes, including giving people an extra week to sign-up for coverage to begin in January and giving insurance companies an extra month at the end of next year to set premiums. There have also been some significant alterations. This summer, Obama delayed by a year a requirement that all companies with 50 or more employees provide their workers health care coverage. And in the fall, when a wave of cancellation notices appeared in the mailboxes of Americans who bought coverage directly from insurance companies, Obama gave states the option to let people stay on those plans through next year -- even though the plans did not meet the standards of the Affordable Care Act. In some ways, the move this week was a way to supplement that relief for people who wanted more options. Comparing head counts Of all the changes, the most recent one seems likely to touch the most lives. Obama said his staff estimated that about 500,000 people might want a high-deductible, catastrophic plan. We have seen credible estimates that about 4 million people saw their plans canceled but some have now found replacement coverage. In reality, we won’t know the full scope of this policy shift for several months. The next-biggest impact stems from the delay in the employer mandate. Analysts with the RAND Corporation, a respected, independent research group, recently estimated that about 300,000 fewer people would have coverage as a result. While these figures are only estimates, they show that the changes -- while perhaps significant -- affect only a small portion of people in the health insurance market. About 365,000 people purchased insurance through the federal marketplace through November and another 800,000 were found eligible for Medicaid, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Obama said another 500,000 people had signed up for health insurance in December. Other parts of the law are affecting many more Americans. The law added about 3.1 million young adults to their parent’s health care plans. A requirement that insurance companies spend at least 80 percent of every premium dollar on actual health care affected the health care policies of about 77 million people in 2012, according to government figures. That resulted in about $3.4 billion in rebates, coverage adjustments or policy enhancements. Starting in 2011, the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit became more generous. More than 35 million people participate in that program. Looking at the individual mandate, the Urban Institute, a Washington academic policy group, estimated that it would hit about 18 million people. That dwarfs the 500,000 the administration believes will take advantage of the catastrophic coverage option. Our ruling With all the talk about problems with the health care law, it’s easy to forget just how many corners of health insurance policy the law affects. Will seemed guilty of that on Fox News Sunday when he said most of the law has been waived or suspended. Obama has made at least two major course corrections in the law. He delayed the employer mandate by one year and allowed individuals dealing with canceled plans to buy insurance that fails to meet minimum standards under the law. One way to put these changes into context is to look at the number of people they affect. While precise data are missing, the combined impact could be in the range of 1 million Americans. On the other side of the ledger, 3.1 million young adults have gained access to coverage through the law, another 18 million people are subject to the individual mandate and millions more have benefited from requirements that health insurance companies spend premiums on care. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/dec/22/george-will/george-will-says-most-health-care-law-has-been-wai/

Was Barack Obama against wiretapping before he was for it?
","Pundits got their turn Sunday to weigh in on the news of the week regarding the National Security Agency’s once-secret surveillance programs, dissecting recommendations to restrict the program from an advisory panel and a ruling from a federal judge that the phone data collection program is likely unconstitutional. Was the news of the week a validation of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, an obvious affirmation of Americans’ privacy rights? On ABC’s This Week, conservative pundit Bill Kristol seemed to downplay the events of the week, calling the judge’s ruling an outlier. ""I don’t agree with all the stuff, ‘Thank God for Edward Snowden, we wouldn’t be having this debate.’ We had a big debate in Congress on this in 2006, 2007, and in fact we passed legislation in 2007. We had a big debate about this, President (Barack) Obama discussed this. President Obama is a constitutional law professor, he came into office very concerned about the terrible ..."" ABC political analyst Matthew Dowd jumped in as Kristol spoke to say Obama’s performance in this area is ""exceedingly disappointing."" ""I’m sorry, then he became president of the United States,"" Kristol replied. ""He got all the briefings, he saw seriously what was going on, and basically he decided, I think, correctly, that you know what, the balance is probably pretty appropriately struck. Now he’s shifting ... entirely because of optics."" PunditFact wanted to know if Kristol is correct about Obama’s evolution on government spying programs. Obama in the Senate In his early years in the Senate, Obama was a reliable critic of the post-Sept. 11 surveillance efforts launched by President George W. Bush. In 2005, the New York Times exposed a Bush executive order allowing the National Security Agency to tap Americans’ international phone calls and emails in effort to track terrorists without seeking search warrants from the courts. The Times reported the agency was still seeking warrants for monitoring domestic communications. As the Senate voted to reauthorize the Patriot Act that same week, Obama decried the administration’s ""fishing expedition"" of Americans’ everyday electronic records in a floor speech: ""This is just plain wrong. ... Giving law enforcement the tools they need to investigate suspicious activity is one thing – and it’s the right thing – but doing it without any real oversight seriously jeopardizes the rights of all Americans and the ideals America stands for."" In a 2006 speech explaining why he would vote against confirming Michael Hayden as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 2006, Obama said: ""We don’t expect the president to give the American people every detail about a classified surveillance program. But we do expect him to place such a program within the rule of law, and to allow members of the other two co-equal branches of government — Congress and the Judiciary — to have the ability to monitor and oversee such a program."" And: ""We need to find a way forward to make sure that we can stop terrorists while protecting the privacy, and liberty, of innocent Americans. As a nation we have to find the right balance between privacy and security, between executive authority to face threats and uncontrolled power. What protects us, and what distinguishes us, are the procedures we put in place to protect that balance, namely judicial warrants and congressional review. ... These are concrete safeguards to make sure surveillance hasn’t gone too far."" Obama as a candidate for president Fast forward to 2007. Obama is running for president -- and still criticizing Bush for operating without enough oversight. He said the Bush administration ""puts forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we provide."" According to the Des Moines Register (via National Review Online), he said, ""When I am president, there will be no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens. No more national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime. No more tracking citizens who do nothing more than protest a misguided war."" The next year, however, he faced charges of flip-flopping on warrantless wiretapping by his Republican rival, Sen. John McCain. At issue was legislation in 2008 that rewrote the rules of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the 1978 law that lays out rules for spying in the country and created a secret court of judges to oversee it. Congress amended the law amid backlash. One of the most controversial questions was whether to grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that had turned over network data to the government, as the companies were vulnerable to lawsuits following the Times exposé. Obama’s campaign said he would oppose a bill that provided retroactive immunity for the companies. But he ended up joining 68 senators who voted for it, disappointing some on the left as well as advocates of civil liberties. The changes to FISA in 2008 essentially legalized warrantless wiretapping that had been going on, Molly Bishop Shadel, an expert in foreign intelligence law at the University of Virginia School of Law, previously told PunditFact. ""Congress expanded the scope of FISA even though it knew or should have known that the NSA had done something questionable,"" she said. Obama defended his vote to supporters by saying the new law includes checks and balances that weren’t in place before. ""Senator Obama has said before that the compromise bill is not perfect,"" his campaign said in a statement at the time. ""Given the choice between voting for an improved yet imperfect bill, and losing important surveillance tools, Senator Obama chose to support the FISA compromise."" Obama explained the bill ""is far better than the Protect America Act that I voted against last year... (because it) makes it clear to any president or telecommunications company that no law supersedes the authority of the FISA court."" Still, PolitiFact rated McCain’s claim that Obama flip-flopped after promising to filibuster a bill that provided retroactive immunity to the telecommunications companies as True. Obama as president No substantial legislative oversight has been added to the Patriot Act since Obama took over the White House. Obama signed a five-year extension of the FISA Amendments Act in December 2012. The Senate rejected amendments that would have required intelligence agencies to report more information about their work to Congress. Following Snowden’s revelations, Obama defended two surveillance programs using some of the language Kristol mentioned. ""You can't have 100 percent security and also have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience. We're going to have to make some choices as a government,"" Obama said. ""You can complain about Big Brother and how this is a potential program run amok, but when you actually look at the details, I think we've struck the right balance."" We’ll close by looking at Obama’s performance on campaign promises on this subject, including his promise to update the FISA law so there is greater congressional oversight and his promise to ""revisit the Patriot Act to ensure that there is real and robust oversight of tools like National Security letters, sneak-and-peek searches, and the use of the material witness provision."" Obama said he would restrict warrantless wiretapping by strengthening intelligence agencies’ accountability to Congress, which is rated Compromise. Obama signed a reauthorization of the Patriot Act in 2011 that did not include more oversight, though his Justice Department did voluntarily move to add additional measures included in a bill that failed in the Senate. Obama also promised to ""revisit the Patriot Act to ensure that there is real and robust oversight of tools like National Security Letters, sneak-and-peek searches, and the use of the material witness provision,"" which PolitiFact also rated as a Compromise. Our ruling Kristol said Obama ""came into office very concerned about"" wiretappings but ""then he became president of the United States, he got all the briefings … (and) he decided … the balance is probably pretty appropriately struck."" That’s true, to a point. Obama’s concerns for Bush-era surveillance tactics have certainly dwindled since he took office -- and he has defended ongoing, recently exposed confidential surveillance programs. But Obama’s opinions shifted even before he moved into the White House. Most notably, he voted for a bill that essentially approved warrantless wiretapping in July 2008. The shift was so notable that his presidential rival at the time called him a flip-flopper.

Glenn Beck talks 'Duck Dynasty,' wedding vendors
","The airwaves are roaring with chatter about Phil Robertson of A&E’s popular show Duck Dynasty for comments he made about homosexuality in a GQ interview. With the future of the show in question, talking heads are either criticizing Robertson’s remarks as deeply offensive or, like radio host Glenn Beck, defending him on grounds of freedom of speech. If the country truly valued ""equality and diversity,"" Beck argued, Robertson would be allowed to express his opinion without being punished for it. He urged Robertson’s family not to back down and said his network, TheBlaze, would welcome them into the fold because they want ""diversity of thought."" ""If you think that it isn’t about anything but marriage and equality, you’re mistaken. It’s not about equality,"" Beck said. ""If it’s about equality and it’s about diversity, then you would allow people a different opinion. A different opinion. No, no, no, we don’t have different opinions now. ""You are forcing people in business to make wedding cakes,"" he said. ""If they say I don't want to serve you, I don't want to make a wedding cake for you, you must make a wedding cake. There's no diversity in that. That's fascism."" (this was all the same sequence) Beck’s wording is not explicit, but we think we know what he was referencing (his people did not get back to us). There have been a few recent legal battles involving wedding vendors who refuse to provide their services to same-sex couples on religious grounds. We wanted to investigate if people are forced to make wedding cakes against their will and what those cases mean more broadly. Colorado cake conundrum There are two high-profile cases of bakers citing Christian beliefs when they refused to provide wedding cakes for a gay couple who wanted to celebrate their marriage. We’ll focus on the one with a recent judge’s order. One summer day in 2012, a gay couple stopped inside Masterpiece Cakeshop in the Denver area seeking a wedding cake to celebrate their wedding in Massachusetts. The mom of one of the newlyweds joined the baker and the couple at a table to discuss their vision, though they never got a chance to bring it up. Once the owner learned what the wedding cake would be for, he told the would-be customers that preparing a cake for them would go against his Christian beliefs, according to court documents. He said, ""I’ll make you birthday cakes, shower cakes, sell you cookies and brownies, I just don’t make cakes for same-sex weddings."" The American Civil Liberties Union filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission on the couple’s behalf. A year and a half later on Dec. 6, 2013, administrative law judge Robert Spencer ruled in favor of the couple. Coloradans passed a constitutional ban on gay marriage but recently allowed civil unions. The civil union law allows religious groups and leaders to opt out of performing those ceremonies but does not include religious protections for business. More pertinent here, an administrative law judge noted, the state amended its public accommodation law to add ""sexual orientation"" as a protected class that cannot be discriminated against by businesses that are open to the public. Spencer said the cakeshop must ""cease and desist from discriminating"" against gay couples or face financial penalties for refusing to make wedding cakes for gay couples in the future. ""At first blush, it may seem reasonable that a private business should be able to refuse service to anyone it chooses,"" he wrote. ""This view, however, fails to take into account the cost to society and the hurt caused to persons who are denied service simply because of who they are."" The judge rejected the cakeshop’s argument that providing a cake for the couple would have conveyed support for their marriage, pointing out that he refused to serve them before they could dive into the details of what the cake would look like. The couple ""might have wanted a nondescript cake that would have been suitable for consumption at any wedding. ... The act of preparing a cake is simply not ‘speech’ warranting First Amendment protection,"" he wrote. If the cake shop defies the judge’s order, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission could seek court action that could include ""issuance of contempt citation, potential fines and imprisonment for offending the dignity of the court,"" a spokeswoman said. A spokesman for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian nonprofit that defended the baker in court and has taken up similar cases, said it would appeal the order but has not filed one (the 30-day window for an appeal closes in early January 2014). Other cases of religious liberty vs. public accommodation ADF spokesman Greg Scott said there are many more examples than just Masterpiece Cakeshop of ""government intrusion on conscience, in which an arm of the state tells you comply with the government-decreed morality or face the consequences."" Scott provided examples that go beyond wedding services, such as a Mennonite family that runs a manufacturing company and sued the Obama administration over its rules requiring employers to cover contraceptive care, including the morning-after pill. ""There’s more, but I think you get the idea,"" he said. ""It is becoming a nationwide problem."" In Oregon, a state investigation into a bakery refusing to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple remains open. Elsewhere, a Washington wedding florist was sued for refusing to provide floral arrangements for a gay couple’s wedding. The U.S. Supreme Court could decide on a discrimination complaint against a New Mexico-based wedding photographer who declined to photograph a lesbian couple’s commitment ceremony. The New Mexico Supreme Court ruled against the photographer, saying artistic services offered to the public are regulated by discrimination laws. Eugene Volokh, a UCLA School of Law professor who co-authored a brief in support of the photographer, said he does not think the Constitution permits the government to require photographers, painters or writers to ""create constitutionally protected speech."" (He said he does not think bakers have as strong a case because they are not as involved in the ceremony.) Douglas Laycock, a University of Virginia professor of law and religious studies, said he would be surprised if the U.S. Supreme Court takes up the photographer’s case. So what does it mean? Laws that protect customers from being discriminated against because of sexual orientation do not exist for the whole country. The ruling by the Colorado administrative law judge was limited to Colorado, and the same goes for other cases in other states so far. ""But really, I would say that the (Colorado) decision is just affirming a much broader, long-standing legal principle that religion doesn't give anyone a reason to discriminate,"" said Amanda Goad, an ACLU attorney involved in the Colorado baker’s case. Twenty-one states have public accommodation laws similar to the one in Colorado, including California, New York and Oregon, according to the Human Rights Campaign. That means clear protections do not exist in 29 states, such as Florida and Texas, though some cities have implemented their own ordinances, Goad said. The judicial decisions in New Mexico and Colorado show why those laws are important to supporters of gay rights, she said. ""If there’s no public accommodation law that covers sexual orientation, then no one has any obligation, religious or not, to serve anybody,"" Laycock said. ""The gay couples only have a claim if there is a law in place that gives them a claim."" Just because it isn’t happening in every state does not mean it is not happening, Volokh argued. ""You might say, well it is good that cake bakers are being required to prepare cakes for same-sex commitment ceremonies,"" he said. ""But if the claim is that cake bakers are being required to do this, that claim seems to be correct. And it seems likely that if more anti-discrimination laws are enacted, this will happen in more and more states."" Our ruling Incensed by A&E’s response to its opinionated Duck Dynasty star, Beck lamented the country’s lack of appreciation for ""diversity of thought,"" saying Robertson is entitled to say what he wants in accordance with his freedoms of speech and religion. Even wedding cake-makers are feeling the same pressure. ""If they say I don't want to serve you, I don't want to make a wedding cake for you, you must make a wedding cake,"" he said, just weeks after a Colorado administrative law judge said a Denver-area baker must ""cease and desist"" discriminating against gay couples who want wedding cakes or face fines. Indeed, that happened. Another investigation into a bakery that withheld a wedding cake is pending in Oregon. Beck did not get into details about either case on his show. But he should have clarified that many states do not have the same protections for sexual orientation in their public accommodation laws, so it’s less clear if businesses in those states could be compelled to make cake if they had personal objections. We rate this claim Mostly True. Correction: Douglas Laycock said the New Mexico case would be binding nationwide if it was taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court. An earlier version of this story was incorrect on this point.",/factchecks/2013/dec/22/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-talks-duck-dynasty-wedding-vendors/

Chris Christie claims 3 lanes off George Washington Bridge are dedicated to Fort Lee
","Hardly a day passes where vicious snarls don’t somehow tie up the George Washington Bridge. But those snarls aren’t limited to traffic. More and more, daily questions are arising from the September closure of some local-access lanes on the span. To date, they have resulted in the resignation of two high-ranking transportation officials and calls for a federal investigation into what’s become known as ‘Bridgegate.’ And none of the questions are going away quietly. Among the latest claims to enter the fray? One by Gov. Chris Christie, who complained earlier this month about the local-access lanes for Fort Lee, where the bridge is located. ""The fact that one town has three lanes dedicated to it, that kind of gets me sauced,"" Christie said Dec. 2 in response to Democratic lawmakers subpoenaing the director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- which operates the bridge -- to appear before a state Assembly committee about the lane closures from Sept. 9-13. The closures caused massive traffic jams in Fort Lee, leaving some drivers stranded for hours. Three lanes of a 29-lane span (12 lanes on the upper level, 10 on the lower level and seven from the Palisades Parkway) dedicated to a relatively small borough in Bergen County? The governor isn't even close to correct. Let’s look at some numbers here. The 2012 census notes that Fort Lee’s land area is 2.54 square miles and the borough’s population that year was 35,732. And not all of those people are drivers or even users of the bridge connecting upper Manhattan with the borough. So why the hullabaloo about bridge lanes and Fort Lee? It goes to the September closures, when two of three local-access lanes were closed, purportedly for a traffic study, according to Port Authority officials questioned about the closures. Some Democrats have questioned whether the closures were political retribution against Fort Lee’s Democratic mayor for failing to endorse Republican Gov. Chris Christie for re-election last month.. And the matter has continued to heat up. Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex), chairman of the Assembly Transportation, Public Works and Independent Authorities Committee, and an outspoken critic of the Port Authority, has convened hearings on the matter and issued subpoenas to Port Authority officials to testify about what happened. David Wildstein, the Port Authority’s director of interstate capital projects, who ordered the bridge’s general manager to carry out the closures, and agency Executive Director Bill Baroni have since resigned. On Dec. 10 the Port Authority’s inspector general launched an investigation into the closures and now U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, has asked the federal transportation secretary to investigate. Both Wisniewski and Sen. Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen) are dumbfounded by Christie’s claim that the local access lanes are dedicated to Fort Lee. ""These lanes are open to the general public,"" Wisniewski said. ""They’re physically located in Fort Lee but they’re not dedicated to Fort Lee. ""I think it’s the word ‘dedicated’ to Fort Lee that creates the problem here,"" Wisniewski added. ""There’s an access point at Fort Lee that people (who live there) use and that many other people use."" Wisniewski explained that use of the access lanes in Fort Lee is similar to drivers using the New Jersey Turnpike Extension, for example, to get to the Holland Tunnel connecting Manhattan and Jersey City. It’s one way of using the tunnel, but not the only way. And Weinberg, who lives near the bridge, noted that there is no residency requirement for the people of Fort Lee or anyone else to use the bridge. ""There are no specific dedicated lanes,"" she said. ""There are lanes that come from local streets in Fort Lee, but all lanes come through Fort Lee because the bridge is there. There are some local streets where you don’t have to get on the main highway."" Since neither Christie’s spokespeople, Port Authority spokespeople or even the Fort Lee Police Department would respond to requests for comment on the matter, the Truth-O-Meter went on the road last week to check out the local access lanes. We found that Wisniewski’s and Weinberg’s assessments are correct: there are lanes from local Fort Lee streets but none are dedicated specifically to the borough. Anyone can use them -- or not. Our ruling Earlier this month, in response to subpoenas being issued in the so-called ‘Bridgegate’ scandal, Christie said, ""The fact that one town has three lanes dedicated to it, that kind of gets me sauced."" Christie is way off here. Never mind that his claim makes it seem as if a significant part of the bridge’s total number of lanes are dedicated to a borough with a land area only 2.5 square miles in size, with approximately 35,000 residents. The facts are that the George Washington Bridge is physically in Fort Lee and there are local access lanes from the bridge. But none of the lanes are dedicated for use only in or by the borough. All motorists are able to use them as an entry point to the span. Know what gets the Truth-O-Meter sauced, governor? Ridiculously false claims. Pants on Fire!

"['Elections', 'Wisconsin', 'Mary Burke']","
Mary Burke says 70 percent of money contributed to Scott Walker comes from outside Wisconsin
","Gov. Scott Walker’s campaign had a healthy $2.2 million on hand at last count -- and that was after he dropped $2 million getting his 2014 re-election machine revved up. Mary Burke, the Madison Democrat challenging him, tries to use Walker’s state and national fundraising prowess against him as she courts donors for her campaign. ""Will I be out-fundraised? Yes,"" Burke told the Journal Sentinel Dec. 13, 2013, repeating a claim she has made on the campaign trail. She added: ""When Scott Walker raises nearly 70% of his money from out of state, that's going to be hard to beat. But what I feel is I'll be able to raise what I need to get the message out. My money is going to come largely from the people of Wisconsin."" Only time will tell if Burke gets the nomination and is outspent by Walker. She’s expected to tap her personal wealth. But we can take a look at her claim that Walker gets more than two-thirds of his campaign cash from outside Wisconsin. Did the governor, in the year after his recall election, still attract that level of interest from around the country? Different ways to count it Burke didn’t specify a time period for her claim, so there are different ways to look at it. For example, about 62 percent of Walker’s total fundraising from his first days as governor in January 2011 through the midway point of 2013 -- the most recent reporting period available -- came from out-of-state donors. Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki said she meant funds raised for the 2014 election cycle. That’s a logical way to frame it, given that Burke is jumping in during that cycle. Zepecki said Burke specifically meant funds raised after the recall election Walker won on June 5, 2012. She crunched the numbers herself using the database maintained by the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a widely used source on campaign fundraising. Of $4.8 million raised by Walker after June 5, 2012, 68 percent was from states other than Wisconsin, we found when using the Democracy Campaign data’s advanced search function. The data is current through June 30, 2013, when candidates last reported their fundraising to the state. So by that accounting Burke appears to be on target. But there is a problem with her analysis. The Democracy Campaign, when it issues its own reports, uses July 1, 2012 as the start date of the 2014 season. By that timeline, 59 percent of Walker’s individual receipts since then were from out of state. (Data note: The Democracy Campaign data omits some donors under $100, but that makes little difference in the bottom line.) There’s a second way to look at this, and it’s the official way described in state statutes. State law defines the recall period as extending to July 31, 2012. That July 31 marker recognizes the fact that campaigns don’t close the books on an election for several weeks or months after the polls close. Donations, for example, continue to come in, and bills must be paid. Walker booked more than $3 million in the eight weeks after the recall election, reflecting the tail end of the frenzied recall fundraising period. He booked more than 39,000 donations between June 6 and June 30 alone. Activity in his campaign accounts slowed to a trickle after July 31. So those late-June donations are pretty clearly related to the recall, and are officially considered so, but Burke’s timeframe includes them. And that makes a significant difference, because Walker’s recall fundraising was truly a national affair. Crunching our own numbers So to get the ""official"" number we crunched the numbers from Walker’s state campaign reports starting with donations after July 31, 2012. As part of this, we examined all individual donations instead of excluding those smaller than $100. Bottom line: We found of the $3.6 million Walker raised from the official post-recall start date of July 31 to June 30, 2013, some 56 percent was from out of state. So, still a solid majority from out of state, but not the two-thirds Burke claimed. There’s not a perfect way to do this, because Walker is free to carry over unspent recall funds and use them in the 2014 race. Walker raised money from every state in the period. Wisconsin was king, by far, followed by Texas, Illinois, Florida and California. His very largest donors are mostly from out of state ""While some candidates are able to turn to a vast personal fortune to fund their campaign, we rely on folks who believe in what we’re doing, and support us by contributing their hard-earned money,"" Walker campaign spokesman Jonathan Wetzel said when asked about out of state contributions. In the period, 75 percent of Walker’s contributors gave $50 or less. Burke will file her first six-month campaign report in late January 2014. Our rating Burke said that ""Scott Walker raises nearly 70 percent of his money from out of state."" By her layman’s definition of the 2014 campaign season, she’s on target. But the number drops to 56 percent if you use the official state definition of the 2014 cycle -- an approach that weeds out a mountain of recall-related donations from the analysis, as Burke’s campaign said she intended. We rate her claim Mostly False. To comment on this article, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.",/factchecks/2013/dec/22/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-70-percent-money-contributed-scott/

Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine says Rhode Island’s teen binge drinking rate is twice U.S. average
","Rhode Island was treated to an interesting do-the-ends-justify-the-means debate last week when the Washington, D.C.-based Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine criticized a research study by Rhode Island Hospital and Brown University that uses young pigs to study the effects of alcohol consumption on the heart. Besides objecting to the treatment of the animals involved, the committee argued that the money spent on such research could be better used elsewhere in the Ocean State. To drive that point home, the committee has begun an advertising campaign with posters on five Providence bus shelters, claiming ""Rhode Island’s teen binge drinking rate is double the national average. But Brown researchers are not helping teens. Instead, they are wasting federal funds on experiments giving alcohol to piglets."" We’ll pass on whether getting pigs drunk is a waste of federal money. But we wondered whether Rhode Island’s rate of teen binge drinking is that high. Two federal agencies that track teenage alcohol use, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, define binge drinking as having five or more drinks at the same occasion, at the same time or within a couple of hours. Physicians Committee spokeswoman Jeanne S. McVey said the group came up with its statistic by using data from two federal agencies that track, among other things, alcohol use by the nation’s teenagers. She cited a 2012 survey by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration that found that 7.2 percent of respondents aged 12 to 17 nationwide reported at least one instance of binge drinking over the previous 30 days. But that study didn’t break down its findings by state. For a Rhode Island number, McVey said, the committee turned to a 2013 survey by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Study, a survey of a cross section of the nation’s high school students, done every two years. According to documents posted on the state Health Department website, that survey found that in Rhode Island, 15.1 percent of responding students in grades 9 through 12 said they had at least one binge-drinking experience in the previous 30 days. Rhode Island’s 15.1 percent, as reported in the CDC study, is more than twice the national average of 7.2 percent, as reported in the SAMHSA study, McVey said. But those are numbers from two different studies. Is it legitimate to compare them in that way? No, said statistician Jeffrey E. Jarrett, a professor of finance decision science at the University of Rhode Island. To be valid, Jarrett said, comparisons must be drawn from the same data -- in other words, surveys that ask the same questions to the same people. Even a slight difference in wording between questionnaires can make a difference. ""The only way to compare is to compare things within the same study,"" he said. To get an apples-to-apples comparison, we returned to the CDC study. The agency has not yet compiled national averages for its 2013 study. But in its 2011 survey, the Rhode Island teen binge-drinking rate was 18.3 percent, compared with 21.9 percent for the nation as a whole. So the Rhode Island rate was actually less than the national one, not double. When we pointed out the flaws in the committee’s methodology, McVey acknowledged that the organization could have been more careful. ""We now see that we should have had an expert in statistics double check, because we were comparing one set of national statistics to one set of local statistics,"" McVey said. "" … If we were to do it over again, we would certainly word it differently."" ""Our larger point is true,"" she added. ""Federal funds should go to helping people rather than to animal experiments that often do not result in treatment for human patients."" Our ruling Regardless of your opinion on the larger point, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine sought to make it with an incorrect comparison. It claimed ""Rhode Island’s teen binge drinking rate is double the national average,"" deriving that claim by comparing numbers from two different surveys. But the most recent report that includes both national and state-by-state figures show that Rhode Island’s rate was actually less than the national average. We rule the claim False.

Wisconsin Democratic Party says Scott Walker was kicked out of student elections at Marquette University
","Some critics of Gov. Scott Walker have for years charged, insinuated or suggested that a dark story underlies his early departure from Marquette University in 1990. Such talk ramped up when Walker announced he was writing a book, ""Unintimidated,"" that was released in November 2013. ""The ‘Essence’ of Dirty Tricks: Dropping out at Marquette,"" read a headline on the Democratic Party of Wisconsin’s website. ""Scott Walker was kicked out of student elections at Marquette University after masterminding a scheme that destroyed newspapers critical of him,"" the party alleged on its website. ""Walker either dropped out or was forced out not long after."" Mike Tate, chairman of the state Democratic Party, told us the party based its post on unnamed sources who he said had privately passed on information about possible ""nefarious activity"" that Tate did not describe. Those parties would be reluctant to talk to a reporter, he said. The allegation is defensible, Tate argued, because the party is trying to raise questions about the ""mystery"" of Walker’s departure. That’s a flimsy case, at best. At worst, it suggests a possible fictional smear. It’s similar to claims by others that Walker got caught cheating and was kicked out, for which critics have offered no evidence. To research the various claims, and examine how Walker has shifted his own explanation over time, we examined volumes of university files on the election and other matters from the period, and spoke with Walker, his opponent in the student elections, and students, teachers and administrators -- Walker critics and backers alike. We reported the results of our investigation in a story published Dec. 18, 2013. That story provides a basis for this Truth-O-Meter item, which we decided to break out separately because of how often we are asked by readers to look at -- and rate -- this very claim. Here we’ll summarize some of our findings. Walker enrolled at Marquette in the fall of 1986, and left in spring 1990 with about a year’s worth of credits left to earn. He took a full-time job and was running for state Assembly at the time. In February 1988, as a sophomore, he entered a fiercely fought campaign for Marquette student government president against John Quigley, a liberal student from Chicago. The day before the election, the student-produced Marquette Tribune endorsed Quigley. The paper, though, also said Walker was qualified. That day’s newspaper became a limited edition, students told the Quigley campaign. They’d seen Walker workers and/or College Republicans emptying editions of the Tribune from racks in high-traffic buildings, according to Quigley. Administrators soon got involved in the dustup. Walker campaign officials denied involvement. Stung by the endorsement, Walker’s camp plastered campus with an election-eve flier criticizing Quigley’s political tactics. It was gentle stuff, but the Trib took offense, publishing an election-day editorial headlined, ""Walker unfit."" It decried his ""mudslinging"" and said another factor in its reversal on Walker being qualified was the alleged theft of papers. The next day’s vote wasn’t close; Quigley won 1,245 to 927. His tenure was short. Within months, Quigley was forced from office when senators threatened impeachment following his arrest at a sit-in protesting a university decision to displace low-income residents of the central YMCA to make room for Marquette dormitory space. Theft of newspapers alleged Quigley’s departure left an opening in spring 1989. But Walker sat it out and disappeared from the student government scene. An interesting turn of events, but a far cry from proof that Walker was barred from running. Overall, we turned up no proof that Walker was banned from elections. We did find evidence that the alleged newspaper confiscation got the attention of top university administrators, one of whom ordered an investigation. ""I have requested the Department of Public Safety to investigate the reported destruction/theft of a large number of Marquette Tribune newspapers on February 23, 1988,"" Dean of Students James E. Moore wrote to College Of Journalism Dean Sharon Murphy on May 9, 1988. ""If the inquiry indicates a conduct policy violation on the part of the identified individuals, a disciplinary process will be initiated."" We found no paper trail, and could not learn from interviews, what came of that investigation, if anything. Marquette officials told us that even if they once existed, records regarding disciplinary actions unrelated to academics are destroyed two years after a student or his/her class graduates, per the student handbook. Students who have completed a penalty for non-academic discipline are returned to good standing. Records of suspensions or expulsions are not destroyed, the handbook says. The bottom line: Details of the alleged purloining of the papers are not readily available in the public record, such as it is, much less evidence of who may have ""masterminded"" it. ""These allegations are false,"" Walker spokesman Tom Evenson told us. Quigley firmly agrees. ""I don’t believe any disciplinary action was taken against him for anything that happened in that election,"" said Quigley, who is now a Democratic political consultant. Marquette releases information Now let’s tackle the larger suggestion by the Democratic Party -- that Walker may have been forced out of the university altogether. In the course of our reporting, we heard nothing -- and found no evidence -- suggesting Walker was pushed out of the university. Publicly available documents cannot fully resolve the question, in part because a federal privacy law blocks release of information on former students unless the person consents. In addition, Walker told us he was sticking to an earlier decision not to release his transcript. With that in mind, we asked Walker if he would allow Marquette to comment on his academic and conduct record. He did. ""Gov. Scott Walker was a student at Marquette from fall of 1986 until spring 1990 and was a senior in good standing when he voluntarily withdrew from Marquette,"" the university said in a statement. That means that no conduct issues, academic or otherwise, blocked Walker from continuing in school at the time of his departure, MU spokesman Brian Dorrington told us in early December 2013. When we asked Dorrington whether any conduct issues were on Walker’s earlier school record, he said Walker would have to permit release of that information. Walker did so in response to our request. ""Governor Walker was in good standing each term while he was enrolled at Marquette University and when he left Marquette University,"" Associate Vice Provost Anne Deahl said in a letter. ""Governor Walker was not expelled or suspended from the university at any time."" That statement provides the strongest refutation to date of accusations that Walker was forced out. Finally, there’s another problem with the Democratic Party’s claims. According to MU, Walker left school after the spring semester in 1990. That’s more than two years after the 1988 election, instead of the ""not long after"" the Dems claim. After we published our Dec. 18, 2013 story, Tate told us the Democratic Party was changing its website in light of the new information released by Marquette that contradicts the party’s claims. ""While we still stand behind our sources, only Scott Walker can clarify what happened in his time at Marquette University, and we'll afford the governor the respect of taking him at his word on this,"" Tate told the Journal Sentinel. ""Accordingly, we've updated our website."" The site now drops the ""forced out"" reference. But it still accuses Walker of ""masterminding"" the scheme to destroy newspapers. Walker, for his part, said this to PolitiFact Wisconsin about the accusation he was kicked out: ""I can say unequivocally that isn’t true."" Our rating The Democratic Party website said that ""Scott Walker was kicked out of student elections at Marquette University after masterminding a scheme that destroyed newspapers critical of him."" It added that ""Walker either dropped out or was forced out not long after."" The party offered nothing to backup up its claims, and our investigation found no backup either. And statements by Marquette go a long way to contradicting the party’s statements. We’ll revisit this item if new evidence emerges, but at this point, we rate the party’s claims False.",/factchecks/2013/dec/21/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democratic-party-says-scott-walker-was-k/

Scott Brown says his family roots go back nine generations in New Hampshire
","Since he lost his Senate seat in Massachusetts, Republican Scott Brown has been keeping his options open for a potential run for office in New Hampshire. While he hasn’t filed to run for any office, he’s viewed as a potentially strong challenger to U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. Speculation that he might run against Shaheen reached a fever pitch this week as news reports revealed he has a buyer for his home in Wrentham, Mass. and Brown confirmed he’s moving to New Hampshire. Brown has long owned a summer home in Rye, N.H. and he’s expected to renovate that house and make it his permanent residence. ""Once we get settled, we will do what many other people have done upon moving into New Hampshire,"" Brown said in a statement released Thursday Dec. 19, 2013. ""We will register to vote, get new licenses and enjoy the fact that there is no income or sales tax in New Hampshire."" In his statement and in a series of speeches this year, Brown has played up his ties to the state. ""I’m ninth-generation from New Hampshire,"" Brown told members of the Nashua Rotary Club in October. ""My grandparents are buried, and my great-grandparents, right in Portsmouth cemetery. My mom, my sister, my aunts and my uncles, my nieces -- they all live in New Hampshire. I have a house in New Hampshire. New Hampshire’s a great state."" Brown has repeated the claim about his ancestry several times, including in an interview with the New Hampshire Union Leader in October, and at a National Guard Association of New Hampshire state conference in Manchester in April. ""I think it’s important to note that I do have ties to New Hampshire,"" Brown said, according to published reports. ""Nine generations of ties to New Hampshire."" Others have also made the claim on his behalf. Karl Rove wrote in the Wall Street Journal in May that Brown is a ""ninth generation Granite Stater"" and could wage a competitive race against Jeanne Shaheen. Discussing his move to NH this week, Brown acknowledged he has lived in Massachusetts for most of his life, but also cited his family roots in the Granite State. ""For those who have read my book, you know that my first home was in New Hampshire,"" he said. ""My family and I have long and strong ties to the Granite State that go back many generations."" Not everyone is giving Brown a pass as a Granite Stater, however. At a GOP fundraiser in Nashua on Dec. 19, protesters from both the Republican and Democratic Party held signs labelling him a carpetbagger. ""Brownbagger go home to Mass,"" a bright yellow sign read. Here at PolitiFact New Hampshire, we wondered whether his claim of longstanding New Hampshire heritage was true. So we decided to look into the former U.S. senator’s family history. Who’s ""from"" New Hampshire? Taken literally, Brown is claiming that eight generations of his family before him came from New Hampshire. But what it means to be ""from"" New Hampshire is open to interpretation. It’s clear that Brown has spent considerable time in the Granite State over the years. People who aren’t born in a state, but grew up there, often claim to be from that place. But here in New England, where family trees can often be traced back to the early colonists, there tends to be a more exacting standard.   Put another way, the singer Ray Lamontagne was born in Nashua, N.H., but grew up in Utah and other parts of the country. He isn’t viewed as being ""from"" here. On the other hand, comedian Adam Sandler was born in New York and moved to Manchester, N.H. when he was five. He graduated from Central High School and his parents still live in the Queen City. Even though he now lives in Los Angeles, he is considered ""from New Hampshire."" We asked Brown to clarify his statement and discuss his family tree. In an email response, he thanked us for the inquiry, but refused to shed light on his familial claim. ""If and when I decide to run for political office again, then I will be happy to make that information available to everyone,"" Brown wrote. We decided to look for ancestors in Scott Brown’s family tree who were either born in New Hampshire or developed significant ties to the state early in life. This provides some wiggle room to count ancestors who weren’t born in New Hampshire, but could fairly say they’re ""from"" the state. Tracing Brown’s roots There have been a few attempts to trace Brown’s family history. One of the most notable was conducted by the New England Historic Genealogical Society, which documented that Brown shares a common ancestor with President Barack Obama. A genealogist named Robert Battle also provided a thorough sketch of Brown’s ancestry online. This served as a jumping-off point for our own research, pointing us to some useful birth, death and marriage records, town histories and genealogy publications. In his autobiography, published in 2011, Brown wrote that he knows little about his father’s side of the family. His parents both married and divorced four times, and Brown’s relationship with his father, Claude Bruce Brown, was strained. Brown writes that his father likely grew up in Pennsylvania, and says that he doesn’t know much about his grandfather. ""If you offered me a million dollars, I couldn't tell you anything about my father's father, not even his name,"" Brown wrote. For this reason, we didn’t consider him to be from New Hampshire and didn’t delve into Brown’s father’s side of the family. However, on his mother’s side of the family, Brown provides some useful details. His maternal grandfather, Philip Rugg, came from New Hampshire, growing up in Portsmouth. He moved to Cambridge, Mass. to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then became an electrical engineer working for Boston Edison. Brown’s grandmother, Bertha Louise (Coleman) Rugg hailed from Newington, and had ancestors who farmed in New Hampshire, according to Brown. Over the years, both grandparents were mentioned numerous times in The Portsmouth Herald, the daily newspaper covering the Seacoast area of New Hampshire and Maine. Their obituaries also provided the names of numerous relatives. Going back nine generations, we found that at least eight of Scott Brown’s ancestors resided in New Hampshire. One prominent branch of his family dates to 17th-century immigrant Francis Mathews, who sailed from Devonshire, England, to the area that became New Hampshire. Mathews bought land near the mouth of the Oyster River, which remained in the family’s possession for several generations. A burial ground known as Mathes Cemetery is located in the area, which is now called Durham Point. In their ""History of the Town of Durham, New Hampshire,"" authors Everett S. Stackpole and Winthrop S. Meserve wrote that it is ""doubtless"" Mathews traveled to New Hampshire in 1634 as part of the colony established by Captain John Mason. Mason secured a grant to settle the area that became New Hampshire as an English colony in 1623, according to Wesley Balla, director of collections and exhibitions at the New Hampshire Historical Society. Mason coined the name ""New Hampshire"" for the territory, which included an arc of land stretching 60 miles inland from the Maine border, between the Merrimack and Piscataqua rivers. A map created around 1670 of the ""Pascatway River"" -- as it was known then -- shows the area where the Mathews family land was located, which would have been inside the boundaries of Mason’s New Hampshire colony. Scott Brown is related to the great-great-grandson of Francis Mathews, Valentine Mathes (a spelling used by many of his descendants), who was born around 1720, in the area that is now Durham. He died there in 1814. Another one of Brown’s ancestors -- Joshua Crommett -- became established in Durham around the same time. Crommett’s family arrived in Durham and Lee in the 17th century, and he served as a Durham selectman from 1765-1772. Brown is also linked with a pair of families who lived in Dover, N.H.: Samuel and Mary Varney, who married in 1736; and William and Hannah Hussey. Their children, Timothy Varney and Abigail Hussey, both wed in New Hampshire, but later relocated to Berwick, Maine. Brown’s own biography If you tally it up, it’s clear that Brown has ancestors who go back nine generations in New Hampshire. This is true of the Mathes and Crommett families. Their descendants can be traced living in the area of Durham, Portsmouth and Newington. But how should we characterize Brown’s relationship with the state? After all, he implicitly includes himself in that unbroken link of nine generations. The reality is that it’s more ambiguous whether Brown or his mother can accurately claim to be ""from New Hampshire"" themselves, since they spent large parts of their lives living outside of the state. Brown’s grandparents, Philip and Bertha Rugg, left New Hampshire long before his mother was born. They were living in Wakefield, Mass. at the time, and remained there until they were in their 60s. When he was touring the Portsmouth Herald newsroom in 1972, Philip Rugg told a reporter that he lived most of his life in Massachusetts. That also appears to be true of Scott Brown’s mother. Born Judith A. Rugg, she was delivered May 9, 1938 at the hospital in Melrose, Mass., which is now known as Melrose-Wakefield Hospital. Although she lives in New Hampshire now, Brown’s mother confirmed during an interview that she was born and raised in Massachusetts. Brown also documented this in his book, writing that his mother grew up in a family home on Eastern Avenue in Wakefield, Mass. Judith Rugg graduated from Wakefield High School in 1956, then went to work at an Oldsmobile dealership in town for about one year, according to an article published in The Portsmouth Herald. She was working as a hostess and cashier in Hampton Beach, N.H., when she met Brown’s father during the summer of 1957, at age 19. In his book, Brown wrote that his mother was working ""in a restaurant along the thin slip of New Hampshire shoreline, with its clam chowder joints and seasonal souvenir stores."" His father was stationed at the nearby Pease Air Force Base. The couple wed on Nov. 23, 1957, and moved into one of the rental homes near downtown Portsmouth owned by Brown’s grandfather. Scott Brown was a New Hampshire resident at birth. He was born at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, just over the New Hampshire border, on Sept. 12, 1959. Brown spent the early months of his life in New Hampshire, but was younger than one year old when his parents split up. According to Brown’s book, his mother left Claude Bruce Brown and relocated to Wakefield, Mass. when she began to suspect he was breaking their marriage vows. Scott Brown and his mother lived in Massachusetts for the remainder of his childhood, moving around to 17 homes by the time he was 18. They lived for a time with his grandparents on Eastern Avenue, but left within a year or two and moved into the first of ""many anonymous places"" Brown and his mother would live, according to Brown’s book. They were living on Avon Street in Wakefield when Brown's mother met her second husband, Dan Sullivan. The family moved to Revere, Mass., but returned to Wakefield by the time Brown was entering junior high school. Brown devoted his time to athletics, playing basketball at Wakefield High School, from which he graduated in 1977. He went on to study Tufts University in Massachusetts, graduating in 1981, and earned a degree from Boston College Law School in 1985. Brown's grandparents eventually left Wakefield and returned to Portsmouth, and his visits with them became less frequent, according to his book. Meanwhile, Brown's biological father lived in Newburyport, Mass., where he remarried and would eventually become a town official. Judith Brown moved back to New Hampshire several years ago, although it’s not clear exactly when. A trust in her name has owned the home in Hampton where she resides since 2004. Our ruling Brown said he is ""ninth generation from New Hampshire."" For the most part, this is true: Brown’s New Hampshire lineage connects his grandmother to some of the region’s earliest European inhabitants. In fact, one of Brown’s ancestors, Francis Mathews, came to the New World in 1634 specifically to help settle the territory that became New Hampshire. But this isn’t the only relevant fact to consider. Brown’s statement can also be interpreted to mean that Brown counts himself as part of an unbroken line of ancestors who are ""from"" New Hampshire. It’s clear that Brown and his mother spent much of their lives in Massachusetts. The family connection to New Hampshire weakened after the birth of Brown’s grandmother, Bertha Rugg, who moved to Massachusetts and raised her daughter -- Brown’s mother -- in the Bay State. Brown himself stated in a press release sent this week that ""I have lived in Massachusetts for most of my life,"" and his trademark pickup truck parked outside a GOP fundraiser in Nashua on Dec. 19 still had Massachusetts license plates. Bottom line: It’s clear that New Hampshire is the ancestral home of many of Brown’s relatives, but it’s a stretch to say that Brown and his mother are ""from New Hampshire."" The statement is partially accurate, so we rate his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2013/dec/20/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-his-family-roots-go-back-nine-gen/

Obamacare law didn't mandate background checks of ""navigators,"" but states may require them and prime Texas grant recipient imposes them
","A Dallas congressman charged the Obamacare law with failing to bar convicts from helping Americans shop for health coverage. In an oped article written with Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., Republican Pete Sessions suggested the patient ""navigators"" authorized by the Affordable Care Act could include individuals experienced in stealing identities. The article was posted online Dec. 15, 2013, by the Dallas Morning News. Under the law, navigators are groups or individuals entrusted with helping individuals as they shop online for health coverage to comply with the Obamacare law’s mandate that most Americans obtain health insurance. The federal government says too that a navigator may help a consumer complete eligibility and enrollment forms. ""These individuals and organizations are required to be unbiased. Their services are free to consumers,"" the government says. However, Sessions wrote, the 2010 health-care law ""does not bar — or even require screening for — convicted felons, including individuals convicted of identity theft or fraud. This is particularly dangerous because navigators may have access to applicants’ personally identifiable information, including Social Security number date of birth, address, phone number and annual income. This poorly conceived program endangers families and individuals across the country by heightening the risk of identity theft or financial loss."" Is that so? Law doesn't mandate Our review of the law yielded no sign of a mandate that navigators be subject to criminal background checks, though the law says the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services ""shall establish standards for navigators… including provisions to ensure that any private or public entity that is selected as a navigator is qualified, and licensed if appropriate, to engage in the navigator activities described in this subsection and to avoid conflicts of interest."" The law continues: ""Under such standards, a navigator shall not... be a health insurance issuer; or...receive any consideration directly or indirectly from any health insurance issuer in connection with the enrollment of any qualified individuals or employees of a qualified employer in a qualified health plan."" The law further says the secretary shall, in collaboration with the states, develop standards to ensure information made available by navigators is fair, accurate and impartial. On April 5, 2013, Health and Human Services proposed rules for navigators; we did not spot a directive to conduct background checks there, nor was there one in the final rules, dated July 17, 2013. And by telephone, analyst Stacey Pogue of the liberal Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which has spoken up against proposed state rules imposing more training for navigators, pointed out that HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has spoken to Sessions’ claim. In a Nov. 6, 2013, hearing of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, the secretary was asked by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas: ""Isn't it true that there is no federal requirement for navigators to undergo a criminal background, even though they will receive personal -- sensitive personal information from the individuals they helped sign up for the Affordable Care Act?"" Sebelius: ""That is true. States could add an additional background checks and other features, but it is not part of the federal requirement."" Cornyn: ""So a convicted felon could be a navigator and could acquire sensitive personal information from an individual, unbeknownst to them."" Sebelius: ""That is possible. We have contracts with the organizations, and they have taken the responsibility to screen their individual navigators and make sure that they are sufficiently trained for the job."" Republican staff inquiry Sessions’ spokeswoman Torrie Miller, responding to our request for the basis of his claim, pointed by email to a Sept. 18, 2013, preliminary report by the Republican staff of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform quoting Vicki Gottlich, described as overseeing the navigator program for the federal government until June 2013, as confirming in an April 18, 2013, response to committee staff that ""convicted felons, including individuals convicted of identity theft"" could become navigators. According to the report, Gottlich also testified ""there’s nothing that prohibited HHS from (requiring individuals to have gone through a background check),"" but HHS ""determined that it would be up to the individual grantee to comply with state requirements for background checks and investigations of their employees."" According to Gottlich, the report said, ""in many states, there would be sufficient checks"" and ""the cost (of background checks) might be prohibitive for some entities,"" while entities in rural areas might have difficulty with background checks and fingerprinting. According to the report, Gottlich also testified that the agency never considered banning convicted felons or individuals convicted of identity theft from being navigators. The report quoted her as saying that all such hiring decisions were ""going to be up to each individual (navigator award) grantee,"" and, if a state’s laws allow, navigator organizations ""can hire convicted felons including those individuals convicted of identity theft."" Federal ""excluded parties"" list And what are the groups getting the navigator grants? Our search of the HHS website yielded a written statement prepared by a deputy administrator, Gary Cohen, for his May 21, 2013, appearance before a House subcommittee. Cohen said entities chosen to receive federal funds as navigators ""will be subjected to a robust screening process before grants are awarded."" A related footnote said: ""Entities and individuals are not eligible for a federal grant, including a navigator grant, if they are on the Excluded Parties List, which is a list of any entities or individuals who have been suspended or debarred by any federal agency. Entities or individuals may be suspended from receiving federal grant money for up to one year based on indictments, information or adequate evidence involving environmental crimes, contract fraud, embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, poor performance, non-performance or false statements."" The footnote continued: ""Entities or individuals may be debarred from receiving federal grant money for a longer period of time based on convictions, civil judgment or fact-based cases involving environmental crimes, contract fraud, embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, poor performance, non-performance or false statements as well as other causes. This careful screening will help to ensure that individuals or organizations that pose a risk to the federal government are not awarded federal navigator grants."" Texas grant recipient says it conducts checks In August 2013, according to a document posted online by the Texas State Library, the groups chosen to field navigator grants were: the United Way of Metropolitan Tarrant County; Migrant Health Promotion, Inc.; the National Hispanic Council on Aging; Change Happens, a Houston nonprofit; United Way of El Paso County; Southern United Neighborhoods, an anti-poverty group; the East Texas Behavioral Healthcare Network; and the National Urban League. Separately, the Texas Tribune said in an Aug. 15, 2013, news story that $10.8 million was awarded to the grant recipients with the biggest awardees being Tarrant County’s United Way ($5.8 million) and the East Texas network ($1.3 million). By email, an HHS spokesman in Washington, D.C., Fabien Levy, told us: ""Navigator grants are given to trusted community organizations that have a track record of working in their communities and all navigators must complete a minimum of 20 hours of training and comply with privacy and security standards. We take any alleged impropriety seriously and take immediate action in cases where navigators have failed to live up to their responsibilities."" It could be, too, that navigator grant recipients are conducting background checks already, though Miller of Sessions’ office told us by email that ""we have no way of knowing how many have actually done so."" A Dec. 3, 2013, news blog post by the Dallas Morning News said the Community Council of Greater Dallas and other partners in the navigator grant overseen by United Way of Tarrant County ""voluntarily subjected all navigators hired to criminal background checks and additional training on privacy."" By telephone, United Way spokeswoman Cassie McQuitty told us all of its 146 navigators underwent criminal background checks prior to being hired. By email, she said they also had been trained in consumer needs and privacy. Texas agency proposes mandatory background checks The News’ story noted, too, that the Texas Department of Insurance had proposed state-specific rules for navigators in the state. The agency’s Nov. 26, 2013, proposed rules state: ""HHS does not conduct or require a background check on navigators or individuals who represent navigator grant recipients."" The agency proposal says, too, that a measure passed into law by the 2013 Legislature authorized the state insurance commissioner to adopt rules providing that anyone who becomes a navigator not have a professional license suspended or revoked or have been the subject of any other disciplinary action by a financial or insurance regulator in the country--or been convicted of a felony. According to the agency’s proposal, TDI learned at a Sept. 30, 2013, Texas ""stakeholders"" meeting ""that one navigator entity in Texas had taken steps to provide protections beyond those set out in federal standards. These steps included background checks on employees and extra training focused on Texas Medicaid and privacy."" Sessions’ oped article said the ""lack of federal oversight of the navigator program has already led to reports of improper and illegal behavior, including two instances in North Texas. In Dallas, a navigator recommended that an applicant lie about his income in order to qualify for additional subsidies to lessen the costs of his health care plan. In Irving, a part-time receptionist who worked at a navigator center encouraged an individual to lie about his tobacco use to keep his premiums down."" A Nov. 12, 2013, Dallas Morning News’ blog post said that hidden-camera video taken by activist James O’Keefe evidently showed three Dallas navigators advising a consumer to lie about his income and whether he smokes as part of getting a better deal on subsidized health coverage in visits to offices in Irving and Oak Cliff in Dallas. The newspaper said the taped navigators advised a young man posing as a university student. ""He says he has a $15,000 a year job and unreported income from odd jobs. They tell him not to report the outside income on his health insurance application, if he has not disclosed it on his income taxes,"" the News said. ""They also urge him not to divulge that he occasionally smokes. ""‘You lie because your premiums will be higher,’ one says."" Later the same day, the newspaper reported, the Urban League of Greater Dallas and North Central Texas fired three navigator trainees and another employee in the wake of the incident. The proposed state rules would require navigators to: be 18 years of age; provide proof of U.S. citizenship or compliance with all federal laws pertaining to employment or to the transaction of business in the United States; provide proof of compliance with education requirements; and submit to fingerprinting and a background check. On its website, the department urges Texans to be careful while shopping for a policy. The agency further says: ""Currently, the federal government oversees navigators and counselors that help consumers shop for insurance in the federal marketplace. To verify a navigator or counselor is certified by the federal government, call the federal marketplace at 1-800-318-2596 or visit www.healthcare.gov. In addition, TDI is in the process of developing rules to further regulate navigators, ensuring that consumers’ personal information is protected and that navigators are well-trained and qualified."" A squib on another agency web page says: ""Navigators are funded through federal grants and should not request any money from you, nor will they receive a commission from an insurance company for helping you purchase coverage."" By telephone, agency spokesman John Greeley said the state rules are to be finalized after public hearings, the last one scheduled for Jan. 6, 2014. Other states Next, we wondered if other states were considering mandatory background checks of navigators. At Pogue’s suggestion, we reached Justin Giovannelli of the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute who said by email that at least a dozen other states have created or proposed some sort of required criminal background check of individuals seeking to be navigators: Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Tennessee, Utah and Wisconsin. Our ruling Sessions said federal law related to Obamacare navigators ""does not bar—or even require screening for—convicted felons, including individuals convicted of identity theft or fraud."" That’s correct, but this claim is missing important meaningful information. For instance, it fails to note that the federal government has an Excluded Parties list that prevents grants from going to agencies not in good standing. Also, the claim doesn’t acknowledge that states are permitted to impose background checks. A Texas agency was already weighing such a mandate when Sessions made this claim while nationally, other states have done so or are considering as much. Finally, this claim fails to note that the biggest Texas contractor for navigators has reported conducting a background check of each navigator it hired. We rate this statement, which lacks relevant details and context, as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Have far fewer ""living-wage jobs"" come back than were lost in the Great Recession?
","The United States has long been proud of its middle class and the ability of average citizens to afford a home or put their kids through college. But in the wake of the Great Recession and sluggish recovery, some wonder whether the economic landscape for middle-class Americans has changed forever. Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley added his voice to the discussion during a Dec. 4, 2013, talk to the Human Services Coalition of Oregon’s annual meeting. ""Sixty percent of the jobs we lost in the recession of 2008 were living-wage jobs,"" he said. ""Of the jobs we’ve gotten back, only 40 percent are living-wage jobs."" Those numbers suggest the middle class is headed for long-term trouble. PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We called Merkley’s Washington, D.C., office and asked where he got his numbers. Spokeswoman Martina McLennan sent us an eight-page study released in August 2012 by the New York-based National Employment Law Project. The non-partisan, non-profit organization’s report drew on statistics available through the second quarter of 2012. She also provided this statement: ""Senator Merkley defines a living-wage job as a job that can support a family’s necessities -- paying the bills and putting food on the table -- and leave a little left over to save for hard times and goals like college or retirement. Obviously, the exact number at which that becomes possible varies for each individual family. However, for a typical Oregon family of four, the minimum would likely fall in what the study calls the ‘mid-wage’ jobs range."" The study, titled ""The Low-Wage Recovery and Growing Inequality,"" echoed Merkley’s assertion. Mid-wage occupations, it said, constituted 60 percent of recession losses but only 22 percent of recovery growth. Higher-wage occupations were 19 percent of recession job losses and 20 percent of recovery growth. Lower-wage jobs represented 21 percent of recession losses but 58 percent of recovery growth. The 60 percent ""jobs lost"" figure Merkley used in his claim appears in the report. The 40 percent ""jobs gained"" figure he cited can be obtained by adding the number of mid-wage and higher-wage jobs listed in the report. Both, after all, constitute ""living-wage"" jobs. Next we called Anastasia Christman, the law project’s deputy director of access and opportunity. She walked us through the statistics, which she said came from her organization’s analysis of the Current Population Survey, a joint effort between the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau. Law project analysts, Christman said, defined mid-wage occupations as those capable of ""approaching income percentiles where you stop qualifying for assistance or safety-net programs."" ""No one is getting rich at that level,"" she said, ""but you’re not in poverty, either."" While Merkley’s claim pertained to the national economy, we wondered if Oregon has seen a similar situation. State economist Mark McMullen pointed us to an 18-page report written and released in October by Josh Lehner, a senior economist in the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis. ""The vast majority of the job loss during the recession occurred in both the upper middle- and lower middle-wage occupations,"" the report says. ""Out of the state’s total job losses of slightly more than 138,000, 88 percent were in either upper-middle or lower-middle occupational groups."" Similarly, job growth since 2012 has been dominated by both high- and low-wage occupations, Lehner wrote. The 7 percent gain in high-wage jobs compares to a less than 1 percent gain in upper-middle wage jobs. ""The findings in Josh’s report,"" McMullen wrote in an email, ""have a similar flavor to the Senator’s numbers."" And although the study Merkley relied on numbers available only through the second quarter of 2012, the same trends in job creation are still occurring, he said. We then called Gordon Lafer, an associate professor at the University of Oregon’s Labor Education and Research Center. He hadn’t heard Merkley’s claim before we contacted him but agreed with McMullen that it seemed on the mark. ""What he’s saying is true,"" Lafer said. ""The general point he’s making certainly fits with everything I’m seeing."" The economy, both nationally and in Oregon, has had a rocky ride since much of the bottom fell out in 2008. Unemployment statistics have improved, but thousands remain out of work. The number of mid-wage jobs added back during the recovery, according to statistics no one disputes, are far outstripped by the number of jobs added for lower-wage and higher-wage occupations. Merkley, in his talk to the Human Services Coalition of Oregon, said 60 percent of the jobs lost starting around 2008 were mid-wage positions, while only 40 percent of the jobs added during the recovery fit that description. His numbers line up with those found by the National Employment Law Project and with similar statistical analyses conducted by Oregon state economists. And though he based his assertion on the recovery using mid-2012 numbers, economists say the trend is holding. We rate his claim True. ",/factchecks/2013/dec/20/jeff-merkley/have-far-fewer-living-wage-jobs-come-back-were-los/

Ken Hagan says studies suggest a college football championship game could bring 1,800 jobs
","Hillsborough County boosters and politicians were ecstatic when organizers chose Tampa to host the 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship game. Even though the new college football playoff system doesn’t start until next year, each season-ending contest promises to be a big event, bringing big money with it. Hillsborough County Commissioner Ken Hagan, who helped develop the city’s bid to playoff executives, told a reporter he thought the game would bring an economic impact ""in the range"" of the Super Bowl, and had read studies that reflected the game could bring 1,700 to 1,800 full-time jobs to the area. Hagan wasn't quoted directly, but both Hagan and the reporter confirmed to us he had discussed that. ""I've attended four national championship games in three different cities, and the energy and excitement surrounding this game is not dissimilar to the Super Bowl,"" Hagan said. The job numbers kicked off the question here at PolitiFact Florida: How can a single game possibly create that many jobs? We decided to look into that statistic and figure out if that claim is through the uprights or a fumble. By the numbers The game, to be played at Raymond James Stadium on Jan. 9, 2017, is the finale of a playoff system designed to replace the current Bowl Coalition Series used to determine the best team in college football. The first game will be played in Arlington, Texas, in 2015, and in Arizona in 2016. Because the numbers in the story were paraphrased, the first thing we did was call Hagan’s office and confirm he actually said that. He said he had ""skimmed"" two reports the day before the announcement as the basis for those numbers. One was a South Florida Business Journal story about the economic impact of the 2012-13 Orange Bowl Festival, which included the Orange Bowl and the BCS National Championship game in Miami Gardens. The article reported on a study by Conventions Sports & Leisure International that said the games supported 2,400 new full- and part-time jobs, but no specifics beyond that. PolitiFact Florida attempted to contact Convention Sports & Leisure International, a Dallas event planning and economic development consulting firm, to discuss the findings, but our calls weren’t returned. The second report was by Arizona State University’s W.P. Carey School of Business examining the impact of three bowl games in 2010-2011. That study measured the statewide effects of the Insight Bowl in Tempe and the Fiesta Bowl and BCS National Championship game in Glendale, collectively referred to as the Festival of College Football. The Carey study measured jobs in terms of ""labor demand"" -- an equivalency for number of worker hours generated by the game. Broken down by event, the BCS National Championship game created the equivalent of 1,919 full-time jobs in Arizona; the Fiesta Bowl produced the equivalent of 469 full-time jobs; and the Insight Bowl added the equivalent of 855 jobs, the ASU study concluded. That doesn’t necessarily mean these are full-time new jobs, but we’ll get to more on that in a moment. Since both reports looked at combinations of games in a metropolitan area during bowl game season, we asked Hagan’s office if the commissioner was linking the championship game with the Jan. 1 Outback Bowl, also played in Raymond James Stadium. His office said he was referring only to the single playoff game. (There is no College Football Playoff National Championship game study yet, because studies are done after an event, and the first game isn't until 2015.) In an interview, Hagan said he had been asked the question about jobs and gave an answer he felt the studies reflected, specifically citing the Arizona State report that said the BCS Championship game created 1,919 jobs. ""I don’t know how they came up with it,"" Hagan said. ""It sounds kind of high to me."" The experts take the field Are those numbers too high? Yes, said Georgia State University economics professor Bruce Seaman, who wrote a study about the potential impact of a new stadium for the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons. ""This is grossly over-optimistic verging on the absurd, and yes, it is probably relating to full-time equivalent jobs, but still this is highly unlikely,"" he told PolitiFact Florida. So what is the measure of ""full-time equivalent"" employment? The measure is typically used in economic impact studies, defined as the annual average of monthly jobs in an industry. These can be broken down into fractions of an annual full-time job for the sake of measurement -- it can be recorded as one job for 12 months, or two jobs for six months each, or three jobs for four months and so on. A job can be either full-full time or part-time, and full-time can be defined to be as few as 30 hours a week, Seaman said. So when the reports talk about jobs, they’re not always talking about creating new jobs, even though the language they use sounds like it. The important thing to note is, these jobs aren’t limited to workers at the stadium, like ticket takers or security personnel. They can be direct jobs linked to an event itself, or indirect jobs created as the money from an event circulates through the local economy. Seaman said a more realistic, albeit rough estimate for potential jobs created for a metro area during an event like the championship game would probably be more in the range of 850 to 1,050, not 1,700 to 1,800. A comparable event would be the NFL’s annual Super Bowl, which also rotates host cities. A 2004 study co-authored by College of the Holy Cross economics professor Victor Matheson examined the effects of Super Bowls on their host communities from 1970 to 1997. It found the games brought an equivalent average of 537 jobs. ""Nineteen hundred jobs is a crazy number for a one-day event,"" Matheson said, pointing out an entire NFL team with eight home games a year only generates a few hundred full-time equivalent jobs. ""You make your room cleaners and your desk clerks work longer hours. I wouldn’t be surprised if 1,900 people worked some overtime."" University of South Florida economics professor Philip Porter said he believed economic impact reports tend to be flawed in any event, because statistical models are designed to measure permanent changes, not necessarily one-time events. Porter worked on a 1999 study tracking economic impact in Hillsborough County, Miami-Dade County and Maricopa County, Ariz., for several Super Bowls, but found no marked increase in taxable sales, during the event or afterward. Porter said he predicted activity in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties ""will be no different than usual."" Our ruling Hagan told a reporter he had read reports that suggested the game could result in 1,700 to 1,800 jobs for the region, based on findings after prior NCAA football title games. The reports were loaded with numbers, ranging from 2,400 full- and part-time jobs during the Miami area’s 2012-13 Orange Bowl week to 1,919 specified in a report breaking down Glendale’s 2011 title game. Economists said those kinds of numbers tend to be grossly inflated, and are difficult to parse, especially when the determining factors aren’t well-defined. Even with Hagan’s relatively conservative offhand guess, those experts said the numbers are wide of the goalposts. We rate this statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/dec/20/ken-hagan/ken-hagan-says-studies-suggest-college-football-ch/

Casting Scott Walker as a spender, Democratic Sen. Kathleen Vinehout says Walker bought cars that weren't necessary
","Criss-crossing Wisconsin to scope out a possible campaign for governor, state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout depicts Gov. Scott Walker as a spender and borrower, saying she would not have grown the state budget the way he has in his first term. In terms of spending, the Alma Democrat said at a suburban Milwaukee home on Dec. 5, 2013 she would ""get rid of some things that we probably don't really need,"" according to a video of part of the meeting. ""Like, I like to pick on the 80 new, brand-new vehicles that the governor bought,"" she told the group. ""We probably don't need 80 new, brand-new vehicles. So, get rid of that."" By emphasizing ""brand new,"" Vinehout suggests the vehicle purchases are unnecessary or excessive. So let’s peek into the garage. The backdrop Vinehout made her claim in tandem with two statements critical of Walker’s budgeting. In saying the governor’s 2013-’15 budget ""spends $4 billion more"" than his 2011-’13 budget, Vinehout made a claim similar to one made by Democrat Mary Burke, the only announced candidate for governor in 2014. We rated Burke’s statement, that the state budget had grown $4.6 billion under Walker, as Half True. The figure was accurate, but the increase is due almost completely to Medicaid costs, not budget decisions Walker made. Vinehout also said Walker’s two budgets led to a record percentage of state tax money being spent on debt payments. That also earned a Half True. The 5.26 percent of general fund revenue is the highest on record, but it reached that level because of the borrowing and debt restructuring done by previous governors, as well as by Walker. The vehicles Vinehout is recovering from surgery for a fractured arm she suffered in a car accident on Dec. 8, 2013 and was unavailable to comment. Her chief of staff, Linda Kleinschmidt, cited an appropriation in Walker's 2013-’15 budget, but said she did not know why Vinehout singled it out for criticism. The appropriation is for $1.14 million in 2013-’14, an increase of 15 percent over the previous year, and the same amount in 2014-’15, for a total of $2.28 million. The vehicles would be for Central Fleet, which is overseen by Walker's Department of Administration and manages about 1,500 of the state’s vehicles. The budget authorizes purchasing a total of 80 vehicles, but more specifically calls for adding 38 vehicles in 2013-’14 and 38 more the next year, for a total of 76. As of mid-December 2013 no vehicles had yet been purchased but planning is underway, according to Stephanie Marquis, spokeswoman for the Department of Administration. So, Walker’s budget authorizes the purchase of 80 vehicles, but to this point, he hasn’t bought any. The rationale Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said the purchases are aimed at saving money. He cited another budget document from the fiscal bureau. That memo says the Walker administration believes owning more vehicles will mean spending less on leasing vehicles and less on reimbursing state employees for work use of their personal cars. For example, the administration says the state-owned vehicles cost an average of 35 cents per mile to operate, while the per-mile state reimbursement rate to employees is 51 cents. All told, the Walker administration estimates the state will save $563,700 over the two-year budget if 76 vehicles are purchased. So, the purchases aren’t simply adding spending but rather are aimed at saving money in the long run. Our rating Vinehout said Walker bought ""80 new, brand-new vehicles"" for the state that ""we probably don’t need."" Walker did add money to the state budget to buy roughly 80 more vehicles. But he hasn’t bought any yet and, despite Vinehout’s characterization of the purchases being an unnecessary expense, they are aimed at saving money. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.
