Barack Obama gives Homeland Security millions for climate change, no 'line item' to fight extremism?
","A remark by U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy about President Barack Obama, climate change and violent extremism was so startling that an interviewer made a point to repeat it. And it made us wonder: Does the Department of Homeland Security really spend a bunch of money on climate change but doesn’t make it a priority to fight ""violent extremism?"" The Wisconsin Republican made his claim Dec. 9, 2015 after being asked about the terrorism in San Bernardino and how to fight such domestic threats. ""When the president sent over his budget to the House of Representatives, he had a homeland security budget,"" Duffy said on ""Varney & Co.,"" a talk show on Fox Business Network. ""He put $16 million to fight climate change in Homeland Security, and didn't have a line item to fight violent extremism. The president doesn’t take this seriously."" The claim surprised host Stuart Varney. ""That’s very important, Sean,"" Varney replied. Obama's budget for the Department of Homeland Security had $16 million for climate change ""but nothing extra, that we know about, to fight and find these guys who are already here? That's the situation?"" Varney asked. ""That is the situation,"" Duffy said. Well, not really. There is no line item in the Department of Homeland Security budget for fighting violent extremists -- defined by the department as ""individuals who support or commit ideologically-motivated violence to further political goals."" A line item can signify whether something is a priority, as Duffy argues. But his claim is misleading in that DHS, as well as other federal departments, spend money to fight violent extremism. Climate change To back the claim, Duffy’s office cited PolitiFact National’s May 2015 fact check of U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. McCaul had said more money is dedicated within the Department of Homeland Security to climate change than what's spent combating ""Islamist terrorists radicalizing over the Internet in the United States of America."" Our colleagues rated the statement Mostly True. But Duffy’s claim is much broader -- about fighting violent extremism generally, rather than spending specifically to fight Islamist terrorists over the Internet. Our colleagues found that the Department of Homeland Security’s budget for fiscal 2016 arguably included $16 million for climate change. That figure was part of Duffy’s claim. There is $10 million ""for analyses of climate change impacts on infrastructure critical to national and economic security, and national public health and safety."" And $6 million for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is part of homeland security, for ""climate workshops and regional resilience coordination"" done by FEMA. And while the Department of Homeland Security has a senior-level official who serves as the coordinator of Countering Violent Extremism, that office has no separate line item in the budget. But just because there isn’t a line in a budget doesn’t mean the department is ignoring violent extremism. A few examples from the Department of Homeland Security’s budget: Four to eight full-time staff assigned to countering violent extremism. $1 million for a database to analyze past violent extremist incidents and see what sort of programs work best to head off attacks. Part of the department’s $1 billion National Preparedness Grant Program to state and local governments can be spent on projects to spot early signs of terrorist planning. Said Duffy spokeswoman Cassie Smedile: Four to eight staffers isn’t a sign of a high priority to ""when you consider that DHS employs more than 240,000 people."" Fair point. But does the average citizen necessarily care which department’s federal employees are involved in fighting violent extremism? The Department of Homeland Security works with federal and local agencies on countering violent extremism. And the Justice Department has a $15 million line item for countering violent extremism, including $4 million for ""domestic radicalization research."" Our rating Duffy said Obama’s homeland security budget had ""$16 million to fight climate change"" but ""didn't have a line item to fight violent extremism."" There is no line item in the Department of Homeland Security budget for fighting violent extremism. But that ignores the fact that millions of dollars are allocated, inside and outside the Department of Homeland Security, to counter violent extremists. Duffy’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974A0DC0>],/factchecks/2015/dec/18/sean-duffy/barack-obama-gives-homeland-security-millions-clim/

Trump repeats tale of flights home of 9/11 hijackers' wives, girlfriends, families
","In the confrontation with ISIS, Donald Trump has staked out perhaps the hardest of the hard lines among the Republican presidential field. He has called for blocking virtually all non-American Muslims from entering the country. He said America should ""take out"" the families of terrorists. During the Republican debate in Las Vegas on CNN, the moderator used a question from the public to press Trump on this policy. ""How would intentionally killing innocent civilians set us apart from ISIS?"" asked Josh Jacob from Georgia Tech. Trump did not repeat his call to ""take out"" family members but insisted the country has to be much tougher on family members because of what they know. ""When you had the World Trade Center go, people were put into planes that were friends, family, girlfriends, and they were put into planes and they were sent back, for the most part, to Saudi Arabia,"" Trump said. ""They knew what was going on. They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television."" We reached out to the Trump campaign about the 9/11 terrorists’ close friends and family members leaving before the attacks and did not hear back. Trump has said this before, sometimes saying specifically that they were sent home a few days before the attack. He told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly ""They take the wives, they put ‘em on planes, they send ‘em home. ‘Let’s go home and let’s watch Daddy tonight on television knock down the World Trade Center.' "" In North Carolina, Trump told his supporters ""the people, the animals that did that, they sent their wives and their families back to Saudi Arabia. Most of them went back to Saudi Arabia. Those wives knew what their husbands were going to do."" The statement lacks any support. The 9/11 hijackers Trump needs two pieces to back up his statement. First, at least some of the hijackers needed to be married or have a girlfriend, and second, those people, or some family member, needed to be in the United States. According to the 9/11 Commission report, not a single hijacker had a wife, girlfriend or family member in the country in the days and months before the terrorists executed their plan. Only two of the 19 hijackers were married and only one had a girlfriend. Ziad Jarrah had a girlfriend in Germany, and hijackers Marwan al-Shehhi and Abdul Aziz al-Omari were married. Philip D. Zelikow, executive director of the 9/11 Commission, told us that while the commision didn't learn the exact whereabouts of the wives, whether in Saudi Arabia, Yemen or elsewhere in the Middle East, one thing is certain. ""They sure weren’t living in the United States,"" Zelikow said. If no one was in America, there could be no flying home to ""watch their boyfriends on television."" The commission found no evidence that any of these women knew about the plot in advance. The commission reported that most of the terrorists had ""broken off regular contact with their families."" The one clear exception was Jarrah, who traveled to Lebanon to see his father and vacationed with his girlfriend in Florida about eight months before the attack. Jarrah called her in Germany shortly before he boarded United Airlines flight 93, the plane that crashed in rural Pennsylvania. Jarrah’s girlfriend was extensively interviewed by investigators who concluded she knew nothing. To be complete, we turn to one episode that could be linked to Trump’s statement. Bin Laden family members Trump’s words might reflect some confusion with the hastily organized departures of members of Osama bin Laden’s extended family -- not any wives or girlfriends of bin Laden himself -- a few days after the attack.  Most of the bin Laden relatives were in high school or college in the United States. In an interview with the New York Times, Saudi Ambassador Bandar bin Sultan said that with the help of the FBI, his government arranged for these people to assemble in Washington where a chartered plane would take them back to Saudi Arabia. Bin Laden is one of 52 children of a man who built enormous wealth building roads and palaces. That gave him a large extended and affluent family. The 9/11 Commission report said that the FBI dug into the backgrounds of every Saudi national who flew home soon after the attacks. ""They concluded that none of the passengers was connected to the 9/11 attacks and have since found no evidence to change that conclusion,"" the report said. ""Our own independent review of the Saudi national involved confirms that no one with known links to terrorism departed on these flights."" Our ruling Trump said that people close to the 9/11 hijackers -- friends, wives and girlfriends -- had knowledge of the pending attacks and were flown back to the Middle East so that they could ""watch their boyfriends on television."" Trump provided no evidence. The 9/11 Commission investigation found that 13 of the 19 attackers were unmarried. Only two had wives, a third had a girlfriend, and none of those women were in the United States immediately before the attack. The commission further found evidence that the hijackers had cut ties with their families. There is no substance behind the statement. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B194C0>],/factchecks/2015/dec/17/donald-trump/trump-repeats-flights-home-911-hijackers-wives-gir/

Lamar Smith says Clean Power Plan will raise Texas energy costs by 16 percent a year: False
","U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, the Environmental Protection Agency and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been frequent sparring partners. In a Dec. 6, 2015 oped column, Smith, R-San Antonio, took to  the San Antonio Express-News to warn readers against  the EPA’s Clean Power Plan. The EPA has described the Clean Power Plan as a necessary, though not sufficient, step in addressing climate change -- and as part of a larger strategy to spur other nations to reduce emissions. It was the subject of a previous fact check. The plan is aimed at states with fossil-fuel fired electrical plants. Smith wrote: ""Texans will be hit even harder than those in other states. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has estimated that the Obama administration’s Power Plan will cause energy costs in Texas to rise as much as 16 percent per year."" According to the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission, ERCOT manages 90% of the electrical load of Texas; it is a nonprofit corporation. The way the statement is phrased, it sounds as though every year energy costs in Texas will rise  16 percent. But the ERCOT report on the effects of the EPA Clean Power Plan says the increase will be over a longer period of time.   Smith’s statement was based on incorrect information provided by an ERCOT official to his House Science, Space and Technology Committee. The ERCOT Oct. 16, 2015 report and an accompanying news release says that ""energy costs for customers may increase by up to 16% by 2030 due to the CPP alone, without accounting for the associated costs of transmission upgrades, higher natural gas prices caused by increased gas demand, procurement of additional ancillary services, and other costs associated with the retirement or decreased operation of coal-fired capacity in the ERCOT Region"" (ERCOT does not estimate how much these other factors might raise energy costs in their analysis). In other words, by 2030, energy costs will have risen 16 percent since the CPP took effect. So, how big is the disparity between a 16 percent increase by 2030 and a 16 percent increase each year until 2030? It helps to know when the Clean Power Plan is scheduled to come into effect. According to the EPA’s Clean Power Plan Final Rule, states with fossil fuel-fired electric generating units need to create plans that set emissions standards for those units. Vermont and the District of Columbia are exempt because they have none of the relevant units, and Alaska and Hawaii are exempt because the EPA says it lacks enough information to determine the best system of emission reduction for non-contiguous states. Plans are due in 2016 (with a possible extension to 2018), and the reduction in emissions needs to start by 2022, with extra rewards for states that also cut emissions in 2020 and 2021. If energy costs rise 16 percent each year from 2022 until 2030, that is roughly a 327 percent increase in the cost of energy. To help put this in real terms, we crunched some numbers on energy costs in Texas. The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Residential Energy Consumption Survey reported the average annual electricity cost per Texas household at $2,160 in 2009, the last year for which data are available, and just under 4.5 percent of the median household income in Texas that year. Adjusted for inflation, that’s about $2,394 in 2015. If the Clean Power Plan caused energy costs to increase 16 percent by 2030, that bill would rise to about $2,777 in today’s dollars. If energy costs increased 16 percent per year, though, that bill would be $7,828. The median household income in Texas was $53,035 by the last Census. The first price would mean Texans would spend around 5 percent of their yearly household income on energy, while the higher number implies energy costs would eat up closer to 15 percent of income. Smith, whose 21st Congressional District includes portions of San Antonio, Austin and the Texas Hill Country, is chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, with jurisdiction over the EPA, NOAA and NASA. A spokeswoman for his committee, Laura Crist, said in an email statement that the congressman’s claim of a 16-percent increase per year was based on communications with ERCOT staff. She noted that the ERCOT estimate is conservative and does not include costs for upgrades. ERCOT, meanwhile, stood by the estimate in the report. ""It’s the 16 percent by 2030 that’s correct,"" said Robbie Searcy, ERCOT communications manager. Searcy said in a telephone interview that information provided to the House committee ""created a misunderstanding in the congressman’s office and that’s why there was an error."" Our ruling One of PolitiFact’s Truth-O-Meter principles is that words matter, and at the very least, Smith's claim is worded ambiguously. The ERCOT analysis and a news release point to an increase in energy costs of 16 percent by 2030. Smith claims that increase per year. We rate this claim as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. EDITOR’S NOTE 3:30 p.m., 12/18/15: After publication, Trip Doggett, ERCOT president and chief executive officer, emailed a statement saying Smith’s statement of 16 percent per year was based an erroneous information provided by ERCOT. ""Because ERCOT inadvertently provided incorrect information to the Chairman’s staff, I would like to take this opportunity to state the correct information and offer an apology.""

Geneva Conventions bar Donald Trump's idea of killing terrorists' families, as Rand Paul says
","Donald Trump says the United States should kill the family members of terrorists, and not to do so is just being ""politically correct."" ""The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families,"" Trump said on Fox and Friends on Dec. 2, 2015. ""They care about their lives, don't kid yourself. When they say they don't care about their lives, you have to take out their families."" Trump got a challenge on this at the CNN presidential debate in Las Vegas. CNN aired a pre-recorded question from Josh Jacob, a student at Georgia Tech: ""Recently Donald Trump mentioned we must kill the families of ISIS members. However, this violates the principle of distinction between civilians and combatants in international law."" Trump doubled down on his position: ""I would be very, very firm with families"" and repeating his sentiment that even though people think ""they may not care much about their lives … they do care, believe it or not, about their families' lives."" Later in the debate, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul took Trump to task for that approach. ""If you are going to kill the families of terrorists,"" Paul said, ""Realize that there's something called the Geneva Convention we're going to have to pull out of. It would defy every norm that is America."" We wondered whether Paul was right about the Geneva Convention, so we asked a range of experts in international law. They said Paul was correct and pointed to two key pieces of international agreements. What the Geneva Convention says about fighting terrorist groups The Geneva Conventions were designed after World War II to establish agreed-upon rules of war. The United States, like most countries, is a party to them and ""is hugely committed in principle and in the training of soldiers,"" said Steven R. Ratner, a University of Michigan law professor. All four Geneva Conventions from 1949 contain ""Common Article 3,"" which applies to ""armed conflict not of an international character."" What does that mean? The U.S. Supreme Court, in the 2006 case Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld, ruled that ""armed conflict not of an international character"" means a war that is not fought against a sovereign state. (A sovereign state simply means a country with a recognized government.) Since groups like ISIS are not considered sovereign states, that means that Common Article 3 applies to the current war on terrorism. According to Common Article 3, people who are taking no active part in the hostilities ""shall in all circumstances be treated humanely… To this end, the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever … violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture."" Experts said this language would make Trump’s approach a violation of the Geneva Conventions, assuming that the family members were not taking part in terrorist activities. Common Article 3 ""would seem to prohibit any targeting of families or others who were ‘taking no active part in hostilities,’ "" said Anthony Clark Arend, Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service. ""The principle of noncombatant immunity is a fundamental principle of international law."" What the Geneva Conventions say about targeting civilians This extension of the original Geneva Conventions was finalized in 1977. The most relevant portion for judging the Trump scenario appears to be Article 51.2, which states, ""The civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack. Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited."" This root principle here is to ensure that civilians are not the object of an attack, said Richard D. Rosen, director of the Center for Military Law and Policy at the Texas Tech University School of Law. ""I believe that a policy of intentionally and directly targeting the families of terrorists, assuming the family members are not combatants themselves, is a gross violation of the law of war and a war crime,"" Rosen said. Rosen and others acknowledged that there are some gray areas when putting this provision into practice. For instance, the Geneva Conventions don’t outlaw all civilian casualties when armed forces are undertaking a military objective. It effectively permits them if precautions are taken and the ""expected loss of life or injury to civilians, and damage to civilian objects incidental to the attack, is not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained,"" Rosen said. This balance can be difficult to strike, Ratner said, but at least it means that ""you can't kill a huge number of people just to knock out a small target."" There’s another wrinkle: Officially, the United States is not a party to the Additional Protocols of 1977. However, the United States has blessed them in practice, experts said. The United States ""has recognized much of (the Additional Protocols) as binding customary law,"" said Mary Ellen O'Connell, a Notre Dame law professor. The Supreme Court ""said as much in Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld in 2006. As customary international law, the U.S. cannot ‘pull out’ of the rule. It binds us until a new treaty rule or customary rule supersedes it."" In addition, Rosen said, the Defense Department Law of War Manual published in June 2015 says that civilians may not be made the object of an attack. The provisions in the Additional Protocols ""prohibit acts of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror in a civilian population,"" said David P. Fidler, a law professor at Indiana University. ""Trump's proposal to have U.S. military forces deliberately kill families, including women and children, in order to deter ISIS fighters is a proposal to use acts of violence to spread terror among civilians. Or Trump wants to fight terror with terror, something abhorrent to America's warriors and unconscionable as a suggestion from someone who wants to be commander in chief."" Our ruling Paul said, ""If you are going to kill the families of terrorists, realize that there's something called the Geneva Convention we're going to have to pull out of."" A range of experts in international law agreed that at least two elements of the Geneva Convention would contravene a policy of killing family members of terrorists, and that the United States has demonstrated a commitment to adhering to both provisions. We rate Paul’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809695FF00>],/factchecks/2015/dec/17/rand-paul/rand-pauls-right-geneva-conventions-bar-donald-tru/

State Sen. Chris Larson off the mark on claim about Milwaukee County bus fares
","  State Sen. Chris Larson supported Chris Abele’s bid for the Milwaukee County executive post in 2011. Now, Larson is challenging the incumbent and trying to convince voters Abele’s time in office hasn’t been successful. Larson, a Milwaukee Democrat and former member of the County Board, appeared Nov. 22, 2015 on WISN-TV’s UpFront with Mike Gousha program and said he’s disappointed in Abele’s leadership. ""He’s out of touch,"" Larson said.   Gousha listed some of Abele’s successes and asked, ""Does he get any credit for (the successes)?"" Larson countered by attacking one of Abele’s main talking points -- transit. Larson said the Milwaukee County bus system has ""among the highest fares in the nation."" We recently checked Abele’s claim that since he took office ""we have never raised"" bus fares and ""this year there’ll be a million more route-miles than there were five years ago."" We rated the claim Mostly True. Budget documents show fares have been $2.25 since Abele took office in 2011 and route-miles are up by about 1 million. But Abele credited himself for the increased route miles, when many of them were the result of a settlement related to a lawsuit. So, fares have stayed at $2.25. But is Larson right that they are ""among the highest fares in the nation""? National comparison The Milwaukee County Transit System charges a flat fare of $2.25 in cash for a one-way adult bus ticket. Patrons who get a Smart Card pay $1.75 per ride. Transfers are free. When asked for backup, Larson’s team sent a list with the one-way adult bus fare for 11 cities. In that comparison, only Pittsburgh was higher than Milwaukee County, charging $2.50 for a base fare that increases to $3.75 for longer trips. Two other cities -- Denver and Cleveland -- charge $2.25 per ride, the same as Milwaukee County. In 2016, fares in Denver will increase to $2.60. But is Larson cherry picking the data? When we reached out to the Milwaukee County Transit System for its take, officials compiled a list of 20 systems comparable in size to MCTS. That list showed seven transit systems with higher base fares than Milwaukee County. At the top was Pittsburgh, with fares in Seattle and the Twin Cities rounding out the top three, at fares of up to $3.25 and $3, respectively. Another four systems had rates above $2.25 for longer routes (matching Milwaukee County) or charged $1 for a transfer (something that is free in Milwaukee County). There is no great single resource for information of bus fares across the country and the fares are often change. One survey conducted by the American Public Transit Association in 2014 compares about 250 transit systems across the country, though some of its data is already outdated. At the time, nine cities on that list charged more than Milwaukee’s $2.25 cash fare. The highest fare -- in Nashville -- was $4 per ride. Our rating Larson said the Milwaukee County bus system has ""among the highest fares in the nation."" But the system’s’ $2.25 cash fare wasn’t at the top of a national comparison, with fares reaching as high as $4 per trip. And regular patrons who use a Smart Card are charged just $1.75 a ride, making the Milwaukee County bus system about on par with average costs.

Did 2,000 suspected terrorists legally buy guns in the U.S.?
"," Every year, millions of average Americans legally buy guns in this country. But have thousands of people on the FBI’s Terrorist Watch List also legally purchased guns, and other weapons, on U.S. soil? That’s the claim Rep. Mike Thompson, D-St. Helena, made following the terrorist attack in San Bernardino. Thompson and others in Congress called for a ban on weapons purchases by anyone on the watch list. The U.S. Senate struck down a bill that sought to accomplish that earlier this month. ""Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the United States,"" Thompson said on floor of the House of Representatives on Dec. 7, urging passage of the bill.  Was this true? We decided to fact-check the eye-opening statement. But first, we wanted to learn more about the list itself. The list, which includes the smaller No Fly List, is a database comprising information about ""those known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity,"" according to the FBI. National security officials consider it a key tool in preventing future attacks. Civil liberty groups and some elected leaders have called it unconstitutional, citing a lack of due process and vague standards for inclusion on the list. It’s caused headaches at airport security checkpoints for people with similar names to those on the list, including the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Elk Grove. The database is believed to include hundreds of thousands of individuals, including roughly 10,000 Americans. But being on the list as a ""suspected terrorist"" does not mean the person has a criminal record, or has ever been charged with a crime. It just means they’re ""reasonably suspected"" by a federal official of being involved in terrorist activity. Our Research We know it’s legal for suspected terrorists to buy weapons — specifically, guns — because that’s the right Thompson and even President Obama have said they want to take away. But how are purchases by suspected terrorists tracked? And how can anyone know for certain that ""more than 2,000"" have legally bought weapons over the past decade in the U.S.? Enter the FBI. The federal agency conducts instant criminal background checks on people seeking to buy firearms at licensed gun stores. In 2004, these checks began examining whether an applicant was on the terrorist watch list.  Photo by Andrew Nixon/Capital Public Radio In March, the U.S. Government Accountability Office published an analysis of FBI data showing that from February 2004 through December 2014, 2,043 out of 2,233 weapons applications by people on the terrorist watch list were allowed to proceed. Nearly all applications were for firearms. Three were for explosives, all of which were approved. When we contacted Thompson’s office, a staffer pointed us to the GAO analysis to back up the congressman’s claim. The GAO found an average of about 200 successful weapons purchases by the group of people on the list, each year, during the timeframe. Experts we spoke with told us there’s no way of independently verifying information on the list, as it’s not public. They referred to the GAO analysis as the best estimate available. ""I have no means of independently confirming who is a reasonable suspect even if I knew the names. I imagine this is true of most average persons. We have to go on trust,"" Martha Crenshaw, Stanford University political science professor and expert on terrorism, said in an email. The FBI has declined to comment on the watch list’s current size, but we found an estimate on a 2011 FBI fact-sheet that put it at 420,000 individuals. Of those, only about 8,400 were American citizens or legal residents. Current estimates of the number of people on the list -- foreign and American combined -- now hover around 700,000. A 'plausible number' Two experts who helped oversee the watch list told us the congressman’s claim of ""more than 2,000"" suspected terrorists legally buying weapons over 10 years is realistic. ""That’s certainly a plausible number,"" said Martin Reardon, former chief of the FBI Terrorist Screening Center’s operations branch. The screening center maintains the watch list. Reardon, who now works for an intelligence consulting firm, estimated the number of Americans on it is currently no more than 10,000. Another expert knowledgeable about the list agreed. ""Two thousand, over such a long period of time -- 10 years -- does not actually strike me as being overly large because there are a lot of people in this country that are purchasing firearms,"" said Timothy Edgar, who oversaw civil liberties and national intelligence issues, including the terrorist watch list, under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. ""So it’s not surprising that there’s been a fairly substantial number of encounters with people who are on that terrorist watch list for one reason or another, over the past decade."" The data show weapons applications, not the number of individuals making those requests. So presumably, the same person could have made multiple applications. Even so, the experts said, the number cited by Thompson could be much higher. Suspected terrorists could have legally bought weapons at gun shows, where transactions are not subject to federal background checks. Faulty list? While there’s data to back up Thompson’s claim, it’s also important to consider the accuracy of the names on the terror watch list. How do we know, for example, that the people on the list really are ""suspected terrorists?"" In 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General released an audit  that found that 35 percent of the identities on the watch list at the time were ""associated with FBI cases that did not contain current international terrorism or domestic terrorism designations."" Many of the records were for people who had originally ""been appropriately watchlisted but should have been removed from the watchlist after the case had been closed,"" the audit said. The American Civil Liberties Union has repeatedly criticized what it calls the ""unconstitutionally vague"" standards for inclusion on the terror watch list. It repeated a call earlier this month for major reforms of the database. Edgar and Reardon both acknowledged the list is ""not perfect."" Edgar added, however, that many of the early problems with the list, which caused some people with the same name as a suspected terrorist to be stopped at airports, have been resolved. Even if a large chunk of the names on the list are outdated, we presume a majority truly are ""suspected terrorists,"" based on our research and that of the experts we spoke with. Our Ruling Rep. Mike Thompson said recently on the House floor that: ""Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the U.S."" He backed up his claim with FBI data that show 2,043 people on the agency’s terror watch list successfully applied for weapons at licensed gun shops over the past decade. There’s no way to track how many people on the list legally bought weapons at gun shows, as those transactions aren’t subject to federal background checks. But it makes sense to assume some did. The congressman left out the fact that a federal audit in 2009 found 35 percent of the identities on the list had no ties to current terrorism cases. The audit said many of the names remained on the list when they should have been removed. But given the large size of the terror watch list — with perhaps 10,000 Americans and hundreds of thousands of foreigners — it’s reasonable to assume that 200 or more on the list made legal weapons purchases each year over the past decade.

","Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz went head to head over the government’s bulk phone data collection program at the Dec. 15 Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas. The domestic surveillance program allowed the National Security Agency to secretly access the metadata of millions of phone calls; it was made public by government contractor Edward Snowden. Congress curtailed the program and it officially shut down just days before the San Bernardino terrorist attack. Ruibo says it has limited the government’s ability to fight terrorism. On the debate stage, Cruz defended his position. He said the replacement law, the USA Freedom Act, not only respects civil liberties by stopping the government from automatically collecting bulk data, but it also expands the government’s ability to gather terrorists’ phone records. ""The old program covered 20 to 30 percent of phone numbers to search for terrorists,"" Cruz said. ""The new program covers nearly 100 percent. That gives us greater ability to stop acts of terrorism, and he knows that’s the case."" Rubio responded, ""Let me be very careful when answering this, because I don’t think national television in front of 15 million people is the place to discuss classified information, so let me just be very clear: There is nothing we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before."" That’s a pretty stark difference --- Cruz says we’ll have access to many more phone numbers, and Rubio says this bill doesn’t do anything new. We decided to focus on Rubio’s statement. Bigger pool, fewer fish Prior to the USA Freedom Act, major phone companies like Verizon and AT&T would steadily hand over all of their phone records to the NSA, which maintained a massive database. The records include information like the location of a call, phone numbers involved and the length of the call, but not the content or audio. Intelligence workers could then run a phone number with terrorist ties through the database to find out who they called and when. The USA Freedom Act changes things by keeping these records in the hands of the phone companies. If the government wants to look at a suspected terrorist’s call data, they must first get a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which operates in secret. Interestingly, the old program wasn’t as sweeping as you might have thought. It turns out the NSA only collected about 20 percent of all call data, missing the vast majority of cell phone records, according to intelligence officials and first reported by the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post. The NSA faced technical challenges in collecting cell phone and Internet phone data, in part due to the major shift away from landlines. To remedy this, the new law is ""technology neutral,"" said Jeffrey Vagle, executive director of the Center for Technology, Innovation and Competition at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Under the law, the NSA can compel any phone company to provide records in whatever format the government desires, per the warrant. Before, there were some limits on how responsive phone companies had to be. The law also allows for a much wider breadth of information that the NSA can request; it just can’t collect this data in bulk. To steal an analogy from policy managers at Access Now, a technology advocacy group, ""Basically, there is a bigger ocean they can fish in, but they collect far fewer fish."" So if we are directly comparing the old bulk data collection program to the new program established by the Freedom Act, the government has more tools to access a larger array of records -- cutting against Rubio’s point that ""there is nothing we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before."" However, there is a grain of truth to what Rubio is saying: The government always had some ability to obtain cell phone records to a certain extent, just not through the old bulk data collection program, said Julian Sanchez, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. The main difference now is that the government is working with the carriers to obtain those records more efficiently. ""If you're just narrowly comparing the bulk program with its direct replacement, it’s true it will cover more types of records,"" Sanchez said. ""But it's also true that there's no new legal authority to get records that were previously unavailable to the government."" Vagle said it’s possible that the government could have collected cell phone records through existing avenues, such as emergency request approval by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and the 1981 Executive Order 12333, which expanded intelligence-gathering abilities. He added that many tech and security experts think the idea that the government only collected 20 percent of phone records is likely an underestimate. ""Cruz was correct in comparing the USA Freedom Act to the unmodified Patriot Act (the old bulk collection program),"" Vagle said. ""But if you look at the entire set of tools available to the intelligence community, Rubio was probably correct."" Speaking of Cruz and Rubio together, Sanchez said, ""they’re both sort of right and both sort of wrong."" Our ruling Rubio said, regarding the USA Freedom Act, ""There is nothing we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before."" Rubio was responding to a point by Cruz that the Freedom Act makes it possible for the government to access a much bigger pool of phone records. Whereas the old bulk phone data collection program wasn’t very good at collecting cell phone and Internet phone records, the Freedom Act establishes parameters that make this more feasible. However, it’s not like the government couldn’t access these records at all before, they just couldn’t do it through the bulk collection program. The law did not give the government a brand-new legal authority, it just helps to streamline the record collection process. We rate Rubio’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096947EC0>],/factchecks/2015/dec/16/marco-rubio/rubio-and-cruz-spar-over-domestic-surveillance-pro/

Uber says drunk-driving crashes down in Austin since advent of ride-sharing services
","UPDATE, 12:50 p.m., May 6, 2016: Months after this fact check posted, the Austin American-Statesman obtained Austin Police Department statistics that conflict with the numbers the agency provided us when we conducted the check. The updated figures, which suggest more than 80 previously untallied DWI collisions in 2014 and 2015, would change our calculations in the fact check below, resulting, for instance, in 12 percent fewer DWI collisions in 2014 compared with 2013, not 24 percent fewer. That said, we’re not changing our story or adjusting the original Truth-O-Meter rating. The new data were not available to Uber at the time the company aired its claim, which was based on a news report that also used data the police department provided.Uber, a prominent ride-sharing service, has urged Austin-area supporters to tell Austin City Council members not to limit how it does business in part, it says, because drunken-driving accidents declined after such services started locally. ""Ridesharing is moving Austin forward,"" Uber says in a web post including a petition for council members that we spotted in November 2015. ""Recent news reports indicate DWI crashes in Austin dropped 23 percent since ridesharing entered the market."" We wondered about the declared link. It seems plausible that if residents who consume alcohol avoid driving by enlisting a ride-sharing service, there could be fewer drinking-related accidents. In January 2015, indeed, Temple University researchers concluded from reviewing California data that the availability of ride-sharing at a lower cost than traditional taxi service in certain cities reduced drunk-driving deaths by up to about 6 percent. On the other hand, social scientists and statisticians are often quick to point out correlations don’t prove causation. Even if DWI-connected accidents are down since Uber arrived in Austin, it's not a certainty that's because of Uber's presence. Uber's backup To our emailed inquiry about ride-sharing and Austin accidents, Uber spokeswoman Brooke Anderson pointed out a March 2, 2015, KVUE-TV news story stating that according to the Austin Police Department, DWI arrests and crashes were down citywide, ""and there could be a few reasons why,"" the station said. The story said the number of DWI arrests had dropped 16 percent in 2014, according to APD statistics. ""DWI-related crashes fell even more citywide, decreasing by 23 percent last year,"" as in 2014, the story said, which also is ""the year ride-sharing started in Austin, with services like Uber and Lyft entering the market."" Asked when Austin residents became able to use a cell-phone app to call a ride-sharing service, Anderson told us Uber launched in Austin in June 2014.  But it wasn't until October 2014 that the council gave permission to the Uber and Lyft ride-sharing companies to operate, effective a month later, and the city indicated plans to develop permanent rules later. KVUE’s news story quoted APD DWI Enforcement Lt. Keith Walker saying he didn’t  know how much of an impact its arrival had on drunk driving in Austin, but he said the more travel options people have, the better. Police department figures Next, we asked the police department for a month-by-month breakdown of DWI collisions. To our inquiry about Uber's claim, department spokeswoman Amanda Cole also forwarded an email from Lt. Brent Dupre, then in the department’s Highway Command, stating: ""We cannot say any drop"" in DWI collisions ""is due to the ridesharing groups."" Different timeframes, different results We crunched the department’s counts of DWI collisions different ways, mostly finding decreases over the months that ride-sharing services have been available. For instance, according to the department, Austin experienced 454 DWI collisions in 2014; that count was 24 percent less than the 597 DWI collisions in 2013, much as KVUE reported. Then again, most recently, there were 445 DWI collisions in Austin from January through October 2015, the latest month of available data when we inquired--a nearly 6 percent increase from the 422 such collisions over the comparable stretch of 2014. Still, DWI collisions in Austin over the first 10 months of 2015 ran nearly 12 percent behind the 503 DWI collisions in the comparable part of 2013, according to the department. Next, we compared tallies for the 12 months after the council’s grant of permission to ride-sharing services took effect in November 2014 to the previous 12 months. According to the police, there were 497 DWI collisions in the city after ride-sharing was legal compared to 496 DWI collisions in the previous period--no change. But we also compared DWI collisions over the 17 months from June 2014, when Uber started picking up passengers in Austin, through October 2015 to the preceding 17 months. According to the police, there were 821 DWI collisions in the city from 2013 through May 2014 and 675 DWI collisions from June 2014 through October 2015, or 18 percent fewer. Our ruling Uber said: ""Recent news reports indicate DWI crashes in Austin dropped 23 percent since ridesharing entered the market."" That aligns with a local news report. Yet different timeframes for making statistical comparisons suggest a range of results--even, in one slice, more DWI collisions than before. It's worth repeating that Uber is referring to correlations between ride-sharing’s availability and collisions, not necessarily causation. We rate this statement Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Ted Cruz misfires on definition of 'carpet bombing' in GOP debate
","In the wake of the apparently ISIS-inspired terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Republican presidential candidates have sparred over how best to take on the terrorist group. In early December, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, began saying that his military approach to ISIS would be ""carpet bombing."" He said during a speech in Iowa on Dec. 5 that ""we will utterly destroy ISIS. We will carpet bomb them into oblivion. I don't know if sand can glow in the dark, but we're going to find out."" Critics, including other Republican presidential candidates, blasted Cruz. On Meet the Press, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said that Cruz ""talks tough on some of these issues. For example, he was going to carpet-bomb ISIS. But the only budget he's ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it."" Hillary Clinton, speaking at the University of Minnesota, also blasted Cruz: ""Shallow slogans don't add up to a strategy. Promising to carpet bomb until the desert glows doesn't make you sound strong -- it makes you sound like you're in over your head."" Then, during the CNN-sponsored debate in Las Vegas, moderator Wolf Blitzer tried to pin Cruz down on his ""carpet bombing"" proposal. ""To be clear, Sen. Cruz, would you carpet-bomb Raqqa, the ISIS capital, where there are a lot of civilians? Yes or no?"" Cruz responded, ""You would carpet bomb where ISIS is -- not a city, but the location of the troops. You use air power directed -- and you have embedded special forces to direction the air power. But the object isn't to level a city. The object is to kill the ISIS terrorists."" But there’s a problem: What Cruz described isn’t carpet bombing. What he described is actually the opposite of carpet bombing. What is ‘carpet bombing’? We’ll start by noting that the term ""carpet bombing"" is an informal one -- ""a non-military euphemism,"" said retired Maj. Gen. Robert Scales, a former commandant of the Army War College. Still, it has a generally understood definition, experts say. The defining characteristic of carpet bombing is that it’s indiscriminate -- not targeted. "" ‘Carpet bombing’ typically refers to bombing a defined area without discriminating between targets,"" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. Ted Bromund, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, concurred. ""It implies the use of mass, conventional air-strikes not directed against specific targets, delivered with sufficient intensity to completely cover -- 'carpet’ -- an area,"" he said. The first use of the term dates to around World War II, the first global conflict in which air power had advanced to the point where massive, indiscriminate bombing was feasible. Military historians differ on which previous military actions by the United States qualify as carpet bombing, but a number of historical examples may fit the bill. In World War II, Allied strikes during and following the invasion of Normandy killed an estimated 40,000 French civilians. Later in the war, a three-day, joint U.S.-British attack on Dresden, Germany, stirred up monumental fires that killed more than 125,000 people. And in Tokyo, a March 1945 attack by 250 planes, each carrying six tons of incendiary bombs, burned almost 16 square miles and killed more than 80,000 people. Other examples from the Korean War and the Vietnam War are sometimes cited. Given the downsides of carpet bombing -- especially large civilian casualties, which don’t reflect well on the bombing nation in a media-interconnected world -- it’s not a military tactic used often today. For one thing, it’s arguably outlawed by the 1977 Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. But the more important factor is that today’s precision-guided ""smart"" bombs and delivery systems provide better targeting without any loss in explosive power. The World War II examples of indiscriminate attacks were undertaken ""because more precise bombing was not possible,"" said John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org. ""The U.S. tried precision daylight bombing where they tried to hit individual factories, but they were too vulnerable to enemy fighters and anti-aircraft artillery, so they joined the Royal Air Force in burning down German cities at night."" By contrast, today, ""we can do more damage with a single strike than we could with hundreds of aircraft in World War II,"" Janda said. ""The only advantage might be psychological. But again, while scaring millions may have an emotional appeal, it also risks alienating millions and making more enemies for ourselves. There’s also the argument that we’re supposed to be the good guys."" So when Cruz describes bombing troops specifically rather than cities, and potentially using ""embedded special forces"" to select discrete targets, he’s not talking about carpet bombing -- he’s ""describing what we are already doing,"" Janda said. ""Now, he might launch more airstrikes, and if ISIS suddenly gathered 10,000 guys out in the open, I suppose you could forget targeting and just bomb everything in that area. But they aren’t going to do that."" Cruz’s use of the phrase ""carpet bombing"" is designed ""to get a reaction from people,"" Janda said. ""He’s not using it literally or correctly."" Our ruling Cruz defined his desired approach for fighting ISIS -- ""carpet bombing"" -- as bombing ""not a city, but the location of the troops,"" with ""embedded special forces to direct the air power."" Since the defining characteristic of carpet bombing is the dropping of bombs indiscriminately, Cruz’s definition is essentially the opposite of carpet bombing. We rate his claim False. CORRECTION, Dec. 18, 2015: This story has been updated to correct the description of a March 1945 attack on Tokyo. The attack involved six tons of incendiary bombs for each of the 250 planes involved, not a total of six tons of bombs.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0D9680>],/factchecks/2015/dec/16/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-misfires-definition-carpet-bombing-gop-de/

Marco Rubio wrongly says Ted Cruz supports 'legalizing people who are in this country illegally'
","During the Republican debate in Las Vegas, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida accused one of his rivals, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, of being soft on immigration policy. ""Ted, you support legalizing people who are in this country illegally,"" Rubio said. ""Ted Cruz supported a 500 percent increase in the number of H1B visas, the guest workers that are allowed in this country. And Ted supports doubling the number of green cards."" Cruz responded, ""I understand that Marco wants to raise confusion. It is not accurate what he just said that I supported legalization. Indeed, I led the fight against his legalization and amnesty bill."" When pressed by Rubio about whether he had ruled out legalization, Cruz said, ""I have never supported legalization, and I do not intend to support legalization."" That was a more clearly worded statement then many of Cruz’s past comments about legalization. Cruz’s immigration plan released in November called for increasing deportations of criminals but didn’t address how he would handle all 11 million illegally here and whether they would get legal status. However, Rubio’s statement that Cruz supports ""legalizing people who are in this country illegally"" is a head-snapper, since Cruz holds himself out as tougher than the rest of his rivals on giving ground to people living in the United States without legal authorization. Rubio was one of the eight senators who co-authored a bill in 2013 that created a path to citizenship. The bill passed the Senate but died in the House. We’ve noted before that Cruz was the only one among the GOP presidential field who never plainly supported something like a path to citizenship or another form of legal status. In September 2015, PolitiFact rated Mostly True Cruz’s claim that he alone among 10 candidates -- including Rubio -- never backed ""amnesty"" for immigrants. We’ll focus on whether Cruz supported legalization for illegal immigrants. (Rubio also said that Cruz supported more visas and green cards, but that’s not the same thing as legalizing people who are in the country illegally. We’ll leave the visa issue aside for now.) Much of the debate between Rubio and Cruz on this point revolves around an amendment Cruz offered to the 2013 bill to change immigration law -- and whether he truly intended that to provide legal status or proposed it as a legislative strategy without ever intending to support the bill anyway. Cruz’s statements about 2013 bill Let’s start by walking through what Cruz has proposed over the years about legal status for immigrants living in the United States without legal authorization. Cruz was a vocal critic of the 2013 bill to change immigration laws written by Rubio and seven other senators. Cruz spoke out often against the bill and proposed amendments to triple border security, among changes. On May 21, 2013, Cruz issued a press release saying that he’d offered amendments to the Senate measure that day to ""ensure that illegal immigrants are not given a path to citizenship, and modernize, streamline and expand legal immigration by reforming the green card program."" Cruz told the Senate Judiciary Committee that if the path to citizenship were eliminated from the Senate plan, as he proposed, some 11 million residents living ""in the shadows"" would ""still be eligible for RPI status."" (RPI stands for Registered Provisional Immigrant program, which gives a work permit to a successful applicant to travel outside the United States and return.) The Senate plan included RPI status for 10 years and then immigrants would be eligible to apply for permanent residency, as in a green card. In June 2013, Cruz told NPR News that if senators embraced his proposal stripping out the path to citizenship option, the ""11 million who are here illegally would be granted legal status once the border was secured — not before — but after the border was secured, they would be granted legal status. And indeed, they would be eligible for permanent legal residency. But they would not be eligible for citizenship."" That amendment and comments Cruz made related it to it are the crux of Rubio’s argument about why he says Cruz supports legislation. The Texas Tribune/New York Times wrote in September 2013 that Cruz -- who tries to appeal to tea party conservatives and represents a state with a large Latino population -- was trying to ""claim the middle ground on immigration."" Asked about what to do with the people here illegally, however, he (Cruz) stressed that he had never tried to undo the goal of allowing them to stay. ""The amendment that I introduced removed the path to citizenship, but it did not change the underlying work permit from the Gang of Eight,"" he said in 2013 in El Paso. After the Las Vegas debate, Rubio’s campaign cited comments Cruz made in November 2015. But we found that Cruz’s statements were vague because they left open the possibility of legalization. But he didn’t come out and support it outright. For example, at an event in Iowa Cruz said: ""Let’s demonstrate we can stop illegal immigration, we can protect our national security interests, we can protect our law enforcement interests,"" Cruz said. ""Then once that’s done, we can have a conversation at that point about whatever people remain here illegally."" Cruz’s amendment appeared to be a tactic Cruz campaign spokesman Brian Phillips said that each example of Cruz mentioning work permits in the Senate plan amounted to Cruz simply explaining what would remain in the Senate plan if the path to citizenship element were yanked -- and, Phillips said, Cruz never said he would vote for the plan, regardless. Cruz has changed his mind on some aspects of immigration laws. In 2013, he supported expanding H1B visas but this year called for a suspension due to abuse. He also called for increasing the number of green cards but now says we should not increase the level of immigration as long as unemployment remains high. Mark Krikorian, who advocated against the 2013 bill, told Bloomberg News in November that Cruz’s amendment to remove the path to citizenship element was a legislative tactic. ""You often introduce measures you hope will be poison pills if you're trying to kill a piece of legislation,"" said Krikorian who works for the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that focuses on lessening immigration. Stephen Miller, a spokesman for U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., told Bloomberg News that ""numerous conservatives offered amendments to the progressive Gang of Eight bill that were designed to improve enforcement or combat amnesty."" He continued, ""That does not mean these senators supported the bill with those changes. That would be an extremely untenable interpretation."" (Sessions also fought against the bill.) Chris Chmielenski of NumbersUSA, an advocacy group that promotes reduced immigration, previously told PolitiFact he doesn’t think Cruz ""was ever willing to support legalization"" of immigrants living here ""before enforcement"" of border security. Chmielenski said that there also was no Cruz amendment proposing to give work permits to people living here without legal authorization. Cruz voted against the overall bill, which passed the Senate 68 to 32 in June 2013 and then died in the House. Our ruling Rubio said Cruz ""is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally.""  Cruz proposed an amendment in 2013 to the immigration bill that would have stripped the citizenship provision. But it would have kept intact the language in the Senate bill that allowed illegal immigrants to still apply for the Registered Provisional Immigrant program in the overall bill, which would have resulted in a work permit and 10 years later application for permanent residency. But it’s a stretch for Rubio to label Cruz as a supporter of legalization when he was an ardent critic of the overall bill for months and voted against it. Cruz’s amendment appeared to be a legislative tactic.

Carly Fiorina claims military generals 'retired early' after being frank with Obama
","The Republican candidates divided their time during the CNN Las Vegas presidential debate criticizing each other and criticizing President Barack Obama. Former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina combined both in her answer to how she would defeat ISIS. ""To wage war, we need a commander in chief who has made tough calls in tough times and stood up to be held accountable over and over, not first-term senators who've never made an executive decision in their life,"" Fiorina said. ""One of the things I would immediately do, in addition to defeating them here at home, is bring back the warrior class -- Petraeus, McChrystal, Mattis, Keane, Flynn. Every single one of these generals I know. Every one was retired early because they told President Obama things that he didn't want to hear."" That is an interesting list of military leaders. We looked into their reasons for leaving. Fiorina might have a point for some of them, but certainly two of her examples don’t hold up. Gen. John Keane In a military career that spanned 37 years, Keane rose to become acting chief of staff and vice chief of staff of the U.S. Army. The trouble for Fiorina is Keane resigned in 2003. Obama took office in 2009. Keane never served under Obama. Gen. David Petraeus Petraeus was appointed by President George W. Bush to lead the multinational forces in Iraq. He became chief of the military’s Central Command in 2007 and was appointed by Obama to be commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan. Obama nominated Petraeus to head the Central Intelligence Agency in 2011. Petraeus retired from the military to take on the new position. Petraeus was forced to resign from the CIA in 2012 when investigators uncovered that he had shared classified materials with a woman who was writing his biography, and in fact was having an extramarital affair with her. Gen. Stanley McChrystal McChrystal was Obama’s pick to lead American and NATO forces in Afghanistan at a time when the war was taking a mounting toll on U.S. soldiers. McChrystal advocated for a strategy that called for as many as 40,000 additional troops. Many in the White House disagreed, among them Vice President Joe Biden. Ultimately, McChrystal got much of what he recommended. His downfall came when he allowed a Rolling Stone reporter to travel with him. When the article emerged, McChrystal and his staff were quoted making disparaging remarks about Biden and other top civilian administration officials. Such a public rift between top military and civilian officials created a management crisis in the White House. Obama removed McChrystal from his post. In Rose Garden remarks, the president said ""the conduct represented in the recently published article does not meet the standard that should be set by a commanding general."" McChrystal’s story partly follows Fiorina’s narrative. He did disagree with some of Obama’s top advisers. On the other hand, Obama largely did what McChrystal wanted. We can’t know the complete inside story, but the immediate issue that cost McChrystal his job wasn’t that he spoke up, but that he spoke too publicly. Gen. James Mattis Mattis was part of the command shuffle that took place after Obama fired McChrystal. Petraeus, who had been the head of Central Command moved over to run operations in Afghanistan. Obama put Mattis in charge of Central Command. Obama removed Mattis from that job in 2013. By some reports, there was concern in the White House that Mattis seemed too eager to use military force against Iran. But another account has it that he rubbed  civilian officials the wrong way with the issues he raised about Iran. While we don’t know all the details, it seems possible that Mattis was removed over policy differences. Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn Flynn was a key intelligence adviser to McChrystal in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2012, he became the  head of the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency. According to the Washington Post, Flynn wanted to reorganize the agency, placing more operatives overseas and focusing on a range of threats beyond the conflict zones of Iraq and Afghanistan. His management style and strategic plans put him at odds with his bosses, importantly, Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael Vickers. Flynn and his deputy left the agency at the same time. Flynn’s story largely aligns with Fiorina’s message. Our ruling Fiorina said that five generals -- Petraeus, McChrystal, Mattis, Keane, and Flynn -- resigned because they all told Obama things he didn’t want to hear. Fiorina might be pushing the point of whether Obama himself didn’t like what they had to say, but two of the men -- Mattis and Flynn -- likely departed over policy differences, published reporting shows. McChrystal’s story is harder to judge because Obama took his advice. There was friction over policy, but he was removed from his post due to an interview with Rolling Stone that at the very least put Obama in a difficult position. Petraeus’ departure had nothing to do with policy. He mishandled classified documents and had an affair. Keane retired long before Obama took office. Fiorina is on solid ground with only two of her examples, and also indicated an Obama involvement that is not proven. That’s shaky enough to rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096963340>],/factchecks/2015/dec/16/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-claims-military-generals-retired-ear/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Rand Paul']","
Rand Paul said that Marco Rubio is for an 'open border'
","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio has been a target of some of his fellow GOP presidential candidates for his leadership on trying to change immigration laws in 2013. During the CNN debate in Las Vegas Dec. 15, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said that Rubio has opposed border security: ""He thinks he wants to be this ‘Oh I am great and strong on national defense,’ but he is the weakest of all the candidates on immigration. He is the one for an open border that is leaving us defenseless."" Is Rubio for an open border? In a word, no. An open border allows people to travel freely or with very few restrictions between two countries. Rubio wasn’t for an open border in 2013, nor does he support it this year while running for president. 2013 immigration law In 2013, Rubio and seven other senators (dubbed the Gang of Eight) crafted bipartisan legislation that passed the Senate. The bill required more border security before unauthorized immigrants could pursue legal status -- a path that included significant hurdles. As for border security, the bill included billions for border enforcement over a decade, for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as adding 20,000 border agents. GOP Sens. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee introduced the compromise amendment that included the beefed up security measures. The senators said that the additional border agents -- which would have doubled the number at the time -- would have cost $25 billion. At the time, Rubio told Fox News, ""If you look at what’s being proposed here, this is a dramatic expansion and improvement in border security that I hope will allow finally for this legislation to have the support it needs."" The Hill reported that Corker and Hoeven said Rubio played an active role in negotiating the amendment. In an interview on June 20, 2013, about a week before the Senate vote, Fox News’ Martha MacCallum asked Rubio if the bill would protect the border. ""Well, it’s a dramatic improvement in border security,"" Rubio said. ""It’s a major surge in border enforcement, and I think it’s important to explain why that’s necessary. Look, as I said before, America’s a special country, so special that people are willing to come here no matter what. Even some people are willing to risk their lives and do it illegally. And we’re compassionate about that, but we’re also a sovereign country. We have a right to protect our borders, every sovereign country does, and that’s why this is so critical."" The bill died after House leadership refused to bring the bill to a vote. Rubio still supports changing immigration laws, but on the campaign trail he has called for a piecemeal approach and emphasized that he thinks border security must be beefed up before other changes to immigration laws. During the debate, he repeated many of those points when CNN’s Dana Bash asked Rubio if he still supports a path to citizenship. Rubio said that Americans won’t trust the federal government to change immigration laws until illegal immigration is under control. ""We know what it takes to do that,"" Rubio said. ""It takes at least 20,000 more additional border agents. It takes completing 100 miles of fencing. It takes a mandatory E-Verify system and a mandatory entry exit tracking system to prevent visa overstays."" A spokesman for Rubio pointed to this statement when we asked about Paul's claim. Paul's team pointed to Rubio's work on the Gang of Eight bill as support for Paul's statement. But that legislation did not create or even suggest open borders.  ""If Sen. Rubio was really for open borders, the Gang of Eight bill wouldn't have been 1,198 pages long while doubling the size of border patrol,"" said Alex Nowrasteh, an expert on immigration at the libertarian Cato Institute.   Steven Camarota, at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration, said that ""open borders is always an overstatement."" But the bill would have dramatically increased immigration, he said. Our ruling Paul said that Rubio ""is the one for an open border."" An open border allows people to travel freely or with very few restrictions between two countries. Rubio doesn’t support anything like that. He was one of the authors of a 2013 bill that included billions for border security and more border agents. After that bill died in the House, Rubio has repeatedly said that the border must be secured before the Senate can revisit changing immigration laws. The idea that Rubio supports an open border is inaccurate and ridiculous, so we rate Paul’s statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AAE740>],/factchecks/2015/dec/16/rand-paul/rand-paul-said-marco-rubio-open-border/

Jeb Bush largely right in CNN debate that Donald Trump said 'ISIS was not our fight' 2 months ago
","Republican presidential candidates Jeb Bush and Donald Trump faced off over what Trump did -- or didn’t -- say about ISIS during the CNN debate in Las Vegas. Bush said, ""Two months ago, Donald Trump said that ISIS was not our fight. Just two months ago."" Trump responded, ""Never said that."" Who’s right? We dug into the archives and found two quotes that shed some light on what Trump really said. The comments that fit squarely within Bush’s time frame came on Sept. 28, 2015, when Trump sat for an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett. Here’s an excerpt from Trump’s comments: ""(Syria is) a total catastrophe. It's a total mess, and we are helping to make it a mess. Now, we have ISIS and ISIS wants to go after (Syrian president Bashar al-Assad). But we're knocking the hell out of them even though it's not a very full blown thing. We're still dropping bombs all over the place. ... ""You have Russia that is now there. Russia is on the side of Assad and Russia wants to get rid of ISIS as much as we do, if not more, because they don't want them coming into Russia. And I'm saying, why are we knocking ISIS and yet at the same time, we're against Assad? Let them fight, take over the remnants, but more importantly, let Russia fight ISIS if they want to fight them. Let them fight it. ... ""Let Syria and ISIS fight. Why do we care? Let ISIS and Syria fight. And let Russia, they're in Syria already, let them fight ISIS. Look, I don't want ISIS. ISIS is bad. They are evil. When they start doing with a head chopping … these are really bad dudes. … Let Russia take care of ISIS. How many places can we be? … Russia likes Assad seemingly a lot. Let them worry about ISIS. Let them fight it out."" When we checked with the Bush campaign, spokesman Matt Gorman said that the interview with Burnett was indeed the source that Bush was referencing during his debate comments. As it happens, another set of comments actually offer a closer fit in wording to what Bush referenced, but they came more than five months ago, in a July 8, 2015, interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper. Here’s what Trump told Cooper when he asked him to expand upon his previous remark that nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump: ""The situation with ISIS has to be dealt firmly and strongly. When you have people being beheaded -- I would love not to be over there. That's not our fight. That's other people's fight. That's revolutions, that's whatever you want to call it, religious wars."" So it appears that Bush conflated two examples of prior Trump comments. In the quote from ""two months ago,"" Trump didn’t say that ISIS is ""not our fight."" He did, however, say those words on a different occasion -- but that was more than five months ago, not two. More important, though, is whether Bush accurately captured the essence of Trump’s meaning. In the quote from two months ago -- the one the Bush camp says he was referencing in the debate exchange -- Trump does appear to suggest that Russia and Syria should be the countries to primarily fight ISIS. ""Let Syria and ISIS fight,"" he said. ""Why do we care? Let ISIS and Syria fight. And let Russia, they're in Syria already, let them fight ISIS."" Our ruling Bush said, ""Two months ago, Donald Trump said that ISIS was not our fight"" -- something Trump immediately denied. Trump didn't use those words two months ago -- even though he did five months ago -- but in the comments from two months ago, Trump said something close to what Bush indicated. We rate Bush’s comment Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967E79C0>],/factchecks/2015/dec/16/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-claims-cnn-debate-donald-trump-said-isis-/

Whoopi Goldberg wrongly claims the Holocaust was ‘not about race’
","Whoopi Goldberg, the co-host of ABC’s ""The View,"" repeatedly and falsely claimed that the Nazi Germans systematic persecution of Jews during the Holocaust was ""not about race."" Goldberg’s comments generated widespread backlash, including from Jewish leaders and groups. She has since apologized for the comments, which came during a Jan. 31 segment about a Tennessee school district’s decision to ban ""Maus,"" a graphic novel about the Holocaust. ""If you're going to do this, then let's be truthful about it, because the Holocaust isn't about race. No, it’s not about race,"" Goldberg said in her initial remarks. Facing pushback from her fellow co-hosts, she argued that it was about ""man's inhumanity to man,"" since ""these are two white groups of people.""  ""Racism was central to Nazi ideology,"" the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum responded in a tweet as Goldberg’s statement garnered attention online. ""Jews were not defined by religion, but by race. Nazi racist beliefs fueled genocide and mass murder.""  The Auschwitz Memorial, meanwhile, tagged Goldberg in a tweet advertising its seven-chapter online course on the history of the Holocaust, in which the Nazis murdered some 6 million Jews. Later that night, Goldberg posted an apology on Twitter that quoted from Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, who had tweeted that the Holocaust ""was about the Nazi’s systematic annihilation of the Jewish people — who they deemed to be an inferior race."" The following day, ""The View"" brought Greenblatt on the show, and Goldberg apologized again. ""I said that the Holocaust wasn’t about race and was instead about man’s inhumanity to man, but it is indeed about race, because Hitler and the Nazis considered Jews to be an inferior race,"" Goldberg said. ""I regret my comments, as I said, and I stand corrected."" A spokesperson for ABC did not respond to a request for comment. Historians said Goldberg’s original claim distorted the history of the Holocaust, which was fueled by the Nazis’ racist ideology and policies. ""As far as the Nazis were concerned, non-Jewish Germans were an entirely different race, in a very physical sense, from Jews, no matter how long a particular Jewish person or family might have lived in Germany,"" said Benjamin Hett, a historian at Hunter College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. ""Goldberg is without doubt entirely wrong."" Racism toward Jews and other groups drove the Nazis’ ideology, policies, and mass murder of Jews in concentration camps and elsewhere, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. ""Nazi antisemitism rested completely on the argument that they are not people like you Germans,"" said Peter Hayes, a professor emeritus of history and German at Northwestern University. ""They are implacably and by inheritance different and hostile, and therefore they have to be ‘removed,’ one way or another."" Nazi theories of race held that Germans and other people of Indo-European descent belonged to a superior group called the ""Aryan"" race. The Nazi heirarchy of races positioned the Aryans at the top, Black people at the bottom and everyone else on a scale in between, Hayes said.  Jewish people were branded as the most dangerous threat to the Aryan race, Hayes said. They were considered conniving, hate-filled, parasitic, and capable of mobilizing the other races.  Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, in particular, saw Jewish people as ""subhuman"" entities who threatened all other races by spreading subversive ideas like liberalism and Marxism, and by mixing with other races through marriage and sexual relations, said Christopher Browning, a professor emeritus of history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""For Hitler, all history was a race struggle,"" Browning said. Hitler described Jews as a race — not a religion — in ""Mein Kampf,"" the autobiographical political manifesto that charted his ideology and his vision for the future of Germany. One key chapter comparing the races was titled ""Nation and Race."" ""Hitler was very explicit about this, and always said very clearly that being Jewish had nothing to do with religious affiliation or cultural background, but was entirely physical,"" Hett said. The Nazis went to great lengths to try to prove through pseudoscience that Jewish people had such physical markers, even devoting an office of the government to such work, Hett said.  They also implemented the Nuremberg Race Laws, which provided the legal framework for the systematic persecution of Jews, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.  The first of the two laws codified a definition for Jewishness based on race and heritage that stripped them of German citizenship. The second prohibited marriage and criminalized sexual relations between Jews and non-Jewish Germans. In one of several pages about Nazi racism on its website, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum writes: ""Hitler's program of war and genocide stemmed from what he saw as an equation: ‘Aryan’ Germans would have to expand and dominate, a process requiring the elimination of all racial threats — especially the Jews — or else they would face extinction themselves.""  Wreaths placed at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe on the International Holocaust Remembrance Day in Berlin, Germany, on Jan. 27, 2022. (AP) Even Jews who converted to Christianity were rounded up during the Holocaust because of their parents or grandparents, rather than their religious practice. Goldberg said, ""The Holocaust isn't about race. No, it's not about race.""  The Nazi Germans’ persecution of millions of Jews was premised on a racist ideology that viewed Jews as an inferior race and the biggest threat to the so-called Aryan race and other races, and laws that set about defining Jews not by their religion, but by their heritage. Hitler himself expressed the belief that the Jews were a lesser race, historians said. Goldberg conceded her error and apologized. The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

He says it ""shows COVID infection rates in the U.K. are higher among the ‘fully vaccinated’ in all adult cohorts."" But the data Mercola cited is only from England, not all of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom consists of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Also, that report does not contain data about COVID-19 cases by vaccination status. Information about cases, deaths and hospitalization by vaccination status is in a separate weekly government report called ""COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report."" Data from England shows the rate of hospitalization and death is ""substantially greater"" in unvaccinated people compared with vaccinated people, according to the U.K. Health Security Agency. The rate of positive tests in England is higher in vaccinated people aged 30 and older, according to the U.K. Health Security Agency. However, that is expected in a country with very high vaccine coverage, the agency said. The rate of hospitalization and death remains much higher among the unvaccinated than the vaccinated. For example, among people ages 40 to 49 who were diagnosed with COVID-19, about 11 per 100,000 who were vaccinated were admitted to the hospital, compared with about 33 per 100,000 who were unvaccinated. The difference becomes more pronounced as age increases. The data on deaths shows similar disparities.

Dozens of protesters showed up outside the Extended Stay America hotel a day later, waving signs opposing illegal immigration and President Joe Biden, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Trump falsely says Electoral Count Act talks prove he was right on Pence’s power
","On Jan. 6, 2021, former President Donald Trump thought his last hope to reverse his election defeat hinged on Vice President Mike Pence, and a creative reading of a 100-year-old law, the Electoral Count Act.  Trump argued that Pence could set aside the electoral votes from enough states — including Arizona, Pennsylvania and Michigan — to erase Joe Biden’s winning margin. Pence pushed back, saying he lacked the power to do that, and went ahead with the certification of Biden’s victory. Today, as a bipartisan group of senators led by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, discuss revising the Electoral Count Act, Trump said the fact that they are even trying shows he was right. ""What they are saying, is that Mike Pence did have the right to change the outcome, and they now want to take that right away,"" Trump said in a Jan. 30 statement. ""Unfortunately, he didn’t exercise that power, he could have overturned the Election!"" That is not what these senators are saying. What they do say is that the Electoral Count Act is poorly written, and that the limits on Congress and the vice president need to be spelled out more clearly to prevent the law from being abused.  Many of Trump’s critics took his words about overturning the election to be a rare admission that he lost, and that he had sought to undo a legitimate result. But here, we focus solely on what he said about the vice president’s power under the Electoral Count Act, and what lawmakers are trying to do to update the law. The Electoral Count Act of 1887 grew out of a string of disputed and close presidential elections from 1876 to 1884. It governs the final certification process after an election, the process that was interrupted on Jan. 6 by rioters. The law lays out the steps for each state to finalize their results, certify a slate of electors representing those results, and send that list to Washington. It says that on Jan. 6, the results from each state are opened, and the president of the Senate (typically the vice president) ""shall thereupon announce the state of the vote.""  The law’s more complicated parts deal with what Congress should do if there is more than one slate of electors coming from official bodies in a given state, an issue that caused commotion during elections in the late 1800s.  In that situation, the Senate and House would each vote on who the lawful electors are. If the Senate and House disagreed, then the slate certified by the state’s executive would be counted. But Trump’s team asserted that the text gives the option for none of the votes to be counted in that circumstance. That provision was the opening Trump hoped to use to derail the certification of Biden’s win and usurp the presidency. In a memo authored by Trump lawyer John Eastman, the plan was that when the tallies from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada and New Mexico were opened, Pence would announce ""he has multiple slates of electors."" Pence would set aside the votes and declare that there were no results from those states. (A set of faked electoral certificates from those states were part of this plan.) But on Jan. 6, 2021, there were no competing slates of electors from any state. As each state’s certificate was opened, Pence acknowledged that it was ""the only certificate of vote from that State that purports to be a return from the State.""  In a March 2021 paper about the Electoral Count Act, Boston University law professors Jack Beerman and Gary Lawson pointed out the legal implications of that. ""If there is no controversy coming from a particular state’s legislature about the validity of that state’s certification, there is probably nothing for the Vice President, or the federal courts, to decide,"" they wrote. As a separate matter, senators and representatives could raise objections about whether some states had followed their own voting rules, and they did on Jan. 6. Both chambers voted down those challenges. Regardless, that section of the law granted no authority to the vice president to unilaterally set votes aside. ""He has no power to ‘change the outcome’ or to ‘overturn the election,’"" said Michael McConnell, a former Republican-appointed federal judge and director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School. ""Once the electors chosen by the states met and voted on Dec. 14, 2020, the election was over."" To Benjamin Ginsberg, a legal scholar and former Republican Party lawyer, Trump’s effort to seize the presidency by pressuring Pence was evidence that the Electoral Count Act is too poorly written to help the country weather a constitutional crisis. ""The former president made a hollow argument that tried to exploit what he tried to say was ambiguity in the law,"" Ginsberg said. ""He didn’t succeed because his argument was wrong. But since it has been raised and the language could be modernized, it makes good sense to restate the current law in even more clear, contemporary terms."" That is what Collins and a group of Republican and Democratic senators are working on. (One motivator for the bipartisan push: The current vice president is a Democrat.) ""We need to make very clear that the vice president’s role is just ministerial, that he has no power, she has no power, to overturn the votes that are submitted by the states,"" Collins said in a Jan. 26 television interview. Collins added that the current law makes it too easy for lawmakers to interrupt the counting process. All it takes to trigger a two-hour debate is one senator and one representative to challenge the results from a given state.  There are other issues with the law. Ginsberg and other scholars say that the law fails to say who at the state level — the governor or the secretary of state — has final say over the slate of electors. It is vague about the grounds for challenging slates sent from any given state. Above all, it fails to set clear limits on Congress’ power to reject the results certified by each state. There is broad support for clarifying the Electoral Count Act, in Congress and beyond. The American Enterprise Institute, a market-oriented think tank, the libertarian Cato Institute and the Wall Street Journal editorial board have all expressed interest in rewriting the law.  One final point: Trump’s statement assumed that any effort to change the law could only mean that people thought he was right about Pence’s powers. Logically, there could be more than one reason to change the law. As Ohio State University constitutional legal scholar Edward Foley tweeted, ""It's entirely consistent to think BOTH that Pence had no such authority, and ALSO that the Electoral Count Act should be clarified on this crucial point."" We reached out to Trump’s office and did not hear back. Trump said that discussions about changes to the Electoral Count Act show that Pence had the power to overturn the 2020 election results.  Legal scholars say that the law is poorly worded, and is vague on key points. But there’s broad legal agreement that the law never gave Pence the power to overturn the election. Lawmakers seeking to modify the law say they want to reduce the ambiguities and raise the bar for senators and representatives to challenge results from any given state. We rate this claim False.

Fact-checking whether Biden’s Build Back Better would be largest expansion of welfare in 60 years
","To break out of the pack of GOP candidates running for an open U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania, Republican Carla Sands ran an ad attacking what she called President Joe Biden’s ""socialist"" Build Back Better legislation. Sands, who is former President Donald Trump's ambassador to Denmark, made a claim about welfare that we wanted to check. In the 30-second video, which is featured on her campaign website and which ran for a month on YouTube, Sands stands behind a table that holds a stack of paper and a shredding machine.  ""This stack of paper is the 2,100 pages in Joe Biden’s $4 trillion spending bill,"" Sands states as she holds up a page entitled H.R. 5376. That is the bill number for Build Back Better.  As she feeds the shredder, Sands makes several claims about the bill, the most specific being that it is ""the largest expansion of welfare programs in 60 years."" There are three issues we looked at in evaluating this claim: the size of the bill, how much it devotes to programs that might be considered welfare, and how that compares historically. We concluded that Sands gets a basic fact wrong, while her broader point about welfare spending isn’t clearly supported. First, Build Back Better would spend $1.75 trillion over 10 years, not $4 trillion.  As for how much it devotes to welfare, that’s difficult to say, because there’s no clear definition of welfare. The bill would raise spending for social safety-net programs, including for low-income people, but it also includes $555 billion to fight climate change, nearly a third of the total. That complicates the third question, how it compares historically to other legislation. ""There is no question that the package is among the most significant expansions of social welfare since the Great Society/War on Poverty programs in the 1960s,"" said Stephen Monroe Tomczak, a professor of social welfare policy at Southern Connecticut State University and president of the national Social Welfare History Group. ""But whether it is, in fact, the largest is dependent on what elements of the initiative are considered ‘welfare programs.’  Some of the programs and policies proposed are commonly defined as such; others are not."" To back Sands’ claim, her campaign cited to PolitiFact a report about Build Back Better by the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank. The report uses the $4 trillion figure to back its conclusions, citing an ""illustrative scenario"" done by the Penn Wharton Budget Model at the University of Pennsylvania.  But that estimate is based on all provisions in the bill remaining permanent, and it comes with a disclaimer that it is not an estimate of the Build Back Better legislation. The House approved a version of the Build Back Better Act in November. No action has been taken in the Senate, as Biden continues to press for support.  This version of the bill would spend $1.75 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. With an estimated $658 billion in expanded tax credits for individuals and businesses, the net revenue increase would be about $1 trillion, according to the Tax Foundation. Experts on the federal budget and social programs have criticized what they say are budget gimmicks that kept the price tag down to $1.75 trillion. For example, they note, the bill makes tax hikes permanent, but makes certain provisions such as a child tax credit, temporary. ""It is well known that both the red team and the blue team game the CBO rules that guide how they estimate what particular pieces of legislation will cost,"" said economist Jeffrey Smith, associate director of the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Institute for Research on Poverty. Lawmakers could extend some of the temporary provisions in the future, increasing the price tag. But for now, all that’s certain is the $1.75 trillion.  Build Back Better would fund programs that provide financial assistance to people. How many of those programs amount to ""welfare"" is debatable, given that the word has different meanings for different people.  Welfare can refer to federal programs providing food, health care, housing and financial assistance to low-income families. Some people use the term to refer to cash payouts to people who aren’t working, while others think it includes government assistance of any type. A more precise definition refers to federal programs with means testing — using a person’s means, such as income, to determine eligibility.  Some Build Back Better provisions target lower-income people: $165 billion for what the White House called the biggest expansion of affordable health care in a decade. The provision reduces health care premiums under the Affordable Care Act and expands Medicare coverage to include hearing benefits. $150 billion for affordable housing and down payment and rental assistance, which the House Financial Services Committee called the largest such investment in U.S. history. $150 billion for a Medicaid program that provides affordable home health care, a provision that one Democratic senator called historic.  Other provisions could benefit lower-income groups as well as those with greater means, and they may also include means tests:  $400 billion would fund child care and preschool. Families that earn less than $300,000 annually would pay no more than 7% of their income on child care for kids under age 6. $200 billion would be used for child tax credits. Individuals with an income of up to $112,500 and couples with an income of up to $150,000 would be eligible. $200 billion would be for four weeks of paid family and medical leave. While major parts of the Build Back Better bill are for helping individuals, others are not. For example, the single-largest part of the $1.75 trillion — $555 billion — would fight climate change.  Sands’ claim that Build Back Better would be the largest expansion of welfare programs in 60 years likely refers to the Great Society, President Lyndon Johnson’s domestic agenda from the mid-1960s. That effort included not only a War on Poverty, but initiatives for environmental protection, immigration, education, highways and consumer protection, among other issues. We asked the Heritage Foundation’s Robert Rector, whose report Sands relies on, about Sands’ 60 years claim. He referred us to page 24 of his report. The report states that the bill would generate an additional $167 billion in means-tested spending in its first year, and that that ""would be by far the greatest increase in means-tested welfare spending in U.S. history."" The Heritage analysis defines welfare broadly, counting the refundable portion of the child credit; expansion of the earned income tax credit for low-income workers; the child care, pre-kindergarten and housing subsidies; and medical benefits for the Medicaid coverage gap, Rector told us. Rector said that in constant dollars, the $167 billion would be more than twice as large as any prior increase in means-tested welfare spending. The next-largest one-year increase was $83 billion in 2010 in constant 2019 dollars. Rector said the 2010 increase was mainly due to a rise in enrollments in existing programs because of the Great Recession, noting that key Obamacare provisions didn’t take effect until 2014. New means-tested spending over the first five years of Build Back Better would come to $836 billion, Rector said. In constant dollars, this would be larger than any five-year increase in such spending in U.S. history.   Rector said those figures are based on Build Back Better being $1.75 trillion. Another analysis, from the Washington Post, looks at the overall spending in Build Back Better as a share of the economy. It compared Biden’s original proposal — $3.5 trillion — to the New Deal and other major social spending programs since the 1930s. The Post found that the original Build Back Better spending would amount to 1.1% of annual gross domestic product. So taking into account that Build Back Better has been reduced to $1.75 trillion, the Post’s findings suggest that Build Back Better spending — including the climate change chunk — would amount to 0.55% of annual gross domestic product.  That’s less than the Great Society’s 0.9% and less than the 1% spent by two Obama-era programs combined, the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a stimulus bill. And on an annual basis, and relative to people’s incomes, Build Back Better is not as large as the 2020 CARES Act, which authorized $2.2 trillion in spending for just one year, said University of California, Davis, economics professor Peter Lindert, author of the 2021 book ""Making Social Spending Work."" That law, signed by Trump, included $1,200 direct payments to most Americans, enhanced unemployment aid, loans for small business and other relief measures. Sands said Biden's ""$4 trillion"" Build Back Better bill is ""the largest expansion of welfare programs in 60 years."" The legislation would spend $1.75 trillion, not $4 trillion, over 10 years. Experts said the legislation would be among the most significant expansions of social welfare programs since the 1960s, helping low-income as well as middle-income people. But definitions of what constitutes a welfare program vary, and there are a few different ways to make historical comparisons of legislation. The analysis cited by Sands is based on spending on programs that use means testing, and it shows the bill would be the largest such expansion.  The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280976F5780>],/factchecks/2022/feb/01/carla-sands/fact-checking-whether-bidens-build-back-better-wou/

Bruce Springsteen, Dave Grohl are not among the artists who removed music from Spotify
","After Neil Young demanded that Spotify remove his music over COVID-19 misinformation spread by podcaster Joe Rogan, a lot of things happened almost all at once. Spotify members started to cancel their accounts and other artists, like singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, began to follow Young’s lead. But one article circulating online goes a little too far; it wrongly claims that artists such as Bruce Springsteen and Dave Grohl removed their music from Spotify, too. ""Springsteen; Queen; Pearl Jam; Dave Grohl; All Remove Music From Spotify!"" reads a headline published on a blog called ""CelebNMusic247."" There is no evidence that these artists have asked to leave the streaming platform. The story cited a viral tweet as its source. It said: ""Breaking 🚨 Willie Nelson, Bruce Springsteen, Barbra Streisand, Queen, Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, Dave Grohl, Joni Mitchell, Pearl Jam are removing their music from Spotify in solidarity with Neil Young!!! #Spotify can keep the fascists. #DeletedSpotify."" As of Jan. 31, Mitchell is the only person listed who requested for her music to be removed. Nils Lofgren, guitarist for Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, also asked for his music to be pulled from Spotify, but Springsteen did not. Lofrgen played piano and guitar on Young’s album, ""After the Gold Rush,"" and has played on and off with Young’s band for years. Music by the other artists still appears on the platform. There have been no credible news reports or updates of otherwise on their social media accounts or websites. Rogan defended his approach to the podcast in a Jan. 30 Instagram video, though he did say his show has grown ""out of control"" and vowed to ""try harder"" to be more balanced.  Rogan has made several inaccurate claims about the COVID-19 vaccines and allowed vaccine skeptics to promote misinformation on his popular show. Video of his interview with Dr. Robert Malone, a former mRNA vaccine researcher, was banned by several social media platforms for violating COVID-19 standards — but not by Spotify. In mid January, more than 270 scientists and doctors signed an open letter asking Spotify to ""immediately establish a clear and public policy to moderate misinformation on its platform."" So far in response, Spotify has published its platform rules and said it’s working to add a content advisory to any podcast episode that includes a discussion about COVID-19. A headline claimed that Bruce Springsteen, Queen, Pearl Jam and Dave Grohl have pulled their music from Spotify. Some artists and content producers have requested that their content be removed from the streaming platform, but there is no evidence that these musicians are among them.

No evidence to support claim that CDC staged monkey crash
","Several lab monkeys escaped and were later recovered after a truck crashed on a Pennsylvania highway on Jan. 21. They were en route to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-sanctioned quarantine facility in Florida after arriving in New York from the island nation of Mauritius that morning, prompting some speculation that the incident was staged to hide something nefarious.  ""Did the CDC stage the ‘escaping monkeys’ as a cover story for releasing the next bioweapon?"" one blog post asked.  It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Certainly, it’s not every day a truck towing a trailer of 100 cynomolgus monkeys, or long-tailed macaques, collides with a dump truck on the highway. In this case, three escaped and were later found and euthanized. But there’s no credible evidence to support the claim that the CDC staged this event as cover for releasing a bioweapon, or ""a new virus strain,"" as the blog post goes on to suggest.  The post focuses in part on Michele Fallon, who came into contact with the monkeys after the crash.  ""Woman who came in contact with ‘escaping monkeys’ gets quarantined, comes down with pink eye and a cough,"" the post says. News reports did say that Fallon later developed a cough, runny nose, and something like pink eye, but she later clarified to the Daily Item, a Pennsylvania newspaper, that she wasn’t sick from her monkey exposure.  She attended a party the night of the accident and later discovered that she had been exposed to COVID-19, the paper said.  ""I want people to know I am not sick regardless of what they are reading that has been put out there in the media,"" she said. Cynomolgus monkeys are often used for medical studies, and the New York Times reported that they were in such high demand for coronavirus vaccine research at the start of the pandemic that some scientists discussed needing to create a monkey reserve, or emergency stockpile. It’s not clear whether these monkeys were part of that effort.  Claims that the CDC staged this crash to release a bioweapon are unfounded, and we rate it False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097171740>],/factchecks/2022/jan/31/blog-posting/no-evidence-support-claim-cdc-staged-monkey-crash/

Neo-Nazi, not Voltaire, originated quote about 'who rules over you'
","Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., attempted to take a swipe at Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House’s chief medical adviser, with a quote appearing to come from a deep thinker.  ""To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize,"" said the quote, which was credited to Voltaire, the French writer and philosopher, in the image Massie shared.  ""You mustn’t question Fauci, for he is science,"" Massie wrote above the quote. The same quote and citation are also circulating on Facebook. But Voltaire didn’t say this. The original speaker is Kevin Alfred Strom, a white nationalist and Holocaust denier who founded the neo-Nazi group National Vanguard in 2005, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. He pleaded guilty in 2008 to possession of child pornography and was sentenced to 23 months in prison.  The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The quote does not appear in Voltaire’s writings or correspondence, but it is widely passed off as something he said. An Australian politician misattributed the line to the Enlightenment-era thinker in 2015. Actor John Cusack made the same error four years later. Strom’s original quote was worded slightly differently. He was specifically talking about Jewish people when he said it during a 1993 broadcast on an alt-right radio program.  ""To determine the true rulers of any society, all you must do is ask yourself this question: Who is it that I am not permitted to criticize?"" Strom said. Etymologist Barry Popik noticed the misattribution to Voltaire happening in 2012 and traced the quote back to Strom. Strom lamented in a 2009 blog post that what he said was commonly misquoted. Strom claimed credit for the quote in 2017, noting that the one-liner was ""almost always attributed"" to Voltaire but was actually his. Strom said he found it ""kind of flattering"" for his thoughts to be attached to Voltaire’s name.  Massie’s tweet was shared thousands of times, including by Fox News contributor Sara A. Carter. The post was panned by many others, who pointed out the quote’s origin. ""This quote is from neo-Nazi, Holocaust-denier, and convicted pedophile Kevin Alfred Strom, not Voltaire,"" tweeted the American Jewish Committee, a Jewish advocacy group. ""We expect better of our representatives in Congress."" The University of Western Australia's Paul Gibbard, a leading expert on Voltaire, told the Guardian in 2015 that the quote from Strom was ""not un-Voltarian"" in its ""spirit"" because it captured his resistance to authority. But Gibbard added: ""There are lots of quotations that are attributed to Voltaire that aren’t actually by him, and that’s one of them.""  The University of Oxford’s Voltaire Foundation has said the same. Still, the misattributed quote has required debunking by various fact-checkers, again and again. Massie’s office did not respond to a request for comment.

"['Congress', 'Supreme Court', 'Chuck Todd']","
Supreme Court nominees confirmed by opposite party in Senate are rare
","When Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer announced in January that he would be retiring, it gave President Joe Biden his first opportunity to appoint a justice to the nation’s highest court. Once Biden makes his nomination, he’ll have a Senate majority, but a thin one — enough Democrats to meet the simple majority threshold required for confirmation as long as the party remains unified. During a discussion of who might succeed Breyer on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" host Chuck Todd offered a statistic showing how unusual it has been in recent years to have a Senate of one party confirm a nominee from a president of the other party.  ""Clarence Thomas is about to become the only member of the current Supreme Court who was nominated by a president of one party and confirmed by a Senate controlled by the other party,"" Todd said on Jan. 30. A review of the confirmation history of the current justices confirms that this is correct. After a divisive confirmation process that included allegations of sexual harassment against the nominee, Thomas was confirmed by a relatively narrow margin of 52-48. Thomas was appointed by President George H.W. Bush, a Republican, but confirmed by a Democratic-majority Senate. (Biden, then a senator, voted against confirming Thomas.) Every other current justice was either appointed by a Republican president and confirmed by a Republican Senate (John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett) or appointed by a Democratic president and confirmed by a Democratic Senate (Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan). The only caveat we could find for Todd’s statement is that Thomas isn’t ""about to become"" the only current justice to have been confirmed by a Senate of the opposite party, since he already is the only one. Breyer, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, was confirmed at a time when Democrats controlled the Senate, so his impending departure won’t change the math.   Of the six former justices who have been confirmed since 1980, four were appointed and confirmed by the same party and two were not. The outliers, Anthony Kennedy and David Souter, were both appointed by Republican presidents and confirmed by Democratic-controlled Senates. Experts say this pattern stems from growing partisan polarization both in the country at large and within the Senate itself.  ""There’s been a specific cycle of escalating reprisals that’s been going on with judicial appointments,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. For instance, when Antonin Scalia died during his tenure on the court, Barack Obama, a Democrat, was president but Republicans controlled the Senate. Obama nominated Merrick Garland to fill the seat, but Senate Republicans blocked his nomination for the better part of a year, until Donald Trump won the presidency. Senate Republicans proceeded to fill Scalia’s seat with Neil Gorsuch, a Trump nominee. Then, when Ruth Bader Ginsburg died while serving on the bench, Senate Republicans rushed to confirm Barrett just weeks before the 2020 election that would ultimately be won by Biden, a Democrat. (This maneuver earned a Full Flop for then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.) ""This is one of the reasons I favor term limits for justices, as part of a package that would make clear that each president is entitled to two appointments per four-year term,"" Roosevelt said. ""I think the appointment process has been degraded to the extent that no president in the foreseeable future will get a nomination through a Senate controlled by the opposite party."" John J. Pitney Jr., a Claremont McKenna College political scientist, expressed slightly more optimism about a cross-party confirmation, but only slightly. ""An opposing-party Senate might approve a nominee in the next several years, provided that the nominee is a moderate who would not shift the ideological makeup of the court,"" Pitney said. ""But the key word is ‘might.’ It would be no sure thing, and it is very hard to see an opposing-party Senate approving a nominee who would tilt the balance against its preferred side."" Todd said, ""Clarence Thomas is about to become the only member of the current Supreme Court who was nominated by a president of one party and confirmed by a Senate controlled by the other party."" Thomas is the only current member of the Supreme Court to be nominated by a president of one party and confirmed by a Senate of the other. All told, 12 of the 15 successful nominees since 1980 have been nominated by a president of one party and confirmed by a Senate of the same party. However, Todd’s phrasing suggests that Thomas’ status as the only justice confirmed by the opposite party would be new, when it’s actually the case now. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BFA1C0>],/factchecks/2022/jan/31/chuck-todd/supreme-court-nominees-confirmed-opposite-party-se/

Fact-checking claim about immigrants, eligibility for assistance programs
","Ahead of the tax filing season, a Facebook post sarcastically told taxpayers to file on time because immigrants illegally in the country ""are counting on you."" ""Monday, tax season starts…"" the Jan. 23 post said. ""So, please be mindful to file your taxes timely. Remember, 4.3 million of ILLEGALS are counting on you! We need to make sure they receive: Free housing, free medical, free state identification, free college, free daycare, free social security, free EBT cards, free month (sic) checks.""  It continued: ""If this doesn’t piss you off as a taxpayer and an American citizen? Then I don’t know what to tell you. All these things AREN’T government funded.... IT (sic) FUNDED BY YOU! THE TAXPAYERS!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Overall, we found that immigrants in the country illegally are ineligible to receive most of the benefits mentioned in the post. They are eligible for emergency medical care, and some women and children may qualify for food assistance. U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents aren’t the only ones covering the costs of those programs, either. Some immigrants living in the country illegally pay taxes. Estimates vary, but research indicates that immigrants in the country illegally pay billions in federal, state and local taxes each year. Generally, immigrants illegally in the country are ineligible to receive benefits from most federal programs. But they may be eligible for assistance deemed necessary to protect life or guarantee safety in dire situations, such as access to treatment in hospital emergency rooms and to health care and nutrition programs. Let’s take a closer look at their eligibility for the specific benefits mentioned in the post. Our findings come from a variety of sources, including the National Immigration Forum, the National Immigrant Law Center and federal agencies. ""Free housing."" Typically ineligible for federal Department of Housing and Urban Development housing programs. To qualify for public housing or HUD-subsidized housing, a person ""must be a U.S. citizen or a non-citizen with an eligible immigration status,"" an agency spokesperson said. An immigrant who was a trafficking victim is an example of someone with an eligible immigration status who may qualify for a housing program. (A 2000 law made victims of trafficking eligible for benefits and services under any federal or state program.)  ""Free medical."" Eligible for emergency Medicaid, if they are eligible for their state’s Medicaid program. Medicaid will cover the treatment of an emergency medical condition, including labor and delivery. ""Free state identification."" It is unclear if any states specifically allow immigrants living in the country illegally to get state IDs for free. Some states waive ID fees for certain groups of people, including seniors and people with low income. Some states allow immigrants living in the U.S. illegally to obtain driver’s licenses. ""Free college."" We found no evidence of free college specifically for this group. Washington D.C. and 17 states offer in-state tuition to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, and some offer state financial aid.  ""Free daycare."" Ineligible in most cases. Victims of trafficking who are in the U.S. illegally may qualify for benefits from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. In some cases, funds from that program can be used to pay for childcare. ""Free Social Security."" Generally, ineligible to receive social security benefits.Federal law requires that a person be a U.S. citizen or meet applicable immigration status rules to receive benefits under the programs for retirement, disability, survivors of eligible workers, Supplemental Security Income, or Medicare, a spokesperson for the Social Security Administration said. ""Free EBT cards."" Electronic Benefit Transfer cards’ most well-known use is for buying food, under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Immigrants illegally in the country are not eligible for the federal SNAP benefits. There is another federal food assistance program for which states can set eligibility requirements, and immigrants illegally in the country could apply for that assistance. That program is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, commonly called WIC. Many state agencies have started issuing WIC benefits via EBT cards, said a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. ""Free month (sic) checks."" It is unclear exactly what this refers to, but immigrants in the U.S. illegally are not eligible for cash payments or federal unemployment benefits. The federal government sets ""strict residency requirements for federal welfare programs,"" said Andrew Lim, director of research for the American Immigration Council, a non-profit group that advocates for immigrants. ""There are some instances where undocumented parents of U.S.-born children may benefit from aid that their children are eligible for, but this is never in their own right, only through their children,"" Lim said. Lim also said that there are ""innumerable individual immigration situations, so it is hard to be absolute in saying that there are absolutely zero undocumented immigrants accessing federal aid."" But a valid Social Security number is needed for nearly all federal benefits, and usually immigrants are not issued one if they are in the country illegally, he said. Eligibility is also different for state and local welfare and public assistance programs, Lim said. Some programs ""may be immigration status-blind"" or have different eligibility criteria from the federal government, which would allow immigrants in the country illegally to access some state-funded assistance. Immigrants living in the U.S. illegally would not generally be considered eligible for the things listed in the Facebook post ""as far as the federal government is concerned, but they may be eligible at a state-level,"" Lim said.   Immigrants who emigrated to the U.S. legally are also generally ineligible for assistance until they’ve been a legal resident for at least five years.   A Facebook post claimed American taxpayer dollars provide ""free housing, free medical, free state identification, free college, free daycare, free Social Security, free EBT cards, free month (sic) checks"" to immigrants in the country illegally.  In some instances, adults may benefit from assistance granted to their U.S.-born children who meet citizenship requirements. Also, states can set eligibility rules requirements for some programs, which may allow immigrants in the country illegally to apply for that assistance. However, the post makes a sweeping generalization, and immigrants illegally in the country are typically not eligible to receive federal public benefits. The post also gives the impression that only U.S. citizens and others here legally pay taxes. It ignores that some immigrants living in the country illegally also pay taxes.

Jackson's office did not respond to our calls and emails for Jackson's source. So we went ahead and took a look at the two aspects of his claim: unauthorized immigrants' access to the ballot and their access to health care. Is it true immigrants living in the U.S. illegally have ""more freedoms"" and easier access to health care and the ballot box compared to most Americans? Immigrants lacking legal authorization to live in the U.S. cannot vote in federal and state elections, said Matthew Weil, director of the Washington-based Bipartisan Policy Center's Elections Project. The project explores and analyzes voter legislation to ultimately inform policy makers. Almost all localities in the U.S., and all in Texas, limit elections to citizens. Even in the small handful of localities where non-citizens can vote in local elections, those localities only allow lawfully present noncitizens to vote. Weil noted New York City is one example of the few localities that allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. New York City allows Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals holders but not all unauthorized immigrants to vote, as reported by the Associated Press in early January. There are no circumstances where noncitizens can vote in federal elections. ""I don't know of any jurisdiction that allows somebody who's here undocumented to access the ballot box,"" Weil said. There are an estimated 1.7 million people lacking legal immigration status in Texas, according to 2019 estimates by the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan policy research institution. More than 20% of them, according to the institute, have been in the U.S. for 20 or more years. Unauthorized immigrants are barred from federal health care programs, said Anne Dunkelberg, associate director at Every Texan, an Austin-based nonpartisan policy institute. This includes Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Based on policy research, Every Texan advocates for Texas to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which all but 12 states have done. That expansion would not include immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. Dunkelberg said there is an exception where providers can recoup the cost of treating an unauthorized immigrant in an emergency situation. Even that emergency funding for providers is subject to the same restrictions as for Medicaid in Texas for adult citizens. ""And so hospital emergency rooms can't turn away people with real emergencies, regardless of whether they're uninsured, regardless of what their immigration status is. They have to treat you in real emergencies,"" Dunkelberg said. ""So that's why there is a provision back for emergency room visits by a very limited number of undocumented immigrants, not even all of them."" Unauthorized immigrants have access to some state and local health programs, which can be funded by federal grants. This patchwork of programs addresses some aspects of wellbeing like mental health, immunizations, and communicable disease. However, these programs are not health care coverage, Dunkelberg said. That care isn't free, and in many cases program costs work on a sliding scale. Those programs are available to citizens, too. Locally, counties can opt to serve uninsured immigrants living in the U.S. illegally through medical assistance programs. The uninsured people seeking care have to meet specific income requirements. Dunkelberg said most of Texas' major urban counties opt to provide care to uninsured unauthorized immigrants. States also have the option of providing prenatal care to women regardless of immigration status through the Children's Health Insurance Program, said Ruth Wasem, professor of public policy practice at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas. Wasem said this option was created under former president George W. Bush. Texas is one such state that opts for the CHIP perinatal program (prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care) for unauthorized immigrants.   Even with limited emergency Medicaid, it's a stretch to say unauthorized immigrants have ""easier access"" compared to most Americans. ""There is no aspect of that that is in any way superior to the access for U.S. citizens,"" Dunkelberg said. Though Jackson led the White House Medical Unit as Physician to the President in the Obama and Trump administrations, he seems off the mark about health care. Rep. Ronny Jackson tweeted ""In 2022, illegal immigrants will have MORE FREEDOMS and easier access to healthcare and ballot boxes than most Americans... Just think about that."" Unauthorized immigrants don't have access to the ballot for federal, state, and almost all local elections. Though immigrants can have access to some medical assistance programs depending on where they live, they also do not qualify for any health insurance coverage with any federal dollars. They do not qualify for Affordable Care Act marketplace coverage even if they pay costs without ACA subsidy. We rate this claim as Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097591DC0>],/factchecks/2022/jan/31/ronny-jackson/ronny-jackson-wrong-unauthorized-immigrant-access-/

Social media claim misleads on risk of myocarditis
","A social media post that says heart inflammation in young people in the U.S. skyrocketed in 2021 is missing context and misleading. The claim is written in marker on a T-shirt pictured in a Jan. 22 post on Facebook. The shirt says in the U.S., myocarditis cases among those ages 12 to 20 numbered four in 2019; four in 2020; and 2,236 in 2021. ""I cannot tell my kids I did nothing!"" is written on top of the numbers. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The numbers in the Facebook post appear to be loosely based on data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, the federal database that has become a breeding ground for misinformation. The VAERS data does reflect an increased number of reports of myocarditis among young people after COVID-19 vaccination — and the post’s estimate of annual myocarditis report numbers is not far off the mark. In 2019, there were 16 reports after all types of vaccination; in 2020 there were nine reports; and in 2021, there were 2,301, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson.   But the raw report numbers do not tell the entire story. For starters, VAERS is an open system where anyone can submit a report, and the reports are not verified. ""VAERS does not determine if the vaccine caused the adverse reaction,"" the CDC spokesperson said. ""Increased awareness of VAERS and mandatory reporting of adverse reactions by healthcare providers has contributed to the huge number of reports VAERS is receiving after COVID vaccination."" But even knowing that the data comes from VAERS, the claim still misses this important context: The risk of myocarditis from COVID-19 vaccines is small and symptoms are normally mild. And contracting COVID-19 is ""a strong and significant risk factor for myocarditis,"" especially among children under 16 years old, according to the CDC. Professional medical groups and federal public health agencies have said the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks. There is a small but increased risk for myocarditis after receiving COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna, which use mRNA technology, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The risk is highest after the second dose in adolescent males and young men. The CDC told Reuters that of the myocarditis or pericarditis VAERS reports it received through Nov. 11, 2021, 1,969 reports concerned people aged 30 and younger who received COVID-19 vaccines. That is only where the process of determining a link begins, not where it ends. ""The CDC and FDA investigated the reports and, through interviews with medical providers and medical record reviews, confirmed 1,005 cases met the criteria for myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis,"" according to Reuters. The CDC also has said that for males ages 12 through 17, for every 1 million COVID-19 vaccine doses administered through June 11, 2021, there were between 56 and 69 reports of myocarditis. ""The facts are clear: this is an extremely rare side effect, and only an exceedingly small number of people will experience it after vaccination,"" according to a June 23 statement co-signed by more than a dozen major medical professional associations, the CDC and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The statement continues, ""Most cases are mild, and individuals recover often on their own or with minimal treatment. In addition, we know that myocarditis and pericarditis are much more common if you get COVID-19, and the risks to the heart from COVID-19 infection can be more severe."" For children under 16, the risk of myocarditis is 37 times higher for those who contract COVID-19 compared with those who do not have the virus, according to a CDC study. That’s in keeping with what experts know: that viral infection is the most common cause of myocarditis in children. A Facebook post says in the U.S., myocarditis cases among ages 12 to 20 numbered four in 2019; four in 2020; and 2,236 in 2021. The post’s numbers are not far off: In 2019, there were 16 reports after all types of vaccinations; in 2020 there were nine reports; and in 2021, there were 2,301. Of the reports among people under 30 who had received COVID-19 vaccines, 1,005 met the criteria for myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis. The VAERS data does reflect an increase in reports of myocarditis among young people, and there is a small but increased risk for myocarditis after receiving COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. However, the risk of myocarditis is small, symptoms are normally mild and professional medical groups and federal public health agencies have said the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks. What’s more, myocarditis is more common following a COVID-19 infection.  We rate this claim Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280975B89C0>],/factchecks/2022/jan/31/facebook-posts/social-media-claim-misleads-risk-myocarditis/
