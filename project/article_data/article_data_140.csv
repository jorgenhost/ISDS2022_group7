Lombardi says he donates 80 to 85 percent of his campaign funds
","
Political observers will remember the Aug. 24 Providence mayoral debate for candidate Chris Young's marriage proposal, which made national news. But amid the YouTube clips and pundit chatter that dominated the aftermath, an otherwise substantive debate was overshadowed.
 
There’s a lot we could have checked from that debate (was the proposal legit, or was it a political ploy?). We'll start, however, by focusing on the one candidate who specifically challenged voters to check his record.

Drawing on questions from viewers during the web-broadcast segment, WPRI-TV's Tim White, the moderator, asked the candidates whether they’d be willing to give leftover campaign funds to nonprofit organizations. Longtime Providence Councilman John Lombardi’s answer?

""I would challenge anyone to look at my finance reports at the Board of Elections. I would venture to say that 80 to 85 percent of my campaign funds go to donations to various organizations throughout the city of Providence, so the answer would be yes, but that would just be a natural occurrence for me.""
 
We love a good challenge, so we barely hesitated before picking up the phone to ask Lombardi whether he actually did all that math to get to 80 to 85 percent. ""Of course I didn’t run the numbers,"" he told us, half laughing, half annoyed.
 
OK, but you did challenge us to check your filings, right?
 
Lombardi said the comment was said in jest and was meant to be nothing more than ""a tongue-in-cheek remark."" We here at PolitiFact like a good joke as much as the next person; however, when you encourage ""anyone to look at my finance reports,"" it doesn't sound much like one.
 
We decided to take him up on the challenge that he now says wasn't a challenge and checked his campaign filings anyway.

Since Lombardi didn’t specify a time frame for the 80-percent donation rate, we elected to start by looking at his 2010 second-quarter campaign finance report.
 
Lombardi said he gave to ""various organizations,"" rather than ""nonprofits,"" so we gave him a little latitude on whom we counted.

For example, we included his donations to the 15th Ward Democratic Association as well as checks written to fundraisers and schools.

The only exception was when such a donation specified ""advertising,"" as was the case with money he gave to the Rhode Island Catholic Diocese and several other organizations.
 
(It is worth noting that giving away money -- including campaign contributions -- is a standard practice for candidates to reward supporters and attract votes.)

The most cash Lombardi had on hand during the second quarter was $121,393; he gave about $5,400 of that to local organizations. That's about 4.4 percent of the total, nowhere near the 80 percent to 85 percent he suggested.
 
When we asked Lombardi about his second-quarter filings, he said the 80-percent figure was never meant to apply to that period because he is spending so much of his campaign funds on his run for mayor. ""But if you go back last year or so before, you’ll find that,"" he told us. ""…Other than this year, that’s a matter of course for me.""

We understand that rationale. It makes sense that he’s not giving away much of his money during a heated primary, which is why we took him up on this suggestion as well and checked all his filings from 2009.

That was before he was ramping up his mayoral campaign, but after his last City Council race was over. So it seemed like a reasonable time for him to have given more to charity.

He didn't.

In the first quarter he gave about 4.2 percent of his funds to local organizations. That number jumped to 7.4 percent in the second quarter, before dropping to 3.5 percent in the third quarter and 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter. That's a yearly average of 4.35 percent. It doesn't even break double digits.

In a follow-up conversation, Lombardi's campaign treasurer said the candidate meant to phrase the claim as 80 percent to 85 percent of his total spending, not his total cash. In the interest of fairness, we ran those numbers too. In 2009, just under 20 percent of his spending, on average, went to local organizations. Again, the numbers never came close to 80 percent.

Lombardi himself offered another defense, insisting that many of his paid ads ran in church bulletins and should therefore be counted as charitable donations. But regardless of where they appeared, those announcements were still paid advertisements promoting Lombardi. When he filed his campaign reports he listed them as just that.

It's clear that Lombardi gives donations to local organizations. But his statement at the debate that he donates 80 percent to 85 percent is simply wrong.

Lombardi may have been joking, as he maintains, or perhaps he just made an unfortunate exaggeration that in a less politically charged time may have gone unnoticed.

Speaking on camera during the debate, he didn't say he was speaking in jest, nor did he crack a smile or do anything else to suggest he wasn’t serious.

What he did was lead voters to believe he deserved credit for a level of charity that was, at best, greatly exaggerated.

Marco Rubio says Charlie Crist has taken 'six different positions' on health care law
","
The media has written extensively about Gov. Charlie Crist's flip-flops amid his independent bid for U.S. Senate -- including about health care. One of his opponents, Republican Marco Rubio, says Crist has repeatedly changed his tune about the federal health care law that passed earlier this year.

In a statement posted on Rubio's website Aug. 27, 2010, he wrote:

""In light of political opportunist Charlie Crist taking his sixth position on ObamaCare today, U.S. Senate Republican nominee Marco Rubio issued the following statement:

""Charlie Crist has six different positions on ObamaCare because he doesn’t actually care about health care, he only cares about getting himself elected. I’m the only candidate in this race who has opposed ObamaCare and vowed to repeal and replace it with a real reform plan that will lower costs, allow people to keep the coverage they have now and give individuals the same tax breaks businesses get to provide health care insurance. We all know Kendrick Meek is a liberal who strongly supports ObamaCare. But Charlie Crist’s political opportunism puts him in a league of his own. After changing his mind six times, I’m still not sure what he believes because he will likely change it again tomorrow.""

In this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to explore whether Crist has taken ""six different positions"" on the health care law. We've certainly heard of politicians -- including Crist -- flip-flopping about the health care bill, but is it possible to have six different positions? We're defining a ""position"" as a statement in support or opposition of something.

First we contacted Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos and he sent us Rubio's six points. He added a seventh item. Let's look at each of them.

Position #1

Crist called for repeal on March 21, 2010, as the U.S. House was voting on the bill, according to a March 21 Associated Press article.

The AP wrote that the main reasons Crist opposed the law was that he said it raises taxes, raises premiums and significantly cuts Medicare.

""Crist, a Republican who was in Tampa tonight attending the closing ceremony for the Gasparilla International Film Festival, said he hopes to get elected senator in November to help repeal the bill and bring a commonsense approach to healthcare reform. 'What people really want when it comes to health care, in my view, is they want greater access and less cost,' Crist said.""

We'll summarize as we go. So, Position #1, Crist was clearly against the bill and calling for repeal.

Position #2

In a July 20 article, Crist told the Wall Street Journal that he was against repealing the law -- but only one sentence of the article summarizes his views on the health care bill: ""Despite pledging as a Republican to help repeal President Obama's health-care overhaul, Mr. Crist now says he does not support such a move."" Keep reading, because this is tied to Position #3.

Position #3

In a more detailed exchange in the Wall Street Journal's Washington Wire blog the same day by the same reporter, Crist said the bill should be ""modified"" but does not call for repeal.

    Q: How do you feel about the health care overhaul?
    A: I think it needs to be improved. I’m concerned about so much government control for it. But there are, (at)  the same time, there are good aspects to it.
    Q: Should it be repealed?
    A: I think it should be modified. It can be made better.
    Q: When the bill passed, you called for its repeal.
    A: Well, I wanted it to be changed….. People get caught up in, 'I’m going to say it’s going to be repealed' like they’re hammering their fist on the desk and be impressed with themselves. That’s part of the purity test.
    Q: Is that an example of something you had to do in the primary campaign as a Republican?
    A: Perhaps. And I just don’t have to do that anymore. I’m liberated to a greater degree, and I’m very happy about it.

Position #2 and Position #3 here are essentially the same -- they were written by the same reporter on the same day -- one is a story that summarizes his view while the blog is a more detailed Q and A. So Position #2 and Position #3, basically, is to modify the law.

Position #4

On July 29, Crist responded to his critics with a press release about his position on the health care bill:

""FACT CHECK: Recent reports in the media have confused my position on the Obama health care bill. The Obama health care bill was too big, too expensive, and expanded the role of government far too much. Had I been in the United States Senate at the time, I would have voted against the bill because of unacceptable provisions like the cuts to the Medicare Advantage program. But being an independent, I have the freedom to be an honest broker for the people of Florida without regard for political party, and the reality is this: despite its serious flaws, the Obama health care bill does have some positive aspects. Repeal must be accompanied by a responsible substitute -- repeal without passage of a substitute law protecting those with pre-existing conditions, closing the prescription drug donut hole for seniors, and allowing parents to keep their children on their insurance coverage until age 26 would be wrong. While I would not have supported the legislation, we have to recognize the positive components and work together across party lines to make our health care system more affordable for both consumers and the government. This debate must not be about political posturing; it must be about protecting the people of Florida and America, and I intend to do that hard work when I get to the United States Senate.""

In this statement, we find a fair measure of political double-speak. In summary, though, Crist is saying he would have voted against the bill and now wants to modify the law. He's offering more elaboration on why and how, but the position to modify is still the same as #2 and #3.

Now hang on, next is where Crist really got into trouble for flip-flopping:

Position #5

At noon on Aug. 27 on Central Florida News 13 Crist was asked how he would have voted on the health care bill. His answer:

""I would have voted for it but I think it can be done better .... there is a part of it as it concerns me as it relates to Medicare.. I think we should have fixed that. It takes about $500 million out of Medicare, that's awfully important to our fellow Floridians and so before voting for it that would have had to have been fixed...""

Position #5: Here, he's clearly saying he would have voted for the bill. But don't blink!

Position #6

Just two hours later at 2 p.m., Crist's campaign sent out this statement:

""If I misspoke, I want to be abundantly clear: the health care bill was too big, too expensive, and expanded the role of government far too much. Had I been in the United States Senate at the time, I would have voted against the bill because of unacceptable provisions like the cuts to the Medicare Advantage program. But being an independent, I have the freedom to be an honest broker for the people of Florida without regard for political party, and the reality is this: despite its serious flaws, the health care bill does have some positive aspects.

""Repeal must be accompanied by a responsible substitute -- repeal without passage of a substitute law protecting those with pre-existing conditions, closing the prescription drug donut hole for seniors, and allowing parents to keep their children on their insurance coverage until age 26 would be wrong. While I would not have supported the legislation, we have to recognize the positive components and work together across party lines to make our health care system more affordable for both consumers and the government.

So finally, Position #6: He said he would have voted against it and he's back to modifying the bill.

Additional perspective

About that seventh item we mentioned earlier, it's an Aug. 29 interview with Ed Henry of CNN, and here is the CNN transcript. Crist said he supported parts of the bill and parts he takes issue with, that ""what we need to do is fix it and we need to go forward."" He's still sticking to modifying the bill.

We asked Crist campaign spokesman Danny Kanner for a response to Rubio's claim that Crist stated six different positions.

He referred us to a July 29 article on factcheck.org. Keep in mind that article was before the Aug. 27 TV flip-flop. The article dissects a July 22 Rubio ad which states ""Charlie Crist now says he supports Obamacare."" Factcheck concluded that Crist's position had shifted but that it was not ""a complete reversal.""

Kanner also sent us a copy of Crist's statement following the noon Aug. 27 interview, which we quoted above.

Summary

We summarized as we went, but let's tabulate it one more time with dates.

* March 21: Crist said he's against the bill and favors repeal.
* July 20: Crist said he doesn't support repealing the bill and wants to modify it.
* July 29: Crist again said he would have voted against the bill and wants to modify it.
* Aug. 27, noon: Crist said he would have voted for the bill.
* Aug. 27, 2 p.m.: Crist said he would have voted against the bill.

Our ruling

So we see three main positions here: Crist has said he was against the bill and wanted it repealed, Crist has said he would have voted for it, and Crist has said he wants to modify the bill.

Where does that leave us?

Rubio says Crist has had ""six different positions"" on the health care bill. We agree he has made conflicting statements about his views on the health care bill -- once it only took him two hours to contradict himself. But generally his positions can be summarized in three ways: he was opposed and wanted to repeal the law, he said he would have voted for the law, and he wants to modify the law. We think ""six different positions"" is the wrong number, but ""different positions"" is right on.

Bennet says Ken Buck wants to privatize Social Security
","
Demonizing privatization was a key to the Democrat's success in defeating President George W. Bush's plan to change Social Security. Now they're using it again in an attempt to hold on to legislative majorities in the House and the Senate. In his latest TV ad, Senate candidate Michael Bennet, D-Col., questions whether his opponent, Ken Buck, is the right person for the job.

The ad opens with a video of Buck saying he'll be the ""voice of people on Main Street"" but quickly transitions to ominous music and a narrator asking ""Who is Ken Buck"" and ""Does he speak for Colorado?"" The narrator goes on make a series of charges, including that ""Buck wants to privatize Social Security.""

History has shown that accusing your opponent of wanting to privatize Social Security is a good political strategy. President Obama has certainly taken notice. During the 2008 campaign, then candidate Obama accused Sen. John McCain of wanting to revitalize Bush's plan to ""privatize"" Social Security. We rated that Barely True. And during his weekly address in August, Obama said that some Republican leaders in Congress"" are ""pushing to make privatizing Social Security a key part of their legislative agenda if they win a majority in Congress this fall."" We rated it Barely True once again.

So how does the evidence stack up in this case?

In March of 2010, while speaking at the Constitutionalist Today forum, Buck was asked whether it is ""constitutional for the government to have a Social Security program where it directs the monies that we put into it?"" Here is his response, in its entirety:

""I don't know whether it's constitutional or not. It is certainly a horrible policy in what happened in the LBJ Administration back in the 60's when they took the money out of the trust fund to fund general fund programs, and what we ended up with was a system that will be bankrupt anywhere from 10 to 25 years from now. It is a bad policy. I don't know that the federal government should be involved in a retirement plan. It should be a plan that certainly once people pay into it, they have the expectation of getting a return, and they're entitled to that, but the idea the federal government should be running health care or retirement or any of those programs is fundamentally against what I believe and that is that the private sector runs programs like that far better.""

So Buck is clearly critical of Social Security in its current form, and he did say that the ""private sector runs programs like that (Social Security) far better,"" but is he actually for privatizing the program? Here is what Owen Loftus, Ken Buck's press secretary, told Denver's 9News on Aug. 31, 2010:

""Ken is not in favor of privatizing Social Security. Here is Ken's position -- For current beneficiaries; the government has made a sacred promise. Current retirees have planned their lives based on these Social Security benefits. For older workers approaching retirement, they have already planned their retirement. We need to ensure that Social Security is solvent for these workers. All ideas should be on the table to ensure this. These can include some sort of means testing, or raising the retirement age to reflect the fact that people live longer than they used to. For younger workers and future generations, the issue isn't Social Security; it's savings. We must ensure that Social Security is there for younger workers when they retire, and that retains its main function as a safety net for retirees. To do this, the government needs to craft policies to encourage younger workers to save more.""

During a July 22, 2010 debate sponsored by Denver's 9News, Buck said, ""We've got to peg Social Security to individuals so those individuals have the ability perhaps to invest in various funds that are approved by the government. But those individuals also own that fund.""

Then there is an interview with CNN's John King on Aug. 11, 2010. Asked whether he thinks the government should be involved in retirement policy, Buck responded that he does not think ""it's what the Founding Fathers intended, but we have the policy. We've made a promise to our seniors. We need to keep that promise. I think we need to make sure that we are putting Social Security on a sustainable path. It's absolutely something that the federal government is going to be involved in, in the future. We can make it the best program we can make it.""

Trevor Kincaid, communications director for Michael Bennet, maintains, however, that Buck has shown hostility toward the Social Security program. ""Context again is important here, and in the context of an entire answer in which he explicitly questions whether Social Security should exist at all, Buck's hostility towards the program (at least in its current form) is clear. And calling the program in its current form a horrible policy is calling the program as it exists a horrible policy,"" he told 9News.

Going back to the original claim, Michael Bennet said that Buck wants to privatize Social Security, using a term that we believe is often used to scare seniors into thinking that their lifetime savings will be transferred into the stock market -- the same one that took a plunge in 2008 and is still struggling. He said that he does not think that the Founding Fathers intended to have the program, and he openly stated that the private sector would do a better job of allowing younger workers to save. But he also has been very clear that he does not want to change the program for current retirees or those close to retiring. Bennet's ad gives the impression that Buck wants to expose all seniors' benefits to the vicissitudes of the stock market, but we find that's not the case. As a result, we rate this Half True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/02/michael-bennet/bennet-says-ken-buck-wants-privatize-social-securi/

Sen. Lincoln says Boozman wants to privatize Social Security.
","
Democrats used it to defeat President Bush's plans to change Social Security, and they're using it now to try to  hold on to legislative majorities in the House and the Senate. We are, of course, talking about ""privatization."" In her latest TV ad, Senate incumbent Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., says that there are ""serious differences"" between her and her opponent, Rep. John Boozman. First on the list, ""unlike John, I am against privatizing Social Security and Medicare.""

History has shown that accusing your opponent of wanting to privatize Social Security is a good political strategy. President Barack Obama has certainly taken notice. During the 2008 campaign, then candidate Obama accused Sen. John McCain of wanting to revitalize Bush's plan to ""privatize"" Social Security. We rated that Barely True. And during his weekly address in August, Obama said that some Republican leaders in Congress"" are ""pushing to make privatizing Social Security a key part of their legislative agenda if they win a majority in Congress this fall."" We rated it Barely True once again.

So how does the evidence stack up in this case?

When Boozman ran for Congress in 2001, he said that he supported President Bush's proposal to allow individuals under 55 to divert a portion of their payroll taxes into a personal investment account. ""The future of Social Security is dependent on creating a vehicle for private investment,"" Boozman said. And again in 2004, ""Boozman said he likes the idea of transferring a small percentage of the federal (Social Security) trust fund to 'very safe' investments,"" reported the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

Lincoln also pointed to Boozman's statement on the ""Roadmap for America’s Future,"" a bill from Rep. Paul Ryan, the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee. The plan includes a proposal to allow people under 55 to steer a portion of their payroll taxes toward personal accounts, through which they can invest in funds chosen and managed by a federal government board. Asked by the Arkansas Times whether he supports the proposal, Boozman said that he ""appreciates"" Ryan's ""commitment to putting our country on the road to fiscal responsibility."" He added that the plan is not perfect, ""but I think he is making a thoughtful and serious effort to prevent Congress from driving our country into financial ruin."" 
But even if Boozman had said that he fully supports Ryan's proposal, whether one can rightly call that or the Bush plan ""privatization"" of Social Security is debatable. Consider that in both cases, current retirees or those near the retirement age would not have been directly affected -- the plans are completely voluntary and only for workers under 55. One could choose to stay in the traditional government-run system and receive benefits as promised. That's important, because the term ""privatization"" is often used to scare seniors into thinking that their lifetime savings will be transferred into the stock market -- the same one that took a plunge in 2008 and is still recovering.

Ryan told PolitiFact in an e-mail that it would be incorrect to call even the personal retirement account portion ""privatized."" 
""In the personal-accounts system, the accounts are owned by the individual, and managed and overseen by Social Security -- not a stockbroker or private investment firm,"" Ryan stated. ""People choosing the reformed system select from a handful of government-regulated options -- just as Members of Congress and federal employees do."" 
Even Lincoln's own website says that Ryan's plan would only ""partially privatize"" Social Security, though not everyone agrees. An analysis of Ryan's ""Roadmap"" plan from the left-leaning Center of Budget and Policy Priorities, argues that, ""what makes these accounts private is their ownership, not their oversight or management."" 
We contacted Boozman's office to get a clarification on his proposal to transfer a small percentage of the trust fund to ""very safe investments."" His communications director, Patrick Creamer, sent us the following statement:

""Congressman Boozman’s number one priority is making sure no benefits are cut to current and future enrollees. However, he understands the current system is unsustainable and in need of reform to ensure that future generations also receive benefits. One option he is open to is allowing younger workers to put a portion of their payroll taxes into safe investments –- but this is a decision individuals would have to make, not the government, and any proposal must have the support of the people of Arkansas to get his vote.""

So let's review. Lincoln says that Boozman supports privatizing Social Security. It is true that Rep. Boozman stated on more than one occasion that he supports allowing -- not requiring -- younger workers to divert a portion of their payroll taxes into private investment accounts. But even Lincoln's website admits that such a proposal only constitutes ""partial privatization."" In 2004, Boozman said that he would support transferring a portion of the trust fund into private investments. We are not entirely sure what that would have entailed, but when we asked him whether he supports the government putting money into the stock market, he told us that that decision lies solely with the individual workers. In short, Lincoln's ad makes it seem as though Boozman has consistently advocated handing the entire program over to Wall Street bankers, which is a significant stretch.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz says Daniel Webster supports privatization, cuts to Social Security
","
Most politicians know how to pivot: In a political context, it means changing the subject you don't like to one that you do. House member Debbie Wasserman Schultz demonstrated the maneuver in an interview with Larry King on CNN, changing the subject from a new mosque in New York City all the way to Florida Republican candidate for Congress Dan Webster and privatizing Social Security.

Here's how the exchange went, with conservative commentator Ben Stein jumping in for good measure:

King: ""Congresswoman Schultz, do you think that Muslim situation in New York will be a national issue?""

Schultz: ""I really don't think it will be a national issue. I think what it boils down to is, it is a case of just because you can doesn't mean you should. I think the leadership of the mosque and that Muslim community in that area of New York City would be well served to sit down with the leadership in New York and in that community, and work together to build some consensus on an alternative site. I do think the national issues that are important in the outcome of races are turning the economy around, creating jobs, and the fact that virtually all Republican candidates for Congress across the country support privatization of Social Security, deep cuts in Social Security, like Dan Webster in Florida ...""

Stein: ""She just made that up."" 
Schultz: ""No, no, Ben. With all due respect to you, I did nothing of the kind. There are candidates across the country for Congress ..."" 
Stein: ""Will you show us the source?"" 
King (demonstrating his own pivot and going to viewer phone calls): ""Phoenix, hello."" 
We wanted to check the Florida Democrat's claim that ""virtually all Republican candidates for Congress across the country support privatization of Social Security."" But we found many Republican candidates aren't on the record one way or the other about privatizing Social Security. We find her broad statement dubious after looking into President Obama's statement, ""Some Republican leaders in Congress"" are ""pushing to make privatizing Social Security a key part of their legislative agenda if they win a majority in Congress this fall."" We rated that Barely True.

But we decided to look at her specific example, that Republican candidate for Congress Dan Webster supports ""privatization of Social Security, deep cuts in Social Security.""

Webster is running against Alan Grayson, the outspoken Democrat who represents the Orlando area. (During the debate over the health care law, Grayson won notoriety for saying the Republican health plan was ""die quickly."") Wasserman Schultz is a supporter of Grayson's and a deputy whip for the Democrats in Congress, so it's not surprising she would comment on the race. Webster is a former Speaker of the House in the Florida state legislature and has been endorsed by Jeb Bush, the former Republican governor. 
A spokesman for Wasserman Schultz pointed us to a report in the liberal Huffington Post website about remarks Webster made at a candidates' forum sponsored by the tea party movement. Webster said the nation's budget woes could be addressed by rolling back the current budget to 2007 levels. The statement didn't provide any evidence backing Wasserman Schultz's claim that Webster supports privatization, but it does mention cutting cost-of-living increases for entitlement programs, which include Social Security and Medicare. 
""Just three years ago, if we would take that budget and pass it today just as it was, does it roll back some salary increases? Yes,"" Webster said. ""Does it get rid of TARP and health care and all of the other things, including the stimulus package? Yes, it does that. Does it take back some of the COLAs for the entitlement programs? Yes, it does that, too. But it's only three years ago. If we took that budget and passed it, it would self-balance in two more years."" (The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has posted the video on YouTube.)

The definition of an entitlement program is any kind of program that spells out the benefits for people under the law. Social Security and Medicare are the largest federal entitlement programs. It's certainly reasonable to think he meant those programs, since he referred to entitlement programs. Rolling back COLAs -- cost of living adjustments -- would reduce Social Security payments for current retirees.

But the Webster campaign released a statement after the Orlando Sentinel reported on the forum, saying that Webster did not support rolling back cost-of-living increases to Social Security. The Webster campaign sent us the same statement from the candidate when we asked about the issue. The Sentinel reported on the statement on Aug. 18, four days after Webster's statement on Aug. 12 and a week before Wasserman Schultz's Aug. 24, 2010 appearance on CNN.

""I've never stated that Social Security benefits should be cut or reduced for those who are currently receiving benefits or those near retirement age,"" the statement said. ""Social Security is a mandatory program that is not included in the budgetary process. I simply stated that the budget should be rolled back to 2007 levels to help address our national budget crisis. Rolling back the budget to 2007 will eliminate what is left of the bailouts, stimulus packages, salary increases (COLA) for federal employees - which includes Congressmen, and Obama's Healthcare Plan.""

So Webster said he does not support rolling back the recent increases for current Social Security recipients, even though his comments at the forum gave the opposite impression. In his first statement he said that he wanted to take back ""some of the COLAs for the entitlement programs,"" which could include Social Security. More recently, he said ""I never stated that Social Security benefits should be cut or reduced"" but that he supports rolling back ""salary increases (COLA) for federal employees.""

Our next question for Webster's campaign was whether Webster supported a plan promoted by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., a plan to add personal accounts to Social Security, which some consider privatizing. Under the Ryan plan, those 55 and older would not be affected one way or another; they would simply receive benefits as they are set up today. Workers under 55 would have the option to stay in the traditional government-run system and receive benefits as promised or to opt for personal retirement accounts in which they could invest part of their payroll taxes. Those personal accounts would be a series of funds managed by the government. It would partially privatize Social Security in the sense that people would own their own accounts.

Webster's campaign didn't respond to our repeated questions about whether Webster supported Ryan's plan or not.

Wasserman Schultz said that Republicans support ""privatization of Social Security, deep cuts in Social Security"" and gave Webster as an example. Webster's comments at the forum didn't address privatization. Webster's comments at the forum gave the impression he supported cuts, but he didn't specifically mention Social Security, and later he specifically said he didn't support cuts to the program. We're not sure whether Webster supports Ryan's plan, which isn't full privatization anyway. We have questions about Webster's position on Social Security, and we hope he will be more forthcoming as the campaign progresses. Still, that doesn't give Wasserman Schultz license to fill in the blanks. We rate her statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/02/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-dan-webster-supports/

""This (election) will be a contest which presents a clear choice between a conservative outsider with business experience and a specific plan to create 700,000 jobs, and another liberal Obamacrat who wants to raise taxes, cut Medicare, and supports Obama's failed stimulus,"" Scott said.

Sink responded to the Medicare line the next morning. ""I don't even know where he got that from,"" Sink said in Tallahassee. ""Of course I don't want to cut Medicare.""

Does Sink want to cut Medicare?

The Scott campaign pointed PolitiFact Florida to President Barack Obama's major health care legislation as evidence to back up their allegation. According to Scott-think, the linkage works like this: Sink supported the federal health care bill, and the health care bill cuts Medicare. Therefore Sink supports Medicare cuts.

On the first part, Sink issued a tepid endorsement of the health care bill on March 22, 2010. ""Though it is certainly not perfect, these long-overdue reforms are better than Washington continuing to do nothing to improve America's health care system,"" Sink said in part. You can read the rest of it here.

The issue, in our minds, really boils down to the health care bill and how it affects Medicare.

Medicare and the 2010 health care bill

Medicare serves as the health insurance program for 39 million seniors and another eight million people under 65 receiving Social Security. Medicare makes up 12 percent of the federal budget.

Naturally, Medicare reforms were part of the 2010 health care legislation.

""Some (reforms) increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage,"" said Tricia Neuman, vice president and director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending to help the program operate more efficiently and help fund coverage expansions to the uninsured in the underlying health reform legislation. Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care.""

Neuman walked through the changes in an easily digestible tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation's website. It's the best non-ideological explanation we've seen.

The 2010 law includes a $250 rebate for prescription drugs purchased through Medicare Part D. Currently, after an initial benefit period, enrollees are required to pay 100 percent of their prescription drug costs until they reach a level of catastrophic coverage. The rebate is meant to begin to close in a hole in prescription drug coverage for beneficiaries. By 2020, Medicare will pay 75 percent of the total cost of generic prescription drug coverage in the gap.

The health reform bill also reduces the growth in Medicare spending by more than $500 billion over 10 years, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates.

Nearly $220 billion in savings comes from reducing annual increases in payments health care providers would otherwise receive from Medicare. Other savings include $36 billion for increases in premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and $12 billion for administrative changes. A new national board will be tasked to identify $15.5 billion in savings, but the board -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits.

And then there's another $136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program. About 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan.

There are two basic ways most people get Medicare coverage. They enroll in traditional Medicare and a prescription drug plan through the government and maybe buy a supplemental policy to cover most out-of-pocket costs. Or they enroll in Medicare Advantage programs (they include drug plans), which are run by private insurers. They typically have more generous benefits such as dental and vision coverage. Some plans even pay the patient’s monthly Medicare premium, which can amount to about $100.

A June 2009 MedPAC analysis said that the Advantage programs costs taxpayers on average of 14 percent more than the traditional Medicare plan. President Obama has said repeatedly that the Medicare Advantage plan wastes public money that could be put to better use.

""We do think that systems like Medicare are very inefficient right now, but it has nothing to do at the moment with issues of benefits,"" Obama said in Aug. 11, 2009, speech in New Hampshire. ""The inefficiencies all come from things like paying $177 billion to insurance companies in subsidies for something called Medicare Advantage that is not competitively bid, so insurance companies basically get $177 billion of taxpayer money to provide services that Medicare already provides. And it's no better -- it doesn't result in better health care for seniors. It is a giveaway of $177 billion.""

The health care law that President Obama signed in March phases out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs and institutes other rules for the program. Generally speaking, the extra payments phase out over the next three to six years. In a few cases, plans will be able to keep current funding if they qualify for special bonuses

""How these payment changes will affect beneficiaries remains to be seen -- but is expected to vary across the country,"" Neuman said. ""The Congressional Budget Office projects the law will result in fewer enrollees in Medicare Advantage plans, and fewer extra benefits for Medicare Advantage enrollees, on average. It is also possible that the number of plans available to beneficiaries will decline -- which may or may not be a concern. On average, Medicare beneficiaries have 30 plans available to them in 2010.""

PolitiFact has waded into this ground before whether the adjustments to the Medicare Advantage option constitute a cut. Most experts we talked to had the same answer: yes and no.

On one hand, they might not be considered cuts because nowhere in the bill are benefits actually eliminated, experts said. And other parts of the bill expand coverage for seniors and ultimately make some components of Medicare less expensive for patients.

Still, changes could be in store for Medicare Advantage participants. The basic benefits that mirror regular Medicare will stay the same, but the extra benefits that people receive under Advantage would likely be reduced, experts said.

""The core benefits of Medicare won't change,"" said Marc Steinberg, deputy director of health policy for Families USA, an advocate for health care consumers. ""Most (Medicare Advantage) plans are solid and resemble traditional Medicare."" However, some insurance plans have entered the program ""to make a quick buck. They may have to reconsider their budget, which could mean some patients will see changes in the services provided above and beyond traditional Medicare.""
 
Stuart Guterman, assistant vice president for the Commonwealth Fund’s program on payment system reform, had a similar view.
 
""People enrolled in (Medicare Advantage) get services that people in traditional care do not get under Medicare,"" he said. ""Insurance companies can afford to cover these services because taxpayer money is subsidizing them. Plans will most likely not offer those extra services, but in no case will (patients) get less Medicare benefits than people in the rest of the program.""

That's a key distinction when analyzing Scott's comments. Any cuts, if you can call them cuts, in the federal health care bill will happen to extra benefits for Medicare Advantage participants, experts say. Not the traditional Medicare program and the traditional Medicare benefits.

Our ruling 
We must note that Medicare is a federal program, not a state one, so Sink wouldn't be able to cut benefits -- even if she wanted to -- if she's elected in November. 
Scott's basis for claiming that Sink supports cuts is that she supported the 2010 federal health care legislation that implemented a number of changes to the Medicare program. There are potential cuts coming to the extra benefits received by Medicare Advantage enrollees. But the law does not alter basic Medicare benefits, and actually increases some prescription drug benefits. 
Because she was not a member of Congress, Sink did not cast a vote for or against the new health law. Additionally, her endorsement was tepid: She said it was better than nothing and ""far from perfect."" On Medicare, she praised the part of the bill that spends more money on prescription drugs for seniors, and didn't say anything about the cuts for Medicare Advantage. In short, we don't think there's a credible case to be made that Sink supported that part of the bill. The distance between Sink and cuts to Medicare is just too great. We rate Scott's statement False.",/factchecks/2010/sep/02/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-alex-sink-wants-cut-medicare/

Rob Portman statement on unemployment illustrates how some Ohioans have hit hard times
","
It’s rough out there, as anyone who’s lost a job can attest. Rob Portman, running for U.S. Senate in Ohio, caught our attention by describing on a radio program just how tough it is.

""Look, we’ve got a situation in Ohio and so many other states right now where people are starting to lose hope,"" the Republican candidate told Roger Hedgecock, a nationally syndicated radio host, on Aug. 18. ""More than half of our unemployed Ohioans have been out of work for six months or more.""

Portman’s solutions -- lower taxes, more spending on highways but less on other government programs, redirected stimulus money -- would be popular among many Republicans and unpopular among many Democrats. But we’re not assessing Portman’s platform here. His figure alone -- ""six months or more"" --  seemed worth checking, because it is stark.

It also is accurate -- by one measure. There’s a different measure, however, that would change the claim..

We started by asking the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, or ODJFS, which is in charge of unemployment compensation in the state. Ben Johnson, a department spokesman, said that a primary statistic used to measure the number of people out of work comes from a monthly survey that merely asks, ""Are you unemployed?""

If the answer is yes, it asks another question: Have you actively looked for work in the prior four weeks?

As of July, 614,000, or 10.3 percent of Ohio’s working-age population, answered yes to both those questions. While high, that’s down from the 656,000 figure reported for March.  

Yet slightly more than half the Ohioans who are unemployed received unemployment compensation. The others are getting severance pay from their former employers, or they work some weeks but not others. Still others might not have applied for compensation, don’t qualify for it because of the way they quit their jobs, were fired for just cause, or have exceeded the number of weeks in which they can collect it.

Portman’s figure comes from that first, smaller universe: the number of Ohioans getting unemployment compensation, not the broader number of people without a job.   

During the week that ended Aug. 21, 309,522 Ohioans received unemployment compensation, according to ODJFS. Of those, 127,873, or 41.3 percent, had received those state unemployment benefits for a half year or less.  Another 150,990 Ohioans, or 48.8 percent of those getting help, had gone on to federal unemployment compensation for as much as an additional 53 weeks. And 30,659 more, or 9.9 percent, were getting up to 20 more weeks under a federal program.

That means that 58.7 percent of Ohioans on unemployment compensation were out of work for more than half a year.

""That’s a factor of the recession,"" said George Zeller, an economic research analyst in Cleveland who watches the employment numbers closely. And while Portman’s statement referred strictly to Ohio, ""it’s true for the whole country,"" Zeller said.

Yet there is another way of measuring unemployment duration. Used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, it classifies people as unemployed if they do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks, and are currently available for work. It is the same survey, in fact, from which ODJFS was able to determine that 614,000 Ohioans were out of work in July.

Remember, not all of those workers got unemployment benefits. And unlike the weekly state benefits reports, which are current, the surveys have a slight time lag. But through this Current Population Survey, conducted every month since 1940, BLS is at least able to determine on an annual basis how long people have been out of work, regardless of whether they are getting benefits.  

In 2009, the last full year, Ohio had 608,000 people who were out of work, and 181,000 of them had been unemployed for 27 weeks or more, according to this data. That means that of all the unemployed Ohioans last year, 29.7 percent had been out of work for six months or more.

So which figure is right? Is it more than half, or 29.7 percent?

Actually, both are accurate measures, according to agencies that keep the numbers and groups that use them. Policy Matters Ohio, a Cleveland-based think tank, cites the 29.7 percent figure in reviewing the economic climate of the past year, but with the caveat that ""we’re looking at different things,"" says Amy Hanauer, the executive director.

Unless there’s a dramatic adjustment in the BLS numbers, it’s looking like the year-round figures for 2010 will be higher, as they already nationally. Last year, 31.5 percent of people without jobs across the nation had been unemployed for 27 weeks or more, according to another BLS measure, not adjusted for seasonal employment. Moving forward, the success of those looking for work for at least half a year has not gotten better; as of July, 43 percent of those without jobs nationally had gone without work for at least 27 weeks. That level of detail was not yet available for Ohio.

Now back to Portman. This is where those paying close attention to politics will bring up a pertinent point: Although Congress provides extra money so people can get unemployment compensation beyond 26 weeks, a majority of Republicans delayed the program’s extension in July. Senate Republicans said that theirs wasn’t a heartless filibuster; they just wanted to find a way to keep the cost of extending benefits from adding to the federal debt.

Portman, though not in office, agreed that Congress should find a way to pay, and his spokeswoman, Jessica Towhey, said Portman supported a provision by Sen. John Thune of South Dakota to tap unobligated economic stimulus funds and cut or freeze several other federal programs. Sen. Scott Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, had a similar proposal that Portman also supported, Towhey said

Democrats said these approaches, and the delay, were callous. ""Although Republicans have no hesitation giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, they continue to pull out all stops in an effort to block unemployed Americans from receiving unemployment benefits, including over 112,000 in Ohio alone,"" Eric Schultz, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in July, criticizing Portman.

But Towhey, the Portman spokeswoman, noted that Democrats later came up with their own ways to pay for other economic programs -- with offsets that included a cut in food stamp funding.

Charges of callousness could go on all day but that is not for us to referee here. To those who decry the polarity of partisan politics, take solace: Both sides agree that too many people have been out of work for too long.

Has it been six months or more? By one measure, it has. That’s why we rate Portman’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/02/rob-portman/rob-portman-statement-unemployment-illustrates-how/
"['National', 'Education', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Randi Weingarten']","
Randi Weingarten says students in strong union states perform better academically
","
Education was the topic du jour on ABC's This Week on Aug. 29, 2010, and the discussion quickly came around to teachers unions. 
This Week host Christiane Amanpour asked Randi Weingarten, president of the American Teachers Federation, how schools can get around huge impediments in many collective bargaining agreements to getting rid of bad teachers. 
Weingarten responded with a quick defense of teachers unions. 
""Let me say this,"" Weingarten said. ""First, the states that actually have lots of teachers in teacher unions tend to be the states that have done the best in terms of academic success in this country. And the states that don't tend to be the worst. 
""The issue is not a teacher union contract or a teacher union-management contract. What we have to do with these contracts is we have to make them solution-driven."" 
We decided to check Weingarten's claim that states that ""have lots of teachers in teachers unions tend to be the states that have done the best in terms of academic success."" 
We realize we are wading into some treacherous waters here. An intense debate has raged for years over the effect of teacher unions on student achievement. On one side, you have those who believe unions act as an impediment to necessary school reforms; make it difficult to get rid of bad teachers, and oppose ideas like merit pay to encourage better teaching. On the other side are those who argue strong unions lead to better-paid, better-supported teachers, which helps to attract and retain better teachers and, in turn, contributes to improved student achievement. 
Weingarten's statement not only makes an absolute claim about better academic performance in states with strong unions, it implies unions are the reason why -- otherwise, why cite it? 
We contacted the American Federation of Teachers, which represents about 1.4 million K-12 teachers in the United States, to get backup for Weingarten's claim. Initially, spokesman John See pointed us toward a state-by-state breakdown on collective bargaining policies -- such as whether the state has a ""right to work"" law or allows strikes. And he included links to comparisons of academic achievement by state from the National Center for Education Statistics and Education Week. Strong union states like Maryland, Massachusetts and New York, See said, were among the highest ranked in these 2010 reports. 
Later, See also forwarded links to several studies linking teacher unions to higher student achievement. 
The first is a study published in 2000 in the Harvard Educational Review. According to the abstract: ""Comparison of standardized test scores and degree of teacher unionization in states found a statistically significant and positive relationship between the presence of teacher unions and stronger state performance on tests. Taking into account the percentage of students taking the tests, states with greater percentages of teachers in unions reported higher test performance."" 
The second is a 2002 survey of studies by Robert M. Carini of Indiana University Bloomington, who found that ""While only 17 prominent studies have looked at the teacher union-achievement link, the evidence suggests that unionism raises achievement modestly for most students in public schools."" However, Carini wrote that while studies seem to suggest that unions benefit middle range students, who are the majority, ""a union presence was harmful for the very lowest- and highest-achieving students."" 
""In fact, public opinion is split as to whether teacher unionism is harmful or helpful to educational outcomes,"" Carini wrote. ""Considering both this general perception and the considerable rhetoric from both critics and supporters of unions, it is surprising that so little research exists on the unionism-achievement link. Still, the overall pattern in the research is increasingly clear; teacher unionism favorably influences achievement for most students in public schools."" 
In an e-mail, See said the reports ""make the positive findings pretty clear."" 
If there were only one way to measure this statistic, See might be right. But, in fact, there are lots of variables in play. 
A 2008 paper written by Nathan Burroughs, a visiting research associate at the Center for Evaluation and Education Policy, cited numerous studies that seemed to make the case both for and against unions with regard to student achievement. 
""Ideally, the proper role of collective bargaining in public education could be settled by a consensus in the research literature,"" Burroughs wrote in his paper, Arguments and Evidence: The Debate over Collective Bargaining's Role in Public Education. ""Regrettably, no such consensus exists."" 
""While a body of research exists suggesting that collective bargaining results in greater student achievement (usually measured through standardized test scores, most commonly the SAT), another body of work suggests the opposite,"" Burroughs wrote. ""To complicate matters, both veins of research generally employ different analytical and statistical methods, making a clear-cut comparison somewhat elusive. In addition, there is a limited number of quality research studies dedicated to the effects of collective bargaining on student achievement."" 
What gives? For one, the studies that showed a positive effect from unions typically examined student achievement at a single point in time; while studies that showed lower student achievement in states with stronger unions usually measured achievement over time. We spoke to Burroughs, who explained that while a snapshot might show better scores in an affluent state compared to a poor one; students in an affluent state might improve less dramatically over time than a poor one, producing dramatically different results. It's simply two different ways to measure a school's performance. 
""The intensity of the debate over the role of collective bargaining has obscured the fact that empirical evidence supports either side of the discussion,"" Burroughs concluded. ""There can be no verdict on whether collective bargaining in public education is 'bad' or 'good,' because there is insufficient evidence to warrant a definitive judgment. Much of the research on the effects of collective bargaining focuses on only one or two elements of the question or has results that appear dependent on a particular methodological strategy."" 
In addition, Burroughs cautioned that collective bargaining is most likely an indirect causal factor when it comes to student achievement; as opposed to direct factors such as income or parental education. 
""It could be a spurious relationship,"" Burroughs told us. ""The data really isn't there. When it comes to making claims about unions and student performance, it's just not clear. I think it's more constructive to focus on other things."" 
We also spoke to Andy Rotherham, co-founder of the non-profit Bellwether Education Partners, an education columnist for TIME.com and the blog Eduwonk.com, and co-editor of the book ""Collective Bargaining in Education."" 
""On its face, it's true,"" Rotherham said of Weingarten's claim. ""Massachusetts (a strong union state) does better than Virginia or Alabama. What it ignores is all of the things that influence student achievement."" 
""It's a classic correlation-causation fallacy,"" said Rotherham, who previously served at the White House as Special Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy during the Clinton administration. 
Ultimately, he said, research is mixed and there is no study that can definitively settle whether unions are, or are not, the problem with student achievement. 
""Sweeping statements one way or the other on this should be viewed with suspicion,"" Rotherham said. 
We agree. Weingarten's claim that states that have lots of teachers in teacher unions tend to be the states that have done the best in terms of academic success is perhaps technically correct -- at least by some measures. But the empirical scientific research on this subject is -- in the words of Burroughs -- ""limited, ambiguous and incomplete."" Further, there is even less evidence to support the implication that strong unionization is the cause for one state performing better than another. And so we rate Weingarten's claim Half True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/02/randi-weingarten/randi-weingarten-says-students-strong-union-states/

Harry Reid says Sharron Angle wants to eliminate the Education Department
","
The Nevada Senate race between incumbent Democrat Harry Reid and Republican challenger Sharron Angle has become one of the nation's most bitter, with Angle seeking to make Reid the poster child for the poor national and Nevada economies and Reid trying to portray Angle's staunchly conservative views as out of the mainstream.

In a television ad released Aug. 23, 2010, Reid's campaign says that Angle wants to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education. The ad relies on a clip from an interview Angle did with radio station KNPR, the NPR affiliate in Nevada, on May 19, 2010, when she was running in the GOP primary.

The exchange quoted in the ad begins with the host asking Angle, ""Would you eliminate the Department of Education or simply cut it back?"" Angle replies, ""I would like to go through to the elimination.""

We wanted to look through the rest of the interview to make sure that Angle really does believe that the department should be eliminated.

First, a little background on the Education Department. Its budget for fiscal year 2010 is about $64 billion. Of this, nearly $27 billion consists of Pell Grants, which fund disadvantaged students in college and graduate school. Another $25 billion is authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, including funding to K-12 school systems around the country. An additional $12 billion comes from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which helps fund education for disabled K-12 students. Much of the remainder is spent on educational research.

We went to the archived interview and found that the ad doesn't distort her view. Here's a transcript of the relevant portion of the interview:

""I believe that anything that isn't a federally governed, enumerated power in the Constitution, which means the federal government should be paying out on this, is up for grabs here,"" she said. ""And we have some departments like the Department of Education that passes down policy, one-size-fits-all, that fits no one. Like No Child Left Behind. We need to keep those education dollars right here in the state and put them where they will do the most good, which is right in that clasroom, with that classroom teacher. We need to cut down on those bureaucracies that take those educational dollars that should be going into that classroom.

""And it angers me every time I hear (politicians) say we're going to cut teachers,"" she continued. ""What about the agencies that never see a child, never have been in a classroom, that are passing down policy that actually overburdens our classrooms. What about those? Why don't we cut there?""

That's when the host interjects. ""Would you eliminate the Department of Education or simply cut it back?""

Angle responds, ""I would like to go through to the elimination. I think we start by defunding it, and the reason that we should eliminate it is because its not the federal government's job to provide education for our children. It's a 10th Amendment right. It should be done here in the state, and it should be done as close to the local as possible.""

Reviewing the exchange on KNPR, it seems to us that the ad portrayed Angle's stance accurately. She did not hesitate, backtrack or give any indication that she misspoke, even when the host gave her the opportunity to roll back the scope of her proposal.

She's expressed that position before, in a Mar. 22, 2010, interview with the conservative website Nevada News & Views, when she said she would like to eliminate not just the Education Department but the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency as well. 
It's worth noting that there's been a long-running constitutional debate about whether the Education Department is legitimate. Erwin Chemerinsky, the liberal dean of the University of California (Irvine) law school, argues that it's proper because of Congress' spending power. Ilya Shapiro of the libertarian Cato Institute counters that the 10th Amendment's assigning of all unlisted powers to the states makes it  ""plain and obvious that there is no constitutional authority"" for it.

Regardless, on the issue raised by Reid's ad -- whether Sharron Angle ""would eliminate the Department of Education"" -- we found that yes, she did say she wanted to do so in several public forums. So we rate the Reid ad True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/01/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-sharron-angle-wants-eliminate-educ/
"['Crime', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Gov. Charlie Crist says Florida's crime rate is lowest since 1971
","
On his campaign website for his independent bid for U.S. Senate, Gov. Charlie Crist touts public safety laws enacted during his tenure as governor including the ""Anti-Murder Act"" that sends violent felony offenders who violate probation back to jail, a law requiring criminals to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences, and the Jessica Lunsford Act to protect children from sex offenders.

""Due to these important policies and laws, Florida is enjoying its lowest crime rate in 39 years.""

For this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to explore whether the state's crime rate is the lowest it has been in 39 years.

We turned to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which issued a press release on April 7, 2010, stating in the headline ""Governor Crist announces lowest crime rate in 39 years.""

The purpose of the press release was to announce the state's Annual Uniform Crime Report for 2009. The press release stated that ""the report indicates the state’s overall index crime rate has reached a 39-year low, declining by 6.4 percent in 2009, compared to 2008. The number of violent crimes (murder, forcible sex offenses, robbery and aggravated assault) committed in Florida dropped 10 percent last year; the number of non-violent crimes (burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft) decreased 6.2 percent.""

The report includes offenses reported during 2009 and data submitted by 409 of the 415 local, county and state law enforcement agencies that serve approximately 99.9 percent of the state’s population, according to the press release. 
The FDLE's website includes a chart of crime stats starting in 1971. For 1971 it states that Florida's population was about 7.04 million and the total number of crimes was 399,055. Those numbers translated to a rate of 5,667.5 crimes per 100,000 people. By 2009, the state's population had risen to about 18.75 million and the total number of crimes was 824,559. That translated to a crime rate of 4,397.5 crimes per 100,000 -- or the lowest since the state started counting in 1971.

So clearly the crime rate in 2009 was the lowest it had been since 1971.

But it's worth noting that the drop in the crime rate below the 1971 figure -- 5,667.5 -- occurred years before Crist became governor in January 2007. The rate fell to 5,604.3 in 2000 and then stayed below that 1971 figure every year since. The rate was 4,632 in 2006, rose to 4,694.7 in 2007, rose to 4,699.8 in 2008 and then fell to 4,397.5. In other words, for two of Crist's years in office as governor the crime rate increased while in one year it decreased.

We asked Crist campaign spokesman Danny Kanner if Crist should get credit for the crime rate dropping to the lowest rate in 39 years if it had already dropped below that 1971 rate before he took office

Kanner wrote back:

""If the statement is 'Florida is enjoying its lowest crime rate in 39 years,' that means it's lower with Crist as governor than the years prior to the time he took office dating back 39 years, which is true.""

We wondered did FDLE collect the data the same way in 1971 as it did for 2009? We spoke to Kristen Chernosky, a spokeswoman at FDLE. She said that FDLE collected the data in 1971 the same as today -- by asking law enforcement agencies across the state to voluntarily submit it. We asked: Did the vast majority comply during the first year?

Chernosky said there were 334 agencies that reported in 1971 but Chernosky was uncertain how many agencies existed at that time so she didn't have a percentage of reporting compliance.

Of course, crime statistics are only as good as the agencies that report them. In at least a few high-profile instances, South Florida police agencies were accused of doctoring crime reports:

* In Boca Raton in 1998, investigators concluded that a captain altered nearly 400 crime reports the previous year to make them look less serious than they were. The original list sent to the FDLE reported 3,250 crimes while the correct list reported 3,635 crimes, the Miami Herald reported in 1998.

* In Broward County, the state attorney's office launched an investigation in 2003 into allegations that Broward Sheriff's Office deputies manipulated crime statistics by using ""exceptional clearances"" -- when a crime is declared solved despite making no arrests, according to a Jan. 6, 2008, Miami Herald article. Deputies were accused of doctoring stats by making up false confessions and pinning crimes on the wrong individuals.

* After complaints by a police union in Miami, in 2007 the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigated allegations that Miami police doctored crime statistics to make the city appear safer than it was. An Oct. 6, 2007, article in the Miami Herald stated that the reporter found ""dozens of reports that were classified as less-serious offenses than the facts in the reports would indicate."" The FBI and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement found no evidence of a systematic effort to suppress crime numbers.

But fudging crime stats is nothing new, said Dennis Jay Kenney, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.

""There is no reason to believe the cheating is any worse now than it was 20 years ago -- that is a longstanding problem,'' he said. Kenney said it's possible to argue that the auditing procedures today are better than in the past but still ""yes they can cheat.""

So how does Crist's claim stack up? He's right on the math that the state's crime rate in 2009 was lower than it was in 1971. But Crist omits that it had dropped below the 1971 rate before he became governor and that the rate went up his first two years in office. So for that omission, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/01/charlie-crist/crist-says-floridas-crime-rate-lower-1971/

In a blog post published Aug. 31, 2010, Democratic operative Steven Schale said Marco Rubio is amassing enough of the Republican vote to keep Crist out of the U.S. Senate. But that's not Crist's biggest hurdle, Schale wrote.

""The bigger problem is (Crist) is falling into the same place as many other long time office holders: his personal approval numbers are plummeting,"" wrote Schale, who is supporting but not working for Democrat Kendrick Meek. ""He no longer has that deep well of cross party lines personal support built up that allows him to transcend normal political divides. Instead, he now has to block and tackle like everyone else. In this political environment, absent some significant and unfortunate event that would thrust him back into the spotlight, the odds of him finding 15-20 points of political approval in the next nine weeks are slim, at best.""

Schale's message has been spread by both Democrats and Republicans on the Internet. We wanted to see if it was true. Are Crist's personal approval ratings plummeting? 
Looking at the polls 
Pollsters measure Crist's performance two ways -- his job approval rating (approve or disapprove) and his personal favorable rating (favorable or unfavorable).

The website Pollster.com accumulates the polls of several organizations, plots their results on a graph, and keeps a rolling average. It has tracked Crist's personal favorable rating since October 2008 and his job approval numbers since September 2008. This is the polling site Schale sent to us to back up his claim.

A crude examination of responses to both questions shows that Crist is receiving less support.

Take a look at both Pollster.com graphs.

About 60 percent of voters approved of Crist's job performance in September 2008. The percentage remained relatively unchanged until June 2009 when Crist's job approval rating began to decline. Polls bottomed out at a little over 50 percent in February 2010, before rebounding slightly. The most recent polls have Crist's approval number closer to 55 percent with disapproval numbers in the high 30s or low 40s, depending on the specific poll. (If you click on the poll below, you'll go to Pollster.com, where you can create graphs by individual polling group). 
 
 
Crist's favorable/unfavorable rating has fewer poll samples to examine. The Pollster.com aggregation shows a slow, but steady decline since October 2008. Polls in late 2008 had Crist's favorables in the high 60s where most polls now put Crist's favorable rating in the low to mid 50s. 
 
 
We're not sure either result constitutes plummeting. In fact, opinions of Crist haven't really changed that much in eight months, according to the Pollster.com trend lines. Merriam-Webster defines plummet as to fall perpendicularly  or
to drop sharply and abruptly. 
That said, a more detailed examination of the polls that make up Pollster.com shows a bigger problem with making generalizations about the data.

Quinnipiac, for instance, has polled Crist's favorable rating 12 times since late 2008. Crist peaked at 68 percent favorable in a February 2009 Q poll before dropping to 48 percent favorable in early April 2010. But his favorable rating has in fact rebounded some, and sits at 53 percent according to Quinnipiac's most recent poll.

What happened between the bottom in April and now? Crist left the Republican Party.

Quinnipiac's job approval ratings mirror the same pattern -- started in 2008 at 61 percent, bottomed out in April 2010 at 49 percent, but rebounded to 56 percent by August. That's just a 5 percentage point drop -- from a poll with a 3 percent margin of error -- in almost two years.

In both cases Crist's numbers are lower than were they were two years ago, but also higher than they were four months ago.

Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, a group that polls nationwide, said Crist's personal numbers are very strong.

""A 56 percent job approval rating, in this economy, for a sitting governor, is very good,"" said Brown, who then launched into a comparison with Ohio Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland.

Strickland, who is running for re-election, has a job approval rating around 41 percent, with more people disapproving of his time in office. And more people have an unfavorable opinion of him than a favorable one.

""Here's my point. If Charlie Crist is getting more Democrats than Kendrick Meek, Charlie Crist is very likely to be the next senator from Florida,"" Brown said. ""And he is (getting more Democrats) in our latest poll.""

Now take the Rasmussen polls, which show big swings in favorable/unfavorable ratings of Crist. In March 2010, Crist had a 49 percent favorable rating, and a 48 percent unfavorable rating. In Rasmussen's last poll in July, his numbers had dramatically improved. Rasmussen reported a favorable rating of 69 percent, Crist's highest rating in any poll since October 2008 and the highest ever rating for Crist in a Rasmussen poll.

For the record, the same Rasmussen poll had Rubio slightly ahead of Crist in a three-way Senate race, with Meek a distant third.

Ipsos, which conducted polling for the St. Petersburg Times, Miami Herald, Bay News 9 and Central Florida News 13, in May and August, said Crist's job approval rating has remained steady at a little over 50 percent.

That ""is pretty decent considering the amount of time he's been in office and his decision to leave his party,"" said Julia Clark with Ipsos.

In its poll, Ipsos also asked voters whether Crist's decision to leave the Republican Party and run as an independent made people more or less likely to vote for him. About one in five, 22 percent, say it made them more likely to vote for him, and the same proportion, 21 percent, say it made them less likely to vote for him. Half, 49 percent, say it hasn't changed their view. 
Our ruling 
Bottom line, polls are numbers and depending on what poll you're looking at and what time period you're examining, you can reach different but defendable positions. Rasmussen had Crist's job approval rating at nearly 70 percent in July, the second highest it's ever been.

Quinnipiac polled Crist's job approval rating down 5 percentage points since 2008. The polling group found that Crist's favorable rating, meanwhile, dropped a total of 20 points from 2008 to 2009, before bouncing back.

Schale said Crist's personal approval numbers are ""plummeting."" Pollster.com's tracking of several polls starting in October 2008 shows that Crist's favorable rating has declined among voters from around 70 percent, to between 50 and 55 percent. But Crist's position in voters' minds hasn't changed all that much for most of 2010, and even has rebounded a little in some polls, according to the same figures.

His job approval ratings, meanwhile, haven't changed all that much in nearly two years.

And pollsters say his numbers remain solid.

Joe Sestak hits Pat Toomey for supporting zero corporate taxes
","
In their hard-fought race for a Pennsylvania Senate seat, Republican Pat Toomey and Democrat Joe Sestak have attacked each other over tax policy. Last week, we rated a Toomey ad blasting Sestak on the estate tax as Barely True. Now we'll look at a Sestak ad attacking Toomey's position on corporate taxes.

The ad, funded by Sestak's campaign, features a clip of Toomey being interviewed on television. Here's the text of the ad:

Narrator: ""Do you think corporations pay their fair share? Pat Toomey thinks corporations shouldn't pay any taxes.""

Clip of Toomey: ""Lets not tax corporations. ... I think the solution is to eliminate corporate taxes altogether.""

Narrator: ""The middle class is struggling, but Toomey thinks it's oil companies and Wall Street banks who should pay no taxes. Zero. No wonder Toomey has been call Wall Street's congressman.""

Clip of Toomey: ""I think the solution is to eliminate corporate taxes altogether.""

Narrator: ""Pat Toomey. He's for them, not for us.""

We decided to look at whether Toomey really wants corporations to pay zero taxes.

We managed to locate the source of the video clip. It was a July 20, 2007, interview on the business network CNBC. At the time, Toomey, a former congressman from Pennsylvania, was the head of the fiscally conservative Club for Growth. He was paired on the show with Jason Furman, then a scholar at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution and now a member of President Barack Obama's National Economic Council. They appeared during a segment titled, ""Is the U.S. corporate tax code hurting America?""

Toomey began by arguing that taxes on corporations are passed through to ordinary people, which ends up hurting economic growth. The two guests then sparred a bit over whether corporate taxes in the U.S. are really the second-highest in the world, as Toomey suggested. Furman argued that widespread loopholes and exclusions lower the effective rates on companies well below the official rates.

Then Toomey said, ""I would disagree with the idea we would want to have a corporate tax burden at all. It just doesn't make sense. ... Let's allow (corporations) to compete most aggressively on the global economy. It is better for our workers and economy and attracts more capital. I think the solution is to eliminate corporate taxes altogether.""

A bit later, Toomey reiterates the point, saying about taxes, ""I’d prefer none on corporations, but much lower would be better.""

So is that actually Toomey's stance? In an interview, a spokeswoman for Toomey, Nachama Soloveichik, characterized his stance in the CNBC discussion as ""an intellectual exercise"" that is ""not part of his general policy proposal."" Soloveichik said that Toomey ""unambiguously supports lowering taxes on business"" but knows that a zero corporate tax rate is ""impractical.""

Toomey's campaign website backs up the idea that he's not affirmatively pushing for zero corporate taxes as a campaign plan, saying in its tax policy section that the candidate supports ""cutting income taxes on American businesses."" That wording suggests that business taxes should be reduced, not eliminated. Soloveichik also said that, in a questionnaire Toomey answered for the Pennsylvania Bar Association in July 2010, he wrote that ""two things in particular would go a long way towards lowering the country’s tax burden and increasing prosperity and jobs,"" one of which ""is lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate.""

But the clearest evidence of Toomey's views come from his 2009 book, The Road to Prosperity: How to Grow Our Economy and Revive the American Dream. In the book, Toomey wrote favorably about both the flat tax and the fair tax -- two conservative policy proposals that would scrap the current tax code. The flat tax would impose a single, lower tax rate on income above a fixed amount, without loopholes and specialized taxes. The fair tax, for its part, would eliminate taxes on all kinds of income and instead impose a national sales tax.

Under the flat tax Toomey described in his book, businesses would pay a 17 percent tax on income, rather than the current top rate of 35 percent. That's a reduction rather than an elimination. Under the fair tax, businesses wouldn't be taxed at all. This suggests that Toomey isn't settled on one approach to corporate taxation but is open to alternatives.

In fact, in the book, Toomey writes that he'd be ""thrilled to wake up one morning and discover our current monstrous tax code had been replaced with either of these alternatives."" But he added that his ""preference lies with the flat tax"" -- that is, the one that would levy a 17 percent tax on businesses, not the one that would scrap them entirely. In fact, Toomey later notes that the fair tax is ""a hard reform to sell in a political campaign"" because ""it can easily be mischaracterized by political opponents."" 
We gave the Toomey camp the opportunity to say the candidate opposes zero corporate taxation, but the campaign did not do so. 
So the evidence suggests that Toomey (1) affirmatively supports lower corporate taxation, (2) is open to zero corporate taxation, and (3) is politically careful enough to settle for lower corporate taxes rather than none at all.

We think that Sestak's use of the clip was fair politics, because the clip accurately reflects what Toomey said on the show. And Toomey's book does provide evidence that he'd love to see zero corporate taxation implemented, which justifies the ad's use of the word ""thinks."" On the other hand, we think a viewer watching the Sestak ad would be led to believe that Toomey is actively pushing zero corporate taxation as a campaign plank, when in fact his campaign website makes no mention of such a policy, and when Toomey has acknowledged in writing that he's wary of pursuing such a proposal because of the potential political fallout. So the ad is generally correct about Toomey's policy preferences but misleading about what he actually advocates as a candidate. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/01/joe-sestak/joe-sestak-hits-pat-toomey-supporting-zero-corpora/

Rick Scott says $36 million for disability waiting list a first in eight years
","
In 2011, Republican Gov. Rick Scott gave his State of the State address to a tea party rally in Eustis. He called for spending and tax cuts and bashed Washington, D.C.

Flash-forward two years later, and Scott’s State of the State called for helping the poor by expanding Medicaid, boosting teacher pay and increasing funds to help people with disabilities.

""For the first time in eight years, our budget also increases funding for persons with disabilities by $36 million to help more disabled people receive community-based services, and $2.5 million for job training.""

An image of a softer, kinder governor? Yep. But were his words accurate?

We decided to research if Scott has proposed more money to help more people with disabilities receive services, and if that occurred for the first time in eight years. (Scott’s tenure started in 2011.)

A wait list of 22,000

On Feb. 8, Scott held an event at the Association for the Development of the Exceptional in Miami to announce that his budget proposal included the $36 million. The money will serve people with disabilities on a waiting list for a Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Medicaid waiver. The Legislature will have to agree to the money earmarked for the waitlist.

The state-federal program serves people with intellectual disabilities, autism, cerebral palsy or other disabilities in their homes or community -- rather than sending them to more costly institutions. The $36 million increase includes about $15 million from the state and $21.2 million from the federal government.

""That means we’ll help families by providing personal care assistance, transportation, adult day training, and other needed services to improve their quality of life and find job opportunities,"" Scott said in February.

Currently, about 30,000 Floridians have such a waiver, but there are another 22,000 on the waiting list. How many people will be served by the additional money? About 750. That means the extra money will only help a small slice of those waiting for services.

""We as providers and we as advocates say thank you, but we’d like to see the state, the governor and the agency do more because 1,000 out of 22,000 is not going to be a significant number,"" said Clint Bower, president of Miami-based MACTown, which serves Floridians on the waiver.

And even if Florida reduces the waiting list, it will still lag behind most other states. Florida’s waiting list was the sixth-longest in the country in 2010 (Texas had the longest), according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Though a long waiting list isn’t surprising considering Florida’s large population, some states simply fund the services, without making people wait for specific waiver. 
Some Floridians have been on the waiting list for 10 years, said Deborah Linton, director of The Arc of Florida.

""The other day a woman who was 92 years old called us and she still cares for her adult son with no assistance!"" Linton told PolitiFact Florida in an email.

History of waiver funding

Scott talked about the amount of money budgeted for the program. In recent years, expenditures have often soared above initial appropriations (one year by as much as $166 million), resulting in massive deficits.

The deficits were so big that in 2011, Scott said he would slash rates charged by group homes and caseworkers, which drew criticism from advocates. He quickly reversed that plan when legislators agreed to back fill a deficit.

A chart compiled by the Florida Association of Rehabilitation Facilities shows expenditures peaked at about $975 million in 2010-11. Data from the state’s Agency for Persons with Disabilities shows the highest amount budgeted was about $957 million in 2007-08. For 2013-14, Scott’s proposed budget for the program is about $905 million -- substantially less than the program’s budget a few years ago.

But Scott’s claim was that for the first time in eight years the budget would increase funding to help more people receive services. The last significant jump in the number of clients -- about a 5,000 increase -- was between the 2004-05 and 2005-06 years. The Legislature earmarked about $27 million then to take more people off the waitlist.

And the next year the deficits started. The Legislature earmarked waiting list money in 2006-07 too, but due to the deficits it didn’t truly go to easing the waitlist.

That means Scott’s math is correct when he looks at his 2013-14 budget proposal and points to the last significant increase in clients served eight years ago.

Advocates told PolitiFact Florida that for the most part in recent years, the only new clients added have been through lawsuits or those in crisis -- for example, their parent-caregiver dies. Scott’s additional dollars would allow other people to get off the waitlist.

Meanwhile, the state Agency for Persons with Disabilities is phasing in a new program for people who receive the waiver, giving them a set budget and choices on how to spend it. The state expects that will reduce costs per client, freeing up spots on the waitlist. Miami-Dade, Broward and Monroe counties will be next to phase in the new budget program which has resulted in about 40 percent of the clients getting a reduction in money, said Barbara Palmer, APD director.

While that is good news for reducing the deficit, the funding change has met resistance from some clients. About 2,000 Floridians have appealed their new waiver amount, according to Linton.

""We must be careful to still fulfill the needs of the individuals currently on the waiver to protect their health and safety while trying to serve even more,"" she told PolitiFact in an email.

Our ruling

During his State of the State speech, Scott said ""For the first time in eight years, our budget also increases funding for persons with disabilities by $36 million to help more disabled people receive community-based services...""

Scott has proposed $36 million that should help at least 750 people with disabilities on the waiting list for the waiver. The last time the state increased funding to allow a significant increase in clients was eight years ago.

However, Scott omitted that about 21,000 would remain on the waiting list. And due to other budgetary changes, some people are getting less money to spend on services.

"['New Jersey', 'Guns', 'James Florio']","
Jim Florio claims the number of guns in the U.S. is almost as big as the population

","
As the gun violence debate rages on across the nation, a former New Jersey governor is offering a statistic about the prevalence of weapons in the United States.

""We have over 300,000,000 weapons, firearms in this country. That’s almost as big as the population,"" Florio said during an interview for Governors’ Perspective, an occasional segment for ""On the Record"" with Michael Aron on NJTV that aired Feb. 16. Former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman also participated in the interview.

Florio’s statistic seems pretty high – there are almost as many firearms as people in the United States?

He’s correct.

First, let’s review population totals.  As of Monday, the U.S. Census Bureau’s POPClock lists the nation’s population as 315,433,299.

Now let’s look into that guns figure.

Florio, a Democrat, told us he got the number from New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s Mayors Against Illegal Guns coalition.

""All of the gun control organizations use it,"" Florio said. ""No one has really refuted it.""

The coalition of more than 850 mayors from across the country works to prevent criminals from getting guns illegally while also supporting legal gun ownership, according to its website.

It’s worth noting that the National Rifle Association even cites the statistic, based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

""The number of privately owned guns in the U.S. is at an all-time high, upwards of 300 million, and now rises by about 10 million per year,"" the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action said in a firearms safety fact sheet released Jan. 17.

Donna Sellers, a spokeswoman for the ATF in Washington, said there is no national firearms registry, except for those firearms defined in the National Firearms Act, and instead pointed us to manufacturing and import/export reports maintained on the ATF website.

""We would have no way of knowing how many firearms there are,"" Sellers said.

Florio also is correct that other gun-control organizations cite the 300 million figure.

The Brady Campaign to End Gun Violence directed us to a September 2010 Gun Control Facts report that looks at population, gun manufacturing in the United States, ownership, crimes and more.

""As of 2009, the United States has a population of 307 million people. Based on production data from firearm manufacturers, there are roughly 300 million firearms owned by civilians in the United States as of 2010,"" the report by James D. Agresti and Reid K. Smith stated.

""There’s no perfect estimate of firearms in the U.S. because creating a national registry of firearms is prohibited by federal law,"" Alex Katz, a spokesman for Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said in an e-mail. ""But academics and interest groups across the political spectrum broadly agree on the 300 million figure.""

A November 2012 report titled ""Gun Control Legislation"" from the Congressional Research Service also supports that number.

As of 2009, the report states, ""the estimated total number of firearms available to civilians in the United States had increased to approximately 310 million: 114 million handguns, 110 million rifles, and 86 million shotguns.""

Our ruling

Florio said during a recent television interview, ""We have over 300,000,000 weapons, firearms in this country. That’s almost as big as the population.""

Data from a variety of sources including the Congressional Research Service, NRA and others confirm the 300 million figure. While population and firearms figures have fluctuated over the years, Florio’s point is clear: there’s nearly one gun for every person in the United States. We rate his claim True.

"['Rhode Island', 'Regulation', 'Guns', 'Linda Finn']","
State Rep. Linda Finn says Rhode Island keeps registry of campers but not guns
","
Amid the vociferous national gun debate prompted by the Newtown, Conn., elementary school massacre, advocates for tightening gun laws often argue that authorities need to keep better track of weapons and their owners.

People must register cars and other vehicles, so they should also be required to register firearms, they assert.

In Rhode Island, state Rep. Linda Finn, D-Middletown, has submitted a bill that would do just that.

Finn’s bill, H-5573, would require Rhode Island residents to register their guns with local officials and pay a $100 fee per weapon. Failure to do so could result in up to three years in prison and up to a $3,000 fine.

Finn says her objective is to give local law enforcement basic information about who owns guns in the communities.

""Wouldn’t it be safer for them to know if they’re being called to a home that has a gun in it, or if they’re pulling over a person who has a gun?"" she said in a Feb. 26 news release.

She added: ""Rhode Island could tell you who has a camper, but we couldn't figure out who has a gun.""

Finn’s proposal drew hundreds of gun owners to the Rhode Island State House who argued that the bill violates the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and is a knee-jerk reaction that would not solve anything.

When we asked Finn about her comparison of campers and guns, she said she was referring to what local authorities can quickly ascertain as they respond to an incident.

If a camper such as a trailer or RV were involved in a crime, she said, authorities could quickly determine its owner and other information about it, but could not do the same for a gun because Rhode Island does not allow a central registry of private firearms.

We looked at her statement in two parts.

First, we confirmed with the state Division of Motor Vehicles that it requires registration of who owns campers used on roadways and keeps such a registry with information that can be accessed by the police.

Next, we examined Rhode Island’s gun laws. Statutes 11-47-35 and 11-47-35.2  say that anyone purchasing a handgun or rifle from a dealer must fill out an application, which is sent to the local police chief or state police for review. If there are no objections, the purchaser gets the gun after a seven-day waiting period.

The same statutes require the authorities to destroy the copies of the applications they received after they are reviewed.

And Statute 11-47-41 specifically forbids any ""government agency of the state"" or its ""political subdivisions"" to keep any list of privately owned guns or gun owners.

Rhode Island does, however, have a record of people who receive a permit to carry a pistol or revolver, both concealed and not concealed. A person must apply to the either the state Department of Attorney General or to a local police department, which decide whether to grant such a permit.

The Department of Attorney General has a database of permits to carry a pistol or revolver, which must be renewed every four years.

As of Dec. 31, 2012, the attorney general’s office had on record 3,403 active permits to carry a pistol or revolver, concealed and not concealed, that its office has issued over the years.

The attorney general’s office does not share its database with the police or other authorities because that is prohibited by law, according to Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin. Rather, the office simply confirms a permit holder’s information to a law enforcement agency if requested during an individual stop or arrest. The attorney general’s office also does not have information on permits to carry issued by local police departments.

Another provision of Rhode Island law -- 11-47-40 -- says all federally licensed gun dealers/sellers must keep a register of sales: dates, purchasers and type of firearm. But gun sellers are not government departments or agencies.

Our ruling

State Rep. Linda Finn, D-Middletown, said, ""Rhode Island could tell you who has a camper, but we couldn't figure out who has a gun.""

Finn is right in that there is no central registry accessible to authorities for all guns or gun owners in Rhode Island.

However, there is a subset of thousands of people who have permits to carry weapons that is maintained by the Department of Attorney General or by local police. It’s far from a complete list of every gun or gun owner and the police can access it only on a case-by- case basis.

But that’s enough to nudge the Truth-O-Meter ruling to Mostly True.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Al Cardenas']","
Al Cardenas says of $60B Congress approved after Hurricane Sandy, 'only 10 percent was for disaster relief'
","
In the weeks since Congress approved aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy, conservatives have explained their opposition by saying the bill was loaded with political pork.

Al Cardenas, the former chairman of the Republican Party of Florida who now heads the American Conservative Union, said the vast majority of the bill went beyond disaster relief.

""Congress just adopted a $60 billion stimulus package, of which only 10 percent was for disaster relief. Now, I can't for the life of me understand why a good conservative would want to promote the $60 billion pork barrel bill, when in reality all we needed to do was approve a $10 billion disaster relief bill,"" Cardenas told MSNBC’s Morning Joe on March 1, 2013.

Is it true that of the $60 billion, just 10 percent was for disaster relief?

10 percent

Sandy, a hurricane so sprawling it's often called a ""superstorm,"" hit the United States in late October, devastating parts of the Atlantic coast, particularly New York and New Jersey. A company that models risk for insurance companies estimated a few days after the storm insured losses of $10 billion to $20 billion and economic damage of $30 billion to $50 billion.

The governors of New York and New Jersey requested billions in federal aid. But an emergency spending package died in the House in December 2012 in the breathless last hours of the 112th Congress, as lawmakers passed a deal to avert the fiscal cliff. Christie blamed House Speaker John Boehner.

On Jan. 4, Congress passed a bill to increase the borrowing authority of the Federal Emergency Management Agency by $9.7 billion to process flood claims. On Jan. 28, it passed H.R. 152, a separate $50.5 billion package. Of that $50.5 billion, $17 billion went toward immediate Sandy aid, while $33.5 billion was for ""near- and long-term assistance and mitigation,"" according to a Congressional Quarterly analysis.

Nearly all the money was handled as emergency spending — conveniently allowing lawmakers to ignore caps on discretionary spending.

It’s less clear, however, exactly how much of it was ultimately for ""disaster relief"" — a definition that changes depending on whom you ask.

Still, potential spending for flood insurance alone — nearly $10 billion — was more than the 10 percent (or $6 billion) that Cardenas claimed.

Add in the $17 billion that House Republicans called ""immediate support to the victims and communities impacted by Hurricane Sandy"" — aid such as emergency food assistance, Army Corps of Engineers repairs, disaster loans, small business grants, and training and employment services — and it totals at least 40 percent without even considering longer-term aid in the bill.

President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on Jan. 29.

We asked the American Conservative Union about Cardenas' comments.

The 10 percent? ""He misspoke,"" said Larry Hart, ACU’s director of government relations.

""You can see in the next sentence, which uses the figure of $10 billion,"" Hart said.

But our calculations show that number is also wrong. Did he mean the appropriations for flood insurance? Some part of the $17 billion package?

""He was saying that the estimate was that there was about $10 billion in emergency aid needed,"" Hart said. ""He was not doing a legal budget analysis of the bill.""

We pointed out that Cardenas had made similar comments in an email to Politico, saying the ""$60-plus billion pork barrel bill"" contained ""only $9 billion in disaster assistance.""

We didn’t get any further explanation of the number.  

Instead, Hart maintained that ""the exact figure is not the issue"" and cited spending in the full $60.2 billion package that wasn’t ""immediate disaster relief,"" such as:

• $3.5 billion for the Corps of Engineers for future mitigation efforts to protect against climate change.

• $17 billion in Community Development Block Grants for any states with disaster declarations since 2011, because of their history as ""a political slush fund,"" especially since $2 billion was ""to mitigate future risks, not existing damage.""

• $2 billion for U.S. Housing and Urban Development to be used for ""long-term recovery … and economic revitalization.""

• $200 million for Health and Human Services ""to be used at the discretion of the secretary.""

• $5.3 billion in transportation money that can be used for projects ""related to reducing risk of damage from future disasters.""

Of course, on MSNBC, Cardenas didn’t specify ""immediate"" disaster relief.

Still, Taxpayers for Common Sense identified billions in H.R. 152 that wasn’t Sandy-related, including $2 billion for the federal highway system and $25 million to improve weather forecasting.

Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonpartisan budget group, pointed out that it’s hard to say what percentage of the emergency spending package will ultimately go for disaster relief.

""I can't tell you what percent is disaster relief until I see where it gets spent,"" he said.

A big portion of the $17 billion in ""immediate"" assistance, more than $5 billion, went to replenish FEMA’s disaster relief fund, which may fund relief from future disasters, Ellis said. It’s not yet clear where funding for some other agencies, such as Housing and Urban Development and the Army Corps of Engineers, will go. Meanwhile, of the $9.7 billion to authorize additional borrowing for FEMA’s flood insurance program, some could go toward relief from future disasters, he said.

Still, Cardenas suggested just $6 billion of Congress’ aid package ""was for disaster relief."" But just the very narrow appropriations for FEMA’s disaster relief fund and flood insurance program more than double that number, even if it may not all go to Sandy victims.

Our ruling

Cardenas was specific with his numbers, but his own organization says he misspoke. Our math shows that the $15 billion for FEMA disaster relief and flood insurance alone are more than double what Cardenas claimed. And while Ellis raises some valid questions about how much of the $60 billion package will ultimately go to disaster relief, we find it will be significantly more than Cardenas said.

"['Oregon', 'State Budget', 'Doug Whitsett']","
Would Oregon's budget be dramatically smaller if pegged to population growth?
","
Fiscally conservative members of the Oregon Legislature never much like the size of the state’s budget. But once something is funded, it’s never easy to muster the political willpower to take the cash away.

In a recent opinion piece for The Oregonian, Sen. Doug Whitsett, a Republican from Klamath Falls, offered a creative solution: Peg state spending to population growth and inflation.

""Oregon desperately needs to establish a constitutional limit on the growth of state spending,"" he wrote. He maintains that the $60 billion all-funds budget is growing out of control.

Whitsett noted that the state’s Legislative Fiscal Office, which keeps a close eye on the budget, had illustrated ""for purpose of comparisons"" what Oregon’s all-funds budget would look like today if his proposal had been implemented 20 years ago.

""Oregon spent about $20 billion in all-funds budgets 20 years ago,"" he wrote. ""With this spending limit in place, the state’s all-funds budget would be about $27 billion today.""

That’s a nearly $33 billion difference. A huge amount of money for a state like Oregon. So huge, in fact, that PolitiFact Oregon wanted to know whether Whitsett was right.

We spoke with Whitsett, who said that he’d gotten this statistic from a presentation that the fiscal office had given at the beginning of the current legislative session. So we called Ken Rocco, the office’s director, and asked him if he remembered this.

Rocco got back to us via e-mail. He offered two pieces of caution.

First: There was no reason in particular that his office chose the budget from 20 years ago to use for their projection.

Second: The data the senator had referred to in his opinion piece hadn’t been calculated accurately. ""In looking at this chart, the data presented claimed it was inflating the 1991-93 base year by both inflation and population growth, but when I looked more closely at the data today, it was actually only for inflation.""

In fact, he noted, if the calculations been done right, the actual 2011-13 budget -- pegged to population growth and inflation -- would be about $36 billion. ""This was not the Senator’s mistake, but LFO’s,"" Rocco noted.

Nevertheless, the point Whitsett was trying to make -- that spending growth has happened beyond just normal population growth -- remains true, Rocco said. ""There are a number of other drivers to budget growth than simply inflation and population increases, such as specific caseload growth, additional mandate programs that require funding, etc.""

Let us point out here that the all-funds budget is just that -- all funds. It includes not only the general fund, which lawmakers can allocate however they choose, but also federal money, bond revenue, gas taxes, fees -- in short, a whole lot of money dedicated for specific purposes.

Now, allow us to offer up a slight tangent. Whitsett’s idea is not entirely new. Back in 2006, Measure 48 was put on the Oregon ballot. That measure would have limited any increase in state spending to population growth and inflation increases.

It turned out, this had nothing to do with what Whitsett was writing about, but we bring it up because it illustrates an important point: Measure 48 didn’t apply to things like federal funds. That’s huge given that nearly a fourth of the state budget comes from federal funds.

For instance, about $15 billion of the upcoming all-funds budget comes from federal sources -- that’s about a quarter of the total. Twenty years ago, federal funds only accounted for about 15 percent of the total.  If you were to play by Measure 48’s rules and add that chunk of change to the $36 billion that the fiscal office projected, you’d get an all-funds budget closer to $42 billion.

That, of course would still mean about $18 billion in less budget growth over 20 years. That is no small thing -- but it’s still a lot closer to the current all-funds budget than the initial $27 billion Whitsett mentioned.

Whitsett also pointed out, during an interview, that it would be a mistake to assume the federal government will keep providing a quarter of the state’s all-funds budget. ""At some point in time that has to reverse … the current sequester might be a part of that.""

Whitsett said that if we had curbed budget growth 20 years ago by pegging it to population growth and inflation, our budget would be about $27 billion today instead of $60 billion. He was referring to an inaccurate calculation made by a typically unimpeachable source. The figure is actually closer to $36 billion.

We won’t hold their error against Whitsett, but we do think it’s important to note that, if federal funds are a concern at all, our budget wouldn’t be quite as slight as Whitsett predicted.

Garnet Coleman says Texas has the most uninsured residents of any state--6 million
","
A Democratic state legislator aired a familiar — and flawed — claim on a Dallas TV station.

On the Feb. 10, 2013, edition of WFAA-TV’s ""Inside Texas Politics,"" Rep. Garnet Coleman of Houston, who hopes that Texas follows Florida and other states in opening Medicaid to more people, said: ""We have the most uninsured people of any other state; it’s 6 million people."" 
His remark was similar to a recent claim by the editorial board of the Sacramento Bee, which said Texas has the most uninsured residents. We rated that Mostly False after finding that more populous California has more uninsured residents.

Drawing on U.S. Census Bureau research, the Kaiser Family Foundation keeps up with how many residents of each state have health coverage.
   
Nationally in 2011, the foundation says, some 16 percent of the population was uninsured. 
In Texas, the foundation says, 24 percent of residents had no health insurance — and that was the highest uninsured rate for any state. Some 22 percent of Nevada residents and 21 percent of New Mexico residents lacked coverage, according to the foundation, while California and Louisiana were among five states where 20 percent of the population was uninsured.
   
The foundation cites as a basis for these percentages the bureau’s continuing household surveys, which suggest slightly different levels of the uninsured dependent on whether the cited survey is a one-day snapshot or one that encompasses several years.
   
Regardless, Texas has consistently had the highest uninsured rate.
   
Another foundation chart shows, as Coleman said, that Texas had more than 6.1 million uninsured residents in 2011.

But California had more, with 7.3 million uninsured, the chart says. California’s population exceeded Texas’ by some 12 million.
   
Separately, we found a lower tally for Californians under age 65 who lack coverage in a December 2012 article by Paul Fronstin of the Washington-based Employee Benefit Research Institute, which says its mission is to enhance the development of sound public policy through objective research and education.

A summary of that article opens: ""In 2011, California had the largest number of people under age 65 without health insurance — 7.1 million — of any U.S. state. The percentage of uninsured Californians has risen steadily over the past two decades; the state now has the seventh-largest percentage of residents without coverage in the United States."" The summary says, though, that the state’s share of uninsured residents should drop as the federal law known as Obamacare takes full effect.
   
By email, Fronstin previously agreed California has more uninsured than Texas, pointing to his own analysis of Census Bureau survey research released in March 2012. Still, he said, 27 percent of Texans under 65 are uninsured, compared with 22 percent of Californians.

Finally, we pulled down a bureau chart indicating the number of uninsured in each state from 1999 through 2011. Each of those years, it indicates, California had more uninsured residents than Texas, though the gap narrowed to about 500,000 residents in 2001, 2002 and 2007. California held its biggest edge in 1999 when, the bureau estimates, 6.4 million Golden State residents were uninsured compared to 4.3 million Texans.

By email, Coleman conceded that his broadcasted comment was incorrect, saying: ""Texas has the second-highest total number of uninsured people, with over 6 million uninsured,"" which he called dismal.
   
Our ruling
   
Coleman said Texas has the most uninsured residents.
   
Texas continues to have highest percentage of uninsured residents in the nation, but, in raw numbers, California has about 1 million more uninsured residents. Coleman’s claim has an element of truth, yet it’s wrong on the numbers. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/mar/06/garnet-coleman/garnet-coleman-says-texas-has-highest-number-unins/
"['Georgia', 'Federal Budget', 'Israel', 'Council for the National Interest']","
Billboards question aid to Israel
","
A message on an electronic billboard in Gwinnett County caught our eye one evening.

""$8 million a day to Israel just doesn’t make sense!"" it read.

Underneath those words, it read: ""STOP The Blank Check.org.""

Does the United States give Israel $8 million a day? Is there a ""blank check"" for Israel?

Since we’ve seen the same message on other billboards in the Atlanta region, PolitiFact Georgia thought it’d be worthwhile to figure out whether the claim is accurate or are the thousands of motorists who’ve seen this billboard being told misleading information.

The Council for the National Interest paid for the billboard. The nonprofit organization’s goal, according to its website, is support of a just resolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. It has claimed, for example, that the news media devotes more coverage to Israeli deaths rather than Palestinian deaths in Middle East violence.

Some groups, such as the Anti-Defamation League, say the council is anti-Israel and claims some leaders of its educational arm have met in recent years with terrorist leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah.

The council’s executive director, Phil Giraldi, said the group, based in northern Virginia, has about 12,000 members. The group is paying for 10 billboards in the Atlanta area and six others nationwide, he said. Giraldi said he got a good deal on billboards in Atlanta.

""We wanted to make the public aware at a time that budgets are being cut, aid to Israel is not,"" said Giraldi, who added that Israel has a ""booming"" economy. ""Whenever Israel needs more money, Congress appropriates it,"" he said.

The council’s website describes Giraldi as a former CIA counterterrorism specialist. Giraldi recently wrote a column called ""Why I Dislike Israel"" that criticized the U.S.-Israel relationship as too cozy and said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was meddling in the 2012 U.S. presidential race.

The nonpartisan, federal Congressional Research Service released a report in 2012 on U.S. foreign aid to Israel. Most of what the United States gives Israel is military aid. The report found the U.S. gave more aid to Israel than any other nation between 1976 and 2004. Afghanistan is currently at the top of the list, the report said.

Israel uses almost 75 percent of those funds to buy U.S. defense equipment. By law, Congress must be notified of most new purchase agreements. Over the years, the two nations have had occasional disputes over which weapons that contain U.S. materials can be sold to other nations.

In the mid-1990s, the CRS noted, following efforts in Congress to reduce foreign aid funding, Israel proposed (and Congress agreed) to phase out U.S. economic aid to Israel entirely. As Congress phased out economic aid to Israel from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2008, military aid gradually increased, according to the CRS.

President Barack Obama proposed spending $3.1 billion in military financing for Israel and an additional $15 million on refugee resettlement for fiscal year 2013, a 12-month period that will end Sept. 30. That’s nearly $8.5 million a day. It’s unclear what impact the sequester may have on aid to Israel.

End of story? Not yet. We were still curious about whether the United States has written a blank check to Israel, since ""STOP The Blank Check.org"" is mentioned so prominently on the billboard.

Israel is considered one of America’s closest allies, and politicians who do not strongly support that relationship do so at their own peril. A Pew Research Center poll in December found about 50 percent of Americans sympathized with Israel over the Palestinians, while just 10 percent side with the Palestinians.

For much of Obama’s first term, Republicans accused the president of damaging ties with Israel because of disagreements between his administration and the Israeli government over issues such as Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Obama’s critics also complained he hadn’t visited Israel since he took office. The president may visit Israel as soon as this month, according to some Israeli news accounts.

Some say there is no willingness in Washington to question Israel or America’s funding for it.

""There is no debate,"" said M.J. Rosenberg, director of the Washington office of the Israel Policy Forum, a left-wing organization that pushes for peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. Then, according to the Jerusalem Post, he corrected himself, saying, ""The debate is like this: ‘I like Israel.’ ‘Well, I like Israel more.’ ""

Philip Wilcox, president of the Washington-based Foundation for Middle East Peace, said he has seen the $8 million a day claim and agreed ""it’s in the ballpark."" As for whether there is a ""blank check"" for Israel, Wilcox told us that the U.S. generally accepts Israeli military actions in the region. Wilcox spent years working in the federal government on Middle East affairs. He noted, though, that the U.S. has conducted inquiries into Israeli use of weapons.

""This is really a matter of interpretation,"" Wilcox said of whether there is a blank check.

Giraldi cited Obama’s decision to fund Israel’s ""Iron Dome"" missile defense program as part of the blank check to Israel claim. In fiscal year 2011, the White House approved $205 million for the program. In July, the president provided an additional $70 million for the program.

""The United States being one-sided to Israel is not beneficial to the United States,"" Giraldi said.

Our conclusion:

The council’s billboard says the U.S. gives $8 million a day to Israel. In essence, that’s an accurate estimate. The billboard may leave the impression that there is a blank check to Israel. That’s a matter of interpretation.

Our rating: Mostly True.

Rick Scott blames 'legacy of taxing and borrowing' for poor economy he inherited
","
During his 2013 State of the State speech, Florida Gov. Rick Scott defended his record on the economy and the state’s fiscal condition during his first two years in office.

""Our Florida Families First budget"" represents ""responsible stewardship of taxpayer money,"" Scott, a Republican, said in the address. ""Washington, D.C., could learn a few budget lessons from Florida. The contrast between our state and the nation’s capital is remarkable. Now is not the time to turn back to the legacy of taxing and borrowing that crippled the economy we inherited two years ago. We must stay the course for economic growth and job creation.""

We wondered whether Scott was justified in saying that a ""legacy of taxing and borrowing … crippled the economy"" he inherited in 2010.

We should note that we are analyzing this claim using the assumption that Scott is referring to the state’s economy when he talks about the ""legacy of taxing and borrowing."" His office confirmed that he was referring to Florida's economy as the one he ""inherited"" in January 2011, not the nation’s. As evidence, they pointed us to statistics showing Florida's debt levels increased through 2010 but then declined.

To check Scott's claim, we contacted a half dozen experts on the Florida economy, primarily academic economists and analysts with financial firms. These experts were unanimous: Problems of taxing and borrowing weren’t the major causes of the severe recession the Sunshine State is still struggling out of. Real estate was, exacerbated by the reach of the national recession.

Florida real estate values appreciated by 4.1 percent annually from 1995 to 2000, and then by 11.3 percent annually between 2000 and 2003. But when the bust came, it hit hard. By 2010, nearly 14 percent of Florida home loans were in foreclosure, edging out Nevada for the highest in the nation. The serious delinquency rate for home loans in Florida peaked in the third quarter of 2010 at nearly 20 percent -- almost twice the rate of Arizona and California, two of the other hardest-hit states.

""Most economists -- maybe all economists -- think that the bursting of the housing bubble and the global financial crisis were far and away the largest factors crippling the Florida economy,"" said Bill Seyfried, professor of economics at Rollins College in Winter Park. ""State economic policy played a minimal role.""

Chris Lafakis, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics, agreed. ""Florida’s severe housing collapse, the seeds of which were sown during Jeb Bush’s governorship, combined with the national recession to deliver the Florida economy a devastating one-two punch from 2007 to 2009,"" he said. ""Tax revenues obviously fell during the recession, which you would expect to happen in any state, but there was not a substantial erosion in the state’s fiscal position sufficient to cause a downgrade in the state’s credit rating.""

Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Competitiveness, said the combination of the severe national recession, a housing bust and a financial crisis amounted to a perfect storm for the state.

""As 401(k)s  turned into 201(k)s,"" fewer retirees could move to Florida, Snaith said. This, in turn, dealt a body blow to the construction and real estate sectors. ""This tied the Florida economy’s hands behind its back,"" Snaith said. ""Those factors, more than anything, made the recession harder to recover from. … The source of the state’s woes certainly was not borrowing and spending.""

Meanwhile, tourism, a backbone of Florida’s economy, couldn’t last for long in this economic environment, said Paul M. Mason, an economist at the University of North Florida. The decline in housing values -- exacerbated by investors shifting money from housing to oil funds when petroleum prices surged in the summer of 2008 -- ""made people feel less wealthy, putting a major damper on tourism from both inside and outside the state,"" he said.

One lesson of the last recession is that the Florida economy is deeply intertwined with the national economy, experts say. ""Whatever factors contributed to the last national recession and its aftermath also contributed to the state’s recession and its aftermath,"" said Joseph DeSalvo, an economist at the University of South Florida.

As for tax rates, they would be ""an extremely low-rated cause of economic decline,"" said Elizabeth Strom, an urban and regional planning professor at the University of South Florida. ""For Florida, the national recession coupled with our economic dependence on real estate development and the huge speculative bubble that popped alongside national economic recession would have far stronger explanatory power.""

There may be one silver lining for Florida, said Scott J. Brown, senior vice president and chief economist at Raymond James Financial, based in St. Petersburg. ""Areas of the country that had larger housing bubbles, such as Florida, were going to have larger corrections,"" Brown said. ""However, with housing recovering in most areas of the country, Florida has more room for improvement in housing than most other states. Bigger bubble, bigger bust, bigger (eventual) recovery.""

Our ruling

Scott blamed a ""legacy of taxing and borrowing"" for the poor state economy he inherited. But the experts we contacted said that fiscal matters were a small factor, if at all. Real estate, the national recession, and their impacts on such key sectors as construction and tourism were the overwhelming causes. We rate Scott’s claim False.

Florida Democrats say Rick Scott cut more jobs than created in 2012
","
On the eve of Gov. Rick Scott’s third State of the State address, Florida Democrats released a lengthy memo detailing setbacks for job creation under his reign.

""After cutting more jobs than he created in Florida in 2012, failing to keep his promise to create 700,000 new jobs and a disastrous election year where the Florida GOP ‘got their teeth kicked in,’ Gov. Rick Scott is running away from everything he campaigned on to get re-elected,"" wrote Scott Arceneaux, the party’s executive director, in the March 4 memo.

His memo served up plenty of talking points for Democratic lawmakers at a press conference berating Scott’s policies later that day. ""Scott cut more jobs than he created in 2012, and the jobs he created aren’t high-quality, high-paying positions of the future,"" said Sen. Darren Soto, D-Orlando.

PolitiFact Florida is monitoring the central promise of Scott’s 2010 campaign -- creating 700,000 jobs over seven years -- on the Scott-O-Meter, where it is rated Stalled.The state has experienced positive job growth since Scott took office in January 2011, but not at the rate that he would need to meet his pledge.

With that in mind, the Democrats’ claim that Scott cut ""more jobs than he created"" sounded like it needed another look. 
We should note first that it's not right to give Scott credit (or blame) for all job growth (or losses) that happens while he is governor. Economic experts have told us that governors usually have little influence on short-term economic performance in their states. Often, national trends and general economic circumstances overwhelm the actions of a single governor.

On the other hand, public officials do have control over the size of the state workforce, and Scott made no secret of his desire to shrink the state payroll during his campaign. He said he would cut state jobs by 5 percent, a pledge we rated Promise Kept on the Scott-O-Meter.

But did he weed out state worker jobs at such a rate that it overtook private sector growth? Put simply, no.

In his memo, Arceneaux zeroed in on private vs. state government jobs in 2012.

""Since the beginning of 2012, Florida has added 7,800 private-sector jobs, but has cut 9,600 public sector jobs,"" he states in the memo, which offers an August 2012 report from the state’s Department of Economic Opportunity as back-up.

We noticed one problem right away. Arceneaux claims to make an overarching point about job losses exceeding gains for all of 2012. But the supporting evidence deals with federal labor data available through mid-August, accounting for just half of the year’s jobs picture.

We asked Florida Democratic Party spokesman Eric Conrad to explain. He sent us a 2012 news story from the Orlando Sentinel, which quoted Rollins College economics professor William Seyfried as saying Florida added about 7,800 private-sector jobs while cutting about 9,600 government positions -- this is key --so far that year.

Conrad said this was the most recent report the party had.

We found data for Florida jobs for all of 2012 from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Yes, 2012 was not kind to the state’s job market for the first half, Seyfried told us by phone. But federal data show it picked up after August.

From December 2011 to December 2012, Florida lost 10,600 total government jobs. On the other hand, the state saw an increase of 65,600 private-sector jobs. Put them together and you get an overall nonfarm jobs total of 54,900 jobs -- a net gain, which belies Arceneaux’s point.

""There’s no way one can conclude that Florida experienced a net loss of jobs in 2012,"" Seyfried said. 
Florida's 2012 economic performance mirrored the country's underwhelming job growth, said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness. 
""They pick six months (of Florida jobs data) and they say nothing about the role the Democratic president has played in a slow national recovery,"" Snaith said. 
Arceneaux’s point is focused on the worst period of job growth the state experienced with Scott as governor. The state grew more than twice as many jobs in Scott’s first year in office (122,900 private-sector jobs - 7,200 government jobs = 115,700 total nonfarm jobs). And by the end of 2012, Scott’s job creation total continued to lag mightily behind his promise of 700,000 jobs but was up to 170,600.

Our ruling

Scott Arceneaux, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party, tried to discredit Scott’s influence on Florida’s economy on the eve of his State of the State address. Putting the blame for job losses squarely on Scott’s shoulders, Arceneaux said Scott cut ""more jobs than he created in Florida in 2012.""

This claim is a bad case of cherry-picking. The Democrats honed in on the state’s bleakest period of job growth. Not only that, they held it up as a whole year’s performance.

Yeah, 2012 was sluggish for job growth, especially compared to 2011. But it was an increase nonetheless.

Florida Democrats say Rick Scott says education is not a 'core function' of state government
","
With an eye toward his 2014 re-election effort, Gov. Rick Scott has tried to portray himself as a pal of teachers and families who rely on public education. He talks often about how he boosted education spending in 2012 and this year proposed giving teachers a $2,500 pay raise.

Not surprisingly, his Democratic foes emphasize different facts and figures about education spending -- including how Scott oversaw a spending cut in 2011.

As Scott prepared to deliver his State of the State speech March 5, the Democrats ""pre-butted"" him with a press release the day before attacking his record on jobs, tax cuts and education.

""Scott, the hardcore tea party conservative who spent $5 million of his own money to defeat the Affordable Care Act and who slashed education funding by $1.3 billion, calling it not a ‘core function’ of the state, is now arguing for investments in education and the expansion of Medicaid under the President’s health care law,"" wrote the Florida Democratic Party.

Education sounds like a fairly basic government service or a ""core function."" Did Scott call education not a ""core function"" of the state?  

Scott and the use of the word ""core""

To support their claim, Democrats pointed to a February 2011 article in Jacksonville’s Florida Times-Union about Scott’s first budget proposal, which called for steep cuts to much of the budget, including education, benefits for state workers, and state jobs.  

The article quoted Scott at a Tallahassee press conference: ""The public expects us to get back to what the core functions of the state are, not things that would be nice but we don't have the money for.""

Florida Democratic Party spokesman Eric Conrad told PolitiFact Florida that Scott was talking about returning to the ""core functions"" of the state while also broadly cutting education.

""It’s kind of hard to think he considers education to be a core function if he was cutting that much money from it,"" Conrad said.

But we found no place where Scott specifically mentioned education and said it was not a ""core function"" of government. Instead, Scott talked about the core functions of government in a much more general way, saying only core functions should receive funding.

Here are some excerpts from Scott’s comments on core functions.

While unveiling his proposed budget at a tea party rally in Eustis on Feb. 7, 2011, Scott said, ""The fact is that government has to get back to its core functions. But only its core functions.""

Later in the speech, when talking about streamlining state agencies, Scott said: ""And, by eliminating programs that are not core government functions, remember we are going to go back to what the core function is, not a lot of ‘it would be nice to have,’ just like, that’s not what you get to do right now, we are going to go back to core functions, it will save us another $150 million over two years.""  

Scott did mention education in another part of his speech, saying that he would cut ""over $4 billion in taxes over the next two years without any cuts out of state general revenue for education, zero cuts out of state general revenue for education."" Actually, state funding for education shrank that year, as we noted in a 2011 fact-check.

When Scott called for selling the state airplane in February 2011, he said: ""Burdening taxpayers with these ongoing expenses is irresponsible and not a core function for government to meet the state's critical needs."" (Scott earned a Promise Kept on PolitiFact Florida’s Scott-O-Meter which keeps track of his promises.)

In April 2011, Scott was interviewed on Fox Business News and talked about eliminating teacher tenure and watching how we spend every dollar. Then he said: ""We go back to core functions. All of these things are important and we're going to get them -- we're going to get them done.""

A spokesperson for Scott did not directly address our questions about Scott’s views on what is a ""core function.""

""The governor has always said he is focused on three things: jobs, education and cost of living,"" said Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz in an email.

Our ruling

The Florida Democratic Party said in a press release that Scott called education ""not a ‘core function’ of the state.""

The Democrats point to Scott’s 2011 comments about his budget proposal that included massive and wide-ranging cuts -- including to education. Scott called for focusing on ""core functions"" of the state.

Scott cut the education budget in a year when he talked about funding for ""core functions."" But he never specifically said education was not a ""core function."" It’s a stretch and a leap of logic for Florida Democrats to claim otherwise.

Was Chief Justice John Roberts right about voting rates in Massachusetts, Mississippi?
","
Chief Justice John Roberts quizzed -- and stumped -- U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. on some deep-in-the-weeds voting statistics during a recent oral argument at the Supreme Court.

The comments came during a challenge to a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, the landmark 1965 law that ensured members of racial minorities the right to vote.

In the case before the court, Shelby County, Ala., challenged how the Voting Rights Act determines whether a state or locality needs advance approval from the U.S. Justice Department before it changes any voting laws, regulations or procedures.

The law requires advance approval for Alabama, as well as for five other southern states (Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Virginia) that demonstrated a poor historical record of allowing minorities to vote. Three other states (Alaska, Arizona and Texas) plus a variety of local jurisdictions are also subject to ""preclearance."" Shelby County argued that these requirements are outdated.

At one point in the oral argument held Feb. 27, 2013, Roberts asked Verrilli, ""Do you know which state has the worst ratio of white voter turnout to African-American voter turnout?""

Verrilli, who was defending the law as currently written, responded, ""I do not.""

Roberts said, ""Massachusetts. Do you know what has the best, where African-American turnout actually exceeds white turnout? Mississippi.""

Roberts was pointing out a striking irony -- that Massachusetts, a state well known for its liberalism, was seemingly a poor performer in protecting minority voting rights, yet Mississippi, a state for which the Voting Rights Act demands intensive federal scrutiny, actually seems to be a model of voting equality.

It would be a powerful argument for changing the law, but the comparison quickly drew criticism, including from Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin. We wondered, does the chief justice have his numbers right? And if so, do they support his point? We looked at the data and checked with a variety of experts.

We should note that the Supreme Court has declined to elaborate on Roberts’ data selection, but there is wide agreement among voting experts that he was using data from the Current Population Survey, a widely used U.S. Census Bureau survey. The survey provides data on registration and voting on a state-by-state and race-by-race basis every two years. The experts came to this conclusion because there don’t appear to be any other data sources that provide the information Roberts cited.

George Mason University political scientist Michael McDonald, who filed an amicus (or friend-of-the-court) brief supporting the current law, told PolitiFact that he believes Roberts was basing his comment on 2004 Current Population Survey data, since that year’s findings had been cited in a previous lower-court dissent in the Shelby County case. However, since Roberts didn’t specify a year during oral arguments -- and since he used the present tense -- we think a reasonable listener would assume that the chief justice is referring to the most recent data available. So we will focus on data for 2008 (the last presidential election year available) and for 2010 (the last midterm election year available).

In a moment, we’ll begin by looking at some of the problems with using Current Population Survey data to back up Roberts’ claim. After that, we’ll grant for the sake of argument that the Current Population Survey is valid for this purpose and look instead at why Roberts’ interpretation of the data is less than ideal. Finally, we’ll discuss why, despite these problems, Roberts has a reasonable point to make.

Why the Current Population Survey isn’t a good source of backup on Roberts’ point

• The survey has large margins of error for black populations. Generally speaking, any survey that collects data from a relatively small group of people will have a larger margin of error than a survey that collects data from a larger group of people. So when the Current Population Survey looks at Massachusetts, the margin of error for the figures relating to the entire state population are fairly small, but the margin of error for figures relating to the state’s African-American population (which accounts for just 6 percent of adults in the state) is bigger. With a smaller pool of African-Americans responding to the survey, there’s simply a bigger chance that a few bits of off-base data will skew the whole sample.

This appears to be what happened with Massachusetts (as well as with other states that have relatively small black populations). The survey found that in Massachusetts, 52 percent of all adult citizens voted in 2010, with a margin of error of about two percentage points. But the same survey found that 39 percent of black voters in Massachusetts voted in the same year, with a much larger margin of error of 11 points. This means the black voting rate actually may have been as high as 50 percent -- pretty close to the percentage for the state as a whole.

• The survey shows some perplexing year-to-year changes. You generally wouldn’t expect to see a large movement in the rates of voter registration from year to year, since once voters are registered, they typically stay on the rolls until they move or die. But the Current Population Survey data for voting registration among Massachusetts residents fluctuated wildly between 2008 and 2010. The registration gap between whites and blacks ballooned from 13.8 percentage points in 2008 to 36.5 percent in 2010, an almost threefold increase in just two years. Such a large change casts doubt on how reliable the Massachusetts sample is.

• The Current Population Survey has some questionable policies for coding respondents’ answers on voting questions. Last year, McDonald, the George Mason professor, began noticing some unusual patterns in the Current Population Survey’s raw data, and he wrote about it.

The survey allows one of two possible answers to the question of whether a respondent (or someone else in their household) voted in the last election: ""yes"" and ""no."" That made sense, until McDonald realized that the survey had a curiously broad definition of ""no."" With questionable logic, the survey counted three categories of answers as ""no"" -- if a respondent refused to answer the question, if the person answering the question didn’t know whether someone else in the household had voted, or if they were somehow not asked the voting question.

This caused big problems for the data, McDonald concluded: It means the Current Population Survey data counts many more respondents saying ""no I did not vote"" than actually didn’t vote; worse, the likelihood of obtaining these non-answers differs by racial group. For instance, in 2008, McDonald found, 21.9 percent of Massachusetts blacks were counted as having a ""non-answer"" on the voting question, compared to 13.5 percent of Massachusetts whites.

McDonald tried to rectify this problem by re-calculating the data using only the clear ""yes"" and ""no"" answers. When McDonald looked only at the clear responses, he found that the voting percentages in Massachusetts ended up at 80.2 percent for whites and 78.0 percent for blacks -- a statistically insignificant difference.

Even if you assume the Current Population Survey is a good source of data, Roberts has cherry-picked by citing Massachusetts

Let’s say for the moment that, despite the evidence cited above, the Current Population Survey is a valid source of data for Roberts’ purpose. There’s still a case to be made that he’s cherry-picked the data.

We analyzed the registration and voting numbers for 2008 and 2010 and found that Massachusetts was well out of the national mainstream in both years. This becomes clear when you compare Massachusetts to other large, relatively diverse northeastern states. Since most of its New England neighbors have black populations too small for the Census Bureau to provide data, we looked at four other states for comparison -- Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.

In 2010, when the white-black registration gap in Massachusetts was a whopping 36.5 percentage points, the average for the other four northeastern states was a much more modest 9.8 percentage points. Two years earlier, Massachusetts voting rates showed a 25.8 percentage point white-black gap, compared to just 6.3 percentage points for the other northeastern states.

It’s unclear why the Massachusetts data was so different, but if Roberts wanted to make his point by looking at the voting gaps in large, northeastern, ""liberal"" states, he could have chosen four that had relatively modest racial gaps. Instead, he chose the one outlier, Massachusetts, and that amounts to cherry-picking.

Where Roberts has a point

Roberts is on more solid ground with his discussion of Mississippi. Unlike the comparison of Massachusetts to its northeastern neighbors, Mississippi’s data in the Current Population Survey fits in closely with that of its neighbors in the deep south, which we’ll count as including Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina. And because the black population in these states is proportionally much larger than it is in Massachusetts, the margins of error for these states in the Current Population Survey are much less problematic.

In 2010, three of these deep south states had black registration rates higher than for whites, and four had black voting rates higher than for whites. The remaining deep south states were roughly at parity between the races. And this pattern was much the same in 2008.

Perhaps even more striking, this pattern was particular to the deep south. Black registration and voting rates were much less likely to exceed that of whites in other southern states -- Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.

So why has there been such strong black voting activity in states of the deep south? The government and supporters of the existing law say these high rates of participation stem from the Voting Rights Act’s preclearance provision itself, and they cite this as a major argument for keeping the law as is. Experts also suggest that the experience of living through the civil rights battles of the 1960s, or hearing about them from older relatives, has shaped a culture in which African-Americans in the deep south make a special point of voting.

Whatever the reason, the high rates of participation suggest that Roberts has a point: Voting rates in Mississippi, and the deep south generally, have improved over the years.

McDonald acknowledges this point -- even though he filed an amicus brief in the Shelby County case in favor of keeping the law as is.

The chief justice ""has a legitimate question that has to be asked and answered -- if you aggregate up the southern states, we know that turnout among African-Americans has gone up,"" McDonald said. ""He would have been much better served if he hadn’t cherry-picked. He deserved to have that question answered.""

Our ruling

Roberts said, ""Do you know which state has the worst ratio of white voter turnout to African-American voter turnout? Massachusetts. Do you know what has the best, where African-American turnout actually exceeds white turnout? Mississippi.""

For several reasons -- including unacceptably wide margins of error, strange year-to-year inconsistencies and problematic coding policies -- the survey data Roberts likely used to back up his point on Massachusetts is questionable. And even if this data source had been reliable for his purposes, Roberts’ decision to hold up Massachusetts as his primary example amounts to cherry picking, since its data diverges significantly from that of its regional neighbors.

However, Roberts makes a valid point when he notes that black voter turnout in Mississippi and other deep south states is high, and indeed often exceeds white turnout. So while Roberts is on shaky ground with Massachusetts, he’s on more solid turf when it comes to Mississippi. On balance, we’ll call it Half True.",/factchecks/2013/mar/05/john-roberts/was-chief-justice-john-roberts-right-about-voting-/

Rick Scott touts his education spending plan in third State of the State address
","
Gov. Rick ""Let’s get to work!"" Scott may be trying out a new slogan for his re-election campaign. More and more, his priorities are screaming ""Let’s get to class!""

Scott devoted much of his third State of the State address on Tuesday to education, singling out educators as special guests and asking lawmakers to stand in honor of their favorite teacher. Then he turned to another telltale sign of showing love: showing them money!

To polite applause, Scott reiterated his desire for the Legislature to give teachers a $2,500 across-the-board raise. He asked lawmakers to use his proposed education spending, which calls for an increase of $1.2 billion from last year, as their guide as they craft the state’s 2013-14 budget.

""Our total education investment of $10.7 billion in state funding for K-12 schools this year is the highest state funding level in Florida history,"" he said. ""This represents an increase of more than $400 in per student funding over the current fiscal year.""

Is he right? We’ll explain.

Scott’s statement is carefully crafted to specify that his budget proposal would provide the highest state funding level ever. Scott’s proposal would be the highest ever in terms of the state government’s actual dollar investment. In second place would be the 2007-08 budget signed by Gov. Charlie Crist, when the state allocated $9.71 billion.

But this doesn’t tell the entire story. Schools have a complex funding formula that involves a mix of local taxes, state dollars and, in recent years, federal stimulus money.

If Scott had his way, Florida’s total K-12 education budget would be $18.47 billion (the Legislature decides how to spend the state’s dough). If Scott gets the budget he wants, it would not be the highest spending on education ever. It would trail the 2007-08 budget signed by Gov. Charlie Crist by $280 million.

Education spending per student tells the same story. Yes, at $3,941, the state’s share of per-pupil spending in Scott’s budget would be the highest dollar investment.

But this view again neglects the complete picture of education spending. Total per-pupil funding proposed in Scott’s budget would be $6,700. This would be a $412 increase from the current year, but it lags behind per-pupil spending of $7,126 in the 2007-08 budget signed by Crist.

This is an important point: Six years ago, the state had fewer students but spent more money on each. Now we have 85,000 more students but spend less money on each one, according to Department of Education data.

We wondered if Scott’s proposal would hold up as the state’s biggest education investment when adjusted for inflation. Using a Consumer Price Index calculator from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we compared Scott’s proposal with state spending on education for the past 10 years.
   
We found state spending on education, when adjusted for inflation, would not be significantly different than it was from 2004 to 2007.

Our ruling 
Scott talked up the state’s share of education spending in his budget proposal as an historic investment, and it is in terms of actual dollars. But his overall recommendation for education spending remains short of what Florida students received before the economic crash, and about the same as it was from 2004 to 2007 when considering inflation.

Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria says tourists -- not taxpayers -- paid most of public cost for stadium
","
After a dismal 2012 season, Marlins baseball owner Jeffrey Loria slashed payroll and got rid of a handful of expensive players, including star shortstop Jose Reyes and pitcher Josh Johnson. Miami baseball fans cried ""foul!""

Loria’s moves revived debate about the lucrative public financing the Marlins won to build their stadium in 2009.  

On Feb. 24, Loria took out a full-page ""letter to our fans"" ad in the Miami Herald and other South Florida newspapers to defend his team’s deal, saying he wanted to review the ""facts.""

Loria’s letter was full of claims about the team’s roster, finances and the stadium deal -- with some reminders about the 2003 World Series sprinkled in.

Loria began with an admission that the Marlins’ performance on the field ""stunk"" and said he takes his share of the blame. But then Loria turned up the defense:

""Those who have attacked us are entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts. The majority of public funding came from hotel taxes, the burden of which is incurred by tourists who are visiting our city, NOT the resident taxpayers.....""

Sports writers and others have ripped apart Loria’s rant. (Yahoo! Sports rebutted Loria’s claims about everything from player trades to finances to the stadium’s design awards.)

Here at PolitiFact, we decided to put part of Loria’s claims about the stadium’s public financing to the Truth-O-Meter:  

""The majority of public funding came from hotel taxes, the burden of which is incurred by tourists who are visiting our city, NOT the resident taxpayers.""

Loria’s claim suggests that it was largely tourists -- not Miami-Dade taxpayers -- who are footing the bill for a stadium project. Is it those high-rolling tourists who are mostly paying by plunking down credit cards at luxurious hotels in South Beach and beyond? Do resident taxpayers bear minimal financial burden here for the stadium?

Marlins stadium deal

We turned to Miami Herald articles, stadium agreement documents and county officials to explain the deal.

After about a decade of failed attempts, the Marlins finally reached a deal in 2009 with Miami-Dade County and the city of Miami to replace the Orange Bowl stadium with a 37,000-seat retractable roof stadium in the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami.

The stadium cost about $515 million. Add in the parking complex, and the total rises to more than $600 million. 
The county, the city and the Marlins themselves all contributed to a fairly complicated deal. Here’s a big-picture accounting of what each agreed to put in:

 Miami-Dade County: In March 2009, commissioners voted for a plan that was largely funded by three different hotel bed taxes that added up to almost $300 million. (The county also pitched in other sources of money, including $50 million from an earlier voter-approved bond referendum that is being paid off with property taxes.) 
We should note that while tourists pay bed taxes, so does anyone else who stays in a hotel or motel for any reason. That includes business people visiting the area, friends and family who visit local residents, and locals who live in hotels or need a room for the night.

In total, the county borrowed about $409 million for the Marlins project, which includes debt service and the cost of issuing the bonds, a county spokeswoman told PolitiFact Florida.

The county manager wrote in a memo before the vote that the bed taxes ""cannot be used for general government funding purposes such as social services, public safety and public education."" But some bed tax dollars can be used for non-sports projects, such as museums and theaters.

The stadium was built on city-owned land later deeded over to the county, so the Marlins don’t have to pay property taxes.

City of Miami: In March 2009, the city of Miami pledged $94 million for the city-owned, 5,800-spot parking structures (the final cost later dropped). The city also committed $13 million from bed taxes toward stadium construction, and $12 million for other improvements.

Marlins: The team agreed to pay about $120 million toward stadium construction, and borrowed an additional $35 million from the county. The team pays rent, starting at about $2.3 million a year, plus 2 percent a year, to pay back that loan. The team is also paying $6 million of the county’s construction costs. The Marlins pays the city about $10 per parking space.

If all this weren’t complicated enough, in 2011, the Miami Herald reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission -- which was already reviewing the city of Miami’s finances -- had launched a separate probe of the stadium deal, to see if the city misled investors about the parking complex bonds.

Experts say that Loria is omitting some key points

We interviewed a few stadium financing experts who said that while Loria was correct that hotel bed taxes paid for a huge chunk of the cost, his claim obscured the fact that it was still public money, and it could have been spent on other projects to benefit local taxpayers.

""Simply put, Miami is going to get bed tax revenue regardless of whether Marlins park was built. So the implication that the city’s budget wasn’t affected by their decision to allocate their limited tax revenue to stadium construction is disingenuous,"" said Chris Lafakis, Moody’s senior economist who analyzes Florida, in an email to PolitiFact.

We also interviewed Adie Tomer and Siddharth Kulkarni, researchers for the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program. They have argued that the stadium will cost the county $2 billion over 40 years, when all the interest on the borrowing is included.

""Focusing on tourist taxes obscures the real essence of debate, which is what can Miami do with this revenue?"" Tomer said. ""$2 billion is an enormous long-term cost. Those revenues are lost now.""

Roger Noll, a Stanford economics professor, said that higher taxes on tourists take away money they would have spent in local businesses. ""Politically, taxing tourist-related activities (hotels, rental cars) is attractive, because some voters do not understand that a targeted tax hurts the business that is being taxed as well as its customers,"" he said.

Jonah Keri, a baseball writer for ESPN’s Grantland, said Loria’s letter is right on one point: The county should get some of the blame on the stadium deal.

""Loria is saying the real idiots here are the government who didn’t protect you from me,"" Keri said. ""That’s true. The thing about Loria is, I don’t think he is that much worse than any other owner. It really is the case that local officials are the ones who bungled this. Any capitalist is going to do this.""

In an interview with PolitiFact, Marlins president David Samson defended Loria’s claim, noting that bed taxes can’t fund general government functions.

""It can’t go to police officers, firefighters, nurses, doctors, ambulance drivers. ... It cannot be used to build park shelters for the homeless, as an example.""

Our ruling

In response to renewed criticism about the 2009 Marlins stadium financing deal, Loria said ""The majority of public funding came from hotel taxes, the burden of which is incurred by tourists who are visiting our city, NOT the resident taxpayers.""

Loria is borrowing from politicians’ playbooks here: He cherry-picked a fact that puts the situation in the best light while omitting a thorough explanation. On the surface, he is correct: Much of the public funding for the stadium came from hotel bed taxes largely (though not entirely) paid for by tourists.

But these are still tax revenues that belong to the taxpayer, and if it didn’t go to the Marlins, it would have gone to some other public purpose to benefit those taxpayers. He also ignores that the county will be paying off that debt for decades. His implication that locals can shrug their shoulders at that public cost, and dismiss it as coming from the wallets of out of town tourists, is disingenuous.

"['Georgia', 'Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'Paul  Howard']","
Numbers right about sentencing, but cause is elusive
","
Has being tough on crime gone too far, or are strict sentences for criminals the key to reducing crime?

Two decades ago, Georgia revised its sentencing guidelines and established mandatory sentences for a range of serious crimes. Those sentencing laws have led to longer sentences and high prison populations, along with exploding taxpayer costs. Efforts are currently under way to dial back the laws and give the courts some flexibility on mandatory minimum sentences.

But some officials, such as Paul Howard, the district attorney for Fulton County, which includes the city of Atlanta, want to keep the strict sentencing rules and touts their benefits.

""In Atlanta, since 1994 when the ‘Seven Deadly Sins’ took effect, the violent crime rate has dropped 62 percent,"" Howard said last month in an article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Crime numbers are always a wily topic, and the data can be manipulated in various ways to elicit a desired response. PolitiFact Georgia decided to see whether Howard’s claim was on target.

The DA’s support of the mandatory minimums is based on his criticism of sentencing disparities. ""Black defendants are at least 30 percent more likely to be in prison for the same crime,"" Howard said in the AJC article. ""Whenever judges are allowed to sentence at their discretion, the disparity increases.""

One of the best ways to avoid racial disparities is to make the sentences the same, he said.

Under then-Gov. Zell Miller, sentencing revisions were approved that implemented sentences of 10 years with no parole for committing one of the ""seven deadly sins,"" which included rape, armed robbery, kidnapping, aggravated child molestation, aggravated sodomy and aggravated sexual battery. A second conviction mandates a life sentence without parole. 

Howard provided PolitiFact Georgia with two charts showing Atlanta’s crime rate from 1994 to 2010. The data was derived from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports, according to Howard’s office.

The FBI data show that the category of violent crime includes four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes are defined as those offenses that involve force or threat of force.

The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports, published annually, are compiled from data voluntarily provided by police departments. About 92 percent of U.S. police departments report their data, said James Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University. 

For Atlanta, the FBI data showed:

1994: population, 411,204    violent crimes: 14,684        violent crime rate: 3,571
2010: population,420,003    violent crimes: 5,749        violent crime rate: 1,368.8

With slight rounding, the decrease in the crime rate - the number of incidents per every 100,000 residents -- was 62 percent. We ran the FBI numbers for an additional year and found that through 2011, the decrease in the violent crime rate was slightly less, at about 60 percent. 

In the past decade, Atlanta’s population estimates have differed from those issued by the U.S. Census Bureau, which revised the city’s population downward. Howard uses the higher population figures for from 2001 to 2009. But his claim involves the crime rate between two specific years, 1994 and 2010, and his population figures match those census figures used by the FBI. The difference has no impact on his claim. Using the revised lower population for 2009, for example, would have changed the decrease in the violent crime rate to 57 percent.

Criminology experts we talked to agreed that the portion of Howard’s statement about the decreased crime rate was true, but that the question lies with causality.

""It’s certainly possible that the increase in sentencing has played a role, but you can’t without a lot of confidence say that that is the full reason why crime rates have changed,"" said Douglas Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University who has extensively studied the issue. Berman opposes mandatory sentencing.

And it’s also notable that violent crime rates dropped not just in Atlanta, but in other places across the country, including places without mandatory sentencing, said Robert Friedmann, a professor emeritus of criminal justice at Georgia State University. 

GBI crime data show that from 1994 to 2010 the crime rate for violent crimes decreased in the state by 36.7 percent. And through 2011 the rate decreased 40.5 percent.

Nationwide, violent and property crimes decreased for the fifth straight year, according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report for 2011. In 2010, the number of violent crimes in the country dropped to the lowest rate in nearly 40 years.

So does Howard prove his case?

The Fulton district attorney supports strict mandatory minimum sentencing. One of his arguments is the notable 62 percent decrease in violent crimes in the two decades since the sentences have been in place. 

FBI data support his claim. The violent crime rate from 1994 to 2010 did indeed drop 62 percent; and through 2011, the decrease in the violent crime rate was about 60 percent. On just the numbers, Howard is correct. But criminology and law experts say it is almost impossible to tie the decrease directly to this one issue of mandatory minimum sentencing.

Howard’s numbers are accurate, but his statement needs additional information. We rated his statement Mostly True.

House Speaker John Boehner says Obama, Democrats have no plan to replace sequester
","
With no last-minute deal to avoid sequestration, the sweeping federal spending cuts have begun to take effect, and politicians have taken to the airwaves to explain where they stand.

House Speaker John Boehner appeared on Meet the Press on March 3, 2013, and told host David Gregory he and his fellow Republicans have done all they can to break the stalemate over deficit reduction. It’s now up to President Barack Obama and the Democrats, Boehner said.

""We've known about this for 16 months. And yet even today, there's no plan from Senate Democrats or the White House to replace the sequester,"" he said. ""And over the last 10 months, House Republicans have acted twice to replace the sequester.""

No plan? That didn’t sound quite right.

The White House plan

It didn't take us long to find the White House plan. We found it on the White House home page by clicking the prominent button that says ""SEE THE PLAN."" It leads to a page titled ""A Balanced Plan to Avert the Sequester and Reduce the Deficit.""

The plan cites deficit reduction of the past two years, which has included a $600 billion tax hike on wealthy households and $1.4 trillion in discretionary spending cuts. Going forward, Obama proposes $200 billion in reduced defense spending, new efficiencies in health care that would save another $400 billion, eliminating some agriculture subsidies and reforming the postal service, among other proposals. On the revenue side, the plan calls for closing tax loopholes and limiting deductions to 28 percent for the wealthiest Americans.

The White House says the new deficit reductions total $1.3 trillion on top of what’s already been enacted.

Senate Democrats’ plan

On Feb. 26, Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski introduced the American Family Economic Protection Act of 2013, which would cancel the $85.3 billion sequester and replace it over several years with a mix of spending cuts and tax increases.

The bill proposes to cut $27.5 billion from the defense budget and another $27.5 billion from agriculture funding. It would raise $55 billion in new revenue by implementing the ""Buffett Rule"" (which sets a minimum 30 percent tax rate on income above $1 million) and ending tax deductions for oil companies.

On Feb. 28, the Senate voted on a motion to cut off debate, which would have brought the bill up for a full vote, but the motion failed 51-49 on a largely partisan vote (60 votes were needed to end debate).

The explanation

With both of those ""plans"" easily found in official records and news reports, we asked Boehner’s spokesman Brendan Buck how the speaker could claim that none exists.

""A plan must demonstrate it has the ability to pass a chamber of Congress to be worth anything. We’ve twice passed a plan. We’re still waiting for the Senate to pass something, anything,"" Buck told PolitiFact in an email.

He’s right that sequester replacement plans have twice passed the House, most recently in December 2012 by the previous Congress. The House plan would replace the defense cuts under sequestration, and find savings in other programs, including food stamps, a public health fund that’s part of Obamacare and other savings totalling $1.4 trillion.

It includes no new revenue, which is the primary point of disagreement with Obama and Democrats.

But we find his definition of the word ""plan"" to be ridiculously narrow. Congress often considers ""plans"" that don't pass either chamber. For example, Boehner was unable to muster the votes to pass his ""Plan B"" for the fiscal cliff, which Buck himself referred to as ""a back-up plan to ensure taxes don't rise on American families.""

Our ruling

Boehner said that the White House and Democrats in the Senate have no plan to replace the sequester.

He’s wrong on both counts. Obama has a proposal for replacing sequestration cuts with a mix of tax increases and spending cuts. And Senate Democrats have filed a sequester-replacement bill taking a similar approach.

Two-thirds collecting unemployment don't have to look for jobs, Scott Walker says
","
When Gov. Scott Walker preached about the need to reform government assistance programs on Feb. 13, 2013, his congregation was a ""business day"" gathering in Madison. 
But one could imagine the minister's son giving the same speech at a town hall gathering in Iowa, stumping for the 2016 presidential nomination -- a possibility raised a number of times since the 2012 presidential election. 
In his 37-minute ""dependence to independence""presentation, which was accompanied by a slide show, Walker rejected a federal proposal to expand Medicaid and called for requiring able-bodied, childless adults who receive food stamps to get job training. 
Then the Republican governor turned to unemployment benefits. 
People receiving unemployment checks should be required to look for a job four times a week instead of two, Walker said, adding ""we want to make sure you’re out hustling each and every week as much as reasonably as possible to go out and find that job. We’re going to give you the skills and the backing and the opportunity to do that, but you’ve got to work to make that happen as well. I don’t think that’s an unrealistic expectation."" 
Although Walker didn’t state it in his speech, he claimed in one of his slides that two-thirds of unemployment insurance recipients in Wisconsin ""are not required to search for work due to current work search exemptions."" 
That seems like a big number. Is he right? Is there more to the story? 
Unemployment picture 
Employment has been a contentious issue since Walker took office in January 2011. As our Walk-O-Meter shows, the governor is far off the pace for meeting his signature campaign promise of creating 250,000 private-sector jobs during his four-year term. At the same time, he emphasizes that the state's unemployment rate has been lower than the national rate and has generally declined during his tenure. 
In January 2013, Walker proposed tightening the standards for receiving jobless benefits, a move that would have to be approved by the Legislature. 
Wisconsinites seeking unemployment benefits must file a claim each week they are out of work. Depending on what their previous wages were, their unemployment benefits are between $54 and $363 per week. 
When filing the weekly claims, the recipients are asked a number of questions, including: 
Were you able to work full-time and available for full-time work? 
and 
Did you contact at least two employers during the week to try to find work? 
Recipients could lose their benefits if they don’t contact at least two employers ""who hire people with your skills or might have other work you can do."" 
However, state regulations waive the work search requirement under a number of circumstances. 
According to Walker’s Department of Workforce Development: 
""You may be told that you do not have to look for work if you are definitely returning to full-time work for a recent employer or if you are a member (in good standing) of a trade union that operates a hiring hall or referral system and has signed an agreement with the department. In some cases, you will not have to look for work if you are working part-time."" 
Walker’s evidence 
John Dipko, a spokesman for the Department of Workforce Development, told us that Walker’s claim is based on calculations by the department. 
The department estimated that 60,167 people filed an initial claim for unemployment benefits in January 2013 and were paid benefits. In other words, they were filing for the first time since becoming unemployed; that’s when the determination is made on whether they must look for work. 
Two-thirds of those people -- 40,119 -- were not required to look for work, the department determined. 
We asked for figures covering a longer period of time and were given statistics indicating that in 2012, an even larger proportion of unemployment compensation recipients -- 68 percent -- were not required to work. 
We ran the numbers by Maurice Emsellem, policy co-director of the National Employment Law Project, which says it promotes ""help unemployed workers regain their economic footing through improved benefits and services."" He didn’t quarrel with the accuracy of the claim that two-thirds of the recipients don’t have to look for work. 
But Emsellem said it would be counterproductive, both for employers and employees, to require laid-off employees to look for new jobs if they are likely to soon return to their old job, or similar work. Those people are not likely to find better jobs -- or temporary ones -- simply by making ""cold calls"" to other employers, he said. 
Getting back to the most recent figures that Walker relied on, for January 2013, here’s a breakdown from the Department of Workforce Development of the 40,119 people who filed new claims for unemployment insurance who were not required to look for work: 
Our rating 
Walker said two-thirds of Wisconsinites receiving unemployment checks ""are not required to search for work due to current work search exemptions."" 
The statement is accurate, but needs additional information -- namely that the vast majority of unemployment insurance recipients who aren’t required to look for work are expected to be working again relatively soon, many at the same jobs they were laid off from.

"['New Hampshire', 'Veterans', 'Carol Shea-Porter']","
U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter claims NH is only state without full service VA hospital
","
U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, D-N.H. has reinvigorated efforts to increase veterans’ access to health care in the Granite State -- and has repeated a familiar claim in the process.

In a press release issued in January, she reintroduced the Veterans Health Equity Act, which requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure every state has a full-service veterans  hospital, or similar services through contracts with state hospitals.

""New Hampshire is currently the only state in the nation that does not have a full-service veterans hospital or equivalent access,"" Shea-Porter said in a press release Jan. 16.

New Hampshire residents, and veterans, have heard this several times in recent years. U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster, D-NH mouthed the same claim in January as a cosponsor to Shea-Porter’s bill. And U.S. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. and Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H. have each shared the same point before in support of similar legislation.

But to determine what is a ""full-service"" veterans hospital and whether New Hampshire really is the only state without one, we decided to consult our Truth-o-Meter.

First, we contacted Shea-Porter’s staff for some answers.

They said three states in the country do not have a full-service VA hospital: Hawaii, Alaska and New Hampshire.

""Alaska and Hawaii both have Tricare military hospitals,"" which veterans can access, said Shea-Porter’s chief of staff, Naomi Andrews, in an email. ""New Hampshire alone has no VA or Tricare full service hospital.""

Bringing more veteran’s health care to the Granite State has been a bipartisan issue for about a decade.

Andrews also pointed to statements by Shaheen and former U.S. Rep Charlie Bass, R-N.H., saying the same thing to validate the claim.

Ever since New Hampshire’s VA Medical Center in Manchester was downsized more than 10 years ago due to financial reasons, several members of New Hampshire’s congressional delegation have offered bills similar to Shea-Porter’s.

In 2009, Shaheen filed similar legislation with her own Veterans Health Equity Act in the Senate as Shea-Porter authored the companion bill in the House. Neither bill went anywhere during the 111th Congress and each drew just one co-sponsor (Sen. Judd Gregg in the Senate; Rep. Paul Hodes in the House), never emerging from their respective committees.

In 2011, Shaheen and Ayotte introduced the Veterans Health Equity Act of 2011, which then-U.S. Reps. Bass and Frank Guinta, R-NH, co-sponsored, and now it has been reintroduced in 2013.

Manchester VAMC lost its ""full-service"" designation after an assessment by the U.S. Office of the Inspector General in 2000. At the time, it was a 28-bed primary and secondary care facility that employed roughly 500 people, operated on a $41.8 million budget and was providing care to more than 15,000 veterans.

Today, the Manchester’s VA Medical Center provides urgent care, primary care, ambulatory surgery, specialty clinics, mental health, hospital based home care, community acute care and long term care services to veterans, according to its website.

Since then, New Hampshire veterans had to travel to Boston or White River Junction, Vt., for emergency care they used to be able to get closer to home.

In 2009, VA officials opted to outsource some medical services by contracting with Concord Hospital and other care providers, rather than open a VA hospital in Manchester, calling Concord Hospital a ""centrally located regional medical center that offers traditional acute care services in 42 medical specialties.""It also upgraded mental health facilities at the VAMC Manchester.

A press release on the partnership said it allowed the VA to provide coordinated care and services ""equivalent to a general medical and surgical hospital locally within New Hampshire.""

So does this constitute a full-service equivalent contrary to Shea-Porter’s assertion?

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs says there is no industry-wide definition of a ""full-service"" hospital; even ""highly tertiary"" private sector hospitals don’t provide all health services.

In the veterans health administration, a medical center, by policy definition, is a site that offers acute inpatient services and at least one additional service such as outpatient care, long-term care or mental health care, said Sue Hopkins, a public affairs officer with the VA’s regional office.

By that measure, New Hampshire and Alaska are the only states that don’t have a true VA medical center, even though the New Hampshire facility uses ""medical center"" in its name, Hopkins said.

Hawaii, which provides inpatient acute and inpatient psychiatric care for veterans, would be considered a VA medical center, Hopkins said. But veterans’ medical and surgical care is obtained through agreements with Tripler Army Medical Center whose staff are ""closely integrated with VA clinicians.""

Alaska does not have a VA medical center, but has agreements for acute medical and surgical care at neighboring facilities, most of which is provided at the Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson Hospital, adjacent to a VA outpatient clinic, Hopkins said.

In New Hampshire, veterans can get non-emergency care at the Manchester VA Medical Center’s urgent care facility, Hopkins said. Those who need an acute inpatient care stay for conditions like pneumonia, unstable angia, or appendicitis are typically sent to Concord Hospital or in more ‘emergent situations,"" Elliott Hospital or Catholic Medical Center, Hopkins said.

In a medical emergency, veterans can go to the nearest healthcare facility that will provide the care needed, she added. The VA will pay for emergency care in non-VA facilities for certain service-disabled veterans or as payer of last resort under other conditions.

The VA measures access by distance, not state boundaries, Hopkins said. New Hampshire veterans can access VA acute inpatient care outside the state, via: 
White River Junction, Vt. (0.3 miles from the state border) 
Bedford, Mass. (15 miles from the state border) 
Boston, Mass. (33 miles from the state border to West Roxbury Campus of the VA Boston Healthcare System) 
Togus, Maine (78 miles from the state border) 

In other larger states that have full service hospitals, veterans have to travel farther than veterans in New Hampshire for similar care.

In South Texas, for example,  U.S. Sen. John Cornyn is pushing a bill to add inpatient health care and an emergency room to a new veterans medical facility in Harlingen to serve the thousands of rural Texas veterans who have to travel more than six hours to get the care they need in San Antonio.

Even in New Jersey, some veterans who need specific procedures have to spend more than four hours in a car or bus to visit VA facilities in East Orange, Philadelphia or Wilmington, Del., according to published reports.

In New Hampshire, veterans in need of complex, specialized services for conditions like hip replacements, neurosurgery, or a bypass are typically sent to the VA Boston Healthcare System.

According to statistics cited by The Boston Globe in 2011, one quarter of New Hampshire veterans  -- 2,741 cases -- in need of acute care for issues such as heart failure, pneumonia and others were sent out of state.

""While VA is working to keep more New Hampshire veterans in the state for their medical care whenever possible, admission to inpatient care is based on medical need and the clinical judgment of the VA provider,"" Hopkins said.

Our ruling

Shea-Porter wasn’t completely right to say New Hampshire is the only state without a ""full-service"" veterans hospital.The VA doesn’t use the definition ""full service."" Instead it uses the definition of a medical center, and Alaska doesn’t have one either, even though it does offer many needed medical services to veterans on base.

As for ""equivalent access,"" most New Hampshire veterans can access medical centers that will provide the services they need through contracts with non-VA, in-state hospitals, but in some cases, veterans in need of specialized services are sent to Boston. Even when New Hampshire veterans are sent out of state, they don’t have to travel as far as some veterans in larger states, like Texas.

Shea Porter’s statement leaves out some important details. We give her a Half True.
