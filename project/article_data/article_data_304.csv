Union to mayor: A rescue captain worked 96 hours straight
","In early November, a Providence fire captain, Zachariah Kenyon, clocked 96 hours in a row — the equivalent of two 48-hour work weeks. The 45-year-old’s marathon tour of duty follows much argument over the restructuring of the firefighters’ shift schedule, ordered in August by Mayor Jorge O. Elorza. Instead of working 42 hours per week in four shifts firefighters are now working in three shifts of 48 hours every six days, or an average of 56 hours per week. One vocal critic of the change, Paul A. Doughty, president of the firefighters’ union, went on Twitter to address the mayor: ""...still think your plan is safe? Rescue Captain Kenyon just worked 96 hours straight. 96 hours. Your plan is a disaster!!!"" So a firefighter worked 96 hours straight? We wondered if that really happened. And if so, how? We reached out to Public Safety Commissioner Steven M. Pare, Doughty and Kenyon, who also has a leadership position in the union, serving on its board and representing about 80 fire employees in special services divisions. Of course, we were interested in Kenyon’s story, but initially we just wanted to see the records. Kenyon gave us a personnel record that shows he reported to duty on the morning of Friday, Nov. 6, around 8 a.m. and he remained on duty for a 96-hour period that ended Tuesday, Nov. 10, around 8 a.m. The personnel record also shows that Kenyon had originally been scheduled to work two 10-hour shifts, one on Friday and another on Saturday followed by two 14-hour overnight shifts on Sunday into Monday and Monday into Tuesday. This adds up to 48 hours on duty over 5 days. Kenyon ended up on duty for each of the four scheduled shifts plus all hours in between, according to the record. The captain accepted one overtime shift and he was ordered to stand duty for the other three shifts. This is how he explained how he came to be on duty for 96 hours and Pare confirmed it. Ninety-six hours seems like a very long time for someone with public safety responsibilities to be on the clock. For Doughty and other firefighters, ""working"" and being on duty are the same thing. However, Providence firefighters, unlike police officers, can often climb into bed between emergencies during their shifts. So Kenyon was not on his feet like a construction worker or an emergency room nurse for 96 straight hours. It’s also clear that he got paid for 96 hours of work. Without knowing how much Kenyon slept, it seemed reasonable for Doughty to ask the mayor if this was safe. Pare asserts that the captain had ample opportunity to get the rest necessary to perform effectively in emergency situations and Kenyon could have asked to go home if he felt he hadn’t had enough sleep to operate safely. Kenyon, who doesn’t remember how much sleep he had during the 96 hours, says he was able to operate safely. ""I feel I’m pretty capable,"" he says.   Doughty disagrees, suggesting that sleep deprivation erodes a person’s ability to make good judgments about his or her capabilities. It’s against department policy for firefighters to sleep past 7 a.m., he says, and the noise at fire headquarters, with alarms sounding, is another issue. ""It’s not good sleep,"" Doughty says. ""It’s not rehabilitative sleep."" We looked at public safety records, including dispatch logs, and found that Kenyon and those who also worked on Rescue 4 handled 67 emergency calls over the course of 96 hours. The crew transported 43 patients to hospitals and 15 calls were cancelled en route, according to the records we reviewed, which are not clear on what happened with the other nine calls. Kenyon, who says he doesn’t need as much sleep as others,  recalls sleeping the last seven hours of his 96-hours on duty, but he says he doesn’t remember when he slept during the first 89 hours. Records that Pare provided to PolitiFact indicate there were several other periods within that 89-hour span when Kenyon was not busy with calls and had some opportunity for sleep. The records show three periods of about four hours during the morning hours of Saturday, Nov. 7, Sunday Nov. 8, and Monday Nov. 9. Our ruling No one disputes that Kenyon was on duty for 96 straight hours, Kenyon had some opportunity for sleep and it’s likely he did.  But he doesn’t remember when that was, or for how long. He only recalls sleeping during the last 7 of the 96 hours The question that Doughty Tweeted: ""@Jorge_Elorza still think your plan is safe?"" was fair to ask, even if the public was not at risk as both Pare and the captain assert. (Further, Pare disputes Doughty’s charge that the plan is a ""disaster!!!"") But without clarification, Doughty’s suggestion that Kenyon ""worked 96 hours straight"" could leave the impression that Kenyon never slept. He did sleep. To be more accurate, Doughty could have said that Kenyon had been ""on duty"" for 96 hours. The job, by its nature,  involves a mixture of sleep and work. For this reason, we rate Doughty’s claim Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2015/nov/22/paul-doughty/union-mayor-rescue-captain-worked-96-hours-straigh/

Fiorina says 'vast majority' of Syrian refugees are able bodied young men
","Carly Fiorina, in trying to position herself as ""most qualified leader in foreign policy"" among the Republican candidates for president, reiterated her September stand against admitting Syrian refugees to come to the United States. At a meeting with the New Hampshire Federation of Republican Women in Concord, N.H., on Nov. 17 -- following the terrorist attacks in Paris -- Fiorina questioned the demographics of those fleeing. The photos of mothers and their children provoke sympathy, she said, but they don’t show ""the truth."" ""The vast majority of these refugees are young, able-bodied men looking for work,"" she said at the event, which was covered by the Concord Monitor. In Concord, she didn’t specifically say Syrian refugees, but the surrounding discussion was specific to Syria. A day later, she repeated the claim on talk radio during an interview with host Mike Gallagher and specified that ""the vast majority of refugees leaving Syria are able-bodied young men."" That sounded like a job for PolitiFact. United Nations data Previously, PolitiFact has examined claims about Syrian refugees. In October, Donald Trump said ""there aren't that many women; there aren't that many children"" among Syrian refugees. We ranked that statement False. The United Nations keeps track of more than 4 million registered Syrian refugees, with an online database that includes specific demographic data. Let’s start by leaving out the other qualifiers — young and able-bodied — and look at whether the ""vast majority"" of refugees are men. We need not split hairs on what constitutes a ""vast majority"" here, since the gender breakdown is pretty evenly split; in hard numbers, the majority of refugees is actually female. Further, to look at only the male refugees – which amount to 49.7 percent of the total – less than half of that population is age 18 or older. Men ages 18 to 59 comprise about 22 percent of all Syrian refugees. Contrary to Fiorina’s statement, most refugees overall are children age 17 or younger. Resettlement Geoffrey Mock, a Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, explained the situation of Syrian refugees to PolitiFact for the similar fact-check of Trump. He said the sort of refugees Fiorina was talking about – young, able-bodied men – would be given a low priority for settling in the United States. President Obama recommended in September that the country take at least 10,000 refugees in the next fiscal year. The United Nations recommended in April that the U.S. and other industrialized countries shelter 130,000 Syrian refugees over the following two years. ""The priorities go to torture survivors, people with serious medical conditions, children and teens on their own, and women and children at risk,"" Mock told PolitiFact. Selected refugees undergo screening by state agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security. The process can take years. Our ruling Fiorina said the ""vast majority of (Syrian) refugees are young, able-bodied men looking for work."" She repeated the essence of a claim that wasn’t accurate a month earlier and isn’t accurate today. A slight majority of Syrian refugees are female, and men age 18 to 59 comprise about 22 percent of all Syrian refugees. We rate Fiorina’s claim False.",/factchecks/2015/nov/20/carly-fiorina/fiorina-says-vast-majority-syrian-refugees-are-abl/
"['Immigration', 'Texas', ""Martin O'Malley""]","
Gov. Martin O'Malley says immigration reform will boost workers' paychecks
","While presidential candidate and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley was in Austin on a campaign stop, he said immigration reform would pay off for all Americans through their paychecks. In a Nov. 12, 2015 interview on ""Overheard with Evan Smith,"" O’Malley discussed President Barack Obama’s executive order on immigration, and whether he would take similar action. O’Malley told Smith he believes the country needs immigration reform because it’s ""something important for the economy of the United States."" ""If we pass immigration reform, it will make wages go up on average $250 for the average household,"" he elaborated. ""Why? Because you’re getting 11 million people in many times off-the-books jobs onto the open economy of the United States of America."" The number of undocumented immigrants in the United States has hovered around 11 million since 2009, according to a July 2015 report from the Pew Research Center, evaluating data through 2014. Undocumented immigrants make up 5.1 percent of the U.S. labor force, Pew reported in July 2015. We don’t and can’t check predictions. Still, we wondered whether it was true, based on research, that immigration reform could mean $250 more for the average American household, as O’Malley said. Long-term figure O’Malley’s campaign press secretary, Haley Morris, said the governor got the $250 figure from a July 2013 White House report, published in support of a 2013 Senate immigration reform bill. That report, ""The Economic Benefits of Fixing Our Broken Immigration System,"" states that ""in the long run, the Senate bill raises wages for all groups of workers by boosting productivity."" The White House’s conclusion relies on the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s analysis of the economic impact of that bill, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act.   The $250 figure O’Malley cites is certainly long term. It refers to a rise in wages between 2013 and 2033 – and doesn’t otherwise estimate year-by-year changes. As the White House report breaks it down: ""CBO estimates that real wages will be 0.5 percent higher in 2033 than projected under current law. In today’s terms, that would be equivalent to an additional $250 of income for the median American household."" Wages would increase partly because immigration reform would lead to a higher rate of return on capital throughout the next two decades. A web search led us to George Borjas, a labor economist specializing in immigration issues at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. He questioned the assumptions behind the CBO’s calculation. To reach its conclusion about immigration reform’s effect on wages, the CBO report uses a ""positivity effect,"" a name for the effect of a correlation between state GDP and immigration. However, Borjas says, the relationship between higher state GDP and immigration could be correlation, not causation, which would put the $250 figure into question. Borjas, who reviewed the report at our request, said: ""Maybe immigrants are smart enough to realize they should settle in states with high productivity."" Other research released when the bill in question was in the Senate in 2013 supported the CBO’s analysis. An August 2013 article from the Brookings Institution compared the bill’s potential effects to immigration’s historical impact on the economy, finding that ""on average, previous waves of immigrants tended to boost American wages."" On the other hand, neither analysis said American households would see an immediate or steady spike in income. Lower wages in the short term Even if the long-term $250 figure holds true, the CBO concluded that comprehensive immigration reform actually would lead to lower average wages in the short-term before boosting overall productivity. In the first decade, according to its analysis, average wages would decrease by 0.1 percent. By the CBO's estimates, average wages would be slightly lower than under current law through 2024 before they rise above current wages the following decade. Comprehensive immigration reform also would lead to a temporary imbalance in the labor market, causing slightly higher unemployment through 2020, when the labor market would adjust. Wages would be lower at first, the CBO says, because growth of the workforce would outpace capital available. In addition, new workers would be less skilled and have lower wages, affecting average wages for the entire workforce. Brookings pointed out that wage decreases would be larger for workers with some high school or only a high school diploma, who would be more likely to compete with new workers, compared to college graduates.  Other considerations Immigration reform’s effects on the economy extend beyond immediate and long-term effects on average wages. As Gregory Wright, an assistant professor of economics at University of California-Merced who studies international trade and migration, points out, ""Immigrants are very entrepreneurial relative to the native population, and high-skill immigrants tend to generate a disproportionate number of patents and are more innovative by other measures."" In another section of its report, the CBO specifies that immigrants receive patents at twice the rate of the native-born U.S. population. Additionally, Wright says, immigration reform would create work through ""demand-side channels."" ""Moving undocumented workers into the open would allow them to raise their own standard of living and they would subsequently demand more housing, education and generally more of all goods and services, which generates work for others,"" Wright said. Increasing the sheer number of people in the workforce raises output and consumption, or GDP, Wright says. The CBO estimated that immigration reform would raise real GDP by 3.3 percent in 2023 and by 5.4 percent in 2033. Immigrants entering the official workforce will then pay taxes, supporting the aging U.S. population, Wright added. Our ruling O’Malley’s claim that immigration reform would ""make wages go up on average $250 for the average household"" would not be accurate anytime soon. The $250 in question is a calculation based on mathematical assumptions -- assumptions that some question -- that refers to a long-term result over two decades. In the near term, the same analysis projects wages would dip slightly. O’Malley’s statement contains an element of truth, but the wage-raising conclusion is misleading. We rate it Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Greg Abbott claims Syrians 'caught' at Mexico border, a reminder of needed vigilance
","Gov. Greg Abbott, at the forefront of a push-back by more than half the nation's governors against the U.S. admitting Syrian refugees, declared that fresh apprehensions at the Texas-Mexico border illuminate his concerns. In a Nov. 18, 2015, Twitter post, the Texas Republican said: ""THIS is why Texas is vigilant about Syrian refugees."" His tweet pointed to a headline on a story posted that night by the conservative Breitbart.com: ""8 Syrians caught at Texas border in Laredo."" Refugees from Syria -- where four years of civil war has displaced millions of people, according to the United Nations -- have been a hot topic of late. On Nov. 16, 2015, Abbott was among what proved to be 31 of the nation's governors declaring refusals to admit Syrian refugees to their states, for fear militants would mix in. That followed unsubstantiated reports that Syrians were involved in the Paris massacre that killed more than 130 people in Paris Nov. 13, 2015. Such reports were based on the discovery of a Syrian passport near the body of an attacker, which The Washington Post reported Nov. 17, 2015 was not authentic. Worth noting too, Republican officials in Texas have occasionally expressed concern that ISIS -- the terrorist militia waging war in Syria and Iraq -- could send members over the Texas border to attack the United States. When we checked, those fears were based on false assertions, like that ISIS was operating a base in Mexico, Border Patrol caught ISIS members, or that Muslim prayer rugs were found on the Texas border. But the morning after Abbott weighed in, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Mike McCaul of Texas, took to TV to say there was no need for worry. Still, we wondered: Could it be that Syrian insurgents were snagged at the Rio Grande? Abbott’s source Abbott spokesman John Wittman declined to comment when asked about how the governor reached his conclusion or if the governor believed the described Syrians posed a security threat. Wittman also didn’t say if Abbott had relied on sources aside from the Breitbart story he noted in his tweet. Breitbart’s story, headlined ""Exclusive--Confirmed: 8 Syrians caught at Texas border in Laredo,"" cited two individuals described as federal agents but not identified in the story who reportedly advised that ""eight Syrian illegal aliens attempted to enter Texas from Mexico in the Laredo sector"" on Monday, Nov. 16, 2015, two days before Abbott posted his tweet.   The story further quoted Hector Garza, a Border Patrol agent and president of a South Texas chapter of the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing Border Patrol personnel. According to the post, Garza said agents in the Laredo area were ""concerned"" because they had ""heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents,"" although he also said he couldn’t confirm that Syrians had lately been apprehended. By email Nov. 20, 2015, Garza told us he couldn't comment because he was on patrol. In an email, Brandon Darby, editor of Breitbart Texas and the lead reporter on the story, said his sources used the word ""caught"" because they said the Syrians ""only acknowledged being Syrian after they were called out."" Darby also noted that ""caught"" has a ""plethora of acceptable definitions,"" which he supplied via email, though he declined to specify which he had intended to convey. Federal narrative We asked key federal agencies for their takes on the reported detentions. In an emailed statement responding to our query, the Department of Homeland Security, the umbrella agency for Border Patrol, said two Syrian families presented themselves at the Laredo port of entry and were taken into custody for further processing. ""Please emphasize that they PRESENTED themselves,"" the statement said. We also touched base with the Texas Department of Public Safety, which previously doused speculation about terrorists crossing the border in October 2014. Spokesman Tom Vinger, by email, referred us to the Border Patrol. Meantime, Rick Pauza, a Border Patrol spokesman at the Laredo point of entry, said by phone the eight Syrians described in the Breitbart report ""identified themselves truthfully"" and did not evade agents.   Darby, informed of this response, told us by email, ""CBP, unfortunately, has a history of being deceptive with the public."" He also pointed out a June 2014 article he authored for Breitbart titled ""Customs and Border Protection agency caught lying to public."" The morning after Abbott posted his tweet, McCaul discussed reports of the Syrians in Laredo on MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell Reports. ""It was a Syrian refugee family that went to the Laredo port of entry in my state and basically turned themselves in for political asylum,"" McCaul said, meaning they were seeking shelter from imminent harm in their home country. ""They were not infiltrating to conduct terrorist operations."" Appropriate border crossing procedures If Syrians were looking for asylum, was walking to the border a reasonable way to do it? Mana Yegani, a Houston immigration lawyer, told us by phone that one way of seeking asylum is to appear at a port of entry. ""This is very common,"" Yegani said. ""That’s the way you seek refuge. You cross the border and walk to a border patrol agent."" Typically, she said, after asylum-seekers present themselves to agents, they are sent to detention centers and interviewed by federal asylum officers, who evaluate their cases for admittance to the United States. The process usually takes three to six months, she said. The website for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services directs asylum seekers on how to proceed. ""STEP ONE: Arrive in the U.S.,"" it says. We asked Homeland Security if any Syrians had sought asylum in the U.S. before. A spokesperson pointed us to fiscal year 2013 data--the most recent available--which showed that 811 Syrians were granted asylum during that period, up from 364 in 2012 and 60 in 2011, the year the Syrian civil war began.     In all, 3.2 percent of the 25,199 asylum-seekers welcomed by the United States were Syrian in 2013. It’s rare for a Syrian to cross the border lacking required papers, other statistics suggest. According to a September 2014 report by Homeland Security, 72 of the 662,483 ""aliens apprehended"" by the government in the fiscal year through September 2013 were Syrian citizens--up from 57 the year before, down from 114 two years earlier. In the fiscal year through September 2014, U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement reported removing nine Syrians from the U.S.--compared to, say, nearly 177,000 people from Mexico and more than 120,000 individuals from Central America. Possible factors So there might not be many Syrians approaching Laredo. We wondered why Syrians would try to enter that way regardless. Joshua Landis, president of the Syrian Studies Association and director of the Center for Middle East Studies, said by phone there was no reason to be surprised by Syrian asylum seekers. ""The amount of destruction in their country is just stupefying,"" he said.   A four-year-long civil war between government forces and various rebel groups, including ISIS, has intensified in recent months with bombing campaigns by the United States, Russia, Jordan, France, Saudi Arabia and others, leaving much of the country in shambles. According to an Oct. 27, 2015, report by the United Nations, the conflict has left 13.5 million people, including 6 million children, in need of protection and aid. Landis said half the homes in Syria had been destroyed, while 30 percent of schools remain operational and electricity and clean water are scarce commodities. Our ruling Abbott tweeted that Syrians were ""caught"" by federal agents at the border in Laredo which, he said, explains why ""Texas is vigilant about Syrian refugees."" His implication was that the potential terrorists were trying to infiltrate Texas, giving fuel to his decision to tell the federal government the state intended not to accept Syrian refugees. Eight Syrians were taken into custody at the port of Laredo, we confirmed. But Homeland Security officials said the Syrians had turned themselves in to a Border Patrol agent, seeking asylum. So, Abbott's statement has an element of truth -- Syrians landed in U.S. custody -- but it leaves an incorrect implication of how and why they got there. We rate the claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Do federal officials plan to send 425 Syrian refugees to Florida as Rick Scott says?
","Florida Gov. Rick Scott has joined dozens of governors who say they don’t want to take Syrian refugees following the terrorist attacks in Paris. He criticized the federal government’s plans to take 10,000 Syrian refugees during an interview with Fox News’ Stuart Varney on Nov. 17. ""This is something that they are making the decision, whether we like it or not, to send 425 refugees to our state without giving us any information."" Is Scott right that the feds have decided to send 425 Syrian refugees to Florida with no input from the state? We decided to check it out. Do the feds decide on the number of refugees for Florida? Americans have zeroed in on Syrian refugees following the Nov. 13 Paris attacks, because a supposed Syrian passport was found near the body of one of the terrorists.We should note that is not confirmed; the passport may have been fake, and investigations are underway. The six Paris attackers identified so far were French and Belgian nationals. For the most recent year ending in September, Florida took in 48,816 refugees, with the largest group from Cuba. That number included 104 people from Syria, which has been in a civil war since 2011. Most of the Syrians settled in Duval, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade and Pinellas counties. (We explained the process of extensive background checks in our PolitiFact Sheet.) President Barack Obama announced in September that the federal government would accept an additional 10,000 refugees from Syria for the next year, for a total of 85,000 refugees from all countries. So who decides how many come to Florida? Scott said that the federal government made the decision to send 425. While the federal government is in charge of resettlement, the actual number comes from agencies within local communities in Florida. (Politico also noted this in a report on Scott's comments.) At the beginning of each federal fiscal year, the State Department works with nine national volunteer agencies to allocate the number of refugees per agency. They take into account factors such as whether the refugees have family members in certain states, their employment and educational backgrounds, and if they have any health concerns, according to Mark Hetfield, the president and CEO of HIAS, formerly known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. In Florida, there are 25 local affiliates that are a part of those national groups. The local affiliates in Miami, Tampa, Clearwater and other cities inform the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) and the U.S. State Department how many refugees from across the globe the affiliates can handle for the fiscal year. For the current year, the total added up to 3,942, according to DCF. And that’s the number that the federal government signed off on for Florida. Recently, the government asked states if they could accept more refugees. On Nov. 9, Lawrence Bartlett, a State Department official, wrote a letter to DCF noting that Obama increased the maximum number of Syrian refugees and would ask the nonprofit groups how many additional refugees they could take. Local affiliates told state and federal officials they could take an additional 425 refugees. Technically, those 425 aren’t all guaranteed to be Syrians, according to DCF, but the Syrian crisis is what prompted the request. So far, federal officials haven’t approved any particular number for Florida. ""We don’t know how many Syrians will be resettled into any one state or city at this point,"" Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman, told PolitiFact Florida. ""Regarding the local agencies' letter saying they can take an additional 425 refugees, it is likely that we can expect there will be a similar letter approving that number as well. Those 425 refugees will come from all over the world."" That means that officially, the federal government hasn’t decided yet to send 425 refugees to Florida, but it appears possible that that will end up being the number -- although they may not all be Syrians. When we asked Scott’s office about his media appearances quoting the 425 figures, it pointed us to more cautious wording that Scott used in a Nov. 16 letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asking them to cut off funding for the resettlement: ""Please be aware that several organizations have requested that our state Department of Children and Families support the relocation of possible 425 Syrian refugees to Florida, as they receive federal funding to house those refugees in our state."" Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz told PolitiFact Florida that ""in his letter he was very clear to say ‘possible 425.’ ... The governor is very concerned -- it could be 425. All we know is it is possibly 425."" Scott has a point when he says the refugees get sent to the states ""whether we like it or not."" The Refugee Act of 1980 says the federal government is expected ""to the maximum extent possible"" to take states’ concerns into account, but there are no legal consequences if federal officials ignore governors such as Scott. State officials don’t have veto power, because the federal government has the sole authority over immigration decisions, including refugees. Our ruling Rick Scott says the federal government is ""making the decision, whether we like it or not, to send 425 refugees to our state"" from Syria. Scott’s statement makes it sound like federal officials came up with a number of refugees and dictated that Florida must take them in. That’s misleading, because the number came from local resettlement agencies, which reported to the federal government how many additional refugees they could handle within the next year. Those refugees might or might not all be Syrians, though it seems likely they would be. Scott has a point that the power to resettle refugees lies with the federal government, and he can’t halt the refugees from coming to Florida. We rate this statement Half True.",/factchecks/2015/nov/20/rick-scott/do-federal-officials-plan-send-425-syrian-refugees/

Trump says NYPD used to spy on mosques
","Following the terrorist attacks in Paris that killed more than 120 this weekend, 2016 presidential candidates are debating how to prevent another terrorist attack on U.S. soil. Republican front-runner Donald Trump, in an interview for MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Nov. 16, 2015, said he would consider surveillance of mosques as a protective measure against radical Islam -- an idea similar to that recently proposed by French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve. ""You’re going to have to watch and study the mosques, because a lot of talk is going on at the mosques,"" Trump said. ""In the old days, meaning a while ago, we had great surveillance going on in and around mosques in New York City. And I understand our mayor totally cut that out... I’m not sure it’s a fact."" Well, the Donald’s sources have part of the story -- the New York Police Department used to have a squad dedicated to spying on Muslim communities, and the team was disbanded in 2014. Other aspects of the story, however, aren't so clear. Mapping out Muslims In 2003, the CIA helped the New York Police Department create a squad dedicated to surveilling Muslim communities, called the Demographics Unit, as part of broad policy changes following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The Demographics Unit typically consisted of a dozen members, and it focused on identifying places where potential terrorists might be able to blend in with the rest of society. The police essentially mapped out Muslim communities inside and outside the city, detailing where people in traditional Islamic clothes ate, worshipped, shopped and more. According to the New York Times, ""plainclothes detectives looked for ‘hot spots’ of radicalization that might give the police an early warning about terrorist plots."" The result of the surveillance operations: a rift between the Muslim community and law enforcement, two ongoing federal lawsuits and a failure to generate any terror cases. The Demographics Unit wasn’t the only Muslim-focused surveillance effort in New York. Informants for the NYPD also collected the personal information of members of Muslim student groups on college campuses. Analysts also kept tabs on influential Muslim figures and scholars through college websites and email groups. Police also investigated mosques in the city and labeled certain locations as ""terrorism enterprises,"" which supposedly allowed the police to collect license plate numbers in parking lots, video worshippers and secretly record sermons. None of this surveillance ever led to charges that those mosques or Islamic organizations were related to terrorism. Shutting it down The program was kept under wraps until the Associated Press published an investigation into the police department’s intelligence operations in 2011. Following the AP’s report, John Brennan, President Barack Obama’s counterterrorism adviser, said he was ""aware of things that NYPD has been doing, in an exceptionally good way, to protect the citizens of New York City on a daily basis."" The NYPD received enormous backlash from civil rights groups over the new details on the Demographics Unit, but the surveillance program remained active until January 2014, when newly elected Mayor Bill de Blasio took office and appointed William J. Bratton as police commissioner. In April 2014, members of the Muslim American Civil Liberties Coalition (MACLC), a New York-based coalition, met with Bratton and other police officials to discuss shutting down the Demographics Unit. The surveillance squad was officially disbanded the next week. ""The meeting resulted from a request by police reform and civil rights advocates, and the participants used the opportunity to articulate how the NYPD’s dragnet has harmed American Muslim communities and why it must come to an end,"" according to a MACLC press release. The move to shut down the Demographics Unit could have been political. But whether or not de Blasio himself ""totally cut out"" the surveillance program is debatable. According to the New York Times, the move was viewed as a sign that the new police commissioner was distancing himself from the sometimes controversial post-Sept. 11 intelligence practices under former mayor Michael Bloomberg. That’s not to suggest de Blasio wasn’t involved in the discussions surrounding the spying program. While running for mayor in 2012, de Blasio said he believed the surveillance program was legal and was created in good faith to protect New Yorkers. When the program was shuttered in 2014, de Blasio seemed to flip on the issue. ""Our administration has promised the people of New York a police force that keeps our city safe, but that is also respectful and fair,"" de Blasio said in a press release. ""This reform is a critical step forward in easing tensions between the police and the communities they serve, so that our cops and our citizens can help one another go after the real bad guys."" Shutting down the Demographics Unit didn’t necessarily mean the NYPD stopped keeping tabs on the Islamic community. The New York Times reported that after the surveillance program was disbanded, the police continued to recruit Muslims to be informants for the department. While police officials said the interviews to recruit informants were voluntary, some of the Muslims who were probed said they were ""shaken."" One person whom police tried to recruit told the New York Times that an officer told him, ""You just go to the mosque and the cafe and just say to us if somebody is talking about anything, anything suspicious."" We should note that it is unclear if or how the New York Police Department is still surveilling Muslims, especially after new terrorist threats against New York City. Faiza Patel, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, said the police have not shuttered its entire surveillance program related to Muslims. ""The NYPD has not, to my knowledge, stopped spying on mosques,"" Patel said. De Blasio has continued to defend the Demographics Unit amidst renewed public attention and federal lawsuits. While a federal judge in New Jersey dismissed a lawsuit over the surveillance last year, a U.S. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia revived the case in October. Finally, Trump said the surveillance program was ""great,"" but not everyone feels that way. Critics of the program have argued that the Demographics Unit only further alienated the Muslim community following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. ""The Demographics Unit created psychological warfare in our community,"" Linda Sarsour, a member of the Arab American Association of New York, told the New York Times. ""Those documents, they showed where we live. That’s the cafe where I eat. That’s where I pray. That’s where I buy my groceries. They were able to see their entire lives on those maps. And it completely messed with the psyche of the community."" When we reached out to the mayor’s office, de Blasio praised the NYPD’s anti-terrorism efforts but didn’t directly address the now-shuttered Demographics Unit. ""First and foremost, we always will abide by the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits discrimination against religions,"" de Blasio wrote in a statement. ""Mosques don't commit acts of terrorism. People do."" Our ruling Trump said the New York Police Department used to conduct ""surveillance in and around mosques in New York City. Our mayor totally cut that out."" While Trump doesn’t paint the full picture, there is evidence that supports his point: the New York Police Department used to spy on Muslims. The program actually went further than just surveilling mosques -- detectives mapped out entire Muslim communities, tracked Muslims’ daily activities, investigated Muslim college students and more. The project was shut down, but it was the police commissioner, not the mayor, who officially closed the program. The commissioner is the mayor’s appointee and in all likelihood acted with the mayor’s approval. We can’t say with certainty what kind of surveillance the police department conducts now. But Trump is right that a high-profile program was shuttered. We rate this statement Half True.",/factchecks/2015/nov/20/donald-trump/trump-says-nypd-used-spy-mosques/

Rep. Glenn Grothman says his district has more manufacturing jobs than any other district
","In making the transition from state lawmaker to a U.S. Congressman, Republican Glenn Grothman has learned a few things about national issues -- and his new district. As a candidate in 2014, Grothman -- like the other Republicans seeking the open seat -- opposed the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Grothman called the agency a form of ""corporate welfare"" and promised not to support the institution. But employers in his district told him they are heavy users of the bank, which helps companies sell their goods and services in foreign countries by providing financing for export deals. Ultimately, Grothman voted to support reauthorization of the bank -- a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter. At the time, he said he reconsidered after listening to Wisconsin employers who benefit from the bank. And Grothman told us that, since taking office, he’s learned a lot about the 6th District. With about 710,000 residents, it’s a little more than four times as large as his state Senate district. One tidbit he picked up: ""This district has more manufacturing jobs than almost any other"" in the nation. That claim caught our attention. Is Grothman right? Behind the numbers Before we dig into the numbers, let’s look at some of the manufacturers in his district that urged him to support the Export-Import bank. In all, Grothman said he heard from 42 businesses. Those companies include defense contractor Oshkosh Corp. and crane manufacturer Manitowoc Co. Grothman said he knew manufacturing was important to Wisconsin, but initially assumed that Congressional districts in large cities like Chicago might have a greater share of manufacturers. As backup on the claim the 6th District is among the most manufacturing-heavy in the nation, Grothman pointed us to a January 2015 report from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute on the importance of manufacturing jobs. According to the report, which is build on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: Wisconsin is the nation’s No. 2 state in percentage of total employment which are manufacturing jobs, behind Indiana. The report said that as of 2013, there were 458,400 manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin, about 16.3 percent of the state workforce. The 6th District has about 80,000 manufacturing jobs out of a workforce of 353,700. That’s a share of 22.6 percent, putting it third, behind two districts in Indiana - one in the far northeast corner and the other in the north western portion of the state. The 6th District is No. 1 in terms of total manufacturing employment, followed by the 3rd District in Indiana which has 76,200. Four Wisconsin congressional districts (the 1st, 5th 6th, and 8th) are in the top 11 nationally, in terms of manufacturing jobs as a share of total employment. All are represented in the House by Republicans.  The 1st is in the southern and eastern part of the state, represented by Paul Ryan; the 5th, represented by Jim Sensenbrenner, includes suburban counties north and west of Milwaukee; the 6th is represented by Grothman and the 8th is in northeastern Wisconsin, represented by Reid Ribble. Our rating Grothman’s introduction to Washington included some insights --and political pressure -- about his district that caused him to switch his position on the Export-Import Bank. In explaining his switch, he said the 6th District has more manufacturing jobs than almost any other other in the nation. He’s right both in terms of the percent of jobs in manufacturing (3rd) and the raw number (1st).

Paris-vaccination conspiracy missing facts
","Shots for everyone! Now that’s the kind of sentiment PolitiFact Georgia could get behind. Then we opened the email with that subject line and saw our alert reader meant vaccinations, not Fireball. The question was about a meme that appeared on Facebook and other social media sites in the wake of the terrorist attack in Paris. The wording, over the image of a syringe with a skull inside and the words National Mandatory Vaccinations stamped on top, was awkwardly clear: ""While Americans pray for Paris, France, their government sent HR (House Resolution) 2232 to Congress,"" it read. The implication, of course, is that politicians took advantage of an international tragedy to quickly enact controversial legislation (all with a complicit press). Thank goodness for Internet memes, right? The facts Wrong. To be clear, HR 2232 exists. U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Florida, introduced the Vaccinate All Children Act of 2015 on May 1. Her proposal would restrict the federal government from awarding preventive health service grants to state-level entities unless that state required all public schoolchildren be vaccinated. Exemptions are in place, only for medical reasons. While in theory that means it would remain a state decision to enact vaccination rules for public schools, the federal government’s deep pockets have historically brought states in line. The most famous example was the Reagan administration’s decision in 1984 to use of the Highway Trust Fund to get states to raise the drinking age to 21.  States that didn’t comply with the new national standard would see 10 percent of their federal highway funds cut. Eventually, every state agreed – and ensured that what amounted to several million dollars in some places would continue to flow. So while the proposal does not officially make vaccinations mandatory, that would likely be the end result if it were passed into law. Except for one major flaw with the meme. There was no movement on the bill since the massacre in Paris. In fact, there hasn’t been any action on the proposal since the GOP-controlled House assigned it to a subcommittee a week after Wilson introduced it. And there likely won’t be. ""It’s a Democratic bill, and it doesn’t look like a coordinated move by the Democrats,"" said Kerwin Swint, chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. ""This looks like a lone wolf type bill. It hasn’t moved because it’s not going to."" The conspiracy So then why the meme? Several discredited claims about vaccines – most notably the thoroughly debunked link between the shots and autism – reared up again after a measles outbreak traced to Disneyland in California sickened 147 people in the United States.  The theme park outbreak – and the first reported American death from measles in 12 years – led to a new law in California that revoked ""personal belief"" exemptions and required all children in public schools without medical reasons to be immunized. ""While I absolutely understand the freedom to say no to healthcare, I don’t think it’s a freedom to extend when it’s to protect your child or to you put others at risk with your choice,"" said Arthur Caplan, the director of medical ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center. ""It’s not a bad idea to consider this on a national level."" Pushback and skepticism, though, has been fierce, from everyone from Hollywood celebrities who long objected to immunizations to the two physicians running for the Republican presidential nomination. The anti-vaccination movement is one place where the left and right converge and from that, can move onto greater conspiracies, said Mark Fenster, University of Florida law professor who studies conspiracy theories. The Paris attacks, then, are a ""false flag,"" an operation designed by conspiring forces – this time the media, government and pharmaceutical companies – to distract Americans from the goal of dangerous immunizations. A similar ""false flag"" theory is touted by some in connection with the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. There, the conspiracy goes, the government staged a horrible massacre in a bid to take citizens’ guns. ""The anti-vaccine movement is obsessed with their fear of vaccines, and they view any government effort to require their use as a threat,"" Fenster said. ""Vaccines may have nothing to do with Paris, but the movement views it as a way to ram through this law while no one is watching,"" he added. Our ruling A meme making the rounds on social media takes a different tack on the Paris terrorist attacks. It claims the tragedy has been a distraction to government efforts to mandate vaccinations for all public schoolchildren. There is a proposal for a similar law, but there has been no movement on the proposal since a week after it was introduced last spring. That’s the last bit of truth to the meme. The rest of the message and implication border on the ludicrous. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2015/nov/20/viral-image/paris-vaccination-meme-base-fact/

Fox's Cavuto stacks Medicare spending against wealthiest 1% with dodgy results
","Fox Business Network host Neil Cavuto put a college organizer in the hot seat when she came on his show to talk about the need to reduce college debt. Cavuto pressed Keely Mullen with the Million Student March on how she would pay for a program to make public college tuition-free, forgive all current college debt and pay college students $15 an hour. ""If you wanted all that stuff, someone has to pick up the tab,"" Cavuto asked on his Nov. 12 show. ""Who would that be?"" ""The 1 percent of society that are hoarding all the wealth and causing a catastrophe that students are facing,"" Mullen answered. Cavuto pushed back and presented Mullen with this scenario to demonstrate the limits of getting the wealthy to pony up. ""They’ve done studies on this, Keely,"" Cavuto said. ""I don’t want to get boring here. But even if you were to take the 1 percent, and take all of their money, tax it 100 percent. Do you know it wouldn’t keep Medicare -- just Medicare -- going for three years? "" Several readers asked us to check Cavuto’s basic math. Could the wealthiest 1 percent pay for Medicare for three years or not? We don’t want to get boring either, but reader be warned: Numbers, multiplication and subtraction lie ahead. We asked the Fox Business Network for studies backing up Cavuto’s math.  The Fox press office didn’t point us to any studies. Instead, a spokeswoman explained that Cavuto and his producer averaged the yearly income going to the top 1 percent as reported by the Internal Revenue Service for 2011, 2012 and 2013. They came up with ""about $1.75 trillion."" For the cost of Medicare, they went to two sources: The Kaiser Family Foundation, which we’ll get to in a moment, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services web page on national health expenditures for 2013. That page gave them the figure of $585.7 billion of Medicare expenditures. They multiplied the Medicare number by three and found that it would be $1.755 trillion over three years. The correct number is actually $1.757 trillion, but the point remains the same. Using Cavuto’s estimate, three years of Medicare spending is more than all the money the top 1 percent took in. We tried to repeat Cavuto’s analysis and ran into some issues. Problems with the Medicare dollars Cavuto’s Medicare spending number is not bulletproof. There are credible, lower figures. Medicare spending is reported in two ways: Gross outlays and net outlays. Gross outlays are basically money out the door, and net outlays reduces the total based on the money Medicare takes in apart from the federal budget and the payroll tax. We found a discrepancy in the gross outlay number. While the CMS fact sheet does report $585.7 billion in gross spending, the Medicare Trustees, the program’s overseers, reported a slightly lower $582.9 billion for 2013. Since that comes from the Trustees' official report to Congress, we gave it some weight. (The difference is due to accounting rules.) We also found that the other source cited by Fox Business, the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is widely seen as a neutral source of health care data, focuses on the net outlays, not the gross spending. Fox Business directed us to the foundation’s Medicare fact-sheet. That page reports the net figure, which factors in billions of dollars of premiums paid by Medicare users, along with recaptured inappropriate payments to providers.   For 2013, Kaiser reported net spending of $492 billion. Juliette Cubanski, a top Medicare analyst at Kaiser, explained that the net amount does a better job of capturing the burden on taxpayers as a whole. ""Showing the gross spending amount would, in a way, overstate federal spending on Medicare because some of that amount comes back to the Treasury in the form of premiums,"" Cubanski said. So the Medicare Trustees provided a slightly lower number than Cavuto used, and his other source provided a significantly lower number. Both measures put his math at risk. Problems with the top 1 percent dollars Cavuto used IRS data for 2011, 2012 and 2013. It’s easy to find the IRS analysis of the Adjusted Gross Income, or AGI, for the top 1 percent for 2011 and 2012. But the official analysis only comes out about three years after the fact, and the 2013 numbers are not available. So where did Cavuto get an estimate for 2013 income? His staff said he used an IRS spreadsheet for 2013. However, this only gives you a rough approximation, and when we compared past spreadsheets to the official analyses for 2011 and 2012, we found significant differences. Nonetheless, there is another issue with Cavuto’s income figure. Adjusted Gross Income misses a fair chunk of the money people actually make. There are many deductions in taxable income that come before taxpayers reaches that point in their tax returns. One of the largest takes the form of tax-free contributions to a retirement account. In a perfect world, one would be able to say precisely the actual incomes, before any deductions, of the top 1 percent. In practice, that turns out to be a tricky business, said Daniel Feenberg, a tax expert at the National Bureau of Economic Research. ""There are many ways to do this calculation, including many that are correct but differ from each other,"" Feenberg said. The Tax Policy Center, a joint effort of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, has a method to estimate what it calls the ""cash income"" of tax filers. Its model adds back in the dollars put into a retirement account, along with non-taxable Social Security and pension income, and various other pots of money. Averaging the center’s estimates of cash income for the top 1 percent for 2011, 2012 and 2013 produces a total of $1.85 trillion. That’s about $100 billion more than Cavuto’s estimate for the top 1 percent. The center’s co-director William Gale warned us that using tax returns to measure income totally misses a major source of income for the top 1 percent: gains on financial holdings that accrue but aren’t cashed out. ""When Warren Buffett’s stocks go up up by X billion over a year, none of that shows up in his AGI unless he sells some of the assets,"" Gale said. Setting aside the huge policy debate involved here, measuring income in any given year is a particularly poor yardstick for the financial capacity of the top 1 percent. Way more than most people, they get to decide when to turn their wealth into income. Running the numbers For the last step of this fact-check, we stress-tested Cavuto’s assertion. The math is simple: You triple a given Medicare spending number and subtract that from an income estimate. We did the math using three different amounts for Medicare spending and three different estimates of the income of the top 1 percent. For the IRS, we use the most recent available AGI figure from 2012. (We know that due to efforts to avoid higher capital gains taxes, many people sold assets in 2012. This artificially raised the AGI figure that year, but we’ve yet to find a report that shows the size of that effect in terms of the income of the top 1 percent.) With that caveat, here is the table -- using all the sources above -- showing what you’re left with when you take one year of income for the 1 percent and subtract the three-year cost of Medicare. A negative number means the Medicare total was more than the income --  as Cavuto said. The green background is where Cavuto is correct. The red is where he is not. The amounts are in billions of dollars.  There’s only one outcome that supports Cavuto’s assertion that the income of the 1 percent wouldn’t pay for three years of Medicare spending — the one that uses his own sources. The remaining eight scenarios based on other reputable sources show the income of the 1 percent exceeding three years of Medicare spending, ranging from a difference of $1.3 billion to $504 billion. Cavuto’s method is very sensitive to small shifts in the numbers. Even using his income estimate but relying on the gross spending figure from the Medicare Trustees, he missed the mark. Not by much, but his assertion is still not right. The gap only gets wider if you use any other estimate of income and any other Medicare spending amount. If you use the Kaiser Family Foundation’s number for Medicare ($492 billion) and the the Tax Policy Center’s number for income ($1.85 trillion), the money from the wealthiest 1 percent would cover Medicare for about three years and nine months. Our ruling Cavuto said that one year of the income of the top 1 percent would not pay for three years of Medicare. His point was that the financial capacity of the top 1 percent is not unlimited. He bolstered his point with a definitive statement, but the underlying math is flawed. Cavuto used the highest number we could find for the cost of Medicare. While he may have relied on an official web page for his Medicare number, we found an equally official source, the Medicare Trustees, that reported a lower figure. That small difference in itself made his claim incorrect. Other measures of Medicare spending made it even more incorrect. His income figure, based on an approach he never fully described, is guaranteed to undercount the actual income of the top 1 percent. There is a sliver of accuracy in his calculation, but the weight of the numbers goes against him. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/nov/19/neil-cavuto/foxs-cavuto-stacks-medicare-spending-against-wealt/

Phone, voting records back up claims in attack ad against David Vitter
","U.S. Sen. David Vitter entered the Louisiana governor’s race this year as the clear front-runner. But a prostitution scandal from years ago has left Vitter, a veteran Republican with widespread name recognition in the deep red state, in a difficult race against a lesser-known Democrat, state Rep. John Bel Edwards. In Louisiana’s open primary on Oct. 24, Edwards finished first among four candidates; Vitter was a distant second. Two weeks later, Edwards’ campaign released an ad called ""The Choice."" It highlights Vitter’s connection to ""D.C. Madam"" Deborah Palfrey, which was revealed in 2007 when an investigator working for Hustler obtained phone records from Palfrey and identified Vitter’s number. Vitter’s connection to Palfrey isn’t new. For years he avoided the issue after obliquely addressing it in 2007. It apparently had little effect on his 2010 bid for a second term in the Senate, which he won easily. But his connection to the D.C. Madam has percolated in this year’s governor’s race as new allegations emerged. Edwards’ ad, released the day before early voting began for the general election, put the issue on TV screens throughout the state. After it was released, ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd said it ""might be the most vicious negative ad ever."" The ad features a female narrator who says: The choice for governor couldn’t be more clear. John Bel Edwards, who answered our country’s call and served as a ranger in the 82nd Airborne Division, or David Vitter, who answered a prostitute’s call minutes after he skipped a vote honoring 28 soldiers who gave their lives in defense of our freedom. David Vitter chose prostitutes over patriots. Now the choice is yours. The ad makes two claims about Vitter: He skipped a vote for a resolution honoring American soldiers killed in the line of duty, and he answered a call from Palfrey’s phone soon after. It then concludes that Vitter ""chose prostitutes over patriots,"" suggesting the two are related. The basics are not hard to substantiate. Then-U.S. Rep. David Vitter did, in fact, miss the vote in question. On Feb. 27, 2001, the House overwhelmingly passed a resolution to honor 28 soldiers killed in 1991 during Operation Desert Storm, with 395 votes in favor. Two congressmen answered ""present"" but did not vote. Vitter was one of 35 marked absent. We asked Vitter’s campaign where he was that day, but the campaign declined to answer. There were no other roll-call votes that day, according to House records, nor were there any the day before, the first day after a congressional recess. That vote was recorded at 5:27 p.m. ET. Thirty-nine minutes later, at 6:06 p.m. in Washington, a call was placed from Palfrey’s cell phone to Vitter’s, according to her cell phone records. It lasted about a minute. However, the presence of a call on a phone bill doesn’t mean that Vitter picked up, rather than his voicemail. (If you find this fascinating, we recommend the podcast ""Serial,"" which explores such issues in detail.) Vitter has never directly admitted or denied patronizing Palfrey’s service, though he’s come close. In 2007, after media outlets reported Hustler’s findings, he apologized in a statement for a ""very serious sin"" but didn’t elaborate. He’s been similarly evasive during this year’s governor’s race. In an ad his campaign released after ""The Choice,"" Vitter says, ""Fifteen years ago, I failed my family,"" but it elaborates no further. Asked this week during a debate if he took the call, Vitter refused to answer. Likewise, Vitter’s campaign did not respond to our questions about the ad. Edwards’ campaign did not respond to a request for additional evidence beyond what’s cited in the ad. (Palfrey died in 2008.) With Vitter unwilling to talk, we wondered if he was even in Washington that day, considering that Feb. 27, 2001, was Mardi Gras. That’s a big deal in Louisiana, and Vitter has expressed great personal fondness for the holiday. Considering that Carnival coincided with Congress’ winter break, it was possible that Vitter was back in Louisiana. But he was in Washington that night. As Louisiana State University Professor Robert Mann noted in a recent Salon column, President George W. Bush addressed a joint session of Congress at 9 p.m. Vitter is visible in the audience about 24 minutes in and a half-hour later. Moreover, a House report, detailing members’ use of congressional funds for office and travel expenses, shows that Vitter claimed an airfare expense that day. Flight records from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics show five direct flights from New Orleans to Washington-area airports that day prior to Bush’s speech. Arrival times ranged from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. There, our reporting on this track reached a dead end. Our ruling Edwards’ ad says Vitter took a call from a prostitute minutes after skipping the vote. The only thing we don’t know is if Vitter answered his phone. Even if he didn’t, he has still been connected to the D.C. Madam. ""The Choice"" doesn’t quite close the deal in suggesting that Vitter missed the vote because of his dealings with a prostitute, which is what it suggests when it says he ""chose prostitutes over patriots."" But the key parts of the statement in question — that Vitter ""answered a prostitute’s call minutes after he skipped a vote"" — are accurate. We rate this statement Mostly True.

Ben Carson: 'There is currently no ability to vet' Syrian refugees
","In the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris, many have suggested that, given the lack of proper screening, accepting Syrian refugees would be akin to inviting in the enemy. ""There is currently no ability to vet these people. By letting refugees into our country without vetting we are putting America at risk,"" Republican candidate Ben Carson wrote in an official statement posted on Facebook on Nov. 16. Is Carson right that we don’t vet the refugees? Well, it’s more that we can’t, Carson spokesperson Doug Watts told us. ""There is no foolproof and effective way of vetting these people,"" Watts said. ""That’s his opinion, shared by millions of others, and confirmed by thousands of felonies occurring at the hands of both legal and illegal immigrants."" But Carson said we don’t vet refugees, and that isn’t correct. Carson has a point that the system isn’t foolproof, but the ability to screen refugees does exist. How we vet refugees Let’s begin with an overview of the refugee admissions process, which has been in place since 1980 and was retooled after 9/11. Before refugees even face U.S. vetting, they must first clear an eligibility hurdle. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees — or occasionally a U.S. embassy or another NGO — determines who counts as a refugee, who should be resettled (about 1 percent) and which countries would take them. This can take four to 10 months. Once the cases are referred to the United States, refugees are vetted through a process that involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies. Typically, about half of refugees are approved, according to the State Department. Refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks. Their names, biographical information and fingerprints are run through databases coordinated by the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense. For Syrian refugees, there’s one additional step. Their filings with the UN and initial documents submitted to the U.S. program are reviewed. Information about where they came from, what caused them to flee and what their experiences were like are cross-referenced with classified and unclassified information. According to Buzzfeed, Syrian refugees are also being vetted through a secret national security screening program. The program, the Controlled Application Review and Resolution Process, is specifically used to screen people deemed potential national security threats. While the checks are being conducted, trained DHS officers interview refugees in person. (Most interviews with Syrian refugees happen in Amman, Istanbul and Cairo.) Refugees who’ve been cleared by the officer, the State Department and the background checks then undergo medical screenings, a match with a sponsor agency, ""cultural orientation"" classes and one final security clearance. This process typically takes one to two years, if not longer, and happens before a refugee ever gets onto American soil. Gaps and challenges There are undoubtedly challenges to vetting refugees, with intelligence and national security officials highlighting the paucity of data in particular. The head of the National Counterterrorism Center told Congress in October that the intelligence in Syria is ""not as rich as we would like it to be,"" while FBI Director James Comey told Congress that there are ""gaps"" in data availability. ""If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home, but there will be nothing show up because we have no record of them,"" Comey said in a House Committee on Homeland Security hearing on Oct. 21. The lack of U.S. relationships with Syrian government and law enforcement and the use of fake passports and fraudulent documents are also causes for concern, according to Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, which describes itself as ""low immigration, pro-immigrant."" ""The country is in chaos and the identities and claims of the applicants are nearly impossible to verify. We can check our databases and fingerprint repositories, and so on, but if we have collected little information on Syrians, it will not help,"" Vaughan said The case against alarm Challenges, however, don’t translate into ""no ability"" to vet at all. ""No system is foolproof. If we really wanted a foolproof system, we would shut down immigration entirely,"" said David Martin, a University of Virginia professor who’s previously held posts at DHS and the State Department. ""The alarm is way overblown."" Experts and advocates pushed back on the notion that we accept refugees with no intelligence at all. In contrast to refugees worldwide, Syrians tend to have identity documents and the reasons they give for missing documents (i.e. a barrel bomb dropping on their house) can be verified, according to the State Department. There’s no real precedent of a terrorist slipping in through the U.S. refugee system. The concerns stemming from the Syrian passport found in connection to the Paris attacks don’t apply here, experts said. That’s because the European vetting process for refugees arriving by sea is extremely chaotic and not comparable to the processes used by the UN and United States. In the United States, very few resettled refugees — three since 9/11, according to the Washington Post Fact Checker — have been implicated in terrorist situations. Daryl Grisgraber of Refugees International pointed out that the Tsarnaevs came to the United States as children from Chechnya and applied for asylum, but were radicalized here. ""We’ve also resettled thousands in recent years from the Central African Republic, Somalia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, all of which have faced similar terrorist threats and have unstable governments that present challenges for the vetting process. But we’ve done this successfully time and time again without incident,"" said Geoffrey Mock, the Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA. And finally, refugees are subject to the highest level of security checks of any category of traveler to the United States. So for ISIS to take advantage of the refugee program ""makes no operational sense,"" said Anne Speckhard, a counterterrorism expert at Georgetown University. It would be more likely for ISIS to find Europeans who could travel to the United States on business or tourist visas. ""Given how easy it is to send a European extremist to the U.S. via Europe, why would an ISIS guy in Syria wait the three years it takes to get refugee status?"" she said. Our ruling Carson said, ""There is currently no ability to vet these people,"" referring to Syrian refugees.

There are 45 states that allow open carry for firearms, former NRA president says
","The former president of the National Rifle Association is defending bills in the Florida Legislature proposing the open carry of handguns, saying the vast majority of states already allow the practice. Marion Hammer, currently executive director of United Sportsmen of Florida, responded to criticism of SB 300 and its companion in the House, HB 163. In a column posted on the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action website on Nov. 1, 2015, Hammer pointed out how many states allow open carry. ""Forty-five (45) states allow open carry of firearms,"" she wrote. ""Varying restrictions on open carry in some states does not alter the fact that 45 states allow open carry."" Hammer was refuting Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, who is the Florida Sheriffs Association Legislative Committee chairman. Gualtieri, whose group opposes the bills, previously told the Palm Beach Post it’s not really accurate to say those 45 states allow open carry because there are various rules and restrictions on the practice. PolitiFact Florida decided to get to the bottom of just how many states do let you carry guns openly in public. Laws across states The bills filed in the state Legislature would allow anyone with a valid concealed weapons permit to also carry their handgun openly, a practice currently prohibited by law. Obtaining a license for concealed carry already includes requirements for registration, fingerprinting and firearm training. Florida has about 1.4 million concealed weapon permit holders. Both bills are pending approval by committees before the 2016 legislative session. Hammer told PolitiFact Florida that her figure came from the NRA’s own research of state laws. According to that analysis, there are four other states that prohibit handgun open carry in public places like Florida — California, Illinois, New York and South Carolina. The District of Columbia does not allow it, either. Hammer is equating the lack of an outright ban in other states with the other 45 states allowing the practice, but it isn’t quite that cut and dried. There are different rules and restrictions in different places, and some so-called open carry states can be very specific about what’s required. The Florida bills address the open carry of handguns, so that's the context of Hammer's column. There are other states that allow the open carry of handguns while restricting long guns, such as rifles and shotguns. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence agrees with the NRA on the same five states that prohibit open carry. But the center points out that Massachusetts, Minnesota and New Jersey prohibit the open carry of long guns, just as Florida, California, Illinois and D.C. do. But New York and South Carolina allow open carry for long guns, while preventing it for handguns. So Hammer’s statement that 45 states allow the open carry of firearms, period, is imprecise. Further, 15 states require a permit or license to open carry, while eight more have other restrictions on how, when or where you are allowed to do so. Some municipalities restrict open carry in ways their state doesn’t. In Pennsylvania, open carry is generally allowed without a license, but Philadelphia does require a license. There are even more caveats about specific states and where they land on the open carry spectrum. For example, gun rights group OpenCarry.org doesn’t include Texas on its list of open carry states, because its recently passed law doesn’t take effect until Jan. 1, 2016. Like Florida’s proposed change, the state’s concealed carry license will become an open carry license for handguns as well. There are also states that could be categorized differently depending on how you interpret the local laws. The NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action noted Arkansas is hard to categorize. The state decriminalized the open or concealed carry of a loaded handgun in 2013, but the state’s ban was not repealed. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said in a nonbinding opinion that the law was intended to protect people traveling through or across the state, even though open carry was still technically against the law. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence notes you generally can’t carry openly or concealed in Arkansas with the gun ""readily available for use with a purpose to employ (it) as a weapon against a person."" All the groups we consulted agreed California is not an open-carry state because it banned open carry of loaded handguns starting in 2012, but there’s still more to the story. If you live in a California county with less than 200,000 people, you can ask the local sheriff or police chief to give you an open-carry license at his or her discretion. Of course, the license is only good for that county, but there’s wiggle room in saying California prohibits open carry. Our ruling Hammer said, ""Forty-five states allow open carry of firearms."" Groups both for and against stricter gun laws told us there are five states that have laws banning open carry for handguns: California, Florida, Illinois, New York and South Carolina. It’s worth remembering, however, that the laws in some open-carry states are not as permissive as Hammer makes it seem. Several states have restrictions on the open carry of certain types of firearms, and in some places the rules are stricter than others.   We rate Hammer’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/nov/18/marion-hammer/there-are-45-states-allow-open-carry-handguns-form/

Donald Trump says Obama administration is pushing refugees toward states with GOP governors
","As growing numbers of governors were expressing opposition to the resettlement of Syrian refugees in their state, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump raised the ante in an interview with conservative radio host Laura Ingraham. Trump charged that the Obama administration is deliberately trying to resettle Syrian refugees in states with Republican governors while sparing states that have Democratic governors. ""They send them to the Republicans, not to the Democrats, you know, because they know the problems,"" Trump said on Nov. 17, 2015. ""In California, you have a Democrat as a governor (Jerry Brown). In Florida, you have Rick Scott (a Republican). So you know they send them to the Republicans because you know why would we want to bother the Democrats? It's just insane. Taking these people is absolutely insanity."" Is the administration sending refugees to Republican-led states but not Democratic ones? In a word, no. Syrian refugee resettlement by state Before we delve into the numbers, it’s important to note that the Republicans currently have a commanding lead in governorships -- 31 states held by the Republicans compared to just 18 held by the Democrats. (The governor of Alaska is an independent.) Given this imbalance, it would not be surprising to find Republican-led states ending up with more refugees overall than Democratic-led states. So we will look at not just the raw totals per state but also the average number of resettlements per state for each party. According to numbers compiled by the Associated Press, states with Republican governors have accepted 1,219 Syrian refugees since Jan. 1, 2015, compared to 605 for states with Democratic governors. That works out to an average of 39 refugees per Republican-led state and 34 refugees per Democratic-led state. Note that the Democratic-led states have not been spared refugees, as Trump claimed. On a per-state basis, Republican-led states have accepted more Syrian refugees so far in 2015, but not dramatically more. Indeed, only one state accepted more than 200 refugee resettlements -- California, which is led by Brown, a Democrat. We also looked at State Department data for the most recent month, October 2015. According to these numbers, Republican-led states accepted 117 Syrian refugees, while Democratic-led states accepted 70. That works out to 3.8 refugees per state for Republicans and slightly more -- 3.9 refugees per state -- with Democratic governors. So Trump is wrong that Democratic-led states are avoiding resettlement of Syrian refugees. During the most recent period, they are actually accepting more per capita than Republican states are. Who decides where refugees go? Even if Trump had been right on the numbers, experts in refugee resettlement said partisan politics plays no role in determining where refugees end up. Put simply, ""the decision on refugee placement is based first on where the refugee might have family ties or other connections, and then largely on the capacity of voluntary agencies to provide case-management services,"" said Bill Frelick, director of the Human Rights Watch Refugee Rights Program. Mark Hetfield, the president and CEO of HIAS (originally known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), said that at the beginning of each fiscal year, the State Department works with nine national voluntary agencies -- six faith-based, three nonsectarian -- to allocate the number of refugees per agency.   The nine groups are the Church World Service, the Ethiopian Community Development Council, Episcopal Migration Ministries, HIAS, the International Rescue Committee, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, the United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops’ Migration and Refugee Services, and World Relief. ""The capacity at the local level is determined in consultation with local municipalities and state refugee coordinators, who are state officials, along with other community stakeholders,"" Hetfield said. ""The states do not have veto power, but they are very much consulted in the process."" Every Wednesday, Hetfield said, the nine agencies meet to decide which agency will take which newly approved refugees. Files on each refugee household approved for resettlement by the Department of Homeland Security are reviewed with an eye to the size of the household, the gender and age distribution, the educational and employment backgrounds of adult members, whether family members or friends are already living in the United States and are willing to help, and whether there are special considerations, such as a serious health problem. If an agency has a pre-existing relationship to the household -- such as having resettled other family members in the United States -- the case will typically be assigned to that agency, said Susan Martin, a professor of international migration at Georgetown University. Otherwise, the agency will attempt to allocate new refugee households according to numbers of people the agency feels capable of handling, she said. For instance, an agency will consider whether a local affiliate has adequate language resources available for the newly arrived refugees. In other words, the agency -- not the administration -- allocates the refugees to a particular city. ""The administration does not try to influence the process,"" Hetfield said. Some states tend to get higher rates of refugee resettlement because family links are taken into account, Hetfield said. ""That is why Michigan has so many refugees resettled there -- it is where Iraqis and Syrians have expressed a preference, due to family or other community links,"" he said. According to the AP data, Michigan has accepted 195 Syrian refugees this year. So this, and not the fact that Michigan has a Republican governor, is why the state ranks relatively high in refugee resettlement, he said. Our ruling Trump said the federal government is sending refugees to states with governors who are ""Republicans, not to the Democrats."" The numbers show that Democratic-led states recently received almost as many refugees as -- and by some calculations, even more refugees than -- Republican-led states on a per capita basis. Beyond that, though, Trump is wrong to say that refugees are resettled as a form of partisan political vendetta. People who have taken part in the process say that the administration leaves it up to private groups, mostly faith-based groups, to determine where refugees should go, with the decision based on family links, the availability of language resources locally and the ability of local groups to handle the new workload -- not politics.

McCain neither endorsed nor condemned the bailout
","
For many, the scope and complexity of this week’s financial market meltdown was punched home when the Federal Reserve on Sept. 16 launched an $85-billion bailout of insurance giant American International Group.

 

The intervention came just two weeks after the Treasury took over the government-chartered mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and was driven by the fact AIG provided insurance to myriad investors who bought securities tied to the mortgage market.  Had the firm failed and been unable to pay claims on the investors’ losses, it would have unleashed a calamitous ripple effect through global financial markets.

 

All of which didn’t exactly mollify fiscal conservatives who’ve long been leery of any government intervention in private business. The move puzzled Republicans in Congress, because a few days earlier the Bush administration had refused to bail out the investment bank Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy. Moreover, the Fed and the Treasury Department had previously rebuffed AIG’s appeal for a $40 billion bridge loan to avert a downgrade of its credit due to investment losses.

 

On the campaign trail, John McCain stuck firm to his anti-interventionist principles before the bailout was announced. Appearing on NBC’s

Today

show, McCain said AIG should be left on its own. “We cannot have the taxpayers bail out AIG or anybody else,” he said.

 

The GOP presidential candidate echoed those remarks on CNBC’s

Squawk Box

the same day, when he responded to a question about whether, if he were in the Fed’s position, he would let the firm fail. “I think you have to,” McCain replied, adding he knew efforts were afoot to raise enough capital to keep AIG in business.

 

But the day after the bailout was announced, McCain sounded more resigned than resolute, stating that the government had been “forced” into taking action.

 

“Today, the government was forced to commit $85-billion to stop the collapse of AIG,” McCain said in a Sept. 17 statement. “These actions stem from failed regulation, reckless management and a casino culture on Wall Street that has crippled one of the most important companies in America. …The focus of any such action should be to protect the millions of Americans who hold insurance policies, retirement plans and other accounts with AIG. We must not bail out the management and speculators who created this mess. They had months of warnings following the Bear Stearns debacle, and they failed to act. We should never again allow the United States to be in this position. We need strong and effective regulation, a return to job-creating growth and a restoration of ethics and the social contract between businesses and America.""
 
That certainly doesn't sound like a reversal to us. It's true that McCain could have issued a statement denouncing the bailout as the wrong decision, so it's fair to conclude that by saying the government was ""forced to commit $85-billion to stop the collapse of AIG"" he's agreeing that it needed to be done. But this is far from an endorsement of the idea and reads more like a grudging acknowledgment.
 
In Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Sept. 18, McCain was a bit more clear: ""When AIG was bailed out, I didn't like it, but I understood it needed to be done to protect hard working Americans with insurance policies and annuities.""
 
Obama seized on McCain’s statement as evidence of a flip-flop. Speaking in Espanola, N.M., on Sept. 18, Obama said, “On Tuesday, he said the government should stand by and allow one of the nation’s largest insurers to collapse, putting the well-being of millions of Americans at risk. But by Wednesday, he changed his mind.”

 

Obama’s depiction strikes us as over the top. Based on his remarks, McCain seemed willing to swallow some pragmatic trade-offs, given the remarkable circumstances in the markets. And McCain in his statement added that the intervention should not apply to “the management and speculators who created this mess.”

 

Yet it’s debatable whether the government really was forced to take action. It could have allowed another giant corporate bankruptcy that would have accelerated a repricing of credit that’s hitting corporations and individuals alike. Moreover, the government’s action sets a precedent for more costly government bailouts, particularly if some large regional banks or the giant thrift Washington Mutual get sucked down by the crisis. In truth, the decision, for the moment, is being widely viewed as economically prudent and politically wise. Because McCain stopped short of endorsing the bailout even as he declined to criticize it, we rule this one a Half Flip.

Limbaugh's not a McCain spokesman
","
(Published Sept. 19, 2008)
 
A new Spanish-language TV ad from the Barack Obama campaign called ""Dos Caras"" (Two Faces) begins as most of the attack ads against John McCain do — with McCain pictured next to President Bush. The ad then cuts to a bewildering cameo from Rush Limbaugh.
 
In an ad targeted to Spanish-speaking Latino audiences in Florida, New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada, the voiceover begins (according to translations provided by the Obama campaign): ""They want us to forget the insults we’ve put up with…the intolerance…they made us feel marginalized in this country we love so much."" 
 
The screen flashes a picture of conservative radio talk show host Limbaugh above two quotes:
 

""…stupid and unskilled Mexicans""

Rush Limbaugh
 

""You shut your mouth or you get out!""

Rush Limbaugh
 
After the Limbaugh references, the announcer continues: ""John McCain and his Republican friends have two faces. One that says lies just to get our vote and another, even worse, that continues the policies of George Bush that put special interests ahead of working families. John McCain…more of the same old Republican tricks.""
 
The whole thing raises the question, what are quotes from Limbaugh doing in an attack ad against McCain, especially one that highlights immigration?
 
Limbaugh is hardly a McCainiac and in particular has been highly critical of McCain’s views on immigration.
 
Limbaugh and other grass-roots conservatives derided McCain’s 2006 efforts to forge a compromise immigration plan in the Senate that combined border security and work-site enforcement to root out undocumented employees, with a guest worker program for most of the illegal immigrants in the country. Limbaugh called the plan ""amnesty,"" as did some of McCain’s opponents during the Republican primary. We looked at the claim and ruled it

True

when McCain said his plan was not ""amnesty."" We based that on the fact that it would have required illegal immigrants to apply for a six-year conditional nonimmigrant visa. They then could apply for legal permanent residence — a green card — on the condition that they pay $1,000 in fines, pay all back taxes, pass a criminal background check, stay employed and demonstrate an effort to learn English and civics.
 
However, when asked about his support for that immigration plan during a Republican debate in California on Jan. 30, 2008, McCain

backtracked

some and said he would no longer favor that plan because public opinion favored enforcement over citizenship measures. Instead, he would focus first on securing the border.
 
In his radio show on Sept. 18, Limbaugh took some time to

discuss

the Obama campaign ad, and it sure didn’t sound like he’d forgotten McCain’s previous efforts.
 
""This is just absurd because Bush and McCain were both for amnesty!"" Limbaugh said. ""Bush and McCain were these illegals’ best friends, along with Ted Kennedy.""
 
There’s another big problem with the Obama campaign ad; the Limbaugh quotes are lifted out of context.
 
Let’s take the two quotes in order.
 
First: ""…stupid and unskilled Mexicans.""
 
This is a quote from 1993, during the debate over NAFTA. Said Limbaugh: ""A caller called here and was giving me grief for not wanting to do what it took to protect American jobs, and so I said to him, ‘If you are unskilled and uneducated, your job is going south. Skilled workers, educated people are going to do fine ‘cause those are the kinds of jobs NAFTA is going to create. If we are going to start rewarding no skills and stupid people, I’m serious, let the unskilled jobs that take absolutely no knowledge whatsoever to do — let stupid and unskilled Mexicans do that work.’""
 
As is clear here, Limbaugh was not calling Mexicans ""stupid and unskilled.""
 
The second quote: ""You shut your mouth or you get out!""
 
This one comes from 2006, and as you’ll see, Limbaugh here is setting up for a punch line — that he is actually citing Mexican law.
 
""Everybody’s making immigration proposals these days, let me add mine to the mix. Call it the Limbaugh Laws.
 
""First, you emigrate to our country you have to speak the native language, you have to be a professional or an investor, no unskilled workers allowed. Also, there will be no special bilingual programs in the schools with the Limbaugh Laws, no special ballots for elections, no government business will be conducted in your language. Foreigners will not have the right to vote or hold political office.
 
""If you’re in our country, you cannot be a burden to taxpayers. You are not entitled to welfare or food stamps or other government goodies. You can come if you invest here an amount equal to 40,000 times the daily minimum wage. If not, stay home. But if you want to buy land, it will be restricted: no waterfront, for instance, and as a foreigner, you have to relinquish individual rights to the property.
 
""And another thing, you don’t have the right to protest. You’re allowed no demonstrations, no foreign flag waving, no political organizing, no bad-mouthing our president or his policies. You’re a foreigner. Shut your mouth or get out. If you come here illegally, you’re going to jail.
 
""Now, you think the Limbaugh Laws are harsh? Well, every one of the laws I just mentioned are actual laws of Mexico today. That’s how the Mexican government handles immigrants to their country. Yet Mexicans come here illegally and protest in our streets. How do you say, 'double standard' in Spanish? How about, ‘no mas’?""
 


 
In backup material for the ad, the Obama campaign cites a

story

in which McCain did not come out strongly against Minutemen. McCain said he did not agree with them, ""but they are certainly exercising their legal rights as citizens."" Hardly damning stuff.
 
The Obama campaign also noted that McCain and other Republican candidates

declined an invitation

last summer to address NALEO, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.
 
And they suggest that McCain has waffled in his support of something called the DREAM Act, Developmental Relief and Education for Alien Minors, a bill he co-sponsored that would allow people under age 16 who have been in the country for five years to remain and apply to be permanent residents. McCain told the editorial board of the

Sun News

in Myrtle Beach, S.C., last November that although he agreed with it, he would vote against any issue related to immigration reform until the borders are secured. The Obama campaign suggested McCain presented to a different face when speaking to Latinos at the National Council of La Raza Convention in July, but the full text of his answer does not back that up.
 
Anyway, these relatively minor points raised by the Obama campaign are overshadowed by the larger import of the TV ad, which attempts to link McCain to seemingly racially insensitive remarks by Rush Limbaugh. As ABC’s Jake Tapper so aptly notes in his

Political Punch blog

, ""even if one is uninclined to see Limbaugh’s quotes as having been taken unfairly out of context, linking them to McCain makes as much sense as running a quote from Bill Maher and linking it to Obama.""
 
We are inclined to think the Limbaugh quotes were lifted out of context, and we think that presenting them in an ad about McCain’s immigration policy — as if McCain somehow endorsed those comments — isn’t just wrong, it’s ""pantalones en fuego"" wrong.

Congress didn't pass Obama's economic plan
","With global financial markets shaken by the credit crisis, Barack Obama is promoting his ability to devise solutions for a troubled economy. In a Sept. 16 speech in Golden, Colo., Obama took credit for inspiring the economic stimulus package that Congress enacted and President Bush signed in February, saying its components had roots in an economic plan he outlined a month earlier on the campaign trail. ""In January, I outlined a plan to help revive our faltering economy, which formed the basis for a bipartisan stimulus package that passed the Congress,"" Obama said. He went on to criticize his GOP opponent, John McCain, for promoting corporate tax breaks at the same time. The stimulus package was Congress’ attempt to promote consumer spending and revive the flagging economy through a combination of tax rebates, business tax incentives and housing provisions worth a total of $124.5-billion through the end of fiscal 2018. Despite most lawmakers’ initial optimism, recent signs are it hasn’t achieved its intended effect; August housing starts hit a 17-year low and credit rating agencies are forecasting weak holiday sales this winter. But can Obama really take credit for having ""formed the basis"" of the plan? He did articulate some policy proposals that found their way into the package, but he was far from the only politician promoting ways to prime the economy. And in many cases, he was endorsing ideas that already had been raised by others. The economic stimulus plan began life on Jan. 11, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., sent President Bush a letter asking him to help hammer out a bipartisan package to shore up the economy. By enlisting White House involvement, Pelosi and Reid hoped to pre-empt a possible avalanche of competing proposals to address the nation's economic problems. Bush endorsed the idea on Jan. 17, and the next day delivered an economic address calling for tax rebates for individuals and tax breaks for businesses to deliver ""a shot in the arm"" to the faltering economy. Obama announced his plan in a news release on Jan. 13. The backbone of Obama’s plan was tax relief for working-class Americans and senior citizens. He called for an immediate $250 tax cut for workers and their families and a $250 bonus for seniors, to be delivered in their Social Security checks. He advocated further cuts if the economy continued to worsen. And he backed expanding unemployment insurance and providing relief to homeowners hit by the housing crisis. Congress decided to go much further on the question of rebates. The final package incorporated a House-written stimulus plan that directed $600 payments to individuals who paid taxes in 2007 on wages or investment income, and $1,200 for couples. The payments would phase out beginning with individuals who made more than $75,000 in adjusted gross income and couples with more than $150,000. But anyone qualifying for a check would receive an additional $300 for each dependent child under age 17. It should be noted that the practice of providing tax breaks in tough times is not exactly new, meaning no one in the current Congress can claim credit for thinking up the idea. President Bush’s 2001 tax cuts, for example, sent rebates of $300 for individuals and $600 for married couples filing jointly in the hopes of stimulating the economy, though the payments in that instance were called ""advance refunds."" Obama’s call for expanded unemployment insurance never made it into the stimulus package, though Democratic leaders included an extension of the program in a supplemental war spending bill that Congress cleared in June. The provision, which gained traction after the nation’s jobless rate recorded its biggest jump in 20 years, extended unemployment insurance in all states by 13 weeks beyond the 26 weeks already authorized under law. States with unemployment rates of 6 percent or higher got an additional 13 weeks. So while Obama might have broached the idea, it took dire news from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to prod Congress into taking action. Obama’s somewhat vague call for relief to distressed homeowners also was not included in the stimulus package. However, similar, more detailed plans had floated around Congress for nearly a year, as the depth and intensity of the mortgage crisis became apparent. Lawmakers including Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut — a former Democratic presidential candidate — and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, D-Mass., discussed ways of averting more foreclosures as early as March 2007, including creating public-private ""rescue funds"" that ease the way for borrowers to rewrite the terms of their mortgages. These discussions eventually led to provisions in a mortgage relief bill that Congress enacted and President Bush signed on July 30 that established a temporary government program to help borrowers who can’t afford current mortgage payments avoid foreclosure. The program, called HOPE for Homeowners, reinsures mortgages between Oct. 1, 2008 and Sept. 30, 2011, thereby making the government liable if the borrower defaults on the new loan and if the amount received in foreclosure is less than the outstanding principal. The costs of the program will be paid for by funds diverted from mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As to Obama's claim that his economic plan ""formed the basis"" for the package that became law, we see lots to dispute that. Congress had its own ideas about the size of tax rebates to individuals and didn’t adopt Obama’s ideas about unemployment insurance or homeowner relief. What’s more, lawmakers on committees with jurisdiction over the housing market discussed more detailed plans for helping homeowners months before Obama articulated them. Obama clearly deserves credit for offering a plan to bolster the sagging economy before Congress acted. But he is exaggerating the role his plan played in the stimulus package, which was jointly constructed with congressional leaders and the White House. For these reasons, we judge his claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2008/sep/18/barack-obama/congress-didnt-pass-obamas-economic-plan/

A credit for workers cuts taxes for middle class
","
With a plummeting stock market grabbing headlines, Barack Obama tackled the economy in a speech in Elko, Nev.
 
""Change means a tax code that doesn’t reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it,"" Obama said. He then went through a litany of his tax proposals, including, ""I will cut taxes — cut taxes — for 95 percent of all working families.""
 
We've checked out

many claims on taxes

. It's a subject area that's ripe for distortion and attack.
 
But with this affirmative claim, Obama appears to be on solid ground.
 
The linchpin here is Obama's tax credit for workers, which is intended to offset payroll taxes. Single people can qualify for a $500 credit; married people filing together could get $1,000.
 
Obama wants to roll back the Bush tax cuts for people who make $200,000 or more if single and $250,000 or more as a married couple. His tax credits would phase out as they approach these incomes.
 
Most people, though, don't make more than $200,000. In fact, according to Internal Revenue Service statistics, about 97 percent of all filers made less than that.
 
Now it's into the nitty-gritty. Obama said his tax plan would reduce taxes for 95 percent of working families. We consulted the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which has created detailed models for how each candidate's tax proposal would affect American taxpayers. The center's complex model includes the indirect effects of certain tax policies, such as Obama's proposed rate increase for corporations.
 
The Tax Policy Center's analysis does not specifically look at the subset of tax filers who are ""working families."" But the center can make the following statements about Obama's tax proposal, said principal research associate Bob Williams:
 
• 95 percent of all tax filers (working and nonworking) will get a cut in their individual income taxes.
 
• 95 percent of all families with children (working and nonworking) will get a cut in their total federal taxes.
 
Every taxpayer has different individual circumstances, but if you make less than $200,000 a year and you work, we can't see how your taxes would go up under Obama's proposals. IRS data show that 97 percent of tax filers make less than $200,000, so there are even two percentage points worth of leeway there. We rate Obama's statement True.
 

UPDATE:

Since we published this item, the Tax Policy Center researched how Obama's tax proposals would affect workers. They concluded 94.3 percent of workers would receive a tax cut under Obama's plan;

Cherry-picking the record
","It's been nearly 50 years since a sitting senator, John F. Kennedy, has won the presidency, and Barack Obama's recent TV ad assailing John McCain's education record is a good example why.
 
Senators, especially those with long tenures like McCain, have to take a lot of votes and state a lot of positions, all of which can later be used against them – even if the bulk of the senator's record points to a different conclusion than the attacker's.
 
That's certainly the case with Obama's ad, which claims, among other things, that McCain ""voted to cut education funding, against accountability standards. He even proposed abolishing the Department of Education.""
 
In each case, there's an example or two bolstering Obama's claims, but there are other examples in McCain's nearly 22 years in the Senate, more telling, that show that McCain generally supports increased funding for education, stronger accountability standards and a more powerful Education Department.
 
On the first point, the Obama campaign cites a number of examples where McCain didn't support large increases in education funding backed by Democrats, but only one case in which McCain actually ""voted to cut education funding,"" as the ad alleges.
 
It came in 1995, when McCain voted for a Republican budget resolution calling for a 1 percent cut in the education budget. In the end, the Education Department's budget was cut slightly that year — in the midst of the budget wars pitting then-President Clinton against the new Republican majority in Congress. But the education budget quickly rebounded and McCain in 2001 voted for the law known as the No Child Left Behind Act, which increased federal education funding by a whopping 33 percent, or $14-billion, in a single year.
 
The McCain campaign in response to the ad's allegations noted a number of other occasions in which McCain has supported increased education funding. It's true that Democrats have supported large funding increases beyond what Republicans have backed, but the Education Department budget today is still 60 percent higher than when Bush took office, increases that have largely enjoyed McCain's backing.
 
Obama again cherry picks the record to make a case that McCain opposes accountability standards. The Obama campaign cites a number of pre-No Child Left Behind votes in which McCain didn't support Democratic efforts to require states to establish accountability standards as a condition of federal funding. Many Republicans long opposed such conditions as a federal imposition on what is traditionally a state responsibility: education. It wasn't accountability standards that they opposed, rather federal intrusion into state responsibilities.
 
Even so, when Bush proposed just that idea in 2001, Republicans, including McCain, voted to create the most rigorous education accountability standards ever imposed by the federal government on the states through the No Child Left Behind Act.
 
Given the McCain campaign's pledge to fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act, and in that way endorse the expanded federal role in education that law calls for, it seems unlikely McCain has any intention of abolishing the Department of Education should he be elected.
 
But for what it's worth, he did way back in 1994, when he said on CNN's

Late Edition

that ""given the origins of the Department of Education, I would favor doing away with it.""
 
There's evidence, then, for each of Obama's charges, but entirely absent is the larger context. Obama is citing exceptions in the McCain record rather than the rule, and claims — erroneously — that failing to support the large increases in education funding backed by Democrats is the same as supporting cuts. As a result, we find the Obama campaign ad's claims to be Barely True.

The wireless revolution would have come anyway
","
Considering Sen. John McCain’s admissions that he is computer “illiterate,” that he has only recently begun to learn how to surf the Net and that he never e-mails, the comment (joke?) from one of his chief advisers made for some snarky blogosphere chatter.
 
A reporter on Sept. 16 asked McCain’s top economic adviser what McCain did as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee that helped him understand financial markets.
 
“He did this,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, holding up his BlackBerry, the ubiquitous handheld wireless device that serves as a mobile phone but also allows users to e-mail, text message and browse the Web. “Telecommunications of the United States is a premier innovation in the past 15 years, comes right through the Commerce Committee so you’re looking at the miracle John McCain helped create and that’s what he did.”
 
Was he saying McCain invented the Blackberry, or merely helped clear away government hurdles to innovation that allowed for Blackberry-like ideas to flourish? It didn’t take long for the political blogs to reach their own conclusion on that question and snort with Al Gore-invented-the-Internet references.
 
The Obama campaign gleefully piled on as well.
 
“If John McCain hadn’t said that ‘the fundamentals of our economy are strong’ on the day of one of our nation’s worst financial crises, the claim that he invented the BlackBerry would have been the most preposterous thing said all week,” said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton.
 
Even McCain laughed when told of Holtz-Eakin’s comment, according to senior aide Matt McDonald.
 
“He would not claim to be the inventor of anything, much less the BlackBerry. This was obviously a boneheaded joke by a staffer,” McDonald said.
 
For the record, Gore never actually claimed to have invented the Internet either.
 
We’re just not going to take seriously any suggestion that McCain actually helped create the BlackBerry. It’s absurd. The BlackBerry was developed by a Canadian company, Research in Motion, and released in 2002.
 
But there is a real issue here, and that’s what McCain did, or did not do, as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee that might be said to have fostered the growth of the wireless industry. McCain served as chairman of the committee from 1997 to 2001 and again from 2003 to 2005.
 
According to an AP account of his remarks, Holtz-Eakin said McCain’s handling of regulation and deregulation of the telecommunications industry in particular left him with the skills to help revive the economy amid a mortgage crisis, an energy crisis and a Wall Street meltdown.
 
By far the most important piece of legislation that emerged from McCain’s tenure on the Commerce Committee was the landmark Telecommunications Act of 1996, the first major overhaul of telecommunications laws since the New Deal. ""The goal of this new law,"" according to an FCC Web site, ""is to let anyone enter any communications business – to let any communications business compete in any market against any other.""
 
The act became law a year before McCain was chairman of the committee, though he was a member. And McCain opposed it and voted against it, arguing that it didn’t go far enough to deregulate the industry. As a result, he argued, it would not create the promised competition and lower prices to consumers.
 
As far as the wireless industry is concerned, perhaps the other most significant government decision was to begin auctioning the airwaves to allow companies to spread wireless communications networks for telephones and computers around the country. Those auctions began in 1994. Again, McCain wasn’t yet the chairman, and he was not the major player driving the auctions. In fact, he voted against the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 that included provisions for the wireless spectrum auctions.
 
The Commerce Committee oversees a wide array of interests: everything from the Coast Guard to communications to interstate commerce; science, engineering, and technology research and development; sports; transportation; and regulation of interstate common carriers, including railroads, buses, trucks, vessels, pipelines and civil aviation.
 
The McCain campaign didn't respond to requests from PolitiFact for details on McCain's role in telecommunications and wireless issues.
 
A February 2000 story in the

Christian Science Monitor

concluded that as for legislative accomplishments as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, ""McCain has chalked up an average list of achievements.
 
""Recently, for example, he has shepherded through bills to limit liability to companies from Y2K-related lawsuits, improve truck and bus safety, protect the privacy of children online, place a moratorium on Internet taxes, and designate a universal 911 emergency number.""
 
In 2004, McCain made headlines when, as chairman of the Commerce Committee, he pushed for stricter steroids policies in professional sports.
 
McCain's appetite for deregulation has by and large made him a friend of the telecommunications industry (witness his campaign contributions), but the wireless revolution largely emerged on its own. Congress acted mainly to regulate or deregulate it, and to sell the airwaves as a public asset. For a chief policy adviser to hold up a BlackBerry and suggest McCain was a major player in fostering its development – even from a regulatory perspective – is more than a stretch.
 
We rule the Holtz-Eakin comment False.

Ringing an alarm, not averting a crisis
","
The turmoil on Wall Street is prompting the presidential candidates to offer prescriptions for restoring order to U.S. financial markets. John McCain is using the opportunity to remind voters that he called on Congress to crack down on government-chartered mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 
Appearing on CNN's

American Morning

on Sept. 16, 2008, McCain sought to blame much of the crisis on Wall Street greed and inept or corrupt government regulators. ""Ask any American citizen who has been the victim of a bureaucrat or a bureaucracy,"" McCain said. ""I said two years ago that the Fannie and Freddie thing was a very serious problem and we had to work on it. And I have always opposed greed of Wall Street and I know how we can fix this.""
 
McCain echoed his remarks later in the day during a speech in Tampa, saying, ""Two years ago, I warned the administration and the Congress that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac needed to be fixed. It turns out, the problem was even bigger. They waited too long, and now we have a housing crisis, three bailouts with taxpayers' money, and a financial crisis.""
 
In both appearances, McCain was referring to his 2006 decision to sign on to a Republican-led regulatory overhaul of the mortgage-financing firms, which both went through multibillion-dollar accounting scandals earlier in the decade. The occasion that prompted McCain's involvement was the release of a 340-page report from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight that concluded that Fannie Mae had manipulated earnings and violated basic accounting principles. It describes an ""arrogant and unethical corporate culture"" in which executives were more concerned about their bonuses than meeting the company's housing mission.
 
The findings, based on a 27-month investigation and resulting in a $400-million fine paid to the government, prompted McCain to join other critics and call for more scrutiny of Fannie and its sibling, Freddie Mac. ""If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole,"" McCain declared in a May 26, 2006, news release.
 
So it's true that McCain spoke out — after a widely read report drew attention to chicanery at the firms. But the implication in McCain's remarks is that his remarks in 2006 were in some way a warning about the financial markets disaster that struck in 2008. That strikes us as quite a stretch.
 
First of all, congressional efforts to increase oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac extend back to the early 1990s, making McCain a latecomer to the debate. The regulatory efforts proved unsuccessful because of Congress' complicated relationship with the firms, whose dominance in the home financing market makes their stability critical to the economy.
 
Fannie and Freddie are government-sponsored enterprises — a type of private corporation created by Congress for an explicit purpose; in this case, to lower the cost of capital in the housing market. Though critics have long maintained that the firms were too large and didn't have enough capital to guard against risk, many lawmakers worried that stricter regulation would interfere with the firms' role in the housing market. (The now-defunct Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, known as OFHEO, oversaw Fannie and Freddie but had limited regulatory authority.)
 
In his appearances, McCain tries to connect the accounting scandals with the broader meltdown in the mortgage markets. But the current crisis arose because banks and mortgage companies made risky ""subprime"" loans to people with poor credit histories that were then packaged into securities and sold to institutional investors. As interest rates rose and home prices began to fall, homeowners unable to refinance the loans or sell their properties began to default, unleashing a cascade effect through financial markets. That phenomenon had nothing to do with Fannie and Freddie's internal problems; in fact, both firms were praised for cushioning the financial free fall and keeping the market afloat by spending billions of dollars to purchase subprime loans.
 
Even if the 2006 effort to strengthen oversight had succeeded, it's debatable whether it would have averted the subprime crisis. The extent of the problems was not yet fully known, and it's a leap of faith to suggest that regulators granted expanded power would have noticed a deterioration in Fannie and Freddie's loan portfolios soon enough, and would have sounded an alarm. Shaken by the extent of the subprime crisis, Congress and the Bush administration earlier this year completed a regulatory overhaul by combining OFHEO and the Federal Housing Finance Board into a new regulatory body, the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Last weekend, the government took the additional step of placing the two firms into conservatorship — essentially a government takeover in which Treasury will extend up to $200-billion of support to the companies.
 
Barack Obama's campaign responded to McCain's remarks by labeling his desire for tougher oversight a myth. Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor noted that McCain in 1992 voted against imposing stricter controls on Fannie and Freddie during Senate debate on a broader housing bill, and this year argued against providing big government bailouts in response to the crisis, whether for big lenders or homeowners.
 
We give McCain some credit for weighing in on problems surrounding Fannie Mae, even though he got involved after a comprehensive government report issued a loud alarm to anyone watching. However, his attempts to depict those efforts as some sort of early warning that could have lessened the current credit crisis just don't wash. All McCain was talking about then was the potential fallout of accounting troubles in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He didn't say anything about a freewheeling climate among creditors that had major financial institutions becoming badly leveraged on bad loans. We rule his claim Barely True.

Former adviser supported deregulation
","With a plummeting stock market grabbing headlines, Barack Obama attacked John McCain's economic philosophy in a speech in Elko, Nev.
 
Obama mocked McCain for saying that he would shake up Washington and get rid of the ""old boys network.""
 
""I mean, where is he getting these lines? The lobbyists running his campaign?"" Obama asked. ""Maybe it's Phil Gramm – the man who was the architect of some of the deregulation in Washington that helped cause the mess on Wall Street, who also happens to be the architect of John McCain's economic plan and one of his chief advisers. You remember Phil Gramm – he's the guy who said that we were just going through a 'mental recession' and who called the United States of America a 'nation of whiners.'""
 
We should stipulate from the start that Phil Gramm might view the title ""architect of deregulation"" as a compliment, though he might prefer the title ""architect of regulatory efficiency.""
 
Gramm gave an interview to the

Wall Street Journal

editorial page, published on June 28, 2008. His biggest worry about Wall Street in the wake of the subprime mortgage meltdown was that it would be regulated more heavily, according to the story.
 
""Every American should worry a lot about this,"" Gramm said. ""We have benefited enormously from New York being the financial capital of the world because we had a more efficient regulatory structure than other nations did.""
 
As a U.S. senator, Gramm promoted two bills that curtailed regulation: The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. Gramm had a prominent role as sponsor and co-sponsor of these bills, respectively.
 
But as we've said in other rulings, it takes more than one person to change a law. These bills had other supporters, and President Bill Clinton signed both into law. It's also worth noting that the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have frowned on increased regulation in the years since those laws were passed. So don't give Gramm all the credit.
 
Did deregulation ""help cause"" the disaster on Wall Street? The carnage is still being autopsied, but most Wall Street watchers agree that light regulation allowed irresponsible lending and mortgage fraud to go unchecked. The Commodity Futures Modernization Act in particular has been singled out for spurring the growth of poorly understood, unregulated securities such as credit default swaps, which have been getting a good portion of the blame for the financial crisis of September 2008.
 
Finally, Gramm is no longer a chief adviser to the McCain campaign. He resigned in July 2008 after the ""nation of whiners"" remark that Obama mentions.
 
So let's go over the elements of this statement:
 
""Architect of some of the deregulation"": Not the architect, but fairly described as a key supporter.
 
""That helped cause the mess on Wall Street"": Not the root cause, but a contributing factor. ""Helped"" seems a fair characterization.
 
""One of McCain's chief advisers"": He used to be, but isn't anymore.
 
There's some truth here, but it also seems like Obama is exaggerating to make a point. When you add up all the elements, we rate Obama's statement Half True.

McCain's record on pork: Good, not perfect
","
Sen. John McCain has a well-deserved reputation in Washington as a pork-buster. The GOP presidential nominee regularly castigates colleagues when they insert language in spending bills forcing taxpayers everywhere to pay for projects only of interest to a select few.
 
But we sure wish that McCain would stop claiming, as he has repeatedly throughout the campaign, that he has never sought any pork for his own state. The latest instance is in a speech he made in Tampa, Fla., on Sept. 16, 2008. He said:
 
""I have never asked for a single earmark, pork barrel project for my state of Arizona. Sen. Obama has asked for $932-million dollars in earmarks, literally $1-million for every day that he's been in Congress."" We examined the claim he's making about Barack Obama's record in another item

here.

In this one, we'll look at what McCain is boasting about himself. It echoes a point McCain made in a mailer being distributed in Florida in which McCain claims to have ""never sought a single dollar"" in pork barrel funding.
 
It's just not true. As PolitiFact writer John Frank pointed out earlier this year, McCain in 2006 co-sponsored legislation that asked for $10-million for an academic center at the University of Arizona to honor the late Supreme Court chief justice William Rehnquist. In 2003, Frank noted, McCain won authorization to buy property to create a buffer zone around Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, and in 1992, McCain asked the Environmental Protection Agency to provide $5-million toward a wastewater project in Nogales, Ariz.
 
While McCain would surely say these projects don't meet the definition of pork barrel spending, watchdogs disagree. ""If it doesn't meet the technical term of earmark, it would probably meet the public idea of one,"" Pete Sepp, a vice president at the conservative, anti-pork National Taxpayers Union, told the

New York Times

in reference to the Rehnquist center request.
 
By most senators' standards, McCain's pork barrel requests are minuscule, but they do exist. And given the absolutism in McCain's claim, we rule his statement False.

McCain said he had confidence in Paulson
","
Barack Obama promoted his record on the economy and attacked John McCain's policies in a speech in Golden, Colo., on Sept. 16, 2008, the day after the stock market reeled on news of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.
 
""Last September, I stood up at Nasdaq and said it's time to realize that we are in this together — that there is no dividing line between Wall Street and Main Street — and warned of a growing loss of trust in our capital markets,"" Obama said. ""Months later, Sen. McCain told a newspaper that he'd love to give them a solution to the mortgage crisis, 'but' — he said — 'I don't know one.'""
 
Obama did give

a speech

at Nasdaq on Sept. 17, 2007, in which he talked about the mortgage crisis and how it could affect both homeowners and Wall Street. He proposed several ways that the government could regulate markets more effectively. So that part of his statement is true.
 
We wanted to know if McCain said that he ""didn't know"" of a solution to the mortgage crisis, as Obama said, and to see if McCain's remarks were taken in context.
 
The source for that claim is a videotaped interview McCain gave to the

Keene

(N.H.)

Sentinel

on Dec. 4, 2007.
 
In McCain's defense, it should be noted that at that time, the larger topic of debate was how to help homeowners losing their homes to foreclosure. The crisis in the financial industry then was a lesser, though still serious, concern. When McCain was speaking with the

Sentinel

board, the collapse of the investment bank Bear Stearns was still more than four months in the future.
 
In the interview, McCain disparaged speculators who contributed to bad loans, but his comments focused on how to help homeowners meet their house payments and stay out of foreclosure. McCain specifically mentioned creating a simplified form for mortgages so loan applicants could more easily understand the terms of their mortgages.
 
""In an ideal world, we'd have enough people to go case-by-case and say, okay, you can go back to your previous interest rate, and you can't,"" McCain said. ""But, my God, we're talking about hundreds of thousands, if not millions (of homeowners) and how long would that take? Meanwhile, people are suffering very badly.""
 
""I don't know how bad it's going to get, and obviously the worse it gets, then, the more there is a role for goverment,"" McCain added. ""But I can't come down yet and give you a specific solution, because I don't claim to be smart enough, but I do have some confidence in (Treasury Secretary Henry) Paulson and I'm glad to see him more and more active in this issue. I'd love to give you a solution, but I don't know.""
 
He also said he he relies on his advisers and other ""smart people"" to keep him up to speed on economic matters.
 
Let's stipulate that this interview does not showcase McCain at his best on issues of the economy and finance. But Obama's statement that McCain said he ""didn't know"" of a solution to the mortgage crisis appears to be accurate given the full context of the interview. We rate Obama's statement True.

McCain's got Obama over a pork barrel
","
John McCain has tried to bolster his reformist credentials throughout the campaign by reminding voters that he has long been a crusader against pork barrel spending – federal money for parochial projects in particular states. At the same time, he's derided Democratic nominee Barack Obama for taking no similar stand.
 
McCain contends that pork spending, which is typically earmarked quietly into massive federal spending bills, forces costs onto every taxpayer that should be borne only by the people who benefit from the projects.
 
The latest broadside by McCain against Obama came in a speech at a rally in Tampa, Fla., on Sept. 16, 2008.
 
“I have never asked for a single earmark, pork barrel project for my state of Arizona. Sen. Obama has asked for $932-million dollars in earmarks, literally $1-million for every day that he’s been in Congress.”
 
We've examined the first part of that sentence, about McCain's own record on pork requests,

here.

In this item, we'll focus on what he says about Obama, which is nearly identical to what McCain said in a mailer to Florida voters that has been circulating for more than a week.
 
The mailer says, ""Obama has requested $1-million in pork barrel spending for every working day he has been in the Senate.""
 
Obama, on his Web site, has listed every earmark he's requested – but not necessarily received – during that time. It totals $931.3-million, even though the Illinois senator earlier this year said he would eschew any pork for fiscal 2009. The key phrase in McCain's mailer, ""for every working day"" is missing from the remarks McCain made in his Tampa speech. Obama was elected in 2004 and took office January 3, 2005. Since then, there have been about 930 working days, as they are defined by most people, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, which would mean McCain is on solid ground in the mailer.
 
Technically, Obama's been ""in Congress"" for more than 1,350 days, if you count weekends. So how many points do you take off for McCain not saying ""every

working

day""? Not many. We say this claim is Mostly True.

There is no agreement to build, and it's not $40-billion
","
In her early campaign appearances, Gov. Sarah Palin has repeatedly boasted about her role in advocating a new natural gas pipeline in Alaska.
 
And she has not always stuck to the truth, as we explain

in a story here

.
 
This is her at a campaign appearance in Fairfax, Va., on Sept. 10, 2008: ""I'm ready to join John McCain in Washington so we can end the corrupt practices of the abuse of earmarks once and for all. We'll do that. Through competition as governor, I got agreements to build a nearly $40-billion natural gas pipeline. That's going to help all of you.""
 
A commitment to build new natural gas pipeline from Alaska's remote but resource-rich North Slope would indeed be quite an accomplishment. Alaskans have been seeking it for some three decades.
 
As Palin campaigned for governor, she sharply criticized her predecessor's plan to have major oil companies build the pipeline. After she was elected governor, she sought competing proposals. In August 2008, the Legislature accepted one from TransCanada Corp., a Calgary-based company.
 
Under a plan Palin spearheaded, TransCanada will get $500-million in state funds to design and seek approvals for the pipeline. But they are not obligated to build it. Financing and approvals are far from certain, and the company can back out even if those contingencies come through.
 
Several experts we spoke to were skeptical that TransCanada's plan would come to fruition.
 
""I'll believe it when I see it,"" said Sarah Ladislaw, a fellow specializing in Western Hemispheric energy issues at the Center for Strategic & International Studies.
 
Palin has repeatedly mischaracterized the agreement with TransCanada. In a news conference in Alaska on Aug. 1, 2008, she said the state never before had ""commitments to build this line. Now we do.""
 
In its news story the next day, the

Anchorage Daily News

wrote: ""That's incorrect. TransCanada has not promised to actually build the gas line, one of the state's grandest and most frustrated economic development dreams. The state license ... is not a construction contract and does not guarantee a pipeline will be built. Rather, it's an exclusive deal under which the state will provide up to $500-million plus other incentives, such as a coordinator to speed up permits, in exchange for TransCanada doing its best to secure the customers, financing, and U.S. and Canadian regulatory clearances.""
 
Palin also frequently says the pipeline would cost ""nearly $40-billion,"" as she did in this claim. We're not sure where she got that figure — neither her office in Alaska nor the McCain campaign returned our calls to tell us. TransCanada estimates the cost at $26-billion.
 
Yes, there could be cost overruns. But experts were skeptical the price could reach Palin's estimate.
 
Palin's accomplishment sounds impressive in her words — far more than it actually is. The agreement she reached — with the help of the Alaska State Legislature — is not a commitment to build, but rather a commitment to begin planning the massive project. Palin's claim suggests that construction is assured, but that's just not true. And if it were, it wouldn't be a $40-billion pipeline. Those are two significant flaws in this claim Palin makes repeatedly.
 
Still, there is a new agreement that was forged with Palin as governor, so we rate her boast as Barely True.

Not quite the largest, and not quite ""brought about""
","
Since Sen. John McCain named Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin his vice-presidential running mate, she has repeatedly touted her push for a new pipeline in Alaska as evidence of her executive experience and energy expertise.
 
But she has often fudged the truth in the process, as we explain in

this article

.
 
Here we'll look at a claim Palin made both in her speech at the Republican National Convention on Sept. 3, 2008, and in a radio address three days later. Here's the full context, from the radio address:
 
""Despite fierce opposition from oil company lobbyists, we broke their monopoly on power and resources,"" Palin said. ""As governor, I insisted on competition and basic fairness to end their control of our state and return it to the people. I fought to bring about the largest private-sector infrastructure project in North American history. And when that deal was struck, we began a nearly $40-billion natural gas pipeline to help lead America to energy independence.""
 
The pipeline, which has been a pipe dream (pardon us) of officials and oilmen in Alaska for three decades, would carry to market natural gas currently stranded under the state's remote and rugged North Slope. Palin's plan is for the Canadian company TransCanada Corp. to build a 1,715-mile line southeast along the Alaska Highway, through the Canadian province of British Columbia to a hub in Alberta.
 
Before her election as governor, Palin opposed the idea of routing the pipeline through Canada, a version of which her predecessor, Frank Murkowski, had advocated. But after she was elected governor she decided to consider all options.
 
She pushed the Legislature to pass a law providing $500-million in state funds to whatever company presented the best proposal for the project. The Legislature accepted TransCanada's proposal in August 2008, and the company now faces the multiyear process of seeking federal approval.
 
So yes, Palin ""fought to bring about"" a new plan for the pipeline. (Though she also fought to put the kibosh on Murkowski's plan.)
 
Her phrasing — ""fought to bring about"" — could suggest that she

did

bring about the pipeline — that is, that it has been built, or is at least under construction. That's not true — TransCanada does not plan to begin construction until 2015, if at all.
 
Now, would the pipeline be ""the largest private-sector infrastructure project in North American history""?
 
Palin didn't specify what she meant by ""largest,"" but according to engineering experts, cost is the most common measure of the size of large-scale projects. ""Generally when people talk about the size of an infrastructure project they're talking about the cost,"" said Jay McCauley, vice president of the Society for Industrial Archeology.
 
We talked to several experts in pipelines and large-scale engineering projects, who said the only private infrastructure project on the scale of Palin's proposed pipeline that they could come up with was the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, an oil pipeline also from the North Slope that is often referred to as the Alaska Pipeline. (Most large infrastructure projects are publicly funded, whether directly, like the Interstate Highway System, or indirectly, like the Transcontinental Railroad.)
 
The Alaska Pipeline was completed in 1977

at a cost of $8-billion.

At 800 miles, it is physically shorter than TransCanada's proposed pipeline, but its $8-billion price tag would be at least $27-billion in 2007 dollars, according to the three

online


inflation


calculators

we consulted.
 
Palin has claimed repeatedly that TransCanada's pipeline would cost ""nearly $40-billion."" But we could not determine where that estimate came from, and neither Palin's office in Alaska nor the McCain campaign returned our calls to tell us. Alaska's Web site says TransCanada's project would cost about $26-billion, and TransCanada spokeswoman Cecily Dobson confirmed the cost estimate remains ""approximately US$26-billion in 2007 dollars.""
 
That's less than the $27-billion inflation-adjusted cost of the Alaska Pipeline. Not by much — but it's less.
 
Palin was right to say she ""fought to bring about"" the pipeline. But she implies that it's further along than it really is.

McCain supported Republican-backed investigation
","In a speech hammering the theme that Sen. John McCain would not offer much change from the last eight years under President George W. Bush, Sen. Joe Biden hit on what many consider a low point of the Bush presidency: the federal government's slow response to Hurricane Katrina. ""When George Bush said we shouldn't investigate why the government's response to Hurricane Katrina was so incompetent, John McCain stood with him,"" Biden said in a speech in St. Clair Shores, Mich., on Sept. 15, 2008. It's true that McCain joined other Republicans in the Senate to fend off Democratic efforts led by Sen. Hillary Clinton to create an independent commission to examine the federal, state and local response to Hurricane Katrina. On Sept. 14, 2005, McCain and 53 other Senate Republicans rejected an effort by Clinton to establish the commission by attaching an amendment to a spending bill. Republicans said the move violated Senate rules by attempting to legislate policy via a spending bill. Less than five months later, on Feb. 2, 2006, McCain joined with 52 Senate Republicans in a vote to kill a Clinton effort to attach a similar amendment to a tax bill. Both votes came down entirely along partisan lines. And they came at a time of particularly bitter recriminations over the federal response to Hurricane Katrina, while the White House was refusing to release certain documents or to make senior officials available for sworn testimony before Congress, citing the confidentiality of executive branch communications. But it's misleading to suggest that McCain opposed all efforts to investigate the government's response to Katrina. Republicans in the GOP-controlled Senate threw their support behind a probe by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which looked into the federal role in hurricane preparedness and its response. Republican leaders expressed faith in the bipartisan investigation and derided Democratic efforts to charter an independent commission to conduct a parallel inquiry. An aide to then-Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., called amendments to establish an independent Katrina commission ""taxpayer-funded flatulence that would just waste time and money to distract from the inquiry already well under way in the Senate."" And Republicans did offer to create a bipartisan congressional committee consisting of senators and representatives to examine the hurricane response. But Democrats took a pass, saying it wouldn't be truly bipartisan because as minority party they wouldn't have subpoena power. Biden is correct that McCain did not support the Democratic plan to create an independent commission to investigate the government's response to Katrina. But McCain didn't oppose all investigation. He supported the Homeland Security investigation. It may not have been the kind of investigation the Democrats wanted. It may not have had the independence Democrats wanted. But it was an investigation. And so we rate Biden's statement Half True.  ",/factchecks/2008/sep/15/joe-biden/mccain-supported-republican-backed-investigation/
"['National', 'Religion', 'Sarah Palin']","
Not far from Lincoln's sentiment
","In her first major news interview since being named the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party, Sarah Palin answered questions about comments she had made about ""God's plan"" and Iraq.
 
The questioner was ABC News' Charles Gibson. Gibson asked her, ""You said recently in your old church, 'Our national leaders are sending U.S. soldiers on a task that is from God.' Are we fighting a Holy War?""
 
Palin: ""That's a repeat of Abraham Lincoln's words, when he said, first he suggested, never presume to know what God's will is, and I would never presume to know God's will or to speak God's words, but what Abraham Lincoln had said, and that's a repeat in my comments, was, let us not pray that God is on our side, in a war, or any other time. But let us pray that we are on God's side. That's what that comment was all about, Charlie.""
 
Gibson then followed up: ""But you went on and said, 'There is a plan, and it is God's plan.'""
 
Here's the rest of their exchange:
 
Palin: ""I believe that there is a plan for this world, and that plan for this world is for good. I believe that there is great hope and great potential for every country, to be able to live and be protected within inalienable rights that I believe are God-given, Charlie. And I believe those are the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That in my worldview is the grand plan.""
 
Gibson: ""Then, are you sending your son on a task from God?""
 
Palin: ""I don't know if the task is from God, Charlie. What I know is that my son has made a decision. I am so proud of his independent and strong decision. What he decided to do, in serving for the right reasons in serving something greater than self, and not choosing a real easy path, where he could be more comfortable and certainly safer.""
 
We decided to compare Palin's words and Lincoln's words side-by-side to see if Palin's words were a repeat of Abraham Lincoln's.
 
Palin made the original comments in June 2007 to the Wasilla Assembly of God. Her visit there had been videotaped and posted to the church's Web site. The video has since been removed, but copies are available on the Internet.
 
In the video, Palin is speaking informally to a group of students, talking about her family and discussing current events. She offers quotes from the Bible at times, and also makes enthusiastic, casual comments, at one point joking that the students are ""a cool-looking bunch of Christians.""
 
""My oldest, my son Track, is a soldier in the United States Army now. ... Pray for our military. He's going to be deployed in September to Iraq. Pray for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right. Also, for this country, that our leaders, our national leaders, are sending them out on a task that is from God. That's what we have to make sure that we're praying for, that there is a plan and that that plan is God's plan.""
 
We think it's important to note that Palin is asking the audience to ""pray for"" military men and women, and that national leaders are sending troops out ""on a task that is from God."" She even repeats ""that's what we have to make sure that we're praying for."" Gibson doesn't mention the words ""pray for"" when he questions her. Praying for something implies that you don't yet have it or that it there is some uncertainty, so it seems logical that Palin is expressing a hope that something is true, not a certainty.
 
Meanwhile, we tracked down Abraham Lincoln's words on God's will. The original source appears to be a book titled

Six Months in the White House with Abraham Lincoln

, written by Francis B. Carpenter and published in 1867, not long after Lincoln's death.
 
The following is from Page 282 of Carpenter's account:
 
""No nobler reply ever fell from the lips of a ruler, than that uttered by President Lincoln in response to the clergyman who ventured to say, in his presence, that he hoped 'the Lord was on our side.'
 
""'I am not at all concerned about that,' replied Mr. Lincoln, 'for I know that the Lord is always on the side of the right. But it is my constant anxiety and prayer that I and this nation should be on the Lord's side.'""
 
In fairness, Lincoln's words do seem to express a greater degree of anxiety about being on God's side than Palin's. Lincoln is also rebuking a clergyman's inflated sense of moral piety, while Palin appears to be expressing solidarity with fellow believers. But Gibson's truncation of her comments — omitting the crucial words ""pray for"" — change the meaning of her comments from a wish to a certainty. Palin's and Lincoln's words are similar in that they both express a hope that a plan meets with God's favor. Granted, some people find any mention of God's will and warfare to be disturbing. But we find similarities between the two sets of comments. We find Palin's statement Mostly True.

Earlier, she didn't ""attribute it to being man-made""
","In her first major news interview since being named the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party, Sarah Palin answered questions from journalist Charles Gibson about her thoughts on climate change. Gibson prefaced his question by saying that Palin, before being selected for the ticket, had said global warming was not caused by human activities. That would conflict with the views of her running mate John McCain. ""Do you still believe that global warming is not man-made?"" Gibson asked. ""I believe that man's activities certainly can be contributing to the issue of global warming, climate change,"" Palin said. ""Regardless of that, John McCain and I agree that we gotta do something about it, and we have to make sure that we're doing all we can to cut down on pollution. ... After a followup question, she said: ""I'm attributing some of man's activities to potentially causing some of the changes in the climate right now."" Gibson said he detected a change in her position, but Palin said she hadn't. ""Show me where I've ever said that there's absolute proof that nothing that man has ever conducted or engaged in has had any effect or no effect on climate change. I have not said that. I have said that my belief is there is a cyclical nature of our planet — warming trends, cooling trends."" We looked for Palin's previous statements on global warming. Earlier this year, she gave an interview to the Web site Newsmax, which ran the following brief exchange with Palin. Question: ""What is your take on global warming and how is it affecting our country?"" Palin: ""A changing environment will affect Alaska more than any other state, because of our location. I'm not one though who would attribute it to being man-made."" She also gave an interview to a Fairbanks newspaper in December 2007, discussing her first year as governor. The story states: ""A few months into her term, Palin directed a group of state commissioners to develop a strategy for addressing climate change. State lawmakers had already formed a climate commission, but the administration up until then had nothing. ""'I'm not an Al Gore, doom-and-gloom environmentalist blaming the changes in our climate on human activity,' Palin said Monday, 'but I'm not going to put my head in the sand and pretend there aren't changes.'"" Those are two clear statements that Palin didn't believe that human activity contributed to global warming. She agreed that global warming was real but implied that it had non-human causes. In her interview with Gibson, she said that ""man's activities certainly can be contributing."" We rule this one a Full Flop.  ",/factchecks/2008/sep/12/sarah-palin/earlier-she-didnt-attribute-it-to-being-man-made/
"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Barack Obama']","
McCain is not computer savvy
","The latest ad from Barack Obama's campaign, called

Still

, sets the clock back to John McCain's first year as a congressman.
 
The ad begins with 1982 on the screen, a disco ball in the background.
 
""1982,"" the announcer says. ""John McCain goes to Washington.""
 
The screen flashes a picture of the freshman legislator in large, dated glasses.
 
""Things have changed in the last 26 years. But McCain hasn't.""
 
Images flash of a record player and a Rubik's Cube.
 
""He admits he still doesn't know how to use a computer, can't send an e-mail. Still doesn't understand the economy, and favors $200-billion in new tax cuts for corporations, but almost nothing for the middle class.""
 
The suggestion is clear: McCain is out of touch. We looked at a claim about whether McCain has said he doesn't understand the economy, when then-Republican primary opponent Mitt Romney brought it up. See our ruling

here

. We've also looked at whether McCain would offer any tax relief to

middle class people

.
Here, we will look at the claims about McCain's computer acumen.
 
In an interview for Yahoo News in January, Mike Allen, chief political correspondent for

Politico

, a Washington-based newspaper, asked several Republican candidates at the time whether they prefer a Mac or a PC.
 
""Neither,"" McCain replied. ""I am an illiterate that has to rely on my wife for all of the assistance that I can get.""
 
In a July 11 interview with the

New York Times,

McCain hardly sounded like he has since gone techie.
 
In answer to a question about what Web sites he looks at regularly, McCain said aides ""show me"" the Drudge Report, Politico.com and sometimes Real Clear Politics. He also noted that he reads the blog written by his daughter, Meagan.
 
""But do you go online for yourself?"" McCain was asked.
 
""They go on for me,"" McCain said. ""I am learning to get online myself, and I will have that down fairly soon, getting on myself. I don't expect to be a great communicator, I don't expect to set up my own blog, but I am becoming computer literate to the point where I can get the information that I need — including going to my daughter's blog first, before anything else.""
 
""Do you use a blackberry or e-mail?""
 
""No,"" McCain said, but then explained. ""I use the Blackberry, but I don't e-mail, I've never felt the particular need to e-mail. I read e-mails all the time, but the communications that I have with my friends and staff are oral and done with my cell phone. I have the luxury of being in contact with them literally all the time. We now have a phone on the plane that is usable on the plane, so I just never really felt a need to do it. But I do — could I just say, really — I understand the impact of blogs on American politics today and political campaigns. I understand that. And I understand that something appears on one blog, can ricochet all around and get into the evening news, the front page of the

New York Times.

So, I do pay attention to the blogs. And I am not in any way unappreciative of the impact that they have on entire campaigns and world opinion.""
 
Although McCain has never blamed injuries suffered as a Vietnam POW for his lack of computer skills, articles in the Boston Globe and Forbes in 2000 noted that those injuries make it difficult for him to use a keyboard.
 
According to Forbes: ""McCain is an inveterate devotee of email. His nightly ritual is to read his email together with his wife, Cindy. The injuries he incurred as a Vietnam POW make it painful for McCain to type. Instead, he dictates responses that his wife types on a laptop. 'She's a whiz on the keyboard, and I'm so laborious,' McCain admits.""
 
Still, McCain admits that he just isn't much of a technology user.
 
Two years ago, McCain told CNN, ""I read my e-mails, but I don't write any. I'm a Neanderthal--I don't even type. I do have rudimentary capabilities to call up some websites, like the New York Times online, that sort of stuff. No laptop. No PalmPilot. I prefer my schedule on notecards, which I keep in my jacket pocket.""
 
The Obama campaign ad says McCain ""can't send an e-mail."" That seems to paint McCain as a bit more out of touch than he is. He does own a Blackberry and he says he regularly gets and reads e-mails. McCain admits he doesn't send them, but never said he can't.
 
And it sounds like McCain is at least starting to dabble on the Web. But as of July, not without help. Unless McCain has boned up in the past couple months, if he is reading this post, we assume someone else navigated to the page and showed it to him. One can argue how relevant this is to McCain's ability to lead the country, but even according to McCain, he is not very computer savvy. We rule the claim in the ad Mostly True.
 
Update: On Sept. 15, 2008, we updated this story with information about how injuries sustained by McCain as a POW make it difficult for him to use a keyboard. However, given McCain's acknowledgment that he is learning to get online, this additional information did not change our ruling.
