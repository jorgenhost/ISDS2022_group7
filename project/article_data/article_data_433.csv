Donald Trump says Chicago has experienced thousands of shootings this year
","Lester Holt asked the major presidential candidates in their first debate how they would heal the nation’s racial divide, exacerbated by police shootings of unarmed African-Americans. Democrat Hillary Clinton called for a top-to-bottom re-examination of the criminal justice system to prevent uneven treatment of minorities under the law. Republican Donald Trump, stuck to his ""law and order"" approach, painting a bleak portrait of life for African-Americans and Hispanics ""living in hell because it’s so dangerous."" He zeroed in on Chicago, President Barack Obama’s hometown. ""In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since Jan. 1. Thousands of shootings,"" Trump said. Has Chicago had thousands of shootings so far this year? Trump’s campaign showed us an article published on Forbes Sept. 8 that says of Chicago, ""In 2015, 2,988 people were shot and 2016′s figure already stands at 2,949."" The Chicago Tribune, which tracks neighborhood crimes through its Crime in Chicagoland project, has data supporting that shooting count for 2015. And as far as this year goes? From Jan. 1 to Sept. 26, there have been 3,210 shooting victims, according to the Chicago Tribune. The publication says the data it compiles is not the same as what the city offers, so numbers will not match those tracked by the city. ""One shooting incident may have multiple victims, but it still counts officially as only one shooting,"" the Chicago Tribune site says. Even then, data released by the Chicago Police Department also shows there have been 2,521 shooting incidents in the city up to Sept. 18. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel delivered a speech Sept. 22 addressing high levels of crime in his city and ways to combat it, outlining a need for more policing, more jobs and crime prevention. ""Gun violence in Chicago is unacceptable. ... It is pulling us apart at the very moment that our city needs us to come together,"" Emanuel said, according to the Tribune. ""For all the things that make Chicago great, for all the things that make us proud to call ourselves Chicagoans, the violence that is happening corrodes our core. It is not the Chicago we know, and it is not the Chicago we love."" While the number of shooting victims so far this year have surpassed 2015, it’s important to note that they do not represent homicides, experts told us. (However, the Tribune’s count of 550 homicides so far in 2016 also outnumbers the 2015 tally of 492 homicides.) ""The word ‘shooting’ does not distinguish based on severity of the wound or the type of crime,"" said Adam Lankford, a criminology professor at the University of Alabama. Shooting statistics also include people who shot themselves by mistake. A shooting is simply a gun being fired, not someone being shot or killed, said Dewey Cornell, director of the Virginia Youth Violence Project at the University of Virginia. The city’s numbers are striking, but Cornell said violent crime in Chicago is much lower than it was 20 years ago, mirroring the national trend. When you have a flare-up in gang warfare in any community, there will be large increases in gun homicides, and Chicago has for more than a century had a gang problem that is much greater than other cities like New York, Cornell said. ""There has been an increase in gun violence in Chicago in recent years, but Chicago does not represent the U.S. and is atypical of other large cities, so it does not make sense to use Chicago as an example to understand crime in the U.S.,"" Cornell added. A plausible explanation for the rise in shootings in Chicago is that gangs have been displaced from their former turf by the demolition of some housing projects, said George A. Mocsary, an assistant professor at Southern Illinois University School of Law. ""Violence has ensued as the displaced gang members try to move into new territory claimed by other gangs,"" Mocsary said. Our ruling Trump said, ""In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings."" There have been more than 3,000 shooting victims in Chicago so far this year, according to media reports and gun violence experts. The count of shootings includes all types of shootings, including shootings of more than one person and on accident, and it should not be taken as a substitute for ""homicides.""

At first debate, Donald Trump claims, again, that he was against war in Iraq
","Donald Trump says it’s ""mainstream media nonsense"" when reporters push back on his repeated claims that he opposed the Iraq War prior to the 2003 invasion. At the Sept. 26 presidential debate in Hempstead, N.Y., moderator Lester Holt posed to Trump that he ""had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion."" ""I did not support the war in Iraq,"" he said, interrupting Holt. ""The record shows that I’m right."" The challenge with Trump’s claim is that we can’t go back in time and get inside his head, so we’ll never know what his private thoughts were. However, one thing is clear: The record does not prove him right. Trump has trouble getting past a September 2002 interview with shock jock Howard Stern. Stern asked Trump if he supported the looming invasion. Trump responded, ""Yeah, I guess so."" At the debate, Trump said he made these comments to Stern ""very lightly."" Trump then noted another interview he did in January 2003, a few months before the invasion. Fox News’ Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President George W. Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy. ""Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know,"" Trump said. ""He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned."" So Trump put the economy ahead of confronting Iraq, but he didn’t speak against going to war. At most he suggested waiting for the United Nations to do something. A week after the United States invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003, Trump gave different takes. At an Academy Awards after-party, Trump said that ""the war’s a mess,"" according to the Washington Post. He told Fox News that because of the war, ""The market’s going to go up like a rocket."" Throughout 2003, Trump complained about the cost of the Iraq War and its effect on the economy. The earliest evidence of Trump’s outright opposition to the war didn’t come until an August 2004 article in Esquire, more than a year after the war started: ""Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way,"" Trump said. Trump has been challenged many times in this election to explain his early acceptance of the war. In a February 2016 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, Trump said that he didn’t know what he meant during his 2002 conversation with Stern. ""That was a long time ago, and who knows what was in my head."" Trump said. At the Sept. 26 debate, Trump also said he had many debates with Fox host and Trump supporter Sean Hannity prior to the Iraq invasion — in which Trump opposed the invasion, and Hannity supported it. However, they didn’t have these debates on the air so we have no record of them. Hannity has said this is ""100 percent true."" Our ruling Trump said, ""I did not support the war in Iraq … The record shows that I’m right."" The record does not support Trump’s repeated assertions that he opposed the war prior to the 2003 invasion. Around the time of the invasion, Trump’s comments were few and far between, not to mention vague. In 2002, asked if America should go to war, he said, ""I guess so."" Less than three months before the invasion, Trump said the president should be more focused on the economy, but he didn’t specifically speak against launching an attack. He didn’t voice full-throated opposition until almost a year and a half after the invasion.

Hillary Clinton claims Donald Trump invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to hack Americans
","Hillary Clinton said that Donald Trump gave Russian president Vladimir Putin the thumbs up to hack away at U.S. emails. Putin has ""let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee,"" Clinton said during the first general election presidential debate at Hofstra University. She continued: ""But we will defend the citizens of this country, and the Russians need to understand that. I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far will we go? How much will we do? And that's why I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable."" We will fact-check whether Clinton is right about what Trump said about Putin and the emails. Trump’s comments about Russia hacking Clinton’s emails A Clinton campaign spokesman pointed us to Trump’s comments at a press conference at Trump National Doral golf course July 27. ""Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump said to a room full of TV cameras as well as reporters from the Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times. ""I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press."" He also said: ""By the way, they hacked -- they probably have her 33,000 e-mails. I hope they do. They probably have her 33,000 e-mails that she lost and deleted because you'd see some beauties there. So let's see."" Clinton’s lawyers had turned over work-related emails but deleted thousands that she said were about personal matters. FBI Director James Comey said earlier that month that Clinton should have known that some of the emails stored on private servers in her New York home were classified, but concluded there wasn’t enough evidence that she intentionally mishandled classified information. Although the Justice Department declined to prosecute, Trump continued to hammer Clinton for the email controversy: ""That gives me a big problem,"" Trump said in Doral. ""After she gets a subpoena! She gets subpoenaed, and she gets rid of 33,000 emails? That gives me a problem. Now, if Russia or China or any other country has those emails, I mean, to be honest with you, I'd love to see them."" When Katy Tur, an NBC reporter, asked Trump whether he was encouraging a foreign country to hack into emails, Trump snapped back: ""Be quiet. I know you want to save (Clinton)."" Trump also attacked the DNC over thousands of leaked emails published by WikiLeaks in July. Those emails showed its leaders — including party chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz of South Florida — favored Clinton over rival Bernie Sanders. Two days later Wasserman Schultz, a U.S. representative, announced she would step down from her party post. As for any invitation to Russia to hack emails, a Trump campaign spokesman told PolitiFact that Trump said he was being ""sarcastic"" in an interview that Fox News posted the next day. Trump told Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade, ""You have to be kidding. His client, his person, deleted 33,000 emails illegally. You look at that. And when I’m being sarcastic with something ..."" Asked by Kilmeade if he was indeed being sarcastic, Trump snapped, ""Of course I'm being sarcastic."" Our ruling Clinton says Trump ""publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans’ (emails)."" Trump said at a press conference in South Florida that he hoped Russia was able to find ""the 30,000 emails that are missing.""

Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton lauded controversial Trans-Pacific trade deal
","Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump sparred over trade deals past and present in the early moments of their first debate Monday night. Trump has criticized both the North American Free Trade Agreement approved under President Bill Clinton and the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiated by President Barack Obama’s administration. Hillary Clinton, of course, was part of the Obama administration as secretary of state, and Trump said she’s culpable for supporting what he said was a bad deal. ""You called it the gold standard,"" Trump said of the agreement, known as TPP. ""You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it’s the finest deal you’ve ever seen."" For her part, Clinton rebutted that she at one time thought it could be the gold standard of trade deals before it was finished negotiated, but became disenchanted once it was finalized. ""I did say I hoped it would be a good deal,"" she said. She similarly defended herself on this point during her primary campaign against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. So what did Clinton say about TPP? Back in 2012 when she was leading the State Department, Clinton was pretty effusive in her support of the deal. While in Australia, Clinton delivered remarks on the general topic of the U.S.-Australia relationship. Here’s everything she said about the TPP in that address, with the ""gold standard"" comment in bold. ""So it's fair to say that our economies are entwined, and we need to keep upping our game both bilaterally and with partners across the region through agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP. Australia is a critical partner. This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment."" At that point, it seems clear Clinton is saying the TPP sets the gold standard. She didn’t say she ""hoped"" it would. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung pointed to this statement in Australia to defend his candidate’s statement. Other comments around the same time echoed similar assuredness that the TPP would meet that high bar. In November 2012 remarks in Singapore, she encouraged all nations ""willing to meet 21st century standards as embodied in the TPP"" to join the deal. ""The so-called TPP will lower barriers, raise standards, and drive long-term growth across the region. It will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and establish strong protections for workers and the environment,"" she said, adding that it would result in better jobs with better wages and working conditions. She did not say it was ""the finest deal"" she’d ever seen. But here are some of the other words Clinton used to describe the TPP before she left the State Department in 2013: ""exciting,"" ""innovative,"" ""ambitious,"" ""groundbreaking,"" ""cutting-edge,"" ""high-quality"" and ""high standard."" Now, at that point, the deal was still being negotiated. And even before it was finalized, she started to temper her expectations for the deal as the campaign drew near. Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin pointed to this passage in her 2014 memoir Hard Choices: ""Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing, it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement. It’s safe to say the TPP won’t be perfect -- no deal negotiated among a dozen countries ever will be -- but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers."" More recently, after the deal was finalized last year and presented for Congress to approve, Clinton changed her position and now says she opposes it. In the past when asked about her wording, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill noted that the ""gold standard"" comment was made during negotiations and because they were conducted in secret, we don’t know if the final deal is dramatically different than it was in 2012. It’s worth pointing out, too, that as secretary of state, she spoke as a representative of the Obama administration, which was and remains wholeheartedly in favor of the deal. Our ruling Trump said Clinton called the Trans-Pacific Partnership the ""gold standard"" of trade deals. Clinton did use that language in 2012 when discussing TPP in Australia. And unlike her rebuttal, she didn’t couch it by saying she ""hoped"" it would be the gold standard. It’s worth noting that at this point the deal was still under negotiation and because that was done behind closed doors, there’s no way to know how much it changed. Before the final version came out, she advocated more of a wait-and-see approach.

Hillary Clinton correct that gun deaths for young black males outpace next 9 causes combined
","During the first presidential debate at Hofstra University, Hillary Clinton decried gun violence, especially as it impacts young African-Americans. ""The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African-American men, more than the next nine causes put together,"" she said. This is a claim Clinton has made before, and it’s accurate. We found the relevant data on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Using this search form, we collected data on the 10 most common causes of death for African-American men and boys between the ages of 15 and 24, for 2014:  There were 2,256 gun-related homicides in 2014, compared to 2,119 deaths in the next nine categories combined. This makes Clinton’s statement correct. If you add in the accidents and suicides related to guns, the gap between gun-related deaths and other types of deaths expands even further. There were 2,533 gun-related deaths in all 10 categories combined, compared to 2,002 deaths in the top 10 categories that had nothing to do with guns. We should note that this statement is dependent on the age range chosen. For instance, the statement is not correct for African-American boys between age 10 and 14. There were 38 gun-related homicides in that age and racial group in 2014, plus 10 gun suicides and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, for a total of 51. By contrast, the top 10 causes of death for that age and racial group included 271 deaths that had nothing to do with guns, such as diseases. That said, we think using the definition of ""young"" as 15-24 is a reasonable one. Our ruling Clinton said, ""The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African-American men, more than the next nine causes put together."" As long as you define ""young"" as being between the ages of 15 and 24, Clinton’s statement is accurate, according to CDC data.

Donald Trump wrong that 'you will learn more' from financial disclosure form than from tax returns
","Pressed on his refusal to follow decades of precedent and release his tax returns, Donald Trump at the first presidential debate repeated his assertion that the 92-page financial disclosure form he filed to the Federal Election Commission provides a better picture of his finances than the tax returns would. ""You will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the Federal Elections"" to see the financial disclosure form than by looking at his returns, Trump said. (Trump has cited an ongoing audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason he isn’t releasing the returns. Hillary Clinton has released her tax returns from 2000 to 2015.) Trump has a point that his financial disclosure form is extensive. Its 92 pages are crammed with small print detailing assets, income sources and positions held. (We were able to track his investments in the stock market, for instance.) By comparison, Mitt Romney -- the 2012 Republican nominee who was a businessman with a complex set of holdings -- filed a 47-page disclosure form, not counting amendments and updates. We have previously looked at the difference between the financial disclosure form, which is required of presidential candidates under federal law, and tax returns, which have been released since 1980 by tradition rather than legal requirement. We found little evidence to support Trump’s argument that the financial disclosure allows observers to ""learn more"" than they would from a tax form. ""It is true that Trump's businesses have received a lot of attention, but without the release of Trump's tax returns, we don't know a lot about his personal financial situation,"" Lawrence White, an economist at New York University’s Stern School of Business, told us earlier this month. The two most obvious pieces of the puzzle missing without Trump’s tax returns are the effective rate of tax he pays on his income, and details about his charitable giving. Depending on what figures appear on his tax forms, Trump could face political criticism. Paying a low tax rate could be politically embarrassing. And Trump has faced questions about his past charitable giving. (For details, see the ongoing coverage by reporter David Farenthold of the Washington Post.) Tax returns also can give a clearer picture of the candidate’s liquid assets. ""Trump can inflate his image of being rich on the financial disclosure forms, but you can get a better sense of how much he’s actually making from his tax returns,"" said former Romney aide Ryan Williams, who did not support Trump during the GOP primary and now says he’s officially undecided on the presidential race. Other nuggets can be gleaned from tax forms as well, such as what specific mix of taxes the candidate paid. ""Romney’s tax return showed us a ton of valuable information about Romney, including the fact that most of his substantial income was ‘carried interest,’ "" which is a type of tax-favored income available primarily to fund managers, said Allan Sloan, a business columnist for the Washington Post. Because of this, ""we saw that the majority of his income was taxed at low rates."" Trump wouldn’t necessarily qualify for the carried-interest tax, but as a someone in the real-estate business, he would have access to specialized tax breaks of his own, Sloan said. There is a ""provision in tax law that allows people who spend at least half their working time as real-estate or development professionals to get depreciation deductions not available to other investors,"" he said. ""That’s a huge loophole, and it’s gotten nothing like the attention that carried interest has gotten."" The fact that Trump has not run for office before or served in government makes the scrutiny of his business dealings especially important for those who care about transparency. Yet the fact that he runs a privately held company makes it hard for outsiders to get a handle on his personal finances as long as no public tax filing is available, experts said. ""Because Trump’s business dealings are varied and extensive, there is a lot to look at, but the quality of information is often poor, so reporters spend a lot of time looking at information insufficient to draw accurate conclusions,"" said Dennis Caplan, an associate professor of accounting at the University at Albany. Our ruling Trump said, ""You will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the Federal Elections"" to see the financial disclosure form than by looking at his returns. An observer would find valuable information about Trump’s personal financial holdings from his extensive (and legally required) financial-disclosure form. However, experts consider that a red herring. Unlike all presidential nominees since 1980, Trump has not released his tax returns, which experts say would offer valuable details on his effective tax rate, the types of taxes he paid, and how much he gave to charity, as well as a more detailed picture of his income-producing assets. Trump’s statement was, and is, inaccurate.

At New York debate, Donald Trump denies saying climate change is a Chinese hoax
","Amid a discussion about how to boost the U.S. economy, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said her opponent Donald Trump ""thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese."" ""I think it’s real,"" she said during a Sept. 26 debate in New York. ""I think science is real."" Trump interrupted. ""I did not — I did not — I do not say that. I do not say that,"" he said. Well, it turns out he did say that climate change is a ""hoax"" of Chinese origin — as we’ve found in previous fact-checks. On Nov. 6, 2012, Trump tweeted, ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.""  So Trump clearly did say, at least once, that climate change was a Chinese hoax. The subject of this 2012 tweet came up during a Jan. 18, 2016, episode of Fox & Friends. In that interview, Trump indicated the tweet was a joke. ""Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax,"" Trump said. ""A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. I'd be — received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn't care less. They have very — you know, their standards are nothing. But they — in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it's very hard on our business."" (Emphasis added.) Trump may call the mention of China’s role a joke, but he certainly has a lengthy record of using the word ""hoax"" to describe climate change. (For the record, in 2014 we rated a claim that climate change is a ""hoax"" Pants on Fire.) Here are a few examples: On Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., ""Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and … a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a money-making industry, okay? It's a hoax, a lot of it."" On Jan. 25, 2014, Trump tweeted, ""NBC News just called it the great freeze — coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?""  On Jan. 29, 2014, Trump tweeted: ""Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!""  That same day, he tweeted, ""Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense.""  Trump also called climate change a ""hoax"" on the Jan. 6, 2014, edition of Fox & Friends. In addition, he said on the Sept. 24, 2015, edition of CNN’s New Day, ""I don’t believe in climate change."" Our ruling Trump said,  ""I did not — I did not — I do not say that. I do not say that"" climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. He certainly did say it — in a tweet four years ago. While he has since described that remark as a ""joke,"" Trump has repeatedly called climate change a ""hoax"" in speeches, tweets and media appearances. And he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change ""is done for the benefit of China."" Because he hasn’t pushed this exact theory in recent years, as far as we’ve seen, there’s a tiny grain of truth to Trump’s claim. But it’s still inaccurate.

Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump has said he would negotiate down the national debt
","During the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump fought about his statements on the national debt. Clinton said, ""You even one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States."" As she spoke, Trump interjected, ""Wrong. Wrong."" We did not get a reply from the Trump campaign on the night of the debate. The Trump campaign also did not respond when we looked at his debt comments in May. Clinton is correct that Trump did talk about negotiating down the debt, but he backtracked on his views after economists panned his idea. Trump’s debt statements Clinton’s attack stems from comments Trump made about the national debt in two separate interviews in May. Trump’s initial remarks came in an interview with CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin and Becky Quick on May 5, 2016. Sorkin: ""Mr. Trump, you talk about debt. And you are to some degree the king of debt. I appreciate that point. You have also renegotiated debt agreements over the years. Do you believe that we, in terms of the United States, need to pay 100 cents on the dollar, or do you think that there's actually ways that we can renegotiate that debt?"" Trump: ""Yeah, I think -- look. I have borrowed, knowing that you can pay back with discounts. And I have done very well with debt. Now, of course, I was swashbuckling, and it did well for me and it was good for me and all that. And you know, debt was sort of always interesting to me. Now we're in a different situation with the country. But I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal. And if the economy was good, it was good. So, therefore, you can't lose. It's like, you know, you make a deal before you go into a poker game, and your odds are so much better."" ... Quick: ""I understand that you've done this in business deals, but are you suggesting we would negotiate with the U.S. credit in such a way?"" Trump: ""No, I think this. I think there are times for us to refinance. We refinance debt with longer term. Because you know, we owe so much money. … I could see long-term renegotiations, where we borrow long-term at very low rates."" ... Quick: ""But let's be clear. I mean, you're not talking about renegotiating sovereign bonds that the U.S. has already issued?"" Trump: ""No. I don't want to renegotiate the bonds. But I think you can do discounting, I think, you know, depending on where interest rates are, I think you can buy back. You can -- I'm not talking about with a renegotiation, but you can buy back at discounts, you can do things with discounts. … I would refinance debt. I think we should refinance longer-term debt."" The second comments came in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, on May 9, 2016. Trump: ""I’m only saying you can buy back. Look, this isn’t a real estate deal where you can go in and buy out a mortgage at a big discount because the market crashes, okay? This is the United States government. The bonds are absolutely sacred. … I’m saying if interest rates go up, you can buy debt at a discount on the market — just on the market. You just buy back debt on — at a discount."" Wall Street Journal: ""And so the U.S. government should spend its money to go buy back its bonds and --"" Trump: ""Well, if they can make good deals. If they can buy the debt back at good deals, you could buy it back in the market. And if rates go up, you’ll always — you’re always given that opportunity.  But no, I’m not talking about negotiating with — with people that own the debt or creditors or anything like that."" He tried to clarify his remarks in an interview on CNN May 9, and said that his comments had been misrepresented by the media. ""If interest rates go up and we can buy bonds back at a discount, if we are liquid enough as a country, we should do that. In other words, we can buy back debt at a discount,"" he said. ""People said I want to go and buy debt and default on debt, and these people are crazy."" Experts told PolitiFact in May that Trump’s statements were unclear and that he confused the concepts of ""discount,"" ""refinance,"" and ""renegotiate.""

""The statements are neither clear nor coherent,"" said Paolo Mauro, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a visiting professor at Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School when PolitiFact asked him about it in May. On the night of the first presidential debate, Dean Baker, an economist with the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, said that Trump’s comments ""didn’t make any sense."" ""The U.S. has the strongest possible credit rating because it has always paid its debt,"" he said. ""It would pay an enormous price if he tried to negotiate a write-down. We would pay higher interest rates for many decades in the future.More importantly, with the ratio of interest payments to (gross domestic product) at 50-year lows, it is hard to see why anyone would try to do this."" ""No one on the other side would pick up the phone if the secretary of the U.S. Treasury tried to make that call,"" said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, a firm that analyzes Federal Reserve operations, economic data and Treasury financing trends, told the New York Times. ""Why should they? They have a contract"" requiring payment in full. Our ruling Clinton said Trump one time suggested that he ""would try to negotiate down the national debt."" In two separate interviews in May, Trump suggested that he could do something to negotiate federal debt through ""discounting"" and that he would ""refinance debt"" and ""buy back debt on — at a discount."" He backtracked after criticism, saying his words had been misinterpreted. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/sep/27/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-donald-trump-has-said-he-woul/

Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump rooted for the housing crisis
","In the opening skirmish of the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton cast her rival as a man who put his own business interests ahead of the welfare of average Americans. ""Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis,"" Clinton said. ""He said back in 2006, ‘Gee, I hope it does collapse because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.’ What does the record show? We found many examples from 2006 to 2009 when Donald Trump spoke of the ""great opportunity"" that came with falling real estate prices. One of the earliest instances was in a Trump audiobook from 2006. The man interviewing Trump for the audiobook says, ""There's a lot of talk, which you've no doubt heard too, about a so-called real estate bubble. What's your take on that pessimism?"" ""Well first of all, I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy. You know, if you're in a good cash position — which I'm in a good cash position today — then people like me would go in and buy like crazy,"" he says in a portion of the audiobook posted by CNN. ""If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you can make a lot of money."" Now that was before the collapse that led to the Great Recession, and arguably, Trump was simply offering sound business guidance. Trump touted the same view a couple of times in 2007. But at that point, the country still was not looking at an economic catastrophe. The situation was quite different by early 2009. The investment house Lehman Brothers had filed for bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history. The Dow had suffered its worst weekly loss ever. Washington had bailed out General Motors and Chrysler. Foreclosures were rising weekly. Trump was on CNN Feb. 17, 2009, talking about the economy with host Wolf Blitzer and said the moment was a ""great opportunity."" Blitzer asked Trump why. ""If you get something really prime, really good, eventually it's going to be worth a lot more than you paid,"" Trump explained. ""I used to tell people two years ago, don't buy real estate and I used to preach it hard. And now I'm saying, I think that this is a good time. Whether you hit the exact market or not, I can't tell you. But I think this is a great time to buy. If you have cash, this is the great time to buy."" To be clear, Trump was speaking as an investor. He was not necessarily rooting for the housing crisis. But it was under way as he spoke. We reached out to the Trump campaign and did not receive any information to add to this picture. Our ruling Clinton said Trump was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. While Trump did not welcome the tragedy of foreclosures for millions of Americans, he did speak optimistically about the opportunities the overall situation created for an investor such as himself. Clinton’s statement leaves out that nuance, but in large measure, it matches Trump’s words.

Jack Berry says 'More moving vans coming in than going out"" of Richmond
","""Richmond is on a roll,"" said Jack Berry during a Sept. 15 mayoral debate sponsored by the Richmond Times-Dispatch. ""Our population is up. Investment is up, more moving vans coming in than going out,"" the candidate said. We were curious about the last of Berry’s proclamations - that there are ""more moving vans coming in than going out"" of the city. His campaign pointed us to a January report by the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia, which each year produces population tallies for the state and local officials for budgeting and planning. The center culls its estimates from a variety of sources, including from school enrollment figures, birth and death records, as well as driver’s license information and housing stock data. A chart in the report says that in July 2015, the most recent period for which figures are available, Richmond’s population was 217,938. That’s an increase of 13,724 from the April 2010 census, when the city had 204,214 people. The surrounding counties of Chesterfield, Henrico and Hanover all saw their populations rise during the same period but none as quickly as Richmond’s 6.8 percent growth.   Still, these figures include a rising population driven not just by people moving into Richmond but also births in the city. From April 2010 to mid-2015, there were 5,448 more births than deaths in the city; that accounted for about 40 percent of Richmond’s population growth during that time. To drill down on Berry’s claim - which specifically points to people moving into and out of the city - we need to look at tallies of Richmond’s ""net migration,"" which is the number of people who moved into the city minus those who left it. Between the April 2010 census and mid-2015, Richmond saw a net migration of 8,276 people into the city, Weldon Cooper Center’s figures show. Actually, starting in the mid-2000s the number of people moving into Richmond began to outpace the number who moved away, said Hamilton Lombard, a research specialist at Weldon Cooper. Before then, Lombard said there was a decades-long trend in which more people moved out of the city than into it. From July 2013 to July 2014, Richmond had a net gain of 1,255 people who moved in, Lombard wrote in an email. And from mid-2014 to mid-2015, net migration into the city rose to 3,437. Those are the latest years for which migration tallies are available. The center still is collecting net migration figures for Richmond for the 12-month period starting in July 2015. Early indications show a continued movement into the city, Lombard said. ""I think a simple explanation of why Richmond is growing is that developers have created many more housing units in the city in recent years, and more people have wanted to live in the city than in recent decades,"" Lombard told us. We also found figures from the U.S. Census Bureau that show a rise in the net migration into Richmond. The bureau, which computes net migration differently than Weldon Cooper, estimates a net migration of 11,073 people into the city from April 2010 to mid-2015. About one-third of those additional residents are immigrants who came from abroad, while the rest came from other parts of the U.S. The Internal Revenue Service also tracks how many people are going into and coming out of counties and cities across the U.S., based on tax returns filed with the IRS each year. Unlike the Weldon Cooper and Census Bureau estimates, Lombard said the IRS figures from 2014, the latest year available, still show more people moving out of Richmond than into it. But Lombard cautioned about reading too much into that finding. ""Typically, IRS migration data is very reliable, but it can be less accurate with young adults since they change addresses and jobs more often,"" Lombard wrote in an email. ""Given that Richmond has a large young adult population, and much of its recent growth has come from young adults, the IRS data may not be as reliable for tracking Richmond's migration."" Lombard noted some college students who move into the city to live and study here might not be picked up in the IRS data because those students are still reported on their parents’ tax returns as living at an address outside Richmond. Also, some young adults might not earn enough to file a return, or may skip filling out a return for a couple of years even though they’re supposed to file, Lombard said. That would make it tougher for the IRS to track their migration patterns, he said. Our ruling Berry said that in Richmond, there’s ""more moving vans coming in than going out."" Figures from the Census Bureau and the Weldon Cooper Center back Berry’s claim that Richmond has been seeing more people moving into the city than leaving. Figures from the IRS come to a different conclusion, but there’s a question over whether they are reliable when tracking Richmond’s moving patterns.

Donald Trump wrong to say Hillary Clinton wants to shut down natural gas, fracking
","The weekend before the first presidential debate, Donald Trump went to Roanoke, Va., to talk about energy. ""Here, in Virginia, we are going to end the war on American energy and on our miners. Hillary Clinton says she wants to put the miners out of work,"" Trump said. ""Clinton and (vice presidential candidate Tim) Kaine also want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas. What they've done is incredible."" Shale has become a dominant source of fossil fuels in the United States, thanks to a controversial process known as fracking. It wrings natural gas out of bedrock in a process that was once not considered profitable for extracting oil or natural gas. The process is efficient enough that the country's dependence on petroleum imports has declined precipitously. We wondered if the Clinton team wants to shut down fracking and the natural gas it produces. Trump's evidence Natural gas, composed mostly of methane, is extracted from shale rock by injecting it with pressurized water, sand and chemicals. Supporters note that burning it produces far less pollution than other types of fossil fuel. Critics say the process can cause earthquakes, water contamination and the unwanted release of methane, a gas renowned for trapping heat, which makes it a big player in climate change. When we contacted the Trump campaign, spokesman Jeff Wood sent us to a transcript of the March 6, 2016, Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich., where Clinton and her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, were asked about fracking. Sanders said he opposed it unconditionally. Clinton, who had come under fire by Sanders for her support of the technology, was less absolute. ""I don’t support it when any locality or any state is against it, number one,"" Clinton told the crowd. ""I don’t support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present. I don’t support it — number three — unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using."" ""So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place,"" she continued. ""And I think that’s the best approach, because right now, there are places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated. So first, we’ve got to regulate everything that is currently underway, and we have to have a system in place that prevents further fracking unless conditions like the ones that I just mentioned are met."" When we looked at this issue previously, we found evidence that Clinton had been supportive of fracking as secretary of state. She promoted it for Latin America, China, India and the European Union. In a 2009 speech, Clinton said: ""Now, I know that in some places it's controversial. But natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel available for power generation today, and a number of countries in the Americas may have shale gas resources."" She did, however, call for ""smart regulations"" on the practice. In an April debate against Sanders in Brooklyn, N.Y., Clinton was asked about her past statements as secretary of state. Clinton characterized natural gas as a ""bridge"" between dirty fuels, such as coal, and clean renewable energy, and said she was promoting it to other countries as a way to get European countries away from Russian sources. ""So we did say natural gas is a bridge. We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can,"" she said. Shut down fracking? Only a minority of states have banned fracking. Vermont was the first in 2012 and New York followed in 2014. Maryland has a moratorium on the practice through next year. Some municipalities have banned it as well. As for places with the unwanted release of methane — known as ""fugitive emissions"" — a 2015 study found that would apply to roughly one in 25 facilities. On the issue of water pollution, fracking critic Robert Howarth of Cornell University has estimated that 4 percent of production wells pollute water. And a 2015 EPA study said there were 151 cases of fracking spills in 11 states between 2006 and 2012.. When it comes to disclosing the chemicals used in the process, the impact of Clinton's rules would not be large. According to the American Chemical Society, 26 of the 28 states where fracking is done already have some disclosure rules, although those rules may not provide complete disclosure because they often drilling companies to protect what are regarded as trade secrets. It seems likely that if Clinton's ideas were put in place, drillers in the remaining two states could simply disclose the ingredients of their fracking solution the way drillers in other states have. When we asked the Clinton campaign about Trump's allegation, spokesman Josh Schwerin directed us to her campaign website and this statement: ""Switching to natural gas has avoided thousands of premature deaths and more than 100,000 asthma attacks by improving air quality, while creating good paying jobs and careers and helping reduce U.S. carbon pollution to its lowest level in 20 years,"" Clinton is quoted as saying. ""With strong safeguards in place, natural gas can play an important role in our transition to a clean energy economy . . . As President, I will ensure natural gas production is safe and responsible in those communities that choose to pursue it."" The Clinton campaign said she and Kaine agree on fracking and natural gas. Our ruling Trump said that Clinton and Kaine ""want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas."" Trump's campaign points to Clinton's statements that she wants to put restrictions on the fracking process used to extract natural gas from shale, and she wants to move the world away from petroleum sources as quickly as possible. But a review of Clinton's statements also make clear that she supports natural gas as a cleaner alternative to coal and oil. Her restrictions would not shut down fracking or natural gas production. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/17249e35-e2f6-4360-87a7-f75aadf95c06",/factchecks/2016/sep/26/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-say-hillary-clinton-wants-shut-/

Hassan claims Ayotte follows Koch brothers agenda 90 percent of the time
","Democrat Maggie Hassan has gone on the attack against Republican rival Kelly Ayotte in the race for U.S. Senate. Recently, Hassan accused Ayotte of siding with billionaires Charles and David Koch while representing New Hampshire in the Washington. ""During her first four years in Washington, Sen. Ayotte voted with the Koch brothers nearly 90 percent of the time,"" Hassan said at a recent Democratic unity breakfast. It’s a line straight from one her ads that aired earlier this month. Politifact decided to take a look. The Koch brothers have become well known-names in politics. The men own Koch Industries, the Wichita, Kan.-based parent company of several manufacturers and energy companies, like paper maker Georgia-Pacific and refinery Flint Hill Resources. But they have also waded in politics. The brothers’ financial backing helped to found Americans for Prosperity, an advocacy group that has spent millions backing Republican candidates in New Hampshire and other states. The brothers have never been elected members of Congress, nor have they ever cast a vote on the bills that came before Ayotte, a first-term U.S. senator elected in 2010. But the Koch Brothers know how to let their positions be known. Through a collection of organizations funded with their own money and contributions from donors, they wield massive political influence. Their funding and influence rivals the official Republican Party itself, and their aim is to ""fundamentally reshape American public life around a libertarian-infused brand of conservatism,"" according to Politico. Hassan’s camp pointed us to the flagship of the Koch brothers political network, Americans for Prosperity, and the organization’s scorecard, which ranks lawmakers votes ""for economic freedom"" each session. AFP favors limited government, low taxes and less regulation. It ranks senators votes according to those stated goals, and picks votes for its scorecard that relate to federal spending, energy, entitlements and taxes, among other issues. Ayotte received a 89 percent score from AFP in the 2011-2012 session after voting for bills ""to reduce spending back to 2008 fiscal year levels"" and to approve the Keystone XL pipeline and against a bill increasing taxes on oil and gas companies, according to the scorecard. Ayotte received a 90 percent score from AFP for the 2013-2014 session. Averaged together, those scores would come to 89.5 percent, or rounded up to 90 percent, which Hassan claims. Hassan’s camp left out Ayotte’s most recent score, from the 2015-2016 session, in which the Republican received a 70 percent rating from AFP. Even so, the scorecard isn’t a vote-by-vote grade. It’s not like AFP tallied the results of 100 votes and agreed with Ayotte 90 percent of the time. The organization scored her and all Senators on a sampling of votes in line with its agenda. Many other votes Ayotte took never registered on the scorecard and could have run afoul of the opinions of either Charles or David Koch. So is it fair to equate the scorecard rank to voting ""with the Koch brothers,"" as Hassan says? AFP’s Luke Hilgemann works with the group’s ""federal affairs team,"" led by AFP Vice President of Government Affairs Brent Gardner and his staff, to pick votes that are included in the scorecard. ""No other parties are involved in that process,"" said spokesman Levi Russell, director of public affairs. ""Charles and David Koch do not play a role in developing the AFP scorecard."" Our ruling Hassan said Ayotte voted with the Koch brothers ""90 percent of the time"" during her first four years in Washington. Ayotte earned a 90 percent rating during those years from an organizations the Koch brothers helped to found, Americans for Prosperity. But, the men don’t vote in the U.S. Senate and the organization said the brothers don’t play a direct role in choosing the votes.

Buffalo has more private sector jobs than ever before
","New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo two weeks ago toured a sprawling solar panel factory the state paid to have built in Buffalo and said, ""I am just blown away by this facility."" Cuomo returned to Buffalo on Friday, a day after U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara announced bombshell corruption allegations that included bid rigging to build the plant at RiverBend for SolarCity. The criminal charges won’t stop Buffalo’s resurgence, Cuomo said in his remarks at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo. He cited completion of the $750 million facility as a milestone in the state’s Buffalo Billion economic development initiative, which he said ""is working because the private sector believes in Buffalo again."" Cuomo defended the state’s investments in Buffalo with a claim about the number of private jobs in the Buffalo region. ""Most private sector jobs in the history of Buffalo exist in Buffalo today,"" Cuomo said. Cuomo has devoted his time and the state’s resources on upstate revitalization. Is he right? Does Buffalo have more private sector jobs than ever before? Private sector jobs Neither the state nor the U.S. Department of Labor tracks the number of jobs for the city of Buffalo alone. Instead, they break the state up into regions, including the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area. The state and national labor departments both show the same numbers for private sector jobs. But information is available only back to 1990. The way job data is compiled changed in 1990, so the figures from the past 25 years can't be accurately compared with the numbers before 1990. The federal and state labor departments reported 479,500 private sector jobs in August in the Buffalo Niagara region. There were 439,000 jobs in 1990. The closest the Buffalo area came to the August jobs number before Cuomo took office was in November 2000, when the state reported 474,700 private sector jobs. Private sector jobs in June and July of this year exceeded that number, but still fell below the August number. Our ruling During Cuomo’s remarks in Buffalo, he said the ""most private sector jobs in the history of Buffalo exist in Buffalo today."" Data from the federal and state labor departments back up his claim.

American Crossroads ad says 85 percent of recent college grads are moving in with Mom and Dad
","
In a provocative campaign ad, American Crossroads, a Republican-aligned group, criticized President Barack Obama for being a ""celebrity"" who yukked it up with Jimmy Fallon, danced a softshoe with Ellen DeGeneres and dissed Kanye West as a ""jackass"" -- while the economy crumbled.

We zeroed in on one claim in the ad -- that ""after four years of a celebrity president … 85% (of recent college grads are) moving back in with their parents.""

Where the 85 percent figure comes from

The ad attributes the claim to a Time magazine story dated May 10, 2011. We found the article in question, which was headlined, ""Survey: 85% of New College Grads Move Back in with Mom and Dad.""

The story begins, ""The kids are coming home to roost. Surprise, surprise: Thanks to a high unemployment rate for new grads, many of those with diplomas fresh off the press are making a return to Mom and Dad’s place. In fact, according to a poll conducted by consulting firm Twentysomething Inc., some 85% of graduates will soon remember what Mom’s cooking tastes like.""

Since the Time story didn’t give any details on the study or give any indication that a reporter had called the firm -- the same was true for the two other media reports that cited the statistic, the New York Post and CNNMoney.com -- we tried to contact Twentysomething Inc. for additional details on the methodology and date of the survey.

Twentysomething's website was not much help. There was no news release about the study, and the phone number listed had been disconnected. It appears the site hasn't been updated since 2009.

Ultimately, we received a call back from David A. Morrison, the firm’s managing director and founding partner. Morrison said he had closed down his Philadelphia-based firm after about two decades of operation and left the area. He told us the poll had been done for a client ""many years ago"" but would not release any details about the methodology, citing a binding non-disclosure agreement with the client, whom he would not name.

Morrison speculated that his client had leaked the numbers to the media. ""These numbers tend to get recycled,"" Morrison said.

He is right about it being recycled. The statistic has been repeated many times on websites and blogs -- twice in the Huffington Post, for instance, and once in the personal finance blog PT Money. It even was picked up by bloggers both liberal (Democratic Underground) and conservative (Free Republic), each with their own political spin. We did not hear back from the author of the Time magazine article.

Morrison told us that given the fact the survey was done ""many years ago,"" it was not accurate to use statistic the way the ad did.

What’s the actual number?

As it happens, there are credible statistics about grads returning home, from a report released March 15, 2012 by the Pew Research Center, titled ""The Boomerang Generation: Feeling OK about Living with Mom and Dad.""

The report included a survey of 2,048 adults nationwide conducted Dec. 6 to Dec. 19, 2011. Unlike Twentysomething, Pew offered extensive documentation about how it had conducted the poll and what the results were.

The report examines the boomerang phenomenon for different demographic groups, but none come close to 85 percent:

• Among adults ages 18 to 29, 42 percent of those who have graduated college live with their parents.

• Among adults ages 25 to 29 with or without a college degree, 41 percent either live with or moved back in with their parents.

• Among adults ages 18 to 34, 24 percent moved back in with their parents in recent years after living on their own, due to economic conditions.

• Among parents of adult children, 29 percent report that a child of theirs has moved back in with them in the past few years because of the economy.

The Pew report does show modest support for a trend of grads moving back home. It found that in 2010, almost 22 percent of adults ages 25 to 34 lived in a ""multigenerational household,"" up from about 16 percent in 2000; of these, the vast majority were living with their parents. (""Multi-generational households"" are defined to include parents living with children 25 and older, or households with three or more generations.)

Finally, when we take up a claim in which the speaker seeks to assign credit or blame to a politician for something that happens on their watch, we also consider whether credit or blame is warranted. And as we have ruled in the past, no president can unilaterally move the economy, much less determine whether grads have to move home with Mom and Dad.

""There was a worldwide credit bubble that led to a worldwide financial collapse that led to a global Great Recession,"" said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation told us last month. ""If you accept that observation, it becomes hard to blame anyone in the U.S. overly for the results.""
   
Foster added, ""The simple political narrative is to blame the other side. Fair enough to a point. The party in power always gets too much blame and too much credit, depending on circumstances.""

So it's a stretch to blame Obama if more grads are returning home.

Our ruling

The ad cites a questionable survey and suggests the data is new when the author says the survey was ""many years ago.""

Also, the 85 percent figure is at least twice the highest rate found by Pew, a well-respected research group. And the ad blames Obama for a phenomenon that economists say is beyond the impact of a president. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2012/may/01/american-crossroads/american-crossroads-ad-says-85-percent-recent-coll/

Lee Leffingwell says Austin has lowest property tax rate of Texas’ 5 biggest cities
","
Two days before city staffers discussed raising Austin’s property tax levy, Mayor Lee Leffingwell touted the city’s rate in a televised debate.

Facing off against mayoral opponents Brigid Shea and Clay Dafoe in an April 16, 2012, forum on KXAN-TV, Channel 36, Leffingwell said, ""The City of Austin has the lowest property tax rate by far of the five major cities in Texas, including Fort Worth, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio.""

Does that add up?

By email, Leffingwell campaign consultant Mark Littlefield and city spokesman Reyne Telles told us that Leffingwell used data from a chart prepared by city staff for its annual five-year financial forecast. Littlefield sent us that chart plus a second one showing estimated tax bills in each city.

Ed Van Eenoo, Austin’s city budget officer, told us by email that his office created the charts with 2011 tax rates, home values and sales price information from county appraisal districts and the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University.

We checked the numbers with the districts and center, and found Austin’s property tax rate was the lowest, considerably, of Texas’ five biggest cities, as Leffingwell said. The full list: Fort Worth, 85.5 cents per $100 of appraised value; Dallas, 79.7 cents; Houston, 63.875 cents; San Antonio, 56.5569 cents, Austin, 48.11 cents.

But tax rates are only part of the equation when it comes to figuring out how hard a homeowner’s pocketbook gets hit.

Here, in fact, is the equation, from Austin’s budget office: Take your house’s dollar value; subtract any homestead or other exemptions; divide by 100; then multiply by the tax rate -- with the tax rate expressed in dollars; for example, 0.4811 rather than ""48.11 cents.""

We calculated how much typical homeowners had to pay in 2011 using two different measures: average appraised values from each county tax appraisal districts, and median sales price from the center, which gets data from real estate professionals across the state. 
Although exemptions affect many tax bills, we excluded them here because they vary with each homeowner and each city, county and taxing jurisdiction. 
In 2011, Austin had both the highest median sale price and the highest average appraised value among the five cities. But because of the city’s low tax rate, Austin’s tax bill (excluding exemptions) on an average-value home was second-highest, and its tax bill on a median sales-price home came in fourth.

Calculated using 2011 median sales price and 2011 city tax rate, Dallas had the highest bill -- $1,262 on a $158,400 house -- followed by Houston’s $982 on a $153,700 house, Fort Worth’s $946 bill on a $110,600 house, Austin’s $918 on a $190,900 house and San Antonio’s $856 on a $151,300 house.

Using the same tax rates and 2011’s average appraised values, Dallas was first again, with a $1,441 bill on a $180,847 house, followed by Austin’s $1,224 bill on a $254,328 house, Houston’s $1,057 on a $165,535 house, Fort Worth’s $968 on a $113,247 house and San Antonio’s $725 on a $128,151 house. 
  
Because averages can be skewed by a few very high or low values, taking the median value offers a way to dampen the effect of those extremes. Medians represent a ""middle"" value -- median sales price would be the dollar amount at which half a city's homes sold for more and half sold for less.

The city's tax bill chart used median sales prices, except for Austin, where the median appraised home value was available, and factored in homestead exemptions. Reckoned that way, Austin’s tax bill again came out second-highest.

Of course, cities are only one of the entities taking a chomp out of your property taxes. Depending on where your house is, county government, school districts, community colleges and possibly many others get a bite.

The Austin owner of a $190,900 home in 2011, for example, paid $2,371 to the Austin school district; $927 to Travis County; $181 to Austin Community College; and $151 to Central Health (Travis County’s healthcare district) on top of the $918 city tax bill.

Also, Austinites recently learned that 2013 might bring an increase in the city’s rate. The Austin American-Statesman reported April 18 that the owner of a median-value home would pay $33 more under a tax rate of 49.95 cents per $100 of property -- the rate city staffers said Austin would need to cover its costs next year.

Leffingwell responded to the news with a statement that he would look for ways to cut spending rather than raise the property tax rate.

That 49.95-cent rate for 2012 is still lower than the other cities’ 2011 rates, but it’s too early to know what all the 2012 rates -- and home values -- will be.

Our ruling

Leffingwell’s right on the rates. Austin had the lowest 2011 city property tax rate among Texas’ five biggest cities.

Yet rates alone are not the only, or even best, indicator of how much residents have been socked by property taxes. Comparing each city’s average-value home in 2011, for instance, Austin would have extracted the second-highest tax payment.

Without this context, Leffingwell’s rate comparison misrepresents this pocketbook issue. His claim rates Half True.",/factchecks/2012/may/01/lee-leffingwell/lee-leffingwell-says-austin-has-lowest-property-ta/

Nobody is leaving Memphis, says city councilman Joe Brown
","
When Memphis Mayor A C Wharton kicked off the budget season by presenting his administration’s plan for financing city government for 2012-13, budget chairman Jim Strickland talked about the possibility that a proposed one-time tax for schools might make more people vote ""with their tail lights"" by leaving the city.

That brought a challenge from Memphis City Councilman Joe Brown, who is a reliable advocate of increasing city government taxes and spending.  ""Nobody is leaving Memphis,"" Brown said. ""That's a myth.""

Even the mayor’s budget document cites the negative migration trend, noting that tax revenues ""have been negatively impacted by years of population decline and decimated by the recent recession."" So we felt obligated to put Councilman Brown’s claim to the Truth-O-Meter

Brown did not respond to numerous messages or emails asking for evidence to support his claim. It’s worth noting here that this Joe Brown, the city councilman, is not the same Joe Brown from Memphis famous for being a TV judge.

No, this Joe Brown is the councilman who attracted international attention for Memphis in 2004 when he barred seven Iraqi community and civic leaders from City Hall, citing fears of terrorism. ""We don’t want another Oklahoma City,"" he said at the time, adding confusion about domestic terrorism with his confusion about the origins of the 9/11 attacks.

When we contacted Strickland about Brown’s claim, he went straight to the numbers, saying that his analysis shows the city has been bleeding residents at a yearly rate of about a half-percent of the population – roughly 3,000 more people leave the city than move to it. He says he’s even looked at Memphis Light, Gas & Water data that show yearly declines in customers.

""All the evidence points to people voting with their tail lights,"" Strickland said. ""They are leaving. Most of the people leaving are middle class and Memphis is losing its middle class.""

U.S. Census Bureau numbers from 2000 and 2010 back up Strickland. We have tracked this closely at The Commercial Appeal over the years, and Tom Charlier reported on it extensively in a piece last March. Between the 2000 and 2010 decennial censuses, Memphis’s population fell from 650,100 to 646,889 -- but those raw numbers mask a larger story of population shifts out of the city.

One key variable involves Memphis’s 2002 annexation of an 11.5-square-mile area of Cordova -- which contained 35,000 residents. If population in all other parts of Memphis had remained stable, at the very least the city should have shown an increase of 35,000 from the 2000 Census to the 2010 Census.

There’s also the matter of births far out-numbering deaths, which all things being equal would lead to population gain. While these numbers are not readily available for specific cities in Tennessee, the state does track them by county. University of Memphis researcher Charlie Santo pointed us to data that shows that in Shelby County, of which Memphis comprises 69.7 percent of the population, there were 145,120 births between 2001 and 2010 and 76,463 deaths.

Thus, the county should have added 68,657 people based on more births than deaths, and if we apportion 69.7 percent of that to Memphis, that means the city could have expected to grow by 47,854 people.

Add that 47,854 to the 35,000 Cordova residents forced into the city limits by annexation, and you see that, had there been an absolute zero rate of migration into or out of the city, Memphis’s population should have increased over the decade by 82,854.

And, yet, the city showed a population decline of 3,211 people over that period. So more than 85,000 people that would have been expected to be present in census calculations were in fact nowhere to be found inside of Memphis.

We also know that the six incorporated suburban cities and towns inside Shelby County grew by 33 percent between 2000 and 2010, adding a total of 41,918 residents. Suburban towns and cities in bordering counties also showed great growth. And in Mississippi’s DeSoto County, which borders Memphis and Shelby County to the south, population grew by 37 percent, with the addition of 43,507 residents.

We cannot say exactly how many of those new suburban residents came from Memphis, but the Census Bureau numbers from its 2010 American Community Survey reveal substantial migration from Memphis to the suburbs.

The 2010 ACS, a scientifically rigorous U.S. Census sampling, shows a yearly migration out of Memphis of 32,580 people -- 11,425 moved from Memphis to the remainder of Shelby County, 5,767 moved to a different county in Tennessee and 15,388 moved to different state.

We did not get numbers for in-migration, because Brown’s comment focused specifically on whether people are leaving Memphis. But the numbers from the decennial census make it clear more people are moving out of Memphis every year than are moving in.

As Charlier wrote, this is a staggering trend because it marks only the second decline in a decennial census since the yellow fever epidemic of the 1870s.

Smart City Memphis blogger Tom Jones, a former longtime Shelby County government administrator, put it into greater historical context: ""Within the 1970 city limits of Memphis, there are more than 30% fewer people; if Memphis were not able to masquerade its population losses through annexations, the city might well have lost more people than any city in the Sun Belt.""

Our ruling

Brown defends his desire to raise taxes and increase spending in Memphis by saying it's ""a myth"" that residents are leaving Memphis. But he need only look at the mayor's budget document, which says the city has suffered ""years of population decline."" And numbers from the Census Bureau show a more detailed story of the steady out-migration. It has been masked by annexations and yearly births outnumbering deaths, but it's a very real trend.

John Boehner tweets that Dems voted to double student loan interest rates
","
The U.S. House of Representatives voted April 27, 2012, on a measure to stop interest rates on student loans from doubling this summer. 
Speaker John Boehner announced the surprise vote at a hastily called news conference on Wednesday, hours after President Obama named the Ohio Republican as a chief obstacle to the Democrats’ plan to keep the loan benefit from expiring.

""This week the president is campaigning and trying to invent a fight where there is none and never has been on this issue of student loans,"" Boehner said. ""We can, and will, fix the problem — without a bunch of campaign-style theatrics.""

But the speaker himself had weighed in earlier on the issue, with a posting on Twitter that caught the attention of PolitiFact Ohio.

""Student loan rates set to double because a Democratic-controlled Congress voted to double them,"" he tweeted on @speakerboehner, his official account, in Twitter's 140-character shorthand.

It ended with a link to the speaker's blog, on his website, which added this: ""In 2007, the Democratic majority in Congress enacted legislation to double interest rates on new federal student loans from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent in 2012.""

Voting to double student loan rates would hit a lot of wallets. We asked Boehner's office how he backed up the charge. They referred us to an Associated Press story linked on his blog.

""While Obama blames Republicans for voting against new ways to make college more affordable for middle-class families,"" the story said, ""it was House Democrats who cut interest rates on the school loans in 2007 and included an expiration provision that placed the looming increase in the middle of an election year.""

That does not describe a vote to double rates, and it did not clarify the issue to our satisfaction. We looked further.

The 2007 vote in question was on the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, H.R. 2669. It gradually reduced the interest rate on federally subsidized loans to undergraduate student borrowers from 6.8 percent in July 2006 to 3.4 percent in July 2011.

Advanced by a newly Democratic-majority Congress, the law had bipartisan support. Democrats were joined by 77 House Republicans and 35 Senate Republicans. The bill was signed by President George W. Bush.

The law was temporary. It expires this July. If no action is taken, the interest rate will return to 6.8 percent.

The increase would affect more than 7 million borrowers, and add $1,000 a year to the repayment cost of the average loan, according to Education Secretary Arne Duncan.

Obama's budget proposal for fiscal 2013 included money to extend the rate cut, but only for one year.

The Republican budget -- advanced by Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, supported by GOP leadership and passed by the House -- returns the interest rate to 6.8 percent.

Extending the program for one year would cost $6 billion.

Democrats have offered proposals to pay for extending the lower interest rate. One would end a payroll tax exemption given some business owners. Another would end tax subsidies for oil and gas companies.

Neither of those proposals was considered likely to draw any Republican support.

The GOP measure advanced by Boehner had its own poison pill that made it unlikely to get past, or to, Obama's desk: Boehner said the bill would pay the cost of the loan program with money for preventive health care programs from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Boehner labeled the money a ""slush fund,"" a characterization Republicans have long used for the program. PolitiFact rated the term as a Pants on Fire falsehood when Boehner applied it to the health care act a year ago.

But the statement we're reviewing now is this: ""Student loan rates [are] set to double because a Democratic-controlled Congress voted to double them.""

It is accurate in saying that Democrats were in the majority when Congress passed the College Cost Reduction and Access Act in 2007. It is accurate in saying that the loan rate reductions in the measure are scheduled to expire in July, and that the result would double the current rate.

But to describe that initial vote five years ago as one in which the Democratic majority ""voted to double"" rates this year is misleading at best.

Deal: HOPE aid keeps Georgia's brightest close to home
","
Even as elected officials cut the beloved HOPE scholarship, they’re going out of their way to remind voters they think it’s good for Georgia and they want it to survive.

The nearly 20-year-old program uses Georgia Lottery money to pay in-state college tuition for the state’s highest-performing students.

Gov. Nathan Deal told attendees at a recent Atlanta Press Club luncheon that HOPE is keeping Georgia’s best and brightest close to home.

""I am told ... and I think my statistic is correct on this, that prior to HOPE, 70 percent of the high school students who made 1400 or above on their SAT left the state of Georgia,"" he said April 17.

""Now the figure is reversed,"" Deal said. ""Seventy percent of those stay in the state of Georgia. And that makes a huge difference on a number of fronts.""  

Sounds like a huge difference to us, but is this statistic true?

First, some context. The scholarship has been cut in recent years because spending was growing faster than the state could afford.

It used to provide full rides to state schools for those who met its requirements. HOPE now pays full tuition for only about 10 percent of recipients.

The rest receive scholarships that cover 90 percent of tuition at 2010-11 academic year rates. That percentage will likely shrink over time.

Do students who make 1400 or above on their SAT stay in Georgia at more than twice the rate they did before HOPE?

We hunted for the source of Deal’s information and came up short. We found no studies, published or otherwise, that directly support Deal’s statement.

What we did find is that a string of credible officials have used this factoid or one like it. Their statements appear in multiple news outlets, including The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

This doesn’t mean Deal’s claim is false. Data show it has a ring of truth.

Deal’s office responded to our inquiry with a peer-reviewed study published in 2006 in the Journal of Labor Economics about the effects of HOPE on college enrollment.

The study did not conclude that the percentage of students who score 1400 or better has grown. Instead, a footnote refers readers to a statement in an October 2000 Athens Banner-Herald article, which in turn quoted then-Gov. Roy Barnes.

""Since the HOPE program started seven years ago, [Barnes] said, the state's rate of retaining students with SAT scores between 1500 and 1600 has climbed from 23 percent to 76 percent,"" according to the story.

Barnes told PolitiFact Georgia that he got the number from former University System of Georgia Chancellor Stephen Portch, who had the numbers calculated at the governor’s request.

Portch made a similar claim in 2011 to an AJC reporter, but he used a 1400 combined reading and math score as his threshold.

Atlanta Magazine and an Augusta television station have also used the number in recent years.

Data we found don’t refute these claims. SAT scores of freshmen in Georgia’s state schools appear to be increasing, as is the number of students staying in-state.

In fact, the Journal of Labor Economics study found that HOPE reduced the number of students leaving Georgia for college by an average of 560 per year.

Furthermore, the average SAT score of freshmen in Georgia public colleges and universities rose nearly 40 points after HOPE, the study said. Average scores in Georgia and the U.S. rose only slightly during that time.

Other information suggests Deal was heading in the right direction. But it also raises the possibility that he overstated the percentage of high-scoring college students who stayed.

A 2003 presentation by the University System of Georgia stated that in 1992, 36 percent of Georgia’s college-bound seniors who scored 1000 or above enrolled in the system’s schools. Ten years later, that number was 57 percent.

The change among higher-scoring students was not so dramatic.

For students who scored between 1400 and 1490, the figure climbed 23 percentage points, from 21 percent to 44 percent. The percentage rose to 30 percent for those who scored 1500 and above, an increase of only 8 points.

This information has shortcomings. It’s old, and we could not find further details on how researchers came to these conclusions.

Furthermore, students can also use HOPE money to attend private schools in Georgia. The data do not show what happened to them.

More recent data also suggest Deal is on the right track. According to data provided by the governor’s office, the mean SAT score of freshmen entering UGA jumped from 1,086 to 1,226 between 1993 and 2011.

This bodes well for Deal’s statement, but it does not confirm it directly.

The governor used very specific numbers in his HOPE claim, but his office could not back them up. There’s also a possibility the data Deal and others have used are far out of date. The newspaper article cited in the study his office sent us is more than a decade old.

Deal’s statement contains a kernel of truth. Recent information backs up the larger claim that more of Georgia’s high-achieving students are staying in-state to attend college.

But Deal set a high bar when he used such specific figures.

The governor earns a Mostly False.

Obama ad says Mitt Romney's view on killing bin Laden was 'it's not worth moving heaven and earth'
","
A Web ad from President Barack Obama’s campaign about the death of Osama bin Laden asks, ""Which path would Mitt Romney have taken?"" 
The ad features former President Bill Clinton saying Obama ""took the harder, and more honorable path,"" when he approved the May 2, 2011, strike that killed the terrorist mastermind.

By contrast, it portrays Romney as less committed to the effort to kill the al-Qaida leader. It says Romney once criticized Obama for ""vowing to strike al-Qaida targets inside Pakistan if necessary.""

Then it shows a clip of CNN’s Wolf Blitzer quoting Romney as saying in April 2007, ""It's not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person."" 
By using that quote, the ad indicates that Romney would not have pursued the al-Qaida leader. Indeed, that's how headlines described the April 27, 2012, ad. 
A conservative blogger pounced on the ad's implication, saying it took Romney’s ""heaven and earth"" quote out of context. (That charge was also levied back in 2007 about the Associated Press story that quoted Romney in the first place.) Fox News followed, saying ""Obama campaign's bin Laden ad omits Romney clarification on key quote.""

We wondered: Did the ad accurately characterize Romney’s ""heaven and earth"" quote? Was he really lukewarm — or even opposed — to the effort to get bin Laden? 
The AP interview

There’s no dispute that Romney said about bin Laden, ""It's not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person.""

But was he saying he wouldn’t pursue the terrorist?

The quote comes from an Associated Press story on April 26, 2007, about a Romney interview with reporter Liz Sidoti that covered a range of topics. Here’s the related passage: 
In the interview, Romney also: 
Said the country would be safer by only ""a small percentage"" and would see ""a very insignificant increase in safety"" if al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden was caught because another terrorist would rise to power. ""It's not worth moving heaven and earth spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person,"" Romney said. Instead, he said he supports a broader strategy to defeat the Islamic jihad movement. 
At the time, Democrats such as Obama were criticizing President George W. Bush for failing to find bin Laden. Republicans, in turn, were critical of Obama's focus on capturing or killing the terrorist leader. 
A post from the conservative site Townhall.com in 2007 says it got a transcript from Romney’s campaign at the time that shows he followed the ""heaven and earth"" line with the sentence: ""It is worth fashioning and executing an effective strategy to defeat global, violent Jihad and I have a plan for doing that.""

Later, he explains, ""Global jihad … involves millions of people and is going to require a far more comprehensive strategy than a targeted approach for bin Laden or a few of his associates.""

Sidoti, now AP’s political editor, couldn’t confirm the accuracy of the transcript for us, and Romney’s campaign didn’t respond to our inquiry. Lucky for us, Romney himself had a chance to clarify his words just days after he spoke them, in a May 4, 2007, Republican presidential debate.

The moderator of the MSNBC debate, which featured nine Republicans, brought up Romney’s ""heaven and earth"" quote, which rival Arizona Sen. John McCain had called ""naive."" 
MODERATOR: ""Gov. Romney, respond to the mentioned reference to you ... by Sen. McCain."" 
ROMNEY: ""Thank you. Of course we get Osama bin Laden and track him wherever he has to go, and make sure he pays for the outrage he exacted upon America."" 
MODERATOR: ""Can we move heaven and earth to do it?"" 
ROMNEY: ""We'll move everything to get him. But I don't want to buy into the Democratic pitch that this is all about one person — Osama bin Laden — because after we get him, there's going to be another and another. This is about Shia and Sunni. This is about Hezbollah and Hamas and al-Qaida and the Muslim Brotherhood. This is a worldwide jihadist effort to try and cause the collapse of all moderate Islamic governments and replace them with a caliphate. 
""They ultimately want to bring down the United States of America. 
""This is a global effort we're going to have to lead to overcome this jihadist effort. It's more than Osama bin Laden. 
""But he is going to pay, and he will die."" 
That suggests Romney was criticizing Democrats for focusing too much on the al-Qaida leader rather than the full organization and would have aggressively pursued bin Laden in the context of a larger antiterror strategy.

Still, Romney suggested just a few months later that he wouldn’t do what Obama ultimately did — call for a secret, unilateral Navy SEALs strike inside Pakistan. In 2007, Obama had said that if he were elected president, he would be willing to launch strikes against al-Qaida targets in Pakistan with or without Pakistan’s approval.

An Aug. 4, 2007, headline from Reuters — an article cited by Obama’s ad — says, ""Romney attacks Obama over Pakistan warning.""

Romney called Obama's comments ‘ill-timed’ and ‘ill-considered,’"" Reuters reported, along with other news services.

""There is a war being waged by terrorists of different types and nature across the world,"" Romney said, according to Reuters. ""We want, as a civilized world, to participate with other nations in this civilized effort to help those nations reject the extreme with them."" 
Romney ""said U.S. troops ‘shouldn't be sent all over the world.'""

Other Republicans (and Democrat Hillary Clinton) had the same complaint, with some going so far as to say Obama ""wants to bomb Pakistan,"" a statement we rated Pants on Fire.

The Obama campaign, on the other hand, had issued a memo that the United States had deferred to the Pakistani president’s judgment long enough, and that, ""Barack Obama wants to turn the page,"" Reuters reported.

Our ruling

An Obama campaign ad suggested Mitt Romney wouldn’t have agressively pursued Osama bin Laden by citing Romney's statement that, ""It's not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person.""

The Obama campaign is right that Romney used those words, but by cherry-picking them, it glosses over comments describing his broader approach. Romney said he wanted to pursue all of al-Qaida, not just its leaders. 
The reporter quoting him in April 2007 said he instead ""endorsed a broader strategy to defeat the Islamic jihad movement."" And he said just over a week later that he would ""get Osama bin Laden and track him wherever he has to go, and make sure he pays for the outrage he exacted upon America … he is going to pay, and he will die.""

Still, Romney was clear later that summer that he would prefer to participate with allies rather than take unilateral action to kill terrorists as Obama supported — and later did. The ad takes Romney’s words out of context, but gets part of the story right. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2012/apr/30/barack-obama/obama-ad-says-mitt-romneys-view-killing-bin-laden/

Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn says Gov. Scott Walker’s budget increases property taxes by $500 billion
","

From his earliest days in office, Republican Gov. Scott Walker has used Wisconsin’s southerly neighbor as a punching bag, hitting Illinois for trying to tax its way out of a big deficit.

Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn volleyed back when Walker crossed the border for an April 17, 2012 speech in Springfield to tout his record -- and troll for businesses looking to relocate -- at the Illinois Chamber of Commerce.

In a campaign fundraising email, Quinn bashed Wisconsin’s last-in-the nation record on job creation in 2011 and tried to poke holes in Walker’s record on taxes.

""You might have heard that the Illinois Chamber of Commerce hosted Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker as guest speaker today,"" the email said. ""One would wonder what a governor with a terrible economic record could have to say about jobs and economic growth. While Governor Walker might be fond of anti-worker and tea party rhetoric, the facts aren't on his side.""

Quinn’s hit list ended with this:

""Governor Walker's budget increases state spending by over $1 billion, which is primarily paid for by tax increases on seniors, families with children, and home owners. His budget calls for raising property taxes by nearly … $500 billion.""

In an earlier item we confirmed that Walker signed a two-year budget that raised spending by more than $1 billion, a 1.8% increase over the biennium. Most of the increase was in Medicaid programs, which are entitlements.

But did the budget lead to $500 billion in property tax increases? Hasn’t Walker been touting a property tax freeze?

Right out of the gate we found a problem with Quinn’s number.

The day after Quinn’s email, we asked his campaign about the figure. Five days later we were told it was a typo that was being corrected. They meant $500 million, not billion.

By that time, the higher figure has been reprinted in a Rockford newspaper editorial and on political blogs in both states.

Scott Belsky, executive director of Quinn’s campaign organization, subsequently told us the exact figure they are referring to is $483.8 million. The figure, he said, is from Walker’s cut in two tax credits for low-income homeowners and working families, plus ""increasing taxes on local levels of government.""

Sure enough, that number or something close to it was cited by various Democrats after Walker signed the budget in June 2011. They did their math using estimates published in July 2011 by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state’s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper.

That’s a great source, but the Fiscal Bureau report didn’t actually use the $483.8 million number in estimating the total property tax increase for two years.

Fiscal Bureau official Rick Olin said their estimate is better stated as $338 million -- that comes from a comparison of estimated 2012 tax levies with the pre-Walker base year of 2010.

Going for the worst-sounding math (just as Republicans have done in the past), Democrats took the estimates for each of the two Walker years and compared them to the 2010 base.

""Nobody thinks about it that way,"" said Olin, a fiscal analyst on property taxes.

What about the two tax credits Quinn’s campaign cites?

One was for income taxes, so that’s irrelevant to his claim on property taxes. The other Walker change, on the Homestead credit, did in effect raise property taxes by $13.6 million, state fiscal estimates show.

So take the $338 million and the $13.6 million and you’re at more than a $350 million increase predicted under Walker’s budget.

But there’s a much bigger problem for Quinn.

The numbers were Fiscal Bureau estimates from about nine months ago.

On April 16, 2012, the day before Quinn’s campaign rolled out the unwelcome mat for Walker, the Wisconsin governor announced hard data on what local governments actually raised property taxes.

The net levy increase was $21 million (0.2 percent) in year one -- far, far lower than the Fiscal Bureau projection.

Indeed, the owner of a median-valued home actually saw a slight decrease on the property tax bill.

A big reason was the tightened revenue caps Walker and GOP legislators slapped on localities -- creating a virtual tax freeze, with an exception increases tied to new construction. Fewer communities than expected used even the little wiggle room Walker gave them.

So, while Quinn’s email blamed Walker for property tax decisions made by local officials, the record shows Walker actually sought aggressive controls on local increases.

Our rating

Quinn said his Wisconsin counterpart had increased property taxes nearly $500 billion. That was explained as an old-fashioned typo. But even then, the $500 million is way off.

When Walker signed the budget in June 2011, property taxes were estimated to go up $350 million under the most common accounting. That estimate held until the April 16, 2012 report -- and it seems likely Quinn’s email was prepared before Walker’s announcement changed the game.

But he didn’t correct the million/billion typo in a timely way, and is still using the equally wrong $500 million claim. We think that’s ridiculous.

And that makes this a Pants on Fire!

Rep. Steve Rothman claims Rep. Bill Pascrell “voted to eliminate all estate taxes for billionaires”
","
When it comes to protecting the middle class, U.S. Rep. Steve Rothman makes it sound like U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell isn’t the fighter he claims to be.

As the two Democrats prepare to face off in the June 5 primary to represent a newly drawn congressional district in northern New Jersey, Rothman criticized Pascrell in a recent YouTube video for voting ""to eliminate all estate taxes for billionaires.""

""The people of the district really are looking for a progressive Democrat, and they’re looking for somebody who will fight for them,"" said Rothman, speaking from the Plaza Diner in Bergen County during the video posted April 18 by NorthJersey.com.

""So when people in the middle class wanted their representative to fight for them and not give away the store to the super rich in America, Bill Pascrell voted to eliminate all estate taxes for billionaires, and I voted no.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Rothman’s claim does not have much truth behind it, and it’s deeply misleading.

Pascrell voted in June 2000 for a bill to gradually repeal the federal estate tax. But after President Bill Clinton vetoed the legislation, the congressman reversed his position and rejected the bill about three months later.

Pascrell also opposed subsequent efforts to eliminate the estate tax on at least seven occasions during the administration of President George W. Bush. The estate tax is levied against the transfer of wealth following a person’s death.

Paul Swibinski, a senior advisor to the Rothman campaign, argued the claim is accurate: ""The fact that Bill Pascrell flip flopped and voted both for and against eliminating the estate tax proves that he is not a consistent, reliable supporter of progressive issues.""

First, let’s explain Pascrell’s yes vote in 2000.

In June 2000, Pascrell voted in favor of the Death Tax Elimination Act of 2000, which would have repealed the estate tax by Jan. 1, 2010. Rothman voted against the bill.

The House failed to override Clinton’s veto in September 2000, when Pascrell and Rothman both voted against the bill and overriding the president’s veto.

Pascrell spokesman Sean Darcy told us the congressman originally supported the estate tax repeal in 2000 because at that time, the tax ""put an undue burden on middle class taxpayers like small business owners."" At the time of the override vote, Pascrell noted on the House floor that Clinton would work out a solution to ease the burden on the middle class, Darcy said in an e-mail.

Darcy added: ""True to form, while Bill Pascrell has been fighting for middle class taxpayers on the Ways and Means Committee and the floor of the House, Steve Rothman was nowhere to be found.""

From that point on, the two congressmen continued to oppose estate tax repeal efforts.

In April 2001, Pascrell and Rothman voted against the Death Tax Elimination Act of 2001, a measure to gradually repeal the estate tax. Provisions of that bill were included in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, which Pascrell and Rothman opposed in May 2001.

Signed into law in June 2001, that legislation repealed the estate tax for individuals who die in 2010, and then reinstated it in 2011.

On at least five occasions between 2002 and 2007, the two congressmen voted against permanently repealing the estate tax.

The existing regulations were part of a tax cut deal reached in late 2010 by President Barack Obama and Congress, with Pascrell’s and Rothman’s support.

Our ruling

In a video posted April 18 on YouTube, Rothman claimed ""Bill Pascrell voted to eliminate all estate taxes for billionaires, and I voted no.""

Pascrell did vote in June 2000 for a bill to gradually repeal the estate tax, but after Clinton vetoed the legislation, the congressman reversed his position and rejected the bill in September 2000. In subsequent years, Pascrell voted against repealing the estate tax on at least seven occasions.

Since Rothman’s claim ""ignores critical facts that would give a different impression,"" his statement is Mostly False.

Michael Turner says 'political favoritism and backroom deals' hurt pensions for 20,000 Delphi salaried retirees
","Editor's note: We updated this ruling in September 2013 after a report from the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program issued a report that revealed more about the Treasury Department's involvement. The claim now is rated Half True. The 2009 bailout of General Motors and Chrysler still resonates in political campaigns.

President Barack Obama and his supporters say it helped revive the economies of states like Ohio. Critics including Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, say it saddled taxpayers with loans that still have not been paid back fully, and that market forces, not government intervention, should have been allowed to play out.

We won’t attempt to settle that here.

But there is another still-ripe issue from the bailout, concerning retiree pensions from a major parts supplier. Rep. Michael Turner, a Republican from Dayton, brought it up April 23 while speaking in support of Romney and responding to claims by the Obama team that the auto bailout was a success.

Part of Turner’s rebuttal was this: ""In the process"" of the $80 billion auto rescue, ""20,000 Delphi salaried retirees lost up to 70 percent of their pensions. Governor Romney will make decisions based on what’s best for the economy and for American workers, not based on political favoritism and backroom deals.""

Did 20,000 Delphi salaried employees lose part of their pensions, some as much as 70 percent?

The short and general answer is yes.  

But tacked onto Turner’s statement was a claim of blame:  While salaried and managerial employees of Delphi, a major parts supplier to General Motors, lost part of their pensions, unionized employees did not. The unions got a pension rescue -- which is what Turner, like other critics, meant by ""political favoritism and backroom deals.""

This is a raging complaint among retirees of Delphi, which until 1999 was a GM division. It has turned into a political complaint as well, with the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform holding hearings and federal agencies investigating. Turner is a member of the House committee.

To understand the issue, it helps to have some background.

GM spun off Delphi as an independent company in 1999. It was risky and the unions, particularly the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), knew it, so GM agreed to a guarantee. If Delphi faltered and the union pensions got cut,  GM would ""top up,"" or supplement, those smaller pensions so Delphi retirees could have the retirements they’d always expected. Not every union had this deal, nor did Delphi’s salaried workers.

By making such a promise, GM bought a degree of labor peace and certainty, which was important because of the number of car components Delphi provided. A disruption by Delphi could bring GM production to a halt. Besides, Delphi’s pension plan for salaried workers was fully funded at the time, while it’s plan for hourly workers was not.

Delphi did stumble financially, filing for bankruptcy protection in 2005. Because the company failed to make minimum contributions to its pension plans, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the federal agency that insures pensions, placed liens to protect the pension plan assets. But a few of the unions still did not have to worry about reduced pension payments because of those earlier ""top up"" agreements, and in 2007, Delphi, GM and the unions signed agreements continuing the deals. As the Government Accountability Office noted in a detailed chronology of events, salaried workers still had no such deal.

Delphi at this point was trying to find a buyer, and GM agreed to take control of $3.4 billion in net liabilities from Delphi’s hourly pension plan. But by 2008, the entire auto industry was struggling, and both Delphi and GM were in trouble.

GM sought bankruptcy protection June 1, 2009. The Treasury Department by now was deeply involved, helping GM restructure with the use of government money (and taking stock in the restructured company as collateral). The Obama administration, like GM, wanted Delphi to survive because of its key role as a parts supplier. And both GM and Delphi needed buy-in from the UAW.

So with consent from Treasury, a restructured GM agreed to continue the top-up agreement with Delphi’s UAW workers. By this point, Delphi had turned its pension plans over to the PBGC.

One problem remained. GM also had top-up agreements with two other Delphi unions from the spin-off: the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers (IUE); and the United Steelworkers of America (USWA). Delphi needed consent from those two unions to finalize the sale of its assets to new owners and emerge from bankruptcy. And GM needed a solvent Delphi to keep parts coming to its factories. After reviewing court filings, testimony and other documents in order to provide what is arguably the most dispassionate analysis of the situation, the GAO said:

Treasury wanted to assure the ""sanctity"" of GM’s supply chain with a post-bankruptcy Delphi (which itself was getting new owners). Failure to extend the top-up agreement to the other two unions would have stood in the way. And all three unions had long-standing top-up agreements, which salaried workers never had.

So on Sept. 10, 2009, GM agreed to keep the top-up agreements of all three unions. Salaried workers who spent their careers at Delphi got no such deal, and they have seen their pensions cut. They have been fighting in court ever since, with lawmakers, including Turner, on their side.

Was this political favoritism for the unions? A backroom deal?

In researching this matter, PolitiFact Ohio read congressional testimony, news reports, government studies and websites with claims from all sides. We read allegations about coziness, or lack thereof, of certain players, such as GM and the UAW. But the evidence to date is thin when it comes to claims of unfairness from the Obama administration.

The PBGC, the federal agency that rescues failing pension plans, played no role in influencing the GM decision to support the Delphi pensions through the three unions, according to testimony in November by agency’s deputy director, Vincent K. Snowbarger.

But what about Treasury, which played a central role in negotiations?

The most impartial answer we found was a GAO report from December 2011. It concluded that GM had strategic reasons to keep unionized auto parts workers happy, namely, the need for on-time parts delivery without disruption. But the GAO concluded that the Treasury Department, representing the Obama administration in the bailout, did not unduly influence this portion of the deal. Said the GAO:

""As GM’s primary lender in bankruptcy, Treasury played a significant role in helping GM resolve the Delphi bankruptcy in terms of GM’s interests. Treasury’s guiding principle was to see the bankruptcy resolved with the least possible amount of investment by GM while still preserving GM’s supply chain. However, with regard to GM decisions about the Delphi pension plans — their sponsorship and the decision to honor existing top-up agreements — court filings and statements from GM and Treasury officials support that Treasury deferred to GM’s business judgment.""

This is unlikely to be the end of the matter. The inspector general for the Treasury Department’s Troubled Asset Relief Program is conducting its own audit to determine Treasury’s role in the top-up decision. It wants to know whether the administration or its automotive task force pressured GM to provide additional funding for the union pensions.

That report is expected this summer. Meantime, we return to Turner’s claim:  ""In the process, 20,000 Delphi salaried retirees lost up to 70 percent of their pensions. Gov. Romney will make decisions based on what’s best for the economy and for American workers, not based on political favoritism and backroom deals.""

His statement contains some element of truth. The bad deal for the salaried retirees is not in dispute. Whether it resulted from political favoritism, however, is. And the GAO, the one truly nonpartisan entity to opine so far, suggests otherwise. That’s a critical fact that Turner’s claim ignores.

We may return to this if warranted after the TARP inspector general’s work is done, but right now Turner leaves us with a statement that is accurate only in part. Based on what is known now, Turner’s claim It suggests a government role that neither he nor anyone else has nailed down.

It’s his job to on the House oversight committee to get at the truth, but as a proxy for a presidential campaign, he reached conclusions that the Truth-o-Meter cannot support.

"['Homeland Security', 'Military', 'Texas', 'Chain email']","
Chain email says Homeland Security purchasing many bullets perhaps in anticipation of civil unrest or an invasion
","
Stock up on soup. Account for children and pets. Lock the doors, dim the lights.

A chain email forwarded to us by a reader March 24, 2012, suggests the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has mysteriously ordered a lot of bullets. Specifically, the email says, the department ""has just executed an order for enough rounds of .40 caliber ammunition to kill every man, woman and child in the United States.""

""A shocking new defense contract entered by the 'department' to secure a massive amount of ammunition, with the option for infinite supply and infinite delivery, raising the question of just what they are preparing for?"" the email says. ""Massive civil unrest? An invasion by a foreign power? The order is to supply 450 Million Rounds of .40 Caliber ammunition which is more than one bullet for every single person in the United States.""

Yikes! Might the government be stocking up to battle civil unrest or resist an invasion?

The declared number of bullets certainly exceeds the nation’s population. As of March 2012, according to U.S Census Bureau estimates, the country was home to 313 million people, making the ratio of bullets to residents about 1.4 to 1 -- if the email is firing on all cylinders.

For insight about the .40-caliber bullet, we turned to Jeffrey Magers, a former police officer who teaches at California University of Pennsylvania. Magers said the described bullet is a standard police round used around the country. ""They’re intended to flatten and do the most damage without passing through the body. It’s a shock-effect type of thing,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""It’s intended to stop the threat.""

And did the government agree to buy 450 million rounds?

The chain email links to a March 18, 2012, entry on the conservative Fellowship of the Minds blog referring to a posting on the PR Newswire website. On that site, we pulled up a March 12, 2012, release from Minnesota-based ATK, an aerospace, defense and commercial products company.

The release says ATK has been awarded an ""Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quality"" agreement from Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement for .40 caliber ammunition. ""This contract features a base of 12 months, includes four option years, and will have a maximum volume of 450 million rounds,"" the release says. It adds that ATK already was supplying such ammunition.

The release, noting that deliveries are expected to begin in June 2012, quotes Ron Johnson, president of ATK's Security and Sporting group, saying that the bullet will ""continue to serve those who keep our borders safe.""

Next, we reached Homeland Security spokesman Matthew Chandler who said by email that the cited quantity of up to 450 million rounds is ""the quantity projected to be used over the next five years.""

""This contract is intended to be used by all (agency) components, except"" the U.S. Coast Guard, he said, which uses ammunition obtained through the Defense Department. According to a Homeland Security web page, the agency’s 20-plus components include the Transportation Security Administration, which handles passenger screening at most airports; U.S. Customs and Border Protection, entrusted with keeping terrorists and their weapons out of the country and with enforcing immigration and drug laws; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and the Secret Service.

Chandler’s email continues: ""This contract is part of the department’s strategic sourcing efforts to combine multiple previous contracts in order to leverage the purchasing power of the entire department, including the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center,"" another Homeland Security component, ""which trains nearly all federal law enforcement personnel, to efficiently procure equipment and supplies.""

On its website, the Georgia-based center says it trains law officers for 90 federal agencies and also officers in state, local, tribal, and international law enforcement. Chandler said that in the 12 months through September 2011,  over 11,000 students at the center fired over 11 million rounds of .40 caliber ammunition, primarily in basic training.

Chandler said earlier that Homeland Security oversees more than 135,000 weapons-carrying officers.

Our calculation: If those officers go through all the possible 450 million rounds at the same rate each over five years -- admittedly, an unlikely balance -- each officer will have used about 667 bullets a year.  

Asked how the decision to purchase up to 450 million of the .40-caliber rounds compares to previous Homeland Security buys, Chandler said only that because the 2012 contract combines multiple previous contracts, it is different than ""previous contract vehicles.""

Finally, we talked through the information provided by Homeland Security with Magers who said he believes the arranged-for rounds could be used by domestic law enforcement officers on duty, in training and in keeping their skills up. ""Not only does every officer carry ammunition on their body and in close proximity, but every so often ... they are required to go out and qualify with that weapon. Any one officer is going to account for a lot of rounds in a year,"" Magers said. Also, he said, rounds get cycled out as officers ensure their equipment is ready when needed.

""On its face, the type of ammunition and the amount of ammunition over a five-year period of time doesn’t sound extraordinarily excessive,"" Magers said. Of the chain email’s mention of a bullet for every man, woman and child, he said: ""Whoever came up with this one bullet per person is trying to sensationalize this. That’s borderline irresponsible.""

Our ruling

Homeland Security has contracted to buy up to 450 million .40-caliber bullets -- and that total exceeds the nation’s population. Significantly, though, the purchase contract covers five years; there’s no indication the agency is piling up the bullets in a hurry.

More significantly, we found nothing to support the email’s ominous suggestions. Rather, the large size of the contract is explained as a way for the government to buy in bulk to save money on ammunition used routinely for training officers in a wide variety of agencies.

"['New Jersey', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Taxes', 'Joseph Kyrillos']","
U.S. Senate hopeful Joe Kyrillos claims he “never voted for a tax increase” as a state legislator
","
After two decades as a state senator, Joe Kyrillos has been involved in politics long enough to know one should never say ""never.""

But that’s just what Kyrillos, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, did in this April 17 statement on his campaign website: ""In my years in the State Legislature, I have never voted for a tax increase.""

That’s a bold claim, but as PolitiFact New Jersey found, also an inaccurate one.

Kyrillos, who represents part of Monmouth County, voted in December 1997 to double the tax rates on cigarettes and tobacco products. In more recent years, Kyrillos also has supported some measures labeled by his own Republican colleagues as ""tax increases.""

First, we’ll talk about that tax increase on smokers.

About a month after then-Gov. Christine Whitman won re-election, the Republican-controlled Legislature on Dec. 18, 1997 approved Assembly bill A-2157. That legislation doubled the cigarette tax from 40 cents to 80 cents per pack, and the tobacco products wholesale tax from 24 percent to 48 percent of the wholesale price.

According to the minutes of that day’s proceedings, Kyrillos was one of 33 senators to vote for the bill. The next day, Whitman signed the bill into law. 
Also, in 1998, Kyrillos was a co-sponsor of a bill to increase the gas tax, but since the measure never made it to the Senate floor, Kyrillos didn't get a chance to vote on it. 
That’s good enough to prove Kyrillos’ claim is wrong, but let’s also look at his votes on what his own Republican colleagues have referred to as ""tax increases.""

Over the last several years, the Democrat-led Legislature has approved numerous tax and fee increases -- a subject that Republican legislators frequently criticize. In October, we fact-checked a claim by Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr. that Democrats had increased taxes more than 115 times.

Calling them all ""tax increases,"" a Senate Republican spokesman sent us a list of tax increases, fee hikes and tax policy changes between fiscal years 2003 and 2010.

Kyrillos voted against most of those bills, but not all of them. Here are a couple of examples where -- by his own party’s measure -- Kyrillos supported tax increases:

In January 2008, Kyrillos supported a bill that increased fees and penalties related to handling explosives. In June 2009, Kyrillos voted for legislation that, in part, allowed certain municipalities to impose a tax on car rentals.

It’s worth noting that Kyrillos has rejected certain major tax increases in recent years.

For example, when the Legislature agreed in July 2006 to increase the sales tax to 7 percent and expand it to various transactions, Kyrillos said no. Kyrillos also rejected a measure in June 2009 to temporarily increase certain state income tax rates.

In response to our findings, Kyrillos spokeswoman Meaghan Cronin pointed to the senator’s record of opposing ""broad-based tax increases, such as increases in income, sales and business taxes.""

Cronin cited four of Kyrillos’ specific votes against new or increased taxes. Those measures included the sales tax increase in 2006; a hotel tax in 2003; a business tax increase in 2002; and a tax against health insurers in 2005.

""Most recently, Senator Kyrillos supported Governor Chris Christie’s local 2 percent property tax and spending cap,"" Cronin said in an e-mail, referring to a July 2010 vote in favor of the cap.

Our ruling

In an April 17 message on his campaign website, Kyrillos offered this biographical note: ""In my years in the State Legislature, I have never voted for a tax increase.""

Kyrillos has voted against certain major tax hikes -- such as increasing sales and income taxes -- but the senator is wrong to claim he ""never voted for a tax increase.""

In December 1997, Kyrillos voted to double the tax rates on cigarettes and tobacco products. More recently, Kyrillos has supported some measures labeled by his own Republican colleagues as ""tax increases.""

"['Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Energy', 'Gas Prices', 'National Republican Congressional Committee']","
National Republican Congressional Committee says gas prices have increased by a greater percentage under Obama than any other president since Carter
","
We received an email from the National Republican Congressional Committee recently that blamed the country’s high gas prices on the Obama administration and Democrats in Congress.

The news release, which specifically targeted Rhode Island Democratic U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, posited several reasons why gas prices have skyrocketed, including unreasonable environmental regulations and too few offshore drilling permits.

The overall effect on gas prices has been historic, according to the GOP committee.

""99%: THE AMOUNT GAS PRICES HAVE INCREASED UNDER OBAMA, THE HIGHEST GAS PRICE INCREASE SINCE CARTER,"" the April 20 email blared.

A quick check of two numbers in the release -- $1.928 per gallon, the national average price of regular, unleaded gas in February 2009, versus $3.843 per gallon, the price on March 29, 2012 -- confirmed that prices have indeed climbed by 99 percent since Obama’s inauguration.

But what about the second part of the claim: is this really the highest increase since Jimmy Carter was president more than three decades ago? And is the implication that Obama is responsible for the increase accurate?

At PolitiFact, we treat these types of blame/credit statements in two parts. We examine whether the numbers are right and how much experts say the person being blamed is responsible.

Let’s start with the claim that the gas price increase is the highest since the Carter administration.

Nathaniel Sillin, a spokesman for the NRCC, told us that the group came to that conclusion by looking at the presidencies from Carter onward and comparing the average gas price at the beginning of each president’s time in office with the price at the end. Since Obama is still in office, the committee is using the most recent price of gas for the number during his presidency. Sillin sent us a chart updated with the average price of gas from April 4.

The chart showed that under Carter the price of gas increased by 103 percent; under Ronald Reagan it dropped by 66 percent; under George H.W. Bush it went up 20 percent; under Bill Clinton it increased 32 percent; under George W. Bush it rose 20 percent; and so far under Obama it has gone up 104 percent.

So according to the updated chart the NRCC could actually claim that the increase is higher than that under Carter.

The NRCC chart was based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and AAA. We decided to check their prices with the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the official statistical and analytical arm of the Department of Energy.

The only major difference we found using the EIA data was that the drop in price under Reagan wasn’t as dramatic as the NRCC said. Instead of a 66-percent decrease, the EIA database gave us a still healthy decrease of 37 percent. And using the EIA data, the increase under Obama so far is actually 107 percent.

But we have two main questions about the NRCC’s claim.

First, is it fair to compare gas prices during Obama’s presidency in April to prices for his predecessors in January? Historically, gas prices generally rise through the summer, and fall in the autumn -- and this year they are projected to once again follow that pattern. (The price peaked last year in May.)

For an extreme example, look at 2008, during George W. Bush’s presidency, when gas prices skyrocketed to more than $4 a gallon that July and plummeted to $1.79 a gallon the following January. If we look at the price that April -- the same month the NRCC used for Obama in its claim -- and compare it to the first month of Bush’s term, then the increase would have been 139 percent.

That increase is in fact higher than Carter’s 103 percent or Obama’s 107 percent. And if we use the highest price in 2008, from August, and compare it with Bush’s first month in office, the increase is a whopping 180 percent.

We also calculated the increase using precisely the same length of time for Bush that the NRCC used for Obama. So we compared the price in February 2005, the first month of his second term, to the price in April 2008 and came up with an increase of 81 percent. When we did the same calculation using January 2009 as the end date, we came up with a decrease of 6 percent. Again, this demonstrates how prices can change seasonally.

Our second major question relates to the premise of the NRCC’s assertion -- that Obama is responsible for high gas prices. How much control does a president really have over gas prices?

""Virtually none,"" Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst for Oil Price Information Service of New Jersey, told us. ""The real factors are global.""

""Oil is a global market in which America is a big consumer but a small supplier,"" Richard Thaler, a University of Chicago economist who has donated to Obama and informally advised his administration, wrote in The New York Times. ""We consume about 20 percent of the world’s oil but hold only 2 percent of the oil reserves. That means we are, in economics jargon, ‘price takers.’

""Domestic production has increased during the Obama administration, but it has had minimal effects on global prices because, as producers, we are just too small to matter much. And even if domestic oil companies further increased production, they would sell to the highest global bidder.""

With supplies tightening because of conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East and demand growing in China and Japan (which shut down its fleet of nuclear power plants), the price of oil is going up, according to analysts. Fears about a disruption to oil production in Iran have increased the upward pressure.

""Unfortunately, presidents get blamed for world market changes that occur during their time in office... but generally, they do not cause them,"" wrote Peter Van Doren and Jerry Taylor, senior fellows at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, D.C.

Our ruling

The National Republican Congressional Committee said that gas prices have increased by 99 percent since Obama became president and that it’s ""the highest gas price increase since Carter.""

The NRCC framed the question in such a way that it didn’t make an apples-to-apples comparison between presidencies. Seasonal fluctuations in gas prices could easily change the NRCC’s calculation for Obama’s presidency -- a variation the committee didn’t note in its news release.

It also didn’t say that it was comparing the first and last months of a president’s term. The release implies that gas prices haven’t risen so high percentage-wise at any time under any other president since Carter.

But that’s not true. When George W. Bush was in office, the national average price rose much higher by percent before falling.

Finally, blaming presidents for gas prices is missing the point. Presidents have little control over them. The global economy is the prime factor.

We rule the statement Mostly False.

Recall target Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says worker discrimination law was ""gravy train"" for lawyers
","
When PolitiFact Wisconsin first wrote about an attempt by Republicans to repeal a law that allowed discriminated workers to sue in state court, we found a surprising statistic:

The law had been in effect for nearly three years, but no such lawsuits had been filed.

And yet a month later, days after signing a repeal of the law, GOP Gov. Scott Walker suggested the law had been a financial windfall for attorneys.

""In the past, it was kind of a gravy train for the trial bar,"" the governor told the Wisconsin Radio Network on April 10, 2012.

He added: ""The only change (the repeal) really makes is it no longer includes the benefit that was in place before for lawyers.""

We know Walker stopped the high-speed trains that were headed to Wisconsin. But had there also been a ""gravy train"" running cash to plaintiffs’ attorneys?

Walker’s claim relates to the ""war on women"" that Democrats say Walker and the GOP are waging in the run-up to the June 2012 gubernatorial recall election. So we decided to take a look.

First, two points of background. 
-- In March 2012, we gave a Mostly False to state Rep. Cory Mason, D-Racine, for saying the old law, approved in June 2009 when Democrats controlled Madison, ensured that women could not be paid less than men for doing the same job. Act 20 allowed discriminated workers -- after proving discrimination to a state agency -- to sue their employers in state court for compensatory and punitive damages. Previously, they could sue only in federal court. 
-- On the same day of Walker’s radio interview, we gave Democratic recall candidate Kathleen Falk a False for saying the GOP repeal of the old law meant women ""can’t do something about"" pay discrimination. Discriminated workers can still seek ""make whole"" remedies from state as well as federal agencies. And for most types of discrimination, employees who work for an employer who has 15 or more employees can sue for larger damages in federal court. 
Now to Walker’s claim.

Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie acknowledged that no state court lawsuits were filed while the old law was in effect. So, clearly lawyers weren’t getting paid based on their clients winning discrimination cases in state court.

But Werwie argued that the law was still a ""kind of a gravy train"" for lawyers because they could extract settlements from employers by threatening to sue in state court. Some attorneys who represent workers say the system for suing in state court under the old law was easier and less expensive than suing in federal court, plus it applied to more types of discrimination, so that law gave workers some advantages.

Employers would pay settlements, Werwie said, to avoid perhaps years’ worth of legal fees and the chance of having to pay up to $300,000 (for large employers) in damages if they lost at trial. (The same limits on damages apply to suits filed in federal court.)

Werwie made three points:

1. Old law led to costly settlements

At an October 2011 Senate committee hearing on the Republicans’ repeal legislation -- Act 219 -- Wisconsin Restaurant Association lobbyist Pete Hanson said that shortly after the old law took effect, one restaurant agreed to pay a roughly $50,000 settlement on a claim that typically would have been settled for a fraction of that because of the potential cost of a lawsuit. He said the case had been working its way through the state agency system when the 2009 law took effect.  

However, that example does not quite fit the facts. When the law was passed, it said it could only be applied to future cases -- not those already in the pipeline.

2. Lawyers wanted old law

Werwie cited 2009 testimony in support of the old law by Madison attorney Paul Kinne, who represented the Wisconsin Association for Justice, formerly the Wisconsin Academy of Trial Lawyers. Kinne argued that workers needed the ability to sue in state court in order to fully pursue their discrimination cases.

""Limited damages make it very difficult to bring discrimination cases,"" Kinne wrote. ""Attorneys turn down dozens of cases because damages are limited and most people cannot afford to pay hourly fees.""

Like Werwie’s first point, this one does not provide hard evidence that the law was a financial boon for lawyers.

But both points suggest a more favorable scenario for lawyers under the old law: The threat of a state lawsuit gave plaintiffs more options in bringing a discrimination case against an employer.

3. Lawyers, unions backed old law

Werwie noted that, of six organizations that lobbied for the 2009 law, one was the trial lawyers group and four were unions.

But that, too, does not support the ""gravy train"" statement. The interest of the unions, presumably, was their members who might be discriminated against. And, as was noted from the start, the law did not produce any lawsuits in nearly three years.

Our rating

Walker said a law that allowed workplace discrimination lawsuits to be filed in state court, which he and the Legislature repealed, was ""kind of a gravy train"" for lawyers. His statement contains some element of truth, in that the old law gave another legal option to lawyers who represent workers claiming discrimination.

But Walker’s claim ignores critical facts -- or, put another way, lacks critical facts -- that would support his claim of a big financial gain for lawyers. After all, not a single lawsuit was filed in state court since the law took effect.

In a schools-related online post March 27, his campaign website has more details on how Hales saved the day: ""He helped negotiate the city paying one time for two weeks of school, and the local teachers to work two weeks without pay.""

The statement about negotiating with teachers is repeated in a March 28 KATU questionnaire posted online:

""I’m very proud that as a Portland City Commissioner, I worked with our Mayor and other commissioners to help save the school year when a budget crisis in Salem threatened to cut four weeks of the school year. I worked with our Mayor and school leaders to find emergency funds for half those days while negotiating with our local teachers to work half the days for free.""

PolitiFact Oregon gives an abundance of evidence so you know this isn’t a one-time claim by Hales, who faces chief rivals Eileen Brady and Jefferson Smith in the May 15 election. You should also know that Portland teachers’ union leaders say there’s been just one time in history when they worked for free -- and that was in 2003, when Hales was no longer on council. It was a huge deal.

""That would be erroneous,"" said Ann Nice, former president of the Portland Association of Teachers, of Hales’ claim. ""That was February 2003. It’s etched in my mind forever. I had to stand up to explain to 5,000 people why they should work for free.""

Hales left the council in June 2002 to take a job in the private sector.

In January 2003, voters defeated a temporary statewide income tax increase and Portland Public Schools planned to cut 24 days of school. Before February was over, the county, city, teachers’ union and district had agreed to a contract that preserved those days.

Teachers agreed to work 10 days of the 2002-03 school year without compensation, according to a tentative agreement signed Feb. 25, 2003. Mayor Vera Katz agreed to find money to pay for the remaining school days, and the city and county agreed to develop a longer-term funding package.

Nice recalls meeting on the issue with Commissioner Randy Leonard -- Hales’ successor on council -- and with then-Commissioner Erik Sten. Rounding out talks were Commissioners Jim Francesconi and Dan Saltzman, and of course, Katz.

Contacted by PolitiFact Oregon, Hales immediately owned up to the misstatement on Friday. He said he would issue a correction and pull the television ad from circulation.

""I apologize for not being accurate,"" he said. ""It appears that what happened is I merged in my mind the whole series of times when I voted in office to help schools with another later time when I was advocating for schools but out of office.""

We know what you’re thinking. How could Hales forget where he was? Right?

In his defense, he and his campaign listed a number of votes he took in his decade on the City Council. We researched our in-house library and discovered that Portland Public Schools consistently needed help from the City Council -- which included Hales -- during the 1990s. For example, in 1999 the Oregon Legislature passed a budget that left Portland schools short $14 million.

Nice, the former union leader, attests to Hales’ support while on council.

""There were times when he was helpful with schools things and other times I know where the city helped the school district out, and he was helpful in those scenarios, but he wasn’t on City Council"" when teachers agreed to work two weeks without pay, Nice said.

Hales owned up to the inaccuracy of his statement. We give him and the campaign credit for being so quick to correct the record. But the statement is still flat wrong. We rule the statement False.

Gov. Scott says 230,000 fewer people receive unemployment compensation since he took office
","
A radio host recently asked Gov. Rick Scott for an update on his trademark 7-7-7 plan -- creating 700,000 jobs in seven years in seven steps. (We're tracking that promise on the Scott-O-Meter.)

Scott said Florida’s economy is getting better in a lot of ways.

""We’re doing well. We’re at a three-year low on our unemployment in this state... We generated around 100,000 net jobs so far, if you look at the federal numbers,"" he said in the April 18, 2012, interview with Orlando-based station WDBO. ""But if you look at the state numbers, about 230,000 people that were on unemployment when I took office are not on unemployment now.

""When you look around the state, tourism is up, the home market’s up, home sales are up, home prices are up. … So good things are happening, but we still have 900,000 people out of work,"" he said.

What stuck out to us is his claim that 230,000 fewer people receive unemployment benefits than when he took office 15 months ago. That sounds like a drastic decrease, which Scott is taking credit for and in turn using as evidence that the state’s economy is improving.

A spokeswoman with the state’s Department of Economic Opportunity, the agency that manages the unemployment compensation program, responded to our request about Scott’s claim. Spokeswoman Nancy Blum said the number of people receiving unemployment compensation dropped from 561,736 on Jan. 31, 2011, to 345,052 on March 31, 2012. That’s a total decline of 216,684.

That’s pretty close to ""about 230,000,"" which is the number Scott offered.

Whether Scott is right to take credit for the decline -- and whether that is translating to a better Florida economy -- is more complicated.

In 2011 and 2012, Scott and Florida lawmakers made a series of changes to the state’s unemployment compensation program that generally make it harder for people to receive benefits.

Among them: 
Meanwhile, businesses got tax breaks. A 2012 bill reduces unemployment compensation taxes for businesses by at least $50 per employee, with savings of $276 million the first year.

The Miami Workers Center asked the U.S. Department of Labor’s civil rights division to investigate Florida’s unemployment compensation system over allegations that these changes act as barriers to people who deserve checks but can’t get them for lack of computer access or reading skills. A Labor department spokesman told us the investigation is ongoing.

""The governor’s number in and of itself does not demonstrate any kind of economic recovery in Florida,"" said Valory Greenfield, staff attorney for Florida Legal Services, which represents the workers center. ""What it tells me based on our experience working with claimants is that fewer people who are potentially eligible are getting into the program.""

In fact, since August 2011 the department has denied 131,115 applicants for failing to comply with the new law, mostly for failing to fulfill the work search or the initial skills assessment.

Those denials resulted in a $30.3 million savings. 
Economists said Scott's number, while accurate, isn't necessarily a great economic measure on its own. They also said it's too soon to tell if Florida's more stringent eligibility requirements play a big role in the declining number of recipients. Part of the drop-off could be attributed to people whose benefits have expired. Since December 2011, 30,600 people have exhausted all state and federal unemployment benefits, according to the department.

""So far I haven’t been able to see any hard data or evidence to quantify (either) effect,"" said Mekael Teshome, PNC Financial Services Group economist.

What’s more relevant, Teshome said, is that jobless claims have been coming down since their peak in mid 2009, well before Scott took office. That somewhat undermines the idea that the drop is thanks to Scott. 
In fact, if you started counting in 2010 instead of 2011 when Scott took office, even fewer people -- 300,770 -- are receiving unemployment benefits. 
Some experts also pointed to the contracting size of the labor force, which helps to lower the unemployment rate but also indicates some people are no longer looking for work. About 15,000 people left the labor force from February, according to the state’s March 2012 labor report. 
The 15,000-person drop in the labor force was part of the reason why the unemployment rate fall from 9.4 percent in February to 9 percent in March.

""Some of those are people whose benefits ran out and are now not looking for work,"" said Chris McCarty, director of the University of Florida’s Bureau of Economic and Business Research. ""Some of those are retirees who have left the labor force permanently.""

Our ruling

Scott’s claim that 230,000 fewer people are receiving unemployment benefits than when he entered office is pretty close to the actual drop (216,684). 
A couple of caveats here. The figure is not completely an indicator that the economy is improving, as Scott suggests, and is somewhat the result of a strict new state law. Also, the trend of jobless claims started falling in mid 2009, more than a year before Scott took office. That undercuts, to a point, the suggestion Scott should get the credit. 
Scott’s statement is accurate but can use some additional information. That’s our definition of Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/apr/27/rick-scott/gov-scott-says-230000-fewer-people-receive-unemplo/
"['Legal Issues', 'States', 'Texas', 'Ron Paul']","
Ron Paul says 40,000 new laws were ""put on the books"" on the first day of 2012
","
Campaigning in his home state of Texas, Republican presidential hopeful Ron Paul told a crowd at Texas A&M University that he thinks the country is moving in the wrong direction.

In addition to saying that the nation has ""too much tyranny,"" the Lake Jackson congressman criticized the number of people behind bars, saying he doesn’t think that’s a reflection of how ""bad"" Americans are. His explanation: ""I think we have way too many laws on the books is what I think. Just on Jan. 1 of this year, there were 40,000 new laws put on the books in one day.""

Paul went on to say that he would like to be the first president to ""get rid of 40,000 laws,"" following up with a verbal walloping of the daily-published Federal Register, where proposed and new regulations are listed. He called the publication incomprehensible and said it should be shrinking, not growing.

We wondered whether Paul was correct about the number of laws that went into effect on the first day of 2012.

A quick Google search led us to the likely basis of such a figure. In a Dec. 27, 2011, press release, the National Conference of State Legislatures said U.S. states and territories passed more than 40,000 bills and resolutions into law in 2011. Yet, the release also said, laws do not always take effect at the start of a year. 
When we inquired about Paul’s statement, campaign spokesman Gary Howard told us he thought Paul ""was including regulations found in the Federal Register."" That seemed a possibility given the next part of his remarks.

If so, though, Paul’s count was way off.

James Gattuso, a senior fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told us that typically, the number of federal regulations put in place in a single year — and not all at the start of each year — ranges from 3,000 to 4,000, all of which are published in the Federal Register.

Susan Dudley, director of George Washington University’s Regulatory Studies Center who served as administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under President George W. Bush, concurred with Gattuso’s figure. She pointed us to a chart posted on the Federal Register’s website that lists the number of new and proposed rules by year, starting in 1976. The 2011 total was 3,807. According to the data, the 1970s and 1980s were the high mark for regulations, when the total number of rules put in place were in the 6,000s and 7,000s.

Dudley said those figures represent the most comprehensive statistics on federal regulations, big and small, from agencies throughout the government.

Adding the number of proposed rules doesn’t bring the total much closer to 40,000. In 2011, according to the data, there were 2,898 proposed rules, for a new and proposed regulation total of 6,705. And, again, that’s for the whole year, not a single day.

What if we include the number of federal laws effective Jan. 1, 2012?

We didn’t find an easy way to count the number of federal laws, if any, that went into effect then. Some legislation that is signed by the president specifies a future date that it will become effective while others take effect as soon as the president signs them. Also, the impact of some laws is not felt until a federal agency issues corresponding regulations.

However, there’s no indication that the number is anywhere close to 40,000.

According to the White House website, President Barack Obama signed into law eight pieces of legislation in the nine days before Jan. 1, 2012, including a major appropriations bill and one that included a two-month extension of a payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits.

Also, the Congressional Record of Jan. 3, 2012 says that in the previous 12 months, about 80 bills had become law.

State legislatures, meanwhile, were much more active.

The National Conference of State Legislatures’ news release, noting that ""laws do not always become effective on Jan. 1,"" detailed some that did. A taste: Laws requiring businesses to enroll in the federal E-Verify program to determine the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States were set to go into effect in  Louisiana, Tennessee, South Carolina and Georgia, according to the release. Also, same-sex couples in Delaware and Hawaii earned the right to enter into civil unions.

In a telephone interview and via email, Meagan Dorsch, a conference spokeswoman, told us that the group’s researchers based its 40,000 figure on data they keep themselves through bill tracking, though they did not pin down exactly how many of those 40,000 pieces of legislation became effective the first day of 2012.

Another hitch: We noticed that the 40,000 total includes both bills that have passed into law and resolutions, which often lack the significance of statutes. In its glossary of legislative terms, the NCSL defines a resolution as a document that ""expresses the sentiment or intent of the legislature or a chamber, that governs the business of the legislature or a chamber, or that expresses recognition by the legislature or a chamber."" 
A snapshot: In 2011, Texas Gov. Rick Perry signed 129 concurrent resolutions sent to him by lawmakers, ranging from one memorializing the late Gov. Dolph Briscoe Jr. to another instructing a clerk to make technical corrections to Senate Bill 1420, which had to do with the Texas Department of Transportation.

We asked Dorsch for a breakdown of the 40,000 figure by resolution and bill. She said the group did not separate bills from resolutions in making its count.

Finally, we found two other entities with information on state-level bills passing into law.

The Council of State Governments, based in Lexington, Ky., publishes data on the number of bills and resolutions that states enact each year. Information for 2011 isn’t ready yet, but for some perspective, we checked out 2010. Corralling only bills enacted by state legislatures and not vetoed by the governor, we counted 14,227.

A couple of notes on these figures: First, five states, including Texas, didn’t have regular legislative sessions in 2010. Second, setting aside enacted resolutions may overlook some that have the force of law or would be considered substantive, like proposed constitutional amendments.

If resolutions approved during 2010 regular and special sessions are included in our count, the total rises by about 13,000 — to 27,240. A note about these figures: The council had no information on resolutions for seven of the states that held regular sessions in 2010.

Finally, we enlisted StateScape — a research firm in Alexandria, Va., that says it collects every measure introduced by state legislatures. Chad Robinson, the firm’s research director, told us by email that its data shows that legislatures enacted 18,562 bills, excluding non-statutory resolutions, in 2011, a year when all state legislatures convened.

That’s less than half of 40,000.

And it could even be that states are starting to approve fewer new laws. Robinson said by telephone that according to the firm's data, more bills passed into law in the previous two odd-numbered years when every state legislature was in session -- 20,238 bills passed into law in 2009 and 21,031 bills passed into law in 2007.

Our ruling

Our sense is that Paul’s figure originated in the NCSL press release saying that legislatures in 2011 passed more than 40,000 bills and resolutions into law. From the top, Paul's reference is a little misleading, considering that he was stumping for federal office and followed his statement by railing against the Federal Register. Clarification is needed.

Most significantly, it looks like 40,000 proposals did not pass into law, not in all of 2011 and certainly not on a single day, contrary to Paul's statement. Also, it looks like many of the proposals were non-statutory resolutions.

We rate Paul's claim as False.",/factchecks/2012/apr/27/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-40000-new-laws-were-put-books-first-/

Facebook post says Romney's top donors come from Wall Street, Obama's from tech and academia
","
A reader recently sent us a Facebook post that put photographs of Mitt Romney and Barack Obama side by side to make a point about their biggest campaign donors.

The post is headlined, ""Top 5 campaign contributors."" For Romney, it lists, ""1) Goldman Sachs, 2) JPMorgan Chase, 3) Morgan Stanley, 4) Credit Suisse Group (financial group headquartered in Zurich), 5) Citigroup.""

For Obama, it lists, ""1) Microsoft, 2) DLA Piper (legal group specializing in technology), 3) Google, 4) University of California, 5) Harvard University.""

Presumably, the point of the post is that Romney is tied to Wall Street interests, whereas Obama is tied to the technology and academic sectors. (The post says, ""The list speaks for itself we think."")

The undated post attributes the information to OpenSecrets.org, a nonpartisan website that includes a campaign finance database. So that’s where we went to verify the information.

Campaign finance rankings change as new donations come in and are recorded in the database, so the accuracy might depend on how recently the Facebook list was compiled.

It turns out that, as of April 27, 2012, OpenSecrets.org’s ""top contributors"" lists closely matched the Facebook post for both candidates.

Here’s Romney’s top six:

1. Goldman Sachs ($564,580)
2. JPMorgan Chase & Co. ($400,675)
3. Bank of America ($364,850)
4. Morgan Stanley ($363,550)
5. Credit Suisse Group ($316,160)
6. Citigroup Inc ($286,015)

So, five of the six top ""contributors"" to Romney were identical on the two lists, and the new addition was Bank of America, another financial institution.

Here’s Obama’s top six:

1. Microsoft Corp. ($304,690)
2. DLA Piper ($302,527)
3. University of California ($243,486)
4. Sidley Austin LLP ($234,611)
5. Google Inc. ($191,719)
6. Harvard University ($177,408)

Once again, five of the six match, with the newcomer to the list -- Sidley Austin LLP -- a law and lobbying firm.

There are two problems with the lists, however.

The first is that it’s not really accurate to call DLA Piper a ""legal group specializing in technology."" It’s a global law firm that also does lobbying; its law and lobbying clients are widely scattered in various industries and sectors and it has 4,200 lawyers in 77 offices in 31 countries.

The firm does represent some technology clients, but in the past few years, it has also filed lobbying disclosure forms for its representation of energy companies, drugmakers, food companies, defense contractors, hotel chains and a grab bag of others, from the PGA Tour to General Cigar Holdings to Snowsports Industries America.

In fact, DLA Piper even signed up to lobby for several financial-industry firms of the type that the Facebook post seemingly criticizes Romney for representing. They include Discover Financial Services, Charles Schwab Corp. and the now-defunct Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers.

The second problem is broader. The Facebook post makes it sound like the groups listed for each candidate actually gave money to the campaign. But corporations are prohibited from making direct contributions to candidate committees such as Romney's and Obama's.

OpenSecrets.org makes the following note on the charts and marks it in red, italic type for emphasis: ""The organizations themselves did not donate, rather the money came from the organizations' PACs, their individual members or employees or owners, and those individuals' immediate families.""

So what these top-contributors lists show is not that Google gave money to Obama, but that employees of Google gave money of their own volition, either directly or through a company-sponsored political action committee.

Our ruling

Even though the post may have been several months old by the time we checked it, the list of each candidate’s top contributors was pretty accurate, although it doesn't quite match the latest version from OpenSecrets. But the Facebook post doesn’t accurately describe what the list means. First, it incorrectly labels one of Obama’s donors. Second, the companies and colleges did not donate to Obama and Romney; their employees or related PACs did, which is an important detail. On balance, we rate the post Half True.",/factchecks/2012/apr/27/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-romneys-top-donors-come/
