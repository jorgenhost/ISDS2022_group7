GOP challenger Zelenik says Diane Black voted to fund health-care reform
","
  
More than two years after they became the law of the land, President Barack Obama’s health-care reforms are still providing fodder for congressional candidates across the country.

One place where that is especially true is in Tennessee’s 6th Congressional District, where U.S. Rep. Diane Black, R-Gallatin, is embroiled in a Middle Tennessee slugfest with her GOP challenger, Lou Ann Zelenik. The race, a rematch from two years ago, is once again among the most closely watched political contests in the state.

Both candidates oppose the health reforms. But Zelenik has not only questioned Black’s commitment to the cause, she and her aides have even suggested in campaign appearances, ads and news releases that Black has been deceptive about her record on health reform.

""Diane Black voted to fund Obamacare, then she voted to repeal it. I guess she was for it before she was against it,"" Zelenik says in a radio ad.

Zelenik’s campaign says the claim is based on Black’s votes on a series of short-term funding measures, known as ""continuing resolutions,"" which keep the government running at current funding levels.

Zelenik’s campaign manager, Jay Heine, noted that two other outspoken opponents of health-care reform -- U.S. Reps. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and Steve King, R-Iowa -- have voted against the continuing resolutions on the grounds that they would allow the health-care funding to continue.

""We are criticizing our opponent for not joining them and voting against these bills,"" Heine said.

By voting in favor of the resolutions, Black is allowing ""the status quo"" to happen and funding for the health reforms to continue, Heine said.

""Our opinion,"" Heine said, ""is that the status quo is not acceptable.""

Black’s campaign spokeswoman, Jennifer Baker, countered that the first-term congresswoman has voted numerous times to cut off funding for the health-care reforms.

Baker provided us with a list of more than two dozen amendments and bills that Black has supported that would either repeal the health-reform law in its entirety, dismantle parts of it or block mandatory funding for the law.

Black was not even in Congress when the House gave final approval to the health-reform bill in March 2010. Yet Zelenik is ""leaving voters with the impression that Diane Black has actively voted to fund Obamacare,"" said Baker, who calls such a claim ridiculous.

At the heart of the dispute is how the health-care law was funded.

The law includes two kinds of budgetary provisions for the new entities created by or through the legislation, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service noted in a report on July 18, 2012.

The law bypassed the normal appropriations process and provided nearly $105 billion in mandatory funding, or ""direct spending"" as it’s known in budget parlance, over a number of years for some of the new programs. Put simply, that means money for the programs is included in the law and that it must be spent on those programs.

Other provisions authorized appropriations for the new programs but did not provide the money directly. In these cases, funding must be provided through subsequent congressional votes during the annual appropriations process, when specific budgetary resources being provided are determined. That is how the appropriations process usually works.

The $105 billion in mandatory funding is automatic and cannot be stopped unless Congress specifically votes to end it. King offered an amendment to do just that in February 2011, but the GOP-controlled House Rules Committee concluded the measure violated the rules for spending bills. The committee blocked the bill from receiving a vote on the House floor.

Bachmann has since offered legislation to convert the mandatory spending to an authorization, which would allow Congress to stop it. Black is one of 96 cosponsors of that legislation, which has not yet received a vote on the House floor.

Unlike Bachmann and King, Black did vote for series of short-term ""continuing resolutions"" to fund the government at existing levels.

But is a vote in favor of the ""continuing resolutions"" really tantamount to voting to fund Obamacare?

The resolutions are not a direct vote on the health-reform funding. In fact, we could find no mention of the health reforms anywhere in the resolutions. Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute watches Congress very closely and he said Zelenik’s claim is ""not credible.""

""I find the charge absurd,"" he wrote in an email. ""Voting to keep the government running -- which means keeping DOD (Department of Defense) in operation, keeping the Social Security checks coming, keeping the air traffic system operating, and so on -- is not tantamount to voting for health care. It is a huge stretch.""

Zelenik’s campaign insists that since the short-term ""continuing resolutions"" allow funding for all government programs, including those created and funded under the health-reform law, Black is guilty of failing to block funding.

""Our standpoint is Congress has the ability to defund or fund anything – that is where the spending authority from the federal government originates from,"" Heine said. ""Our standpoint is our opponent needs to take a stronger stance on this and work to defund it.""

PolitiFact has looked at claims that a vote for a state budget that included stimulus funding was tantamount to approving ""Obama stimulus spending."" One such recent claim in a Republican congressional primary in Florida resulted in a Pants On Fire! ruling for Congressman John Mica.

Our ruling

The public record shows Rep. Black has voted more than two dozen times to repeal President Obama’s health-care reforms and defund them. In claiming Black has actually voted to fund the health reforms, Zelenik and her aides point to Black’s votes on short-term spending measures that continue funding at current levels for all government programs.

But was Black really very specifically ""voting to fund Obamacare"" or was she voting to keep the government from shutting down? Black has strongly opposed the health-care laws and Zelenik’s claim is a distortion designed to deliberately mislead voters about Black’s record.

Texas group says PolitiFact validated criminal history claims about Adan Ballesteros
","
In a July 26, 2012, email blast, a political group backing Michael Cargill for a Travis County constable post asserts that Cargill’s opponent in the July 31 Democratic primary runoff, incumbent Adan Ballesteros, has been stealing anti-Ballesteros signs.

We’re not wading into signs being hoisted. But we fired up the Truth-O-Meter for the email’s citation of PolitiFact.

The email from Texans for Accountable Government, which says it’s focused on reining in the reach of government, says that its anti-Ballesteros website, CocaineConstable.com, brings to light Ballesteros’ ""criminal history -- including being fired from (the Texas Department of Public Safety) for allowing the trafficking of drugs and taking money from informants, the Texas Public Safety Commission sustaining the firing, and his lawsuit against them being thrown out of court for being 'baseless and retaliatory.'""

The email continues: ""TAG's claims were validated and independently documented recently by PolitiFact.com,"" the email says.

Do what?

We figured that this part was referring to our June 25, 2012, article on another group’s claim that Ballesteros, the county’s Precinct 2 constable, had ""accepted more than $15,000 in cocaine blood money.""

Unlike most of our fact-checks, we ended up being unable to rate that claim.

Our 2,200-word story says that the DPS dismissed Ballesteros as an employee in 1998 after seeing merit in a complaint that, years earlier, he had accepted thousands of dollars in illicit funds from a drug smuggler/informant -- a firing upheld by the Texas Public Safety Commission. However, a Texas Workforce Commission tribunal later said a grand jury found no probable cause to indict Ballesteros and also said ""there is not a preponderance of evidence before this appeal tribunal to find the claimant guilty of criminal acts.""

The July 26 email blast makes no mention of the tribunal’s statement or of the fact that Ballesteros was not charged in criminal court.

Ballesteros, who has consistently said he did not accept such funds, told us in an interview that he was investigated and fired because he refused to fire a secretary who had made sexual harassment allegations against a DPS employee. He said that he was ordered to fire the woman shortly after moving to Austin to lead DPS’s narcotics training unit in 1993 — two years before the investigation into his activities as a narcotics investigator in South Texas began.
   
Ballesteros made the same claim in a lawsuit he filed against the DPS. U.S. District Judge James Nowlin dismissed the suit on Sept. 20, 2000, saying in his order that Ballesteros failed to offer relevant evidence. On April 2, 2001, a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the order, writing that Ballesteros had failed to offer evidence that the DPS investigation was ""baseless and motivated by retaliatory intent,"" as mentioned in the email blast.

By telephone, we asked the group’s executive director, Heather Fazio, to elaborate on PolitiFact validating its claims, as the email says.

Fazio said the reference was solely to our reporting on Ballesteros getting fired by the DPS for allegedly letting drugs into the country and taking illicit money; his firing being upheld; and his post-firing lawsuit being judged baseless.

Fazio said the validation reference was not intended to say PolitiFact had confirmed the entire CocaineConstable site.

Asked about the email’s reference to Ballesteros’ ""criminal history"" despite the fact he was not indicted, Fazio replied: ""If you were fired for something that is a criminal act, just because you were not indicted doesn’t mean you were not involved in criminal activity."" Beyond that, she said, the ""criminal history"" term reflected the group’s opinion and was not intended to signal that PolitiFact validated as much. If recipients reach such a conclusion, she said, ""I guess I have to apologize for that part.""

Our ruling

As the group’s email suggests, our story that was the basis of the email’s PolitiFact reference sketches out the complaint and investigation that preceded Ballesteros’ firing and the fact that the firing was upheld and his lawsuit found baseless.

However, we did not validate Ballesteros’ ""criminal history,"" as the group’s email can be read, and the group’s statement fails to point out he was not indicted or that the workforce commission tribunal saw no preponderance of evidence of criminal acts.

Broadly, the group indicates we reached a conclusion about Ballesteros being a criminal that we did not reach. The claim rates Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/jul/27/texans-accountable-government/texas-group-says-politifact-validated-criminal-his/

GOP Wisconsin U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy spent tax money on car for personal use, left-leaning blogger says
","
The website of a left-leaning Washington, D.C., think tank broke some news on July 16, 2012, with an article headlined:

""Seven Tea Party freshmen spent more than $100,000 in taxpayer money on personal cars.""

The word that has the most mileage with voters: personal.

U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., the former prosecutor and onetime reality TV show star, was cited among the seven who ""spent an average of $15,000 on cars for themselves.""

Has Duffy been taking taxpayers for a ride?

The article

Reporter Scott Keyes of ThinkProgress.org, a website of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, wrote the article. It attracted coverage from WisPolitics.com, and was criticized by the Democratic Party of Wisconsin and by former state lawmaker Pat Kreitlow, Duffy’s Democratic opponent in the November 2012 election.

PolitiFact Wisconsin once before evaluated an article by Keyes, in September 2011, when we rated as Mostly False his intriguing claim that the Green Bay Packers ""are a socialist organization.""

Keyes’ cars article said statements of disbursements from the U.S. House of Representatives show Duffy has spent $24,525 on a ""car"" since taking office in January 2011. That’s about $56 less than U.S. Rep. Chip Cravaack, R-Minn., the top spender among the seven congressmen singled out in the article.

The article says Cravaack is leasing for more than $1,000 a month a 2011 Chevy Equinox, a small SUV crossover, but doesn’t say what Duffy has.

So, Keyes’ article cites congressional records in claiming that Duffy spent more than $24,000 in tax dollars on a car for personal use, but provides absolutely no evidence of what type of vehicle Duffy has or whether it’s for himself.

Reaction

Duffy spokesman John Gentzel said Duffy did, as the article says, spend $24,525 -- but that’s for an 18-month lease of a 2001 Chevy Champion bus that is utilized as a mobile office.

Gentzel said the converted five-seat bus is used only by staff to provide constituent services around the 7th Congressional District in northwestern Wisconsin, which he said is the largest in Wisconsin and the second-largest east of the Mississippi River. It includes Wausau and points south, goes west to Eau Claire and runs northwest almost to Duluth, Minn.

Only four staffers have been authorized and insured to drive the bus, and Duffy has never driven it, Gentzel said. Indeed, he rarely rides in it, Gentzel said.

The vehicle has made 230 stops in all 20 of the district’s counties since it was put into service in July 2011, and makes visits on a posted schedule.

""It’d be a flat-out lie to suggest or imply (Duffy) has ever driven it or used it as a personal vehicle,"" he said.

So, Keyes is way off when he wrote that Duffy leased a car for personal use.

When we went back to Keyes, he said Duffy’s office hadn’t replied to a request for comment before his article was published. After it was published, Keyes attached to the article a Duffy news release refuting what the article said about Duffy.

Keyes also told us in an email:

""I take Duffy at his word on the matter and wish his staff had been more forthright on the matter initially. The larger point of hypocrisy remains, though. If he's going to use budget deficits to justify taking food stamps away from poor people, he should at a minimum be willing to lead by example in eschewing his own office expenses (like many of his GOP colleagues who represent much larger districts have done).""

Our rating

Keyes accused Duffy of using tax money for a car for personal use, saying he is among seven ""Tea Party freshmen"" who ""spent an average of $15,000 on cars for themselves."" 

But Duffy leases a bus that is used as a ""mobile office,"" not a car for himself.

That makes the claim about Duffy false and ridiculous and leaves Keyes at this destination: Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2012/jul/27/scott-keyes/gop-wisconsin-us-rep-sean-duffy-spent-tax-money/

Rush Holt claims more than 80 Americans are killed by gunfire every day
","
U.S. Rep. Rush Holt said he can’t see the logic in opposing laws governing firearm safety when dozens of people die from gunfire every day.

On July 20, the day a 24-year-old man opened fire in an Aurora, Colo., movie theater killing 12 people and wounding 58 others, Holt, a Democrat, sent out an e-mail newsletter stating, ""as we watch the news from Colorado with horror and sympathy for the families, we should remember that each day more than 80 Americans are killed by gunfire, unnecessary tragedies. Arguments that gun safety legislation won’t help the situation seem to me illogical or blindly ideological.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found Holt’s statistic is relatively accurate, but only if suicides count as being ""killed by gunfire.""

PolitiFact National recently dug into a similar statement that had been posted on Facebook: ""Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That's 270 people a day and 87 dead.""

That claim landed at Mostly True on the Truth-O-Meter because the numbers were largely right but needed additional context. Saying ""nearly 100,000 people get shot every year"" suggests a person is being shot by someone else, but self-inflicted injuries represent a significant portion of that figure.

Holt’s statement takes the Facebook post a step further by tying the gun deaths statistic in with comments about the Colorado shooting, strengthening the impression that the number he cites represents Americans killed by a gun in the hands of someone other than themselves.

When suicides are removed from the count, the number of individuals killed by guns each day drops off steeply, we found.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks the causes of fatalities for residents of the United States. In 2009 -- the most recent data available -- 31,347 people died in firearm-related incidents.

Suicides represent nearly 60 percent (18,735) of those gun-related deaths, while homicides make up nearly 37 percent (11,493). The rest of the fatalities fall into three categories:  unintentional (554), undetermined (232) or legal intervention/war (333).

Overall, about 86 people die daily across the nation in firearm-related incidents. That figure drops to roughly 35 people a day when suicides are eliminated from the count. About 32 people die daily in homicides.

We asked Thomas Seay, the congressman’s spokesman, to explain why Holt used a statistic increased significantly by suicides to make a point about gun safety legislation after a mass shooting.

Seay said in an e-mail that ""you’re right to point out that gun deaths take many different forms. Gunfire kills people in mass shootings, as in the evil acts in Colorado. Gunfire kills people in isolated murders. Gunfire kills people in accidents. And in many cases, people use gunfire to kill themselves. Almost all of these deaths are tragic and the cause of family grieving, so as we grieve with the families of Aurora, there are many other families whom we should not forget.""

The questions of what to do about potential future deaths and injury should be confronted, examined, and answered, but we should start with an understanding of the problem: more than 80 deaths by gunfire each day.""

Our ruling

Holt said, ""As we watch the news from Colorado with horror and sympathy for the families, we should remember that each day more than 80 Americans are killed by gunfire, unnecessary tragedies.""

It’s true that more than 80 people died daily in firearm-related incidents, according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Suicides represent a significant majority of that figure and that’s an important detail Holt’s statement lacks. While commenting on a mass shooting, he cites a statistic inflated by individuals who took their own lives. Saying more than 80 Americans are ""killed by gunfire"" each day in this context suggests those victims were shot by somebody else, not themselves.

Still, it is true that guns are involved in more than 80 deaths a day nationwide.

Overall, we rate this claim Half True.

"['State Budget', 'Virginia', 'Tim Kaine']","
Tim Kaine says general fund budget shrank when he was governor
","
During a recent debate with Republican George Allen, Democrat Tim Kaine maintained that he is the true spending hawk in Virginia’s U.S. senate race.

As proof, Kaine cited budget cuts he made as Virginia’s governor.

""I ended up my time as governor with a general fund budget that was smaller than the one I started with,"" he said during a July 21 debate in Hot Springs.

We decided to examine Kaine’s claim.

The general fund supports public education, health programs and public safety. Most of its money comes from state incomes and sales taxes.

When Kaine became governor in January 2006, he inherited a $15.1 billion general fund budget for the 2005-06 fiscal year that started the previous July 1. The economy was healthy at the start of Kaine’s term, and the fund stood at $17 billion during each of the next two budget years.

Then Virginia, like the rest of the country, slid into recession and tax revenues plummeted. The general fund dropped to $16.2 billion during the budget year that started in July 2008. At the end of his term in January 2010, the general fund shrank to $14.8 billion.

Before leaving office, Kaine proposed a farewell budget that kept the general fund at $14.8 billion for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010.

So the general fund decreased by $300 million -- or 2 percent -- from the start to the end of Kaine’s administration.

Despite the reduction, the state was spending more money on general fund programs at the end of Kaine’s term than at the beginning.

That’s because the state used federal stimulus money to support some general fund programs during the recession. Virginia did not count the one-time stimulus money as part of the general fund.  

Virginia propped up general fund programs with $1.5 billion of stimulus money during fiscal 2009-10, and $1 billion of stimulus in 2010-11, according to a study by the state’s Joint Legislative Audit Review Committee.

If those stimulus funds are combined with the budget figures, the state spent $16.3 billion on general fund programs during the 2009-10 budget that was in effect at the end of Kaine’s term.  That translates to a 7.9 percent increase in general fund spending from the start to the end of Kaine’s term.  Adjusted for inflation, total spending on general fund programs -- including stimulus money -- was essentially the same at the start and end of Kaine’s term.

When the stimulus money ran out in 2012, the state began feeling the full brunt of budget cuts Kaine and the General Assembly approved.

Under the six governors that preceded Kaine, the general fund budget grew by an average 33.8 percent -- not adjusted inflation -- from the day they came to office to the day they left. This figure does not include the spending levels each governor proposed in their budgets for the fiscal year that would begin six months after their terms ended.

Our ruling

Kaine said the general fund budget was smaller at the end of his gubernatorial term than at the start.

The raw numbers hold up his claim: The general fund budget was $15.1 billion when Kaine took office and $14.8 billion when he left. These figures don’t include $1.5 billion in federal stimulus money the state used to support general fund programs during Kaine’s last year. But this does not detract from Kaine’s claim. Virginia did not count the one-time stimulus money as part of the general fund, which mainly consists of income and sales tax revenues. And when the stimulus ran out, there was no backfill for the budget cuts Kaine endorsed.

We rate Kaine’s statement True.",/factchecks/2012/jul/27/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-general-fund-budget-shrank-when-he-/

Transportatioplan tax foe says plan hikes prices on food, medicine
","
Opponents of a 1 percent sales tax to overhaul the region’s roads and rail are saying the plan will make it harder for metro Atlantans to buy the things they need the most.

It’s downright unfair, said state Sen. Vincent Fort, a Democrat who represents a district that stretches from East Point through parts of Atlanta. The proposal goes before voters on Tuesday.

""We shouldn't be putting a sales tax on people's food and medicine,"" Fort said in a television news story that aired on CBS Atlanta (WGCL-TV) on July 21.

Your PolitiFact Georgia reporters have vetted nearly two dozen claims about the upcoming penny-per-dollar tax, which would raise an estimated $8.5 billion (after inflation) for transportation projects over the next 10 years.

But we hadn’t heard Fort’s claim. Will the transportation tax really increase taxes on food and medicine?

""It’s not in dispute,"" Fort told PolitiFact Georgia.

Fort said his statement referred to groceries and over-the-counter medicine, and that he was uncertain whether prescription drugs would be taxed under the plan. Later, he called us back to say that a legislative staffer informed him that prescription drugs were exempt.

We reviewed state law and consulted with a spokesman for the Georgia Department of Revenue to check Fort’s account.

The tax referendum was born out of Georgia’s Transportation Investment Act of 2010, otherwise known as House Bill 277. The bill divided the state into 12 regions so that voters could decide whether to add a 1 percent sales tax to pay for local transportation system upgrades.

These regional taxes would have to meet certain criteria, the bill said.

One is that the tax would apply to the sale of food and beverages. The sale of ""food and food ingredients to an individual consumer for off-premises human consumption"" is exempted from the state’s sales tax, but local governments may tax it.

Another criteria is that other existing sales tax exemptions would apply. Under current state law, prescription drugs are exempt.

The transportation plan would therefore impose a regional tax on groceries such as a loaf of bread or bananas.  

It also would tax over-the-counter medications such as the aspirin you took for the headache you got from listening to the transportation debate rhetoric. But prescription drugs would remain tax-free.

While the bill specifies that groceries will be taxed, it makes sure other items are not.

Jet fuel is exempt, as is fuel used for off-road, heavy-duty equipment or locomotives. So are motor fuel and energy used during manufacturing.

Fort’s claim holds up well. ""Food and medicine"" would be taxed under the new plan, just not prescription drugs.

Fort got the important stuff right, but he could have been a little more precise and said ""non-prescription medicine.""

Mike Dovilla touts his ""big ideas"" like expanding the film credit as reason for Ohio job creation
","
After seizing control of the Ohio House of Representatives two years ago, Republicans are now working to maintain, and even stretch, their considerable majority over House Democrats in the Nov. 6 election.

Among the closely watched House races is a rematch between Republican incumbent Mike Dovilla and Democrat Matt Patten to represent a district that includes Strongsville, Berea and a few other suburbs.

Dovilla, a Navy veteran and a small business owner, could be vulnerable because he voted in favor of Senate Bill 5 – the bill to restrict public workers’ collective bargaining power that voters ultimately repealed – and because the 18th House District has a solid mix of Democratic and Republican voters.

With an eye on keeping his seat, Dovilla has begun distributing campaign literature that touts the achievements of his first term in office.

""Mike Dovilla’s big ideas like expanding the Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit, which helped bring films like ‘The Avengers’ to Cleveland, have helped make our state No. 1 in the Midwest for job creation,"" a piece of his recent campaign literature said.

""The Avengers"" is one of the highest grossing films of all time and had a positive impact on the local economy. A study commissioned by the Greater Cleveland Film Commission estimated the movie spent $25 million in Ohio and employed more than 3,870 state residents.

But is Dovilla claiming a role with landing the film in Ohio? PolitiFact Ohio decided to check into his claim.

When the movie tax credit was established in 2009, Dovilla was not in office.

Lawmakers included the movie tax credit in the state budget passed that year. As a result, producers for ""The Avengers""  chose to film part of the movie in Cleveland and ended up receiving tax credits created worth about $6.7 million, according to the Ohio Department of Development.

Dovilla didn’t take office until 2011. Although he had nothing to do with creating the initial movie tax credit, he did sponsor legislation this year to expand the program. The expansion doubled the money available through the credit from $10 million per year to $20 million per year.

When we contacted Dovilla to explain his claim, he said the campaign literature was not meant to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the expansion of the movie tax credit and the decision to film part of ""The Avengers"" in Cleveland.

""It says the tax credit helped bring films like ‘The Avengers’ to Cleveland, not the expansion,"" he said.

Dovilla said the phrase ""which helped bring films like ‘The Avengers’ to Cleveland"" referred to the tax credit itself, not the expansion of the tax credit.

Dovilla also said he believes the average person in his district would know that the Avengers was filmed in Cleveland well before lawmakers extended the tax credit and, therefore, the average person would understand that the original movie tax credit – passed before Dovilla took office – brought the Avengers to Cleveland, not the expansion that he sponsored.

Mike Dittoe, a spokesman for House Speaker William G. Batchelder on a leave of absence to assist the GOP House campaigns, also said Dovilla’s campaign literature was not meant to convey the tax credit expansion attracted ""The Avengers.""

""You could word it this way and have the same meaning as the first: ‘The Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit has helped bring films like ‘The Avengers’ to Cleveland. Mike Dovilla’s big ideas, like expanding that tax credit, have helped make our state No. 1 in the Midwest for job creation,"" Dittoe said in an e-mail.

But that’s not what Dovilla’s campaign literature says. And in PolitiFact Ohio’s view, words matter.

The problem with Dovilla’s claim is that there are different ways that a reader could interpret it.

One could argue, as he does, that he was championing the success of the motion picture tax credit, and touting his role in pushing for its expansion. Or, one could look at his claim and infer a clear connection between expansion of the tax credit and filming ""The Avengers"" in Cleveland.

Dovilla said the ad isn’t meant to suggest his idea brought ""The Avengers"" to Cleveland, but a natural reading of his claim could suggest exactly that.

The ad is partially accurate – the Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit did help bring movie jobs to the state, and Dovilla did champion the movie tax credit expansion.  

But that it leaves out important details and takes things out of context.

""The Avengers"" movie came to Cleveland due to the original tax credit, which was established before Dovilla took office. And while Dovilla supported the expansion of the credit, it does not take effect until September.

Abortion rights group says Democratic congressional candidate Anthony Gemma has switched from “pro-life” to “pro-choice”
","
On July 19, the abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America announced that it was endorsing incumbent David Cicilline for reelection to Congress over his Democratic primary opponent, Anthony Gemma, who also ran for the seat in 2010.

The group cited Cicilline's consistent support for abortion rights, accusing Gemma of ""attempting a make-over"" on the issue of whether abortion should continue to be legal.

In a news release, NARAL President Nancy Keenan said the endorsement ""is a matter of consistency versus conflicting statements"" and that Gemma was calling himself a ""pro-life Democrat"" as recently as April 16, during a radio interview.

""In 2010, Mr. Gemma described himself as a 'pro-life' candidate,"" Keenan said. ""Now he claims to be pro-choice. My fear is that Mr. Gemma wants to hop on the pro-choice bandwagon as the anti-choice agenda unfolding in the House is becoming more and more unpopular.""

We thought readers might want to know whether Gemma really has done a major turnaround in two years. So we took a trip back in time (actually we checked our news archive), to when Gemma announced his original candidacy June 15, 2010.

""How would you describe a Democrat who supports gay marriage, a Democrat who is pro-life, except in cases of rape, incest and the health of the mother, a Democrat who opposes the death penalty, a Democrat who is pro-business when business is pro-Rhode Island, who is pro-labor when labor is pro-Rhode Island?"" he said during a speech at Providence Place mall.

He would repeat those views throughout the 2010 campaign.

Fast forward to April 16, 2012.

On WHJJ, Gemma told talk-radio host Helen Glover, ""I'm a pro-life Democrat.""

But he also made it clear that he objected to Republican efforts to put limits on what women could choose for birth control and said that his personal pro-life beliefs would not affect how he voted on the issue.

""I'm not in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade. I'm not even going near there,"" he said. ""My beliefs will not affect where everyone's going here. Women have their own right to choose.""

And in a July 5 news release with the headline ""Anthony Gemma Outlines Women’s Health Care Position/States He Will Defend a Woman’s Right to Choose,"" Gemma said the issue of family planning choices ""is something I personally wrestle with everyday.

""But I know I must put my personal religious beliefs aside, and defend a women's (sic) right to choose. The actions of Republicans in Congress and state legislatures are horrifying. I could never vote for an anti-choice bill. Women must be able to make this personal decision for themselves.""

The statement never used the word abortion but it seemed clear he was talking about abortion rights.

Spokesman Alex Morash acknowledged that Gemma's position had evolved because the candidate has become ""more understanding of other people's beliefs.""

When we inquired further for this story, Gemma e-mailed us a statement that said, in part: ""My commitments to defend a woman’s right to choose and to preserve and strengthen Roe v. Wade are born of deep contemplation. To an appreciable degree my change was spurred by Republicans’ ongoing efforts -- supported by the likes of Brendan Doherty [the Republican running for the seat] -- to return America to a dark age when women were second-class citizens whose most intimate health choices were made by men.""

Finally, we asked NARAL Pro-Choice America about the organization's assessment of whether Gemma belonged in the ""pro-choice"" category, given his pledge and his personal feelings. Part of their response: ""We remain skeptical of Anthony Gemma's sudden jump to support a woman's right to choose while labeling himself as a 'pro-life' candidate. His position contradicts how he frames his values.""

Our ruling

NARAL Pro-Choice America said: ""In 2010, [Anthony] Gemma described himself as a 'pro-life' candidate. Now he claims to be pro-choice.""

It's clear that Gemma's position on abortion rights has changed.

He went from saying that he supported a woman’s right to abortion only in cases of rape, incest and the health of the mother, to saying he would defend a woman's right to choose when it comes to health care and family planning options, although his statement doesn't specifically mention abortion.

He may be calling himself a ""pro-life Democrat"" in the same breath, but when the candidate says, ""I vow to protect a woman's right to choose,"" he's trying to put himself in the ""pro-choice"" camp.

NARAL says Gemma changed his position after his appearance on WHJJ. Clearly it predates that. But that's a side issue.

When NARAL says Gemma has gone from being a ""pro-life"" candidate to calling himself a ""pro-choice"" one, we judge that statement to be True.

David Dewhurst says he's seen Border Patrol signs in English, Spanish and Chinese
","Republican U.S. Senate hopeful David Dewhurst, saying the U.S.-Mexico border is dangerously porous, said in a July 17, 2012, debate in Dallas that he has even witnessed suspicious signs.

""I’ve seen the Border Patrol signs that are now in English, Spanish and Chinese,"" Dewhurst said in the debate with Ted Cruz, his opponent. Six days later, Dewhurst similarly referred to such signs in the pair’s last debate before the July 31, 2012, primary runoff.

Border signs in English and Spanish, sure. But Chinese?

Dewhurst’s camp did not respond to our inquiry about this.

But Daniel Milian, a Border Patrol supervisor in the agency’s Rio Grande Valley sector, told us such signs are posted next to ""rescue beacon"" towers arrayed in the rough brush country that covers much of the Texas-Mexico border region. In a telephone interview, Milian said the towers, 40- to 50-feet tall, are visible from great distances, the idea being that border crossers in danger of falling ill or dying spot them and come close. He said the signs instruct individuals to press a button to summon authorities.

And, Milian said, the signs are in English, Spanish and Mandarin, which is the group of dialects most widely spoken in China. The point, Milian said, is to deliver the message in ways that border crossers can understand. He said Mandarin was chosen because immigrants from China are second to immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries among border-crossers apprehended by the Border Patrol.

How exactly did this transpire? In a March 3, 2009, Border Patrol press release, the Rio Grande Valley sector said it was deploying two beacons in preparation for summer heat and to ""reduce the possibility of heat-related injuries and death."" The release says the beacons were ""designed for deployment to remote areas along the border and to provide people, who perceive themselves to be in a life-threatening situation, with a mechanism for summoning assistance.""

""The beacons will be embedded in established illegal alien and smuggling routes and are designed to provide a means by which persons in distress may locate, activate and summon emergency assistance,"" the 2009 release says.
 
The release quotes Ronald Citiello, chief patrol agent in Falfurrias, as saying: ""We work very hard to ensure that our borders are secure and safe, but many lives are still lost as a result of people not fully comprehending the inherent dangers of illegally crossing through the remote areas and not being aware of how quickly heat related distress can occur.

More recently, an April 27, 2012, Border Patrol press release stating that Border Patrol agents at the agency’s Falfurrias station, which is in Brooks County, saved the lives of two illegal immigrants that day after the pair activated a beacon. The release says the Border Patrol has six rescue beacons ""strategically placed on ranches throughout the area  Since Oct. 1, 2011, the release says, Border Patrol agents in the region had ""saved the lives of more than 120"" illegal immigrants, ""whose lives were in jeopardy due to a variety of circumstances.

Nationally, Border Patrol officers apprehended about 340,000 illegal residents through the latest federal fiscal year, from October 2010 through September 2011, the agency says, including nearly 126,000 along or near the Texas-Mexico border.

We failed to determine how many of the apprehended individuals were Chinese. But a July 2011 ""fact sheet"" from the Department of Homeland Security states that nationally, immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries comprised more than 95 percent of Border Patrol apprehensions over the five fiscal years through September 2010 with immigrants from China accounting for 0.3 percent or fewer of each year’s apprehensions. In the year running through September 2010, 1,157 apprehended individuals were of Chinese nationality.

Putting Mitt Romney's attacks on 'You didn't build that' to the Truth-O-Meter
","
For nearly two weeks, the Romney and Obama campaign have been arguing about whether President Barack Obama insulted entrepreneurs.

The argument started with comments Obama made about the intersection of business and government during a July 17, 2012 campaign appearance.

Romney, in comments at public events and in several ads, has argued that the remarks show a general disdain for business. The Republican National Committee and the National Federation of Independent Business are among the groups have released their own videos and statements echoing Romney that the president is out of touch.

In one fundraising e-mail, Matt Rhoades, Romney’s campaign manager, decried Obama’s ""naïve view that government, and not the hard work, talent, and initiative of people, is the center of society and the economy."" In another campaign e-mail, Amanda Henneberg, a Romney spokeswoman, said Obama had ""denigrated Americans who built their own businesses.""

The issue has become so big that the Obama campaign felt the need to address the issue head-on in a Web video titled ""Tampered"" that quoted media accounts saying the quote had been taken out of context.

Earlier, we looked at the full context of Obama’s statement. Here we will put a recent Romney claim about Obama’s comment to the Truth-O-Meter. To do this, we’ll look at the latest Romney web video in the seemingly endless back and forth.

Here's how the Romney campaign prefaced the video on its website:

""President Obama recently said: ‘If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.’

""Clearly, this President doesn't understand how our economy works.

""Mitt Romney understands that we have to celebrate people who start enterprises and employ other people rather than devalue them. Success is not the result of government, it is the result of hard-working people who take risks, create dreams, and build lives for themselves and for their families.

""Stand with Mitt today and stand up for Americans who work hard to build their businesses, their homes, their families and their communities.""

In this item, we’ll rate the claim that Obama was saying success ""is the result of government,"" not ""hard-working people,"" when he said, ""If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.""

In case you didn't catch it the first 5,000 times the snippet ran on cable, yes, those words were uttered by Obama.

But as you can see when you read the full text of his remarks, that quote distorts the meaning of Obama's claim. (Romney himself has been a victim of this kind of shenanigans, when opponents claimed he said he liked firing people.)

Here is the full context, from Obama's speech in Roanoke, Va.:

""There are a lot of wealthy, successful Americans who agree with me -- because they want to give something back. They know they didn’t -- look, if you’ve been successful, you didn’t get there on your own. You didn’t get there on your own. I’m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something -- there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.

""If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business -- you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn’t get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.

""The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together. There are some things, just like fighting fires, we don’t do on our own. I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service. That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires.

""So we say to ourselves, ever since the founding of this country, you know what, there are some things we do better together. That’s how we funded the G.I. Bill. That’s how we created the middle class. That’s how we built the Golden Gate Bridge or the Hoover Dam. That’s how we invented the Internet. That’s how we sent a man to the moon. We rise or fall together as one nation and as one people, and that’s the reason I’m running for President -- because I still believe in that idea. You’re not on your own, we’re in this together.""

We believe, as do our friends at FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker, that Romney has seriously distorted Obama’s comments.

Romney cherry-picked a quote that made it sound like Obama was dismissive of businesses when in fact he was making a point that success comes from the combination of ""individual initiative"" and the fact that ""we do things together.""

The biggest problem is that the Romney campaign has left out the lead-up to the statement -- that ""if you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges.""

These words indicate that Obama was referring to infrastructure and educational opportunities that were paid for by taxpayers through the government -- things that established a necessary foundation for making private businesses successful.

We think his meaning is clear -- that both business people and government play a role in the American enterprise system, not purely one or the other.

Our ruling

In speeches and videos, the Romney campaign has repeatedly distorted Obama's words. By plucking two sentences out of context, Romney twists the president's remarks and ignores their real meaning.

The preceding sentences make clear that Obama was talking about the importance of government-provided infrastructure and education to the success of private businesses.

Romney also conveniently ignores Obama's clear summary of his message, that ""the point is ... that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together.""

By leaving out the ""individual initiative"" reference, Romney and his supporters have misled viewers and given a false impression. For that, we rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2012/jul/26/mitt-romney/putting-mitt-romneys-attacks-you-didnt-build-truth/

Connie Mack says Bill Nelson missed 56 percent of his votes -- in 1990
","
U.S. Rep. Connie Mack, R-Fort Myers, says he’s hardly the only politician to miss a bunch of votes while running for office. In fact, Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson -- had a year about two decades ago when he missed more than any other member of Congress, says Mack.

Mack has taken a beating in the press for missing votes while running statewide including on hot topics such as repealing part of ""Obamacare"" and on Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget plan. Mack campaign manager Jeff Cohen fired back at Tampa Bay Times political editor Adam C. Smith in a July 24 letter:

""What you didn’t mention is that when Bill Nelson was in Congress and running statewide for governor in 1990, he had the absolute worst voting record of anyone in Congress. He missed a whopping 56 percent of his votes.""

We previously fact-checked a claim from Mack's Republican primary opponent, former U.S. Rep. Dave Weldon, that Mack missed ""almost half"" of his votes in Congress this year. We ruled that claim Mostly False because Mack didn't miss quite that many votes.

We’ll leave it to voters to decide the relevance of Nelson’s voting record from 22 years ago. Here, we wanted to see if the Mack campaign was accurate in its attack.

Missed votes by Mack and Nelson in 2012 and full career

Before we travel back in time to 1990, let’s look at more recent data: the number of missed votes this year so far. GovTrack.us shows quarterly missed votes for members using voting information from the official websites of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate -- and during a quarter the numbers can continuously change as more votes are taken. We will cite the numbers so far this year as of July 25 -- a day after the Mack campaign letter:

Nelson missed 1 vote out of 182, or less than 1 percent.

Mack missed 145 out of 502 votes, or about 29 percent.

GovTrack.us also shows historical data between January 2001 and late July 2012. That shows that Nelson missed 2 percent of recorded votes while Mack, starting when he joined the Senate in 2005, missed 6 percent.

 Nelson’s missed votes in 1990

In 1990, Nelson was in the U.S. House of Representatives and faced an uphill battle in a Democratic primary for governor against Lawton Chiles, who ultimately won.

We turned to Congressional Quarterly for our research on missed votes. CQ shows that in 1990 Nelson voted 44 percent of the time, which means he missed 56 percent of the votes. A CQ ranking showed that placed him dead last that year.

Nelson’s office sent us a 1990 Associated Press article in which Nelson explained that on important missed votes he went on record about how he would have voted.

Now let’s return to 2012.

We were unable to get an answer from Mack’s campaign or office if he issued statements explaining how he would have voted when he was absent. Campaign spokesman David James responded in an email: ""A missed vote for Connie is a missed vote -- according to you. Same standard for Nelson, irrelevant of statements.""

Nelson’s one missed vote this year was to confirm the nomination of a federal judge in Illinois, which passed 86-1 on May 14.

One final note about Nelson’s voting record: In addition to 1990, CQ shows that he only dipped below 88 percent voting participation one other year. In 1985 he voted 73 percent of the time -- the year he was training for a January 1986 shuttle flight.

Our ruling

Mack’s campaign manager said that in 1990, when Nelson was running for governor, he missed 56 percent of his votes -- the worst record in Congress. CQ data confirms that 22 years ago, Nelson missed 56 percent of his votes, placing him last in voter participation.

It is worth noting, however, that Nelson went on record with his position on some votes rather than simply skipping the vote.

Super PAC ad says Mitt Romney outsources jobs to India
","
A super PAC ad uses the splendor of the Olympics opening ceremonies as a backdrop to denounce Mitt Romney as an outsourcer and tax dodger.

The ad, by the pro-Barack Obama group Priorities Action USA, opens with an overhead shot of an Olympic stadium packed with people, cameras flashing. Romney, who led the 2002 Salt Lake City games, strides onto a stage and waves.

Olympic teams from China, India, Burma, Switzerland, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands parade in as an announcer makes multiple charges that Romney sent American jobs overseas and stashed his personal wealth in offshore accounts.

""Welcome to the Olympics,"" the voiceover says. ""There’s Mitt Romney, who ran the Salt Lake City games, waving to China, home to a billion people. Thousands owe their jobs to Mitt Romney’s companies.

""India, which also gained jobs thanks to Romney, an outsourcing pioneer. And Burma, where Romney had the uniforms made for the 2002 games.""

The announcer continues with claims about countries where Romney has had bank accounts or corporations.

The ad was apparently removed from YouTube because of copyright concerns, but we are checking its claims because they received so much coverage on cable news channels and the Web. Here we’ll look at the claim that India ""gained jobs thanks to Romney."" (We've previously examined the claim he was a ""pioneer"" of outsourcing.)

Outsourcing governor?

A spokesman for Priorities USA Action provided two different examples to back this up: a state contract that included use of a call center in India while Romney was governor of Massachusetts and a software company that also had a call center in India while it was owned by Romney's firm Bain Capital.

First, the call center from Romney's days as governor.

Last month, the Obama campaign released an an ad that said Romney, while governor of Massachusetts, ""outsourced call center jobs to India."" PolitiFact looked into that claim and found it wasn't so clear-cut. We rated it Half True.

When he was governor, Massachusetts had a $160,000 a month contract with Citigroup to process debit cards for food stamps, as well as offshore contracts through its child support enforcement and unemployment insurance programs in 2005. Citigroup outsourced its customer service call center to a facility in India.
   
So it’s an important point that the state wasn’t outsourcing work to India -- a state contractor was. But Romney chose not to to end the arrangement.

During budget negotiations in 2004, the second year of Romney’s term, the Democratic-controlled legislature sent Romney a budget with an amendment that ""would prohibit Massachusetts from contracting with companies that ‘outsource’ the state's work to other countries,"" according to the Boston Globe.
   
At the time, many states were contracting with companies that outsourced some form of their work overseas. The Government Accountability Office found that in 2005, 43 states had contracts with companies administering state programs in which some of the work, primarily customer service and software development, was done overseas. The revelation prompted 38 states to consider similar bans on contracting with companies that outsourced, the Globe wrote.

Romney was forced to weigh two competing interests: protecting and promoting jobs in his state vs. saving taxpayers money. The Globe pointed out that lawmakers in Kansas considered a similar measure but pulled the plug when they learned it would cost the state an additional $640,000. The prohibition in Massachusetts’ was favored by labor unions but opposed by some economists who said it didn’t make economic sense for taxpayers to pay more for low-skill jobs. Ultimately, Romney vetoed the measure because he said that even if those jobs were back in the United States, they would not necessarily have been in Massachusetts.

Outsourcing claims at Bain

Priorities USA Action also pointed us to Bain’s involvement with the technical support firm Stream International. Bain bought a stake in the software company CSI in 1993, and later merged it with another firm to form Stream International, according to the Washington Post. In the mid 1990s, Stream was setting up tech-support call centers outside the U.S.

There's no question that Stream had employees in India because it boasted in an October 2000 news release that it had a joint venture with the Indian company Tracmail to provide customer service at locations that included India.

However, Romney left Bain in 1999 to head the Salt Lake City Olympics, so he was gone from day-to-day operations by the time of this press release, though he remained CEO of Bain until 2002. But PolitiFact has rated claims of his continued involvement to be Half True because he founded the company and was responsible for its overall direction, and documents indicate he continued to be involved to some extent for the next couple of years.


 Our ruling

Priorities USA Action said that India ""gained jobs thanks to Romney.""

While Romney was governor, Massachusetts had contracts with companies that had customer service call centers in India. That’s not the same as the state directly sending work overseas, but Romney blocked a legislative effort to stop it. And it's reasonable to conclude that India gained some jobs, at least while the Massachusetts arrangement was in effect.

At Bain, he was part of a move to invest in CSI, which later merged with another firm to form Stream International, which announced the call centers in India a year after Romney departed to run the Olympics. So yes, India got some jobs from CSI, but Romney's influence was early and ultimately indirect.

As for being a pioneer, Romney and Bain joined the bandwagon, but they didn’t lead it. Outsourcing was an established practice by private equity firms to cut costs at companies they invested in.  They were more like disciples than pioneers.

On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/jul/26/priorities-usa-action/super-PAC-ad-mitt-romney-outsources-jobs-india/

Ted Cruz says David Dewhurst advocated guest worker program for all illegal immigrants
","In a televised debate July 23, 2012, the Texas GOP candidates for U.S. Senate sought to bolster their conservative credentials before the July 31 primary runoff election.

""Amnesty"" is a dirty word in this context, and Ted Cruz tacked his opponent’s name right onto it.

""The Dewhurst amnesty,"" Cruz claimed, ""would take every single illegal alien in the United States and give them a guest worker permit."" His source for that, he said, was a 2007 speech by Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst ""where he explicitly advocated a guest worker program for every single illegal alien in the United States today"" -- more than 11 million people, by the Pew Hispanic Center’s 2010 estimate, though of course not all would be adults qualified for a guest-worker program.

Is that what Dewhurst said?

Lauren Thurston, a spokeswoman in Dewhurst’s state office, emailed us a copy of the February 17, 2007, speech given when Dewhurst was named ""Mr. South Texas,"" an annual honor bestowed by a Laredo civic group.

The speech’s reference to guest workers is this:
  ""I support secure borders both north and south and I support a guest worker program for those here today illegally. Labor and skilled workers are critical to our Texas economy.""   Thurston didn’t address our request for more information about the program Dewhurst said he supported. Dewhurst campaign spokesman Matt Hirsch told us by email that Dewhurst was not referring to any specific program and has consistently opposed ""any amnesty."" 

Dewhurst faced questions about his 2007 speech in a July 24, 2012, interview by Andrea Watkins of Houston’s KRIV-TV, which aired the debate; his campaign posted video of the interview online.

Excerpts:
    Andrea Watkins: Did you support a guest worker program in that speech? David Dewhurst: In the speech, then and now is my same position. There’s no room for any discussion on doing anything until we secure the border. ...   Once the border is secure, would you still support a guest worker program, as you were saying in that speech? I would want to look at all of our options and see what is available. … What I was really focused on is that we need a sensible legal immigration policy. That’s what I’m after.   Mr. Cruz thinks, though, that a guest worker program that you were supporting is even more broad than the amnesty … the new policy that president Obama has adopted … President Obama would allow about eight hundred thousand people in the United States to stay, and your guest worker program would be for everyone who is in the United States illegally. First of all, it’s not my guest worker program. I wasn’t recommending any specific changes to our immigration policy, just that once we secure our borders -- and the federal government has not done a good job --  then Congress, I believe, needs to take up the issue and look at … how we try and identify those people that are here, that are national security risks to the United States. … Again, I’ve always been categorically opposed to amnesty, which is a pathway to citizenship for those who live here right now. 
PolitiFact researchers often explore different uses of the word ""amnesty"" in connection with illegal immigrants, recently reaching a definition similar to Dewhurst’s ""pathway to citizenship"" in a June 20, 2012, fact-check. Generally, amnesty consists of giving a group of lawbreakers a permanent guarantee that they won’t be punished for their offense. In immigration debates, we wrote, it is most accurate when applied to policies that give illegal immigrants a way to achieve permanent legal status.

So: A pathway, without punishment. Permanently.

We searched the Nexis newspaper archive for instances of Dewhurst otherwise declaring his views on guest worker programs and found one mention. An April 25, 2007, Houston Chronicle news story says Dewhurst told the paper in an interview that he ""has long urged Congress to enact a guest worker program for immigrants."" The story does not quote Dewhurst in any way about securing the border.

We did find, though, stories and opinion pieces mentioning prominent Texas Republicans’ support in 2006 and 2007 for immigration reforms urged by President George W. Bush that included a guest-worker program. Congress failed to reach agreement on such a plan in September 2006.

A McClatchy News Service news story June 2, 2007, said that different forms of the guest worker program had specified a maximum number of participants that ranged from 200,000 to 600,000 per year.

We also note that in May 2012, Dewhurst accused Cruz of supporting amnesty. Dewhurst got a Pants on Fire rating from us June 1, 2012, for his radio ad claiming his opponent helped steer two groups that led the national push for amnesty. Cruz was on the board of one group Dewhurst named -- the Hispanic Alliance for Prosperity Institute -- and that group wasn’t even close to leading the drive for comprehensive immigration reform (possibly to include a limited path to legal residency).

Our ruling

Dewhurst’s 2007 speech advocates a guest-worker program for ""those here today illegally,"" a view he seems to have aired again in an interview a couple months later and one that he also has not forsworn, far as we can tell.

So, it can fairly be said Dewhurst advocated a guest-worker program for illegal immigrants already here.

Would every single illegal immigrant be in the program, as Cruz says? As a practical matter, probably not, but Dewhurst’s speech laid out no limits.

His speech did, however, cite the need for border security, and of late, Dewhurst has said secure borders should be ensured before a guest-worker program is implemented. This significant clarification isn’t acknowledged in Cruz’s claim, which we rate Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/jul/26/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-david-dewhurst-advocated-guest-worke/

Claim on COVID-19 in UK ignores data showing death more likely for unvaccinated
","A long headline on a United Kingdom website painted an apocalyptic picture of the pandemic there, starting with this claim: ""The UK has Fallen — 81% of Covid-19 deaths are among the Vaccinated."" The article was from The Exposé, which says it was ""set up due to a lack of alternatives to the lying mainstream media.""  The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There are two things wrong.  The claim refers to the UK, which comprises England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. But it cites statistics only for Scotland. A full reading of the statistics shows that the unvaccinated in Scotland die at a rate much higher than the fully vaccinated. The article makes its claim by adding up figures in Table 18 from a Public Health Scotland report about COVID-19 deaths in Scotland from Aug. 21 to Sept. 17. Adding the columns of numbers in the table shows 302 deaths during the period and that 243, or nearly 81%, of the people were fully or partially vaccinated. The table itself tells a different story, however. It reports on the weekly death rates per 100,000 people during the period. For each of the four weeks, the death rate was lowest among people who had received two doses of the vaccine. In the final week of the period — Sept. 11-17 — the rate of death among the unvaccinated was calculated to be 8.38 per 100,000 people. That’s more than four times higher than the rate for the fully vaccinated (1.93) and higher than the rate for people who had received one dose of vaccine (4.93). Text below the table states: ""Age-standardized mortality rates for COVID-19 deaths shown in Table 18 are lower for people who have received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine compared to individuals that are unvaccinated or have received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. This is comparable with data published by the Office for National Statistics which showed the risk of death involving COVID-19 was consistently lower for people who had received two vaccinations compared to one or no vaccination, as shown by the weekly age standardized mortality rates for deaths involving COVID-19."" The claim also ignores two other important points about vaccinations in Scotland that help explain why the raw number of deaths is higher among the vaccinated: The vast majority of residents are vaccinated. Of Scotland’s population age 12 and over, 80.9% had received two vaccination doses as of Oct. 12, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Each of the other UK nations is within two percentage points of that rate. By comparison, 56% of the U.S. population was vaccinated as of Oct. 14, according to Our World in Data. Since Scotland rolled out vaccinations, 79.5% of the COVID-19 deaths are among people age 70 and over, according to the Scotland health report. A headline widely shared on Facebook claimed that in the United Kingdom, ""81% of COVID-19 deaths are among the vaccinated.""  The statistic alluded to by the claim applies to Scotland, not the entire United Kingdom, and it gives a misleading impression of what an official report says. The report says the rate of COVID-19 death in Scotland is much more likely among unvaccinated people.

Tenn. law bans teaching critical race theory in schools, not Black history
","With controversy around the country over critical race theory, a viral Facebook post made a stark claim about schools in Tennessee. ""Tennessee new law passed 48 hours ago now makes it illegal to teach Black history in the grades K-12."" The Oct. 13 Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A law Tennessee adopted in May puts restrictions on certain concepts related to Black history  By effectively banning the teaching of critical race theory, and allowing the state to withhold funding from public schools as punishment for violating the law. But schools are not prohibited from teaching the history of an ethnic group. Critical race theory is a collection of ideas about systemic bias and privilege. It holds that racism is part of a broader pattern in America: It is woven into laws, and it shows up in who gets a job interview, the sort of home loans people are offered, how they are treated by police, and other facets of daily life. Conservative elected officials in about two dozen states have moved to prohibit critical race theory from being taught in public schools or state agencies. Critics say it presents solely a negative picture of the United States and is designed to make students feel bad about their country. The ""48 hours ago"" part of the claim is wrong. The GOP-controlled General Assembly adjourned its 2021 session more than five months before the post, on May 5. That day, it approved the critical race theory bill. The bill was signed later that month by Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican. The term critical race theory does not appear in the law; rather the law says schools ""shall not include or promote"" 14 concepts ""as part of a course of instruction or in a curriculum or instructional program,"" or allow teachers or other employees ""to use supplemental instructional materials that include or promote"" the concepts, which include: ""An individual, by virtue of the individual's race or sex, is inherently privileged, racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or subconsciously."" ""An individual, by virtue of the individual's race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex."" ""An individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or another form of psychological distress solely because of the individual's race or sex."" ""A meritocracy is inherently racist or sexist, or designed by a particular race or sex to oppress members of another race or sex."" ""This state or the United States is fundamentally or irredeemably racist or sexist."" ""The rule of law does not exist, but instead is a series of power relationships and struggles among racial or other groups."" The law says schools are not prohibited from teaching the history of an ethnic group; ""the impartial discussion of controversial aspects of history; the impartial instruction on the historical oppression of a particular group of people based on race, ethnicity, class, nationality, religion, or geographic region."" David Barber, a history professor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, wrote that the Tennessee law’s ""real intent is not to prevent our public schools from ‘teaching’ the superiority of one race over another, since no one is doing that. No, the real object here is to prevent educators from discussing nearly four centuries of white domination over Black people.­­"" ""You cannot teach Black History — the history of this country from the perspective of Black people — without calling into question everything we know about ourselves and about our nation,"" Barber wrote. The law has caused some teachers to seek state approval of their lesson plans.  Beth Brown, president of the state teachers union, invited teachers to submit lesson plans to her, which she is sending without their names attached to the state education department to get pre-approval for anything potentially contentious, Reuters reported. She had received about 20 submissions, according to the Sept. 21 article. ""We are professionals with integrity, we are committed to doing our jobs well, to providing a well-rounded and high-quality education to our students. Sometimes that includes conversations about difficult topics that have occurred in history,"" Brown has said. ""This law is a slap in the face of Tennessee’s educators, it is a disservice to our students."" A Facebook post claimed that a Tennessee law ""passed 48 hours ago now makes it illegal to teach Black history in the grades K-12."" A Tennessee law adopted in May does not prohibit the teaching of Black history in public schools. The law does impose restrictions on teaching by banning critical race theory, which is a collection of ideas about systemic bias and privilege. The law prohibits the teaching of certain concepts, including that ""an individual, by virtue of the individual's race or sex, is inherently privileged, racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or subconsciously""; and that ""an individual, by virtue of the individual's race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex.""

Harvard study found that vaccinations alone aren’t enough to fight COVID-19
","The headline on a widely shared YouTube video suggested that a Harvard University study found that vaccinations aren’t effective in fighting COVID-19. ""Covid SURGES Among Most Vaxxed Communities Says Harvard Study,"" the headline said. The video was shared on Facebook and flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The author of the study said the headline misrepresents its conclusions. The study’s conclusion was not that vaccinations don’t impact infection, but that steps such as masking and social distancing should be used along with vaccination to fight the pandemic. The video was hosted by comedian and commentator Jimmy Dore, who cited a study published Sept. 30 in the peer-reviewed European Journal of Epidemiology. The study’s lead author, S.V. Subramanian, is a professor of population health and geography at Harvard. The introduction to the journal article noted a surge in cases in the United States and Israel. But the study itself analyzed the relationship between the percentage of population fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases reported over a seven-day period across 68 countries and across 2,947 counties in the United States. The periods varied slightly by area, but were in late August and early September. During that time frame, the study found, countries with a higher percentage of population fully vaccinated had a higher rate of new COVID-19 cases per 1 million people.  The findings were similar in the U.S. Of the five counties with the highest vaccination rates, three of them — Chattahoochee (Georgia), McKinley (New Mexico) and Arecibo (Puerto Rico) counties — had above 90% of their population fully vaccinated while also being identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as high-transmission counties. But the study’s message was not that vaccination doesn’t work. It was that other steps should also be employed to reduce case rates. ""The sole reliance on vaccination as a primary strategy to mitigate COVID-19 and its adverse consequences needs to be re-examined, especially considering the delta variant and the likelihood of future variants. Other pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions may need to be put in place alongside increasing vaccination rates,"" the study concluded. The study noted reports of declines in immunity from mRNA vaccines after six months. It also noted that vaccines offer strong protection against severe hospitalization and death. ""In summary, even as efforts should be made to encourage populations to get vaccinated, it should be done so with humility and respect. Stigmatizing populations can do more harm than good. Importantly, other non-pharmacological prevention efforts (e.g., the importance of basic public health hygiene with regards to maintaining safe distance or handwashing, promoting better frequent and cheaper forms of testing) needs to be renewed in order to strike the balance of learning to live with COVID-19 in the same manner we continue to live a 100 years later with various seasonal alterations of the 1918 Influenza virus."" Subramanian told PolitiFact: ""Concluding from this analysis that vaccines are useless is misleading and inaccurate. Rather, the analysis supports vaccination as an important strategy for reducing infection and transmission, along with handwashing, mask-wearing, proper ventilation and physical distancing."" We rated False a claim that it’s safer to be unvaccinated than vaccinated against COVID-19.  In September, the CDC analyzed vaccine effectiveness across 13 jurisdictions from April 4 to July 17 and matched that data to vaccine registries from those areas. It found that after delta became the most dominant variant, unvaccinated people were five times more likely to be infected than fully vaccinated people, and more than 10 times more likely to be hospitalized or die.  The headline on a YouTube video suggested that vaccinations don’t help fight COVID-19, claiming that the disease ""surges among most vaxxed communities,"" according to a Harvard study. The study did find high rates of infection in communities with high rates of vaccination. But the conclusion was not that vaccinations are ineffective. It was that prevention measures such as testing and distancing should be employed along with vaccinations to fight the epidemic. The statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context.

California’s trucking regulations may have had an impact on port backups, but there’s more to it
","As hordes of ships wait to unload at California ports and elsewhere, some are shifting  blame to the Golden State’s regulations on the trucking industry.  ""The NEWS says the California port situation is caused by a driver shortage,"" one viral post on Facebook said. ""Not so fast: It is in part caused by a California Truck Ban, which says all trucks must be 2011 or newer, and a law called AB 5, which prohibits Owner Operators."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post is referring to real California policies. But while experts say these rules have likely had some impact on supply chain disruptions, this post overstates their role. Many factors have contributed to the shipping backlog, including a lack of warehouse space and equipment shortages.  Most issues can be traced back to the COVID-19 pandemic, experts said, which resulted in factory closures and employee layoffs that crippled production worldwide. The delta variant of the virus that causes COVID-19 further shocked systems that were just starting to recover from the earliest phases of the pandemic.  The post points to two separate California policies: a law called AB 5 that was passed in 2019 and aims to give independent contractors more employee rights, and the state’s longstanding clean air regulations on heavy-duty vehicles. Commonly referred to as the ""gig worker bill,"" Assembly Bill 5 codified and expanded a 2018 California Supreme Court decision that set a strict new test for employers to determine whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor. It went into effect on Jan. 1, 2020. Under the measure, all workers are considered employees unless the hiring business demonstrates that the worker meets three conditions: They should be free to perform the work as they wish, or free from the control and direction of the hiring entity;  in a different line of work from the company contracting with them; and operating their own business. The law is intended to require employers to treat more workers as employees entitled to rights and benefits like a guaranteed minimum wage, employee benefits, expense reimbursements, rest or meal breaks and overtime pay. Critics, however, say the measure makes it nearly impossible for truck drivers to be independent contractors because they inevitably work in the same line as the companies they contract with. The Los Angeles Times reported in 2019 that out of approximately 13,000 truckers who serve the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, just a few hundred are classified as employees. Most are considered ""owner operators"" who often lease their rigs from trucking companies, drive under those companies’ permits and rely on them for work. They are paid by the load and get an annual 1099 tax form, which some freelancers and independent contractors use to report income. But it’s hard to quantify what role this law could be playing in California’s shipping backlog. That’s because the California Trucking Association quickly filed a federal lawsuit challenging the law, and the trucking industry remains under a temporary injunction exempting them from its confines. After a circuit court denied its appeal for a rehearing, the association petitioned the Supreme Court to hear its case. If the high court denies the petition, the injunction will be lifted immediately. At the time AB 5 passed, industry experts said that some owner-operators sought work elsewhere. Some fleets, too, chose to stop doing business with owner-operators in California.  Danielle Inman, a spokesperson for the National Retail Foundation, which has lobbied for California to overturn AB 5, told PolitiFact that the state’s regulations on trucking impact the availability of drivers and trucks, but many other issues are also disrupting the movement of goods through U.S. ports.  ""The overwhelming increase in volume, lack of available equipment such as chassis, empty container return policies, lack of available warehouse space are all contributing to the ongoing congestion issues at the ports,"" Inman wrote in an email. (Chassis are wheeled equipment that help move shipping containers.) The ""truck ban"" cited in the post refers to California's Truck and Bus Regulation, administered by the California Air Resources Board, which attempts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and diesel exhaust particulate matter. To meet the current clean air regulations, the state Department of Motor Vehicles blocks new registrations of any oversized vehicles older than 2011 — or those with engines manufactured before 2010. By 2023, nearly all trucks and buses will be required to have 2010 or newer engines. But this policy has been on the books since 2008. Some trucking companies have used the regulations to pressure drivers to buy newer rigs, and some in the industry have claimed that, while not necessarily the cause of the backlog, this kind of policy doesn't help. ""There is simply no evidence to support any claims that the current congestion at our ports has any connection to the state’s efforts to clean up California’s trucks,"" said Stanley Young, the communications director of the California Air Resources Board. ""Port congestion is currently a worldwide problem and there are many contributing factors."" ""96% of the trucks"" that serve the ports are already compliant with the state's Truck and Bus Regulation, he added. Experts say that while these regulations may provide some pressure, current port congestion and larger supply chain disruptions are the result of factors that are far more complex than this post suggests, with the issue extending much further than California and its laws.   The COVID-19 pandemic triggered factory shutdowns and worker layoffs early-on and exacerbated an already precarious system. ""We had a series of smoldering issues that had been around for a while, and then COVID was kind of the needle that broke the camel’s back,"" said Robert Handfield, a professor of operations and supply chain management at North Carolina State University. ""Unfortunately, it’s a bit of a mess, and it’s going to take some time to address.""  The global demand for goods bounced back fast as the COVID-19 vaccines became available and restrictions eased in various parts of the world. But that quick rebound left processing plants, manufacturers and businesses struggling to keep up, leading to global supply chain problems. Containers are limited, and semiconductors and critical raw materials like rubber, lumber and steel are running low.  The driver shortage has been an issue in the trucking industry for years, experts have said, and COVID-19 made it worse. The average age of the American truck driver is around 48, and officials say the problem will likely get worse in coming years as they begin to retire.  Focusing on new recruitments is one answer, and the American Trucking Associations is pushing for the DRIVE-Safe Act in Congress, which would allow 18-year-olds to obtain a commercial driver’s license. Currently, federal law dictates that drivers must be 21 and older. Countries have also fallen out of sync during the pandemic, the Wall Street Journal reported, with some nations still enduring lockdowns and other restrictions, and thereby constricting factories and making transportation and logistics more expensive. While the shipping pileups and the broader supply chain disruption show no signs of dissipating, the Biden administration has announced a series of measures to try to relieve the system, including that private companies like UPS and FedEx would expand their business hours and that the Port of Los Angeles would start operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Facebook posts claim that the shipping pileups at California ports are being driven, in part, by two policies affecting long-haul truck drivers in California. Truck drivers have been exempt from the gig worker bill since it was passed and the state’s clean air regulations have been in place since 2008. While the rules may have had some impact on trucking decisions in the state, the post overstates how much and omits the major role the pandemic has played. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread layoffs and factory closures that haven’t yet bounced back to meet the surging consumer demand.  For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

No evidence for internet rumor that sex traffickers are using abandoned car seats to lure victims
","Social media users continue to share posts claiming that sex traffickers are using abandoned car seats to lure in victims, even as local police and the organization behind the National Human Trafficking Hotline have said such claims are unfounded. Human trafficking is a legitimate threat that affects millions of people. But the photo of an empty child car seat sitting in a parking lot was not the tell-all that social media users were making it out to be.  The photo appears to have originated with an Oct. 9 Facebook post. The poster wrote that the car seat was in the parking lot of a Walmart in Wilkesboro, North Carolina.  ""Sex traffickers use this method to lure you in and snatch you up,"" the poster claimed.  An Oct. 9 Facebook post claimed sex traffickers were using an abandoned car seat to lure victims. The Facebook post was shared more than 700 times, and screenshots of it were flagged as part of the platform’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But the viral internet rumor exploded further online after a TikTok user warned about what she described as the latest ""trap"" from sex traffickers.  The video from Paige Marie Parker, who describes herself as a ""spiritual gardener"" and now has more than 178,000 followers, was reported by Rolling Stone after it got 12.2 million views in just over a day. It is no longer available on TikTok, but PolitiFact found a copy of it online. ""So have you ever seen this type of car seat just out of nowhere?"" Parker says in the video, as she points to a Facebook post from the Wilkesboro Police Department addressing the car seat photo and rumors. ""That’s not an ordinary car seat. That’s actually a trap."" ""That’s actually a sex trafficking car seat,"" Parker continues. ""No parent will ever leave a random car seat out there just to be out there. They want you to go up to the car seat and look around while they’ll really snatch you really quick. It’s a ploy. Please be safe out here ladies."" It’s important for people to stay aware of their surroundings. Should you want to report or seek services related to a case of human trafficking, you can contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or email [email protected]. But the Wilkesboro Police Department statement that Parker highlighted in her video did not confirm that traffickers are using car seats to draw in victims; instead, it debunked the rumor. The department wrote that it had investigated the car seat photo from the original Facebook post, and that the backstory had nothing to do with sex trafficking. ""At no time was this incident deemed to be involved in any criminal activity,"" the department concluded. The car seat was in the parking lot, the police said, because two Walmart customers purchased a new child car seat, then they removed their old one and left it there. Interim department chief Tommy Rhodes told the Associated Press that the police reviewed security footage of the events to determine what happened. ""If we for one second thought that was a sex trafficking ploy, we would be all over that,"" Rhodes said. Polaris, the organization that runs the National Human Trafficking Hotline, said in its own statement that ""when narratives like the car seat myth go viral, it can do serious harm to actual trafficking survivors,"" including by overwhelming anti-trafficking organization’s limited resources to respond to tips. ""Recent rumors about sex traffickers using abandoned child car seats to lure victims are unfounded,"" the Polaris statement said. A similar Facebook post claimed in September that ""empty baby car seats are being used as a lure to get you out of your car so you can be abducted or followed."" The post purported to show photos of a car seat left in a parking lot in Nashville. It was shared nearly 300,000 times. Other unsubstantiated internet rumors warning about human trafficking plots have taken off in the past. One rumor spread on Facebook in 2019 cautioned that sex traffickers were afixing zip ties to car door handles as a means of distracting victims. Another claim from 2019, amplified by the then-mayor of Baltimore, alleged that sex traffickers were driving white vans.    More recently, supporters of the QAnon movement advanced evidence-free conspiracy theories that separately accused Walmart and Wayfair, an online furniture retailer, of using certain items as cover for selling and shipping children to pedophiles. Facebook posts claimed that a photo shows a plot by sex traffickers to use abandoned child car seats to lure in victims. Police investigated the photo of an abandoned car seat that inspired this internet rumor. They concluded that it was not associated with sex trafficking or other criminal activity. Polaris, which runs the National Human Trafficking Hotline, called the rumor ""unfounded"" and a ""myth.""

In a caption, Cardone wrote: ""Apparently I have a new title; ‘domestic terrorist’ and I’ll accept it (if) that means I’m standing up for my Kids. Parents will no longer be able to exercise free speech, opinions or controls over what your kids are taught at school. I’ve been telling you for years, the school system was broken.""

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Facebook owns Instagram. Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Have parents who contest school curriculums been labeled ""domestic terrorists"" or barred from challenging school curriculums? No.  Garland’s Oct. 4 memo ordered the FBI to work with state and local officials to brainstorm ways to address ""threats against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff,"" and to establish procedures for threat ""reporting, assessment and response."" In a statement, the Justice Department clarified that the overall effort was ""designed to address the rise in criminal conduct directed toward school personnel.""  The word ""terrorist"" did not appear in either the memo or the Justice Department statement.  In addition, Garland clearly indicated that parents can challenge school curriculums or voice opinions that differ from that of their local school officials.  ""While spirited debate about policy matters is protected under our Constitution, that protection does not extend to threats of violence or efforts to intimidate individuals based on their views,"" reads the memo. Parents in some school districts have directed their hostility at school board members — most often due to the issue of masking in schools.   In August, a school board in Tennessee voted in favor of students wearing masks in class, which prompted a large group of parents to gather in protest. Some shouted things like ""we can find you, and we know who you are,"" as a board member walked to their car. In Virginia, the police ""have investigated threats to shoot Virginia Beach School Board members,"" the Virginian-Pilot reported. Masks were at the heart of that incident as well: The threats emerged after social media users discovered members of the board were not wearing masks — which were required in ""instructional settings"" at the time — at a gathering.      So the memo about school board meetings did not mention domestic terrorism. Where could that be coming from? The claims appear to be linked to a bulletin from the National Terrorism Advisory System, which warned of a ""current heightened threat environment"" in the U.S.  The bulletin from Aug. 13 mentioned several factors at work, including the 20th anniversary of 9/11 and threats from foreign and domestic terrorists. ""These actors are increasingly exploiting online forums to influence and spread violent extremist narratives and promote violent activity,"" reads the bulletin. ""Such threats are also exacerbated by impacts of the ongoing global pandemic, including grievances over public health safety measures and perceived government restrictions.""  Although the bulletin made reference to ongoing frustration some have expressed about pandemic safety restrictions, experts say it did not designate anyone a domestic terrorist. The U.S. departments of State and Treasury have the authority to designate groups as terrorists; the National Terrorism Advisory System does not. An Instagram post claimed that ""parents who challenge school curriculums"" were labeled ""domestic terrorists."" The FBI was ordered to work to address criminal threats against school officials and staff. Garland’s memo underscored that ""spirited debate"" is protected by the Constitution.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In the clip, CNN’s Brianna Keilar asked Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases: ""Have you taken a test? Are you going to take a test?""

Keilar then said, ""But it’s hard to fully do it."" ""I know, but not everybody in the United States should take a test,"" Fauci said. ""I mean, I have no symptoms."" The post cut off Fauci and flipped to a clip of comedian Kevin Hart. Fauci did say he wasn’t going to take a COVID-19 test — at the start of the pandemic. The clip was taken from a March 15, 2020, interview on CNN’s ""State of the Union."" At the time, there was limited availability of COVID-19 tests. This was two days after most schools and workplaces closed due to the pandemic for the first time. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance from March 10, 2020, said clinicians should prioritize three groups for COVID-19 testing: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 symptoms; Others with symptoms, especially older adults and people with underlying conditions; Symptomatic people in close contact with someone who had or was suspected to have COVID-19 as well as symptomatic people who travelled from affected areas. Because Fauci didn’t have COVID-19 symptoms, he would not have been prioritized for a test under CDC guidance. The post also cut off Fauci’s explanation of when he would take a COVID-19 test. In the full video of the interview, he said: ""I have no symptoms. There's no reason for me to take a test. If I’m in a situation where I’m at a higher risk, I will take a test."" COVID-19 tests are more widely available now, and CDC guidance has changed. As of Oct. 15, the CDC recommends tests for: People with COVID-19 symptoms; People who had close contact with someone with COVID-19; Unvaccinated people who were in situations, like big parties, that put them at a higher risk for contracting the coronavirus; People asked to get tested by their healthcare provider or health department. This wasn’t the first time the video clip had been shared in a misleading way long after Fauci’s interview. The Associated Press reported on it in March 2021. The Instagram video was watermarked with ""The News Junkie’s Cartoons,"" a group that describes itself on YouTube as ""the most ridiculous and embarrassing moments in the news about Democrats and more."" An Instagram post claims that Fauci said he wasn’t going to take a COVID-19 test. The video takes Fauci’s words out of context to make it look like he distrusts PCR testing for COVID-19. Fauci’s comment came at the start of the pandemic, when testing supplies were tight, and certain groups were prioritized for testing. Fauci didn’t have COVID-19 symptoms, so he wouldn’t have been prioritized for testing. In the full clip, on CNN, Fauci explained that he would get a COVID-19 test if he were in a situation that put him at a higher risk of contracting the coronavirus.

WHO database is not proof that COVID-19 vaccines are harmful
","While more than 6 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccines have been administered to people across the globe, social media users continue to cite the number of reported adverse reactions to the vaccines to cast doubt on their safety.   A video shared on Instagram claims millions of injuries connected to the COVID-19 vaccines have been reported to the World Health Organization. The video is a screen recording from someone’s phone as they visit the WHO’s VigiAccess website, and search for information on the COVID-19 vaccine. The video highlights the 1.9 million records received by the health organization, and lists heart failure, hypertension and death as among the reactions people have reportedly suffered. ""Over 2 MILLION ‘C-nineteen’ injuries reported to the WHO,"" a caption with the video read. ""Get pissed."" The Instagram video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram is owned by Facebook. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video implies that vaccines are harmful to people and could cause serious injury or death. However, the numbers highlighted in the video are taken out of context. VigiAccess is a website from the WHO that allows the public to access the organization's database on the reported potential side effects of drugs and immunizations. The reports come from some of the 149 countries that participate in the organization's Programme for International Drug Monitoring, including the United States, Brazil and Vietnam. The source of the reports come from countries’ health agencies as well as from individuals who provide their own information on side effects they or someone they know have experienced. Before a person can use VigiAccess, they receive a caution message detailing several things to consider while looking at the site. The message stresses that the list of reported side effects does not confirm they are caused by a particular drug or immunization. ""Information in VigiAccess on potential side effects should not be interpreted as meaning that the medicinal product or its active substance either caused the observed effect or is unsafe to use,"" the website says. ""Confirming a causal link is a complex process that requires a thorough scientific assessment and detailed evaluation of all available data."" Anti-vaccination groups and COVID-19 skeptics typically use the data from databases like the WHO's as proof that the vaccines are harmful to people, according to the New York Times. In many cases the unconfirmed reports are misinterpreted by the groups as fact. PolitiFact has checked similar claims that used the United States’ Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System and the European Union’s EudraVigilance database as evidence of the COVID-19 vaccines danger. The reported side effects featured in the European and American databases are similar to the WHO's, which have also not been independently confirmed by scientists. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has deemed the three COVID-19 vaccines that are administered in the United States to be safe and effective. However, the CDC has said there have been rare cases where people have developed an allergic reaction or thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome following their vaccination. The allergic reaction has occurred in roughly two to five people per million who are vaccinated, while there have only been 47 confirmed cases of people developing thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. There has not been a confirmed case where the COVID-19 has caused a person's death.  An Instagram post claims that more than 2 million injuries related to the COVID-19 vaccines have been reported to the WHO. The post takes reports to the health organization out of context.

No living organisms in the Pfizer vaccine
","A 17-minute video posted to Facebook shows a Swedish doctor claiming that the Pfizer vaccine contains particles that could germinate and cause illness in those who get vaccinated. The doctor is Erik Enby, whose medical license was revoked in 2007 after two cancer patients in his care died following his prescriptions of fungicides, herbs and vitamins, according to Swedish news reports.  In the Facebook video, which has since been removed from the platform but exists on other platforms like Reddit, Enby displayed images on his computer that he claimed showed a microscopic view of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The particles moving on the screen, he said, were living microorganisms. ""I believe it has to do with development of illness. I think (the particles) can germinate in the body and if they do, there will be further growth development and all sorts of uncontrollable byproducts,"" Enby said.  Enby also claimed that a vaccinated person could stop the living particles from germinating by taking vitamins and supplements. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Health experts say there’s no truth to it. PolitiFact debunked a similarly false claim that the Pfizer vaccine contained a parasite.  The ingredients for Pfizer vaccines are chemical components — not living organisms, said Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""There is no evidence that there are living particles in doses of the Pfizer vaccine. There is no accuracy to this claim,"" Adalja said. Pfizer spokesperson Kit Longley wouldn’t comment on the video, but told PolitiFact that the vaccine’s messenger RNA technology helps the body recognize the COVID-19 virus’ spike proteins and produce antibodies to fight off infection.  ""The messenger RNA is injected into the body and enters cells, where it provides instructions to produce antigens, the substance that causes your immune system to produce antibodies,"" Longley said. ""The cell then presents the antigens to the immune system, prompting responses that can fight the disease. This process presents the body with the instructions to build immunity."" RELATED VIDEO  Volker Mai, associate professor in the department of epidemiology at the University of Florida, said he hasn’t come across peer-reviewed evidence of contamination in the Pfizer vaccines.  ""Contamination with spores or other microbial material can theoretically happen during production of any biologic, including vaccines,"" Mai said. ""However, quality control is extensive and monitoring occurs continuously. Thus, it is highly unlikely that any contaminated batch would make it into the market."" PolitiFact reached out to Enby for evidence to support his claim, but didn’t hear back.  Enby claimed in a Facebook video that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine contained living particles that could germinate and cause illness in vaccinated people. Health experts say this is false.

Media reported for weeks on drop in Florida COVID-19 cases, which followed surge
","Conservative podcast host Joey Saladino took a shot at the media while touting a decrease in COVID-19 infections in Florida.  ""The Media is pretty quiet about Florida's Decline in COVID cases. No Mask Mandates or Vaccine Mandates,"" Saladino wrote on Instagram, where he has 148,000 followers. The Oct. 10 post included a chart, with data attributed to the New York Times, indicating that the rate of daily cases of COVID-19 in Florida had dropped sharply starting in late-August 2021. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The news media have reported for weeks on the drop in cases — which occurred only after a period in which Florida led the nation in new cases. Moreover, while it does have measures restricting mask and proof of vaccination mandates, it still ranks among the states with the highest case rates. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has signed COVID-19 measures to prohibit requirements to prove vaccination in certain places and to ban mask mandates in schools. In May, DeSantis signed a bill that prohibits requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination to gain entrance to, or services from businesses, governmental bodies and educational institutions. Violators are subject to a $5,000 fine per violation. On Oct. 12, the state fined Leon County, home to the capital, $3.5 million for requiring its employees to get COVID-19 vaccines and for firing 14 workers who failed to get the shots. In July, DeSantis issued an executive order to ban mask mandates in schools. So far, it has prevailed in court challenges. The order states that schools cannot mandate that their students wear masks and that the state can deny funding to districts that don’t comply. On Oct. 7, the state Board of Education voted to sanction eight school districts, exposing them to potential funding cuts, because the districts allow parents to decide whether the students wear masks. COVID-19 cases in Florida are decreasing — but from staggering heights. In late July, we rated Pants on Fire a claim that reports of Florida’s cases being up were ""a blatant lie."" Florida accounted for more than one-fifth of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. at the time and recorded more COVID-19 deaths than any other state. The seven day-average positivity rate for testing rose from 0.83% on June 11 to 24.3% on July 25. In each of the past six weeks, counts of new cases have declined sharply, according to the latest figures from the Florida Health Department.  There were 151,789 new cases during the week starting Aug. 20 and 25,792 during the week starting Oct. 1. But Florida still ranks high in the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 1 million population, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. As of Oct. 14, North Dakota was first, at 183,176; Florida was fifth, at 167,728; the U.S. average was 135,767.

No, wildfires weren’t bigger in the 1920s and ‘30s than today
","The wildfire season in the U.S. has gotten longer. In recent decades, what once lasted four months has grown to six or even eight months. Climate change makes summers warmer, but past forest management has also left forests with more fuel to ignite. An article from the conservative Heartland Institute argues that the role of climate change is ""grossly overemphasized.""  ""U.S. acres burned each year are much fewer now — even in our worst years — than was the case in the early 20th century,"" the Oct. 11 article said. The author points to U.S. government data that shows a dramatic drop in the number of acres burned, from over 40 million in 1930 down to 10 million around 2015. The problem is, federal officials have known for some time that their data was unreliable, and this year, they took most of it off their website (which drew accusations of cherry picking the numbers from the Heartland Institute). Many factors made the data shaky. Perhaps the most intriguing part of this story of bad data is that the government’s old information includes millions of acres in the 1920s and 1930s that burned not by accident, but by intent. On top of that, there was also double counting, and, as some see it, undercounting. The Heartland Institute pointed to this chart to back up their claim about wildfire trends. The data came from the National Interagency Fire Center.  A fact-sheet from the conservative Heartland Institute used this chart based on federal data. If you go to the federal center’s wildfire page today, you will find this message: ""Prior to 1983, the federal wildland fire agencies did not track official wildfire data using current reporting processes. As a result, there is no official data prior to 1983 posted on this site."" A 2015 article from a Forest Service researcher explained why that data was unreliable. She wrote that multiple federal, state and local agencies filled out fire reports each in their own way, using different approaches to report different kinds of information. The article talked about records ""compromised by inherent reporting biases, inconsistencies and errors or uncertainty in the data."" There were instances when fires were counted twice, or more, said John Abatzoglou, a fire researcher at the University of California Merced. ""Some fires can be counted in triplicate as multiple agencies responding to the fire would count that fire in their summary statistics,"" Abatzoglou said. The Heartland article author, senior fellow H. Sterling Burnett, minimized that concern. ""It’s not that there isn’t any overcounting,"" Burnett said. ""But people managing federal agencies were smart enough to notice when two organizations reported the same fire."" As a record of the total number of acres burned over many years, historian Stephen Pyne, Arizona State University professor emeritus, said he thinks the government probably underestimated the damage. ""Most of the country outside federal lands was not counted at all,"" Pyne said.  The most certain conclusion about the government numbers behind the chart is that they can’t be trusted. But many experts who have dug into the archives talk about a major flaw that greatly inflated the federal statistics. They describe how conflict between the U.S. Forest Service and southern landowners likely threw off the totals by millions of acres. In a 2018 article, Randal O’Toole, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, included that same chart showing the dramatic fall in wildfires based on federal data. O’Toole is skeptical of broad claims of climate change. But O’Toole offered this chart with a stinging caption. ""Some people use the data behind this chart to argue against anthropogenic climate change. The problem is that the data before about 1955 are a lie."" O’Toole noted that at the turn of the 20th century, Congress told the Forest Service to suppress fires. This mandate put the federal agency in direct conflict with landowners in the southeast. The Forest Service was steadfast in its opposition to all fires. But the southeaster landowners burned their forests every four or five years to control underbrush. ""Perhaps 20% of forests would be burned each year, compared with less than 1% of forests burned through actual wildfires,"" O’Toole wrote. ""The Forest Service responded by counting all fires in that state, prescribed or wild, as wildfires."" There is broad agreement on this problem. ""The early U.S. Forest Service wildfire activity summaries do include millions of hectares of intentional burning on ‘unprotected’ lands, which, until approximately the mid-20th century was viewed by the U.S. Forest Service as akin to wildfire, as something that should be prevented and ultimately eradicated,"" the Forest Service researcher wrote in that 2015 article. That wasn’t exactly news. Researchers for an outside report commissioned by the Forest Service wrote in 2003 that ""in excess of 10 million acres were burned by wildfires annually"" between 1930 and 1950.  ""Most of the area burned during this period was in the Southeastern United States and were primarily incendiary fires,"" the authors wrote. (Incendiary fires are intentional fires.) We raised these issues of the unreliability of the federal database with Heartland’s Burnett. He said many articles in peer-reviewed journals had also relied on it. ""You can only go with the data you have,"" Burnett said. He said even if the numbers are flawed, the number of acres lost to wildfires today is still less than it was in 1930. That’s unlikely. No expert we reached knew of any national study that could fix the errors in the government’s original data. But there has been a lot of work done on the western states where the largest fires take place. Jeremy Littell with the Department of Interior Alaska Climate Science Center, along with several colleagues, examined fire reports for 11 western states — Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.  They used a blend of federal, state and regional reports, and they filtered out intentional fires, only counting burns on federal or federally-protected land. They looked at the years 1916 to 2020 The peak of 7.4 million acres burned came in 2012. But the next highest, 6.7 million, came in 1919. Among the top 20 highest years, a bit more than half, 13, took place after 1987. The rest came before 1932. The fact is, there were some huge fires at the turn of the century. ""The large fire years in the West between about 1916 and the late 1930s were comparable to those in recent years,"" Littell said. Littell said the triggers for large fires are the same today as they were in the first decades of the 1900s. Hot and dry summers in a preceding year lead to worse fire seasons. And since 1980, those conditions have become more common. The Heartland Institute said, ""U.S. acres burned each year are much fewer now  — even in our worst years —  than was the case in the early 20th century."" The claim was based on federal data. However, over the years, researchers concluded that the federal data was deeply flawed. While there might have been some undercounting, double and triple counting also took place. Most damaging of all, in the 1920s and 1930s, millions of acres of intentional fires in the southeast were counted as wildfires. One climate change skeptic called the government data ""a lie."" This year, the government withdrew its original dataset, and now only provides counts starting in 1983. There is no national level analysis going back to the turn of the last century, but an analysis of 11 western states suggests that the toll of fires today is at least on par with the fires in the first few decades.

IRS reform proposal would not require banks to hand over info on routine transactions
","Is the Biden Administration trying to gain more information about taxpayers’ bank and credit union accounts, even if the transactions are routine? U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Janesville, says the answer is an unequivocal yes. ""I oppose Biden’s IRS data collection scheme, "" Steil said in a Sept. 24, 2021 tweet. ""It would require banks and credit unions to hand over private information about routine transactions to the IRS. This is a total invasion of Americans’ privacy."" Is Steil right, that President Joe Biden's IRS reform proposals ""require banks and credit unions to hand over private information about routine transactions to the IRS?"" When asked for backup, Steil’s office pointed to a plan that would increase IRS reporting requirements for banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions regarding transactions by  customers.  The proposal was included in a spending bill that was sent to the House Ways and Means Committee, specifically Division I, Sec. 138402 of the measure.  The measure, as introduced, which would require financial institutions to report gross inflows and outflows from business and personal accounts if the inflows and outflows total at least $600 in a year, or if the account has a fair market value of at least $600.  Currently, IRS form Form 8300 is filed by individuals and entities who, ""in the course of that trade or business, receive more than $10,000 in cash in one transaction or in two or more related transactions,"" Chye-Ching Huang, executive director of the Tax Law Center at NYU Law, said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. Huang said Steil’s statement is ""inaccurate and misleading."" ""Secretary (Janet) Yellen and other administration officials have stated publicly that there would be ‘nothing at the transaction level’ in this provision,"" Huang said in an email. ""Instead, the proposal calls for an annual snapshot of two numbers for covered accounts: 1) The total amount that flowed into an account over a year, and 2) the total amount that flowed out.  Huang offered an example of a person who receives $2 million of cash every month in their account. ""All the bank would report to the IRS is that the account had total inflows of $24 million during the year,"" Huang noted.  ""No new transaction-level detail would be required. So, for example, the IRS would not know who paid in the $24 million each year, or in how many installments, or when, because the bank would not report that information. Similarly no detail on any payments made from the account would be reported, only the total amount.""    RELATED: PolitiFact: ""Biden plan to require more bank account reporting to IRS is still a proposal""  RELATED: Will the IRS track 'every' Venmo transaction? Fact-checking claims on new financial reporting plans The aim of the measure is to allow the IRS to more effectively assure compliance with tax laws. That, in turn was expected to generate an additional $460 billion in income-tax payments over 10 years, the Treasury Department says.  Here is how Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen described it in a Sept. 14, 2021 letter to Richard E. Neal, chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means: ""These information reporting provisions will make use of information financial institutions already know to help shed light on taxpayers who evade their tax obligations. Today, compliance rates are under 50 percent for opaque sources of income-resulting in a disproportionate tax burden for complying taxpayers and a shortage of necessary funds for key national priorities."" In other words, because some people are not reporting all of their income, others wind up picking up more of the load and there’s not enough money for key priorities. According to Yellen, for some categories of income, the IRS can easily cross check what taxpayers report on their tax returns with other sources. For instance, wage and salary income is reported by employers on W-2 forms, and taxes are automatically withheld, so compliance rates stand at 99 percent.  ""It is clear that when taxpayers know that this information exchange exists, their voluntary compliance rises,"" Yellen wrote. ""But for certain income streams that accrue disproportionately to upper-income households, there is no information available to the IRS from third parties presently. As a result, underpayment is rampant.""  In an Oct. 4, 2021 statement emailed to PolitiFact Wisconsin, the Treasury Department gave this example:  ""Imagine a taxpayer who reports $10,000 of income; but has $1 million of flows in and out of their bank account. Having this summary information will help flag for the IRS when high-income people under-report their income (and under-pay their tax obligations). This will help the IRS target its enforcement activities on those who are actually evading their tax obligations — decreasing costly and burdensome audits for the vast majority of taxpayers who pay what they owe."" In any case, according to a Sept. 23, 2021 article from Bloomberg News, Biden’s fellow Democrats have said they will scale back the proposal, presumably by making the reporting threshold significantly higher. That brings us back to Steil’s claim. The proposal would put the reporting burden on the institution, so that’s one reason the banking industry opposes the change. And it would lower the current approach dramatically, from individual large transactions to overall money flowing in and out. By definition, the IRS wants to get more information on more accounts. But Steil’s phrasing of ""routine transactions"" is off the mark, in that it suggests every check -- whether for the cable bill or for nephew Billy’s birthday -- would, in many cases, have to be reported. The requirement is only for summary information. Steil said Biden's IRS reform proposals ""would require banks and credit unions to hand over private information about routine transactions to the IRS."" An initial proposal does include a $600 threshold, and shifted the burden to banks. That was dropped by Democrats amid outcry from banks -- something not acknowledged in Steil’s tweet. Likewise, the claim suggests every transaction will be reported, when the proposal calls for a higher-level summary. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression our rating is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/oct/15/bryan-steil/irs-reform-proposal-would-not-require-banks-hand-o/

The conservative Gateway Pundit website made the claim with this headline: ""EXPLOSIVE VIDEO Emerges of Fauci and HHS Officials Plotting for ‘A New Avian Flu Virus’ to Enforce Universal Flu Vaccination."" The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim is a gross misrepresentation of what the officials were talking about. Similar claims were made by the conservative One America News network in reporting on the video, and by social media users who shared clips of the video on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Gateway Pundit’s article cited an Oct. 4 ""emergency broadcast"" by Alex Jones’ InfoWars, a website known to air false news and conspiracy theories, which in turn cited the video. The hourlong C-SPAN video, entitled ""Universal Flu Vaccine,"" is from an Oct. 29, 2019, panel discussion that included Fauci, a top HHS official who is also President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser; and Dr. Rick Bright, an immunologist and vaccine researcher who was then a top HHS official.  Among the topics they discussed was the quest for a ""universal flu vaccine."" The phrase ""enforcing universal flu vaccination"" in the Gateway Pundit headline gives the false impression that the goal of pursuing a universal flu vaccine is forced vaccination of all Americans. But that’s not what ""universal"" means in this case. As the panelists explained, ongoing research toward a universal flu vaccine is aimed at creating a vaccine with long-lasting protection against multiple flu strains that would eliminate the need for annual flu shots. As the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the federal agency Fauci heads, puts it: ""A key focus of NIAID’s influenza research program is developing a universal flu vaccine, or a vaccine that provides robust, long-lasting protection against multiple subtypes of flu, rather than a select few. Such a vaccine would eliminate the need to update and administer the seasonal flu vaccine each year and could provide protection against newly emerging flu strains, potentially including those that could cause a flu pandemic."" Fauci said during the session that viruses are ""a continual moving target, from season to season,"" unlike polio, smallpox and measles viruses. He described a prospective universal flu vaccine as ""a vaccine that induces a response in the body to that part of the influenza that doesn't change from season to season, from decade to decade or even that much when you get a pandemic."" RELATED VIDEO   The panel discussion was not a plot for a new flu virus that could pave the way for forced vaccinations. The headline also misrepresents the officials’ references to avian flu, a disease that infects birds but can pose a risk to humans. Avian flu was mentioned once, in the context of possible future advances in how vaccines are developed and delivered.  ""It is not too crazy to think that an outbreak of a novel avian virus could occur in China somewhere, we could get the RNA sequence from that, beam it to a number of regional centers,"" Bright said, adding: ""The technology is there to be adapted and assembled to put into that futuristic view of a rapid response to an emerging novel threat."" A headline widely shared on social media claimed that Fauci and U.S. health officials plotted ""for a new avian flu virus to enforce universal flu vaccination."" The claim broadly misrepresents what they were talking about. The video shows they didn’t discuss any such plot.  Fauci’s reference to a universal vaccine meant one that could provide long-lasting protection from multiple flu strains and eliminate the need for annual flu shots.

No jail time for rapists? Walton hasn’t said that
","India Walton is campaigning for Buffalo mayor on a different approach to criminal justice than her opponent, four-term incumbent Byron Brown.    Brown has seized on these differences.  ""My opponent’s plan for people who commit sexual assault, sexual predators, is no jail time,"" Brown told a crowd at a fundraiser, according to a video posted by Investigative Post on Sept. 26. ""No jail time for rapists, sexual predators, domestic abusers, she wants restorative justice for those kinds of individuals.""  Brown’s campaign has previously made this claim, and we wanted to know if this is, indeed, what Walton wants.  We approached the Brown campaign for evidence, and it sent a video clip of Walton at a news conference, filmed Aug. 16, discussing her public safety plans.  She mentions ""restorative justice,"" which, broadly, is an approach to public safety where people who are harmed have their needs met, and those who are responsible must make things right. If they consent, people who are harmed are involved in the resolution, and people who cause harm can atone for their acts. In general, restorative justice de-emphasizes incarceration, though some models work within the existing criminal system. Walton stressed in an in an August interview that restorative justice can be an option only if the person who has been harmed wants to pursue this approach.  In the clip the Brown campaign sent, Walton says: ""To protect potential future survivors, we will provide individuals who have committed harm pathways to accountability, amends, growth and healing, through community-based restorative justice programs."" It’s similar to the plan she published in an essay in the Buffalo News.  In neither case did she explicitly say no jail time for rapists.  In an interview with WGRZ-TV, posted on July 1, she said that when she speaks with groups who favor abolishing police and prisons, she tells them the structure to replace policing does not exist yet.  ""It’s not for me, necessarily about getting rid of police altogether,"" Walton said. ""And when I speak to members of the activist community who are abolitionists, I say we haven't created the structure to replace policing yet. It would be great if we could move away from punitive measures. There are certain countries where they have been successful at doing that. We’re not ready, right? And that’s why we have to reimagine community safety as a whole.""    We also looked at Walton’s public safety platform, where she says that in cases of sexual and intimate partner violence, investments should be made in community-based programs that provide safety and independent living for survivors, and support services in the community for offenders.  ""In order to move those who have harmed others along a path to accountability, amends, growth, and healing, and protect potential future survivors, we must invest in non-carceral community-based support services and restorative justice programs.""  Walton told the Intercept in the spring that she envisions a world without police. ""I am an abolitionist,"" she said. ""But I am also realistic enough to know that it can’t happen in one fell swoop. Because we have not built the infrastructure to maintain safety in our communities."" She said she is more pragmatic than some other activists. ""Governance means that sometimes you don’t always get to do what you believe,"" she said.   We read and listened to Walton's media interviews, and couldn't find instances where Walton said she doesn't want jail time for rapists. But Walton also hasn't talked up locking up violent sexual offenders. Much of her campaign messaging is about using different approaches to public safety, about using police to solve crime, and leaving other activities, such as getting residents to cut their tall grass or enforce traffic laws, to civilians.  We asked her campaign what she means by ""non-carceral community-based support services,"" and whether her definition of restorative justice means people wouldn't go to prison.  Jesse Myerson, Walton’s director of communications, said that the candidate has never proposed ending jail time for rapists, and said that mayors do not make sentencing laws.  As a survivor of sexual assault, Walton wishes she had had a chance to confront her assailant, and have a conversation where each was supported by their community, to facilitate healing and growth, but that does not mean that criminal legal proceedings are discarded, Myerson said.  ""Without community-supported restorative justice processes of the sort she hopes to cultivate in office, the only option is handing the situation over to the police -- an option which all but makes accountability impossible, since those who've committed harm are basically forced to deny culpability, rather than atone and make amends, or else face time in prison, where sexual violence is notoriously rampant,"" Myerson said. ""These processes would happen parallel to the criminal legal system, which would of course continue to investigate, prosecute, and sentence those convicted of crimes."" Walton wants poor and working class communities to have the resources to handle their own problems without resorting to police, Myerson said. But ""this does not imply releasing convicted sex offenders or instructing police not to enforce laws against sexual violence.""  In restorative justice approaches, survivors have more influence in what happens after a crime, and they may want incarceration for their attacker, or they may not, Myerson said.  Brown said that Walton wants ""no jail time"" for sexual offenders.  Walton has talked about wanting to move away from punitive measures, and favors a restorative justice approach, where survivors have input into whether their assailants are locked up or make amends in the community. Walton’s preference for focusing on survivors and their needs does not mean she is proposing all sexual offenders stay out of jail.  We rate his claim False.  ",/factchecks/2021/oct/14/byron-brown/no-jail-time-rapists-walton-hasnt-said/
