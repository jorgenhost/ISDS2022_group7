Barack Obama claims credit for ""at least 16 tax cuts to small businesses.”
","
During a July 6, 2011, question-and-answer session on Twitter, President Barack Obama was asked -- in a tweet by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio -- ""After embarking on a record spending binge that left us deeper in debt, where are the jobs?""

Part of Obama’s answer is that his administration has worked to aid small businesses in job creation.

""We have provided at least 16 tax cuts to small businesses who have needed a lot of help and have been struggling -- including, for example, saying zero capital gains taxes on startups -- because our attitude is we want to encourage new companies, young entrepreneurs, to get out there, start their business, without feeling like if they’re successful in the first couple of years that somehow they have to pay taxes, as opposed to putting that money back into their business.""

This response echoed a comment we checked a few weeks earlier. In a face-off between the heads of the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee on NBC's Meet the Press on June 11, 2011, the discussion turned to what the government should be doing to accelerate job creation.
   
""I think we need to cut taxes on small businesses,"" said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.
   
""Well, that's good,"" retorted DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., ""because we've done that, 17 times.""
   
Here’s what we found when we looked at the question of small business tax cuts.

When asked for supporting documents, the DNC press office pointed us to a Feb. 25, 2011, posting on the official White House blog titled ""Seventeen Small Business Tax Cuts and Counting."" The post enumerated 17 small business tax cuts and credits created or extended through legislation signed by Obama.
   
Eight of them were included in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (more commonly known as the economic stimulus bill), the Affordable Care Act (also known as the health care law), and the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (aka the HIRE Act). Among the cuts were the exclusion of up to 75 percent of capital gains on key small business investments; a tax credit for the cost of health insurance for small business employees and new tax credits for hiring Americans out of work for at least two months.
   
Another eight cuts came via the Small Business Jobs Act, signed by Obama in September of 2010. These included: adding deductions for business cell phone use; creating a new deduction for health care costs for the self-employed; allowing greater deductions for business start-up expenses; eliminating taxes on all capital gains from key small business investments, and raising the small business expense limit to $500,000.

Three months later, the president signed a tax bill that raised the expense limit to 100 percent of small business new investments until the end of 2011. It also extended the elimination of capital gains taxes for small business investments through the end of 2012.
   
Here's the full list:
   
From the Recovery Act, HIRE Acts, and Affordable Care Act:
   
1. A new small business health care tax credit
   
2. A new tax credit for hiring unemployed workers
   
3. Bonus depreciation tax incentives to support new investment
   
4. 75 percent exclusion of small business capital gains
   
5. Expansion of limits on small business expensing
   
6. Five-year carryback of net operating losses
   
7. Reduction of the built-in gains holding period for small businesses from 10 to 7 years to allow small business greater flexibility in their investments   

8. Temporary small business estimated tax payment relief to allow small businesses to keep needed cash on hand
   
From the Small Business Jobs Act:
   
9. Zero capital gains taxes on key investments in small businesses
   
10. Raising the small business expensing to $500,000
   
11. An extension of 50 percent bonus depreciation
   
12. A new deduction for health care expenses for the self-employed
   
13. Tax relief and simplification for cell phone deductions
   
14. An increase in the deduction for entrepreneurs’ start-up expenses
   
15. A five-year carryback of general business credits
   
16. Limitations on penalties for errors in tax reporting that disproportionately affect small business
   
From the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act:
   
17. 100 percent expensing
   
Conservative tax specialists don't quibble much with the list, but they did take issue with the context earlier this year when we asked them about the same claim by Wasserman Schultz. ""I can't argue with any of these, but it ignores all the proposed and enacted tax hikes on small businesses,"" said Ryan Ellis, director of tax policy at Americans For Tax Reform, an anti-tax group headed by Grover Norquist.
   
For example, Ellis said, it ignores President Obama's proposal to allow Bush-era individual income tax cuts to expire for those making more than $250,000. ""A clear majority of small business profits are earned in households making at least $250,000 per year."" Ellis said. ""...That's a tax hike on the small business sector."" (PolitiFact Virginia addressed a similar claim in this fact-check.)

There are also a number of tax increases included in the health care law, Ellis said, some of which apply directly to small businesses. For one, he said, businesses with more than 50 employees could face a tax penalty if they don't provide enough health insurance to their employees. Another example, the 10 percent tanning tax, which he said is ""nearly exclusively applied to small businesses.""
   
""So the overall story is much more of a problem for small firms than the Obama administration would suggest,"" Ellis said.
   
Curtis Dubay, senior tax policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, allowed that ""there have been targeted tax cuts for small businesses."" But, he said, ""it's an error to just point to the number of tax cuts. You have to look at the overall impact and that certainly has been steep tax hikes.""
   
Dubay also noted that six of the 17 cuts were not just for small businesses but were made widely available to all businesses.
   
Richard Morrison at the Tax Foundation, a pro-business group, said that ""nothing on (the White House list) stands out as egregiously unjustified from a fact-checking perspective. Some of them are temporary, and some aren’t targeted exclusively at small businesses, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they shouldn’t 'count' ""as far as the claim is concerned.""
   
We think there's room for critics to note that in addition to the 17 tax cuts enumerated by the White House, there are there are also some tax increases in the health care law that will fall on some of the same small business owners that got tax cuts. Some health care law tax increases won't go into effect for a couple years. And with some, like the excise taxes on tanning beds, one could argue it is a tax on the customer, not the small business.

As for allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire at the end of 2012, that's still just an Obama proposal; it hasn't happened. The only policy actually signed by the president so far was a compromise agreement that extended the tax cuts. On balance, we rated Wasserman Schultz's comment Mostly True. Because Obama’s comment is substantially similar, we also rate his comment Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-claims-credit-least-16-tax-cuts-small/

Bill Kristol says 40 percent of union members voted for John McCain in 2008
","
On the July 3, 2011, edition of Fox News Sunday, panelists discussed the connections between labor unions and the Democratic Party.

During the exchange, Bill Kristol, the editor of the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard, said that despite longstanding ties between unions and Democrats, support for Republicans among voters who are union members is higher than one might think.

The discussion began with a clip of Vice President Joe Biden appearing before a union audience in Las Vegas, joking about the bond between unions and Democrats.

A moment later, Kristol said, ""Joe Biden spoke more truth than he realized when he made this joke that, well, you guys, it's out of the question that you union members could vote Republican. A lot of union members vote Republican. I think a third -- what is it, 40 percent, even of union members voted Republican even in 2008?

""And, in fact,"" he continued, "" ... it's a real question how much the union leadership speaks for the members. And I do think it's very important for the Republican candidate in 2012 to be able to win over what we used to call Reagan Democrats, many of whom are (or) who have been union members.""

To check Kristol, we decided to look at exit poll data -- the surveys taken every two years of voters leaving polling places. These surveys, which are designed to capture a snapshot of the electorate on Election Day, classify voters by a range of demographic questions, some of which involve union membership.

We looked at the exit poll numbers for 2008 and found that 39 percent of voters from union households voted for Republican presidential nominee John McCain, compared to 59 percent for Democrat Barack Obama.

So Kristol’s memory was essentially correct. Still, we’ll provide a couple minor caveats.

First, there are slight differences between how voters from union households voted (that is, the numbers we cited above) and how union members themselves voted (which is specifically how Kristol phrased his comment). Union members voted 60 percent for Obama and 37 percent for McCain -- two points less for McCain than voters who lived in union households. (Voters from union households accounted for 21 percent of the electorate in 2008, while union members accounted for 12 percent.)

Second, judging by the context, we think Kristol meant voting patterns in the 2008 presidential race, but it’s worth noting that the same exit polls painted a different picture of union voter behavior in House elections.

In 2008, voters from union households split their vote for House candidates this way: 34 percent for Republican candidates and 64 percent for Democratic candidates. The numbers were similar for actual union members -- 34 percent backed Republican candidates and 65 percent backed Democratic candidates.

We also wondered about the long-term trendline, since Kristol’s implication was that Republicans did pretty well in 2008 in securing union votes. So we looked at past levels of union support for GOP candidates.

For presidential elections, we compared the GOP candidate’s vote share from union members to the GOP candidate’s vote share from all voters. (In every case, the Republican did better among all voters than among union voters.)

We found that McCain did better than almost all of his Republican predecessors in winning votes from union households. McCain won 46 percent of the vote nationally, so his union backing was only 7 points behind his overall support.

Since 1952, only one other Republican candidate did as well among union voters -- Ronald Reagan in 1980, who also had a gap of just 7 points between overall support and union support. But Reagan wasn’t able to repeat his magic in 1984 -- his union vote trailed his national vote by 13 points. And that pattern continued until McCain in 2008, with the gap bouncing between 11 and 13 points from 1984 to 2004.

So there’s some support for the notion that Republicans are doing pretty well among union voters these days.

Kristol’s recollection on Fox News Sunday was very close to reality. We’re only lowering him a notch due to a lack of clarity about whether he meant union members as opposed to union households, and about which 2008 election he meant -- presidential or House. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/07/bill-kristol/bill-kristol-says-40-percent-republicans-voted-joh/

On repeal of Wisconsin's smoking ban, Walker goes from pro to con
","
It’s been a year since you could light up a smoke in Wisconsin bars and restaurants.

The state’s smoking ban, approved by the Legislature and Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle in 2009, took effect in July 2010 and continues to stir debates.

Some tavern and restaurant owners say it’s hurt their business and driven away long-time patrons -- or sent them outside to shiver. Others say state government shouldn’t be mandating what businesses can and can not do.

Meanwhile, smoking ban supporters are pleased they can have a beer or a meal and not go home smelling like an ashtray.

On June 30, 2011, as the ban’s first anniversary approached, Gov. Scott Walker issued a statement that said he would not support a repeal of the ban. That sounded like a new stance from the conservative Republican governor.

So, we decided to roll out the Flip-O-Meter, which measures how consistent politicians have been on key issues. Remember: It does not examine whether a change in position is a good one from a political or a policy perspective.  

Indeed, on contentious issues, some will view a switch as sensible flexibility in response to constituent demands. Others will see it as political appeasement or caving to pressure. As they say, where you stand depends on where you sit.

In this case, perhaps, especially if you sit at the bar.

Here is the sum total of Walker’s statement:

""Although I did not support the original smoking ban, after listening to people across the state, it is clear to me that it works. Therefore I will not support a repeal.""

What did Walker say about the smoking ban in the past?

While a candidate for governor, Walker was opposed to the ban, and then his position shifted -- to being even more strongly opposed to it. The shift came in response to positions staked out by Mark Neumann, his opponent in the Republican primary election.

Here’s how that played out:

Walker said on July 6, 2010, that he would didn’t believe that government should have been involved. ""On principle I don’t think the government or anybody else should be telling these establishments or anybody else what they should or shouldn’t do,"" he said.

A few days later, Neumann said he supported repealing the ban: ""The smoking ban to me is a local issue and it’s about personal responsibility and personal freedoms and local control.""

The following day, on July 10, 2010, Walker matched Neumann’s call for a repeal of the ban: ""I don't think the government should have been involved in a smoking ban in the first place, and as governor, I would sign a repeal of this law.""

The smoking ban did not become a key issue during the primary campaign or the general election. And Walker did not made any additional statements about the ban until the one where he said he would not back its repeal.

Studies by groups such as the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center said that air quality in state bars and restaurants had improved 92 percent since the ban took effect. And SmokeFree Wisconsin, a group that supported the ban, said 75 percent of state residents support the ban.

So, Walker started out opposed to the ban, even toughening his stance to promise a repeal. But now he’s opposed to a repeal, so the ban will remain. For those scoring at home, that comes in as a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2011/jul/07/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-repeal-wisconsins-smoking-ban/

Ohio ranks 50th in income growth, foodbank leader says
","
Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, executive director of the Ohio Association of Second Harvest Foodbanks in Columbus, told a hearing of a U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee in June that participation in her agency's programs is at a record high.

The need for food assistance has increased dramatically since 2008 because of the recession, she said, but it was growing already over the past decade as the number of Ohioans in poverty jumped almost 50 percent.

She told the hearing -- which was called over a report by the Government Accountability Office on potential duplication of federal programs -- that economic recovery should make little difference, because her agency has not seen a correlation between the state of the national economy and people receiving food aid in Ohio.

""No, unfortunately, we haven't,"" she said.

Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee, interrupted in surprise: ""But when the economy improves which we all hope it does sooner rather than later, you don't anticipate any less participants in your program?""

""I don't,"" Hamler-Fugitt said. ""And if you just look at the data, Ohio currently ranks 50th out of all states in income growth.""

PolitiFact Ohio knew times were tough, but we did not expect to find Ohio running dead last.

Hamler-Fugitt cited an analysis based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis that looked at income growth over the past 50 years. Specifically, the analysis looked at data on disposable income, which is defined as all money earned by all residents of a state in a given year, minus all income taxes and property taxes.

Over the last 50 years, the nation’s disposable income grew at an annual rate of 7.1 percent.  Nevada’s income growth rate, 10.1 percent, was easily the nation's highest. Arizona was the only other state above 9 percent. Florida, Texas and Colorado rounded out the top five.

Industrial states in the Northeast and Midwest fared the worst, according to the analysis, posted online by The Business Journals. Ohio’s 5.9 percent per year rate of growth was the slowest. Michigan and New York were only slightly better.

Ohio actually ranked 51st in the analysis, which also included the District of Columbia.

That snapshot looked at Ohio’s performance over 50 years. The state didn’t fare much better in other time frames.

Related figures from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, for example, show Ohio’s growth in personal income in 2010 was below the national average of 3.0 percent. It’s 2.7 percent rate ranked 34th in the nation.

Nevada's growth in personal income in 2010, incidentally, was actually last in the nation at 0.3 percent.  

The most recent available figures from the U.S. Census Bureau also put Ohio in the bottom half of states in personal income per person (33rd) and in median household income (31st).

What does it add up to?

An analysis of data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis supports Hamler-Fugitt’s statement on income growth. That analysis covers a 50-year period. And while Ohio didn’t rank last using other gauges, the state does land in the bottom half. Those pieces of information provide clarification and context.

Gov. Chris Christie credits former Gov. Jim McGreevey for a decrease in New Jersey auto insurance rates
","
Gov. Chris Christie recently credited one of his Democratic predecessors for saving New Jersey drivers some money.

Christie, a Republican, said former Gov. Jim McGreevey helped reduce auto insurance rates in a state where drivers struggled for decades with high costs and few insurance options.

""I’ve got to give a shoutout to Governor McGreevey,"" Christie said in an ""On the Line"" interview with Steve Adubato. ""He did a very good job on that while he was governor and our auto insurance, while still high, is not anywhere near as high as it used to be about a decade ago. And that's because we went to market-based solutions that brought more folks in here, created more competition, and now you have lower rates.""

Any New Jerseyan with four wheels and a driver’s license knows insuring those four wheels can get expensive. But are drivers in the state better off because of changes enacted by McGreevey?  

First, let’s tackle how auto insurance rates have fared over time.

According to data compiled by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents insurance regulators, the average combined premium in New Jersey dropped from $1,316.49 in 1998 to $1,197.91 in 2008, the most recent year analyzed by the association.

The state’s average combined premium, which is the average price for a policy that includes liability, collision and comprehensive coverage, peaked in 2004 at $1,386.46.

PolitiFact New Jersey also looked at the average expenditure, a statistic that aims to measure what motorists spent on average for car insurance, including those who buy only liability coverage.

The average expenditure in New Jersey dropped  to $1,081.28 in 2008 from $1,138.28 in 1998. It peaked at $1,221.08 in 2004, according to NAIC numbers.

The NAIC notes that these measurements are calculated with no distinction for deductibles, vehicle types and other factors that can affect auto insurance rates, and does not rank states because of these issues. However, the rankings can be compiled from data in the reports.

According to our analysis, New Jersey had the most expensive combined average premiums in the nation, including Washington, D.C., from 1998 to 2004. In 2005 and 2006, D.C. pulled ahead and New Jersey dropped to second. But for the two most recent years of data, 2007 and 2008, New Jersey has ranked third, behind D.C. and Louisiana. The state’s rankings for average expenditure have a similar trend.

Is McGreevey the reason for the drop?

In 2003, McGreevey enacted changes to the state’s auto insurance regulations in a bid to attract more insurance companies to the state, increase competition and lower rates. The same year, California-based Mercury General, opened in New Jersey and other major insurance companies followed.

Although New Jersey’s average combined premium and average expenditure on auto insurance peaked in 2004, they have fallen annually since then, according to NAIC data.

But rates have also decreased nationally since 2004.

A national expert on auto insurance told us that while the movement in rates in New Jersey mirrors national trends ""to some extent,"" costs are being pushed down by state reform efforts from McGreevey in 2003, and from reforms enacted in the late 1990s.

""It’s become a much more attractive place for companies,"" said David Snyder, American Insurance Association vice president and associate general counsel.

Three other industry experts said the reforms enacted during McGreevey’s tenure deserve significant -- if not complete -- credit for cheaper auto insurance in New Jersey.

John Dyke, a trustee of the trade group New Jersey Auto Agents Alliance, said ""the reforms actually do help a lot because they drive competition within the market place.""

The economy also is a factor, Dyke said, because more people are opting for less coverage.

Chuck Leitgeb, vice president of the Insurance Council of New Jersey, an organization that represents insurance companies in New Jersey, largely attributed the drop in prices to the reforms.

The drop in the average expenditure is ""unquestionably the results of the reforms,"" said Brian Sullivan, editor of Risk Information, which covers the insurance industry. ""They’ve unleashed a competitive frenzy in New Jersey.""

Let’s recap.

Christie said market-based reforms enacted during McGreevey’s tenure helped drive down auto insurance costs in New Jersey, and experts we spoke with said reforms enacted in 2003 played a significant -- if not complete -- role in reducing rates.

We rate Christie’s statement True.

HUD secretary Shaun Donovan says housing prices ""stabilized"" since Barack Obama entered office
","
The July 3, 2011, edition of CNN’s State of the Union with Candy Crowley featured an interview with Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan. Crowley quickly turned to the troubles in the housing market.

She said, ""By the numbers, when you came into office with the president, when he nominated you, 844,000 homes roughly were in foreclosure. 1.3 million right now are in foreclosure, and it's down a bit. Only 36 percent of people at this point, according to polls, approve of the way this administration has handled the housing crisis. Is there something more you can do?""

Donovan responded, ""Well first of all, Candy, we have to recognize, this is the most serious crisis we've had in housing since the Depression. Housing prices have been dropping for 30 straight months when the president walked into the Oval Office, and they have stabilized, they've been about flat since the president came in.""

He added, ""So we've made a real difference. … But, rightly, the American people recognize we are not where we need to be. We still have a ways to go.""

We were most interested in Donovan’s recap of housing price trends, so we checked to see whether housing prices did indeed drop ""for 30 straight months when the president walked into the Oval Office, and they have stabilized, they've been about flat since the president came in.""

We’ll start by saying that there’s no shortage of housing-price measurements. We found at least five that are conducted either monthly or quarterly, and because of varying methodologies, they all give slightly different snapshots of the housing-price market.

Here’s a rundown:

• S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index. This seasonally adjusted index looks at 20 major metropolitan areas, so it provides a limited -- though important -- assessment of the housing-price market.

Between July 2006 and January 2009, there were some modest (and temporary) upticks, but on the whole, the index fell by a significant amount -- a whopping 28 percent in the 30-month period, or nearly 1 percentage point per month on average.

During the Obama presidency, the index has continued to drop, though at a slower rate. Between January 2009 and April 2011, the index has fallen by about 4 percent, with drops in exactly half the months and increases in exactly half the months.

The most recent trendline, however, is negative: Prices have fallen for 11 straight months since June 2010.

• National Association of Realtors. This index, published by the trade association representing Realtors, tracks median prices for existing home sales on a national basis. The numbers are not seasonally adjusted, so month-to-month comparisons are subject to caution.

As with the Case-Shiller index, there were some modest upticks for the 30 months prior to the Obama presidency, but the general trendline was downward. The index dropped by 29 percent over the 30 months before Obama took office.

Since Obama has been in the Oval Office, prices have risen slightly -- 2.5 percent over the subsequent 28 months.

But as with Case-Shiller, the numbers most recently have been heading south: The index has fallen for six consecutive months.

• Federal Housing Finance Agency. This federal agency calculates its own price indexes, including a quarterly index that’s seasonally adjusted. It’s based on transactions backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, federally chartered companies that purchase mortgages on the secondary market. That means this index measures a subgroup of all transactions, but a significant one.

This index fell 11 percent between the third quarter of 2006 and the fourth quarter of 2008. Since the fourth quarter of 2008, the index has fallen an additional 8 percent, including declines in every single quarter of the Obama presidency.

• Freddie Mac House Price Index. Freddie Mac produces its own index as well. The Freddie Mac index blipped upward occasionally between July 2006 and January 2009, but overall, this index fell by a combined 20 percent before Obama entered the White House.

Then, between Obama’s January 2009 inauguration and March 2011, the index fell an additional 9 percent. The index has fallen for each of the most recent 11 months.

• CoreLogic Home Price Index. This index showed a 27 percent decline in the 30 months before Obama entered the Oval Office and a 6 percent decline since he took office. The index fell for nine straight months before recovering slightly in April and May of 2011.

Using these measures, then, Donovan overstated the case when he said that housing prices dropped ""for 30 straight months when the president walked into the Oval Office."" That’s not literally true by any of these indexes, though his underlying point -- that it was a rough 30 months for the housing market -- is confirmed by each of the indexes.

In addition, Donovan’s implication that the president deserves a significant amount of credit also holds some water, with the National Association of Realtors estimating that a homebuyers’ tax credit backed by Obama encouraged an additional 1 million home sales.

Less convincing is Donovan’s description of what has happened since Obama has entered office. If one uses a generous definition of ""stabilized"" -- performing better than previously -- then Donovan has a point. Since the start of 2009, housing prices have indeed avoided their historic declines of 2006, 2007 and 2008,

However, a more stringent definition of ""stabilized"" -- and a greater focus on Donovan’s wording ""flat"" -- would suggest a different conclusion. If you look at the five indexes, the overall change in housing prices since Obama took office are a 2.5 percent increase, a decline of 4 percent, a decline of 6 percent, a decline of 8 percent and a decline of 9 percent. And in four of those indexes, prices have been declining for between six to 11 months with no sign of a reversal.

When we contacted HUD with our findings, officials offered some explanations for the differences.

One difference is that HUD used three specific measures, rather than the five we looked at -- and two of those were variations on the ones we had looked at.

When using the Case-Shiller index, HUD used the non-seasonally adjusted version, even though that would not be considered the most appropriate way to make month-to-month comparisons. We checked their numbers, and, using this number, HUD is right that home prices declined for more than 30 consecutive months prior to Obama taking office. Using the seasonally adjusted numbers, as we did, it’s not the case.

When using the CoreLogic data, HUD relied on a separate measure of house prices that excludes distressed sales -- that is, it excluded urgent sales of houses due to negative conditions, such as a foreclosure.

How to count distressed sales is an important question when evaluating housing prices in the current market. As distressed homes work their way through the market, they will continue to be a drag on prices, which in turn will make it harder for the market to -- in Donovan’s word -- ""stabilize."" The National Association of Realtors expects distressed-home sales to exert negative pressure on the housing market for months to come.

We won’t judge whether HUD is justified in excluding distressed sales, but we do think it’s important to note that it does and, in doing so, reduces the impact of one factor holding back a rise in home prices.

The second difference between our research and HUD’s is that HUD started the clock in April 2009 -- not January 2009 -- under the argument that Obama could not have had an impact on the housing market until a few months into his presidency. This may sound like a small difference, but moving the starting date even three months actually changes the result significantly.

Using the three statistics HUD tracked, a switch from starting in January to starting April means that the decline in prices under CoreLogic decreases from 3.5 percent to 0.8 percent; the decline under Case-Shiller decreases from 5.1 percent to 0.3 percent; and the decline under FHFA decreases from 8.3 percent to 7.1 percent.

It’s certainly easier to call the CoreLogic and Case-Shiller numbers that start in April ""stabilized"" or ""flat"" than the ones starting in January. Then again, Donovan was pretty clear in his comment that he was starting the clock ""when the president walked into the Oval Office,"" which would mean January.

So where does this leave us?  

Donovan is right that things aren’t as bad as they were during the worst of the housing downturn, but we think he’s overstating the case when he says that housing prices are ""stabilized"" and ""flat."" The statistics HUD offered support that conclusion, but those numbers require starting the clock in April 2009 (which conflicts with Donovan’s statement); using a factor that helps the administration’s case (namely, excluding distressed sales); and using a non-seasonally-adjusted figure when a seasonally adjusted figure is available.

The reality is that there are a wide range of statistics one could use to analyze housing prices, each with advantages and shortcomings. Most of the statistics we looked at show that housing prices have continued to decline -- though at a slower rate -- since Obama took office, and the decline is especially clear over the last six months to a year. That is at odds with Donovan’s conclusion that they had stabilized and were ""flat."" On balance, we rate Donovan’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/06/shaun-donovan/hud-secretary-shaun-donovan-says-house-prices-stab/

""The reality is these high-skilled immigrants are job-makers, not job-takers,"" Case said. ""...We really need to make sure that we get the best and brightest, not just in our schools here and give them Ph.D.s, but when they graduate, we get them to stay here and start companies here, not start companies other places.

CNN host Candy Crowley said that's a tough sell in the current environment because with unemployment so high, many people are asking why we are letting in more immigrants. 

Case responded that ""statistics show they (immigrants) are job creators, that 40 percent of the Fortune 500 were started either by immigrants or children of immigrants. So they are creating great companies. And we want them to create those companies here. If we send them off to other countries, they will create the companies there, and that's where we're going to see the jobs and the economic growth. So that's a key part of it, making sure that you really are a magnet.""

Case is a co-chair of the Democracy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit that seeks to develop bipartisan consensus on government policy. And he was tapped by President Barack Obama to serve as chair of the Startup America Partnership and serves on the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness.

We decided to check his claim that ""40 percent of the Fortune 500 were started either by immigrants or children of immigrants.""

The statistic comes from a report prepared by the Partnership for a New American Economy, a bipartisan group of mayors and business leaders that seeks an overhaul of national immigration policy. Released in June 2011, the report, ""The 'New American' Fortune 500,"" is an analysis of the origin of the founders of the top 500 revenue-producing companies published by Fortune Magazine.

According to the report:

""More than 40 percent of the 2010 Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children. Even though immigrants have made up only 10.5 percent of the American population on average since 1850, there are 90 immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies, accounting for 18 percent of the list. When you include the additional 114 companies founded by the children of immigrants, the share of the Fortune 500 list grows to over 40 percent.""

Those companies employ more than 10 million people worldwide and generate revenues of over $4.2 trillion, the report states.

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, one of the co-chairs of the Partnership, has repeatedly cited the findings in speeches calling for immigration reform.

""The American dream cannot survive if we keep telling the dreamers to go elsewhere,"" Bloomberg told the Council on Foreign Relations on June 15, 2011. ""It's what I call national suicide, and that's not hyperbole.""

We spoke to Jeremy Robbins, policy adviser and special counsel to Mayor Bloomberg and one of the creators of the report, about its methodology.

""We tried to be as conservative as possible,"" Robbins said.

They contacted or read the company literature to determine the founders of the Fortune 500 companies. In the case where there were multiple founders, and some were not immigrants, or the children of immigrants, they were not deemed to have been founded by immigrants for the statistic. In the case of utilities, which were the result of several local utilities merging, they erred on the side of not counting them, he said. And when there wasn't a clear founder -- such as companies created by government charter, they were counted as not immigrant-founded.

""We let the companies draw the line (about who was the founder) with their own narratives,"" Robbins said. ""The reality is, it's hard to make a decision about how to do this in a fair way.""

It can be tricky business. Take the case of Alexander Graham Bell, born in Scotland, who is credited in the report with founding AT&T. Bell is also listed in the report as the founder of Verizon (which emerged from the breakup of AT&T, one of the seven ""Baby Bells""), because the report's authors couldn't identify anyone else as a founder.

Verizon was counted as immigrant-founded, Robbins said, ""on the theory it cuts both ways.""  Robbins said they stayed consistent with that line of reasoning even when it went the other way.

General Electric is another example of the ambiguity involved in determining the role of immigrants. The company is listed as founded by the child of an immigrant, Thomas Edison. Born in Ohio, Edison was the son of Samuel Edison of Canada, who emigrated to the U.S. after he took part in the failed Mackenzie Rebellion of 1837. But Edison was also the son of Nancy Matthews Elliot, who was born in New York.

The report did not consider whether the founders of the companies were legal or illegal immigrants or the children of legal or illegal immigrants. You can check out the full list here (Appendix A).

The immigration debate isn't simply about how to deal with illegal immigrants, Robbins said. There is a dearth of legal immigrants, he said, to meet the country's economic needs. ""If we want America to compete, we have to have an avenue for the world's talent to get here,"" Robbins said.

The figures in the report may be technically accurate, but as they are presented as demonstrating entrepreneurial exceptionalism by immigrants, they are misleading, said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which believes fewer immigrants should be allowed into the U.S.

Camarota pointed to a 2007 Center for Immigration Studies report which found the self-employment rate for people 25 and older in 2007 was 11.3 percent for immigrants; and 12.6 percent for natives (Table 9). That's a good guidepost of entrepreneurialism, he said, and the numbers suggest that the rates are roughly the same.

""Immigrants are not lacking in entrepreneurship,"" Camarota said. ""But it's also not a distinguishing trait of immigrants.""

Camarota also pointed to a 2000 report he did for the Center for Immigration Studies, which found that the rate of self-employment for immigrants (13.8 percent) outpaced the rate for natives in 1960 (9.6 percent) (Figure 1). But the rate for immigrants and natives largely merged over the ensuing decades.

""You could have argued this 50 years ago, but no longer,"" Camarota said. ""Since 1980, immigration has not been a unique source of entrepreneurship.""

It's also important to look at the context of illegal versus illegal immigration. The self-employment rate was particularly high for immigrants from Korea (30.8 percent); Iran (27.5 percent); Italy (25.2 percent); Vietnam (19.5 percent) and Canada (18.4 percent). It was lowest for immigrants from the Dominican Republic (5.1 percent); Haiti (5.5 percent); Philippines (5.8 percent); Ecuador (7.3 percent) and Mexico (7.8 percent). The largest number of illegal immigrants are coming from that latter group, he said.

Camarota also questioned the relevance of Case's statistic in the context of the current immigration debate. With some of the immigrant-founded companies listed in the report, he said, you are talking about companies founded 100 years ago that have changed dramatically since then.

""The current AT&T is not really the same company,"" Camarota said. ""It has been reassembled so many times. I don't know what this tells us about immigration policy.""

We think it's valid to look at the percentage of companies founded by immigrants or their children to provide some historical context to the immigration debate. But it was not a scientific analysis, and there were some assumptions made -- such as counting as children of immigrants anyone who had one parent who was an immigrant, or including companies spun off from ones founded by immigrants -- that some may legitimately debate. The analysis also includes companies with strength and dominance today that may be more attributable to more recent leaders than their founders.

"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'One Wisconsin Now']","
Group says Gov. Scott Walker’s budget has tax breaks for corporations, the rich “that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade.”
","
We’ve heard a lot about how Wisconsin’s new state budget erases a $3 billion shortfall without raising taxes.

But could it be true that the budget also provides billions of dollars in tax breaks?

On June 24, 2011, two days before Republican Gov. Scott Walker signed the budget into law, this declaration was made by liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now:

""Walker’s budget, includes tax breaks for corporations and the rich that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade.""

Versions of the $2 billion-plus claim have also been made in a joint news release from four left-leaning groups and on at least three occasions by Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha. The state Democratic Party put the $2 billion claim first on its list of ""worst items"" in Walker’s budget.

So, let’s see what’s what.

When asked about the claim, Scot Ross, executive director of One Wisconsin Now, pointed to a June 9, 2011, memo by the non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, long considered by both parties the neutral scorekeeper on budget matters. The memo was written at the request of Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller, D-Monona.

The memo projects that various tax provisions adopted in 2011 will result in a reduction of $2.33 billion in general fund tax revenue over 10 years. That appears to back the One Wisconsin Now claim.

But the claim is a little more complicated than that -- it really has four elements:

""Walker’s budget (1) includes tax breaks for corporations (2) and the rich (3) that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade (4).""

1. ""Walker’s budget""

The group says the $2.3 billion in tax breaks over 10 years is part of the 2011-2013 budget that was proposed by Walker and modified and adopted by the Legislature. But the fiscal bureau reached its projection by considering tax breaks not only in the budget, but in five other business-related measures that were adopted by the Legislature early in 2011.

Ross conceded his group made a ""misstatement."" He noted that less than two weeks earlier, his group had issued a news release that attributed the $2.3 billion figure to both the budget and the earlier action.

One cautionary note.

Todd Berry, president of the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, says it is difficult to project the effects of tax law changes over 10 years: ""It’s so volatile, I just don’t think you can forecast very far out.""

So, the first part of the claim is off because it cited only Walker’s budget -- but that’s relatively minor, since the budget built the earlier tax reductions into its assumptions.

2. ""Tax breaks for corporations""

Ross pointed out that nearly $1.6 billion of the $2.3 billion tax breaks would go to corporations through three tax provisions.

Tax cuts: On production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses. The cuts would apply to small businesses as well as large corporations. The production tax cuts are by far the largest of the breaks, according to the fiscal bureau, resulting in a reduction of an estimated $874 million over 10 years.

""Combined reporting"": A partial rollback of a tax increase that was adopted two years ago on multi-state corporations. The fiscal bureau estimates the rollback would reduce tax revenue by $366 million over 10 years, making it the second-largest tax break.  

Tax deduction: For hiring new full-time employees. Ross argued that regardless of the size of a company, the money from the tax deduction ""is not going to average individual taxpayers."" The new-hire deduction is the third-largest tax break, with an estimated loss in revenue of $335 million over 10 years.

So, many of the tax breaks are geared toward corporations and business. That’s not surprising. The focus of the Walker-called special session of the Legislature in January was on improving the state’s business climate.

3. Tax breaks for ""the rich""

Ross told us a ""a clear majority"" of the remaining $700 million in tax breaks will go to the ""rich.""

Of course, by saying ""clear majority,"" Ross is acknowledging not all of the remaining tax breaks are aimed at the rich. What’s more, there are many differing views of what constitutes the ""rich."" The point behind the loaded language is they don’t help the average taxpayer.

Ross highlighted three tax breaks:

-- Health savings accounts: This legislation allows employees -- not employers -- to deduct contributions they make to their HSAs, which are used to pay medical expenses, from their state income taxes, as they can from their federal income taxes.

Ross cited a May 2008 memo from the U.S. Government Accountability Office that says the average taxpayer who used an HSA in 2005 had an annual adjusted gross income of $139,000. He argues that that figure shows HSAs benefit ""the rich"" because the adjusted gross income of other tax filers was only $57,000.

Berry doesn’t buy that argument. He said large corporations and the rich ""are more likely to have employer-paid health insurance and would not need an HSA."" He noted that nearly every other state allows the deduction, which conforms with federal tax law.

-- Two capital gains changes: One change eliminates state capital-gains taxes on long-term investments in Wisconsin businesses; the other would defer taxes on capital gains reaped anywhere if the proceeds are plowed back into a Wisconsin business. Together, they would result in an estimated tax revenue reduction of $436 million over 10 years.

Ross cited a fiscal bureau report on the two measures that said ""capital gain income is concentrated among high-income taxpayers.""

Berry said eliminating the long-term investment capital gains tax would tend to benefit people with higher incomes. The deferral measure, however, merely delays taxes and isn’t a tax cut, he said.

So, Part 3 of the claim is mixed. Ross himself acknowledged not all of the $700 million in question goes to the wealthy, only a ""clear majority."" But the claim gets support from both the legislative fiscal bureau and the taxpayers alliance, who said the capital gains measures benefit higher-income taxpayers.

4. Tax breaks ""cost"" Wisconsin taxpayers

Ross argued that the tax breaks ""cost"" Wisconsin taxpayers ""because they are reducing the amount of revenue taken in by the state"" and because most taxpayers won’t benefit from them. He added: ""We remain steadfast in our belief that tax breaks are a form of spending.""

But we looked at that question in February 2011 when One Wisconsin Now claimed that $140 million in tax breaks backed by Walker amounted to ""new special interest spending.""  As we concluded then, cutting taxes is ""not spending. You can’t spend what you don’t have."" We gave the group a Pants on Fire on that claim.

Let’s return to the current claim.

One Wisconsin Now said the new state budget ""includes tax breaks for corporations and the rich that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade."" The state fiscal bureau estimates tax breaks will bring in $2.3 billion less in revenue over 10 years. The group attributes it all to the budget, when much of it was in separate legislation.

The group’s larger point -- that the tax breaks benefit corporations and wealthier residents, rather than average taxpayers -- is generally on target, given that the largest amounts of the tax breaks go to businesses and to individuals with higher incomes. But as we said in a past ruling, a tax break is not spending or a ""cost"" to taxpayers. It is money that stays with taxpayers.

The statement contains accurate claims, primarily on who will benefit from newly adopted tax breaks, but shades the language (all in Walker’s budget, a ""cost"" to taxpayers) to amplify its political point.

We rate the statement Half True. ",/factchecks/2011/jul/06/one-wisconsin-now/group-says-gov-scott-walkers-budget-has-tax-breaks/
"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
McDonnell says Texas, under Gov. Perry has created half of U.S. jobs
","
Gov. Bob McDonnell spends plenty of time talking about Virginia’s job climate, but he expanded his horizons in a recent op-ed piece for The Wall Street Journal.

The governor hailed the economic record of Texas, run by his fellow Republican, Gov. Rick Perry.

""Under Gov. Rick Perry’s leadership [Texas] has created more jobs over the last decade than the rest of the states combined,"" McDonnell wrote.

Perry has led Texas since December 2000, when he replaced then-Gov. George W. Bush, who resigned to prepare for his presidency. Perry is considering running for president next year.
McDonnell’s column urged the GOP to nominate a governor for the White House, saying state executives have practical experience dealing with the economy and balancing budgets. McDonnell lauded the records of several Republican governors -- including his own.

We wondered if Perry’s record on creating jobs matched McDonnell’s claim.

Tucker Martin, McDonnell’s director of communications, said the statement was based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s clearinghouse for employment statistics. He also cited a May report by The Business Journals that tabbed Texas as the runaway leader in job creation.

Our research took us down a road traveled by PolitiFact Texas in examining various claims from Perry that most of the jobs created in the U.S. are in the Lone Star State.

PolitiFact Texas has debunked several of these eye-popping claims, noting that they are based on statistics from a minority of states that have had overall job gains in recent years.

According to the BLS, Texas had a net gain of 907,000 jobs between December 2000 and December 2010. The entire payroll in the U.S. grew by 1.6 million jobs during the span.

That means of the 19 states that gained jobs during the first decade of Perry’s governorship, including the District of Columbia, Texas accounted for 56 percent of the gain.

But McDonnell did not say it that way. He wrote that Texas ""has created more jobs over the last decade than the rest of the states combined."" The statistics he cites ignore any positions created in the 31 states where job losses outnumbered gains over that time, and it also fails to capture all positions added in states with job gains.

Consider California, for example, which had a net loss of 340,000 jobs over the decade. Does that that mean no positions were created in California during the span? Of course not. But the figures McDonnell cites do not count any of the new jobs created at Facebook and Google because California’s overall employment dropped.

By excluding all states with net job losses -- regardless of any gains in those states -- the Texas share of new jobs in the U.S. is overblown.

Michael Brandl, a professor at the University of Texas-Austin’s business school, has been critical of Perry’s use of these statistics to bolster his job-creating credentials. ""To say it’s misleading is to be kind,"" he told PolitiFact Texas in 2009. ""It’s just not true.""

Brandl was more circumspect when we recently asked him to assess McDonnell’s claim. He told us it is risky when the Virginia governor -- or anyone -- uses one statistic to make broad inferences about the economy.

""You have to be careful of using one number or data point and thinking it gives insight,"" he said.

A broader look shows Texas has thrived over the last decade, but not at the miracle level McDonnell suggests. Texas is the nation’s second-most populous state, behind California.

The Lone Star state saw a 9.2 percent increase in private-sector jobs, good for sixth-highest in the country. Utah, Montana, Alaska, North Dakota and the District of Columbia beat the Texans, with North Dakota’s private sector job levels growing by almost 20 percent in 10 years.

Texas had an 8.0 percent unemployment rate in May, below the national mark of 9.1 percent, but worse than that of 23 other states. Virginia’s unemployment rate of 6.0 percent tied for 7th with Hawaii, Iowa and Wyoming.


Let’s review.

McDonnell wrote that under Gov. Perry, Texas ""has created more jobs over the last decade than the rest of the states combined.""

But the Virginia governor used net job numbers. Those are different from job creation figures, which are not compiled by the BLS or other national authority. So using net job numbers and calling them job creation figures is a case of comparing apples to oranges.

Austin group says that under Randi Shade, Austin has had the highest city debt per person in Texas
","
In a mailer backing Kathie Tovo over incumbent Austin City Council Member Randi Shade, the Better Austin Today political action committee recently said: ""Under Randi Shade we have had ... the highest city debt per person in Texas.""

Numero uno?

Jeff Jack, the group’s chairman, told us the debt ranking traces to survey results posted online by the Texas Municipal League from asking cities to share their debt levels. Jack said that he added up each city’s debt, listed on the survey, and divided that by each city’s population to come up with per-person totals; Austin, he said, finished first, at $6,291 per person.

""There is quite a range when you start thinking about differences,"" Jack said.

We turned next to the league, whose executive director, Bennett Sandlin, initially cautioned the survey results ""are solely the result of city self-reporting"" and have not been verified.

At our request, the league took its survey results from 2008 through 2010 and calculated each responding city’s per-capita debt. Counting three types of debt -- general obligation, certificates of obligation and revenue-backed -- Austin ranked 10th among Texas cities in 2008 and 2009, at $5,643 per resident and $5,787, respectively, and ninth in 2010, at $6,291, Jack’s cited figure. Notably, much smaller cities showed greater per-person debt each of the years. In 2010, for instance, Johnson City and Galveston had more debt per person; the No. 1 per-person debt in the state appears to have been in Deport, which is 18 miles southeast of the East Texas city of Paris.

So, Austin finished in the top 10 among cities that answered the survey, and it was by far the highest-ranking big city. In 2008 and 2009, cities with greater overall debt per capita topped out in population with Granbury, home to about 8,000 residents. Galveston, higher ranked in 2010, had 57,500 residents to Austin’s more than 750,000.

However, Sandlin cautioned against making city-to-city debt comparisons that fold in outstanding revenue bonds. ""The reason is that, unlike general-obligation and certificates-of-obligation debt, revenue bonds are typically not payable by the citizens through property taxes, but rather by the users of city utilities, such as water or electric (services),"" he wrote. ""Many city utilities serve areas far larger than city limits, so those debts are being serviced by non-citizens and thus might not be a fair measure of how much debt the citizens bear.""

In Austin’s case, Austin Energy, the city-owned electric utility serving residents of Austin plus the rest of Travis County and a portion of Williamson County, has more than $1 billion in outstanding revenue-backed debt and the city’s water utility, airport and convention center together account for more than $2 billion in revenue-supported debt, according to Art Alfaro, the city treasurer. Those debts, to rehash, are to be paid from revenue by the entities that issued them--and not from property tax dollars.

Alfaro said in an interview that any fair city-to-city debt comparisons should be limited to general-obligation debt, the only kind backed by property taxes. Austin’s more than $800 million in this type of debt reflects bonds issued to build streets, libraries, parks and anything needed to run the city, he said, the vast majority approved by voters.

Removing Austin’s revenue-backed debt changes its ranking considerably, the league’s survey results show. By this gauge, Austin was 208th among responding cities, at $871 per resident, in 2008 and 120th in 2009 and 2010, at $1,213 and $1,258, respectively. Not counting revenue-backed debt, among larger cities, Lubbock and Richardson had greater per-capita debt in 2010 and Houston’s per-capita debt was more than the debt for Austin in 2008 and 2009.

By email, Jack said not counting revenue-backed debt doesn’t make sense: ""If a business entity has a cost increase it passes that cost along to the consumer. In the same way revenue bonds, though not going through the (city’s) general fund, increase the cost indirectly through higher utility rates, user fees and the like,"" Jack said. It ""all adds up … it is the total cost that must be considered.""

Separately, we asked Standard & Poor’s, which bestows credit ratings to cities, how it would analyze the per-capita debts of Texas cities. Dallas-based analyst Horatio Aldrete said the firm puts Austin’s ""net debt""--less revenue-related debt but taking into account the general-obligation debts of overlapping jurisdictions such as Travis County and the Austin school district--at $3,664 per person. That’s compared to $3,600 in Dallas, $3,611 in Fort Worth, $4,700 in San Antonio and $4,000 in Houston. Austin, Aldrete said, is ""kind of middle of the pack.""

Aldrete said it doesn’t fold in revenue-related debts because those are absorbed by rate payers, not the city.

The firm’s Austin report says it raised its rating of Austin’s debt to ""AAA"" in 2008 ""based on the likelihood that the city's employment base and fiscal policies should allow it to maintain its strong financial condition even during economic fluctuations such as the current recession.""

Our take? Taking into account all debts linked to the city, including revenue-backed debt, Austin didn’t rank first among Texas cities. And by a fairer comparison--focused on debts funded from property taxes--Austin landed way short of tops in Texas. Also, the statement’s laying of responsibility for the debt ranking on a single council member is unsupported.

"['National', 'Families', 'Income', 'Labor', 'Workers', 'United for a Fair Economy']","
Liberal group says family incomes grew equally prior to 1979, unequally afterward
","
A reader recently sent us a chart posted at the website of MoveOn.org, a liberal group. It aimed to show how incomes across the board rose from the end of World War II until 1979. But then, starting in 1979, they slowed for lower-income Americans while accelerating dramatically for the richest.

The graphic was produced by the group United for a Fair Economy, a group that ""raises awareness that concentrated wealth and power undermine the economy, corrupt democracy, deepen the racial divide, and tear communities apart."" Previously, we rated a bumper sticker the group produced.

The group’s chart represents the growth in income for various income groupings as flowers, with the height of the flower proportionate to the size of the increase. The text says, ""Comparing the growth of U.S. family incomes. 1947-1979 we grew together. 1979-2008 we grew apart.""

The chart provided these statistics for the two periods:

1947-1979: 
Bottom 20 percent of the income distribution: 118 percent increase
Second-to-bottom 20 percent: 100 percent increase
Middle 20 percent: 111 percent increase
Second-to-highest 20 percent: 114 percent increase
Highest 20 percent: 99 percent increase
Highest 5 percent: 86 percent increase

1979-2008: 
Bottom 20 percent of the income distribution: 7 percent decrease
Second-to-bottom 20 percent: 6 percent increase
Middle 20 percent: 11 percent increase
Second-to-highest 20 percent: 23 percent increase
Highest 20 percent: 49 percent increase
Highest 5 percent: 73 percent increase
Highest 1 percent: 224 percent increase

We tracked down the raw data the group used for its calculations, and the group later confirmed that they had used the same statistics in assembling the graph. All but one of the categories -- the calculation for the highest 1 percent -- came from figures published by the U.S. Census Bureau, a source we consider reliable. For the 1979 -2008 Census data, the increases in the chart can be calculated directly. For the 1947-1979 Census data, the figures have to be reverse-engineered, but we were able to replicate the group’s methodology without much difficulty. In both cases, we used inflation-adjusted figures.

Ultimately, our calculations came up with some slightly different numbers, but the tallies were extremely close.

For 1947 to 1979, our increases ranged from 81 percent to 122 percent, depending on the income group, while United for a Fair Economy came up with a range of 86 percent to 118 percent.

For 1979 to 2008, our numbers ranged from a 4 percent decrease to a 73 percent increase, while United for a Fair Economy ranged from a 7 percent decrease to a 73 percent increase.

Since the numbers are close -- and more importantly, since they showed the same overall pattern -- we aren’t going to quibble over the differences.

And what about that final statistic, on the income growth for the top 1 percent from 1979 to 2008? The group pointed to data from economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, who have amassed a trove of data on income inequality.

We ran the numbers and came up with a 169 percent increase for the top 1 percent between 1979 and 2008. That’s less than the 224 percent indicated in the chart. The number is closer if you take the top half of 1 percent -- 213 percent. But even that doesn’t quite get you there.

Economists we contacted suggested that the numbers may have been adjusted to include capital gains, since the original Piketty-Saez data set excluded capital gains, and capital gains are an important income source for the very wealthy. But even if United for a Fair Economy’s final number is off, it’s still a whopping increase in income compared to the statistics for lower- and middle-income brackets.

We also checked with a range of economists to see if the comparison the group was making was somehow unfair. To one degree or another, each of our experts said the comparison was acceptable.

""My impression is that you would find basically the same story using any available tabulation of the inflation-adjusted income series for the U.S.,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution.

Eugene Steuerle, an economist with the Urban Institute, noted some methodological imperfections with these kinds of studies -- including their failure to account for the value of employer-provided health care and Medicare -- but he said he doesn’t doubt the overall trend.

""When all is said and done, there is fairly uniform consensus that starting in the late 1970s, the distribution of income in society became significantly more unequal,"" he said.

Two conservative economists -- Dan Mitchell of the Cato Institute and J.D. Foster of the Heritage Foundation -- raised some of the same methodological concerns as Steuerle, and they also warned against drawing broader conclusions than the data can support.

For instance, both noted that the chart, striking as it is, doesn’t say that someone in the lowest 20 percent is doomed to stay there. ""When you add income mobility to the equation, the left's rich-get-richer-and-poor-get-poorer story gets rather blurry,"" Mitchell said.

Still, despite some modest differences in the final numbers, the story told by the United for a Fair Economy chart strikes us as pretty accurate. So we rate the chart Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/05/united-fair-economy/liberal-group-says-family-incomes-grew-equally-pri/

Sen. Rob Portman says a year since the 'Recovery Summer' there's still no recovery
","
Do you remember the Recovery Summer?

Apparently, not many people do. It was a year ago, and President Barack Obama and the White House said that road-building and other construction projects in the second year of the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (later estimated to cost $830 billion) would pump extra octane into the nation’s economic engine.

Yet the economy, though certainly out of recession, is still struggling, creating a sense of uncertainty that has made Americans slow to build or buy houses and businesses reluctant to expand or spend money.

It’s been ""a year since we announced the summer of recovery,"" U.S. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican,  told Neil Cavuto of Fox Business Network on June 16. ""And you’re right, it has been a fall, winter and spring of no recovery.""

Portman made the same claim during a news conference with Republican colleagues that day, saying, ""Unfortunately, it wasn’t the summer of recovery. In fact, it wasn’t a fall, winter or spring of recovery.""

The mood of the nation sure seems to suggest that at times. But moods and metrics that measure the economy are two different things. Portman has major budget chops, having served as President George W. Bush’s trade ambassador and budget director, but there’s little downside to his party in suggesting that the Democratic administration has bungled the recovery. Fortunately, these things are measurable, so we went gathering metrics.

Portman’s office suggested a comparison with the White House’s own projections of where the economy would stand by now with passage of the 2009 recovery act. The national unemployment rate was supposed to be below 7 percent by now, according to an incoming administration projection in January 2009. Instead, it’s at 9.1 percent.

Total non-farm employment was supposed to be above 137.5 million by now, the same report projected. Instead, it’s 131 million, lower than when Obama took office.

By that standard, said Portman spokeswoman Christine Mangi, ""this could be called a 6.5 million jobs deficit.""

Those early job projections have been through the mill already. Advisers to Obama made them before he even took office. Call them overly optimistic or off-base; either way, they were wrong.

Mangi added a few other measures that we confirmed. The average duration of unemployment is now 39.7 weeks, a recordsince the government began keeping records in 1948.

These are persuasive numbers. Yet Portman spoke specifically of a summer, fall, winter and spring ""of no recovery."" He wasn’t referring to joblessness since Obama entered office. He was citing specific seasons since last summer. There are benchmarks for these seasons, so we examined them.

Unemployment

The seasonally adjusted national unemployment rate was 9.5 in June 2010, when the White House promoted the Recovery Summer. Then its movement resembled that of a yo-yo -- up, down, and back up again (9.1 percent at last count).

In other words, the unemployment rate showed a recovery in one of the seasons but the trend has reversed. It is better now than at the start of the Recovery Summer, though that’s prompting few cheers.

Number of Jobs

By the start of the Recovery Summer, non-farm employment was at 129.9 million, down nearly 3 million from when the recovery act passed.  The number of people working dropped by another 108,000 by the end of last summer.

But by last November -- the Recovery Fall, if you will -- employment rose to 130.1 million, and was at 130.5 million by February. By May 2011, it climbed to 131 million.

Keep in mind that these were private sector job gains, made impressive by the fact that they occurred as local and state governments were actually shedding workers, says Josh Bivens, an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, a think tank that focuses on economic conditions of low- and middle-income Americans. While governments at all levels in this country lost 596,000 jobs since the start of the Recovery Summer, the private sector added 1.7 million jobs, according to figures we checked in Bureau of Labor Statistics databases.

These are steady seasons of gains -- a trend that actually began in October 2010, the month of the Recovery Halloween -- although they’re insufficient to bring the economy out of its doldrums.

At a recent press briefing, White House spokesman Jay Carney contrasted these gains with an economy that was ""in free-fall"" when Obama took office. ""There was a loss of jobs at a pace of 700,000 a month,"" Carney said. We checked his numbers, too. They were solid.

You might wonder why the rise in employment didn’t bring the jobless numbers down. It’s because job growth was insufficient to keep pace with the natural growth of the working age population.

Growth of the U.S. Economy

The gross domestic product, or GDP, is a measure of the country’s output of goods and services, and economists say it is a key number to watch. GDP growth has been sluggish many quarters, but it nevertheless has been positive since the middle of 2009, when the recession ended. It grew by 2.6 percent in the third quarter of 2010, a period that included much of the Recovery Summer, and by 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Had growth continued at that rate, more job creation (and lower unemployment) might have followed. But economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2011 to a meager 1.9 percent.

As we researched this matter, sources mentioned other measures, among them stock market growth (up, though with stops and starts), corporate profits and CEO pay (up) and home prices (down -- and hovering close to where they were in 2003). Consumer confidence is still flagging. Republicans on the congressional Joint Economic Committee, using the pun ""Barack Obama’s Recovery Bummer,"" say that a combination of indicators show that economic conditions today areworse than in any recovery since at least World War II. 

But their figures leave out the fact that the recession that began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009 was deeper than the prior ones. The bigger the hole, the tougher it is to dig out. If you compare job growth since this recession ended with job growth at this stage after the 2001 recession (one that lasted only 8 months), it is stronger today, says Bivens.

So where does all this data leave us? Well, there’s actually more but we’ll spare you. You should know, however, that when the White House announced the Recovery Summer, it set out a goal: By the end of 2010, the recovery act would have created or saved at least 3.5 million jobs since its start. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office as well as Obama’s White House Council of Economic Advisers issued subsequent reports suggesting the goal was met, although their estimates had very wide ranges. That made us wonder if there was a more precise way to define ""recovery.""

We checked with the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private, nonprofit research center whose work is watched closely by the government and universities. It turns out the national bureau doesn’t use that word.

So we finally called James Feyrer, a Dartmouth College economist who conducted research for the national bureau on the question, ""Did the stimulus stimulate?"" (His short answer: ""Yes. I think in the aggregate it did create positive stimulus for the economy."" The longer answer is that some parts -- support for low-income households and infrastructure spending -- worked while grants to states for education did not appear to create additional jobs.)

Asked about the no-recovery claim, he said, ""I think the problem with that is that ‘recovery’ is in the eye of the beholder."" The nation is out of recession, he said, ""but we certainly are not having a robust recovery. It seems like we’re somewhere in the gap between where rhetoric and reality fall.""

Assessing Portman’s claim comes down to how you view the recovery -- not since the start of Obama’s presidency but since the start of the Recovery Summer, because that’s specifically what Portman was talking about. There have been successive  seasons of GDP growth, though not consistently strong. The White House met its own standard, however imprecise it may have been (the goal of ""saving"" jobs is hard to measure). Private-sector job growth struck Bivens as noteworthy, especially when compared with the 2001 recession. But unemployment is still a big problem.

Economists talk of an anemic recovery, but a recovery, nonetheless. Portman, on the other hand, said that ""it wasn’t the summer of recovery,"" nor was it ""a fall, winter or spring of recovery.""

That’s how he sees it, and it’s understandable that anyone without a job could see it that way too.

But too many metrics present a different impression, showing there has been a recovery -- a weak one. It’s not all sunshine and rainbows, but it hasn’t been season after season of gloom, either.

Portman’s statement contains some element of truth, but it ignores facts that would give a different impression. The Truth-O-Meter has a precise definition for such a claim: Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/05/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-year-recovery-summer-theres-s/

Republicans blame Blue Dog Democrats for federal ""spending spree""
","
Members of Congress are bickering over the debt ceiling, which means they’re also arguing over who’s to blame for the national debt.

Recently, nearly identical news releases from the National Republican Congressional Committee targeted two moderate Georgia Democrats.

""John Barrow and his fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out,"" read one.

""Sanford Bishop and his fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out,"" read the other.

Are Congressmen Barrow, Bishop and their fellow Democrats really responsible for maxing out the federal credit card?

Fortunately for Georgia’s Truth-O-Meter, our sister site PolitiFact Ohio has already looked into an NRCC news release about Democrat U.S. Rep. Betty Sutton. It was also sent May 18.

""Betty Sutton and her fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out,"" it read.

Sound familiar? The NRCC sent about five dozen news releases just like it May 18, each targeting a different member of Congress.

Even though the U.S. House of Representatives voted to reject the debt ceiling increase May 31, the blame game is likely to continue. Lawmakers are trying to broker a deal before Aug. 2, when the U.S. Department of Treasury says it will be unable to pay the bills unless it borrows more money.

Now back to the NRCC. PolitiFact Ohio decided its accusation against Sutton was Barely True. Republicans and Democrats share the blame.

Tax cuts on higher-income earners passed under President George W. Bush and backed by Republicans played a substantial role in the nation’s annual deficits, according to the Congressional Research Service, which provides nonpartisan policy and legal analysis to Congress.  

Some argued the cuts can actually pay for themselves by stimulating economic growth. But PolitiFact has previously found that the Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers say that tax cuts led to revenue totals that are lower than they otherwise would have been -- even if they spur some economic growth.

Extending all of them permanently, as many in the GOP would like, would cost $3.3 trillion over 10 years and increase deficits.
   
The recession hurt federal tax revenue as well. Add in the cost of the wars that began under Bush and continue under President Barack Obama, and you’ve got a good-sized debt, the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities argues.

Just two policies dating from the Bush administration -- tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- accounted for more than $500 billion of the deficit in 2009 ""and will account for $7 trillion in deficits in 2009 through 2019, including the associated debt-service costs,"" the center said.
   
A federal budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation begs to differ. He said the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities cherry-picked spending and tax policies that liberals dislike and blamed them for the entire problem. They could have easily scapegoated Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare or any number of other programs with bipartisan appeal.

We think it’s safe to say that both Republicans and Democrats are cherry-picking their data. Expenditures backed by both parties have helped put the federal government in the red.

And now we focus on Barrow, who hails from Savannah, and Bishop, who is from Albany. Both are congressional veterans. Both are Blue Dog Democrats, or a group of moderates in Congress who pride themselves on fiscal conservatism. Both faced tougher-than-expected re-election races in 2010.  

Both voted against raising the debt ceiling in the May 31 vote. And they both represent districts that Republicans think they can win.

An NRCC spokeswoman cited various votes they made as evidence that Barrow and Bishop are spendthrifts. Both voted for the 2009 stimulus package, for instance. They also voted to raise the debt limit in December 2009 and February 2010.

But as Blue Dog Democrats, Barrow and Bishop supported efforts to cut the deficit by $4 trillion over the next 10 years and eliminate programs that are out of date, inefficient or duplicate the efforts of another program, according to statements by the group.

Barrow is chairman of the Blue Dog policy committee, which hammered out the group’s initiatives on balancing the budget and cutting spending.  

Barrow spokesman Christopher Cashman argued that the NRCC cherry-picked from the congressman’s record when it argued he was on a spending spree. Those votes are only a tiny portion of the ballots he has cast during his congressional career. Cashman brought up more than a dozen other votes and initiatives as proof that his boss is no big spender.

They included three 2011 votes for spending cuts. Bishop voted with Barrow in all of them.

Also, Barrow and Bishop co-sponsored a bill that calls for amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget.

Barrow and Bishop have voted for spending bills, but members of Congress of all stripes vote to spend money. That’s part of their job.

Once again, the NRCC is guilty of cherry-picking. Whether you agree with their individual votes, the records of these Blue Dog Democrats show it’s unfair to say they’re on a ""spending spree.""

Since these Georgians are keeping an eye on the nation’s credit card statement, we rule the NRCC’s statement False.",/factchecks/2011/jul/05/national-republican-congressional-committee/republicans-blame-blue-dog-democrats-federal-spend/

Outdated quote from Ted Cruz misleads on evangelical voter turnout
","Social media is flush with posts that aim to encourage voter turnout by Election Day, Nov. 3. But one such Facebook post features a portrait of Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and a quote that, in the context of 2020, is both misleading and factually problematic. The Oct. 1 Facebook post shows the Texas lawmaker in front of American and Texas flags, and quotes him as saying, ""In the last election, 54 million evangelical Christians stayed home. If Christians will simply show up and vote our values, we’ll turn this country around."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Although the post is correct to attribute these words to Cruz, it leaves out important context: Cruz said this in 2015 and he was referring to the 2012 election, which resulted in President Barack Obama winning a second term. When Cruz was running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, he used this 54 million figure multiple times. In fact, Cruz made the exact statement seen in the post. It was during a taped interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network’s David Brody in July 2015. ""There are 90 million evangelical Christians in the United States — it’s about 30 percent of our population,"" Cruz said. ""In the last election 54 million evangelical Christians stayed home. If Christians will simply show up and vote our values, we’ll turn this country around."" PolitiFact reached out to Cruz to see what evidence he had to support his claim, but he did not respond to our request for comment.  In 2015, there was some pushback to the numbers in Cruz’s claim. News reports noted that it is difficult to define and identify ""evangelicals."" The Cook Political Report took an in-depth look at Cruz’s suggestion that evangelicals disengaged in 2012 found ""no evidence of a ‘slump’"" in the evangelical turnout for Sen. Mitt Romney in 2012. ""In 2004, evangelical voters made up 23 percent of the electorate and George W. Bush carried that group with 78 percent,"" an archived version of the article reads. ""In 2012, evangelical voters made up an even larger share of the electorate — 26 percent — and Romney won this group with an equal 78 percent of the vote."" Post-election research from the Pew Research Center found similar results: evangelicals supported Romney as much as they supported Republican candidates in prior elections.  ""White evangelical Protestants voted as heavily for Romney as they did for the GOP candidates in 2008 and 2004, and they made up about the same share of the electorate as they did in the two previous elections,"" reads the Pew report. Jeanine Kraybill is an associate professor of political science at California State University, Bakersfield, who has extensively studied the intersection of politics and religion. Over the last several years, Kraybill said estimates have indicated there are between 90 million and 100 million evangelicals in the U.S. ""It is important to note that evangelical can be loosely defined. Some measures also do not take into account Black evangelicals and some consider ‘born again’ and evangelical two different things,"" Kraybill added.

Biden-Harris Arizona event had no fanfare because the campaign didn’t invite the public

SC Rep. Cunningham did not vote for $5M in tax funds to go to campaign coffers
","Nancy Mace, the Republican challenger in a House race in South Carolina, parlayed a debate question about high-speed internet into an attack on Democratic Rep. Joe Cunningham. ""We can’t get funding and resources for rural broadband if we’re sending and voting for $5 million that you voted for, to go into your campaign coffers to pay for your ...personal expenses, that pay for your TV ads,"" Mace charged. ""All those things — $5 million. Well, who’s going to pay that bill? The taxpayers."" Mace’s campaign said she was referring to Cunningham’s vote for HR 1, called the ""For the People Act,"" a bill under consideration that would establish an alternative campaign funding system for House and presidential offices.  Her attack is a mixed bag: An eligible House candidate’s campaign could receive a maximum of $5 million in federal funds — and that comes with restrictions. The funds would not come from a tax, but rather from a fee added to criminal and civil fines, and court settlements. Separately — and unrelated to the bill’s matching funds provisions — the legislation would allow candidates to use campaign funds for certain personal expenses, such as health insurance. The race pitting Mace, a state representative since 2018, against first-time House member Cunningham is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. The Cook Political Report rates the match-up as ""lean Democratic,"" meaning the race is competitive but Cunningham has an advantage. HR 1, introduced in January 2019, is a sweeping bill that would make changes to laws aimed at making it easier to vote, increasing election security and improving campaign finance transparency. It passed the House in March, with all Democrats voting yes and all Republicans voting no. No action has been taken in the GOP-controlled Senate. A service used by GovTrack.us, which tracks Congress, gives the bill a 4% chance of becoming law. The provision Mace zeroed in on would use public financing to provide House and presidential candidates with matching funds for six times the amount of campaign donations of up to $200. So, for every $200 in these smaller donations, the federal government would pay $1,200 to the campaign.  But not all candidates would be allowed to receive matched donations. To be eligible, a candidate would have to raise $50,000 in small-dollar donations from at least 1,000 individuals during the qualifying period, and they would have to agree to accept no contributions larger than $1,000.  The total matching funds available to any individual candidate would be limited to $5 million. The matching funds would not come from a tax but, based on an amendment to the original bill, from a new ""Freedom From Influence Fund"" under the U.S. Treasury. It would collect funds from a 2.75% fee assessed on criminal and civil fines and penalties or settlements with banks and corporations that commit corporate malfeasance. The bill would also allow the use of campaign funds for certain personal expenses, such as health insurance. But that exception would not apply to incumbents such as Cunningham. Generally, campaign funds can be used for advertising, among other expenses. Mace said Cunningham voted for $5 million in taxpayer funds to go into his campaign coffers and politicians like him ""that pay your personal expenses, that pay for your TV ads."" Cunningham voted for a bill that would pay federal matching funds to House candidate campaigns — but it would not be automatic and would not necessarily come to $5 million. In order to receive the matching funds, candidates would need to meet certain requirements that limit the size of the donations they accept. And the maximum match under any scenario would be $5 million. The funds would not come from a tax, but from a fee assessed to criminal and civil fines. A separate provision would allow challengers, but not incumbent candidates like Cunningham, to use campaign funds generally to pay for certain personal expenses, such as health insurance.  We rate the statement Half True.

Lucy McBath didn’t vote to release murderers, rapists from prison
","An attack ad against  Rep. Lucy McBath, D-Ga., accuses her of voting to release murderers and rapists onto the streets of Georgia.  The National Republican Congressional Committee ad supports Republican Karen Handel, who lost her spot in the House to McBath in 2018. The 6th District rematch is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking.  In the ad, the camera follows a woman jogging in a park, with heavy breathing in the background audio. A narrator says, ""We moved here for peace of mind, safety, but now crime has gotten out of control, and Lucy McBath voted to release criminals from prison. Murderers, rapists.""  Handel is running a campaign reminiscent of President Donald Trump’s push for ""law and order,"" and she previously released an ad that accused McBath of being soft on crime and supportive of violent protesters, which we rated False.  The NRCC ad is consistent with this attack line. But we found that it leaves out important context and gives a misleading impression.  The ad’s fine print cites McBath’s vote for H.R. 6800, a $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill that did not become law. McBath voted with other House Democrats in favor of the measure, one part of which mandated the release of prisoners vulnerable to COVID-19. However, another provision in the bill explicitly bars the release of prisoners deemed to be a risk for violence.  H.R. 6800, known as the HEROES Act, is a proposed bill meant to respond to various aspects of the COVID-19 crisis. The bill, which passed the House but stalled in the Senate, would provide $3.4 trillion of coronavirus relief, including assistance to state and local governments and hazard pay for frontline health care workers. The part that’s relevant to the NRCC’s claims come from a 44-page portion of the 1,800-page bill. This section was written to address the fact that prison inmates have been among those hardest hit by the pandemic. It requires the Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Marshal Service to place into home confinement prisoners who are within a year of being released, juveniles, pregnant, over 50 years old or have health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, HIV, or cancer. The bill specifically bars the release of inmates deemed to be a risk for violence. It does not define that criteria. Here’s language directly from the bill: The Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Marshal Service ""may not place in community supervision any individual if the court determines, after a hearing and the attorney for the Government shows by clear and convincing evidence based on individualized facts, that detention is necessary because the individual’s release will pose a specific and substantial risk that the individual will cause bodily injury or use violent force against the person of another.""  The NRCC didn’t respond to our request for comment. However, a document posted on its website notes that ""the vague language of H.R. 6800 does not rule out the release of violent prisoners.""  By raising the issue of rising crime in Georgia and referencing McBath’s vote for the HEROES Act in a single breath, the ad seems to be implying that the legislation has contributed to rising crime in McBath’s district.  However, the HEROES Act hasn’t been enacted, so it can’t be linked to any crime trend.  In addition, the ad leaves out the important context that the bill doesn’t call for inmates to be released into the general public.  ""People are not being sent home from jail,"" said Kanya Bennett, senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, summarizing the bill’s intent. ""They’re being sent to home confinement and still under the supervision of the Bureau of Prisons. That’s a very important distinction to make.""  A campaign ad claims that ""Lucy McBath voted to release criminals from prison. Murderers, rapists.""  McBath voted for a coronavirus relief package that would have allowed for the home confinement of some prisoners with health issues or near the end of their sentence. That bill does not rule out murderers and rapists explicitly, but it says prisoners deemed to be a risk for violence are ineligible for home confinement.

No, video of Harris from 2019 doesn’t prove she lied about fracking in VP debate
","An article shared widely on Facebook wrongly claims that Sen. Kamala Harris was ""caught in a major lie"" over Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s position on fracking. The Oct. 7 article from the Western Journal, a conservative news and political commentary website, says Harris’ comments during the Oct. 7 vice presidential debate flew in the face of ""a history of promises"" she and Biden had made to ban hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article juxtaposes Harris’s comment during the vice presidential debate with a much different comment the California senator made more than a year earlier. Other Facebook posts that drew similar traffic have paired video footage of the two comments back to back. ""Joe Biden will not end fracking,"" Harris said during the debate, in response to Vice President Mike Pence’s false claim to the contrary. ""He has been very clear about that."" ""There’s no question, I’m in favor of banning fracking,"" Harris said some 13 months earlier, in response to an activist’s question during a Sept. 4, 2019, town hall hosted by CNN. Taken side by side, the two quotes show two different positions. But that doesn’t mean she was lying during the vice presidential debate. There’s a key detail that explains her shift: Harris is now Biden’s running mate, meaning she is tied to his platform. When she made the initial comment in 2019, she was a primary presidential candidate running against Biden and vying for the party’s nomination with her own positions.   Biden’s official campaign platform does not call for a ban on fracking, although the former vice president’s past comments from the campaign trail have led to some confusion on his stance. During a March debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders, for example, Biden said he supported ""no new fracking"" — a comment his campaign later clarified, saying he was only referring to his stated policy calling for a ban on new permits for oil and gas drilling on federally owned lands.  George Upper, the Western Journal’s editor in chief, pointed in an email to other comments Biden has made that appeared to reflect an anti-fracking stance, such as a moment where he told an activist in September 2019, ""I guarantee you, we’re going to end fossil fuel.""  ""Harris is on the record with multiple similar statements,"" Upper said. But Biden’s plan isn’t as simple as he’s sometimes made it seem. After he said during a July 2019 debate that he would ""work (fossil fuels) out,"" his campaign clarified that he supports eliminating subsidies for fossil fuels and a gradual shift toward clean energy with the goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Both proposals are listed on his campaign website. According to Biden’s campaign website, he supports ""banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters."" PolitiFact has fact-checked several statements — including false claims from President Donald Trump and his reelection campaign — about Biden and fracking. Biden says that he won’t shut down existing fracking operations on public land, and that he’ll allow fracking to continue on private lands, where most of it takes place. Regardless, Harris was speaking for her own candidacy in 2019 when she said she was in favor of banning fracking. She wasn’t ""caught in a major lie"" during the vice presidential debate.

No, Harris didn’t say Americans aren’t equipped to make decisions about the coronavirus
","The vice presidential debate was about 90 minutes long, but a recent Facebook post argues you could’ve tuned out for almost the whole event.  ""If you ignore the entire debate… and focus on just 1 statement made by each candidate… it would be this one, because IT SPEAKS VOLUMES,"" the post says. ""The rest is just noise.""  It goes on to describe an exchange between Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee: ""Trump and I trust the American people to make choices for themselves and their families — Harris and Biden want to mandate how you care for yourself,"" Pence said, according to the post. The statement is circled with the word ""Freedom"" written beside it.  The post says Harris replied: ""The American people aren’t equipped to make these decisions for themselves."" That statement is circled with the word ""Tyrany"" written and misspelled beside it.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  It’s a mischaracterization of the actual debate night exchange — and the quote attributed to Harris does not approximate her actual statements.

Many of the people who were at that event, Susan, actually were tested for coronavirus, and it was an outdoor event, which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advise. The difference here is President Trump and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interest of their health. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris consistently talk about mandates, and not just mandates with the coronavirus, but a government takeover of health care, the Green New Deal, all government control. We’re about freedom and respecting the freedom of the American people."" Harris replied: ""Let’s talk about respecting the American people. You respect the American people when you tell them the truth. You respect the American people when you have the courage to be a leader. Speaking of those things that you may not want people to hear, but they need to hear so they can protect themselves. But this administration stood on information that, if you had as a parent, if you had as a worker, knowing you didn’t have enough money saved up, and now you’re standing in a food line because of the ineptitude of an administration that was unwilling to speak the truth to the American people. So let’s talk about caring about the American people. The American people have had to sacrifice far too much because of the incompetence of this administration. It is asking too much of the people — it is asking too much of the people that they would not be equipped with the information they need to help themselves to protect their parents and their children.""  The Facebook post misquotes Pence but it comes close to something he actually said. He was arguing that he and the president trust Americans to make the best choices for themselves while Harris and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden want to mandate how people must respond to the coronavirus pandemic. But the post’s attack on Harris is a misfire. She didn’t say ""American people aren’t equipped"" to make decisions about the pandemic for themselves.

Biden says billionaires gained $800 billion, but study looks at growth since market bottomed out
","When Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden visited Manitowoc on Sept. 21, his stop – at the Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry – had a blue-collar bent. So did his message. ""President talks all the time about how great the economy is,"" Biden told a group of workers. But, he noted, many places and sectors are not doing well amid the economic fallout of COVID-19, unemployment remains high and many Americans are at risk of losing their homes. Then he drew a sharp contrast:  ""Now, the billionaires in this country are seeing their wealth increase by $800 billion,"" Biden said: ""Let me explain that again: all the billionaires in America, during the pandemic, their net worth combined, according to studies, have increased by $800 billion.""  Is Biden right? When asked for backup on the claim, a representative for Biden’s campaign pointed to an update of a report by the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning Washington D.C. think tank.  The report, ""Billionaire Bonanza 2020,"" was done by the institute in partnership with Americans for Tax Fairness. The latter falls under the non-profit New Venture Fund, which is managed by a for-profit company, Arabella Advisors, that consults on philanthropy.  They used numbers from two features by Forbes. The first, is Forbes’ annual list of billionaires, ""The Richest in 2020,"" which was published April 7. That list was compiled based on stock prices and exchange rates on March 18. That would be one week after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic on March 11. (Trump declared a national emergency on March 13.) The second is Forbes’ ""The World’s Real-Time Billionaires,"" an online list that tracks the net worth of billionaires using that day’s stock prices and exchange rates. For its analysis, the group compared the two, and linked to a spreadsheet that showed the change in the billionaires’ net worth between March 18 and Sept. 15 was $845.1 billion.  To be sure, not all billionaires gained during the time period, and not all billionaires listed had net worth numbers associated with them. But the overall change tracks well with what Biden said. That said, there is a wrinkle to discuss. The data used by the think tank roughly covers the period from when the coronavirus was formally declared a pandemic. But by that point, the coronavirus had been spreading around the globe for several months -- and already had an effect on stock prices and wealth. While there is no measuring stick available to begin the tally from January, it’s safe to say that picture would be somewhat different. The Institute for Policy Studies did not respond to email requests for comment from PolitiFact Wisconsin. But Timothy Smeeding, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor of public affairs, noted there was some decline in the stock market prior to that low point at the end of March. Since then, it has overall been improving.  So, the study only looks at gains during the bounceback from a very low point in the market. That may serve to exaggerate the growth during the pandemic at least to some degree. Citing a study, Biden claimed that billionaires in America saw their net worth grow by $800 billion during the pandemic. That number tracks with what the study found. And, while the dates in the study do not match up perfectly with when the coronavirus was declared a pandemic, they are close.  That said, the effects of COVID-19 on things such as the stock market were being felt before the pandemic declaration, so the timetable being used may exaggerate the growth a bit because it uses a low starting point.

Facebook post misattributes debate remarks to Kamala Harris
","On Oct. 7, Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris debated for the first and only time before Election Day.  But a recent Facebook post suggests that the debate was rigged — that unlike Pence, Harris knew the debate questions ahead of time.  ""Kamala said to the moderator ‘yes, that’s a great segway to the next question,’"" the post says, misspelling segue.

About 20 minutes and 45 seconds into the debate — you can read the transcript here — Page asked Harris if voters have a right to know more detailed information about presidential candidates and presidents.  ""Absolutely,"" Harris said, ""and that’s why Joe Biden has been so incredibly transparent.""  Harris then pivoted to attacking President Donald Trump for a lack of transparency about his health and his personal finances.  Pence, given the opportunity to respond, defended Trump and said he’s a job creator who ""turned this economy around by cutting taxes, rolling back regulations, unleashing American energy, fighting for free and fair trade."" Pence was over his speaking time and Page interrupted him three times to move on before he finished by saying all of the aforementioned accomplishments were in danger if Biden and Harris were elected.

Trump ad takes Fauci out of context
","A new campaign ad from President Donald Trump uses an out-of-context quote from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, to tout Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 214,000 Americans. ""President Trump tackled the virus head-on, as leaders should,"" the narrator of the ad says, before panning to Fauci to hammer home the point. ""I can’t imagine that … anybody could be doing more,"" Fauci is shown saying.   The comment from Fauci was in reference to the White House coronavirus task force and the broader government response, not to Trump. It's also almost seven months old. In a statement to CNN, Fauci said he felt his words were taken out of context. The 30-second spot, titled ""Carefully,"" highlights Trump’s recent bout with the coronavirus and claims the U.S. is ""recovering"" from the pandemic. The ad was uploaded to YouTube Oct. 10, the same day the U.S. reported its highest number of new COVID-19 cases since mid August. The ad also flashes clips of Trump wearing masks — a measure he has repeatedly criticized and taken sparingly in public settings since his first time wearing one in public in July.  Fauci’s comment was clipped from a March 22 interview with Fox News host and radio personality Mark Levin. The ad gives the impression that Fauci was talking specifically about Trump when he said, ""I can’t imagine that … anybody could be doing more.""  But that’s misleading, as other fact-checkers and news outlets have noted — and as Fauci said to CNN. Taken in full context, Fauci was actually speaking about the workload facing the White House coronavirus task force at the start of the pandemic and the scale of the federal government’s mobilization as U.S. cases began to flare. ""The comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public health officials,"" Fauci told CNN, adding that he’s never publicly endorsed a political candidate. RELATED: Timeline: How Donald Trump responded to the coronavirus pandemic The White House coronavirus task force has been led by Vice President Mike Pence since late February. The group included medical doctors and scientists from public health agencies in addition to national security officials and political appointees. Asked about the ad’s use of Fauci’s remark, a Trump campaign spokesperson told PolitiFact the ad was talking about the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus, and so was Fauci.  Another campaign official told Business Insider, ""It’s the president’s coronavirus task force."" Levin did ask Fauci if he had ""ever seen this big of a coordinated response by an administration to such a threat"" as the coronavirus. Here’s Fauci’s response, with the relevant quote in bold: ""Well, we've never had a threat like this, and the coordinated response has been — there are a number of adjectives to describe it. Impressive, I think, is one of them. I mean, we're talking about all hands on deck. I, as one of many people on a team — I'm not the only person — since the beginning that we even recognized what this was, I have been devoting almost full time on this, almost full time. I'm down at the White House virtually every day with the task force. I'm connected by phone throughout the day and into the night. When I say night, I'm talking 12, 1, 2 in the morning. I'm not the only one. There's a whole group of us that are doing that. It's every single day. So, I can't imagine that, under any circumstances, that anybody could be doing more."" Fauci did not mention Trump by name in his answer, although he did go on to mention the ""very timely decision on the part of the president"" to restrict travel coming in from China while talking about mitigation efforts that could be used to slow the spread. The interview came on March 22, when the U.S. had recorded roughly 34,800 confirmed cases and about 570 deaths from the coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. leads the world with more than 7.7 million cases and 214,000 deaths logged to date. The Trump campaign ad’s message of a nation bouncing back from the pandemic is at odds with more recent comments from Fauci.  Speaking virtually with American University on Oct. 6, Fauci said the U.S. is facing ""a resurgence of the wave we began with"" and that ""the models tell us if we don’t do what we need to in the fall and winter, we could have 300,000 to 400,000 COVID-19 deaths."" Fauci also called the White House event with Judge Amy Coney Barrett, Trump’s pick to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, a ""superspreader event."" Trump announced that he tested positive for the coronavirus days after the event, which featured little social distancing or mask wearing. The White House has not said how Trump contracted COVID-19. The ad says Trump is ""recovering from the coronavirus."" The White House physician said Oct. 10 that Trump is ""no longer considered a transmission risk,"" but he did not say whether Trump was still experiencing symptoms or whether he had tested negative for the virus, per NPR. A Trump campaign ad claims Fauci said of Trump’s pandemic response, ""I can’t imagine that … anybody could be doing more."" The ad’s use of Fauci’s quote is misleading. Fauci made the comment nearly seven months before the ad was released, and he was not talking about Trump. He told CNN he did not consent to being in the ad and felt he was taken out of context. The full context of the quote shows that Fauci was talking about the White House coronavirus task force and the mobilization of the federal government more generally. Overall, the ad’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

No, Underwood did not call riots ‘beautiful’
","U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood’s Republican challenger is running an ad that paints the first-term Democratic congresswoman as a supporter of acts of violence and property destruction. Illinois state Sen. Jim Oberweis’ ad includes footage of Underwood responding to a question about whether she condemns ""rioting and looting"" during an endorsement session with the Chicago Sun-Times editorial board. ""With respect to rioting and looting, I think that we have seen many instances of beautiful protests,"" Underwood says in a video clip featured in the ad, which abruptly cuts into a digitally-altered echo of her saying those last two words over footage of burning cars and ransacked buildings in Kenosha, Wis., Chicago and suburban Aurora. ""Riots are not beautiful, they’re ugly,"" the ad’s narrator says. ""Vote against rioters, and anyone who enables them. Vote against Lauren Underwood."" The vast majority of demonstrations across the nation against racial injustice since George Floyd was killed by police in Minnesota in May have been peaceful, a report from the Princeton University-affiliated U.S. Crisis Monitor found. Violence has erupted on some occasions, however, causing property damage, injuries and even deaths. And Republicans up and down the ticket have sought to conflate support for the peaceful protests as backing the violence. So we decided to look into what Underwood said to see if it lined up with how Oberweis’ ad portrayed her stance. We reviewed a video of the Sun-Times endorsement session cited in the ad. While Underwood does not directly condemn ""rioting and looting"" during that appearance, taken in the full context of her remarks it is a stretch to suggest her praise of ""beautiful protests"" extends to looting and rioting. About 20 minutes into the candidates’ joint appearance, the paper’s editorial page editor Tom McNamee asks Underwood twice to address several arguments Oberweis had raised, including the senator’s charge that she has not condemned ""rioting and looting."" ""He says you once called him a racist, and he says you have failed to condemn rioting,"" McNamee says in the video, to which Underwood responds by explaining she believes ads Oberweis has run during his political career ""walk that line that I would call racist."" Then Underwood turns to the second part of McNamee’s question, saying, ""I also, with respect to rioting and looting, I think that we have seen many instances of beautiful protests this summer as people have stood up for this cause of justice and equality."" After that, Underwood makes a reference to Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from her congressional district charged with killing two people and injuring a third in an attack on demonstrators in Kenosha following the police shooting of Jacob Blake. ""I don’t think that that kind of violence has any place in our community and certainly in a way to intimidate or disrupt peaceful protest,"" Underwood of Naperville says in the Sun-Times video. A spokeswoman for Underwood’s campaign said she was describing the peaceful protests she witnessed this summer in her district when she used the word ""beautiful."" In a phone interview, Oberweis pointed to Underwood’s remarks during the Sun-Times interview to back up his ad. He told us he believes Underwood was describing ""rioting and looting"" as part of the ""beautiful protests"" she referenced when she spoke. During another joint appearance the following week, however, Underwood made clear she opposes the violence that has marred some protests. Oberweis had raised the issue during that appearance as well. ""I think it’s really important that we continue to lift up the peaceful protesters, those who are exercising their First Amendment rights, but it is a tragedy when people are injured, when there’s violence, when there’s damage and the like as a result of these types of demonstrations,"" Underwood told editors and reporters from the Daily Herald and Shaw Media. ""That’s not appropriate."" Oberweis’ ad says Underwood described riots as ""beautiful protests."" During the editorial board appearance the ad is based on, Underwood pivoted away from a question about ""rioting and looting"" by steering the conversation back to the kind of protests she supports. The ad left out that she went on to say the ""beautiful protests"" were in reference to people who ""stood up for this cause of justice and equality.""

 If a President Biden left office, Nancy Pelosi would not become vice president
","Even though the 2020 presidential election has yet to occur, people are already thinking about what would happen if the newly elected president left office. ""If Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden wins the election but cannot serve his full term, vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris would assume the role of president and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would become vice president,"" reads a popular Facebook post. ""LET THAT SINK IN!"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  This isn’t how vice presidential succession works. The post got the first piece right: If the president is impeached, resigns, or is otherwise incapacitated, the vice president becomes president. ""In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President,"" reads the U.S. Constitution. This has happened throughout American history. When President Abraham Lincoln died, his vice president, Andrew Johnson, became president. When President William McKinley died, Theodore Roosevelt took his place. But if the vice president becomes president, then what happens to the empty vice presidential slot? It’s not surprising people would be confused by this question. For much of American history, the government didn’t have much of an answer. The vice president simply wasn’t replaced because a process wasn’t codified in the Constitution. ""Our Constitution's framers created the vice presidency almost as an afterthought,"" explains the U.S. Senate website. ""The 20th century began without a vice president. Vice President Garret Hobart had died in November 1899, leaving the office vacant, as it had been on 10 previous occasions for periods ranging from a few months to nearly four years. The nation had gotten along just fine. No one much noticed Hobart’s absence."" But that changed as time went on. ""The absence of any provision for filling a vice-presidential vacancy had become intolerable in the modern era,"" continues the U.S. Senate website. So after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Congress passed the 25th Amendment to the Constitution. According to the new amendment, if a vice presidential vacancy opens up, the president can nominate a replacement.  ""Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress,"" reads the 25th Amendment.  This rule was first put into practice in 1973, when Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned. Richard Nixon was president at the time, and he nominated Gerald R. Ford to take over the role. The House and Senate confirmed the nomination, and Ford took office. When Nixon resigned the next year, Ford became president and nominated Nelson A. Rockefeller as vice president. So if Biden became president and left office early, Kamala Harris would indeed become the new president.  But Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, wouldn’t become vice president. Instead, Harris would choose the new vice president, and the House and Senate would vote on her choice.  The poster may be confused by the Presidential Succession Act, which says that if both the president and vice president die or are incapacitated, the speaker of the House is next in line to become president. Some people believe the Presidential Succession Act is unconstitutional, but that’s for another day.

No, Tillis didn't oppose military raises or boost his own pay
","A new campaign ad claims U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis isn’t doing enough for the military. The ad by VoteVets, a left-leaning campaign committee, attempts to highlight the military career of Tillis’ Democratic opponent Cal Cunningham. Political experts believe the North Carolina race could determine which political party wins a majority in the Senate. A woman in the ad says Tillis voted ""against a pay raise for a military, while voting for a pay raise for himself.""  Those words also appear on screen. So are they true? Not really. For this ad, VoteVets cherry-picked two sections of a massive budget bill and it ignores Tillis’ other efforts to raise military pay. The ad cites a March 23, 2018 vote on HR 1625 for both of its claims about pay. HR 1625, which became law, is also known as the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 or the ""omnibus bill."" That means it funded multiple areas of government, from the Commerce and Justice departments to other special projects. The bill was controversial among many Republicans who thought its $1.3 trillion price tag was too high. Tillis wasn’t the only Republican to vote against it. (Others went so far as to encourage Trump to veto the bill.) Trump complained that the bill didn’t include enough funding for more wall construction on the southern border. But he signed it anyway, all the while calling it ""ridiculous"" and saying he would ""never sign another bill like this again.""  The bill did include a 2.4% raise for troops, which the White House said was the largest pay raise since 2010. And it funded raises that Tillis and others had already approved. Tillis supported a military pay raise authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act, which was signed just three months before the omnibus bill. In June 2017, Tillis touted his subcommittee’s approval of military raises for the NDAA. That September, he voted for the NDAA. And in December 2017, President Trump signed the bill -- and its 2.4% raise for military service members --  into law. In March, the omnibus bill (the same one mentioned in the VoteVets ad) guaranteed funding for those NDAA raises. ""As Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee, Senator Tillis worked across the aisle to authorize a pay raise for service members in the NDAA,"" Tillis spokesman Andrew Romeo said. ""Senator Tillis supported a wide range of priorities that were funded in the bill, including the pay raise for service members that Senator Tillis successfully advanced during the NDAA process,"" Romeo said. The ad’s claim about raises for Senators is misleading. The omnibus bill didn’t introduce a new salary for senators, so much as cancel a raise that was already scheduled to take place. The Constitution allows members of Congress to set their own salaries, but there’s a catch: the 27th Amendment says a new salary can’t take effect until after the next election.  In 1989, Congress enacted a formula for providing cost of living adjustments to Congress members. But since 2009, the annual salary for most senators has remained at $174,000. Why have salaries stayed the same for a decade? Because the law allows some political theater so members can ""vote against"" a raise. Congress routinely blocks the automatic wage adjustment from taking effect. (The Congressional Research Office published a history of Congressional salaries in this 2020 report.) The 2018 omnibus included the same pay freeze, saying ""no adjustment shall be made under section 601(a) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (2 U.S.C. 4501) (relating to cost of living adjustments for Members of Congress) during fiscal year 2018."" We asked the Tillis campaign why Tillis opposed the omnibus bill. Romeo said it had nothing to do with pay for service members or a pay increase for senators. ""When Congress was presented with a huge spending bill that failed to make any meaningful attempts to get federal spending under control, Senator Tillis voted in favor of cloture to prevent the bill from stalling but voted against the final passage,"" Romeo said. Cloture is a Senate procedure for ending debates on the floor. The VoteVets ad says Tillis voted ""against a pay raise for a military, while voting for a pay raise for himself.""  It’s true that the bill VoteVets referenced included a raise for military service members, and that it froze pay for Congress members. It’s also true that Tillis voted against it. However, VoteVets ignores the broader context of the bill and of Tillis’ record on military pay. Tillis supported military raises in the National Defense Authorization Act. And he says his opposition to the omnibus bill had nothing to do with pay for Congress members. This ad is a classic example of cherry-picking that PolitiFact sees every election, using a single vote to make a misleading point.

Yesterday she said @realdonaldtrump did not appoint minorities to the courts. These are federal judges he nominated in Florida and Kamala did not vote to confirm a single one of them. pic.twitter.com/9arxf22RXb The Florida GOP didn’t accurately quote what Harris said at the debate and omits context about the nominations of the four judges highlighted in the tweet. During the debate, Vice President Mike Pence asked Harris if she and Biden plan to add more seats on the Supreme Court if Trump’s nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed and Biden wins the election. ""Let’s talk about packing the court then,"" Harris replied. She said that she had witnessed lifetime appointments to the federal court who are ""purely ideological people"" who were ""not competent."" ""And do you know that of the 50 people who President Trump appointed to the Court of Appeals for lifetime appointments, not one is Black? This is what they've been doing,"" she said. ""You want to talk about packing a court? Let's have that discussion."" The statement by Harris about no Black appeals court appointments by Trump is accurate, according to data from the Federal Judicial Center, the research and education agency for the nation’s federal courts.   The Florida GOP tweet includes a different class of federal judges, though both are lifetime appointments. The party highlighted three of Trump’s nominees to federal district courts in Florida and one federal appeals court judge who is a Hispanic woman. Federal district courts are below appellate courts. There are 13 appellate courts that sit below the U.S. Supreme Court. These courts hear challenges to district court decisions. Harris was talking about the appeals court, and the Florida GOP portrayed her as a liar at the debate by bringing up the lower court system. Regardless, here’s what happened with the judges pictured in the Florida GOP tweet.  All four nominees pictured in the tweet had worked as judges in Florida, and all were approved by the U.S. Senate in 2019.  Harris voted against confirming Rodney Smith, who is Black. Smith was confirmed 78-18 in June 2019.  Harris didn’t vote on the other three nominees.  Wendy W. Berger, who is white, was confirmed 54-37 largely along party lines in July 2019.  Anuraag Singhal, whose parents emigrated to the U.S. from India, was confirmed 76-17 in December 2019. Barbara Lagoa, who is Hispanic, was confirmed 80-15 in November 2019 for the 11th Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals.  These votes took place in 2019 when Harris was running in the Democratic primary for president.  We asked spokespersons for Harris why she voted against Smith and didn’t vote on the other three and didn’t get a response to that question. We found news articles, blogs and Senate questionnaires that showed all four nominees had been affiliated with the Federalist Society, a national group of conservative lawyers. ""What's behind these disputes is the fact that the administration (and Federalist Society) have emphasized above all putting young ideological conservatives on the courts of appeals. Gender, race, and other factors have been much less important,"" Russell Wheeler of the Brookings Institution said. ""So, no Blacks and only one Latino/a (Lagoa)."" Some Senate Democrats have voted against Trump’s appeals court picks because Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked President Barack Obama’s judicial appointments in 2015 and 2016. RELATED: Fact-check: Why Barack Obama failed to fill over 100 judgeships A spokesperson for the Republican Party of Florida said the tweet was warranted, arguing that Harris implied Trump ""has not made appointments that reflect the diversity of our country.""  ""Most importantly judicial appointments should be decided based on a person’s qualifications and experience, not race, ethnicity or gender,"" said Alia Faraj-Johnson, spokesperson for the Republican Party of Florida.  The Republican Party of Florida said Harris said Trump ""did not appoint minorities to the courts."" The party distorted what Harris said at the debate. Harris accurately said that Trump had not nominated any Black Americans to serve on the federal courts of appeal. The GOP singled out three federal district court nominees who are either minorities or women and one nomination of an Hispanic woman who is an appeals court judge.  It still does not prove that Harris fibbed at the debate. We rate this claim False.

Trump makes unfounded claim that 2016 debate commission apologized for mic
","After refusing to participate in a virtual debate, President Donald Trump continued to wage a war with the Commission on Presidential Debates, saying that the group chooses biased moderators and that it apologized after tampering with his microphone when he debated Hillary Clinton in 2016. In an Oct. 8 phone interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Trump resurfaced his unfounded claim that the commission interfered with his microphone during the 2016 presidential debates, when he faced off against Hillary Clinton, and said the group wrote him an apology letter at the time.  ""Now you have this debate commission is a joke. The commission's a joke,"" Trump told Hannity. ""Take a look at the letter they wrote me four years ago, when they apologized. They were oscillating my mic. They were turning it up and down when I was speaking to Hillary, crooked Hillary."" We found no evidence the commission sent Trump an apology letter in 2016 due to what happened with his mic.  The only letter we find referenced in 2016 news archives involving Trump and the commission is one from the NFL that it denied sending. When we reached out to the Trump campaign and the White House for evidence of this letter, we did not hear back. Trump first raised issues about what he said was a ""defective mic"" during the first general election debate in 2016. He suggested the malfunction may have been deliberate. Later, in 2019, Trump repeated the claim and said the commission was ""forced to publicly apologize."" The commission, a nonprofit that sponsors the presidential debates, did not publicly apologize. It acknowledged in a short, one sentence statement four days after the debate that ""there were issues regarding Donald Trump’s audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall."" The malfunction was confined to the room, and did not affect Trump’s audio for the 84 million people who watched the debate on TV. A contemporaneous report by the New York Times noted that there was ""no evidence of sabotage,"" but said the commission released no other information about the malfunction, including how it was discovered or what equipment was to blame.  PolitiFact contacted the commission about the issue, and asked whether it sent Trump an apology letter. We did not hear back.  In a February 2019 CNN op-ed, two of the three co-chairs for the commission — Frank J. Fahrenkopf, former chairman for the Republican National Committee, and Dorothy S. Ridings,  former journalist and president of the League of Women Voters — wrote that the organization is ""run by an independent board made up of independents, Republicans and Democrats. It receives no party or government funding, and no major party official serves in any capacity with the CPD."" President Trump said that the Commission on Presidential Debates wrote him an apology letter in 2016 over oscillating his microphone during the first general election debate against Hillary Clinton. The organization released a one-sentence statement that noted that there was an issue with Trump’s audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall, but not his audio for Americans who watched the debate on TV. The group was not forced to publicly apologize for the malfunction and we found no evidence that it sent Trump a letter doing so. Trump’s claim is unsubstantiated. We rate it False.",/factchecks/2020/oct/09/donald-trump/trump-makes-unfounded-claim-2016-debate-commission/

No, Trump didn’t tweet his blood is a vaccine
","On Oct. 6, 2020, President Donald Trump tweeted misinformation claiming that COVID-19 is less deadly than the flu.  Twitter hid the tweet so that viewers must click ""view"" to read it. A warning is now also attached: ""This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible."" A post on Facebook shares two images that make it appear that another tweet from Trump was blocked by Twitter. The first shows what looks like a tweet from the president at 3:23 p.m. on Oct. 5. ""My blood IS the vaccine!!!!!"" The second image shows a screenshot of four tweets from Trump and what was a fifth tweet that has been removed. The message says: ""This Tweet is no longer available because it violated the Twitter Rules."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We reached out to Twitter about the post but did not immediately hear back.  Here’s what we know. Trump didn’t tweet that his blood is a vaccine.  The screenshot of Trump’s Twitter feed that shows a message saying a tweet was removed stemmed from a separate tweet from the commander in chief: one posted at 5:54 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time Oct. 5 that included the email address of a New York post reporter, according to the website Trump Twitter Archive. He tweeted the same message again at 7:56 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, only this time he swapped out the reporter’s email for her Twitter handle and @NYPost. As the Twitter account @hoaxeye noted, Trump never tweeted ""my blood is the vaccine,"" according Trump Twitter Archive. The archive shows other tweets that Twitter has flagged — like the one claiming COVID-19 can be less lethal than the flu — but nothing about his blood being a vaccine. We also searched an archive of Trump’s deleted tweets for the word ""vaccine"" on Facba.se but found none.  Searching more broadly online, we also found no news coverage about Trump claiming his blood was a vaccine, or articles about Twitter removing such a tweet. It’s unbelievable that Twitter deleting the tweet that appears in the Facebook post wouldn’t draw wide media attention. News outlets around the world have reported on past instances of the social media platform hiding tweets by the president.  We rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2020/oct/09/viral-image/no-trump-didnt-tweet-his-blood-vaccine/
