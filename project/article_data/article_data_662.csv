Did Rob Portman call the auto bailout a 'lousy deal'?
","Former Democratic Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland didn’t waste any time attacking Republican Sen. Rob Portman for opposing the 2009 automotive bailout and calling it a ""lousy deal."" ""He said the auto rescue was a lousy deal for Ohio,"" Strickland told an audience during his opening statement at the third Senate debate in Cleveland. This isn’t the first time Strickland made this claim. Strickland made the charge in front of some Ohio delegates during a meeting held the week of the Democratic National Convention, according to the Columbus Dispatch. We wondered if Strickland was right. Did Portman call the automotive bailout a ""lousy deal?"" Strickland’s campaign said the remark in question comes from a 2009 statement from Portman, who was a candidate for Senate that year but was not yet in office. The campaign accessed the news release using the Wayback Machine, an Internet Archive website. ""The General Motors bankruptcy plan Washington announced today is a lousy deal for Ohio,"" reads the statement. ""Taxpayers, including hard working Ohioans, are investing $50 billion in a GM plan that we now find includes shutting down plants in Mansfield, Parma, and Columbus, Ohio. The reason for this unprecedented taxpayer bailout and government intervention was to preserve jobs. Instead, for our $50 Billion taxpayer investment, thousands more workers will see their jobs disappear. Ohio deserves better than this."" That’s the only direct reference to ""lousy"" Strickland’s campaign sent PolitiFact Ohio, but they also sent an article from the Columbus Dispatch that quotes Portman’s former spokesperson in 2011 saying Portman still thinks ""the auto bailout was not a good deal for Ohio."" Portman’s campaign told PolitiFact Ohio that although Portman was not in office when the bailout launched, he would have supported the auto rescue. As evidence of this, Portman’s campaign pointed to a 2010 U.S. Senate debate against Democrat Lee Fisher. Portman was asked if he would have supported the 2009 bailout, which Portman responded to with a ""yes,"" while also mentioning he would have liked to see ""more conditions"" in the bailout. ""$50 billion of our taxpayer money went to a private entity that the government essentially took over, and then they closed four plants here in Ohio."" Portman said at the debate. ""So, if I had been in office at the time I would have supported it, but I would have been sure that Ohio didn’t fall behind."" Our ruling Strickland said Portman ""said the auto rescue was a lousy deal for Ohio."" As a candidate for Senate, Portman did call the 2009 automotive bailouts of GM and Chrysler a ""lousy deal"" in a press release from 2009. Strickland cited this remark without including the fact Portman said he still would have supported the bailout. Strickland’s claim is accurate, but needs a slight clarification. We rate Strickland’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/oct/21/ted-strickland/did-rob-portman-call-auto-bailout-lousy-deal/

Rob Portman says FBI director said Syrian refugees can't be adequately vetted
","During a U.S. Senate debate at the City Club of Cleveland, incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman was asked for his views about refugees from Syria and what the U.S. role should be. Portman said that refugees face a dire situation due to actions of the Syrian government, but it would not be wise for the United States to increase the number of refugees admitted. ""Before the Homeland Security Committee, the director of the FBI said that we cannot figure out who these people are, what their intentions are, because we have no information on them, because we don’t have any contact with the Syrian government or any people on the ground to be able to determine that,"" Portman said. ""That to me is not a good thing for the United States to do."" Is that what FBI Director James Comey said? Let’s take a closer look. The United States vets all refugees through an extensive process that involves the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Defense Department and other agencies. The process can take two or even three years, as Democrat Ted Strickland said during the debate. Refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks, and because of special concerns about terrorism, Syrian refugees actually have to go through extra hurdles. Experts have told us repeatedly that refugee background checks are the most extensive security screening the country has for any type of visitor. Comey spoke to the Homeland Security Committees of both chambers of Congress last year, sharing much the same opinion both times. His opinion was not exactly what Portman implied. When Comey spoke before the House Homeland Security Committee on Oct. 21, 2015, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., asked Comey whether there is concern that the FBI could miss a potential terrorist infiltrator because intelligence databases don’t contain complete information for every refugee. Comey said the procedure isn’t perfect. ""We can only query against that which we have collected,"" Comey said. ""If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home but ... there will be nothing show up because we have no record on that person."" So Comey was saying that, despite the thoroughness of the process, he couldn’t guarantee there would never be a problem or that no terrorist would ever slip through the cracks. Comey noted that when the United States performed background checks on Iraqi refugees, they had a much larger database because the United States has had a presence there for more than a decade. Not having the same intelligence infrastructure in Syria has resulted in much less information with which to cross-reference an applicant. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said at the same hearing that it’s possible a refugee could have an unknown criminal past or suddenly commit a terrorist act after entering the United States. That said, despite the pitfalls of admitting refugees from war-torn regions, Comey said the process works and has been improving over the years. ""The good news is we are much better doing it than eight years ago,"" Comey told U.S. Rep Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., later in the hearing. ""The bad news is, there is no risk-free process."" Comey was echoing concerns he voiced to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Oct. 8. ""There is risk associated with bringing anybody in from the outside, but especially from a conflict zone like that,"" he told the Senate committee. ""From the intelligence community's perspective, as I said, I think we've developed an effective way to touch all of our databases and resources to figure out what we know about individuals. … I don't think that's a cumbersome process. My concern there is that there are certain gaps."" He repeated that sentiment to the House Judiciary Committee on Oct. 22. ""We have gotten much better as an intelligence community at joining our efforts and checking our databases in a way that gives us high confidence. If we have a record on somebody, it will surface. That's the good news,"" Comey said. ""The challenge we face with Syria is that we don't have that rich set of data. So even though we've gotten better at querying what we have, we certainly will have less overall. And so as I said to a question earlier, someone only alerts as a result of our searches if we have some record on them. That's the challenge we face with Syria."" We’ll also note that, especially given the extra scrutiny for Syrian refugees, experts have told us it ""makes no operational sense"" for ISIS to take advantage of the refugee program.

""Given how easy it is to send a European extremist to the U.S. via Europe, why would an ISIS guy in Syria wait the three years it takes to get refugee status?"" Anne Speckhard, a counterterrorism expert at Georgetown University, told us previously. Finally, we should note that we’ve looked at claims from Donald Trump before that the United States doesn’t have a system to vet refugees. That more extreme claim is False. Portman’s claim offers more nuance and context. Our ruling Portman said, ""The director of the FBI said that we cannot figure out who (Syrian refugees) are, what their intentions are, because we have no information on them, because we don’t have any contact with the Syrian government or any people on the ground to be able to determine that."" Portman had a point that Comey expressed concerns about information gaps on potential Syrian refugees. However, he exaggerated the extent of Comey’s concerns when he said that Comey indicated that ""we cannot figure out"" who they are, and that we have ""no information on them."" All told, Comey said the vetting process is thorough, but imperfect. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2016/oct/21/rob-portman/portman-refugees-safely-back-grounded/

Ted Strickland revives 'Baby Doc' lobbyist attack against Rob Portman in Cleveland debate
","Former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland tied Sen. Rob Portman to the notorious former president of Haiti, Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier, during the final Ohio Senate debate. ""There's only one of the two of us standing before this audience that's ever been a registered lobbyist, and that's you, senator,"" Strickland said. ""Your first job as a lobbyist was with the Chinese-based firm. You were a registered foreign agent, and your client was Haiti, at a time when the Baby Doc, Duvalier, who was a despot, was killing people."" Strickland’s charge is a mixed bag of accuracy. After losing his re-election bid to Republican Gov. John Kasich, Strickland oversaw the lobbying and activism arm of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, but he was not a lobbyist himself. There’s no doubt that Portman, however, was a registered foreign agent, a title that can involve lobbying. As PolitiFact Ohio has previously reported, Portman started working with the law firm Patton, Boggs & Blow after graduating from University of Michigan's law school in 1984. The Strickland campaign sent us a Buzzfeed article showing Portman’s 1985 foreign agent registration form. He was listed as a foreign agent on behalf of the Republic of Haiti, which was ruled by Duvalier at the time. Duvalier, who inherited the ""president for life"" post from his father, ""Papa Doc,"" headed what human rights workers called one of the most oppressive governments in the Western Hemisphere, according to the New York Times. His regime, known for the murder and torture of of tens of thousands, was toppled in 1986.   But it’s not entirely fair to imply that Portman was Duvalier’s lackey. He never lobbied on behalf of Haiti or any other foreign government. In 2005, Portman was named by President George W. Bush as his U.S. Trade Representative, a position that can’t be held by anyone who’s ever lobbied for foreign governments. Being tapped for the position prompted an affidavit from Stuart Pape, a former managing partner of Portman's law firm dated April 12, 2005. Pape said Portman filed the foreign agent registration form because he was working for the Hong Kong-based Duty Free Shoppers, Ltd., the ""Chinese-based firm"" Strickland referred to. But Pape said he reviewed the records and confirmed that Portman did no work for Haiti or any foreign government. On Portman’s campaign website, the Haiti registration is explained as ""standard procedure"" at the lobbying firm, and required of all of its attorneys. The firm, the record shows, did travel to Haiti to meet with Baby Doc. Our ruling Strickland said of Portman, ""You were a registered foreign agent, and your client was Haiti, at a time when the Baby Doc, Duvalier, who was a despot, was killing people."" Portman was a registered foreign agent who worked on behalf of a company based in Hong Kong. His firm’s clients included ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier’s government. But Portman himself did no work for the Haitian regime, according to a sworn statement by the firm’s managing partner. We rate Strickland's statement Mostly False. Correction: The original version of this fact-check incorrectly called Rob Portman a registered lobbyist. He was a registered foreign agent, a classification that included lobbying under the law at that time.",/factchecks/2016/oct/21/ted-strickland/ted-strickland-revives-baby-doc-attack-against-por/

Trump says Russia has added nuclear warheads, while US hasn't
","Donald Trump says Russian President Vladimir Putin has no respect for Hillary Clinton, as evidenced by advancements in Russia’s nuclear program. At the final presidential debate Oct. 19, Clinton said Trump’s supposed Russian sympathies would turn him into Putin’s ""puppet"" in the White House. Trump shot back at Clinton: ""You’re the puppet!"" ""(Putin) has no respect for her,"" Trump said. ""He has no respect for our president. And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads — 1,800, by the way — where they expanded, and we didn't. 1,800 nuclear warheads. And she's playing chicken."" We decided to take a look at Trump’s claim that Russia has 1,800 nuclear warheads, expanding their arsenal while the United States did not. We found that Trump’s 1,800 figure refers to deployed strategic nuclear warheads, meaning long-range nuclear weapons that are out in the field rather than in storage or retired. Trump is correct that Russia has slightly increased its deployed strategic nuclear warhead count over the past five years while the United States has not. However, Trump overstates the significance of this growth in Russian deployed nuclear warheads, and his claim omits the fact that Russia and the United States are estimated to have about the same number of nuclear warheads when non-deployed stockpiles are included. By the numbers New START, an agreement between Russia and the United States designed to limit both countries’ deployed strategic nuclear weapons, went into force in February 2011. Since then, the State Department has published select data about both countries’ arsenals twice a year. This is the source of Trump’s claim. Russia began New START with 1,537 deployed strategic nuclear warheads in February 2011. As of Oct. 1, 2016, it has 1,796. The United States, conversely, has gone from 1,800 deployed nuclear warheads to 1,367 in the same time frame. At first glance, this might seem like Russia is building up its deployed nuclear arsenal. But experts told us that this spike is actually a result of Russia modernizing its nuclear program. Essentially, Russia is in the process of replacing old missile launchers and submarines with new ones that can hold more warheads per vehicle. But they haven’t yet retired all the old vehicles, so the deployed warhead count temporarily reflects the doubling up of new and old launchers currently deployed. ""That increase is not a sign of an expanding arsenal but a temporary fluctuation caused by newer launchers replacing older launchers,"" said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, adding that he expects Russia to complete this process by 2018, when it has to fully meet New START limits. Trump didn't say this at the debate, but the United States is also in the process of modernizing its nuclear arsenal, spending about $35 billion a year on the project. Kristensen said that at any given time, the New START numbers can fluctuate by a few hundred warheads as launchers go in and out of service, and it does not cause concern among the U.S. military and intelligence community. He cited a 2012 Defense Department report that concluded Russia ""would not be able to achieve a militarily significant advantage by any plausible expansion of its strategic nuclear forces, even in a cheating or breakout scenario under the New START Treaty.""   The number of deployed strategic warheads is a significant figure because it refers to warheads that could, potentially, target the United States or other long-range adversaries of Russia. But in citing this 1,800 figure, Trump leaves out how many non-deployed warheads the two countries have in their reserves. As of May 2016, Russia has 4,490 nuclear warheads deployed and in reserve, and the United States has about the same at 4,500, according to Federation of American Scientists estimates. Both countries have steadily reduced their nuclear stockpiles since the 1990s, when Russia and the United States had a combined 60,000 warheads. In the past decade or so, however, the decline has nearly stagnated for both countries. Over the same five-year period during which Russia added 259 deployed warheads, reaching Trump’s approximately 1,800 total, its total warhead stockpile, deployed and reserves combined, shrunk by 368. So Trump’s number, while accurate in isolation, misses the big picture: Russia and the United States have reached a point, through mutual drawbacks, where their nuclear stockpiles are about equivalent, according to the best estimates available. Our ruling Trump said Russia has ""tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads — 1,800, by the way — where they expanded, and we didn't."" Between 2011 and 2016, Russia has expanded its deployed strategic nuclear warheads from 1,537 to 1,796, while the United States decreased its deployed strategic nuclear warheads over the same period. But that statistic ignores that Russia’s total number of warheads, deployed and in its reserves, is about the same as the United States’. Both have about 4,500 nuclear warheads in their total stockpiles. And experts said the recent spike in Russia’s deployed weapons is temporary, rather than indicative of an upward trend.

Portman, Strickland duel over who's richer
","There were times during the second debate between Sen. Rob Portman and former Gov. Ted Strickland in which the two politicians quibbled over who’s richer. The feuding over fat wallets emerged in the first debate when Strickland announced that he’d calculated Portman’s hourly earnings at $333.57, after factoring in assets and his $174,000 salary as a U.S. senator. Strickland, a Democrat, juxtaposed the dollar figure with Portman’s stance against raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. Portman didn’t dispute the figure, but in the second matchup between the candidates, he hit back with a calculation of his own. ""(Strickland) went to Washington, D.C., and he became a lobbyist,"" Portman said. ""He made $400,000 a year. So he wasn’t living on minimum wage, but he was working against the interests of Ohioans, including the people he used to represent."" Strickland sounded surprised, responding, ""The senator said I made $400,000. My ... oh, senator, that’s a big whopper. I’ve never made $400,000 in my life."" We decided to take a look at Strickland’s earnings. Was he really a lobbyist pulling in $400,000? There are some issues with Portman’s attack. But he isn’t far off with Strickland’s post-Congress earnings, if you’re willing to include a variety of compensation into the picture. The first issue with Portman’s claim: Strickland was never a registered lobbyist. After losing his re-election bid to Gov. John Kasich, Strickland took a job with the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. An amended 2015 financial disclosure filing shows that Strickland earned $199,125 between April 2014 to March 2015. Strickland headed up the political action fund for the think tank. His position is listed as ""director/counselor"" on the group’s tax forms. So technically, he was not a lobbyist himself, but he oversaw the group’s lobbying arm. When asked why Portman called Strickland a lobbyist, campaign spokesperson Michawn Rich said, ""He did not misspeak. Ted ran the lobbying arm of the Center for American Progress. It's a fact."" The second problem is that the earnings in question are not as straightforward as a $400,000 salary. You reach that amount by counting income from various jobs and retirement funds. The Center for American Progress Action Fund reports on its 2014 IRS Form 990 that Strickland earned ""other compensation"" in the amount of $13,623. The 990 form reports compensation over nine months, and Strickland was there for a year. So if you divide $13,623 by nine, monthly compensation comes to $1,513. Accounting for a year’s time in that position, Strickland would have made about $18,164 in addition to the reported $199,125 income. Strickland also disclosed $20,000 in earnings from consulting at the Bipartisan Policy Center, and $25,000 from working as a mediator with the Washington law firm Taft, Stettinius & Hollister. He reported $36,700 from his state retirement, and $25,500 from a PNC Bank-administered IRA fund. Strickland is also earning a federal pension from his 12 years in Congress, which is calculated by taking an average of the three-highest salaried years in Congress, multiplying the average by 1.7 percent, and multiplying the result by years of congressional service. Strickland’s three highest-earning years in office would have been 2004, 2005, and 2006, so the average comes to $161,800. Strickland was in Congress for 12 years, and 12 x 1.7 percent equals 20.4 percent. We will estimate Strickland’s pension, then, to be about $33,000 a year. (No more math after this, okay?) David Bergstein, spokesperson for Strickland’s campaign, disagrees that retirement earnings should be included as part of Strickland’s earnings in Washington.   Subtracting the IRA and retirement fund, Strickland’s total annual earnings from a few gigs would be $295,289 — or $141.97 an hour. Our ruling Portman said Strickland ""went to Washington, D.C., and he became a lobbyist. He made $400,000 a year."" Technically Strickland wasn’t a lobbyist; he oversaw a liberal think tank’s lobbying and activism arm. As for his income, if you add his disclosed earnings, figures from public IRS forms and retirement income, you get an estimate around $357,000. Not everyone would tally up annual wealth this way. Portman’s statement is partially accurate but a bit sloppy in the details, so we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2016/oct/20/rob-portman/portman-strickland-duel-over-whos-richer/
"['Nevada', 'Voting Record', 'Catherine Cortez Masto']","
Catherine Cortez Masto claims Joe Heck supported the 2013 government shutdown
","In the first and likely last Nevada U.S. Senate debate, Democratic candidate Catherine Cortez Masto accused her opponent, Republican Joe Heck, of supporting the 2013 government shutdown. While answering if they’ll pledge to never shut down the federal government, Cortez Masto quickly accused Heck of saying one thing on stage and doing another in office. ""Congressman Heck’s already done it,"" she said as both candidates raised their hands. ""He voted to shut down the government and continued with the sequestration, so I don’t know why he’s raising his hand."" The former Democratic attorney general continued to hammer the same point (her campaign said she mistakenly said ""sequestration"" instead of shutdown) throughout the hour-long debate, which Heck fervently denied. And at least one outside group has made the same claim in a television ad. Heck was initially on the side of House Republicans who led the budget standoff, but the 16-day shutdown and various votes are all more complex than Cortez Masto implies. Government shutdown Cortez Masto was referring to the October 2013 two-week budget stalemate between congressional Republicans and President Barack Obama over funding for the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans at the time attempted to use legislation meant to finance the government as leverage to roll back portions of the 2013 health care law, with Senate Democrats and the president dismissed as dangerous political maneuvring. During the deadlock, many governmental services were placed on hold, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees were furloughed or asked to work without pay. The stalemate finally ended two weeks later, with Republicans backing down to avoid the government defaulting on its debts. Heck, first elected to Congress in 2010, was in office through the shutdown. Cortez Masto’s campaign cited a Sept. 30, 2013, vote as the vote to shut down the government, and claims that Heck and House Republicans then voted 16 times against efforts to reopen the government. Meanwhile, Heck’s campaign is adamant that he voted for every bill to fund the government that came to the House floor, including the final bill that ended the shutdown. (A frustrated Heck said multiple times in the debate that there was ""never a vote to shut down the government."") So which candidate is right? It’s true that Heck did join with the majority of House Republicans in supporting government spending bills widely viewed at the time of having no chance of passing because they defunded or delays portions of the Affordable Care Act. Polls taken immediately after the shutdown indicated that voters blamed Republicans more than the president over the standoff. Cortez Masto’s campaign said she was referring to a Sept. 30 vote on a motion to ""recede and concur,"" as the measure to ""shut down the government,"" which had the practical effect of funding the government until December and delaying some requirements in the new health care law for a year. Heck joined a majority of Republicans in voting for the continuing resolution despite the well-publicized threat of a presidential veto, and said in a statement that the House vote reflected what the American people wanted. Cortez Masto campaign spokesman Zach Hudson said the vote essentially equates to voting to shut down the government, as it came on the last day before the shutdown would begin and in the face of Democrats flatly rejecting any spending bill with health care law riders attached. ""Congress has one key duty in the Constitution: pass spending bills that fund the government,"" Hudson said in an email. ""Clearly, Republicans cared more about defunding the Affordable Care Act than keeping the government open."" Cortez Masto’s campaign sent us a list of 16 votes taken by Heck during the shutdown, all of which were successful Republican votes to table, or kill, Democratic procedural motions to bring the clean spending bill up for a vote. That doesn’t necessarily equate to a vote prolonging the standoff — all the votes cited would have only given Democrats the opportunity to bring a clean spending bill to the floor for an up-or-down vote. Heck never outright said whether or not he’d support a hypothetical clean funding bill, but after 16 days of the shutdown, the Senate approved a bipartisan ""clean"" spending bill funding the government through January 2014 on an 81-18 margin. Heck and 86 other House Republicans then voted with Democrats to approve the spending bill, which was promptly signed by the president. In a statement after the vote, Heck said he was ""deeply disappointed"" that spending changes weren’t addressed but that ""government by crisis is not an effective way to govern."" The Las Vegas Sun characterized his actions as a ""classic Heck move,"" detailing multiple times where he ""held the party line"" until the last minute and ended up voting for a compromise final deal. But Heck was right in that there was never any up-or-down vote on some sort of a ""government shut-down bill,"" and all of the measures Heck voted on would have funded the federal government. Heck’s campaign also sent PolitiFact a list of 15 other bills that either funded the government entirely with health care riders attached, or funded individual agencies in a piecemeal manner. Senate Democrats rejected those measures entirely, saying they would only accept a ""clean"" funding bill. Heck campaign spokesman Brian Baulta said those votes backed up the candidate’s assertion during the debate that he voted for ""every piece of legislation"" to open the government back up. ""At the end of the day, Dr. Heck voted for the non-procedural bills to keep the government open, voted for the bills to fund important government programs, and voted for the final bill to re-open the government,"" Baluta said in an email. ""Dr. Heck preferred negotiating versus the type of brinksmanship and refusal to compromise that led to the shutdown."" PolitiFact previously gave Florida Sen. Marco Rubio a Mostly False rating for saying that he was ""never in favor of shutting down the government,"" but Republican senators in the minority at the time ended up voting against ""clean"" funding bills to maintain the shutdown. Rubio also voted against the final funding bill that ended the shutdown, which Heck voted for. Our ruling Cortez Masto claimed that Heck ""voted to shut down the government."" Heck did vote for many pieces of legislation that technically would have funded the government, but the political reality was that all of those proposals were doomed to fail because they sought to undo at least part of the Affordable Care Act. Heck was cagey on his support for a ""clean"" spending bill throughout the shutdown, but did break from the majority of his party and joined with Democrats in voting for the spending bill that ended the shutdown. Because Cortez Masto is oversimplifying the issue and how Heck voted, we rate her statement as Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/373aadb6-21d8-45b1-bf07-a44bc13a55f9",/factchecks/2016/oct/20/catherine-cortez-masto/catherine-cortez-masto-claims-joe-heck-supported-2/

What Hillary Clinton's plans mean for the U.S. debt
","At the third and final presidential debate, moderator Chris Wallace said both candidates are ignoring concerns about the rising national debt. ""The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years,"" Wallace said Oct. 19, 2016. ""Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. Question is -- why are both of you ignoring this problem?"" Trump said the basis of the question was wrong because he will ""create tremendous jobs."" Clinton, meanwhile, said she pays for everything she proposes, primarily by increasing taxes for the wealthiest Americans. ""What I have put forward does not add a penny to the debt,"" Clinton said. Is that right? Yes and no. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan policy group, says Clinton’s plans would increase the debt by a relatively small amount, $200 billion over a decade ""above current law levels."" The Clinton campaign says a new business tax plan would generate an additional $275 billion to cancel out that debt increase. However the numbers shake out, the debt would still grow by $9 trillion over 10 years because of interest payments related to the U.S. debt and projected spending on Social Security and Medicare. ""Interest on the debt will become the fastest growing part of federal spending. In 2017, the next president will inherit a government projected to spend over $300 billion on interest payments that year alone, an amount that grows to more than $800 billion by 2025 — more than the current combined federal spending on the Defense Department, education, transportation, and medical research,"" wrote Bob Bixby and Maya MacGuineas for the Brookings Institution. So, as Wallace said, without further changes, debt would rise to above 86 percent of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product under Clinton’s plan. For the record, Wallace was also correct that the debt would grow faster if Trump is elected, according to independent researchers. Here’s a chart spelling it out from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.  ""We are encouraged that Clinton continues to largely pay for her new spending and that Trump has made substantial improvements to his plan, including a less costly tax plan and new spending cuts,"" the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote. ""Unfortunately, neither candidate has presented a proposal to address our growing national debt and put it on a more sustainable path, nor have they offered a proposal for shoring up the Social Security, Medicare, or Highway trust funds. As it currently stands, Donald Trump’s proposals would still substantially worsen the debt."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""What I have put forward does not add a penny to the debt."" An independent analysis found Clinton’s proposals would add a relatively small amount to the debt, $200 billion over a decade. The Clinton campaign says a new business tax plan will address that, though the proposal hasn’t been independently analyzed. Regardless, Clinton’s explanation leaves out the fact that debt would still rise by about $9 trillion over 10 years because of current policies. Clinton’s proposals don’t stem that increase. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/30d13ea3-9259-4377-a2ff-ce6ecb7fb0c3 Update (Oct. 24, 2016): This article has been updated to reflect that one of the reasons the debt will increase is because of  projected spending on Social Security and Medicare.",/factchecks/2016/oct/20/hillary-clinton/what-hillary-clintons-plans-mean-us-debt/

Progress Texas makes speculative claim about Donald Trump firing 49,000 Texas teachers
","Sometimes Donald Trump says that if elected president, he’ll eliminate the federal Department of Education. However, that goal wasn’t part of the education plan he laid out last month. So we were curious when Progress Texas, a liberal-leaning education and advocacy group, attributed dire consequences to Trump’s education plan. The group opened a Sept. 20, 2016, blog post: ""He doesn't always talk about policy, but when he does -- it's also terrible. Donald Trump's education plan to dramatically slash funding for public education would fire 49,000 Texas teachers."" Trump’s plan So, what does Trump want to do? For our part, we confirmed instances of the Republican presidential nominee saying he could shutter or shrink the 4,400-employee, $68 billion education department. The agency, founded in 1980, says it focuses on distributing federal aid, collecting student performance data and ensuring equal access to schools. In Texas of late, federal aid of late covers more than 10 percent of school spending. On Fox News Sunday in October 2015, Trump was asked if he would cut agencies. Trump replied that he favors ""local education"" and that ""I may cut Department of Education."" In April 2016 on Fox News’ Hannity, the candidate called the department ""massive, and it can be largely eliminated."" But Trump also said, ""you maybe want to have a little bit of tentacles out there."" Then again, Trump’s formal education initiatives, unveiled in September 2016, don’t mention shrinking or eliminating the department, stressing instead his vow to enable children to attend the public, charter or private school of their choice starting by reprioritizing $20 billion in federal funds. Trump didn’t say where the funds would come from; an Education Week news story on his plan said ""it's possible he was referring to Title I money for disadvantaged students, funded at about $15.5 billion right now."" Also not in the posted plan: Any statement about cutting teachers in any state including Texas, which has more than 320,000 teachers. Texas group cites speculative study When we asked Progress Texas how the group reached its count of 49,000 potentially doomed teachers, Phillip Martin replied by email that the group relied on a report from the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning Washington-based think tank. Worth noting: The report, which came out Sept. 1, 2016--before Trump laid out his education platform--draws from Trump the month before telling a reporter for Circa, a video-centric news service, that ""we're going to be cutting the Department of Education big league."" Circa's story didn’t quote Trump talking about teachers. But the center’s report states: ""To calculate the number of teachers who could potentially lose their job as a result of Trump’s proposal, the author added the most recent average teacher salary by state figures from the National Center for Education Statistics to the representative statistic of costs associated with education and health-services occupations from the Department of Labor. Subsequently, the author divided the total dollar amount each state receives for elementary and secondary education from the Department of Education by the above sum,"" it says. We clicked through to an education department presentation of state-by-state aid, finding that for fiscal 2016, Texas school districts would receive $3,228,065,364 across 19 program elementary and secondary education categories topped by $1.3 billion in grants to local educational agencies. By phone, the center’s Will Ragland told us the center sought to show what the potential impact would be if all Department of Education funds disappeared; the center reached its figure of 49,045 teachers for Texas by assuming the cut funds would play out entirely in lost teaching jobs--a calculation that we confirmed. ""His plan wasn’t very specific,"" Ragland said. Nationally, federal funds cover about 8 percent of school district budgets and such aid flows to specific programs, such as to benefit low-income students, students with disabilities, computer science programs or early childhood education, according to the Department of Education website. Experts say it's speculation Experts we asked about the center’s teachers-vamoosed conclusion saw flaws. By phone, Lori Taylor, a Texas A&M University associate professor, told us that 70 percent of more than $3 billion in federal education funds spent in Texas in 2014-15 went to payroll. But, Taylor noted, that spending could include all positions, ranging from administrative assistants to speech therapists to teachers. In contract, to get to the center’s 49,000 teacher count, Taylor said, you have to inaccurately assume that 100 percent of federal revenues are spent on teacher payrolls--plus that every penny of it would be eliminated under Trump’s plan. Taylor added that even if Trump moved to shutter the department, it’s unlikely the government would eliminate funding for popular programs that serve low-income children or students with disabilities. ""It’s not politically possible,"" she said by phone. ""I believe the estimates are overblown,"" she said. For out-of-state perspective, we reached Kevin Welner, director of the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado. Welner told us by email he doesn’t ""fault the authors of that report for trying to come up with estimates like this, but it’s very important to stress that, in doing so, these authors are not just adding flesh to a skeletal proposal – they necessarily have to add most of the bones."" ""To my knowledge,"" Welner said, ""Trump hasn’t provided any specifics at all concerning what he would actually ‘shred’ in the realm of Department of Education programs... So the report authors had to speculate, which means it’s speculative to conclude that the plan ‘would fire 49,000 Texas teachers.’"" Our ruling Progress Texas said Donald Trump’s plan would ""fire"" 49,000 Texas teachers. This claim rests on Trump diverting a great deal of federal aid--something Trump hasn't said he'll do, far as we can tell. Trump has said he wants to shrink the Department of Education toward more local control. However, he’s offered no specifics on what that would entail. Notably too, the education plan Trump rolled out before this claim surfaced doesn’t mention the agency or intentions of cutting teachers. We find this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

Some of Teachout's donors also gave to super PACs
","Zephyr Teachout has been a vocal opponent of super PACs. For a short time last year the Democrat even headed a super PAC whose goal was to end all super PACs. But the National Republican Congressional Committee said that hasn’t stopped her from accepting contributions from those who gave to Super PACs.   ""Zephyr Teachout says she is against Super PACs despite taking money from Super PAC donors,"" the NRCC wrote in a blog post. Getting big money out of politics has been a central theme of her campaign to represent the 19th Congressional District, located in New York State’s Hudson Valley and Catskills regions, like it was when she ran for governor in 2014. Super PACs are able to accept and spend unlimited amounts of money in elections. Is the National Republican Congressional Committee right? Has her campaign accepted money from super PAC donors? Teachout’s donors The National Republican Congressional Committee names 16 people it says donated to Teachout’s campaign and to super PACs. We found the donors in Teachout’s campaign finance filings. Altogether, the 16 donors have given $67,300 to Teachout. That’s about 2 percent of the $3.2 million she has raised, according to her latest filing. The 16 Teachout contributors who gave money to super PACs contributed at least $61 million to super PACs. Two donated $10,000 or less to super PACs. In 2016, seven of the donors gave to super PACs. The other nine did not. Among the 16 donors are billionaire George Soros and members of his family. Super PAC support Teachout has received backing from one super PAC: National Nurses United. It reported spending almost $47,000 in digital ad buys for the Democrat this year. Teachout's campaign says Faso has received more help from super PACs. New York Wins reported spending close to $1 million in ads and mailers against his primary opponent. The group has not reported spending anything against Teachout. Another super PAC, Congressional Leadership Fund, spent more than $2.7 million against Teachout in mail and media placement since the June primary.

Donald Trump says reports of sexual assault by him have been disproven
","Republican nominee Donald Trump said at the third and final presidential debate that allegations from nine women that he groped or kissed them without their consent have been debunked. ""Nobody has more respect for women than I do — nobody,"" Trump said. ""And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked."" Have they? We decided to look into Trump’s claim. What we found is that while some accounts have been challenged, none have been shown to be untrue by any objective measure. We’ll discuss the situation surrounding each accuser. Jessica Leeds Leeds told the New York Times that in the 1980s, Trump groped her during an airplane flight to New York. According to the New York Times, Leeds ""told the story to at least four people close to her, who also spoke with The New York Times."" The Trump campaign offered a contrary account from a man who said he was on that flight. Anthony Gilberthorpe told the New York Post that Leeds was the one who was being flirtatious and that he saw nothing inappropriate. Gilberthorpe has a checkered past involving his revelation that he procured young boys for high-ranking British politicians, but more importantly, he told the Post he has no evidence to support his story. Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson challenged Leeds’ story on the grounds that the airplane Pierson said Leeds flew in didn’t have armrests as Leed’s described. No one knows what sort of plane Leeds was in. For the most part, it’s word against word. Mindy McGillivray McGillivray told the Palm Beach Post that in 2003, Trump grabbed her behind at a Mar-a-Lago concert. McGillivray was assisting photographer Ken Davidoff. Davidoff told the Post reporter he ""vividly remembers when McGillivray pulled him aside moments after the alleged incident and told him, ‘Donald just grabbed my ass!’ "" The counter information comes from the conservative website thegatewaypundit, which claims that there was no concert on the day Davidoff said. But the website asserts that without proof. Even if the photographer got the date wrong, and there’s no proof that he did, that doesn’t debunk the allegation. Natasha Stoynoff Stoynoff wrote in People magazine that during a pause in a 2005 interview with Trump and his wife Melania, Trump and she were alone in a room briefly where he forcibly kissed her. She told a co-worker, friends and family soon after the event happened but did not include it in her article. The counter information comes from Trump’s former butler Anthony Senecal who told the Palm Beach Post that ""it never happened.""  Melania Trump also disputes later meeting Stoynoff on the street as Stoynoff said. Again, we have the confirmation of Stoynoff’s friends, and at most, it’s her word against Senecal’s. Summer Zervos Zervos was a former contestant on Trump’s reality show The Apprentice. She said she went to Trump’s golf course in Palos Verdes, Calif., in 2007 to apply for a job and Trump forcibly kissed her and groped her. In a news conference, a social worker said that Zervos told her about the encounter in 2010, years before Trump announced his presidential bid. Trump posted on Facebook that he never met Zervos at a hotel and that she stayed in touch with him. Trump wrote that as recently as April this year, she invited him to come to her restaurant in California. Also, Zervos’cousin said she only had good things to say about Trump. Trump’s account raises questions about Zervos’ contact with him, but it does not rebut her claim. Claims from other women There are five other women who say that Trump groped or kissed them without their consent. They are Cassandra Searles, Rachel Crooks, Kristen Anderson, Jill Harth and Temple Taggert McDowell. We found no evidence to undermine their claims other than Trump’s own denials. We asked the Trump campaign to send us details that would disprove the women’s accounts and did not hear back. Our ruling Trump said that the stories of him groping or forcing himself on women ""have been largely debunked."" His campaign offered no evidence of that. We found that five of the nine stories have not been independently disputed. Of the remaining four stories, the women told friends, family or colleagues at the time, which provides some support. On the flip side, there is the account of Trump’s former butler and a man who acknowledges that he has no proof of his version of events. While some of the women’s stories have been questioned, not one has been conclusively debunked, and the majority of the stories haven’t been challenged by any facts other than Trump’s denials.

Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump claimed the Emmys were rigged
","Hillary Clinton says that Donald Trump’s favorite defense line if he’s losing is to claim the process is rigged. He’s made the accusation several times so far during the 2016 presidential election. But he also said it when his reality TV show The Apprentice didn’t win an Emmy in 2012, 2013 or 2014. ""There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged,"" Clinton said Oct. 19 at the third and final presidential debate. We decided to examine Trump’s Twitter feed to see what he had to say. In the case of the Emmys, Trump clearly does a lot of whining about not winning. April 29, 2013: ""I should have many Emmys for The Apprentice if the process were fair-in any event, it's not my day job."" Sept. 24, 2012: "" 'Amazing Race' winning an Emmy again is a total joke. The Emmys have no credibility -- no wonder the ratings are at record lows."" Sept. 22, 2013: ""The Emmys are soooooo boring! Terrible show. I'm going to watch football! I already know the winners. Good night."" March 2, 2014: ""Which is worse and which is more dishonest - the #Oscars or the Emmys?"" Sept. 24, 2012: ""The Emmys are all politics, that's why, despite nominations, The Apprentice never won--even though it should have many times over."" Jan. 14, 2013: ""According to many, and while nominated, I would have won the Emmy many times except for my politics. @PrimetimeEmmys."" Sept. 22, 2013:  ""#CelebApprentice should be part of the Emmys nominations! Pure politics!"" That’s a lot of angst. But Trump never directly says the Emmys process is rigged in the way he has characterized the U.S. election system. In most cases, Trump is complaining that politics plays a role in deciding who wins, which is not a particularly surprising assertion when it comes to the selections made by award shows, or by voters trying to decide whom to pick for United States president for that matter. Our ruling Clinton said, ""There was even a time when (Donald Trump) didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged."" Trump never directly makes that accusation. He calls the system unfair and political, but he doesn’t go as far as to allege that the process is being rigged or tampered.

Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton is 'wrong' to say he mocked a disabled reporter
","Once again, a comment by Donald Trump has become a point of contention in a presidential debate. This time, it revolved around remarks Trump made almost a year ago about a disabled reporter. At one point in the third presidential debate in Las Vegas, Hillary Clinton said, ""He also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television."" Trump interrupted, ""Wrong."" So who’s right? Here’s the background, which we have looked at before. At at a campaign rally in South Carolina on Nov. 24, 2015, Trump referred to New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski. At the time, Trump was taking heat for his widely debunked claims that he watched in Jersey City, N.J., as  ""thousands and thousands of people were cheering"" the collapse of the World Trade Center following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. To defend this account, Trump cited a Sept. 18, 2001, story co-written by Kovaleski, who was a Washington Post reporter at the time. Near the bottom of the story, the Post reporters wrote that ""law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river."" However, the reporters couldn’t verify the celebrations actually occurred, as Kovaleski later explained. ""I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating. That was not the case, as best as I can remember,"" Kovaleski told the Washington Post Fact Checker in November 2015. Remember, Kovaleski wrote that ""a number of people"" -- not thousands -- were allegedly seen celebrating. At the rally where he discussed Kovaleski, Trump said, ""You gotta see this guy"" and wildly flailed his arms, his right hand flopping at an odd angle as he shouted in a weird, agitated voice: ""Ahh, I don’t know what I said! Ahh, I don’t remember!"" Kovaleski has arthrogryposis, a congenital condition which limits the movement of his joints and has left his right hand sharply angled at the wrist. Kovaleski speaks with a normal voice and doesn't wave his arms around. (Watch a video of him talking about his ground-breaking reporting on the murder cases against former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez.) Many observers took Trump’s comments and motions as mocking Kovaleski. The New York Times rebuked Trump in a statement: ""We think it's outrageous that he would ridicule the appearance of one of our reporters."" And people who share Kovaleski’s condition -- formally known as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, or AMC -- and their families launched a social media campaign with the hashtag ""AMCStrong."" Julie Reiskin, executive director of the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, an advocacy group, said that Trump ""clearly was mocking his disability. That was very, very obvious, because he disagrees with all kinds of people at other times, and he doesn't use that voice or wave his arms like that."" (Reiskin said she was giving her view since her nonprofit group can't endorse or oppose candidates.) Reiskin said such behavior by Trump ""portrays people with disabilities as incompetent. That if you can't control your speech or part of your body that you're not competent, which is very destructive"" to the image of disabled people facing stereotypes and discrimination, she added. But Trump denied it. He tweeted, ""Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!"" He also said in a statement at the time, ""I merely mimicked what I thought would be a flustered reporter trying to get out of a statement he made long ago."" Trump insisted that he couldn’t have known the man was disabled because ""I have no idea who this reporter, Serge Kovaleski is, what he looks like or his level of intelligence. … Despite having one of the all-time great memories I certainly do not remember him."" Kovaleski countered that as a reporter for the New York Daily News in the late 1980s and early 1990s he regularly covered Trump. He told the Washington Post he was sure the businessman remembered him -- and his condition. ""Donald and I were on a first-name basis for years,"" Kovaleski told the New York Times. In fact, Kovaleski recalled spending the day with Trump in 1989 when the reporter and other journalists flew with the billionaire on the ""inaugural voyage"" of the Trump Shuttle airline. In addition, Trump spoke familiarly about Kovaleski at the rally, calling him a ""nice reporter."" He also described him as ""the poor guy"" and indicated he knew Kovaleski’s appearance (""you gotta see this guy"") before launching into his imitation. After our fact-check appeared, the Washington Post Fact Checker reviewed both Trump’s original comments and subsequent ones he made on the same subject in Colorado. The Fact Checker concluded that ""Trump clearly mocked Kovaleski"" and it gave Trump its lowest rating, Four Pinocchios. In the meantime, some Trump supporters have shared other examples in which Trump has shaken his hands and used an odd tone of voice to refer to other people. In one video, Trump is shown referring to one of his primary rivals, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, with flailing arms and an exaggerated voice. (See it here.) In another, he uses similar, if more subdued, motions when referring to an unnamed general. (See it here.) However, neither of these examples support Trump’s denial in the debate. In the videos, Trump was clearly mocking both Cruz and the unnamed general. In fact, the video about the general -- produced by a Trump supporter -- says explicitly that he was mocking the general. In other words, the most you could say about these bits of evidence is that they demonstrate that Trump is an equal-opportunity mocker. They don’t help refute Clinton’s charge that Trump mocked Kovaleski. The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry after the debate. Our ruling Trump said that Clinton is ""wrong"" to say he mocked a disabled reporter. Trump may deny that he intentionally mocked Kovaleski for his disability, but many Americans believe his remarks amounted to mocking, and we concur that that’s a reasonable -- indeed, perhaps the only -- interpretation of his actions. The notion that Trump’s comments about Cruz and a general undercut Clinton’s claim don’t hold water, because all three examples constitute mocking, whether a disability was involved or not.

Hillary Clinton: Donald Trump still promising to deport every undocumented person
","Immigration was one of the main topics during the final debate between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican contender Donald Trump. Asked about their positions, Trump reaffirmed his plans to build a wall along the southern border, get ""bad hombres"" out of the country and not give ""amnesty."" Clinton said she doesn’t want to rip families apart or ""see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country."" As evidence, Clinton said that Trump ""said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation."" We wondered if in fact Trump said all undocumented people would be subject to deportation. Clinton’s campaign pointed to Trump’s immigration speech on Aug. 31 in Phoenix. In that 10-point speech, Trump started by talking about criminals, saying there would be ""zero tolerance for criminal aliens."" He said his administration would begin moving them out ""Day One,"" working especially with police and law enforcement who ""know who these people are."" His fifth point centered on the enforcement of all immigration laws. The Clinton campaigned highlighted this part of the speech to back up Clinton’s debate comments. ""In a Trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced ... As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement. And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done. Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country."" Trump said his deportation priorities included criminals, security threats and visa overstays. According to some estimates, about 40 percent of the undocumented population came to the United States on visas and overstayed their departure date. While Trump emphasized removal of undocumented criminal immigrants and of those who arrived illegally, Clinton’s claim that every undocumented immigrant would be subject to deportation has merits. In other parts of the Phoenix speech, Trump said undocumented immigrants would eventually have to return to their home countries and apply for re-entry. ""Those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only: To return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined,"" Trump said. But Trump also gave another mixed message within the same speech. He said that after accomplishing enforcement and deportation goals, after building a wall, ending illegal immigration and establishing a new lawful immigration system, ""then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain."" That suggests that while every undocumented person could potentially be deported (""subject to deportation""), they won’t all be deported. Our ruling Clinton claimed that Trump said ""as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation."" Trump said Aug. 31 that anyone in the country illegally who wants lawful status has to go back home and apply for re-entry, and that those who came illegally are subject to deportation. But Trump also said ""then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain."" That suggests he doesn’t intend to deport literally every undocumented person. Clinton’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Fact-checking theories about bricks and Black Lives Matter protests
","Some of the latest theories about the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests have been built with bricks. After the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after a white officer kneeled on his neck, demonstrations erupted in more than 350 cities across the country. As some turned violent, protesters started hurling bricks at buildings and police officers. Some say that tactic was planned. Dozens of social media posts published over the past few days show images and videos of brick piles in several American cities. A May 31 article from Law Enforcement Today, a website that has published misleading information in the past, says the mysterious footage suggests left-wing activists planned for violence at Black Lives Matter demonstrations. ""There are many who were thinking that these riots have antifa written all over them and that appears to be getting confirmed that these riots were planned, orchestrated events,"" the website wrote. The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 27,000 times in conservative and law enforcement Facebook groups. (Screenshot from Law Enforcement Today) The story mainly pulls from a May 31 Breitbart article, which strings together photos and videos of bricks from protests around the country. But Law Enforcement Today goes a step further, saying the footage suggests that ""riots were planned, orchestrated events."" Is there evidence to support that claim? The short answer: Not really. The longer answer: It depends on the city. Kyle Reyes, the national spokesman for Law Enforcement Today, said the story was based on two anonymous sources within the Dallas Police Department. Those officers sent the website footage of brick pallets in Dallas. ""They told us that protesters didn’t put them there, but someone did and they don’t belong there,"" Reyes said. However, Reyes said Law Enforcement Today was unable to verify photos and videos of bricks in other American cities. In Kansas City, Mo., police spokesman Capt. David Jackson said there was reason to believe that protesters were stashing bricks ""for nefarious use."" ""We have located some bricks that have been left in a couple of areas,"" he told reporters May 31. ""We’re going to do our best to get those picked up and moved so they’re not used. I don’t know who would have put them there — I don’t think they’re doing any type of construction or anything like that."" However, in a story about Jackson’s comments, the Daily Caller wrote that ""so far, only the Kansas City Police Department has linked the discovery of pallets of bricks to pre-planned rioting."" That jibes with what other police departments told PolitiFact. For example, in San Francisco — one of the cities mentioned in Law Enforcement Today’s article — police don’t believe that Black Lives Matter protesters are creating piles of bricks to throw at people. ""We have no information to support that,"" Michael Andraychak, a public information officer for the San Francisco Police Department, said in an email. ""Bricks for a construction project were delivered in one San Francisco neighborhood. The contractor was contacted and the bricks were moved."" Frisco, Texas, north of Dallas, is another city where social media users have posted photos of brick piles. One Facebook post in a conspiratorial group called ""Expose the Truth"" claims a pallet of bricks showed up ""on the path of the protest."" ""You wanna tell me this is not planned and organized now?"" reads the post, which is a screenshot of a tweet. (Screenshot from Facebook) Police in Frisco say that’s not what happened. ""The pallets of bricks, while they were near the area, it wasn’t along the route or anything like that,"" said James Willis, a public information officer for the Frisco Police Department. ""Those pallets had been there for over a week."" The bricks belong to the homeowner’s association of a neighborhood in town, which was planning to use them to repair a retaining wall, Willis said. Once the police told the neighborhood that people were concerned that protesters could use the bricks, the HOA moved them. Elsewhere, social media rumors have falsely implicated the police in staging bricks at Black Lives Matter protests.  A YouTube video published by rapper King Tussin on June 1 purports to show police officers in Boston unloading bricks from a pickup truck ""in riot zones."" We reached out to the Boston Police Department for more context. We haven’t heard back, but a June 2 statement from the Northeastern University Police Department in Boston said officers were cleaning up a ""damaged brick sidewalk."" On Monday, June 1, while on a routine patrol of campus, two of our officers came across a damaged brick sidewalk at the corner of Tremont and Coventry streets that posed a safety hazard for pedestrians due to loose, upturned and broken bricks. We also reached out to the police departments in Dallas and Fayetteville, N.C., both of which are mentioned in the Law Enforcement Today article. We haven’t heard back. An investigation from NBC News found that some of the bricks shown in Dallas were close to a construction site and had been there for months. Another investigation from BBC News found that bricks show in Fayetteville had also been there since before the Floyd protests began. Photos and videos of bricks have also been used to spin other baseless theories on social media. Some Facebook posts have used photos of bricks to make unproven claims about the connection between violence at Black Lives Matter protests and antifa, a broad coalition of anti-fascist, left-wing groups. Others alleged the bricks prove that the violence has been pre-planned. And some asserted that billionaire philanthropist George Soros is behind the supply of bricks. There is no evidence to support any of those claims. A Law Enforcement Today article claims that ""piles of bricks are being staged in cities around the country, indicating riots are planned."" While police in Kansas City have said they suspect bricks are being stashed for nefarious purposes, there is no evidence that such a tactic is being widely used. Officials in several other cities have said there is no connection between footage of bricks and Black Lives Matter protests. The article contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Claim that Florida is undercounting COVID-19 deaths uses flawed comparison
","The COVID-19 death toll has become a political football. Democratic politicians and groups suggested on social media that government officials have misidentified COVID-19 deaths as pneumonia cases in an effort to conceal the true coronavirus death count. ""According to the CDC, so far this year, Florida has had 1,762 deaths from COVID-19 and 5,185 from pneumonia. Average pneumonia deaths in Florida from 2013-2018 for the same time period are 918. Probably just a coincidence, yeah?"" stated a May 27 Facebook post by the New Florida Majority, a liberal group. The post included a photo of Gov. Ron DeSantis. The group got the information from a viral tweet by Kellen Squire, an ER nurse in Virginia. According to the CDC, so far this year, Florida has had 1,762 deaths from #COVID and 5,185 from pneumonia.Average pneumonia deaths in Florida from 2013-2018 for the same time period are 918.Probably just a coincidence, yeah? The tweet drew tens of thousands of likes and shares over the next few days and was echoed by Democratic political figures. Former party chairman Howard Dean accused Florida of ""cooking the books."" That doesn’t appear to be what happened. While some of the numbers in the post are in the ballpark, the way Squire compared them creates a misleading picture.  RELATED: COVID-19 skeptics say there’s an overcount. Doctors in the field say the opposite This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Squire, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017, told us he drew his information from a Reddit thread showing death data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The r/coronavirus thread said Florida’s pneumonia deaths were in the 900 range between 2015 and 2018, but jumped above 4,000 this year. Squire ran with those numbers for his tweet, pulling in CDC estimates for Florida deaths from COVID-19 and pneumonia this year. (The data for 2019 has not yet been finalized.) But that comparison doesn’t work, said Bob Anderson, the chief of the Mortality Statistics Branch in the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. The issue is the way causes of death are coded in CDC data. If the death certificate mentions both COVID-19 and pneumonia, both codes are included in CDC data for the current year, and the death will be allocated to both categories in the CDC’s provisional surveillance system, which keeps a rough running tally of deaths in a given year. In 2021, when the CDC finalizes the data and reports national statistics for 2020 cases, it will focus on the underlying cause of death, and assign only one cause to each death. In a case where both pneumonia and COVID-19 are reported on the death certificate, the underlying cause will almost always be COVID-19, Anderson said.   In recent years, the number of Florida residents whose underlying cause of death was pneumonia was in the 900s through this point in the year. (When Anderson looked at a separate category of deaths that occurred in Florida, which includes residents and visitors, the numbers were slightly higher.) For the 5,185 figure that Squire tweeted, ""many of them actually are pneumonia due to COVID-19, or pneumonia due to other conditions such as influenza,"" Anderson said. ""But the fact is those with pneumonia due to COVID-19 would be counted in both COVID-19 and pneumonia category"" in the provisional data. So what these posts did was take the 900 figure, which referred to cases in recent years where pneumonia is the underlying cause of death, and compare that to a broader category of cases this year where pneumonia is mentioned on a death certificate, data which is provisional at this point. That said, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's leading infectious-disease specialist, and other medical experts have said the government’s COVID-19 death toll is an undercount. There are several reasons why a COVID-19 death might not be reported as such, including that a test was not available or that the person died at home.  ""It is likely we are underestimating the number of deaths at this point from COVID-19, but it’s going to vary from state to state,"" Anderson said. A spokeswoman for the New Florida Majority, which posted the claim on Facebook, pointed to an article by The Daily Beast about undercounting of COVID deaths in Florida and elsewhere. Florida’s public data reporting about COVID-19 deaths has drawn scrutiny. In May, a state Department of Health employee said she was pressured to manipulate data and was fired. A spokeswoman for Gov. Ron DeSantis said the employee had been insubordinate and the state denied any manipulation of the data. However, county medical examiners have reported higher death counts than the state. A Facebook post said, ""According to the CDC, so far this year, Florida has had 1,762 deaths from COVID-19 and 5,185 from pneumonia. Average pneumonia deaths in Florida from 2013-2018 for the same time period are 918. Probably just a coincidence, yeah?""  Each number here stems from actual data, but the post makes comparisons between them that are misleading. Pneumonia deaths in Florida are up this year compared with some recent years, but the tweet ignores that the CDC’s provisional data for this year counts some deaths for now as being caused by both pneumonia and COVID-19. Finalized 2020 data released next year will list only one underlying cause of death.

Fact-checking the claim that Trump has been 'exposed for raping a 13-year-old'

The lawsuit referenced in the post is from 2016 and was dropped before any litigation began in earnest to evaluate the allegations. The post includes images of the first four pages of the initial complaint, which was filed against then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. We confirmed with online court records that the pages are the same as those in the actual lawsuit. The federal case was brought in New York by Jane Doe, a woman who requested to maintain her anonymity. She alleged the two men raped her during parties hosted by Epstein in the summer of 1994, when she was 13. She also alleged that Trump threatened her and her family with physical harm if she told anyone. A lawyer for Trump called the lawsuit at the time ""a complete fabrication.""  The woman dropped the lawsuit in November 2016. Two days earlier, she had been expected to appear at a news conference, but it was abruptly canceled; her attorney, Lisa Bloom, said the woman had received threats and was too frightened to appear. Epstein was charged in July 2019 with running a sex-trafficking ring involving underage girls. His death in his New York jail cell in August 2019 was ruled a suicide, although the circumstances of his death have been disputed. A recent Facebook post says President Donald Trump was ""exposed for raping a 13-year-old"" in retaliation for law enforcement officers ""killing black people."" A 2016 lawsuit accused Trump, then a candidate for president, of raping a minor, but no evidence was put forth before the case was dropped.

Not legal to ‘hit the gas and plow through’ menacing protesters with a vehicle
","If you’re driving along and come upon protesters in the street who menace you, do you have the legal right to run them over? That’s essentially a claim on Facebook that was posted during demonstrations around the country over the death of George Floyd. The May 31 post shows a screengrab of a Google search result that turns up a snippet from Quora, a website that allows users to post questions and answers. The Google search bar query is cut off by the image, but it begins ""can I hit someone if they are bl..."". Underneath, the featured search result shows this question and answer snippet from Quora: ""Is it legal to run over protesters that are blocking the road?"" Part of the answer shown is, ""if the protesters at any time start banging on your windows, threatening you and trying to get in your vehicle, you can by all means hit the gas and plow through them.""     The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, we wondered if the image shown in the post was legitimate. Does a search for that question really turn up this result? We tried to duplicate the search and didn’t get the same results. When we inquired with Google about the search snippet shown in the post, spokeswoman Lara Levin told us that such featured snippets are generated automatically but that the company has incorporated policies that should guide what appears. She said such snippet search results are dynamic, though — ""they can appear, disappear or reappear for a given query based on what other relevant information might be available to show."" Levin said that though there are systems designed to exclude content that doesn’t adhere to policies, they ""are not perfect, so if violating snippets appear, we will take action in accordance with our policies."" She said that following PolitiFact’s inquiry, Google ""evaluated (this snippet) against our policies and found it to be in violation of our dangerous content policy, so we will be taking action accordingly."" It seems that’s because the advice surfaced in the search is without merit, a half dozen legal scholars told PolitiFact. Six law professors told PolitiFact that laws vary by state, but essentially the legal question is whether the use of force is justified as self-defense.  ""The fundamental point is that a moving motor vehicle is a deadly weapon. Therefore, all these questions are, at bottom, about when you are authorized to use deadly force against another person,"" said Frank Bowman III of the University of Missouri. Using force is generally permissible to defend yourself from another person’s wrongful use of force against you, but it has to be proportionate, said Fordham University law professor Nicholas Johnson and University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt.  ""In particular, deadly force is not allowed unless it’s a response to a threat of death or great bodily harm. Hitting someone with a car is deadly force. So, the question would be at what point would a motorist reasonably believe they were threatened with death or serious injury. Just blocking the road is clearly not enough, though,"" Roosevelt said. The law generally would not permit a driver to plow through a group of protesters who were blocking the road and were banging on windows, threatening and trying to get in the vehicle, said University of Wyoming law professor George Mocsary and Keith Findley, who teaches law at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  ""Stepping on the gas and plowing through a group of people would almost certainly cause death or great bodily harm to probably numerous people. The threat of imminent death or great bodily harm would have to be more real than that,"" Findley said.  The question is whether the driver of the car reasonably thought he or she was about to be killed or suffer serious harm unless the car moved, said Vanderbilt University’s Christopher Slobogin, and whether the driver was reasonable in thinking that anyone hit by the car ""was threatening such harm or would not be seriously hurt by it."" One circumstance that potentially stands out is if a person forced their way into your car and you feared for your life, said Bowman.  Some states have ""no retreat"" or ""make my day"" laws that authorize use of deadly force against those who unlawfully enter property, sometimes including vehicles. But the driver’s use of force must be proportionate to any threat, he said. A Facebook post claimed that if protesters blocking the road ""start banging on your windows, threatening you and trying to get in your vehicle,"" it is legal to ""hit the gas and plow through them."" Experts said such use of deadly force would be legal only if the driver feared for their life and using the vehicle was proportionate to the amount of force being used against the driver.

'Riot manual' is misinformation from 2015
","As Americans continue to protest George Floyd’s death, new false theories about how protestors are organized and funded continue to appear on social media.

The document goes on to use code language and vague descriptions of contracts, payments, and how they will implement violent practices during a demonstration.  The manual appears to have been created to falsely blame a Democrat super PAC, Friends of Democracy, for violent protesting in 2015. Friends of Democracy was a Democrat super PAC created in 2012 by Jonathan Soros, son of George Soros, and David Donnelly, then the executive director of the Public Campaign Action Fund. The Friends of Democracy and Public Campaign Action Fund merged to create Every Voice Action in 2014. The ""manual"" refers to protests in Baltimore in April 2015 over Freddie Gray’s death. Gray was arrested for appearing to have a switchblade and then suffered from a spinal cord injury and died in police custody. Some of the protests in Baltimore did become violent, but the one this document talks about escalating into a riot was not. Back then, NBC reported that protestors gathered in front of the Western District station, put their hands up and turned their backs to the police station. There was no complicated route like the one shown in the ""riot manual,"" and there were only peaceful demonstrations.

Erin Burnett corrects inaccurate statements about Insurrection Act
","Shortly after law enforcement officers were ordered to push peaceful protesters out of Lafayette Square so that Donald Trump could walk from the White House to St. John’s Episcopal Church for a photo opportunity, CNN anchor Erin Burnett made several mentions of a law that Trump had been considering invoking: the Insurrection Act of 1807. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" Trump said from the White House’s Rose Garden, referring to the looting and other violence that followed the death in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Soon after the start of her show, ""Erin Burnett OutFront,"" Burnett referred to Trump’s possible use of the law. The president, she said, was ""basically saying that he is going to go ahead with an act back from 1807 for the first time, mobilizing U.S. military troops on American soil for the first time since 1807."" Burnett repeated this point several times during her show. She said that ""moments ago"" Trump said that ""he is mobilizing the U.S. military for the first time since 1807 under the Insurrection Act to go into the states, to deploy them and quickly solve the problem for them, if the cities and states refuse."" She repeated this later, during an exchange with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. When Cuomo asked, ""When was the last time you saw the American military called out against Americans?"" Burnett responded, ""1807."" Finally, she repeated it in an exchange with former CNN anchor Bernard Shaw.  She said that Trump would be ""invoking an act not invoked since 1807 to deploy U.S. military troops on American soil."" There’s a problem, however. While the Insurrection Act was indeed passed and signed by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807, it has been invoked many times since then, a reality that Burnett tweeted a correction after the show. The 1807 law allows state governments to seek assistance from the federal government to put down insurrections. It also allows, in limited circumstances, the U.S. military to be deployed domestically without the consent of the state. The consensual provision was last used in May 1992, amid riots in Los Angeles after the acquittals of officers charged with the beating of Rodney King, a black motorist. The assistance was requested by then-California Gov. Pete Wilson. The provision that allows the president to override state officials has been invoked as well, historically to protect the civil rights of black Americans in the 1950s and 1960s.  Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy used these provisions in Arkansas, Alabama and Mississippi to enforce civil rights laws, and Kennedy invoked it to send federal troops to Birmingham, Ala., during civil rights protests. After her show Burnett tweeted, ""I mistakenly said tonight that the insurrection act hasn’t been invoked since 1807. That’s incorrect. The last time it was used was 1992."" I mistakenly said tonight that the insurrection act hasn’t been invoked since 1807. That’s incorrect. The last time it was used was 1992.   Burnett said that if Trump decides to deploy the U.S. military domestically, he would be ""mobilizing U.S. military troops on American soil for the first time since 1807.""

The Twitter user who posted the video also identified the location as being ""taken at Target in downtown Seattle.""  When we contacted Seattle Police on June 1, a spokesman told us the officers in the video were trying to gain entry into a store and, once they did, they arrested three men inside on burglary charges. The video shows Seattle officers in front of the downtown Target about 1:30 a.m. on May 31, the spokesman said. The officers had seen a large hole in a front window of the store; the clip shows one of them trying to break more glass in order to gain entry. The officers eventually got inside the store and arrested three men from Washington state on burglary charges, the spokesman said. Also on June 1, Seattle police published a number of tweets about the incident.  ""We've received a number of questions about this video,"" read one. It shows officers responding to a *burglary* at the 2nd/Pike Target @ ~1:30 AM on 5/31.

It pointed readers to a link showing the 911 automated feed and noted that the call was closed at 4:22 a.m. In response to another question on the social media platform, the agency tweeted: ""As referenced above, it appears the suspects entered through a large hole in the glass windows. Officers used the same access point to enter after clearing some of the jagged glass."" Additionally, an online Seattle police blotter lists the incident 2020-177666, labeled as a burglary/breaking and entering, at 1:14 a.m. on May 31 in the 1400 block of Second Ave. The Target store’s address is 1401 Second Ave. PolitiFact requested a copy of the police report about the incident, but did not immediately receive a response.

How a false conspiracy theory about a Washington communications blackout went viral on Twitter
","It had only been June for two hours when SoyBoy2020 sent the tweet. ""WTF is happening? #DCBlackout."" The post was the first instance of the hashtag #dcblackout on Twitter that day. It got four retweets and 13 likes — not bad considering SoyBoy2020 has only five followers. Under normal circumstances, it might have ended there. But by the end of June 1, #dcblackout had become a viral conspiracy theory on Twitter, highlighting how uncertainty surrounding Black Lives Matter protests around the country can lead to the rapid spread of misinformation on social media. On May 31, demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after a white officer kneeled on his neck, hit a fever pitch in Washington, D.C. Protesters faced off with police and National Guard troops overnight. Multiple fires burned near the White House, and the Washington Monument was surrounded by smoke. In the early hours of June 1, Twitter users like SoyBoy2020 used the chaos to plant the seeds of a false narrative about a government crackdown on protesters.  The hoax goes like this: To quell unrest at Black Lives Matter demonstrations, officials in Washington started ""jamming all communications."" That move prevented protesters from using their cell phones to contact each other.  ""how does dc go from being on fire to being completely silent?? somethings not adding up,"" wrote one of the first Twitter users to share the hashtag, which has been mentioned hundreds of thousands of times.

But that didn’t stop #dcblackout from taking off on Twitter.  By 3 a.m. on the East Coast — one hour after the first mention — the hashtag had been used tens of thousands of times. By 7 a.m., it was showing up in Twitter’s list of trending topics. It’s not uncommon for hashtags containing misinformation to trend on Twitter. But experts say #dcblackout appears to have been part of a coordinated social media disinformation campaign. ""This is at 2 in the morning, and within the hour, this hashtag has been used 50,000 times,"" said Darren Linvill, an associate professor and disinformation expert at Clemson University. ""That doesn't happen when some anonymous account with three followers makes up a hashtag at 2 in the morning. That doesn't happen naturally."" Using a tool called Botometer, which detects whether Twitter accounts have bot-like characteristics, we determined that dozens of the accounts that first shared #dcblackout appear to be automated or partially automated. Others pivoted from tweeting infrequently or about other subjects to posting about Black Lives Matter protests — one sign that a coordinated disinformation campaign is afoot. As people started waking up on the East Coast, the hashtag quickly grew as it was shared among protest sympathizers looking for answers. It incorporated other pieces of misinformation, such as a photo from the ABC show ""Designated Survivor"" that some Twitter users claimed showed Washington in flames. One of the photos that was going around, looked similar to the photo above but was actually a screengrab from the ABC Show Designated Survivor. Make sure you do a reverse image search of photos before you share them, especially as news is quickly unfolding. pic.twitter.com/SOYHOE1ysH Then things got weird. Linvill noticed that several Twitter accounts started sharing the exact same language about #dcblackout. It started with a tweet from someone named Bethany at 9 a.m. Yeah...... as someone seeing #dcblackout trending, who lives and works in the DC metro area, and who has friends telecommuting into DC rn..... This hashtag looks like misinformation. ""No social media from DC"" because we were asleep. Stop scaring people. #dcsafe Botometer suggests that Bethany is a real account holder. But her tweet was copied verbatim hundreds of times by other accounts — including some that appeared to have been hacked. This is alarming. Lol pic.twitter.com/7xbibbJBul One of them was Jason Elia, an author and filmmaker who has a verified account on Twitter. At 11:18 a.m., he tweeted the exact same words that Bethany posted more than two hours before. However, in a follow-up tweet, he said it wasn’t him. The fuck?! I swear I did not tweet this. I’m in fucking Oklahoma City currently. I hate DC and very few reasons would ever get me to go there. Also I only tweet from iPhone. https://t.co/snRsQFgy4l Hacking Twitter accounts is a tactic that disinformation campaigns employ to turn authentic users into propaganda machines. ProPublica reported that a recent coronavirus-related operation that uses hacked accounts has ties to the Chinese government. In this case, Linvill said the goal of the disinformation campaign was probably to sow confusion by manipulating the conversation on both sides of the hashtag. ""This is not some guy in his basement,"" he said. We reached out to Twitter repeatedly for a comment on #dcblackout, but we haven’t heard back. Spokesman Brandon Borrman told the Washington Post that the company has taken action against some of the accounts sharing the hashtag. ""We’re taking action proactively on any coordinated attempts to disrupt the public conversation around this issue,"" he said. ""We are actively investigating the hashtag #dcblackout and during that process have already suspended hundreds of spammy accounts that tweeted using the hashtag."" Even as media outlets started debunking the hoax and Twitter began taking action, #dcblackout continued to grow.  On Twitter, users doubting the #dcblackout conspiracy theory added to its rise. Around noon, the bulk of accounts tweeting with the hashtag were authentic, according to Hoaxy, another tool that measures Twitter accounts with bot-like characteristics.  (Screenshot from Hoaxy) By 1 p.m., Google search results for the hoax returned no news articles about it, creating what misinformation researchers call a ""data void,"" where the absence of credible information about a topic provides a fertile environment for misinformation to proliferate. The conspiracy theory that Washington officials were restricting the communications of Black Lives Matter protesters also made its way to other social media platforms.  We found several examples of claims related to #dcblackout shared by political pages on Facebook. Some of the pages had names with terms used by far-right extremists and were created within the past few weeks. Linvill said disinformation campaigns like #dcblackout prey on unsuspecting social media users to push a specific narrative. To avoid them, he suggests staying vigilant about what you share and how you protect yourself online. ""You have to realize that your social media account is a tool that other people want access to for a variety of reasons,"" Linvill said. Twitter posts using the hashtag #dcblackout suggested that officials in Washington started ""jamming all communications"" to quell unrest at Black Lives Matter demonstrations. There’s no evidence of any effort. Experts say #dcblackout appears to have been part of a coordinated social media disinformation campaign that grew on Twitter and spread to other platforms.  We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2020/jun/02/tweets/how-false-conspiracy-theory-about-washington-commu/

Black Lives Matter activists are not planning riots in Fresno
","As protests against police brutality intensify across the country, activists and officials trying to keep the peace are having to contend with social media misinformation.  A recent post implies that a Black Lives Matter group in Fresno, Calif., is planning a riot Tuesday afternoon. The post features a screenshot of an iPhone note with instructions for what appears to be a pre-planned riot.  ""BLM FRESNO RIOTS,"" the post reads. ""Riots will begin @ 4 pm in River Park on 06/02/20.""  The post goes on to outline the purported objectives of the riots:  ""Tear up Caucasian infrastructure,""  ""Send a message to the PD,"" and  ""Fight back the oppressors.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post is not tied to Black Lives Matter in any way. Black activists in Fresno have categorically denied that they have made plans to riot in Fresno on the afternoon of June 2.  Chris Milton, a businessman who spoke at a peaceful protest of George Floyd’s death on Sunday in Fresno, said during a Facebook Live video that the post was not affiliated with Black Lives Matter. ""There’s some stuff going around right now where there’s supposed to be this planned riot,"" Milton said. ""It’s fake. That has absolutely nothing to do with Black Lives Matter. That is not a Black Lives Matter movement."" He added that the peaceful protest that occurred in downtown Fresno on Sunday was ""the movement from the black population here in Fresno."" He emphasized that black activists in Fresno are prioritizing keeping the peace.  ""It’s not about tearing up businesses, it’s not about disabling infrastructure,"" Milton said. ""Don’t fall for the hype."" He attributed the post to white nationalist groups that have been angered by seeing black and white Americans unite for a common cause.  The Fresno State University NAACP chapter also took to social media to discourage people from participating in the riots described in the Facebook post.  ""The Fresno State NAACP does NOT condone this event,"" the tweet reads. ""We are encouraging people DO NOT ATTEND this event for the safety of all."" D’Aungillique Jackson, president of the Fresno State NAACP chapter, also addressed the post in an Instagram video, encouraging people not to participate in the riots. ""That flyer is bogus. Do not go out there and tear up this city,"" Jackson said. She said the post was made by people who were ""impostering the Black Lives Matter movement."" Jackson’s Instagram post also notes that Fresno doesn’t have a Black Lives Matter chapter. The only California-based official chapters of the Black Lives Matter organization can be found in Los Angeles and Long Beach. By Monday afternoon the Fresno Police Department said it was aware of the post about the planned riot. The department posted a statement on Facebook.   ""We have dedicated several resources to tracking the validity of this threat and we are working towards a peaceful solution to any group that may want to be heard in our community,"" read the Facebook post.  A few hours later, Fresno Police Chief Andrew Hall posted a news release on Facebook addressing the post about the riots. ""I will be adjusting the mission of several units and there will be increased patrols and tactical units addressing the City’s commercial businesses,"" Hall said in the news release. Air support, undercover units and tactical units would be prepared and acting as ""a watchful eye on those who would victimize"" the city, Hall said. He declined to recommend a curfew, saying his community ""just successfully had one of the largest peaceful demonstrations in this country."" A post suggests that a Black Lives Matter Group in Fresno has planned a riot for Tuesday afternoon with the goal of destroying infrastructure and sending a message to police.  Black activists in Fresno have denounced the riot post, discouraged people from attending and said it was not organized by a Black Lives Matter group. Fresno police are investigating the threat, but do not see fit to issue a curfew for the city at this time.  We rate this post False.",/factchecks/2020/jun/02/facebook-posts/black-lives-matter-activists-are-not-planning-riot/

Fact-checking claims that Pelosi tried to add abortion funding in new coronavirus bill
","In March, conservative groups falsely accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of trying to include abortion funding in the first coronavirus stimulus bill.  Now, anti-abortion website Life News claims that Pelosi has been ""caught"" trying to do something similar in a $3 trillion package that passed the House on May 15, 2020. ""Pelosi is back at it — trying to remove the safeguards from the previous bill to exclude Planned Parenthood from small business bailouts in her new Phase 4 relief legislation,"" the story says.  It also claims that, under the bill’s proposal to help state and local governments, ""states would be free to pass along taxpayer dollars to the Planned Parenthood abortion business."" The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  There is an element of truth to the claim that the bill does not explicitly restrict states from using funds to cover abortion services, but it leaves out important context that could give a different impression. The Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act passed the House by a vote of 208-199, with only one Republican in favor. It awaits action in the Senate, where its prospects are dim. The key provisions include nearly $1 trillion for state and local governments, a $200 billion hazard-pay fund for essential workers, and $75 billion to support coronavirus testing, contact tracing and patient isolation. The bill also offers a new round of direct payments to families. It’s meant to boost the economic support to individuals and businesses provided by the $2 trillion CARES Act. RELATED: House coronavirus bill would aid immigrants, relatives cut out of previous aid package Pelosi’s office called headlines that she was caught trying to include abortion funding in the new bill ""completely false."" The bill does not mention abortion. What Life News and other websites are talking about, in part, involves eligibility for the Paycheck Protection Program established in March. The program offered low-interest loans to small businesses and nonprofits to keep employees on the payroll during the first months of the coronavirus pandemic. The program is administered by the Small Business Administration with support from the Treasury Department. The CARES Act included a cap on the size of organizations that could receive the money, but the new House bill attempts to expand nonprofit organizations’ access to aid by setting aside 25% of available PPP funds for nonprofits, removing the size and category restrictions for them and steering more aid to smaller nonprofits. Proposed changes to the PPP provisions aren’t specific to Planned Parenthood, which offers a range of women’s health services that includes abortions. But the expanded guidelines would make a large group like Planned Parenthood eligible for the loans. Meanwhile, there’s already a fight over about $80 million in subsidized SBA loans that were given to state and local Planned Parenthood affiliates. Over 125 Republicans have called for a federal investigation into the loans, and the SBA ordered the chapters to give back the money, saying they’re too closely affiliated with the national organization to be considered independent entities.  Planned Parenthood released a statement denouncing the criticism, saying its independent affiliates complied with eligibility rules in applying for and receiving the loans.  Other corporate entities, such as AutoNation and Ruth’s Hospitality Group (which owns Ruth’s Chris Steak House), have faced similar scrutiny for receiving millions in PPP loans through their local affiliates. The companies said they will return the money. The Treasury says it will audit every company that received more than $2 million from the programs. The Life News claim that ""states would be free to pass along taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood"" stems from a provision to give fiscal relief to state and local governments. The HEROES Act provides $540 billion in funding to assist state governments with the fiscal impacts from the public health emergency, and $375 billion to local governments.  The website quotes Tom McClusky, president of the anti-abortion group March for Life Action, as saying the bill would allow federal tax dollars to pay for abortions through subsidized health care plans and would authorize over $900 billion in ""open-ended funding"" at the state and local level, ""so nothing would prevent this money from further subsidizing the abortion industry."" The bill doesn’t include the Hyde Amendment budgetary rider, which prohibits the federal government from covering the costs of abortions except in very rare cases. The concern is that without the rider, state and local governments could pass some of the money along to Planned Parenthood for abortion services. In the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, the first emergency aid bill, language was amended by Democrats to limit funds to cover only COVID-19 expenses. So far, the same has not been done in the HEROES Act. Specifically, the Hyde Amendment states that federal Medicaid funds cannot cover an abortion unless the woman’s life is in danger or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. But it does not limit a state’s ability to use its own funds to cover abortion. As of January 2020, 15 states use their own funds to extend abortion coverage to Medicaid enrollees, while 34 states and the District of Columbia follow the amendment’s standards. One state, South Dakota, does not follow Hyde standards and pays for abortions only when they are necessary to protect a woman's life. Laurie Sobel, associate director of women’s health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said the suggestion that states could use emergency funds for abortion services is not easy to respond to, but it wouldn’t happen through Medicaid. Any added federal money for Medicaid, Sobel said, would likely come in the form of increased reimbursements to states for the federal share of most Medicaid expenses, in which the Hyde language applies.  She said it’s unlikely that the state's general emergency funds will be able to be spent freely, but rather that the funds will be designated for particular uses. We reached out to Life News for comment but didn’t hear back by time of publication. A website claims that Pelosi tried ""once again"" to include abortion funding in the latest coronavirus bill.  The HEROES Act does not contain any mention of abortion, and there is no section that funnels money specifically for those services.  As is, the bill would make it easier for nonprofit organizations, including large ones like Planned Parenthood, to receive funds under the Paycheck Protection Program.  Anti-abortion groups are also pointing to the lack of language explicitly barring state and local governments from using federal relief money to fund abortions as evidence of Pelosi getting ""caught.""  But health policy experts say the Hyde amendment restrictions still apply to federal support under Medicaid, and that aid to states will likely be designated for specific uses, and won’t be open-ended. The claim is largely speculative about the use of the money and oversimplifies the allocation of federal funds.

Suspended Twitter account fans misinformation about antifa, George Floyd protests
","After President Donald Trump blamed violent protests across the country on antifa, Facebook and Twitter users started spreading misinformation about the left-wing movement. A Facebook post published May 31 shows a screenshot of a tweet from a now-suspended account called ""ANTIFA America."" The tweet claimed the anti-fascist protest movement planned to move into white residential areas to continue protesting the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody after a white officer knelt on his neck. ""Antifa is warning that tonight they're moving out of the cities — and into residential areas to 'take what's ours,’"" reads the caption on the Facebook post, which was published by a page called U.S. Law Enforcement. ""Law enforcement across the country on high alert."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 6,300 times. There is no evidence to support the Facebook post or the deleted tweet.  (Screenshot from Facebook) We can’t access the original ANTIFA America tweet since the account has been suspended. We reached out to Twitter for a comment on why it was suspended, but we haven’t heard back. What we do know is that there is no national organization for antifa, which means there is no official Twitter account for the movement. And there were no reports we could find of antifa or other groups specifically targeting white residentials. Antifa is a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing, anti-fascist activists. It has no leaders and is organized into autonomous local groups. The movement has participated in several protests across the country in recent years, including the 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Antifa activists have a history of attacking police officers and journalists during demonstrations.  ""Unfortunately, with the rioting that is occurring in many of our cities around the country, the voices of peaceful protests are being hijacked by violent radical elements,"" said Attorney General William Barr on May 30. ""In many places it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by far left extremist groups and anarchic groups using antifa-like tactics."" But as of now, there is no proof that antifa activists are the primary demonstrators stoking violence at Black Lives Matter protesters across the country. Neither Trump nor Barr have offered public evidence that the leftist movement is behind the demonstrations. And while they are probably part of the protests, experts say it’s unlikely that antifa groups are culpable for a significant portion of damage. ""I haven’t seen any instances in these demonstrations of groups marching behind a banner saying, ‘Hey, we are antifa,’"" said Mark Bray, a part-time lecturer at Rutgers University and author of ""Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook."" ""That said, I think there's a fair likelihood that some antifa groups have participated in the protests that we've seen."" Antifa activists sometimes use property destruction as a political strategy. In 2017, antifa groups confronted police and smashed windows at the University of California-Berkeley to protest a speech from right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos. But Bray said the notion that the anti-fascist movement is behind much of the violence and vandalism at Black Lives Matter protests doesn’t hold water. ""The key issue here is that they are not nearly numerous or politically consequential enough to pull off the most massive rebellion this country has seen in the past 50 years,"" he said. We reached out to the National Guard and police departments in several major cities for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. We checked the Twitter accounts for local antifa cells in New York City, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Philadelphia. None of them have tweeted about ""moving out of the cities and into residential areas,"" as the Facebook post claims. We could find no news reports about antifa-led protests in residential areas on the evening of May 31. Without additional evidence, the Facebook post is inaccurate.

 Ex-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin did not die in jail
","As demonstrations against police brutality escalate in size and scope, so is social media misinformation. RELATED: Fact-checking misinformation about the George Floyd protests in Minneapolis  On May 31, a website called ""W24 News"" published an article with a headline that said Derek Chauvin, the ex-Minneapolis police officer who knelt on George Floyd’s neck, committed suicide in his cell. The headline reads: ""Minneapolis Police Officer who killed George Floyd, Derek Chauvin commits suicide in prison cell."" This isn’t true. The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The article says that, on May 31, ""John Harrington, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, announced that Chauvin committed suicide after his arrest in his Minnesota jail cell."" It attributed the report to WCCO Minneapolis, a local CBS affiliate news station. We could find no such announcement by the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, nor any report by WCCO that said Chauvin died in jail under any circumstances. The claim only exists on W24n, a junk news website that has published several hoax stories including one that said President Barack Obama tested positive for the coronavirus. Chauvin was arrested on charges of third-degree murder and manslaughter on May 29 and was originally held at Ramsey County Jail in St. Paul. He was moved on May 31, first to Hennepin County Jail and then to Oak Park Heights prison. In a press conference that night, Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnells said the transfer wasn’t ""uncommon"" among high-profile inmates and was made, in part, due to COVID-19 transmission concerns and the anticipation that a large number of people could be booked into the county jail amid the ongoing protests.
