Greg Abbott’s office has prosecuted public officials 104 times; most not corruption cases
","Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott drew heat for a Feb. 4 2014, speech in which he likened official corruption scandals in Texas-Mexico border counties to ""third-world practices,"" a comment PolitiFact Texas unpacked in a Feb. 11 In Context article. His comparison drew criticism from lawmakers, the McAllen newspaper and his main opponent in the governor’s race, Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis, who said, ""Abbott even went as far as comparing the Texas border to a third-world country."" (Abbott soon after won the Republican gubernatorial nomination in the March 2014 primary.) Responding to such criticism, Abbott said in a Feb. 10 opinion article in the McAllen Monitor that his concerns about corruption expressed in his speech ""apply wherever corruption is found."" ""Public service is a public trust,"" Abbott wrote. ""As attorney general, I have prosecuted judges, district attorneys and other public officials across Texas who violated that trust, who have been corrupted."" We were curious about that because the attorney general’s office doesn’t focus on battling violent crime. That’s the purview of local prosecutors and police departments. As the Texas Constitution makes clear, the primary job of the attorney general is representing the state in civil matters. Still, state law permits the attorney general to help prosecute a criminal case if a local prosecutor requests assistance. For such purposes, state lawmakers have allowed the attorney general to employ peace officers and lawyers with backgrounds in criminal prosecution to pitch in on occasion. We asked Abbott’s office for information on the prosecutions he referred to in his commentary. Spokeswoman Lauren Bean emailed us a list of 104 prosecutions handled by the agency since Abbott became attorney general in late 2002. The AG’s office was the lead prosecutor in the vast majority of the cases, she told us by phone. The list included cases involving public officials from dog catcher (a child pornography case that ended in a guilty verdict) through higher city and county officials, tax assessors, sheriffs, justices of the peace, judges, assistant district attorneys and one former district attorney (who pleaded guilty to paying himself and others more than $2 million illegally while in office). Crimes involving child pornography and taking public funds are certainly violations of the public trust, though we also wondered how many of Abbott’s cases involved corruption like the examples he presented in his ""third-world"" speech: a former state district judge sentenced to six years in prison for his role in a cash-for-favors scheme, a former sheriff’s captain who took bribes from drug traffickers; and law enforcement officials who stole drugs and resold them to dealers. Abbott also noted in his Feb. 10 opinion piece that the Monitor had reported that ""cases of public officials on the take have spiked."" And, Abbott said, ""there have been other stories about law enforcement officers in other Texas counties involved in money laundering, drug smuggling and accepting bribes to protect the cartels and their smuggling routes."" Texas Penal Code Chapter 1, Section 1.09, says the attorney general’s office can aid county or district attorneys in prosecuting certain criminal offenses including misuse of state property or funds and abuse of office, according to the office’s website. Public corruption, bribery and abuse of office were specifically cited in some of Abbott’s prosecutions. We set aside those that did not immediately appear to relate to misusing a public office. Deleting DWI cases, child pornography or indecency, murder, assault/injury, sexual offenses and gambling left 61 prosecutions. Eleven of those 61 prosecutions cited theft by a public servant. Others fell into criminal offense categories including bribery, (breach of) public integrity, official oppression, election violations, fraud and abuse of official capacity, as well as misappropriation or misallocation of public funds or property. The type of case in one prosecution involving an assistant county auditor was specifically given as ""public corruption."" So certainly some of the prosecutions involved what ordinary citizens might regard as corruption. We sought expert advice. Two attorneys suggested it’s not easy to decide when a criminal case involves corruption in office. Director Gregg Cox of the Travis County district attorney’s special prosecutions division, which investigates allegations of wrongdoing by public officials, told us by email, ""There is no definition of ‘corruption’ in the Penal Code or Code of Criminal Procedure, and because the way that term is used can differ from office to office, I would just not be comfortable commenting on that."" George Dix, a criminal law expert and University of Texas law professor, said via email, ""I'm not sure what are 'corruption' cases. As far as I know, that is not a term of art. I suppose the term could mean a prosecution for a crime that requires proof of some official malfeasance."" Finally, we looked at whether the prosecutions occurred across Texas, as Abbott wrote, and at whether the prosecuted individuals included judges and district attorneys, as he said. The 104 prosecutions occurred in about one-fourth of Texas’ 254 counties -- six on the border and 193 scattered elsewhere across the state. Nine of Abbott’s public-official prosecutions involved a judge, assistant district attorney, county attorney and district attorney (at the time of his crimes). Four seemed not to be related to abuse of office: a child pornography case, two drunken-driving cases and one case involving misdemeanor offensive contact with an employee. The remaining five prosecutions: State v. David McCoy A Feb. 21, 2008, Amarillo Globe-News news story said, ""Suspended 100th District Court Judge David McCoy concluded an agreement with the state Attorney General's office Thursday afternoon that will prevent him from facing felony charges. … A Childress County Grand Jury indicted him on two felony indictments: abuse of official capacity and theft by a public servant."" News reports provided no additional detail. State v. Emil Karl Prohl An April 29, 2010, Facebook post by the Kerrville Daily Times said, ""Former 198th district judge Emil Karl Prohl has pled guilty to charges of misapplication of funds. He gets two years probation for taking double reimbursement for travel expenses out of several district and county accounts."" State vs. Joe Frank Garza A May 9, 2011, Corpus Christi Caller-Times news story said, ""Former 79th District Attorney Joe Frank Garza began serving a six-month stint behind bars on Monday for illegally paying himself and his employees more than $2 million from his office's drug forfeiture fund."" In re: Judge Christopher Dupuy A Sept. 19, 2013, Houston Chronicle news story said, ""A suspended Galveston judge pleaded guilty Thursday to two misdemeanors in exchange for two years of probation. County Court-at-Law Judge Christopher Dupuy pleaded guilty to abuse of office and perjury in exchange for two years of deferred adjudication. … The petition for removal accuses Dupuy of failing to obey an order from a state appeals court, abusing his authority by retaliating against attorneys and threatening the district clerk while attempting to interfere in his own divorce case."" State vs. Scott Tidwell An Oct. 5, 2011, Associated Press news story said, ""A former West Texas county attorney will spend four months in jail for retaliating against two nurses who made an anonymous complaint about a doctor to state medical regulators. … The nurses were fired from their jobs at a hospital in Kermit and charged with felonies."" Our ruling Abbott said, ""As attorney general, I have prosecuted judges, district attorneys and other public officials across Texas who violated that (public) trust, who have been corrupted."" During Abbott’s decade-plus as attorney general, his office has helped prosecute 104 cases against public officials across Texas -- 61 of them appearing to involve public corruption and five of those against judges, a county attorney and a DA.  We rate his statement as True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

Lawmaker: Studies show medical marijuana reduces seizures
","An important debate is ongoing in the Georgia Legislature concerning the use of a form of medical marijuana to treat certain forms of seizures. The state’s House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed House Bill 885, which would allow for the use of medical research cannabis in specific cases. The bill’s supporters are anxiously hoping the Georgia Senate will adopt the legislation. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s new Legislative Navigator gives it a 27 percent chance of passing this session. The bill’s primary sponsor, Rep. Allen Peake, R-Macon, offered what appeared to be a persuasive argument to support the legislation. ""(In Colorado), 100 percent of children have seen diminished seizure activity,"" Peake told fellow House members in the discussion before the bill was passed. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Peake’s statement was correct. Peake and other leading House Republicans did not plan to advocate this session on legislation that involves medical marijuana, particularly in an election year. Peake said he was persuaded to get involved after meeting a 4-year-old girl from his area named Haleigh Cox who suffers from a severe seizure disorder. Peake said he received the information he used to base his claim from the Realm of Caring, a Colorado-based organization that has attempted to provide care to patients suffering from cancer, AIDS, Parkinson’s disease and other conditions through the use of medicinal cannabis oil. Some Georgians have moved to Colorado to seek treatment for their children. Peake clarified his statement, saying that it was actually 98 percent of patients who had diminished seizure activity. Marijuana contains about 60 chemical components called cannabinoids. The cannabinoid that the bill’s proponents are considering is cannabidiol. It would be ingested and not smoked, the bill’s supporters say. It would not include THC, which is the element in cannabis that causes smokers to get high. The form of cannabidiol used at the Realm of Caring is named Charlotte’s Web, after a 5-year-old girl whose recovery from a rare condition is credited to the substance. Charlotte’s Web is a rich amber and as thick as cold honey. It smells like marijuana and tastes like raw plants. A month’s supply of the oil can cost $150 to $250, and some families say they receive financial help from nonprofit groups. Heather Jackson, the executive director of the Realm of Caring Foundation, said Peake was correct that every patient studied in the first set of tests, ""harvests"" is the term she used, had a reduction in seizures. The Realm of Caring is in its second harvest and has seen less than a handful of nonresponders, which accounts for Peake’s revised 98 percent total. The New York Times, though, reported in December that there is ""scattered medical research"" to substantiate claims cannabis oils helped reduce seizures, citing a 2012 study on the American Epilepsy Society’s website. Other researchers have also cautioned there is not enough research on its medicinal benefits. The American Epilepsy Society wants ""well-controlled studies"" it believes will lead to a better understanding of the effectiveness of cannabidiol and other forms of medical marijuana on epilepsy patients. Amy Brooks-Kayal, a Colorado-based neurology physician who is first vice president of the American Epilepsy Society, said there’s not enough information to determine what the dosage should be or how it interacts with other medicines. The AES, which claims about 3,500 members, said although cannabidiol offers hope, these are only anecdotal reports. Robust scientific evidence for the use of marijuana, it said, is lacking. ""There haven’t been good studies with cannabidiol with children with epilepsy,"" Brooks-Kayal said. The federal Food and Drug Administration has authorized trials of an established British drug, Epidolex, that comes from marijuana. Some experts who believe Epidolex is a better option say it’s unclear whether Charlotte’s Web is free of potentially harmful impurities. Jackson offered us two studies in defense of the treatment. In one study, all 11 children studied showed a reduction in weekly motor-type seizures, the study concluded. After three months, five of the 11 children were seizure-free, the study found. The paper, introduced at the American Epilepsy Society’s annual meeting in December, acknowledged the sample size was small. In the other study, two Stanford University researchers asked parents whose children were using cannabidiol to fill out a survey detailing its impact on their children. Sixteen of the 19 parents reported reduced seizure frequency. Three parents said their children were free of seizures. The most often reported side effects were better mood, increased alertness, better sleep and drowsiness. Common side effects with other forms of treatment were not found, the parents said. Jackson said 13 of those 19 parents had children who were using Charlotte’s Web. Jackson said they are doing more research. Jackson, whose son has used the treatment, said in the cases in which Charlotte’s Web did not result in fewer seizures for the patient, ""there is less than a 1 percent chance that a child in this intractable epilepsy population will find one that will work."" Charlotte’s Web, she said, has performed better than other forms of treatment. ""There is not a treatment in the world that will work for all,"" Jackson told us. ""However, it is important to note that there is not a pharmaceutical in the world that works for even 5 percent of the epilepsy population. So the numbers are quite staggering actually."" Peake said he was not deterred by questions or concerns about the research. ""The anecdotal evidence is so strong that a parent, in conjunction with their doctor, should have the personal choice to make that decision,"" Peake said. To sum up, Peake said ""every child in Colorado"" who has been given medical marijuana for treatment for seizures has had diminished seizure activity. Peake then said it’s actually 98 percent, citing newer data. There are very few studies out there. They do show medical marijuana has a positive impact on seizure activity. But not at the levels Peake said. His statement is partially accurate. But it needs a lot of context to be fully understood. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FCDF00>],/factchecks/2014/mar/11/allen-peake/lawmaker-studies-show-medical-marijuana-reduces-se/

Ted Cruz says Barack Obama is first president 'who thinks he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore'
","Critics of President Barack Obama have charged that he has regularly exceeded the powers of his office in selectively enforcing the law. Their examples include making recess appointments, issuing executive orders, delaying provisions of his health care law, refusing to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in court and declining to deport certain categories of young illegal immigrants. At the 2014 CPAC conference, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, reiterated this point to the audience of conservative activists. Referring to Obama, Cruz said, ""This president of the United States is the first president we've ever had who thinks he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore."" We were suspicious of this claim, because we recalled several instances in recent years of other presidents being accused of exceeding their executive authority. We checked with eight historians and legal scholars across the ideological spectrum to see whether they could point to prior examples of presidents choosing to ignore laws. They came up with a number of examples. (Cruz’s office did not return an inquiry for this story.) While Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he believes Obama is ""setting records for the number, scope, and creativity of unconstitutional and illegal behavior,"" he acknowledged that ""Obama wasn't the first president to violate the law and won't be the last."" Here’s a trip down memory lane to review just some of the instances in which presidents are believed to have acted in ways that ignored existing legal or constitutional limits: • Abraham Lincoln. During the Civil War era, Lincoln ""broke an assortment of laws and ignored one constitutional provision after another,"" according to an analysis by the Miller Center at the University of Virginia. Lincoln waged war without a congressional declaration of war (or even a Congress in session to declare one), spent $2 million to raise an army without congressional appropriation, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, and issued the Emancipation Proclamation, among other actions. ""Following a strategy of ‘unilateral action,’ Lincoln justified his powers as an emergency authority granted to him by the people,"" the Miller Center analysis concludes. ""He had been elected, he told his critics, to decide when an emergency existed and to take all measures required to deal with it. In doing so, Lincoln maintained that the President was one of three ‘coordinate’ departments of government, not in any way subordinate to Congress or the courts."" • Andrew Johnson. After the Civil War ended and Lincoln was assassinated, Andrew Johnson became president and almost immediately clashed with Congress over how to treat the former Confederacy. Edwin M. Stanton, who had been Secretary of War under Lincoln, retained his position under Johnson and became one of the new president’s biggest critics, asserting that the federal government should intervene more forcefully to protect freed slaves’ rights in the South. In 1867, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, which required Senate approval before a president fired federal officials who had originally been confirmed by the Senate. When Johnson tried to oust Stanton, the Senate blocked him; when Johnson made a second ouster attempt, the House impeached him. (Johnson ultimately survived impeachment, Stanton resigned, and the Tenure of Office Act was repealed in 1887.) • Franklin Delano Roosevelt. On March 11, 1941, as World War II was already under way in Europe -- and while the United States was still officially on the sidelines -- Roosevelt signed a landmark law known as the Lend-Lease Act. At the time, Britain was under siege and almost out of money, so the law authorized the president to sell, lease, or lend military hardware to any country he designated as vital to American national security. However, a provision in the law would have allowed Congress to terminate the president’s powers after a certain amount of time through a ""concurrent resolution."" This amounted to a ""legislative veto"" by a simple majority and without the president’s signature. Roosevelt believed this to be unconstitutional, but he signed the bill anyway, secretly writing a  memorandum to Attorney General Robert H. Jackson explaining that ""the emergency was so great that I signed the bill in spite of a clearly unconstitutional provision contained in it."" Jackson only made the episode public in 1953. • Harry Truman. In the midst of the Korean War, Truman had to grapple with labor disputes within the steel industry -- a sector he considered vital to the war effort. In a bid to head off a looming work stoppage, Truman in 1952 ordered his Commerce Secretary to seize the steel mills. The industry objected, and Truman’s seizure was ultimately ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in the case Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer. • Richard Nixon. Citing government spending as a reason for surging inflation, Nixon refused to spend nearly $12 billion of congressionally appropriated funds for 1973 and 1974. He did so under an executive action known as ""impoundment"" -- an action that had been used by many presidents previously, but with questionable constitutionality. Faced with Nixon’s unusually large impoundment -- and with the president bogged down in Watergate -- Congress rebelled, passing legislation to make impoundment illegal. Nixon vetoed the bill, Congress overrode his veto, and Nixon stood his ground. The administration challenged the new law barring impoundment, but a federal court sided with Congress, saying impoundment was unconstitutional. • Ronald Reagan. Reagan’s quest to fight communism suffered a setback in the middle of his first term when the Democratic Congress in 1983 passed the Boland Amendment, which restricted the CIA and the Defense Department from operating in Nicaragua. An even stronger version passed the following year. The Reagan administration diverted some of the proceeds of a secret arms sale to Iran to the anti-communist militia in Nicaragua known as the Contras, an action that directly violated the Boland Amendment. Several top advisers to Reagan were implicated in what became known as the Iran-Contra affair. While the Reagan-appointed Tower Commission said Reagan's disengagement from White House management had made the diversion possible, Reagan himself was never formally linked to the violation of the Boland amendment. • George W. Bush. While president, Bush issued 161 signing statements -- that is, official pronouncements that accompany the signing of a bill into law. In addition to commenting on the law generally, signing statements have been used to document the president’s constitutional objections to provisions contained in the law, and sometimes to announce how (or whether) parts of the law will be enforced. Bush was hardly the first to issue signing statements, but he was the most prolific. According to the Congressional Research Service, Bush issued 161 signing statements, which is a smaller number than each of his three immediate predecessors. But 79 percent of Bush’s statements -- a much higher rate -- noted a challenge or objection to the law being signed, rather than offering relatively innocuous comments. Meanwhile, many statements contained multiple reservations, making the total number more than 1,000. The American Bar Association published a report asserting that Bush’s statements were ""contrary to the rule of law and our constitutional separation of powers"" when they ""claim the authority or state the intention to disregard or decline to enforce all or part of a law ... or to interpret such a law in a manner inconsistent with the clear intent of Congress."" Like Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt before him, Bush ""asserted the power to violate certain laws if necessary to defend the country,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. ""Bush’s signing statements typically said that he would interpret laws restricting executive authority, such as a law forbidding cruel and inhumane treatment of detainees, in a manner consistent with his understanding of his power as commander-in-chief. What that meant, it turned out when the memos were declassified, was that the law did not bind him if he believed certain actions were necessary to national security — the ‘commander-in-chief override.’ "" Our ruling We found that at least seven presidents -- including some of the nation’s most admired occupants of the White House -- acted, at least on occasion, in ways that ignored specific laws or constitutional protections. It is not accurate to say, as Cruz does, that Obama would be ""the first president we've ever had who thinks he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore."" Presidents have done so frequently, and historians expect that they will continue to do so. We rate the claim False. *** EDITOR’S NOTE, March 11, 2014: After we published our story, Cruz’s office provided the following response: ""Since the dawn of the republic, the president and Congress have resisted attempts from each other to encroach upon their constitutional powers. Many presidents have asserted, and have abused, executive authority. No one is arguing that President Obama is the first to make this mistake. As Sen. Cruz has detailed in three reports, a Wall Street Journal op-ed, and a brief before the U.S. Supreme Court, no president until President Obama has ever claimed the authority to ignore the explicit text of statutes passed by Congress and unilaterally replace that text with whatever the president wishes. From Obamacare to immigration, to same sex marriage, to marijuana laws, President Obama’s willingness to ignore or alter law is unquestionably outside the scope of executive power. It amounts to legislating, pure and simple."" However, we don’t agree that there’s a significant distinction between ""abus(ing) executive authority"" and a ""willingness to ignore or alter law,"" so we feel comfortable with the historical examples we used to analyze Cruz’s statement. We’re standing by our original ruling of False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3D9200>],/factchecks/2014/mar/10/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-barack-obama-first-president-who-thi/
"['Recreation', 'Virginia', 'Barbara Comstock']","
Barbara Comstock says Democrats flip-flopped on bicycle tailgating bill
","Republican Del. Barbara Comstock says five U-turning Democrats ran over her bicycle safety bill in the state Senate last month. Comstock, who represents Fairfax County and is running for the 10th District congressional seat being vacated by Republican Frank Wolf, complained on her campaign’s Facebook page. ""Democrat senators were for my bipartisan ‘following too closely’ bicycle bill (HB 82) before they were against it!"" she wrote on Feb. 21. ""It was the same bill that Democrat senators voted for last year but this year, after I got it through the House (unlike the previous House patron) the senate killed it! Welcome to the new Democrat-controlled Virginia Senate."" Comstock was referring to the Senate Transportation Committee’s 9-5 vote on Feb. 19 to kill her bill that would have made it illegal for a motorist to tailgate a bicycle. Two of Comstock’s political supporters posted Facebook replies accusing the Democrats of switching to undermine Comstock in her congressional race. A third supporter urged to her reveal the flip floppers. So Comstock posted the names of five Democrats: Sens. Creigh Deeds of Bath County, Henry Marsh of Richmond, Ken Alexander of Norfolk, Phil Puckett of Russell County and John Miller of Newport News. Records show that each of the five did vote to kill the bill. So we looked into Comstock’s claim each changed his previous position. Comstock’s one-paragraph bill would have barred motorists from following bicycles ""more closely than is reasonable and prudent."" In recent years, bills with the same language have passed the House and Senate, but they’ve never been able to muster a majority vote from both chambers during the same year and make it to the governor’s desk. Last year, the Senate passed an anti-tailgating bill containing an additional provision that would have extended the 2-foot width motorists must allow when passing bicyclists to 3 feet. Deeds, Alexander, Puckett and Miller supported the legislation. Marsh voted against the measure. Marsh, however, did support legislation in 2012 that solely contained the tailgating provision. So did Deeds, Puckett and Miller. Alexander was not in the Senate that year and did not cast a ballot on the bill. We asked the Democrats why they changed their votes this year. Marsh and Deeds emailed that they were swayed by questions about the bill’s enforceability that were raised at a hearing last month by Sen. Charles Carrico Sr., R-Grayson. Carrico, a former state trooper, said issuing a tailgating ticket is a judgement call by police that’s tough to make stick in court unless there’s been an accident. ""I do not recall hearing this discussion in past years when I voted for similar legislation,"" Marsh wrote. Deeds emailed, ""I always reserve the right to be smarter today than I was yesterday."" Alexander told us that before his vote in favor of the measure last year, he hadn’t had the benefit of sitting through a committee hearing on the law because he was new to the Senate and had not received his assignments. After hearing the committee debate this year, Alexander said he had concerns about how police would apply the ""necessary and prudent"" standard for following bicyclists. After voting to kill the measure on Feb. 19, Alexander asked the Transportation Committee to reconsider the bill to see if his colleagues would be willing to replace the ""necessary and prudent"" following distance with an exact measurement. The panel took the bill up and killed it a second time on Feb. 26, this time with Alexander voting in the minority. We reached out to Miller and Puckett about their changed votes, but didn’t hear back. It should be noted that backpedaling on bicycle tailgating bill is a bipartisan sport. Comstock’s list of Senate defectors included two Republicans who opposed tailgating legislation this year and supported it last year: Steve Newman of Lynchburg and Ralph Smith of Botetourt County. We should also note that the vote tallies were evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. Of the nine senators that voted to kill the measure five were Democrats and four were Republicans. Our ruling Comstock said a group of Senate Democrats once backed the language of her bike tailgating bill but now oppose it. She correctly identified five Democrats who changed their position, leading to the defeat on her bill this year. Although Comstock directed her ire at the Democrats, she did note that two Republican senators also switched positions this year. We rate her statement True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973AEAC0>],/factchecks/2014/mar/10/barbara-comstock/barabara-comstock-says-democrats-flip-flopped-bicy/
"['Debt', 'Deficit', 'Income', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'We Are Wisconsin ']","
Despite $1 billion surplus, group says Scott Walker raising state deficit while borrowing is at record high
","Many times Gov. Scott Walker has proclaimed that he has solved the state government’s budget problems. But his political opponents are not willing to cede the fiscal-conservative ground to him. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke has gone after Walker on this score, and on Feb. 17, 2014, she was joined by We Are Wisconsin, a union-backed group. In a mass email, the group criticized the Republican governor’s plan to cut  income and property taxes. The group also made a claim by posing a question: ""Irresponsible. What else can you say about increasing the state deficit at a time when borrowing is already at record levels?"" For several weeks before the group made its claim, the news out of Madison was that the state expects a budget surplus approaching $1 billion. So, how is it that Walker is adding to a deficit? Is state borrowing at a record level? And, as importantly, is there a connection between the two? Surplus/deficit Let’s begin with the property and income tax cuts. After action by the state Assembly and Senate, they appeared, as of early March 2014, likely to become law. Walker proposed the cuts after the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau in mid-January 2014 projected that the state will see, mostly as a result of higher-than-expected tax collections, a $977 million surplus by the time the current two-year budget cycle ends in June 2015. So, how is it that there is talk of a deficit? When we asked We Are Wisconsin for evidence to back its claim, the group said it was using ""deficit"" as shorthand for ""structural deficit."" But the two are different things. The structural deficit isn’t a measure of any deficit of funds in the current state budget. Rather, as calculated by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the structural deficit is a rough estimate of how tax and spending commitments will line up during the next budget period -- in this case, for 2015-’17. So -- and this is an important point in this context -- we’re not talking about red ink like there is at the federal level, where the U.S. government adopts a budget with a deficit and then meets the difference by borrowing money that piles up as the national debt. In October 2013, after the state’s 2013-’15 budget was adopted, the fiscal bureau projected the structural deficit would be $725 million in 2015-’17. In January 2014, after Walker proposed the income and property tax cuts, thus reducing revenue, the fiscal bureau raised its structural deficit projection to $807 million. It’s worth noting that an $807 million structural deficit is relatively small. When Walker took office in January 2011, the 2011-’13 structural deficit exceeded $2.6 billion. Both Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, and Jon Peacock, head of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families’ Wisconsin Budget Project, said that since the term structural deficit doesn’t measure an actual deficit, a better term might be structural imbalance. That is, there is a projection that expenditures will exceed revenue down the road, which could create a deficit. But when the state fiscal bureau makes the projection, it does not attempt to estimate how much tax collections might grow. So, it’s possible that revenue growth, such as in the current budget cycle, will mean there is no actual deficit in the next budget cycle. So, it’s true that because Walker proposed property and income tax cuts, the structural deficit going into 2015-’17 is higher than it would have been if the 2013-’15 budget had simply remained in place. But that is not the same as saying the state has an actual deficit and that the deficit will increase. The debt Now let's look at the state debt and what connection it has to the structural deficit. To build roads and do other large-scale projects, the state takes on debt. The rationale for it is well understood: Costs can be spread out over years, so that future users of a new highway, for example, help pay the tab for building it. Borrowing, instead of paying cash for a major project, can also alleviate the need for a tax increase. However, debt can increase in other ways, too. Governors have responded to a structural deficit by, for example, restructuring debt payments to free up more money in exchange for extending debt payments further into the future. Or by moving money that had been segregated for transportation projects to the general fund and, in turn, borrowing more money for transportation projects. We Are Wisconsin cited a September 2013 fact-check we did that found that, in the first year of the current biennium -- 2013-’14 -- the state would allocate $738 million in general tax dollars toward debt payments. That’s 5.26 percent of general revenue and, according to the fiscal bureau, the highest such percentage on record. The figures for 2014-’15 are lower -- $708 million and 4.88 percent. As for the total amount of debt the state currently has -- most of which was accumulated before Walker -- that is also at a record level, exceeding $14 billion.    But, to repeat, the state's structural deficit and its debt aren't directly connected. It's not as if an increase in the structural deficit -- which is a projection not actual red ink -- automatically increases the state's debt.   Our rating We Are Wisconsin stated that, with his proposal to cut income and property taxes, Walker is ""increasing the state deficit at a time when borrowing is already at record levels."" The statement contains an element of truth in that state borrowing is at an all-time high -- but, flush with a nearly $1 billion surplus, it’s clear the state does not have a budget deficit. Moreover, an increase in the ""structural deficit"" -- a projection of a possible imbalance of expenditures and revenues in the future -- has no direct relation to how much the state borrows.

"['Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Labor', 'Legal Issues', 'Kenneth Block']","
Ken Block says that under a bill before the R.I. legislature, “you’d have to go to court to fire an employee.”
","In his campaign for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, Kenneth Block has been arguing that a big reason why Rhode Island’s economy is stagnant is that the state has too many laws, rules and regulations that increase costs and impede the ability of businesses to rapidly respond to changing conditions. In a March 2 appearance on WJAR-10’s ""News Conference"" Block cited as an example  a bill introduced in the General Assembly this session that he said would interfere with an employer’s ability to dismiss employees. ""We had a legislator put in a bill to remove the ability of an employer to fire an employee, it’d end up in court, you’d have to go to court to fire an employee,"" he said. We wanted to see if Block had just cause to make that claim. We called Block’s campaign and they promptly identified the proposed legislation, House Bill 7055, introduced in January by state Rep. K. Joseph Shekarchi, D-Warwick. The bill would add language to the state law on employee rights stating that no employee in the state can be fired if the dismissal is against ""an explicit, well established public policy of the state"" or if the employee ""has an implied contractual right to employment."" Those phrases are significant because, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Rhode Island is one of only three states (Florida and Georgia are the other two) that are known as ""at-will"" employment states. ""‘At will’ means an employee can be discharged at any time, for good reason, bad reason or no reason at all,"" said Michael J. Yelnosky, dean of the Roger Williams University Law School and an employment law specialist. He said the only limit on ability to fire is if the reason is explicitly against the law, such a racial discrimination. He said Shekarchi’s bill wouldn’t prevent an employer from firing an employee. What it would do, he said, is give a dismissed employee two possible arguments that could be used in a subsequent lawsuit to overturn the firing. An employee might claim he was fired because he refused to do something that was against the law. Or, he might argue there was an implied contract, if, for example, the employer had repeatedly promised the employee he’d always have a job, Yelnosky said. In other words, the bill would make it easier for a fired employee to file a lawsuit to try to get his job back. We contacted Block’s campaign and they referred us to a Jan. 16 news release Block issued on Shekarchi’s bill. In that statement, Block said if the bill passed ""it would give every terminated employee the opportunity to claim that he or she had an implied contractual right to keep the job."" Block campaign policy director Matthew Schweich said the March 2  ""News Conference"" statement was ""a simplified version of the original statement."" Not exactly. On ""News Conference,""  Block said an employer would have to go to court to fire an employee. And that’s just not true. Nothing in the bill prevents a firing or requires an employer to get preliminary judicial approval. If Block had stuck to his better-worded news release, he’d have been right. We rule Block’s statement False. (Correction: Matthew Schweich is the policy director for the Block campaign. The initial version of this item incorrectly identified him as the campaign manager.)",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2C09C0>],/factchecks/2014/mar/10/kenneth-block/ken-block-says-under-bill-ri-legislature-youd-have/
"['Foreign Policy', 'PunditFact', 'Dick Cheney']","
Dick Cheney says 'a lot' of allies backed Syrian air strike
","The Republican storyline on the crisis in Crimea ties Russian aggression to foreign policy mistakes by President Barack Obama. Former Vice President Dick Cheney pressed this interpretation of events in an interview on CBS’s Face the Nation. ""We have created an image around the world, not just for the Russians, of weakness, of indecisiveness,"" Cheney said. ""The Syrian situation is a classic. We got all ready to do something. A lot of the allies signed on. At the last minute, Obama backed off."" Cheney obviously thought Syria was a telling example, because he came back and said it again a few moments later. International support for military intervention in Syria was a muddy business, and we thought we should look at where America’s allies stood after chemical weapons were used in Syria. Were ""a lot of them ready to go""? We reached out to Cheney, via the Republican National Committee, to learn which allies he had in mind. The RNC made an effort but we did not hear back before we published. A quick recap In August 2012, President Obama told reporters that the United States had no plans to use military force against Syria but ""a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus."" A year later, an attack on an opposition-held suburbs on the outskirts of Damascus brought matters to a head. The bodies brought into hospitals and the illness that struck the doctors and nurses that treated the victims pointed to the use of chemical weapons. The attack took place on Aug. 21 and within a week, the administration was talking about launching air strikes at weapon depots and military command centers in Syria. Under the best of circumstances for the White House, any such military action would come with some sort of endorsement from the United Nations Security Council and the participation of America’s key European and Middle Eastern allies. Who signed on and who didn’t Both France and Britain were early supporters of a limited air strike. French President Francois Hollande said, ""France is ready to punish those who took the heinous decision to gas innocents."" British Prime Minister David Cameron said the international response should be legal and proportionate, while a top official was quoted as saying it was ""reasonable to assume our armed forces are making contingency plans."" But while Cameron was counted among those ready to attack, the British parliament took a different view. At the end of August, dozens of members of Cameron’s own party deserted him, and a motion to back the use of force failed by 13 votes. It was an unprecedented loss for a prime minister, and Cameron said he would cancel a military deployment that had already begun. Support among the other European states was equally hard to find. Italy said it would only go along if the U.N. Security Council approved the use of force. Germany was seen as a pivotal player and was clearly against military action. With opinion polls showing over 60 percent of Germans favoring diplomacy over force, and elections just a few weeks away, the German government stopped well short of endorsing a military response. Germany signed on to a G20 statement that called the use of poisonous gas a war crime and said the Syrian government was the likely culprit. But having said that, the statement added, ""The EU underscores at the same time the need to move forward with addressing the Syrian crisis through the U.N. process."" The role of the United Nations was critical because the strongest legal justification for an air strike would come through the U.N. Security Council. That was impossible since two permanent members, Russia and China, had made it clear they would veto any such resolution. The strongest support within NATO came from Turkey. In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia was the most eager to see an attack on Syria, a long-time political foe. Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were also on board. However, the Arab League never approved a military strike. As the White House aimed to muster international backing, it looked for ways to maintain a sense of momentum. On Sept. 6, it released a joint statement from Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The statement called for ""a strong international response to this grave violation of the world’s rules and conscience that will send a clear message that this kind of atrocity can never be repeated. Those who perpetrated these crimes must be held accountable."" However, the nature of ""a strong international response"" was left undefined. At one point, the administration said 25 nations had signed on but that did not mean they all endorsed air strikes. Ultimately, even France said it wanted to wait for a final report from U.N. chemical weapons inspectors. By mid September, the United States and Russia had struck a deal that sidelined the use of force in exchange for Syria giving up its chemical weapons. That process is underway but is behind schedule. Our ruling Cheney said a lot of allies ""got ready to go"" on Syria and ""signed on,"" but Obama backed out. Actually, very few American allies were ""ready to go."" We counted France, Turkey and Saudi Arabia as countries that were supportive. And France’s support seemed to wane as time went on. Among the ""no"" crowd were key allies like the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. In fact, the United Kingdom’s parliament offered an embarrassing rebuke to Cameron when it blocked British participation. The Arab League did not endorse the military action, nor did the United Nations. Obama has said he declined to pursue military action because Syria agreed to weapons inspections. There’s no dispute that for whatever reason, military action was not pursued in Syria. But Cheney was re-writing history when he said ""a lot of the allies signed on.""

Rand Paul says Obama lost youth support
","Talk of Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., as a 2016 presidential candidate picked up steam over the weekend after he bested other potential party nominees in a Conservative Political Action Conference straw poll, pulling in support from 31 percent of attendees who voted. On Fox News Sunday, he criticized President Barack Obama’s inability to retain support among young voters, suggesting that Republicans such as himself could pick up more of the demographic’s support. ""The president won the youth vote three to one, but his numbers have dropped 20, 30 percent among the youth,"" Paul said. ""Really, the public at large is less trusting of this president, but the youth in particular have lost faith in this president. And so I think there’s a real opportunity for Republicans who do believe in the Fourth Amendment to grow our party by attracting young people and bring that energy into our party."" Let’s take a look at how Obama has fared with young voters. According to 2008 exit polls, Obama took home 66 percent of the youth vote, which includes voters aged 18 to 29. In 2012, that number decreased to 60 percent, still a commanding majority of the demographic. That means the 3 to 1 ratio Paul cited is off base. Yes, Obama easily won the youth vote in both races. But he won it by roughly a 2 to 1 ratio in 2008 and a 3 to 2 ratio in 2012. Paul’s office specified that he was referring to a difference in percentage points when we cited a 20 to 30 percent drop in Obama’s youth support, but his statement reads like he was referring to percent change. We’ll crunch the numbers both ways. To gauge Obama’s recent approval ratings among young voters, Paul’s spokesman pointed us to a December 2013 report from the Harvard University Institute of Politics. Every six months, the nonpartisan institute surveys about 2,000 18- to 29-year-olds on political issues. Harvard reported that in surveys conducted in October and November 2013, 41 percent of young voters approved of Obama’s performance as president, while 54 percent disapproved. Participants answered right as the Affordable Care Act online marketplaces went through a rocky rollout. That’s the lowest approval rating the institute charted since the start of his presidency, a 14-percentage-point drop from November 2009. As a percentage of his support, it’s just over a 20 percent drop. We also looked at approval ratings reported by Gallup, a nonpartisan polling group. When Obama first took office in 2009, three-quarters of young voters polled approved of him. Although the percentage ebbs and flows from week to week, the general trend points downward. In 2014, the approval rating for the same demographic has hovered just over 40 percent. It’s a significant drop in Obama support from young voters, as Paul pointed out. Using Gallup’s numbers for the week of Feb. 24, the most recently reported, we get a decrease of 32 percentage points. That means that relative to his starting point, he suffered a 40-percent drop. That said, Democrats still have a stronger grip on young voters than Republicans. According to the Harvard survey, 33 percent of young voters considered themselves Democrats, compared with 24 percent Republicans and 44 percent independents. Our ruling Paul said, ""The president won the youth vote three to one, but his numbers have dropped 20, 30 percent among the youth."" Obama won the youth vote in both elections, but the ratios were  smaller than 2 to 1, so Paul’s math is off. Approval ratings among young voters have indeed dropped since 2009, by as much as Paul said or more when we consider percent change. Overall, it’s clear that Obama is falling in favorability with young voters. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809781B380>],/factchecks/2014/mar/09/rand-paul/sen-paul-says-obama-lost-youth-support/
"['New Hampshire', 'Health Care', 'Jobs', 'Ann McLane Kuster']","
Did Ann Kuster flip-flop on employer mandates in Affordable Care Act?
","When Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster, D-N.H., sat down recently for an interview on New Hampshire Public Radio, the conversation quickly turned to President Barack Obama’s health care law. Kuster said she’s dead set against repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, but she agreed that it should be revised -- particularly in areas that affect small businesses. Kuster said she wants to reexamine guidelines that define a ""full-time"" work week as being as little as 30 hours, and also supports Obama’s decision to further delay the so-called ""employer mandate."" The employer mandate is a provision in the health reform law that requires businesses with 50 or more employees to offer affordable insurance coverage for workers or face penalties. The federal government was set to begin enforcing that aspect of the law in 2014, but the Obama administration has pushed back the deadline twice, moving it to 2016. Kuster said delaying the employer mandate will provide an opportunity for New Hampshire’s insurance exchange to get more competition that could drive down costs. ""That’s one reason that I support the president in the delay of the small business mandate for another year,"" she said. ""Get more competition into the New Hampshire marketplace and then we’ll find that there will be insurers that will compete on convenience as compared to cost."" Kuster’s remarks on NHPR drew fire from the National Republican Congressional Committee, which said Kuster’s statement was at odds with her voting record. That’s because in July 2013, Kuster voted against a House bill that called for delaying the employer mandate. In a blog post, NRCC spokesman Ian Prior wrote that Kuster either lied or has ""absolutely no idea what she is voting for."" Kuster did vote against the bill. But does that mean that Kuster has reversed her position on the employer mandate, as NRCC claims? Shifting dates The politics surrounding any vote on the House floor is complex. In this case, by the time last year’s vote was held, the Obama administration had already announced it would postpone enforcing the employer mandate for one year. So the vote was essentially symbolic. The White House’s preemptive move left some House Republicans peeved, since Obama made the change through his executive authority, rather than by going through Congress. In response, House Republican leaders devised a series of showdown votes aimed at driving a wedge between Democrats and the White House. For instance, Republicans called a vote on delaying the employer mandate, even though the change had already taken place. They also introduced a second bill to delay the health care law’s mandate on individuals to secure health insurance. Democratic leaders called these measures further attempts to dismantle Obamacare. Obama threatened to veto the bills, specifically calling H.R. 2667 -- the bill delaying the employer mandate -- ""unnecessary."" Despite such calls from the Democratic leadership, House Republicans picked up some Democratic support for the measure. It passed, 264-161, with 35 Democrats voting for it. (The bill delaying the individual mandate also passed the House, though with less Democratic support.) Kuster’s stand Kuster voted against both bills, saying they undermined implementation of the health care law. But at the time, Kuster didn’t specifically address the merits of delaying the employer mandate. By contrast, U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter -- another New Hampshire Democrat who voted against both bills -- spelled out her opposition in greater detail. ""H.R. 2667 is unnecessary and redundant because President Obama already delayed the employer responsibility provision for one year; a provision that affects only 4 percent of all businesses in America,"" Shea-Porter said. We asked Kuster’s office for the congresswoman’s views on the employer mandate. Spokeswoman Rosie Hilmer said Kuster supported the president’s decision to delay the mandate in 2013, but voted against the Republican bill because it was a ""symbolic bill that would not have helped a single business."" ""Congresswoman Kuster takes her votes very seriously and addresses bills on their value, so she voted against this unnecessary bill because it was a redundant, meaningless stunt by House Republicans, not a serious attempt to address and fix problems with the law,"" Hilmer wrote. Our ruling Kuster recently said she supports the president’s move to delay the small business mandate for another year, saying the delay would provide more time for the New Hampshire marketplace to develop competition among health plans. Critics say that’s a contrast with her vote against a House bill to delay the employer mandate. We agree that there is a contrast between those two positions, but there’s also some nuance. Kuster didn’t say she opposed the bill because she thought that delaying the employer mandate was a bad idea -- a position that would have been a clear contrast with her more recent position. Rather, she voted against it because the bill was symbolic and tantamount to a stunt, since the White House had already delayed that provision of the law. We rate Kuster’s position on the employer mandate a Half Flip.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2B0280>],/factchecks/2014/mar/07/ann-mclane-kuster/ann-kuster/
"['Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'Florida', 'Will Weatherford']","
Will Weatherford says about half the people eligible for Medicaid expansion 'can buy a health care plan for $30 a month'
","Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford has been a vocal opponent of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. He’s no fan of the law’s proposed Medicaid expansion, especially. During an interview with the Tampa Bay Times editorial board on Feb. 27, Weatherford played down the need for Medicaid expansion, which the Legislature rejected last year. He said many Floridians who might have enrolled under an expanded Medicaid system can now buy affordable private insurance from the federal website HealthCare.gov. ""If you live above the 100 percent of the poverty rate today, which is about 400,000 of the 800,000 who would qualify for Medicaid expansion, half of the people who qualify for Medicaid expansion today can buy a health care plan for $30 a month on the exchange,"" he said. Weatherford added that he thought people in that income range ""should be able to afford $30 a month and have some skin in the game."" We wondered if half of the people who would have been eligible under a potential Medicaid expansion could get a private insurance plan for $30 a month. We ran the numbers and found that Weatherford had a point that many people who would have been eligible for Medicaid can buy plans from healthcare.gov for $30 a month. But it’s not half of them, it’s a good bit less. Showing you why is going to involve a deep dive into how the health care law works. Medicaid math The federal government offered to pay all the costs initially for states to expand Medicaid, a health insurance program for the poor, and 90 percent in later years. But Florida opted not to expand coverage. Just how many people would have been covered under the potential Florida expansion is hard to gauge. Estimates put it at about 1.3 million. The government uses the federal poverty level as the measure to determine a person’s eligibility to receive assistance for government programs such as Medicaid and, in the case of the Affordable Care Act, eligibility for insurance subsidies. For 2014, the poverty level is set at $11,670 for a single person and $23,850 for a family of four. Florida’s Medicaid program has more than 3 million enrollees, but many residents don’t qualify under the program’s guidelines. Some people, like young adults and parents, have to be at 22 percent of the Federal Poverty Level or below to qualify, but most single adults without children don’t qualify for Medicaid at all. The federal law intended to allow all poor adults into the program, but Florida opted not to expand the program. Who gets tax credits? The federal health care law intended for the very poor to get Medicaid and for low-wage workers to get tax credits to buy private insurance. The law splits those groups up by income, using definitions based on the federal poverty level. People who make 138 percent of the poverty level or lower would be eligible for Medicaid. People who make between 138 percent and 400 percent of the poverty level would get subsidies to buy private insurance on sites like HealthCare.gov. It doesn’t work like that in Florida, though, because the state chose not to expand Medicaid. In states that don’t expand Medicaid, the law also allows people making between 100 and 138 percent of the poverty level to shop for private insurance with subsidies. (Why that’s the case is another complicated story, which we will address in a separate report.) Weatherford is right that those people can buy insurance on the exchange. So how much will it cost them? The president’s health care law keeps premium costs low for households making up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level by providing tax credits to purchase insurance. The size of the tax credit is adjusted based on the cost of the second-least expensive silver option available in the marketplace. (Plans can be bronze, silver, gold or platinum, with the most generous -- and expensive -- plans being platinum.) Break out your calculators: The second-cheapest silver plan can only cost 2 percent of an individual’s annual income for households making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. For a person making $16,104, that’s an annual premium of $322, or $26 a month. By plugging demographic and salary information into HealthCare.gov, we can see how this rule bears out. For example, a 35-year-old single man living in Pinellas County and making $16,104 a year (138 percent of the federal poverty level) is ""eligible for a premium tax credit"" of up to $198 a month, according to HealthCare.gov. That individual could find a Bronze level plan from Humana for $0 a month (yes, zero dollars), albeit with a $6,300 deductible. He could also buy six other plans from various providers for $30 a month or less. What about a family of four (two adults and two children under 18) living in Miami-Dade County making exactly 100 percent the federal poverty level, or $23,850 a year? The children may be eligible for Medicaid through the Children’s Health Insurance Program, HealthCare.gov says. The parents would have to buy insurance on the federal marketplace, but they would be eligible for a tax credit of up to $712 a month. With the tax credit, there are several Bronze options that would cost nothing, but the deductible would be capped at $12,600 a year. There are eight other options for less than $30 a month. Those individuals would also be eligible for co-payment assistance, which is available to individuals and families making up to 250 percent of the federal poverty level. It’s not as good of a deal for those individuals as Medicaid would have been, which basically costs nothing for recipients, but Weatherford is right they could find coverage for pretty cheap. But what if you’re a family of four making $12,599 a year,  just one dollar less than the federal poverty level? The parents would no longer be eligible for any financial assistance toward their premiums. The same plans that would cost nothing to the family making $12,600, now cost $555 a month or more. Rachel Garfield, a senior researcher for the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health care research group, said those individuals making less than 100 percent the federal poverty level would likely be stuck in a situation where they couldn’t afford coverage and would remain uninsured. The law says they cannot be penalized for not having insurance, because affordable coverage is not available to them. Other estimates So Weatherford is correct that some people can buy insurance for cheap on the federal marketplace. But is it half of the people who would have been covered by a Medicaid expansion? Greg Mellowe, director of health research and analysis at the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, said it appeared the speaker had gotten confused about his numbers. Mellowe cited a Kaiser Family Foundation study that said there are about 1.3 million uninsured Floridians making 138 percent of the federal poverty level or less. Of those people, about one-third earn enough to buy cheap coverage on the marketplace. In another study released in August 2012, the Urban Institute also found almost 1.3 million people would be eligible in an expansion. Of those, 300,000 had income between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about 23 percent, and would be eligible to buy in the marketplace. Weatherford’s office told us his numbers were based on an estimate from staff analysts projecting that about 937,000 Floridians would be eligible under an expansion. Of those, about 314,000 were between 100 and 138 percent, meaning they now can buy insurance on the federal exchange. That’s about 30 percent, though, not half. Spokesman Ryan Duffy said projections showed 402,000 Floridians between 100 and 138 percent of the poverty level were expected to enroll over 10 years based on population and economic trends, and that’s the figure to which Weatherford was referring. The speaker said ""today,"" though, not 10 years from now. Our ruling Weatherford said that about half of Florida residents who would qualify for a Medicaid expansion ""can buy a health care plan for $30 a month on the exchange."" Thanks to an unintended quirk of the law, there are somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000 people who can buy cheap coverage on the federal marketplace without the Medicaid expansion. Using premium tax credits, many could find insurance premiums below $30 a month. But that’s not half of the individuals who would have qualified for the Medicaid expansion. It’s actually a much lower number, closer to 25 to 33 percent, depending on the study. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CDD200>],/factchecks/2014/mar/07/will-weatherford/will-weatherford-says-about-half-people-eligible-m/

Barack Obama says half of Republicans agree with his proposed minimum wage hike
","One of President Barack Obama’s signature issues at the moment is a push to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $10.10 per hour. It’s such a popular policy, he said in a speech on March 5, 2014, that even Republicans have little quarrel with it. ""When I talk about (raising the) minimum wage,"" Obama said, ""not only is it good policy, but the majority of the country, including half of Republicans, agree with it."" We wondered whether polling data backed up this claim. So we looked at independent polls taken recently that asked about the minimum wage. A review of the polling data suggests a more nuanced situation than Obama’s claim suggests. Our first look at the data showed that a minimum-wage hike is popular among Americans broadly. For instance, when the CBS News-New York Times poll asked, ""Do you favor or oppose raising the minimum wage to $10.10?"" in February 2014, the poll found 65 percent support. And that was actually down a bit from the 72 percent support registered in the January edition of the poll. Similarly, a Pew Research Center/USA Today poll from January asked whether respondents supported an ""increase in the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour"" and found 73 percent support. But what about Republicans specifically? More than half of Republicans favor a minimum-wage increase, polls found, but in most of these polls, less than half of Republicans supported raising the wage to $10.10, the amount Obama is seeking. One poll that did not specify a target amount for the minimum-wage hike was conducted by Quinnipiac University. It asked, ""Would you support or oppose raising the national minimum wage, which is now $7.25 an hour?"" Among Republicans, 52 percent expressed support, while 45 percent said they opposed it. That provides some support to Obama’s claim. But once respondents were asked by other pollsters about the $10.10 figure -- a roughly 40 percent increase from today’s federal minimum wage -- Republican support sagged. The clearest example is a CBS-New York Times poll from February that asked, ""As you may know, the federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour. Do you favor or oppose raising the minimum wage to $10.10?"" Republicans expressed 42 percent support, 54 percent opposition. Another clear example was an ABC News-Washington Post poll from December, 2013 that asked, ""The minimum wage in this country is now $7.25 an hour. What do you think it should be?"" Among Republicans, only 21 percent favored keeping it the same or lowering it, but even fewer respondents -- 7 percent -- favored a minimum wage in excess of $10. Two other polls showed Republican support close to 50 percent, but falling just short. However, the differences were within the margin of sampling error -- it's possible that more than half of Republicans were in support of a $10.10 wage, though also possible that the actual support level was even lower than the official result. A CBS-New York Times poll from January that asked the same question as the February poll found that Republicans expressed 48 percent support, 51 percent opposition to a $10.10 wage. And an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll from December 2013 asked, ""I'm going to mention a number of different amounts and for each one, please tell me if you strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose raising the hourly minimum wage to that amount."" When presented with the $10.10 rate, 47 percent of Republicans expressed support. One poll clearly supported Obama’s position. The January Pew Research Center/USA Today poll found 53 percent of Republicans backing a $10.10 minimum wage, with 43 percent opposed. The significance of the $10.10 figure is not academic. According to a March 6 account in the Washington Post, ""early last year, White House strategists rejected (the $10.10 figure), worried that it could destroy jobs and anger the business community just as the regulation-heavy Affordable Care Act was about to take effect. Instead, former officials say, the White House settled on a more cautious path, unveiling a $9-an-hour minimum wage proposal — a target even lower than Obama had proposed during the 2008 campaign."" However, the Post reported, the lower amount ""disappointed advocates for the working poor, as well as congressional Democrats, who were already pushing to set the $7.25 wage closer to $10 an hour. Over the past year, Obama reconsidered, casting off initial concerns in favor of unifying his party ahead of this fall’s midterm elections."" In other words, White House officials had long realized there was a difference in the degree of public support for a $10.10 minimum wage and a smaller hike, so it would be misleading for Obama to now imply that majority Republican support for an unspecified minimum-wage hike means that Republicans automatically support the president’s proposal to raise the wage to $10.10. Our ruling Obama said, ""When I talk about (raising the) minimum wage ... half of Republicans agree with it."" Republicans do support a minimum-wage hike if you don't specify a dollar figure. But once you mention the $10.10 target Obama wants, his case gets shakier.

News articles have chronicled a gradual decrease in the rate, including a report that it dipped to a five-year low in November 2013. And yet, with her first TV ad in the 2014 gubernatorial campaign, Democratic candidate Mary Burke contradicts that notion. Midway through the ad, unveiled March 5, 2014, the narrator says that ""under Walker, unemployment’s up."" Simultaneously, a figure on the screen changes from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent. So, under Walker, has unemployment really gone up? And what are the numbers? What Burke says The ad starts by touting Burke. It cites Wisconsin jobs at Trek Bicycle Corp., the Burke family business, where Mary Burke worked as an executive years ago. And it states that Wisconsin had 72,000 more jobs when Burke served as state commerce secretary than it does today. (The 72,000 is an updated version of a claim Burke made in October 2013, which we rated Half True. She was correct on the number -- 84,000 at that time -- but overstated the credit she and Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle deserved.) Then the ad stops talking about Burke and transitions to Walker, citing anti-Burke ads from what it calls ""Walker's"" Republican Governors Association. Walker is a member of the national association's executive committee and was vice chairman in 2013. The narrator then says that ""under Walker, unemployment’s up."" That’s when the figure on the screen spins from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official jobs counter, is footnoted as the source. The narrator continues the attack on Walker by saying job prospects are down and layoffs continue. Regarding the unemployment rate claim specifically, Burke spokesman Joe Zepecki told us: ""We're not examining it in terms of (Walker’s) time in office overall -- we're comparing it what it was when Burke was commerce secretary."" But that's not what the viewer sees and hears when the ad pivots from praising Burke to attacking Walker. It talks only about Walker; it doesn’t compare him to Burke. Moreover, with the narrator’s words presented along with the two percentages on the screen, Burke’s message is that unemployment during Walker’s time as governor has risen from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent. But unemployment was much higher than 4.8 percent when Walker took office. And the trend since then has been down, not up. Rates are down Asked for evidence to back the claim, Zepecki did not cite numbers from the start of Walker’s tenure. He told us that on an annual average, Wisconsin’s unemployment rate was never higher than 4.8 percent during the more 2 1/2 years that Burke was commerce secretary. In contrast, Zepecki said, the monthly rate under Walker has never been below 6.2 percent. We reviewed monthly figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency cited in the ad. -- When Burke served as state commerce secretary -- February 2005 to November 2007 -- Wisconsin's unemployment rate was steady. It started at 4.8 percent, hit a high of 4.9 percent in June 2007 and went as low as 4.6 percent, which was the rate when she left. -- After Burke left the commerce post, unemployment rose, and later dropped, during the rest of Doyle’s second term as governor. The rate peaked three times at 9.2 percent, including as late as January 2010, then eventually fell to 7.8 percent in December 2010, Doyle’s final full month in office. -- Under Walker, the highest unemployment rate has been 7.7 percent -- including in January 2011, the month he took office. Since then, the rate has gradually trended downward, with a bump up here and there, to a low of 6.3 percent in December 2013, the latest month available. (A footnote: The state Department of Workforce Development had reported the December 2013 rate one notch lower, at 6.2 percent. A spokesman for the state agency told us the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics revised the figure to 6.3 percent after the state agency announced its number.) So, without stating any comparison between Burke and Walker, the ad claims unemployment is higher under Walker and provides figures indicating an increase from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent. But the rate was much higher than 4.8 percent when Walker took office and it has gone down, not up, during his tenure. Our rating Burke's said that ""under Walker, unemployment’s up,"" from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent. Burke defends the claim by saying 4.8 percent is a reference to when she served as state commerce secretary, which was several years before Walker became governor. But the ad gives no indication that that is the comparison she is making. Moreover, during Walker’s time as governor, unemployment started at 7.7 percent, not 4.8 percent. And rather than trending upward, the rate has steadily dropped to 6.3 percent. For a claim that is false and ridiculous, we give Burke a Pants on Fire.

Austin's population has doubled every 25 years or so since its founding
","Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell, set to relinquish his office after this year, warned in his last ""State of the City"" address that growth continues to pinch. Setting up his pitch for voter approval of an inner-city rail line, Leffingwell said Austin is ""a city that has basically doubled in size every 25 years or so since it was founded."" Take that, all ye who bemoan how much the city has grown (oh-so crowding the roads) just since you arrived. To our inquiry, mayoral spokesman Reyne Telles told us by email that Leffingwell was referring to population growth, not geographic expansion. Telles added that Leffingwell based his declaration on a chart posted on the city’s web page devoted to local and regional demographics as overseen by Ryan Robinson, the city demographer. The chart shows the city’s population in many of the years from 1840 through 2013. That would cover Austin’s lifetime. An Austin History Center web page says the city, originally Waterloo, was purchased to be the capital of the Republic of Texas in March 1839 and renamed in honor of Stephen F. Austin. The city was incorporated on Dec. 27, 1839. In Austin’s early years, the chart indicates, the population doubled even more frequently than Leffingwell said. Specifically, the population surged six-fold from 1840 to 1860, going from 553 to 3,493, according to the chart, while over the next 20 years, the number of residents increased three-fold, to 11,013. The population doubled in the next 20 years, reaching 22,258 in 1900, the chart shows, before nearly doubling over the next 25 years, reaching 42,174 in 1925, up 90 percent from 1900. It took 15 years for the population to double afresh; it reached 87,930 in 1940, according to the chart. Twenty years later, the chart shows, Austin’s population of 186,545 was more than double its 1940 population. It took 23 years for another doubling, according to the chart, with the 1983 population reaching 373,541. Some 25 years later, in 2008, the city’s population of 750,525 was double its 1983 population, the chart shows. To get the most up-to-date sense of growth from the chart, we also looked at whether the mayor’s claim holds up if we look back in time starting in 2013 when Austin had 842,750 residents. That 2013 tally was almost double the city’s population 25 years earlier. Gauged another way, the 2013 population was more than double Austin’s population of 417,033 in 1985. So, that doubling took 28 years. Telles of the mayor’s office also pointed us to a city report featuring a graphic (below) showing Austin’s population growth since 1900. ""Austin’s growth has been very close to doubling every 20 years,"" the report says. 
 Our ruling Leffingwell said Austin is a ""city that has basically doubled in size every 25 years or so since it was founded.""

Hutchison says revised business tax created state's largest tax increase
","The revamped business tax was a point of contention between Gov. Rick Perry and Republican opponent Kay Bailey Hutchison, a U.S. senator from Texas, during the first GOP gubernatorial debate. Portraying Perry as an enemy of business, Hutchison lashed out at him for signing legislation in 2006 that restructured the state’s franchise tax as part of a tax swap intended to reduce school property taxes.“The largest tax increase that we have ever had in our state is yours – it is the business margins tax that you signed, governor,” Hutchison said.Perry rebutted later in the debate that he has in fact cut the business tax — a claim we'll address at a later date. (When it comes to tax matters, it's dangerous for truth-testers as well as politicians to bite off more than they can chew.)For now, we'll gnaw on Hutchison's claim: Did the revised franchise tax, often called the margins tax, amount to the biggest tax increase in Texas history? For most qualifying businesses, the franchise tax is 1 percent of their total annual revenue minus one of three options: the cost of goods sold, employee compensation or 30 percent of total revenue.In support for its claim that the revised tax was indeed historic, the Hutchison camp offered a background paper citing several news articles and government documents.Among the citations was an item from the Dallas Morning News Trail Blazers campaign blog, also mentioned by Hutchison in the debate, stating that the ""largest tax increase in Texas"" occurred under Perry's leadership. But the newspaper made an important distinction that Hutchison omitted in the debate: The article included both a tobacco tax and the franchise tax as the sources of that increase. In the information that it provided after the debate, the Hutchison campaign said that ""Perry's new margin tax cost taxpayers $8.8 billion"" over the 2008-09 biennium and compared that figure with the estimated $5.7 billion tax package signed into law in 1987 by Gov. Bill Clements. At the time, the 1987 legislation was widely reported to be the largest tax hike in the state’s history.But it turns out there are fatal flaws in the Hutchison campaign's math.For instance, the $8.8 billion figure is the total amount generated by the franchise tax, not the net increase resulting from the revision that became law under Perry. So it's misleading for the campaign to cite that number when discussing tax increases. The actual increase — revenue above what the old franchise tax would have brought in — was about $3 billion, significantly less than what had been projected. Let's compare that with the largest single piece of the Clements-era tax package: a hike in the sales tax. After it was enacted, sales tax revenues went up $4.2 billion during 1988-89 compared with the previous biennium.If you're keeping track, that's significantly more than the $3 billion wrought by changes in the franchise tax. However, the Texas state comptroller's office says that it cannot say with certainty how much of that 1988-89 sales tax revenue increase can be attributed to the legislation per se and how much is due to other factors, such as increased consumer spending.As we evaluated Hutchison's claim, we also learned that the broadening of the franchise tax did not necessarily mean that businesses paid more taxes overall after the 2006 changes. Some companies actually wound up paying less, thanks to the reduction in school property taxes that was part of the deal.According to experts, there are several ways to try to determine which was the state's largest tax increase in history. We used the simplest, looking at total dollars brought in. Another way would be to calculate the percentage increase of franchise tax revenue and compare that to percentage increases in other state taxes.Taking the percentage approach, we found that the 51 percent increase in franchise tax revenue for 2008-09, compared with the previous biennium, was not the largest for that tax. After the Legislature revamped the franchise tax in 1991, revenue grew 92 percent over the next two years.Hutchison's campaign took the dollar approach to the franchise tax instead of percentages. But on either basis, her claim is flawed.First, the franchise tax that Perry signed did not result in an $8.8 billion increase in tax revenue. Second, it appears that previous revisions of the sales tax have resulted in larger revenue increases. Third, examined on a percentage basis, the new franchise tax didn't set a revenue record.Hutchison bit off more than she could chew with her campaign rhetoric. Her claim that the expansion of the business franchise tax represents the largest increase in state history is False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B89280>],/factchecks/2010/jan/22/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-revised-business-tax-created-states/

Chain e-mail claims health care bills in Congress would provide free health care to illegal immigrants
","It's hard to say when a chain e-mail has reached critical mass. Although we'd seen one from former attorney Michael Connelly floating around for months, we never weighed in on it. The chief claim in the e-mail is that the Democrats' health care plan is unconstitutional, which is a matter of opinion, not fact. Also, we'd dealt with many of the other issues raised in the e-mail. And it's an e-mail that was penned in August.The thing is, we are still getting lots of readers sending it to us, asking us to fact-check it. It's clearly still in high circulation. We've decided that critical mass has been reached.And so we're revisiting several claims in the e-mail. In this item, we will address the claim that HR 3200, ""The Affordable Health Care Choices Act of 2009,"" would provide ""free health care for illegal immigrants.""It's hardly a new charge. You may recall U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., famously yelling ""You lie!"" during a joint session of Congress when President Barack Obama said the reforms Democrats were proposing would not apply to those who are in the United States illegally.In an item we wrote then, we noted that, in fact, the House bill specifically stated that ""undocumented aliens"" would not be eligible for credits to help them buy health insurance, in Section 246 on Page 143. Still, Wilson and Connelly and others argued the bill did not spell out verification procedures strong enough to ensure that illegal immigrants couldn't access the health care plan.""There are no provisions for enforcing it,"" Connelly told us in an interview on Jan. 20, 2010. ""The loophole is too big.""Others have made the same criticism. The anti-immigration group Federation for American Immigration Reform argued that illegal immigrants would be permitted to purchase insurance on the national health insurance exchange because the bill does not include a mechanism for verifying citizenship. So, the logic goes, illegal immigrants would have the chance to purchase insurance in the public option, a government-run health care plan that would offer basic coverage at a low price.FAIR also argued for more robust verification measures for the affordability credit and making sure that illegal immigrant parents won't be able to receive coverage if their citizen children are eligible. FAIR had a point that illegal immigrants would likely be able to buy insurance on the national health insurance exchange. We didn't see anything in the bills that would hinder that. A Congressional Research Service report issued Aug. 25, 2009, confirmed our observation. The House bill ""does not contain any restrictions on noncitizens participating in the Exchange — whether the noncitizens are legally or illegally present, or in the United States temporarily or permanently,"" the report said. But buying insurance on an exchange is different from getting free health care, as Connelly's e-mail suggested. We're not aware of any particular restrictions that stop illegal immigrants from buying private insurance now. We should note that while Connelly's e-mail references HR 3200, the House version of the bill in play when Connelly wrote his e-mail in August, it's not the bill that the House ultimately passed. According to Connelly, the version ultimately passed by the House (3962) is even worse because it has lower standards than the version in the summer. The version that passed only requires that people be residents of the United States in order to be eligible for the health care exchange. One could simply provide an electric bill to clear that hurdle, he said.We checked the bill and found that Connelly is right about the language that says people have to be residents of the United States to be eligible.But we also found language similar to the older bill. Section 34, titled ""No federal payment for undocumented aliens,"" states unequivocally, ""Nothing in this subtitle shall allow Federal payments for affordability credits on behalf of individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States."" And Sec. 1786 prohibits Medicaid and CHIP payments to ""individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States.""We further note that if the tax credits are administered through the Internal Revenue Service, there would be built-in scrutiny. For instance, if a system were set up for taxpayers to declare insurance expenses and then receive a refund or a rebate, illegal immigrants couldn't obtain coverage, ""because illegal immigrants do not have legitimate Social Security numbers,"" Marc Rosenblum, a senior policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, a group that is generally pro-immigration, told PolitiFact back in September when this issue was hot. ""Screening out illegal immigrants through the tax system would prevent them from obtaining health care-related subsidies."" In addition, language in the House bill provides clear authority for the new government official who would run the exchange to set up that verification, as the Congressional Research Service report notes. Rosenblum concurs. ""The commissioner could enforce these restrictions in one of two ways: through document- and database-based screening requirements as in the Medicaid system, or by reimbursing health care expenses through tax refunds,"" Rosenblum said. It's one thing to argue that the bill lacks adequate verification procedures (which is certainly debatable). It's another to claim if the those procedures aren't stringent enough, that the bill would provide free health care to illegal immigrants. Especially when the bill specifically states there can be no federal payments to undocumented aliens. That was in 3200 when Connelly wrote his e-mail, and it's in the bill the House ultimately passed. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096783900>],/factchecks/2010/jan/21/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-health-care-bills-congress-wou/

Chain e-mail claims House health care bill would provide free abortion
","A chain e-mail written by former attorney Michael Connelly -- which blasts the Democrats' health care plan as unconstitutional -- was penned in August, but continues to make the rounds. Although many of the issues in the e-mail have been addressed in previous PolitiFact items, we continue to get queries about it.So we've decided to visit -- or revisit -- several claims made in the e-mail. In this item, we will address the claim that HR 3200, ""The Affordable Health Care Choices Act of 2009,"" would provide for ""free abortion services, and probably forced participation in abortions by members of the medical profession."" In the health care debate, abortion coverage has been a moving target as provisions have changed in various versions of the House and Senate bills. And we should note that Connelly wrote his e-mail back in August, long before the bills came to the floors of the two chambers.The House ultimately passed a health care bill that included an abortion amendment that essentially renders Connelly's argument moot. Still, Connelly said in an interview with PolitiFact on Jan. 20, 2010, that the same concerns he raised about the House bill back in August apply to the version of the health care bill passed by the Senate.Before we address that, let's back up a step. Although the original health care reform bills introduced in both the House and Senate were silent on abortion, the issue came to a head in late July when the House Energy and Commerce Committee passed an amendment offered by Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., which sought to make abortion coverage available in both the public plan and in private plans participating in the exchange, but paid exclusively through patient premiums, not government subsidies. Under that amendment, insurers would not be required to offer, or be prohibited from offering, abortion services in order to participate in the exchange. It also provided ""conscience protections"" so that any insurance plan participating in the exchange could not discriminate against hospitals or other health care facilities (such as Catholic hospitals) unwilling to provide abortions. That was largely the working House plan when Connelly penned his e-mail. And by that measure, we think Connelly was wrong when he said the bill would provide free abortions. Insurance purchased through private insurers on the exchange or the public option would not be ""free."" In fact, the amendment required that abortion coverage be paid through premiums paid by the insured. And Connelly's claim that the bill would probably mean ""forced participation in abortions by members of the medical profession,"" was specifically prohibited in ""conscience protection"" measures in the amendment.And that all became moot in November 2009, when a group of Democrats led by Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan forced a vote on an amendment that included tight restrictions barring any insurance plan that is purchased with government subsidies from covering abortions. It passed.Connelly said the concerns he raised in his August e-mail no longer apply to the House bill. But they still apply to the bill that passed the Senate, he said. The abortion language in the Senate bill is close to that in the Capps Amendment (though the Senate plan does not include a public option). As with the earlier House bill, the Senate plan would allow insurance companies on the exchange to offer abortion services. But for the same reasons we mentioned about the earlier House plan, we think it's a distortion to say it would provide ""free abortions."" And as in the earlier House bill, there are specific ""conscience protections"" written into the bill that make it clear doctors could not be discriminated against for opting not to provide abortions. So under the bill, no doctors would be forced to provide abortions.In other words, the claim was false when Connelly made it; it's moot now with regard to the House bill; and it's false with regard to the Senate bill.In other words, under no version of the plan then or now is Connelly's statement accurate. And we rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096782B00>],/factchecks/2010/jan/21/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-house-health-care-bill-would-p/

Limbaugh claims White House benefits from Haiti donations
","After an earthquake hit Haiti last week, Rush Limbaugh made a series of controversial claims about the disaster, which killed tens of thousands and devastated the infrastructure and institutions of the poor Caribbean nation. On the Jan. 13, 2010, edition of his show, Limbaugh said President Barack Obama's administration would use the quake to ""build 'credibility' with the black community -- in the both light-skinned and dark-skinned black community in this country."" He claimed Americans have ""already donated to Haiti. It's called the U.S. income tax."" While talking with a caller, he cast doubt on whether money donated through Whitehouse.gov would end up in Haiiti, and said the people who did donate through the White House would find their e-mail addresses receiving fundraising appeals from Obama.

On Monday, he suggested that the White House was somehow acting as a middleman for donations and then skimming off a high percentage for administrative costs. Limbaugh noted the criticisms of the charity run by Wyclef Jean (""Is Wyclef Jean a rap star or is he just reggae kind of music?"" Limbaugh asked) has high administrative costs. ""What about the administrative costs of donating through WhiteHouse.gov, for crying out loud?"" Limbaugh asked. ""Do you know that one of the reasons the welfare budget is as high as it is -- and these numbers are I guess 10 years old, but in 1999, maybe earlier than that, for every dollar that was budgeted for welfare or food stamps, AFDC, whatever it is, 28 cents of it was spent on administering it, so 72 cents out of every dollar got there. I mean the high administrative costs are actually when you donate through the government,"" he said. ""I don't know of a president ever who has asked people to donate to a relief effort through a White House Web site. It's never happened before. ... Nobody here ever said don't donate. We just pointed out you already contribute to the government with your income taxes. If you want to donate above and beyond that, go through a charity that's constantly on the ground in Haiti, or the Red Cross, if you want to go that route or whatever. Nobody said do not donate, which is what is being reported.""

In one respect, Limbaugh is right: He never said Americans shouldn't donate to Haiti. He did say to do it through private groups. But his point here was that the White House was somehow acting as an inefficient middleman.

That got us wondering: Would donating through WhiteHouse.gov be inefficient compared with donating directly to the Red Cross or some other charitable organization? Do ""high administrative costs"" happen ""when you donate through the government""? Instead of helping the people displaced by the quake, would the money instead be used to pay government salaries?

We started looking around and discovered this: You never could actually donate through WhiteHouse.gov. On seemingly every White House Web page that mentions Haiti, there is a link to the Red Cross or the Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund. (There are no links to Wyclef Jean's group.) But those are just links to those sites -- not some kind of PayPal for the Obama White House.

""I can confirm that we are not processing/have never processed any donations to Haiti through whitehouse.gov, but are just directing folks to other groups,"" White House spokesman Matt Lehrich wrote in an e-mail. Lehrich also said there was no overhead being delivered to the White House nor the federal government, and that e-mail addresses of donors to the Red Cross or the Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund wouldn't be shared.

So it makes no difference whether you click the link from WhiteHouse.gov or go directly to the groups' own sites.

To address Limbaugh's point that some charities make more efficient use of donations than others, we checked to see how the ones recommended on the White House site stack up.

We looked at Charity Navigator, a Web site that grades and ranks charities. It gives the Red Cross a rating of three stars out of four. The Clinton-Bush Haiti fund, a joint effort of Bush's Communities Foundation of Texas and Clinton's William J. Clinton Foundation, was only formed last weekend and doesn't have a rating yet. But the William J. Clinton Foundation has a full four-star rating, and the Communities Foundation earned three stars.

We looked at another charity ranking system, the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance. The American Red Cross made its list of recommended Haiti charities. But the Clinton Foundation only fulfilled 13 of the 20 standards for charity accountability. The Communities Foundation hasn't been rated yet.

In comparison, Wyclef Jean's Yele Foundation, which sparked Limbaugh's complaint, isn't rated by Charity Navigator. But in a blog post, the organization seems skeptical of Yele. The Wise Giving Alliance doesn't have a rating for Yele, but its director told the Associated Press the organization was ""questionable."" (Jean has defended the organization.)

So Limbaugh is seriously distorting the truth, suggesting that people can donate through the White House when in fact the White House site has simply posted links to groups that earn generally positive ratings. There's no evidence the White House is using any of these donations for administrative costs, and the charities aren't sharing donors' e-mail addresses with the White House. Limbaugh is making a ridiculously false claim that the Obama administration is capitalizing on a tragedy. That's enough to set the meter ablaze.

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Elections', 'Pundits', ""Kelly O'Donnell""]","
Scott Brown mostly avoided mentioning that he's a Republican
","The closely watched race to fill the U.S. Senate seat of the late Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., ended with victory by a long-shot Republican.

In the runup to Scott Brown's special election victory on Jan. 19, 2010, pundits floated a variety of possible explanations for his surprise surge in the historically Democratic state, from dissatisfaction with President Barack Obama's domestic agenda to a poorly run campaign by Brown's Democratic opponent, state attorney general Martha Coakley. Another explanation was that Brown went to great lengths to avoid identifying himself as a Republican.

One place this claim surfaced was in a Today show piece by NBC correspondent Kelly O'Donnell. The segment -- which aired Jan. 19, 2010, the day of the election -- included an interview with Brown himself.

In it, O'Donnell asked Brown, ""You don't mention the Republican Party much in your campaign. Why is that?""

Brown responded, ""I think people know I'm a Republican. That's never been a secret.""

O'Donnell, in a voice-over, continued, ""Not a secret, but clearly not on display. No mention of being a Republican on Brown's bus, signs or campaign ads.""

That's not unusual in some congressional races, but a caller on C-SPAN asked us to check if it were true in this case. Did Brown go through the campaign without mentioning his party affiliation? First, we looked at the specific contexts that O'Donnell had mentioned. In addition to the footage in her piece, we found a blog post that featured various photos of a Brown bus tour through the Bay State, and the images clearly show that the exterior of his bus reads, ""Bold, New Leadership: Scott Brown, United States Senate,"" along with a number for accessing the campaign by text message and a reminder to vote on Jan. 19. So no mention of Brown's party on his bus.

Ditto for his campaign signs. In all the pictures we saw, Brown's signs were devoid of any mention of the Republican Party.

Finally, we looked at the broadcast and Web advertisements posted on Brown's campaign Web site. We found that the candidate consistently avoided any mention of what party banner he was running under.

Then we broadened the search to take in the whole Brown campaign Web site.

We found nothing referring to his party on the home page, on his biography page, or in any of his Web videos. In fact, most of the scattered mentions of the word ""Republican"" on his site were extremely minor -- and nearly impossible to locate without a Google search.

For instance, he posted an endorsement by Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele as well as a couple of other endorsements, including some by Massachusetts Republican officials. In the news section, he linked to a number of newspaper articles identifying himself as a Republican, and on his calendar, he listed events with the Republican Jewish Coalition and a ""Republican rally.""

""He and his team clearly sought to emphasize the word 'independent' over 'Republican,'"" said Scott Helman, political editor at the Boston Globe.

Rare was the document posted on Brown's Web site that clearly identified the candidate as a Republican.

In his victory speech after the Dec. 8, 2009, primary, Brown introduced himself to the state's electorate by saying, ""For my fellow citizens watching at home, my name is Scott Brown. I'm the Republican in the race. You may not have heard of me before now because all the focus has been on the other side where the candidates were competing for title of ‘most liberal.’ ""

But even in that speech, Brown made a point of undercutting his partisan label, saying that he was speaking ""in the name of every independent-thinking citizen, whether they be Democrat, unenrolled-independent or Republican.""

Political analysts said that over the past decade, it has become common for Republican candidates in increasingly Democratic New England to avoid mentioning their party affiliation in official communications.

""One of the ways you can see this most clearly is in the lawn sign wars,"" said Roy Occhiogrosso, a Democratic consultant in neighboring Connecticut. ""Democrats frequently have the word 'Democrat' on their lawn sign, while Republicans, unless they are running in a solid Republican legislative district, almost never have the word 'Republican' on their signs.""

But before we conclude that Brown dwelled in a universe beyond partisanship, it's worth noting that his message managed to communicate clear opposition to the Democratic majority in Washington and Boston even as he declined to tout the Republican Party by name.

The balance between being explicit and implicit began with his Sept. 12, 2009, speech announcing his candidacy. In that address, Brown said, ""We have 11 other elected officials from the majority party in Washington, and the governor has a Washington office to assist Massachusetts there as well. All of these officials usually vote the same way and take their orders from the same special-interest groups and political leaders. Does Massachusetts need another elected official to merely rubber stamp the policies of one party or administration?""

""People know Scott Brown's a Republican,"" said Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to the Brown campaign. ""If they don't know, then they're not paying attention.""

Later, as his campaign gained steam, Brown reveled in the possibility that he could become the 41st Republican senator -- enough to keep the Democrats from passing health care reform or other parts of the president's agenda. He even took to signing autographs ""Scott Brown 41.""

In a Jan. 13, 2010, news release attacking Coakley's ""negative and untrue attacks"" on health care, Brown took the rare step of referring to himself explicitly as a Republican. ""Time and again, Martha has said she would be the 60th vote for a health care bill that will slash Medicare by a half-trillion dollars, raise taxes and increase spending. As the 41st Republican senator, I would insist we start over on health care and craft a bipartisan bill that will lead to meaningful reform.""

Tufts University political scientist Jeffrey Berry calls the notion of Brown being the 41st vote ""the most powerful thing he said on the campaign trail. Everyone in Massachusetts understood that meant he would vote like a national Republican once he joined the Senate. He nationalized the election and that brought him money, volunteers, attention, and, ultimately, votes.""

So, back to O'Donnell's claim that Brown's Republican affiliation was ""not a secret, but clearly not on display.""

O'Donnell was correct that during the campaign there was ""no mention of being a Republican on Brown's bus, signs or campaign ads."" We did find two brief instances -- one in a speech, one in a news release -- in which Brown referred to himself as a Republican. But while news coverage regularly mentioned his party affiliation, meaning that it should have been no secret to voters, the candidate clearly downplayed his partisan ties. So we find O'Donnell's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0C5DC0>],/factchecks/2010/jan/20/kelly-odonnell/scott-brown-mostly-avoided-mentioning-hes-republic/

Obama claims Washington Times praised his budget-cutting
","Under fire from Republicans for his sweeping plans to reform health care and the $787 billion economic stimulus bill, President Barack Obama is trying to portray himself as a budget-cutter. So in a recent speech, he said the Washington Times, a newspaper famous for its conservative editorial page, had given him a shoutout.During a speech at a retreat of the House Democratic Caucus on Jan. 14, 2010, Obama said, ""The Washington Times -- not known for (being) a big promoter of the Obama agenda -- pointed out that we had succeeded where previous administrations had failed because of the work that was done here in this Congress to finally get serious on some of these spending cuts that had been talked about for years.""That surprised us, so we looked into it.Indeed, we found that on the same day the president delivered the speech, the Washington Times had published a story with the headline ""Obama wins more spending cuts than Bush."" Anyone who heard Obama's speech or read the transcript very well could have thought he was referring to praise from the Times' conservative editorial page. In the parlance of the nation's capital, references like this are usually referring to editorials, not news stories. But in this case, it was a news story. It began:""President Obama notched substantial successes in spending cuts last year, winning 60 percent of his proposed cuts and managing to get Congress to ax several programs that had bedeviled President George W. Bush for years.""The story offered a remarkably positive account of Obama's budget cutting, saying that he ""was victorious in getting Congress to slash 24 programs and achieved some level of success in reducing nine other programs.""It called the cuts a ""bright spot in an otherwise dreary budget picture"" and said Obama's ""success rate at cutting programs was significantly higher than President Bush. But the article noted that the cuts would barely put a dent in the overall federal deficit, pointing out that they accounted for ""well less than one-half of 1 percent of the total federal budget.""So Obama was right that the Washington Times had run such an article. But his comment suggested it was editorial praise when it wasn't. So we'll take Obama down one notch for not noting it was a news story and rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096832FC0>],/factchecks/2010/jan/20/barack-obama/Obama-Washington-Times-budget-cutting/

Sen. John Cornyn says Americans rate getting back to work as national priority
","U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, heartily welcomed Republican Scott Brown’s upset win Tuesday of a Senate seat in Massachusetts — a victory that’ll soon give the GOP the 41 Senate seats needed to filibuster legislation to foil the Democratic majority.  Cornyn, who doubles as chairman of a political committee devoted to electing GOP senators, was asked by the Fox News Channel on Wednesday what Republicans should do with the message sent by Massachusetts voters.  Cornyn initially mentioned public concern about Democrats’ closed-door rewrites of a health care overhaul. But, Cornyn continued, this ""is a matter also of misplaced priorities and the No. 1 issue that the American people care about is getting America back to work.""  We wondered if Cornyn correctly pegged Americans' priority issue.  Indeed, a recent national poll places the economy at the top of voter concerns. In the poll taken Jan. 12-15 for The Washington Post and ABC News, 42 percent of respondents identified the economy as the most important problem they’d like to see President Obama and Congress address this year.  Among those economy-focused respondents, 26 percent singled out jobs/employment as a priority.  The second-highest-rated issue was health care, named as the first concern of 24 percent.  Similarly, a poll taken Jan. 10-14 by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News found jobs topping Americans’ concerns. Thirty-eight percent of respondents said job creation and economic growth was the top priority. Thirteen percent chose national security/terrorism and 13 percent said the deficit and government spending.  So the senator got it right. Americans consider jobs the No. 1 issue right now.

"['Health Care', 'Texas', 'Kay Bailey Hutchison']","
Hutchison says the health care bill will raise costs, taxes and lower the quality of care
","
A day after Senate Democrats released their version of the health care reform bill on Nov. 18, U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who's seeking the GOP nod for governor, debuted a TV ad attacking the legislation.

""Everything about it is going to raise costs, raise taxes and lower the quality of health care,"" Hutchison says in the ad.

Everything? This kind of sweeping claim is often hard to back up with evidence. Hutchinson said everything in the bills would raise costs, raise taxes and lower quality. So if we can find anything that lowers costs, lowers taxes or raises quality, that would undermine the accuracy of her claim.

Hutchison's campaign told us the senator was criticizing all Democratic proposals. Her campaign sent us about 20 excerpts from documents seemingly supporting her claim, attributing most of it to to the Republican Policy Committee and the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, both in Washington.

We don't dispute any of the projected costs and taxes her campaign sent us. But like many parties to the health care debate, Hutchison appears to have cherry-picked numbers to prop up the points she wants to make.

Let's talk about tax increases first.

Hutchison notes that the bill includes a ""$149 billion tax increase on private health insurance plans."" She fails to mention that the levy, known as the ""Cadillac tax,"" is one measure the federal government expects to generate revenue by taxing high-priced insurance plans (not all private policies).

That is, most people, about 75 percent, won't see an additional tax.

Hutchison cites ""$43 billion in new taxes and fines levied on individuals and businesses,"" an abbreviated interpretation of how much the CBO has projected the federal government will generate in penalty payments from people and businesses who choose not to enroll in an insurance plan. She doesn't note that those increases are among the measure's features intended to offset costs.

And she also fails to note that a good chunk of taxpayers — those who make up to 400 percent of the poverty level — will get a tax credit from the government to buy health insurance. So those people won't get a tax increase and in fact get a material benefit from the plan.

Next, we looked at projected costs.

Hutchison's campaign pointed us to total projected federal health care expenditures: $234 billion, according to a report by Richard Foster, chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that administers Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.

Unnoted by Hutchison's camp: The $234 billion reflects how much national health care expenditures would increase by 2016 — including the cost of providing coverage for 33 million people who were previously uninsured — about 10 percent of the population, most of whom (we'll suppose) would see the new benefit as a boon.

Also unnoted by Hutchison: The CBO projects that under the Senate's health care plan, most insured people would see their premiums drop slightly by 2016.

The CBO also concluded that through 2019, the Senate approach would reduce the federal deficit by $130 billion and slow the rate of federal spending growth due to new taxes and provisions to reduce spending over time.

Spending cuts have also been proposed to save money — Hutchison notes $120 billion from Medicare Advantage, among others. We learned that's what she's referring to when she says quality will suffer.

Yet the Senate plan separately has features intended to enhance quality such as pilot programs rewarding doctors for improving patients' outcomes and aimed at curbing unnecessary medical tests. 
We looked too at the impact of the plan on American taxpayers. The bottom line, according to the CMS and CBO projections, is that most people's taxes would not increase and most people's premiums wouldn't either.

Summing up, Hutchison is correct that the Senate plan is projected to increase costs — at the onset — and to add taxes. But she she overlooked CBO projections stating the plan would slow long-term federal spending thanks to its provisions designed to offset costs. 
Hutchison stretches too far by saying everything in the bill would raise taxes, drive up costs and conceivably diminish quality. As we've described, several parts of the bill are intended to lower costs, and most people won't see a tax increase. 
We rate her overreach False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097746740>],/factchecks/2010/jan/20/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-health-care-bill-will-raise-costs-t/

Linda Chavez-Thompson says ""most Texans aren't millionaires""
","Linda Chavez-Thompson kicked off her campaign for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor by assailing the personal wealth of incumbent Republican David Dewhurst, who’s jet-fueled three winning statewide campaigns partly from personal funds.Chavez-Thompson, whose background lies in labor unions, said Jan. 4: “I know I will be an underdog against Lt. Gov. Dewhurst, who is a comfortable millionaire. But most Texans are not millionaires.” See her single out the Lone Star state's wealth stereotype at the 1:08 mark of the video at right, which was posted on YouTube by the Texas Tribune.Thanks go to Chavez-Thompson for stating the obvious. We here at PolitiFact aren't millionaires and expect most Texans aren't, either.Still, Chavez-Thompson caused us to wonder: How many Texans are millionaires? And are many Texans well off compared to people elsewhere?We found that the latest statistics on Texas millionaires date back a few years. In 2004, according to an Internal Revenue Service estimate posted online in 2008, Texas was home to 108,000 individuals whose net worth was $1.5 million or more. (Why the $1.5 million benchmark? We don't know, but we suspect that a meager $1 million doesn't go as far as it used to.)Karl Eschbach, the state demographer, peeked at the same analysis and offered a quick caveat: The estimate was reached before the nation entered a recession partly driven by plunging home values, fueling drops in net worth.In 2004, 1 in 208 Texans were in the $1.5-million wealth tier--about 1/2 of 1 percent of the state's nearly 22.5 million residents. Texas ranked 37th nationally in its share of individuals with net worth of $1.5 million or more. Connecticut ranked first, Florida second, the District of Columbia third.Eschbach noted that the wealthiest people in Texas were better off than their rich counterparts in most states. In 2004, Texas ranked 18th in the average net worth of individuals whose net worth was $1.5 million or more. The average net wealth of such Texans was more than $4.5 million.We also found a 2001 estimate, based on an IRS sampling of federal tax returns, suggesting Texas was home to 182,000 millionaires, amounting to less than 1 percent of its 21.3 million residents that year.California was the heady home to 572,000 millionaires, New York to 317,000 and Florida to 249,000Even Illinois had more millionaires, at 185,000, making us scratch our heads: When was the last time peacock-proud Texans had to fret about keeping up with residents of the Land of Lincoln?In her campaign kickoff speech, Chavez-Thompson didn’t recap the less salutary fact that Texas families rated as poorer than families nationally. In 2007, according to the Census Bureau, half of American households had income exceeding $50,740 and half made less than that. Texas had a median household income of $47,548. Of course, Texas still had enclaves of wealth. According to the bureau’s study, the Dallas suburb of Plano was a nationally prominent pocket of lucre, with a median household income of $84,492.At the other end of the scale, the state retained bastions of poverty along the Mexico border. Residents of El Paso County had median household incomes of $34,980 while residents of Hidalgo and Cameron counties had median incomes of $30,295 and $29,347, respectively, both ranking worse off than other U.S. counties. As of 2008, nearly 16 percent of Texans (3.8 million residents) lived in poverty, with 22.5 percent of children living in poverty, according to the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for government aid to low-income residents. Nationally, 13.2 percent of residents lived in poverty, including 18.2 percent of children. Eschbach said sizing up the state's wealth is no cinch.""You have a lot of major corporations headquartered here. You've got a lot of wealth creation,"" Eschbach said. ""In that respect, we certainly aren't the wealthiest state or the poorest state. We do have a large representation of very disadvantaged people. At the same time, we have a robust economy.""Much debate lies in the details. Yet to Eschbach and the rest of Texas, Chavez-Thompson's statement was no surprise.We rate her statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097746B80>],/factchecks/2010/jan/20/linda-chavez-thompson/says-most-texans-arent-millionaires/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Foreign Policy', 'Pundits', 'Glenn Beck']","
Beck says Chile easily tops U.S. in ""economic freedom"" rankings
","Chile, an eager adapter of free-market principles in Latin America, has long been a favorite of economic conservatives. Recently, a decision by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- the club of rich nations -- to invite Chile to become a member has become, for many on the right, symbolic of how adhering to free-market principles can vault former Third World countries into economic affluence.

In a video blog post dated Jan. 15, 2010, conservative TV and radio host Glenn Beck championed Chile as a nation no longer ""struggling with poverty,"" having overcome a reputation for corruption and bureaucracy through such policies as freer labor markets and lower taxes.

In addition to citing the OECD invitation, Beck pointed to its high standing in recent international ratings of ""economic freedom.""

""They ranked 71st of 72 in 1975 in a study of economic freedom in the world,"" Beck said in his video blog post. ""Now, in that same study, they rank third. The U.S. is ranked 17th.""

We wondered whether Chile is really that far ahead of the U.S. in ""economic freedom,"" so we looked at the data.

We located an editorial in Investor's Business Daily -- a leading voice for free-market capitalism -- that appears to be the source of Beck's statistic.

The editorial, published Dec. 4, 2009, was later picked up by a smattering of conservative bloggers on its way to Beck's desk. The editorial said in part, ""In the Cato Institute's 1975 Economic Freedom of the World Report, [Chile] ranked a wretched 71 out of 72 countries evaluated. Today it's a different country altogether. Embracing markets has made it one of the most open economies in the world, ranking third on Cato's index, just behind Hong Kong and Singapore."" Later on, the editorial added that the United States ""ranks just 17th on Cato's 2009 Index of Economic Freedom.""

However, if you look at the 2009 Economic Freedom of the World study by Cato -- a libertarian think tank in Washington -- the numbers were actually different. Hong Kong and Singapore did indeed rank 1 and 2, respectively, but then came New Zealand and Switzerland before Chile at No. 5. In the No. 6 spot, behind by a fraction of a point, was the United States. So while it's true that, by Cato's reckoning, Chile ranked ahead of the United States, it was less of a blowout than Beck or IBD indicated.

We also looked at the two prior years' Cato studies to make sure that Beck wasn't simply off by a year. That wasn't the case. In the 2008 study, Chile ranked No. 6 with the United States at 8, in a two-way tie with Australia and once again behind by a fraction of a point. And in the 2007 study, the United States actually ranked higher than Chile. The United States was tied for fifth while Chile was tied for 11th.

One of the co-authors of Cato's 2009 study -- Joshua Hall, a Beloit College economist -- also confirmed to PolitiFact that the United States has never ranked as low as 17th in all the years that study has been conducted. Another co-author, James Gwartney, a Florida State University economist, confirmed that Beck was correct in saying that Chile ranked 71st out of 72 countries in 1975.

In the meantime, we also looked at whether Beck (or IBD) had mistaken the Cato study for a different report. As it happens, there are at least three other studies that attempt to rank the nations of the world based on ""economic freedom"" or a similar yardstick.

The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, publishes an annual Index of Economic Freedom. In 2009, the United States ranked sixth in its study while Chile ranked 11th.

The World Economic Forum, a Geneva-based international organization, publishes an annual Global Competitiveness Index. Its 2009-10 ratings peg the United States at No. 2 and Chile at 30.

Finally, the World Bank publishes an annual ""Doing Business"" ranking that seeks to measure which countries have a regulatory environment ""conducive to the operation of business."" In this tally, the United States finished fourth overall with Chile 49th.

Given these ratings, it would seem unlikley that Beck or IBD could have accidentally been referring to any of these studies.

However, we would be remiss if we failed to add that, despite the apparent flub on reporting the rankings, Beck's overall assessment of Chile's recent economic history is largely accurate.

We spoke with three experts on Latin American economics and politics who work with centrist-to-liberal think tanks -- Julia Sweig of the Council on Foreign Relations, Andres Martinez of the New America Foundation and Leonardo Martinez-Diaz of the Brookings Institution -- and they agreed that there is a broad ideological consensus on Beck's two key points: Namely, Chile has improved its economic position in recent years and that free-market policies can take some of the credit.

""If trends continue, Chile will soon be considered one of those rare countries that has graduated out of the developing world, according to plenty of living-standard indices,"" Andres Martinez said. ""The country is also the poster child for those who believe globalization and free trade can lift living standards, as Chile's economic course has long been anchored in its free-trade agreement with the U.S. and its dynamic export sector. It also stands out among South American countries in that its governing socialists have pragmatically been the ones embracing this pro-business, market-oriented economy."" So while there is some truth to Beck's underlying point that Chile has improved its economic freedom, he's wrong to portray Chile as ranking far ahead of the United States. By several measures, the United States ranks significantly higher than Chile; in one, Chile is slightly ahead. So we find his claim Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D99640>],/factchecks/2010/jan/20/glenn-beck/beck-says-chile-easily-tops-us-economic-freedom-ra/
"['Abortion', 'National', 'Harold Ford Jr.']","
Harold Ford's comments on abortion prompt charges of flip-flopping
","There are many, many differences between New York and Tennessee. One has Jay-Z, the other the Grand Ole Opry. One has Famous Ray's Pizza, the other, Memphis barbecue. So it's not a surprise a politician running for office in Tennessee would say different things than one in New York. What's at least a little surprising, though, is that a former congressman from Tennessee -- Harold Ford Jr. -- is now considering running for Senate from New York. Ford, who served five terms in the U.S. House representing the Memphis area, ran for the U.S. Senate in Tennesee in 2006 and lost to Republican Bob Corker. Ford's family has deep roots in the Memphis area -- his House seat had previously been held by his father -- but after the Senate loss, Ford moved to New York City to be with his girlfriend (now wife). Ford is now the chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of moderate, pro-business Democrats and a senior policy adviser at Bank of America.He's considering running for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate against Kirsten Gillibrand, who was appointed to the seat by Gov. David Patterson after Hillary Clinton was named secretary of state. Gillibrand's appointment disappointed some Democrats, who believe she is too conservative on immigration and gun rights. But Ford's time in Tennessee is already coming back to haunt him. Not because he's a carpetbagger -- New York elected Robert F. Kennedy and Hillary Clinton, after all -- but because of several statements he made about abortion while running for Senate in Tennessee.There have been allegations that Ford flip-flopped, particularly after an interview last week in the New York Times. Reporter Michael Barbaro said in the interview that ""we know you describe yourself as pro-life,"" but Ford interjected: ""No, no, let's be clear.""Later in the interview, Ford elaborated: ""To say that I am pro-life is just wrong. I am personally pro-choice and legislatively pro-choice."" NARAL Pro-Choice New York, however, put out this YouTube video of Ford telling then-MSNBC host Tucker Carlson and then-Fox News host Alan Colmes during the 2006 campaign that he is ""pro-life.""Is this a classic flip-flop? Did he say one thing to appeal to the conservatives in Tennessee, and something else to strike a chord with the liberal New Yorkers? It's not that simple. Ford's actual positions on abortion didn't change at all -- just his descriptions of them. When Ford first ran for Congress, his district was safely Democratic and he ran as an abortion rights supporter. His voting record in Congress reflects this. For his five terms in the House, the National Right to Life Committee found Ford voted with the group's anti-abortion positions 5, 6, 18, 25 and 22 percent of the time. While he was running for Senate in Tennessee, Douglas Johnson, the committee's legislative director, wrote an open letter in which he said he was ""astonished"" journalists and commentators were ""unskeptically"" accepting Ford's ""pro-life"" declarations when ""his claim ... cannot survive 10 minutes study of his actual voting record.""But at the other end of the spectrum, NARAL Pro-Choice America isn't enamored with Ford, either. Its president, Nancy Keenan, said in a statement last week that Ford ""did not have a consistently pro-choice record,"" and made clear the organization was supporting Gillibrand. Why are both sides unhappy? Ford isn't a purist on abortion rights. He supports them generally, but he also voted to ban late-term abortions and to require parental notification for girls under 18 seeking abortions. He's held those positions consistently, but has alternated between describing them as ""pro-choice"" or ""pro-life.""Ford's ""pro-life"" period appears to be an attempt to appeal to more conservative voters outside of his Memphis base while he was running for Senate in Tennessee. Aides also told the New York Daily News this week it was an attempt to make the ""language of life"" relevant to issues like education and health care.His two ""pro-choice"" periods come before he ran for the Senate in Tennessee and now that he may run in New York. So his descriptions have changed, but his positions haven't. We give Ford a Half-Flip.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097268400>],/factchecks/2010/jan/19/harold-ford-jr/harold-ford-flip-flopped-abortion/

Obama says Brown's voting record is not that of an independent
","In a last-minute effort to protect a Democratic Senate seat in Massachusetts, President Barack Obama sang the praises of an independent voting record. In a Boston campaign appearance on Jan. 17, 2010, for Democrat Martha Coakley, Obama took aim at her opponent, Republican Scott Brown, for voting too much along party lines in the Massachusetts Senate.""I do want somebody who's independent,"" Obama said. ""I want a senator who's always going to put the interests of working folks all across Massachusetts first -- ahead of party, ahead of special interests.""So I hear (Coakley's) opponent is calling himself an independent,"" Obama said. ""Well, you've got to look under the hood because what you learn makes you wonder. Now, as a (state) legislator, he voted with the Republicans 96 percent of the time -- 96 percent of the time. It's hard to suggest that he's going to be significantly independent from the Republican agenda. When you listen closely to what he’s been saying, it’s very clear that he’s going to do exactly the same thing in Washington.""The president's comments gave us a serious case of deja vu that sent our Flip-O-Meter spinning.But first we'll look into the accuracy of the president's claim, not only because it was disputed by Brown (and later seemingly embraced), but also because it's kind of our thing here at PolitiFact.And we found that Obama is guilty of a little cherry-picking. In September, the Coakley campaign commissioned an analysis of Brown's voting record from Insta Trac, a nonpartisan Massachusetts legislative bill tracking service. As the Coakley campaign has hammered often, the firm found that since 2007, Brown has voted with the Republican Senate Minority Leader Richard Tisei 96 percent of the time. But Brown has been in the Massachusetts Senate since 2004, and he voted with Tisei's predecessor, Brian Lees, 82 percent of the time. We verified those numbers with Insta Trac president Michael Segal.Also, Brown served for six years in the Massachusetts House, and according to Insta Trac statistics, he voted with Republican leadership there about 92 percent of the time. We tallied all of Brown's votes in the state House and Senate (3,104 votes in all) and confirmed the Coakley campaign's claim that he has voted with Republican leadership 90 percent of the time as a state legislator. We think that probably would be a fairer number for Obama to cite, unless he qualified that he was just talking about Brown's voting record over the past two years.But our aim here is not to quibble with Obama's number. Rather it's that Obama was citing these voting records to dispel Brown's claims of independence.Indeed, that 96 percent figure Obama cited rang a bell with us at PolitiFact. That's the percentage Obama himself voted with the Democrats when he was in the U.S. Senate. We happen to know that number because we fact-checked Sarah Palin's claim about it from the vice presidential debate in 2008. She earned a True.It's based on a calculation of party unity from Congressional Quarterly that measures how often members vote with their party on bills where the parties split. Presumably, that percentage would be much higher if you included all votes (even ones where Democrats and Republicans alike supported a bill) -- such as Brown's number does.Asked about that voting record on ABC's This Week on Sept. 7, 2008, Obama defended his record and said that host George Stephanopoulos was ""conflating two arguments. One argument is bipartisanship. One argument has to do with change.""""Who is the more likely to break with their party?"" Stephanopoulos asked. ""Well, no. That wasn't the question, right? That's not the point,"" Obama said. ""The point is if you believe that George Bush has run this economy into the ground and mismanaged our foreign policy, who's more likely to change those policies? And I don't think there's any dispute that that would be me. Now, if it has to do with who has broken with their party, the first couple of years that I was in the Senate, the Republicans controlled the agenda, which meant that most of those votes are votes against efforts by the Republicans on issues that I feel very strongly about. So I have no problem defending a record of saying, no, we shouldn't cut benefits to vulnerable populations. No, I don't think that we should suspend habeas corpus, critical issues."" Earlier in the campaign, Obama dismissed as ""silly"" a rating by the National Journal that concluded he was more liberal than Ted Kennedy. Obama said some of the votes the National Journal considered liberal had bipartisan appeal. Yet in Brown's case, all votes, including bipartisan procedural ones, would count as votes in lockstep with party leaders.So pot, meet kettle. During the presidential campaign, Obama defended his 96 percent record as a strong stand for his principles. But when Brown has the same rating in Masschusetts, he's not independent enough. That earns Obama a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D8F2C0>],/factchecks/2010/jan/18/barack-obama/obama-says-browns-voting-record-not-independent/

Perry campaign says in blog that Trans-Texas Corridor is dead
","Eight years after Gov. Rick Perry proudly introduced his plan for the future of transportation in Texas, his campaign declared that vision null and void in a blog post during the Republican gubernatorial debate Thursday night.
 
""The Trans-Texas Corridor is dead,"" said the post, which was entered at 7:26 p.m.

The TTC -- unveiled in January 2002 as an approximately $200 billion plan for 4,000 miles of toll roads, rail lines and utility lines criss-crossing Texas in bundles -- has become an issue in the GOP primary contest between Perry, U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and Debra Medina, a businesswoman from Wharton. Hutchison has released online ads alleging that the controversial initiative, which drew the wrath of Perry opponents and some allies, is alive and well. One of the most vocal critics of the corridor idea was the Texas Farm Bureau, because it would have required the state to acquire a considerable amount of farmland.

We decided to investigate the health of the Trans-Texas Corridor.

The Texas Department of Transportation pronounced the TTC dead, in concept and in name, in January 2009. But some remnants of the project are still on the books.

For one, the Trans-Texas Corridor concept remains in the state’s Transportation Code and other official documents, which Hutchison says is evidence that the project endures. An attempt to remove those references failed during the 2009 legislative session with the death of a measure regulating the Texas Department of Transportation.

As for the road projects that were envisioned under TTC, only two were still kicking after January 2009: the centerpiece, a tollway twin to the Interstate 35 corridor that would run from Dallas to San Antonio, and Interstate 69 between the Rio Grande Valley and Texarkana.

But the I-35 twin was buried in October 2009 when a state environmental study of several years’ duration concluded with a ""no-build"" recommendation. The only vestige of that plan is the 49 northernmost miles of the Texas 130 tollway, which skirts the Austin area’s eastern edge from Georgetown to Mustang Ridge, and another 40 miles south from there to Seguin that are under construction by a private consortium. However, that project was under way before Perry proposed the TTC.

The I-69 project lives on and is currently in the planning stages.

However, two years earlier, in 2007, the Legislature dealt a major blow to one of the main tenets of the TTC — for the state to issue long-term leases to private companies to build and operate toll roads — by placing a moratorium on new public-private toll road partnerships, with several exceptions. That moratorium in effect became permanent last year when the Legislature failed to extend the authority for such leases beyond Sept. 1, 2009.

The roads in the corridor plan technically could be built without public-private partnerships, but the state doesn’t have the money to do so. In any case, rural opposition to building any sort of twin roads to interstates was at the heart of the plan’s collapse.

The I-69 initiative was one of the exceptions to the moratorium, but only a section of the approximately 600-mile road, the piece south of Refugio, can be a public-private partnership. And Chris Lippincott, a TxDOT spokesman, said that the decisions about exactly where the road will go and whether it will be tolled have not yet been made. The Texas Transportation Commission ordered that the road be laid down over existing highways, with free frontage roads alongside, except in areas where there is not an existing highway. This is much different from the original Perry concept of entire new road, rail and utility corridors.

Texas still has a long-term transportation plan, but it’s not the TTC. In a January 2009 statement describing the changes being made to TTC, Amadeo Saenz, executive director of TxDOT, said that the new plan would be called Innovative Connectivity in Texas/Vision 2009 and that any projects that had existed under TTC, such as an I-35 twin, would be developed individually, if they happened at all.

Summing up: We found that some language in the state Transportation Code and the much-altered highway I-69 project survive from Perry’s original TTC vision. But its centerpiece paralleling I-35 is truly dead, and beyond that, the corridor plan retains only a faint statutory pulse. We rate Perry’s statement as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976BF980>],/factchecks/2010/jan/18/rick-perry/perry-campaign-says-blog-trans-texas-corridor-dead/
"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Fla. Republican Rubio says close to half of illegal immigrants entered the U.S. legally
","Florida U.S. Senate hopeful Marco Rubio has hit the big time -- Glenn Beck's radio program. During a wide-ranging interview on Jan. 14, 2010, Beck told Rubio that illegal immigration would be the big issue of the fall 2010 election. Rubio responded that he thinks Republicans need to be the party that supports and promotes legal immigration. Then, he added: ""Close to half of the folks in this country illegally, entered legally (but) overstayed (their) visas,"" Rubio said. ""So we've got to get a hold of this visa program, too."" Rubio, the son of Cuban-born parents, claims people remaining in the United States on expired visas are nearly as big a problem as people illegally crossing the U.S. border. Is he right? The border, of course, continues to be the dominant symbol of the immigration debate (see phrases ""secure the border"" and ""border fence"" for proof), but more and more questions are being asked about people who enter the United States legally but fail to leave when they should. At least four of the 9/11 terrorists were in America on expired visas, and the government has been criticized for lacking a system that can track or even count the number of people living in the country on expired visas. To back Rubio's claim, spokesman Alex Burgos directed us to a 2006 National Public Radio report about illegal immigration. The report, filed from the U.S.-Mexico border in Douglas, Ariz., said that ""nearly half the 12 million people illegally in the country didn't cross the desert or pay a smuggler ... they crossed legally at a point of entry."" The NPR story points to a study conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center, a group that examines the U.S. Hispanic population. The Pew report, published in May 2006, indeed concludes that 40 to 50 percent of people living in the United States illegally entered the country legally through ports of entry. The percentages are right in line with what Rubio suggested on the Beck program. How did Pew get there? Pew relied on a 1997 Immigration and Naturalization Service report that attempted to quantify the number of people overstaying visas. The INS report tried to match arrival and departure documents of people entering and leaving the United States to calculate how many people were living in the country on expired visas or expired border crossing cards. It concluded that in 1996, 41 percent of illegal immigrants had entered the country legally. That data became the baseline for future government studies. Both the Department of Homeland Security and the General Accounting Office took the data collected by the INS (now Citizenship and Immigration Services), and tried to extrapolate their own estimates. The Department of Homeland Security released a report in January 2003 that found 33 percent of the illegal immigrant population in 2000 had entered the country legally. Trying to make the same estimate, the General Accounting Office produced three percentages using different methodology. In one case, the GAO used a survey of more than 1,000 adult green-card holders finding that of the 300 who admitted once being in the country illegally, 31 percent said they had overstayed their visas. In a second scenario, the GAO used arrest data on a group of 917 illegal immigrants and found that 246, or 27 percent, had been in the United States on expired visas. A second set of arrest data provided a much different result. Of 243 cases of illegal immigrants working at retail chain stores, 138 (57 percent) had been living on outdated visas. The GAO said that the Department of Homeland Security's methodology was ""complex, indirect, and marked by potential weaknesses."" Back to the Pew estimate. Researchers at Pew say they took the 1997 government report and tried to apply it to 2005, with a few minor modifications. Pew concluded that of the then 11.5 million to 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States, 4.5 million to 6 million entered the country legally. Researchers admit it's an estimate. (The overall number of illegal residents also is an estimate, it's worth noting. According to USA Today, the department estimates the number of illegal residents by subtracting the number of foreign-born people who are in the United States legally from the Census estimate of the total foreign-born population. The most recent estimate, from January 2009, puts the number of illegal residents at about 11.6 million.) ""The government has a pretty good idea of how many people come into the country if they fill out one of the forms, but it does not have a full count of how many leave,"" the Pew report said. A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, which now includes Citizenship and Immigration Services, told PolitiFact he is unaware of any other government studies attempting to quantify the number of people overstaying their visas. Pew also says the government has not published any new estimates. We couldn't find any, either. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in December that while the government is working on a way to document, and ultimately apprehend, people overstaying their visas, one doesn't exist yet. ""I don't think that we can say with precision what percentage of visa holders are stay over,"" Napolitano told the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""But I think we can say that the issue of the visa overstays has been one of the kind of most difficult but top priority problems that we've been working on this last 10 months."" What we're left with then is a series of numbers -- all different, all educated guesses. Rubio says close to half of all illegal immigrants entered this country legally but overstayed their visas. Some estimates, by Pew and one by the GAO, support that. But others put the number lower, closer to one-third. The difference between the estimates represents about 2 million people, not an insignificant number. We can't fault Rubio for using the numbers he did. But it seems like adding a little context would be appropriate. We rate Rubio's claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978955C0>],/factchecks/2010/jan/18/marco-rubio/fla-republican-rubio-says-close-half-illegal-immig/

Brazile claims Obama's job approval rate is going up
","As Jan. 20, 2010, approaches, pundits and pollsters are scanning the numbers to see how President Barack Obama has done during his first year in office.
 
A group of news analysts discussed Obama's job approval rating Jan. 17, 2010, on ABC's This Week, and specifically focused on a new ABC-Washington Post poll conducted between Jan. 12 and 15, 2010.
 
Democratic strategist Donna Brazile said that Obama is doing the best job he can given the circumstances.
 
""He's had to inherit two wars, he's had to work with a Congress that often tries to take the lead. ... And of course he's worked against a Republican Party that was united against him and against all of his policies,"" she said. ""Despite all of that, there's some good stuff in [the poll results]. ... Not only is his job approval up but most Americans consider him a strong leader.""
 
Brazile's comment that Obama's job approval is up piqued our interest. Could the numbers be so optimistic?
 
We went back to the ABC-Washington Post poll and found that Brazile is technically correct: Obama's approval rating has increased three percentage points from 50 percent in December 2009. That was his lowest job approval rating to date, according to the same poll.
 
So, Brazile is correct that Obama is polling three points higher than he did in December. But the latest figure also falls within the poll's three-point margin of error; statistically speaking, not much has changed since December. (She was more accurate with her claim that ""most Americans consider him a strong leader."" The poll showed that overall, 63 percent of the people characterized him that way.)  To get some perspective, we looked at other recent job approval statistics.
 
Pollster.com, a Web site that aggregates polling data from numerous sources and averages the results, shows that Obama's approval rating has been increasing since December. These averages are a bit squishy because each poll has a different margin of error, but they give a good estimate of where the country stands. Fox News, for example, has Obama's approval ratings up four percentage points from November to 50 percent this month. According to Gallup, Obama's approval rating is up slightly as well. Rassmussen polling demonstrates a similar trend, though it also shows that slightly more people disapprove than approve of Obama's performance.
 
Other polls, including Quinnipiac, however, show Obama's numbers on the downturn. 
 
So, Brazile claimed that Obama's job approval ratings are improving, and generally speaking, it seems they are. But we're going to lower our rating by one notch because she based her claim on one poll in which the increase is within the margin of error. So we rate this one Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B97200>],/factchecks/2010/jan/18/donna-brazile/brazile-claims-obamas-job-approval-rate-going/
"['Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'Texas', 'Kay Bailey Hutchison']","
Hutchison says Perry was for Wall Street bailout before he was against it
","


Amid economic turmoil, the U.S. Senate voted Oct. 1, 2008, to approve a $700 billion rescue of Wall Street, a decision joined by Texas Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn.

It wasn’t long afterward that Hutchison drew the unflattering nickname of ""Kay Bailout"" from Gov. Rick Perry’s camp, which was wary of Hutchison challenging Perry for governor this year.

The two revisited the bailout vote in Thursday's GOP gubernatorial debate when Hutchison reminded Perry that he’d signed a letter sent members of Congress on the day of the pivotal Senate vote widely interpreted as urging lawmakers to proceed full speed ahead.

""You wrote a letter to Congress saying pass this bill, we need to shore up the financial markets,"" Hutchison said. ""…Governor, you asked for it too. You were for it before you were against it.""

Perry conceded that he co-wrote a letter with West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin. But, he said, the governors ""thought you were smart enough to understand what we were talking about, stop the spending and cut the taxes.""

""Governor,"" Hutchison replied, ""that’s not what the letter said.""

""I wish we’d made it a little clearer for you,"" Perry said.
Maybe Perry could have made it clearer for everybody. We wondered if Perry initially urged lawmakers to pass the bailout proposal after all.

This much is certain: On the morning of Oct. 1, 2008, the Republican Governors Association and Democratic Governors Association publicized a letter signed by their respective chairmen — Perry and Manchin — described by the groups as urging passage of an economic recovery package.

The three-paragraph letter states: ""We strongly urge Congress to leave partisanship at the door and pass an economic recovery package... If Congress does not act soon, the situation will grow appreciably worse.""

The letter doesn’t explicitly endorse the plan then before the Senate. But no other plan was in play that day amid national fears of an economic collapse. And The Associated Press cast the governors' letter as part of a frantic national push for the $700 billion bailout of Wall Street sought by President Bush.

That was before Perry issued a contradictory-sounding second statement later in the day, partly headlined: ""On Protecting Taxpayers.""

""In a free market economy,"" Perry said, ""government should not be in the business of using taxpayer dollars to bail out corporate America.""

Asked to clarify at the time what Perry wanted the Senate to do, his spokeswoman, Allison Castle, demurred. ""The senators have to make their own decisions,"" Castle said.

Hutchison spokesman Matt Mackowiak stepped into the breach, opining: ""Texans can only conclude that Gov. Perry opposes the sales tax deduction, protecting them from the Alternative Minimum Tax, extending tax credits for refinery expansion and providing over $600 million in tax credits to help rebuild Texas communities damaged by Hurricane Ike, all of which are contained in this bill.""

Asked several months ago about Perry's dual messages, Perry spokesman Mark Miner saw nothing confusing. Miner said Perry simply favored tax and spending cuts over bailouts.

""You call on Congress to take action, nine times out of 10, the action they take is wrong,"" Miner said.

After the debate, we took the candidates' advice and sought out Manchin (per Perry) and former President George W. Bush (per Hutchison) for their takes on this issue. Bush declined to comment while Manchin indicated he and Perry hadn't advocated any specific legislation.

In a comment delivered by a spokesman, Manchin said: ""You had to look at the situation our country was facing then. What we were urging was for Congress to work together in a bipartisan effort, and to follow the lead of the governors... to move the states ahead. That effort continues today.""

At the time of the Senate action in 2008, Manchin said he supported his state's two senators, who voted for the Wall Street package. But he too sounded a contradictory note: ""I do not support a bailout. Nobody supports bailing somebody out on the backs of working people … for someone to profit on Wall Street.""

All in all, it's easy to see Hutchison’s rationale for charging Perry with being for the legislation before he was against it. The Manchin-Perry letter did urge action on the day the Senate was poised to take up the bailout package.

But Perry is correct that the joint letter didn’t explicitly advocate the Senate plan. And his second Oct. 1, 2008, statement could be taken as a timely signal he didn’t want Congress to rescue Wall Street the way it did

Of course, Perry could have held his tongue entirely and spared himself the resulting questions and explanations.

In the end, we rate Hutchison’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096614080>],/factchecks/2010/jan/16/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-perry-was-wall-street-bailout-he-wa/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Stimulus', 'Karl Rove']","
Rove claims Obama has already run up more debt than Bush did in eight years
","You gotta love a good war of words between past and present presidential advisers.

The first volley in this latest ""he-said, he-said"" dust-up came from Karl Rove, former adviser to President George W. Bush, who was one of the political experts asked by the Washington Post for their opinions about how the Democratic Party should handle the midterm elections. Rove's two cents was more criticism than advice.

The Obama administration ""raised discretionary spending by 24 percent from President George W. Bush's last full-year budget and will run up more debt by October than Bush did in eight years.""

President Barack Obama's top strategist, David Axelrod, fired back with a op-ed piece in the Washington Post in which he called Rove's comments shameless in light of the fact that, ""the day the Bush administration took over from President Bill Clinton in 2001, America enjoyed a $236 billion budget surplus -- with a projected 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion. When the Bush administration left office, it handed President Obama a $1.3 trillion deficit -- and projected shortfalls of $8 trillion for the next decade."" We broke that claim down here.

In this item, we'll focus on Rove's claim.

The first part of his claim is that Obama raised discretionary spending -- federal money that Congress can adjust every year -- by 24 percent from Bush's last full-year budget.

According to the White House Office of Management and Budget's historical tables, discretionary spending will go from roughly $1.13 trillion in the 2008 fiscal year (Bush's last full year budget) to $1.41 trillion in 2010. That's a roughly 24 percent increase, so Rove has the number right.

End of story? Not quite.

Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that number can be misleading because emergency and war spending can inflate the number. He prefers to judge discretionary spending based on the budget resolutions that pass each year. By that measure, he said, discretionary spending would increase by 14 percent during the period Rove is using.

Now let's take a look at the second part of Rove's equation, the claim that Obama will run up more debt by October than Bush did in eight years. First, a quick reminder about deficits and debt: deficits refer to how much money the government spends against revenues in a year; the national debt is the cumulative amount the government owes over time.

Rove talked about the national debt. During Bush's term, from the end of 2001 until the end of 2008, the debt held by the public rose $2.5 trillion (to $5.8 trillion). According to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office in August last year, the public debt rose to $7.6 trillion in 2009 and is expected to rise to nearly $8.8 trillion by the end of the 2010 fiscal year.

So debt rose by $2.5 trillion during the Bush years from 2001 through 2008; and it is expected to rise $3 trillion in the two years under Obama. But Rove's equation assumes Obama is responsible for all of the debt accumulated in 2009 and 2010. And that's where things get messy.

Obama took office in January 2009. But the federal budget works on a fiscal year from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30 of each year. So a third of the 2009 fiscal year had passed before Obama even took office.

So the spending for 2009 was largely determined by a Congress controlled by Democrats and a Republican president. The omnibus spending bill was held over and signed by Obama, who added $20 billion in discretionary spending. But that's hardly a blip in the scheme of things.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Obama administration inherited a deficit of more than $1.2 trillion the day it walked in the door.

So the debate then becomes how much of 2009 spending ought to be credited to Bush and how much to Obama.

For example, who takes the $133 billion hit for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) spent in 2009? It was signed by Bush, but Reidl thinks Obama ought to shoulder some of that. Much of TARP's losses are due to auto company bailouts and the home loan program initiated by Obama. And who gets credit for funding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, or the $400 billion in reduced tax revenue because individual income and corporate profits have dropped due to the economic downturn?

Yes, the Obama administration tacked on an additional $115 billion in stimulus spending in 2009. And much more will be spent on the stimulus in 2010.

""It's true they've provided more money under this administration, but it's hard to say it's a Democratic policy,"" said Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal economic think tank. ""Increasing the debt is overwhelmingly the result of the recession and responding to it. To Bush's credit, they actually did what needed to be done. Debt went up a lot, but most of the reason for that is the recession and dealing with it.""

Axelrod argues that Obama also inherited Bush tax cuts and Medicare prescription drug expenses, which add about $200 billion a year to annual deficits (Axelrod called them ""unwelcome gifts that keep on giving""). Riedl argues that kind of complaint may be valid in a president's first year, but by a president's second year, he needs to take ownership of programs he has inherited. If, for example, Obama thinks the prescription drug benefits in Medicare are unaffordable, he should try to repeal them, Riedl said. If he thinks the Bush tax cuts were wrong, try to roll them back.

Any way you slice the numbers, spending is on the rise. Our biggest problem with Rove's statement is that he credits all of the debt accumulated in 2009 and 2010 to Obama, and even conservative budget analysts agree that it's fair to assign at least some of the 2009 increase to Bush. And so we rate Rove's comment Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096EB5680>],/factchecks/2010/jan/15/karl-rove/rove-claims-obama-has-already-run-more-debt-bush-d/
