Uninsured rate lowest ever, Donny Deutsch claims
","Morning Joe guest host Donny Deutsch, discussing House Speaker John Boehner’s refusal to vote on immigration reform, called out the GOP for being wrong about, well, just about everything. ""Once again the party of no,"" Deutsch said on July 1, 2014. ""The country’s will was for immigration reform, they're against it. Minimum wage, we want to raise it for everybody, another populist point of view. They don't want to do it. By the way, 13 percent of Americans, the lowest ever, are without health care. Everything is going in the right direction."" While there are several things we could fact-check from Deutsch’s comments, we were most interested in his claim that 13 percent of Americans are currently uninsured -- the lowest that figure has ever been. The poll numbers Neither Deutsch nor his press agent responded to our interview requests. But it’s likely that Deutsch is referring to a Gallup poll on the rate of uninsured Americans. The poll found that in April and May of this year, 13.4 percent of Americans were without health insurance, holding steady since open enrollment for coverage ended March 31. This is indeed the lowest rate of uninsured Americans since the poll began five years ago, besting 2008’s 14.4 percent and dropping from 2013’s peak of 18 percent. The problem is, Gallup doesn’t have numbers before 2008 -- which means there’s no way to know if it’s the lowest rate ever as Deutsch claimed. Other surveys, including from the government, also attempt to measure the percentage of Americans without health insurance. According to those surveys, the percentage of Americans without health insurance has been lower than the 13.4 percent cited by Gallup: 2001: 13.1 percent (Department of Health and Human Services National Health Survey) 2000: 13.1 percent (Census Population Survey), 13.3 percent (National Health Survey) 1999: 12.2 percent (National Health Survey) 1998: 13.3 percent (National Health Survey) 1988: 13.4 percent (Population Survey) 1987: 12.9 percent (Population Survey) 1980: 12 percent (Health and Human Services Medical Expenditure Panel Survey) 1978: 12 percent (Medical Expenditure Panel Survey) While the percentages suggest the current uninsured rate is hardly the ""lowest ever"" reported, it should be noted that it is ill-advised to compare across the polls because of the differences in methodology and timing. Gallup surveys adult Americans multiple times a year about their health insurance at the time of the survey. Gallup analyst Jeff Jones confirmed that the exact question asked was simply ""do you have health insurance""? Census data, which hasn’t caught up to Obamacare implementation, includes Americans of all ages, though both broadly define ""uninsured"" as lacking insurance at any time of the year. The Health and Human Services surveys only consider nonelderly adults (under 65), includes those with only noncomprehensive plans as ""uninsured"" (i.e. dental or vision, coverage for accidents or specific diseases), and differentiates between uninsured any time in the year, for the first part of the year, and the full year. And to make matters more complicated, the Census Bureau is changing the way it collects information on the uninsured. That means new Census Bureau data will not be comparable to old Census Bureau data. In short, year-to-year data comparisons may be a moot point so let’s look at the bigger picture. Historical trends First off, insurance coverage, let alone coverage figures, simply doesn’t go all the way back to the all-elusive ""ever."" In fact, it didn’t really exist before the 1920s. The closest thing offered was ""sickness"" insurance, which paid a worker even if he/she had to take a day off due to illness -- essentially paid sick leave. According to political economist John Murray, about a third of the industrial workforce was enrolled in these sickness funds in the 1920s. In 1929, the first insurance plan in America covered 21 days of hospitalization and was offered to Dallas teachers by Baylor University for an annual fee of $6 (about $82 today). This plan, named Blue Cross, became popular during the Great Depression. In 1940, less than 1 in 10 Americans had the plan, said economic historian Melissa Thomasson. The next two decades saw an expansion of employer-sponsored plans, incentivized by Internal Revenue Bureau Code 1954’s tax subsidy, according to Thomasson. This accounts for the employer-sponsored coverage system we all know and love today. ""Most plans were employer based and always have been because insurance companies then and now figured that only sick people would want health insurance and the plans would not be sound. This is a problem called adverse selection,"" said Thomasson. By 1959, about two-thirds of Americans were insured, according to the Department of Health and Human Services National Health Survey, though historical rates of coverage for the elderly were low.   ""Insurers could not figure out how to cover people who made lots of claims and retirees often lost their employer-provided insurance when they retired. So Medicare would have resulted in large increases in coverage,"" Murray said. With the creation of social safety net programs in 1965 -- Medicare for the elderly (over 65) and Medicaid for the poor -- more than 80 percent were insured by 1968. That same year, 96 percent of the elderly were insured, more than double that of a decade earlier.   Health and Human Services data show a decline in the percentage of uninsured nonelderly Americans from 1959 to 1980. Then, the rates began to climb, level off in the 90s, and then rise substantially circa the Great Recession. Again, this is because it all ties back to the employment-sponsored system of insurance, experts say. The higher the employment ratio is, the higher the insurance rate. But Medicaid and the recent trend of employers not offering coverage complicates this relationship. ""Unemployment doesn’t come with health insurance, unless one is poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. The 1990s was a decade of high and rising employment, and that boosted insurance coverage,"" said Brookings Institution senior fellow Henry Aaron. ""During the 2000s the employment population ratio fell and employers continued to move gradually away from offering coverage. So, both trends were negative."" As a result, all the polls we looked at indicated that post-Great Recession uninsured rates hovered above 14 percent. And though the unemployment rate has fallen in the 2010s, the employment ratio has not.  Martha Heberlein, research manager at Georgetown University Health Policy Institute, and Aaron both cite Congressional Budget Office projections of the uninsured rate leveling off in the next few years at 8 to 9 percent. Obamacare won’t be universal technically because of undocumented aliens, those excused from the mandate, and those who remain uninsured and pay a fine. Heberlein adds that the rate could decline even further if more states adopt Medicaid expansion. ""I think that the key point is not whether the insurance percentage is or is not at an all-time low today. The key points are that the Affordable Care Act reversed an upward trend and has done so emphatically and if the projections of the Congressional Budget Office are even approximately correct, the percentage will come down still more,"" Aaron said. The ruling Deutsch claimed that 13 percent of Americans, the lowest ever, are without health care. His statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. Yes, it is the lowest that Gallup has reported in its five-year poll, though other equally valid surveys show lower rates before 2008. Nonetheless, experts agree that more Americans are insured than there were in the past couple of years. Whether that’s the lowest ever is hard to say. We rate Deutsch’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097819FC0>],/factchecks/2014/jul/08/donny-deutsch/uninsured-rate-lowest-ever-donny-deutsch-claims/

Gingrich: Hillary Clinton's health plan had broad religious exemptions
","Republicans have been getting a lot of mileage out of the recent Supreme Court decision that brought a blow to the Affordable Care Act -- with the court citing a law enacted by Bill Clinton as part of its rationale. In Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby, the court said the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act allows certain corporations to opt out of providing employees with certain contraception coverage -- which were mandated by the ACA -- because of the owners’ religious beliefs. Now, former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich is saying Bill and Hillary Clinton’s health care reform plan from the 1990s also would have supported the court’s decision. In fact, Hillary Clinton’s plan -- which he calls Hillarycare -- would have been more favorable to corporations wanting to evade certain parts of Obama’s health care law. ""Hillarycare, 20 years ago, had a broader provision. The bill that (former Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.) introduced for Hillary had a broader provision in favor of corporate right to back out,"" of providing contraceptives based on religious beliefs, Gingrich said on Sunday’s ABC This Week. We showed Gingrich's statement to Sara Rosenbaum, a health policy professor at George Washington University, who played a role in drafting health care legislation for the Clinton administration. ""I have absolutely no idea what he is talking about,"" she said. So what is Gingrich talking about? The Clintons' proposed Health Security Act, proposed in 1993, would have required all employers to contribute to employees' health insurance. All benefits packages would have included coverage for ""family planning,"" including birth control. But the original proposal doesn't say anything about religious exemptions for employers. We weren't able to get a hold of Gingrich, but we think he's referring to this provision, included in a 1994 bill that Moynihan sponsored during the health care reform debate. (This bill was, however, separate from the Clintons’ plan.) Moynihan’s bill said, in part, ""Nothing in this title shall be construed to prevent any employer from contributing to the purchase of a standard benefits package which excludes coverage of abortion or other services, if the employer objects to such services on the basis of a religious belief or moral conviction."" In plain English, the law would not require an employer to utilize a benefits package that provided benefits that went against their religious or moral beliefs. Gingrich is right that this would be less restrictive than the provisions laid out by the Supreme Court in the Hobby Lobby decision, experts said. The court decision established fairly narrow restrictions for corporations looking to claim religious exemption from parts of the Affordable Care Act (though some say it creates a slippery slope). The decision said closely held corporations with strong religious convictions don’t have to offer insurance that covers four kinds of ACA-mandated contraceptives. Moynihan’s provision was less restrictive because it said employers don’t have to purchase plans that include ""abortion and other services,"" but it does not specify the other services, said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University law professor. Additionally, it includes ""moral conviction"" in addition to ""religious beliefs,"" Jost added. The Religious Freedom and Restoration Act on which the court based its decision only applies to religious beliefs. But was creating an exemption for employers based on religious beliefs a primary tenant of the Clintons' health care plan? No, it wasn’t. The Clintons’ proposal Moynihan’s bill was not put forth on the Clintons’ behalf. Their plan did not include a religious exemption for employers clause, said Chris Jennings, former health care adviser to both Clinton and President Barack Obama, in an interview. ""That was not related to the plan,"" Jennings said. In fact, Moynihan was routinely critical of the Clintons’ proposal, once calling the administration’s financing estimates ""fantasy."" Moynihan's proposal was one of several health care reform bills coming out of the 103rd Congress, and it certainly was not the one the Clintons wanted. It saw little floor time because it came up in August 1994, when the health care reform debate was winding down. No other version of the Health Security Act included a religious exemption provision for employers -- including another earlier version also sponsored by Moynihan. The primary health care bill -- sponsored by former Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. and backed by the Clintons -- included a provision that allowed health care providers to refuse to offer or perform services that went against their moral or religious beliefs, such as abortions. But the exemption did not extend to the employers contributing to health insurance costs. The congressional briefing book on the Clintons' proposed plan does not include the provision, either. Additionally, we spoke with experts who said they do not recall birth control as a major source of debate during the Clintons’ health care reform efforts. News coverage at the time seems to back that up. Contraception coverage ""hadn't emerged as a goal of reformers at that point,"" said Paul Starr, a public affairs professor at Princeton University. ""So the idea of a ‘corporate right to back out’ also hadn't come up."" Abortion coverage was the primary point of contention, in terms of family planning, rather than birth control, Rosenbaum said. It’s possible that Moynihan added a religious exemption for employers in order to appease those who didn’t want comprehensive abortion coverage. But even so, it seems unlikely that the Clintons would have budged on providing universal abortion coverage.   Around that time, Lorrie McHugh, a Clinton administration spokeswoman on health, told the New York Times that the administration stood by its original position that abortion should be covered ""where a doctor deemed it medically necessary or appropriate. … We’ll fight for it."" Our ruling Gingrich said Hillary Clinton's health care plan from the 1990s ""had a broader provision in favor of corporate right to back out"" of providing contraceptive coverage than the one created by the Hobby Lobby Supreme Court decision. We found that Sen. Moynihan did produce a health care bill, as part of widespread reform efforts, that included a religious exemption for employers that was broader than the provisions created by the court’s decision. However, Gingrich was wrong to connect that back to the Clintons. The Clintons’ health care plans did not include such a provision, and they did not back Moynihan’s bill. In fact, Moynihan was critical of the administration throughout the health care debate. Additionally, his proposal came up near the end of the reform efforts and didn’t generate much discussion. We rate Gingrich's claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/183923cd-a3bd-46d3-aca7-68b0ada766b8",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DDAD80>],/factchecks/2014/jul/08/newt-gingrich/gingrich-hillary-clintons-health-plan-had-broad-re/
"['Georgia', 'Taxes', 'Jack Kingston']","
Would David Perdue raise taxes?
","Republican candidates tend to embrace the same familiar themes. At the top, if not a desire to roll back Obamacare, would likely be the longtime GOP stance opposing any tax increase. So it’s no small thing for U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston to brand businessman David Perdue, his rival in the Republican runoff for the U.S. Senate, as a tax supporter. The ad in question, featuring a voicemail for Kingston left by a President Obama impersonator, is to the point: ""Perdue said he’d raise taxes. You never even voted for a tax increase."" The Kingston camp pointed us to two Perdue statements: one from a May meeting with the Macon Telegraph editorial board and the other from a candidate forum from January. ""Mr. Perdue has repeatedly advocated for tax increases,"" Kingston campaign manager Chris Crawford said. That seems clear enough. But digging into the details, as PolitiFact does, clouds things up a bit. Perdue, a former CEO who has built his campaign focused as an outsider to politics, told the editorial board he supported ""both"" curbing spending and increasing revenue to boost the economy. When a member of the board calls revenue increases ""a euphemism for some kind of tax increase, of course,"" Perdue talks about the need to grow business and grow revenue. Crawford notes that Perdue chuckles before he speaks but doesn’t outright deny support for a tax increase. In an interview with PolitiFact, Perdue said his point in the meeting was to focus not just on the economy but how to use the economy to help pay down the national debt. ""We can balance the budget by cutting spending, and that’s where you start,"" Perdue said. ""But an $18 trillion debt will require an economy that’s growing, with people back to work, like we did in the ‘60s, ‘80s and even the ‘90s."" An Internet sales tax, or a tax on online sales similar to those made at physical stores, would also increase revenue. Now, people who buy from online retailers are supposed to report their purchases on their state tax returns and pay. Few do. Georgia lost an estimated $410 million in uncollected online sales tax in 2012, according to a study  from the University of Tennessee’s Center for Business and Economic Research. The Marketplace Fairness Act would permit state and local governments to collect sales taxes from internet retailers that do not have a physical location in their jurisdictions. It passed the Senate last year but has been held up in the GOP-run House, with conservative members labeling it a tax hike. Perdue said at the January candidate forum that he supported the concept of the bill to make sure there was ""an even playing field"" for all retailers. ""Frankly, I think whether you have brick-and-mortar or Internet sales, we should have the same rules apply to both,"" Perdue said at the event. He recently clarified with PolitiFact that his support falls under his advocacy of a Fair Tax, which would replace existing federal income taxes with a national 23 percent sales tax on all new goods and services, including those bought on the internet. Critics the Fair Tax, note that the proposal is regressive – that is, it disproportionately hurts people with lower incomes who spend more of their wages and therefore pay a higher tax rate. Perdue acknowledges that the current proposal would need tweaks to avoid that problem. But he believes taxing consumption – including buying new products from Amazon or elsewhere on the Internet – is a change that needs to happen. ""I would argue that it would reduce taxes, because it would have greater growth in the economy,"" Perdue said. Kingston has made that argument, too, notes staffer Crawford. In fact, Kingston reiterated support for the Fair Tax during the same January forum but refused to support an internet sales tax as an incremental measure. ""If David Perdue wanted to equivocate on that, he had five months to do it,"" Crawford said. ""He didn’t until it was politically expedient and that doesn’t ring true."" Speaking of truth, where does all of this leave us on whether David Perdue would raise taxes? Basing the statement alone on Perdue’s meeting with a newspaper editorial board takes his statements out of context. Equating revenue increases with tax hikes is a stretch that breaks upon closer examination. Perdue is far more clear, though, on support for extending sales taxes to goods and services bought online. Though the Fair Tax includes such a tax as part of its proposal, there is a separate bill that would levy the Internet sales tax in the exact way that Perdue said he supported. Taken together, we rate the claim Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097136B00>],/factchecks/2014/jul/08/jack-kingston/would-david-perdue-raise-taxse/

Rick Scott cut education to pay for tax breaks, Democratic Party ad says
","A new Florida Democratic Party TV ad accuses Gov. Rick Scott of siding with big business rather than public education. ""He didn’t side with students and parents when Rick Scott cut education funding by over a billion dollars,"" the narrator says in the ad, which began airing in the Tampa, West Palm Beach and Orlando markets in early July. ""Working and middle-class families? Nope. Not on their side when Scott’s cuts forced tuition increases at 11 Florida universities. Why would he do it? Whose side was Rick Scott on? Scott cut education to pay for even more tax breaks for big, powerful, well-connected corporations. With his education cuts and tuition increases, Rick Scott’s not on your side."" We’ve already fact-checked claims about education cuts and tuition in the gubernatorial battle between Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist, the Democratic frontrunner. Here we will fact-check the claim that ""Scott cut education to pay for even more tax breaks for big, powerful, well-connected corporations."" Education cuts Scott entered office in 2011 facing a $3.6 billion shortfall which led him and the Legislature to cut K-12 by $1.3 billion. (Scott actually wanted a bigger cut.) After facing a backlash, Scott sought increases in later fiscal years. The amount of K-12 spending approved by the Legislature this year will be a record in terms of total dollars. However, per-pupil spending is less than the amount in 2007-08, when Crist was governor. In 2012, the state cut about $304 million for universities, under the assumption that they would increase tuition by as much as 15 percent. The following year, lawmakers restored that money. This year, the Legislature and Scott lowered that cap to 6 percent and eliminated it for all but University of Florida and Florida State University. Business tax breaks So that’s how Scott handled education spending. What about tax breaks for corporations? A spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party pointed to a Miami Herald article about business tax breaks approved in 2012. However, it’s worth noting that those tax breaks benefited a broad array of businesses -- not only ones that were big, powerful or well-connected, as the ad claims.   ""From shop owners, who know little about Tallahassee politics, to the powerful business lobby that thought up many of carefully crafted tax breaks, the Legislature this year proved a friendly place,"" the Herald wrote. This business tax relief totaled about $750 million in the first year, and more than $2.5 billion over the next three years, the Herald reported. That fit in line with Scott’s campaign promises to expand employment as Florida continued to bounce back from the recession. The cuts included a $50,000 exemption to the corporate income tax and tax breaks for manufacturing equipment and for private planes. The Herald cited a couple of examples of businessmen who would benefit, including Frank Stronach, a billionaire horse breeder whose Gulfstream Park racetrack casino had a team of nine lobbyists in Tallahassee. ""He is likely to benefit from corporate tax cuts for his businesses and a $1.2 million tax break carved out specifically for a slaughterhouse he is building near Ocala,"" the Herald wrote. The Orlando Sentinel cited other beneficiaries, including big telecom companies that won tax breaks and a Palm Beach Gardens-based engine manufacturer that got a sales tax break that could save it $900,000 a year. Did Scott cut money for schools to bail out corporations? Finally, is there any connection between the cuts in education spending and the tax breaks Scott implemented? The K-12 education cut did occur in 2011, and so did the university cut in 2012 -- the same year the tax breaks passed. Joshua Karp, a spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party, told PolitiFact Florida that the two are inevitably linked. ""If you increase funding in one part of general revenue, you inevitably have to cut from somewhere else,"" he said. ""He could have chosen to put education first and found other places to cut."" Independent analysts see greater room for nuance. The chronology of the cuts makes it difficult to draw any cause-and-effect conclusions. ""I don’t think it is a one-for-one comparison, in that they didn’t stand around saying we will cut education to give these tax cuts,"" said Kim Rueben, state finance expert at the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. ""But given balanced budget rules and a need to pay for all spending with revenues, the folks who passed the tax cuts must have had some idea that some spending would need to be cut."" Kurt Wenner -- vice president of tax research at Florida TaxWatch, a group that takes a critical look at state spending with an eye toward long-term savings -- also saw a gray area. ""At best, it is an oversimplification of a very complex budget process to say education funding was reduced to pay for tax cuts,"" Wenner said. ""There are so many factors that affect funding levels. The 2012 Legislature also swept $542 million from trust funds into general revenue. It could be argued that this more than paid for any tax cuts. Conversely, the Legislature, wisely, chose to significantly increase reserves that year. That had a much bigger impact on available funding than the tax cuts did."" Our ruling A TV ad by the Florida Democratic Party says Scott ""cut education to pay for even more tax breaks for big, powerful, well-connected corporations."" Scott and the Legislature did cut K-12 in 2011 and money for universities in 2012. And Scott and the Legislature implemented a series of business tax breaks in 2012. However, the ad exaggerates when it focuses attention on tax breaks for ""big, powerful, well-connected corporations."" Some such companies benefited, but so did many other types of businesses. And the question of whether the tax cuts and the education cuts had any causal relationship is murkier than the ad lets on. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C31E540>],/factchecks/2014/jul/07/florida-democratic-party/rick-scott-cut-education-pay-tax-breaks-democratic/
"['Georgia', 'Military', 'Jack Kingston']","
Kingston's attack on Obama's military plans lacks context
","As Georgia’s U.S. Senate race heats up, Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah has not been shy about his disdain for the policies touted by the current presidential administration. He has railed against Pres. Barack Obama’s Affordable Health Care Act, saying it needs to be repealed and replaced. In television and radio ads he has played the part of playful provocateur, hiring a voice actor to play a pleading facsimile of the president. If you’ve hopped in your car for even a quick lunch break the last few days, you’ve probably heard this ad. However, it’s another Kingston ad that has us at PolitiFact wondering. In a spot titled, ""Backward Priorities,"" Kingston takes aim at federal cuts to the defense budget. ""Pres. Obama has it all wrong. He’s growing government with wasteful spending while drastically cutting our military, leaving us with the lowest number of active-duty troops since before World War II,"" Kingston says in the ad posted on his campaign’s YouTube channel on May 12. ""Obama’s backwards priorities puts us all at risk."" Kingston goes on to tout his own track record on military bases in Georgia, but this statement made us press the pause button. Is it true that troops are at their lowest since WWII? And if so, are we really at risk? We asked Chris Crawford, Kingston’s campaign spokesman, for the source behind the ad. Crawford forwarded us to a February press release from the Department of Defense, which detailed Pres. Obama’s proposed Pentagon budget for fiscal year 2015. Amidst the cuts were a series of reductions which included ""shrinking the Army to its smallest size since before World War II."" The proposal would shave off 15 percent of active-duty personnel over five years, from 520,000 to between 440,000 and 450,000. It acknowledged the fiscal reasoning behind the decision, noting cuts made through the Budget Control Act of 2011 ($487 billion over 10 years) and sequestration ($50 billion annually). Right off the bat, Kingston’s ad faces a problem. The 2015 fiscal year budget has a proposed five-year plan for military cuts – it hasn’t actually occurred yet, and will have to be approved by Congress. So Obama has not yet left the country with the lowest number of troops since WWII, even if he has proposed such cuts, though they are likely to go through given the fiscal constraints on the Pentagon. Crawford said this about the budget:  But  how do the numbers compare with past deployments? The folks at PolitiFact Wisconsin compiled a list of Army figures going back to 1775 while conducting a fact check of similar comments made by Wisconsin Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner. Kingston said active-duty troops will decrease to pre-WWII levels. On first blush, that seems true. That list, citing the Secretary of War Annual Report and Strength of the Army Reports, shows that in 1940, there were 264,118 active-duty troops. In 1941, after the United States joined the war following Pearl Harbor, that number shot up to 1.5 million troops. Kingston’s phrasing could use some fine-tuning. He seems to imply that the number of troops will be around 1940 levels through his comparison. But they are actually much closer to the numbers seen in the late 1990s and even early 2000s. There were only 479,026 active troops in 2000, and from 1998 to 2001, the number stayed close to 480,000. The current numbers are low, but historically speaking, they aren’t that low – especially when considering the nation’s unstable finances .Now for the second question: what risk does a smaller military pose for U.S. citizens? That’s a bit less cut and dry. Center for a New American Security fellow Travis Sharp addressed the issue in a policy brief, noting that the comparison to 1940 was ""interesting,"" but ""not particularly useful."" ""Since the 2014 Army is not going to fight in the 1940 strategic environment,"" Sharp wrote, ""comparing them does not help us decide what to do today."" He writes later that size does matter in many combat operations, but that decreasing ground forces in peacetime is ""both precedented and logical,"" given budgetary concerns. For its part, the Defense Department report states that active duty strength will diminish, but will be replaced with continued investments in cyber capabilities, missile defense and nuclear deterrence. We called Ricky Smith, a senior army official and director of the Army Capabilities Integration Center, a military think tank, to get his take about the connection between today’s troops and their 1940 counterparts. ""It really is an apples to oranges comparison. The quality of today’s individual soldier is so much higher than it was,"" Smith said. ""What they’re able to do the squad level, versus World War II, is amazing."" Smith said the Army should still be able to handle single operations, but might struggle from its diminished force when attempting to fight in multiple arenas, like when U.S. troops fought in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Technology does decrease the need for on-the-ground troops, but those units are also still necessary for the vast majority of tasks. The military’s status as a global force may be lessened by cuts. ""You ultimately have to have some kind of human contact,"" Smith said. ""There’s something to be said about putting boots on the ground and having tanks."" But that desire is balanced with fiscal realities. ""By reducing our capacity, you are in some ways accepting risk,"" Smith said. ""The question is, what is prudent risk?"" In short, Kingston accused the Obama administration of reducing active troops to pre-WWII levels and putting ""us all"" at risk. While it is true that the numbers are at their lowest since 1940, they are substantively similar to the active enrollment numbers seen in the 1990s and early 2000s. Changing technologies and strategies for deployment make the comparison to the pre-Pearl Harbor days a bit of a stretch. The reduction of active troops has a clear effect on the scope of missions the United States can take on globally. But whether citizens at home are seeing a greater risk is less clear. Though Kingston’s ad contains some truth there is a lot of context missing. We rate Kingston’s claim Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280FFB52900>],/factchecks/2014/jul/07/jack-kingston/kingstons-attack-obamas-miltary-plans-misfires/
"['Abortion', 'National', 'Justin Amash']","
Justin Amash says pro-life group rates him the top Michigan conservative
","The common narrative in the ongoing battle for control of the Republican Party usually involves a grassroots conservative challenging the GOP incumbent in a primary. We’ve seen it already this cycle in Virginia and Mississippi. But the storyline comes with a twist in western Michigan, where Rep. Justin Amash, a tea party favorite, is the one facing a tough test from establishment-backed candidate Brian Ellis. With a significant lead in the race, Amash is on the offensive with a new ad that looks to bolster his conservative credentials while attacking the record of his opponent. ""Justin Amash is rated Michigan’s No. 1 conservative,"" the narrator says, while the names of several groups pop across the screen: National Right to Life, Club for Growth and FreedomWorks. FreedomWorks and Club for Growth have consistently backed Amash. But where does Amash stand with the anti-abortion National Right to Life? Will Adams, a spokesman for Amash, pointed us to the National Right to Life Committee’s legislative scorecard for the 113th Congress (i.e. since 2012). The group tracks votes important to their cause and rates lawmakers on how they vote. The pro-life committee says Amash is 4 for 4, so 100 percent. But, as we learned, that’s only part of the story. First, if this is the measure by which ""Michigan’s No. 1 conservative"" is determined, then Amash is in an eight-way tie with all of Michigan’s Republican congressman. Each of them also received 100 percent on their National Right to Life scorecard. Second, if we go back to the scorecard from the previous Congress, Amash actually had one of the lowest ratings in the Republican caucus. On 10 votes, Amash received a negative score on three votes supported by the National Right to Life Committee — two for voting present, one for voting against the legislation. Only six Republicans scored lower. Amash, who says he is 100 percent pro-life, explained many of those votes on his Facebook page, where the two-term congressman almost always describes his position on legislation. Two of the votes, which went toward legislation to defund Planned Parenthood, Amash was against because it didn’t strip funding from all abortion providers. He voted present. ""Legislation that names a specific private organization to defund (rather than all organizations that engage in a particular activity) is improper and arguably unconstitutional,"" Amash wrote. ""Moreover, the legislation is easily thwarted because the organization may simply change its name."" On the third item, an amendment to ban sex-selective abortion, Amash voted ""no."" He said the bill ""criminalizes the motive for getting an abortion. In other words, it keeps all abortions legal except those obtained for the ‘wrong’ reasons."" These explanations did not appear to appease the National Right to Life Committee, which favored all three measures. In 2012, Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the group, told the evangelical newspaper The Christian Post, ""With such a record, he is unlikely to rally pro-life support to his new flag — a flag that seems designed mostly to cover his backside back home."" The national group has so far not endorsed a candidate in the race (they have made endorsements in 20 primaries nationwide). But the state affiliate, Right to Life of Michigan, has: They backed Ellis over Amash. The state group also withdrew support from Amash in 2012. Lastly, we reached out to a spokesman for National Right to Life. They said they have no distinction of ""No. 1 conservative."" ""National Right to Life has not rated anyone, including Rep. Amash, as a ‘No. 1 conservative,’"" Derrick Jones said. ""Nor does National Right to Life rate members of congress in terms of ‘conservative’ or ‘liberal.’"" Adams, Amash’s spokesman, said it was ""fair to lump a good pro-life rating in with our description"" as top conservative because ""self-identified conservatives poll overwhelmingly pro-life."" That may be true, though by National Right to Life’s scorecard, it is not uncommon for a handful of Democrats to score higher than Republicans. In the last Congress, some Democrats even scored equal to or higher than Amash. Our ruling Amash’s ad claimed he was ""rated Michigan’s No. 1 conservative"" by several groups, including National Right to Life. While he has voted with the group this Congress, they ranked his record near the bottom of the GOP caucus from 2011 to 2012. Though he explained the times when he went against the group, it ultimately did not change their rating and clearly angered the organization. Amash’s ad implies approval from a group that has criticized his voting record, and whose state affiliate is backing his opponent. We rate Amash's statement False.

Ted Cruz incorrectly says Barack Obama has promised amnesty to illegal immigrants
","U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, recently emerged from observing Central American children being held at Lackland Air Force Base and declared related border crossings were surging because of a protective offer from President Barack Obama. Children from Central American countries and others have established a record flow across the Rio Grande, we recently found. Accounts have varied on why more are coming than before. For instance, a June 16, 2014, National Journal news story quoted Leslie Velez, a senior protection officer at the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, as saying its 2014 interviews of 404 children revealed many were fleeing violence and crime in their home countries. Cruz, addressing reporters a week before Obama asked Congress for more money and authority to make it easier to deport recent border crossers, said a survey showed that 95 percent of the immigrants were saying ""we are coming because we've been promised amnesty."" We rated this Half True; the statistic was right, but the use of the word ""amnesty"" wasn't. The survey and respondents used the word ""permiso,"" which is a notice given to unaccompanied children enabling them to stay in the country until their cases get a review. That doesn't amount to amnesty. After mentioning such expectations of amnesty, Cruz went on to say: ""That’s the message that’s being heard. And the reason these children are coming in staggering numbers is because the president has been promising amnesty."" Wait: Has the Democratic president been promising amnesty? Defining amnesty Before we get to Cruz’s backup information, it’s worth remembering how ""amnesty"" has been defined per illegal immigrants. A legal dictionary defines amnesty as ""a blanket abolition of an offense by the government, with the legal result that those charged or convicted have the charge or conviction wiped out. ... The basis for amnesty is generally because the war or other conditions that made the acts criminal no longer exist or have faded in importance. Over the past few decades, the benchmark for amnesty for immigrants has been the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That measure, signed into law by President Ronald Reagan, permitted illegal immigrants to become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in the country by 1982 and met minimal other requirements. The law was widely described as an amnesty program. Its failure to stem the flow of illegal immigration is one reason ""amnesty"" became a politically poisonous term. In June 2013, the Democratic-majority Senate, with some Republican support, approved an immigration measure creating a pathway for some unauthorized residents to achieve legal status. It hasn’t advanced in the Republican-steered House. Before the Senate action, PolitiFact rated as Half True a claim the Senate plan didn’t give amnesty to unauthorized residents. The plan offers a multi-year pathway to legal status and eventually citizenship, yet applicants would face fines, background checks and waiting periods. Also, only individuals in the country by the end of 2011 would qualify. Cruz cites Obama action in 2012 By email, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said Cruz was referring to a 2012 Obama administration decision not to deport certain youths living in the country illegally and to the president’s repeated praise of a stalled proposal (the DREAM act) that, if passed into law, would give children living here without legal authorization opportunities to seek legal residency and citizenship. On June 15, 2012, Obama followed up on an announcement by Janet Napolitano, secretary of homeland security, by telling reporters: ""Over the next few months, eligible individuals who do not present a risk to national security or public safety will be able to request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization."" Napolitano had said the government would use ""prosecutorial discretion"" not to deport certain children living in the U.S. without authorization, specifying the policy would apply only to individuals who came to the United States before they turned 16 and before June 2007--plus there were other conditions. ""This is not amnesty,"" Obama said. ""This is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It’s not a permanent fix. This is a temporary, stopgap measure that lets us focus our resources wisely while giving a degree of relief and hope to talented, driven, patriotic young people. It is the — it is the right thing to do."" Regardless of Obama’s not-amnesty insistence, Frazier suggested his approval of the announcement sent an amnesty message far and wide. There ""is nothing on paper that ends this policy,"" Frazier wrote. ""It is indefinite until someone else comes in and decides to finally enforce the law. And he may say it's not amnesty, but we argue it is – his policies make it clear that people who have come here illegally are allowed to stay with no threat of deportation."" Frazier later singled out a June 2011, memo from the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement urging agency officials to use discretion in deciding which apprehended violators of immigration law should be removed from the country, taking particular care with veterans, long-time legal permanent residents, minors, elderly individuals, pregnant or nursing women and individuals here since childhood, among particular people. Outside experts We asked outside experts if they were aware of Obama promising amnesty. By telephone, Marc Rosenblum of the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that studies worldwide immigration, said a longstanding U.S. policy has contributed to unaccompanied children fleeing the violence-afflicted countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras for this country, but Cruz may have singled out the wrong president. Rosenblum told us the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2008, affirmed an existing policy requiring officials to enable unaccompanied children entering from countries other than Canada and Mexico to stay here long enough to seek asylum. Notably, Rosenblum said, the law requires such children to be placed in the least restrictive setting, which typically ends up being a family member already here. ""It’s not that kids are responding to misinformation"" about Obama’s actions, Rosenblum said. ""They’re  responding to accurate information about what’s happening to people who have come… Almost all of the children from Central America who are arriving are still here."" Cruz, Rosenblum said, is ""correct U.S. policies are a contributing factor. He’s just identifying the wrong policy."" By email, Frazier of Cruz’s office didn't dispute the significance of the 2008 act, but she suggested it alone doesn’t explain the spike in children coming from countries south of Mexico since Obama became president. By email, Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that supports reduced immigration, said: ""Most of the kids are coming because their parents made arrangements because they understand that the kids will be released to them with no questions asked, no risk to the parents or kids of enforcement.  The parents don't know about the legal issues, just the results, until the kid is provided with a lawyer to ask for asylum or special juvenile status. "" Vaughan said she doesn’t view the notices given to children illegally entering the country freeing them to stay with relatives or others until a hearing as amnesty, because each child is offered only the opportunity to appear in court and argue why they should be allowed to stay legally. ""They are not absolved, they are allowed argue for relief, which may or may not be granted,"" Vaughan wrote. She added, though, that whether ""or not this mass issuance of"" notices to appear at hearings ""turns into a de facto amnesty remains to be seen and depends on how aggressively the Obama administration manages these cases."" Our ruling Cruz said children are coming into the U.S. in ""staggering numbers"" because  President Barack Obama ""has been promising amnesty."" We suppose the government’s 2012 declaration it wouldn’t deport certain young residents already here by 2007 might be misinterpreted as an everlasting amnesty signal by some. But Obama hasn’t offered amnesty to anyone. Other factors in children streaming north from Central America include home-country conditions and a policy reaffirmed by Congress before Obama became president enabling unaccompanied children from places other than Canada and Mexico to settle here with family members or others while waiting for immigration cases to be heard.

Chris Abele says polls show strong support in Milwaukee County for $10.10 minimum wage
","Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele backs an increase in Wisconsin’s minimum wage from the current $7.25 to $10.10 an hour. But he thinks it’s a waste of taxpayer dollars to ask Milwaukee County voters whether they agree. The County Board voted 13-4 on June 26, 2014 to place a non-binding referendum question on the Nov. 4 ballot to gauge support for the state to enact a $10.10 minimum wage. Some board members say a referendum will drum up support for that level at the state and federal levels. Critics say the referendum is aimed more at driving up turnout on the left in order to help Democrats running in November. Days before the County Board vote, Abele was lobbying supervisors against the move, saying that, when combined with three other referenda, it could cost the county $75,000 to $120,000 in administrative costs. In a June 24, 2014 email and letter posted the next day on Facebook, Abele wrote: ""I am worried that we are spending much needed tax dollars on a question that we already know the outcome. One poll conducted by UWM earlier this month shows broad support for raising the minimum wage."" According to that poll, Abele wrote, ""76% of registered voters support raising the state’s minimum wage. That poll is another strong indicator of what citizens think and it does not require us to dip into our emergency fund to pay for it."" Statewide polls, including the one Abele cited, clearly have shown broad support for some increase in the minimum wage. But what do these survey say specifically about $10.10, and about the opinions of Milwaukee County residents? To the numbers As one piece of backup, Abele cited the UWM Wisconsin Economic Scorecard poll, which  found the 76 percent statewide figure. And he pointed us to a Marquette Law School poll in March that found 63 percent support statewide for the general notion of an increase, vs. 33 percent opposed. The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee poll was conducted by the university’s Center for Urban Initiatives & Research from June 2 to June 5 with a statewide sample of 569 registered voters. It also polled on the issue  in March 2014. The Marquette Law School polls on the issue were conducted in January and March 2014, also among registered voters. There is a strong suggestion in the June UWM statewide poll result that a strong majority of Milwaukee County residents would back some increase. A raise won support from 61 percent of Republicans statewide, 70 percent of independents and 94 percent of Democrats. Milwaukee County tilts strongly Democratic. Still, the results Abele references from those polls weren’t specific to $10.10, or to Milwaukee County. Peeling back the layers So let’s peel back a few layers in those and a couple other polls to get to the core. More than three-quarters of Milwaukee County respondents (77 percent) backed some bump in the wage in the UWM June poll, according to Joseph Cera, survey center director at UWM. The margin of error for the county subsample is 10.7 percent. In the MU poll, 69 percent in Milwaukee County supported an unspecified raise. The margin of error there was 6.2 percent. And here’s the key finding: Among Milwaukee County respondents, the March UWM poll found that 56 percent of registered voters would support a state minimum wage of $10.10, according to Cera. The margin of error is large (11.6 percent), however, due to a small sample size. That result mirrors the statewide picture. In the March UWM poll, 57 percent supported $10.10 when asked specifically about that amount. We found two polling questions that asked about increases in the minimum wage within certain ranges. In June, the UWM survey asked an open-ended question asking what the minimum wage should be. The answers were reported in 25-cent groupings. Among Milwaukee County respondents, the single most common was in the $9.76-$10.00 range; the median response for Milwaukee County fell in the $9.26-$9.50 range. Here’s the breakdown for Milwaukee County: -- 44.5 percent said $9.76-10.01, or higher (including 17.1 percent over $11.00) -- 35.4 percent said $8.01 to $9.75 -- 6.9 percent said $7.26 to $8.00 --12.6 percent said $7.25 or less A January MU poll showed a similar result for Milwaukee County: 49 percent want an increase of about $10 or more. While those results show a big majority for a sizeable boost in the wage, they don’t suggest a majority for $10.10. How is it that 56 percent supported $10.10 in one UWM poll, but in another UWM poll and in the MU poll, when asked to pick the ideal increase, less than 50 percent chose the $10 or higher range? Cera wasn’t surprised at the apparent contradiction. Many of those who ideally would want an increase to something less than $10.10 still back $10.10 when that is the only option presented, Cera said. That, of course, is the situation in the referendum question, so the March UWM poll result is instructive, Cera said. Cera told us that as a statistician, his conclusion is that it’s very likely a majority of Milwaukee County voters would support $10.10. He offered an additional caveat beyond the large margin of error: A referendum is not a survey. Election turnout can vary depending on the intensity of races on the ballot. It can also skew to wealthier residents, who might be less inclined to favor a large bump in the wage. That could slightly bring down the numbers in favor of $10.10 when voters cast ballots on the question, Cera said. Our rating Abele said a statewide poll showing 76% support for a minimum wage hike is a ""strong indicator,"" along with other surveys, of deep public support in Milwaukee County for a $10.10 wage. The poll number he cites is out of context because it’s a statewide result and didn’t refer specifically to $10.10. If given a choice to set the wage wherever they want it, a majority might not back $10.10, two polls of county residents show. But there’s some survey evidence that in a referendum specifically on $10.10, a solid majority in Milwaukee County would back that idea. Foolproof conclusions can’t be drawn because of the small size of the sample at the county level. On balance, we rate Abele’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A40B280>],/factchecks/2014/jul/07/chris-abele/chris-abele-says-polls-show-strong-support-milwauk/

Greg Abbott sustained four setbacks in court, though he claims a win in Supreme Court EPA case
","State Sen. Wendy Davis wink-admonished delegates to last month’s Texas Democratic Party convention not to ""clap too much"" for her ""or Greg Abbott will sue you."" Davis, the party’s nominee for governor, then noted that Abbott, the state attorney general and Republican gubernatorial choice, often boasts about going to work, suing the federal government and going home. In May 2013, we rated as True Abbott’s claim he’d sued President Barack Obama’s administration 25 times. ""He is so proud of that,"" Davis said. ""But what he doesn’t say is that our judges go to work; they rule against him and the people of this state win. In fact, he has lost four times in just the past few days. If he... were your lawyer,"" Davis said, ""you would fire him on the spot."" Four Abbott losses in a June jiffy? Davis's list of Abbott's ""losses"" By email, Davis spokesman Zac Petkanas pointed out news stories published over a week in June 2014 describing court actions while Abbott’s office separately responded that Davis failed to note key details. Let’s walk through how Davis backed up her statement before laying out Abbott’s objections. On June 16, 2014, according to a Dallas Morning News blog post, a state appeals court ruled a former Texas assistant attorney general, Ginger Weatherspoon, could proceed with her lawsuit charging she’d been fired for refusing to lie under oath about a judge. The story said: ""The AG’s office has spent years trying to get the suit tossed, claiming, among other things, that Weatherspoon didn’t make a ‘good faith’ effort to blow the whistle to the right links in the chain of command. A three-justice panel disagreed, and issued an opinion Monday written by Justice David Evans that said Dallas County Judge Martin Hoffman did the right thing last year when he refused to grant the AG’s office its request for summary judgment."" In the opinion, Evans said Weatherspoon reported suspected criminal violations to appropriate authorities inside the attorney general’s office. She ""has sufficiently alleged that she made good faith report of a violation of law by another public employee to an appropriate law enforcement authority,"" Evans wrote. According to a June 18, 2014, news story in the Austin American-Statesman, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ordered the state to pay almost $1.1 million in legal fees to lawyers who represented Davis and minority rights groups in a legal challenge to district boundaries drawn by the Republican-majority Legislature. The story said: ""U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer’s order criticized lawyers in"" Abbott’s ""office for submitting a legal brief that devoted more effort to complaining than it did to answering the legal issues in the fight over lawyer fees."" Collyer, an appointee of President George W. Bush, wrote: ""This matter presents a case study in how not to respond to a motion for attorney fees and costs."" Five days later, a state judge had spurned Abbott’s attempt to remove state District Judge John Dietz from presiding over the long-running public school finance case, the Statesman reported. Abbott, facing a likely legal defeat in the case as a whole, had argued emails showed the judge was biased in favor of school district lawyers seeking to have the state’s school-finance system declared unconstitutional, the story said. Visiting Judge David Peeples found Dietz had ""acted in good faith, holding out-of-court conversations with plaintiffs lawyers because ‘he believed that all parties had agreed to let such discussions take place,’"" the story said. The same day, the Texas Tribune summed up a U.S. Supreme Court ruling as the ""latest loss for Texas in its ongoing campaign against the federal government and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency."" The Tribune news story went on to say the court had ""largely dismissed"" Abbott’s ""challenge of federal climate rules. Seven justices agreed that the EPA is allowed to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from most large industrial facilities, like power plants and factories."" Based on the accounts offered by Davis, it looks like Abbott experienced an unappealable loss at the Supreme Court (the EPA case), the loss clearing the way for a former employee to have her day in court, plus two losses that could yet lead to appeals courts making win-or-loss rulings. Abbott's office objects Abbott's state spokesman, Jerry Strickland, said the turns were not so clear-cut. Besides, Strickland told us by email, Davis failed to note a criminal prosecution simultaneously completed by Abbott’s office. According to a Statesman news story posted online June 20, 2014, a Bastrop County jury sentenced a former teacher to 15 years in prison for sexually assaulting a student; the attorney general’s office handled the case after the Bastrop County district attorney’s office recused itself. Of course, Davis didn’t say Abbott had four losses uninterrupted. Strickland said of three of the results Davis was referencing: The decision enabling the former employee’s lawsuit to proceed was only procedural. ""Citing the decision as a loss when the case hasn’t even gone before a judge is like saying a team won the game because they won the pre-game coin flip,"" Strickland said. The D.C. judge who awarded attorney fees also issued a stay on the decision, pausing her order so the state could appeal. The decision not to order Dietz’s removal from the school funding lawsuit didn’t determine how the finance lawsuit itself will be judged on the state’s appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. ""No matter what happens on any day, in any motions in the school finance case, those decisions along the way are not the final word,"" Strickland said. Past those, Strickland said Abbott won the EPA case ""on the issues we argued."" Specifically, Strickland said, the high court overturned the EPA’s illegal greenhouse gas permitting scheme after determining that it ignored federal law, exceeded the authority granted the agency by Congress and violated the federal Clean Air Act. ""That was precisely what the state argued and thus, this was a win"" for Abbott, Strickland said. The court’s decision affirmed and reversed, in part, a lower court’s ruling in EPA’s favor. The justices basically said the EPA had exceeded its statutory authority when it interpreted the Clean Air Act to require certain kinds of permitting for industrial plants based on their greenhouse-gas emissions. On the other hand, the court concluded, the agency may continue to treat greenhouse gases as a pollutant subject to regulation under federal law. Expert analyst revisits EPA ruling For expert perspective, we asked Lyle Denniston, a reporter who analyzes Supreme Court decisions for the online Supreme Court of the United States blog, to speak to how Abbott and the state of Texas fared in the EPA case. Denniston said by email that states including Texas made arguments that paralleled those offered by lawyers for business firms--and those arguments prevailed. Specifically, he said, the states said EPA couldn’t bootstrap its regulation of greenhouse gases from motor vehicle exhausts into a broad regime of regulating greenhouse gases from industrial plants. Still, Denniston said, Texas fell short of a complete victory because the court didn’t agree the EPA has no authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and other stationary sources. Rather, he wrote, the court decided EPA could regulate greenhouse gases from sources already that were obliged, under law, to curb air pollution--meaning the agency could regulate 83 percent of greenhouse gas sources instead of the 86 percent that would have come under its regulatory sway if the administration’s broadest argument had stuck, Denniston said. Strickland, provided Denniston’s comments, cautioned against reading the high court’s ruling too narrowly. The case, Strickland emailed, ""was about separation of powers, and the limits of EPA's authority. The court rebuked what they saw as a federal government that tried to rewrite the rules and laws, without legislative approval. This is a victory"" for Abbott. Our ruling Davis said Abbott ""has lost"" in court ""four times in just the past few days."" Abbott sustained four legal setbacks, we conclude, but the Democrat's statement needs clarification. Three rulings could prove to be bumps along the road o’ litigation possibly culminating in Abbott wins. And in the EPA case, the justices partly agreed with Texas, though they upheld federal regulation of greenhouse gases as pollutants. Notably, too, just one of the referenced rulings involved the Obama administration. We rate this claim as Mostly True.

Wisconsin unemployment rarely above U.S. when Mary Burke was commerce chief, her spokesman says
","In February 2014, ramping up efforts to tie Democratic gubernatorial front-runner Mary Burke to former Gov. Jim Doyle, the Wisconsin Republican Party declared: ""The only time over the last 25 years when the state’s unemployment rate exceeded the U.S. average was when Burke was commerce secretary."" We rated the claim Mostly True. Dating back to 1988, there were 15 months when Wisconsin’s unemployment rate was higher, all during Burke’s time running Commerce under Doyle. The GOP’s claim only indirectly blamed Burke and we noted that other factors, such as trends in the U.S. economy, affect state unemployment rates. In an interview on June 23, 2014, however, Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki said the state unemployment rate exceeded the national rate for only three months while Burke ran Commerce. So, let’s reboot. Reviewing the rates During Zepecki’s interview on ""The Devil’s Advocates,"" a talk show on WXXM-FM (92.1) in Madison, the two co-hosts and Zepecki talked about Burke and Gov. Scott Walker in terms of job creation and unemployment. Here’s a portion of the exchange: Co-host Mike Crute: ""Well, back when Mary Burke was the commerce secretary, I believe 2006-2007, Joe, the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent. Of course, they (Republicans) want to say, 'higher than the national average,' for the short time Mary was in that position. But at 4.7 percent, I mean, that is pretty much full employment when she was commerce secretary."" (Burke actually was commerce secretary from February 2005 to November 2007.) Zepecki: ""It is, and it was three months, three individual months within her two and a half years where I believe the unemployment rate here was about a tenth of a percentage point higher. Again, this is what they’re doing, just trying to play fast and loose and lay out ways to obscure (Walker’s) failures on jobs."" When we contacted Zepecki, he began his email response by saying: ""I got this one wrong."" Zepecki said he made his claim based on his recollection of a chart produced by the state GOP that compared Wisconsin and U.S. unemployment rates during Burke’s time at Commerce. He said the chart seemed to show three periods of time when Wisconsin’s rate exceeded the U.S. rate. But he didn’t disagree, as we found in fact-checking the GOP’s claim, that U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show Wisconsin’s rate was higher for 15 months of Burke’s 33-month tenure. It’s worth noting that, even when Wisconsin’s rate exceeded the national rate, it was by less than one-half of 1 percentage point. Our rating Zepecki said the Wisconsin unemployment rate was higher than the U.S. rate during only three months when Mary Burke was state commerce secretary. Wisconsin’s rate was never more than fourth-tenths of a percentage point higher than the U.S. rate, but it did exceed the U.S. rate for nearly half of of Burke’s 33 months running Commerce.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse says there are more U.S. jobs in solar industry than coal mining
","For more than a year, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse has delivered weekly Senate speeches about the dangers of climate change. He frequently denounces climate-change deniers, and urges growth of green jobs and technologies to reduce America’s reliance on foreign fossil fuel. In a May 27, 2014 commentary in The Providence Journal, Whitehouse argued for a nationwide price on carbon pollution. And he expressed hope for a prosperous, clean-energy future and faith that ""there is more economic security in our own American know-how than in corrupt foreign fossil fuel countries."" To that end, Whitehouse noted that there ""are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining."" This claim is reminiscent of his November 2012 statement that ""we have more people working in clean and green energy than in oil and gas in this country."" (PolitiFact Rhode Island ruled that claim as True.) The solar industry has seen tremendous growth.  But have solar industry jobs actually eclipsed the number of coal-mining jobs? Whitehouse communications director Seth Larson cited two sources to back up the senator’s claim. The first is a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report issued in May 2013 that counts an estimated 80,030 jobs for all occupations within the coal-mining  industry -- a sector of the coal industry as a whole. For solar jobs, Larson cited The Solar Foundation’s ""National Solar Jobs Census 2013,"" which states that the solar industry ""employs 142,698 Americans as of November 2013."" First, let’s look at coal-mining jobs. We checked with the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that Whitehouse had quoted the May 2013 number correctly. (The more recent April 2014 BLS month survey counted  78,500 coal-mining jobs. Neither of those include self-employed contractors.) BLS press officer Gary Steinberg said its estimated numbers are drawn from ""an annual survey of employers, by occupation,"" based on data sent by businesses. They reflect jobs, not people. We also found three other sets of coal-mining numbers. Spoiler alert: they are not all apples-to-apples. They use different methodologies and different definitions. But they provide an overall picture. A 2013 report from the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration cited 123,227 jobs -- substantially more than the BLS, but still less than the number of solar jobs Whitehouse cited. MHSA surveys the mines themselves as opposed to the companies, and therefore includes contractors as well as regular workers.    SNL Energy, a leading energy data provider, analyzes MSHA data to capture ""snapshot"" industry trends. Its June 2014 report, ""U.S. coal miner employment sustains free fall beyond 2nd year,"" cites an 8.3% drop in  the one-year period ending March 31, to 79,658 employees. That excludes contractors and 33 not-yet-reported mines.   By contrast, the National Mining Association, a trade group, counted 195,494 coal-mining jobs in 2012. The breakdown: miners (including contractors): 137,650; support activities: 6,930; transportation: 50,914. That’s nearly 53,000 more than Whitehouse’s solar jobs number. Spokeswoman Nancy Gravatt said the NMA maintains that the additional support services ""should be included because all of these activities are integral to the daily work in the mines."" But the NMA’s definition of coal-mining jobs goes far beyond those used by the federal agencies, including such transportation workers as railroad engineers and seamen on coal freighters. In other words, data from three sources supports Whitehouse’s claim. The NMA count does not. Now let’s check out the solar data. Larson cited The Solar Foundation’s ""National Solar Jobs Census 2013,"" which states that the solar industry ""employs 142,698 Americans as of November 2013."" The Solar Foundation is an independent, national 501(c)(3) nonprofit, non-lobbying group, that strives ""to increase the widespread adoption of solar energy through educational outreach, policy research, and market transformation."" Their data is considered ""the most authoritative"" by the Congressional Research Service. Its report defines ""solar workers"" as those who spend ""at least 50 percent of their time supporting solar-related activities."" According to its 2013 census, ""approximately 91 percent of those who meet our definition of a solar worker spent 100 percent of their time working on solar."" Andrea Luecke, the foundation’s executive director, said the foundation surveys the ""known universe"" of self-identified solar companies, of which there are about 6,000 nationwide. ""We go out directly to those companies. This year, we made 74,000 phone calls and sent 11,000 emails,"" over the course of one month. The foundation also surveys companies ""that help supply the ‘known universe’ with raw materials,"" Luecke said. ""It’s a census approach, so we’re doing a direct count and extrapolate to get national numbers, which is how the BLS does it."" Luecke said by the census report’s measure, ""the solar industry is outpacing coal mining."" But she noted, ""You have to understand that coal-mining is one aspect of the coal industry - whereas we’re talking about the whole solar industry."" If you add in other coal industry categories, ""it’s more than solar, for sure. But the coal-mining bucket is less, for sure."" Our ruling: Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said that solar industry jobs have now outpaced coal-mining jobs. The most recent data from three objective sources support his claim. The one source that offered a contrary view, the National Mining Association, cited two-year-old numbers and counted categories such as off-site transportation workers on coal barges and ocean freighters. Because Whitehouse’s statement was specifically about coal-mining jobs, we rule it True.

"['Voting Record', 'Virginia', 'Ed  Gillespie']","
Gillespie says Warner supports Majority Leader Reid ""down the line""
","Republican Senate candidate Ed Gillespie is continuing to attack incumbent Mark Warner as a loyal lieutenant to liberal leaders in Washington. ""I would not support the president’s policies down the line and Harry Reid down the line, as Mark Warner has,"" Gillespie said during a recent interview on Fox News. Gillespie and the state GOP repeatedly have said Warner has voted with President Barack Obama 97 percent of the time. We rated that claim True this spring, but noted that Obama has taken a position on only 28 percent of the measures Warner has voted on. Warner’s key show of solidarity with the president was his 2010 vote to pass Obamacare. With that work behind us, we decided to probe the unexplored part of Gillespie’s claim: That Warner has supported Senate Majority Harry Reid, D-Nev., ""down the line."" Gillespie’s campaign declined to back up or explain the statement. So we went to the voting records. OpenCongress.org has a tool that compares the voting record of U.S. senators and representatives for the current two-year term of Congress, which started in January 2013.  Warner voted the same way as Reid 87 percent of the time through June 24 of this year. That ties as the ninth lowest percentage among 51 Senate Democrats. The lowest correlation is owned by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., at 79 percent; the highest is 93 percent, shared by five senators. The average among all Democratic senators, excluding Reid, is 91 percent. Next, we compiled a record of the roll call votes for the previous four years in which Reid and Warner were both in the Senate. In both the 111th and 112th Congress terms, they also voted the same way 87 percent of the time.   Warner and Reid have agreed on these major bills: Warner has opposed Reid on several key bills by voting: Many of Warner’s voting disagreements with Reid occurred not in the final actions on bills, but in earlier votes on proposed amendments to them. Warner has supported a number of cost-cutting amendments that Reid has opposed. This includes Warner’s votes: Warner campaigned for office in 2008 as a ""radical centrist"" who would seek bipartisan compromise. David Turner, Warner’s campaign spokesman this year, said Gillespie’s efforts to define the senator by vote comparisons ""is distorting Senator Warner’s moderate record."" Turner sent us links to other vote studies and news articles that praise Warner for his bipartisan work. For example, the National Journal rated Warner the 46th most liberal member of the 100-seat U.S. Senate in 2013, based on an analysis of 117 roll call votes on key economic, foreign and social issues. And Open Congress, found that Warner voted with the majority of his party on 90 percent of all Senate bills last year, ranking him 42nd among the 51 Democratic senators. Turner also noted that Warner and Reid disagreed on some matters that the Senate never voted on. Warner, for example, drew national attention for leading an informal, bipartisan group of six senators seeking tax and spending compromises that would lower the national debt. Reid dismissed the effort as ""happy talk."" He left Warner off a bipartisan supercommitee that unsuccessfully searched for fiscal compromises to avoid automatic spending cuts -- also known as sequestration -- that went into effect last year. Turner also sent us a recent Politico article that named Warner as one of a group of Democratic senators who has been pushing Reid to ease his control of the Senate by allowing more votes on bills and opening up the amendment process. Our ruling Gillespie accused Warner of supporting Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ""down the line."" Gillespie’s campaign declined to provide any explanation of the statement. Records show that Warner and Reid have voted in accord 87 percent of the time, including on most of the landmark bills since 2009. That shows substantial agreement, but not the knee-jerk support for Reid that Gillespie suggests. Among the 51 Senate Democrats, Warner has the ninth lowest voting percentage with Reid. Reid and Warner usually agree, but they’re not clones. We rate Gillespie’s exaggerated statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D34240>],/factchecks/2014/jul/06/ed-gillespie/gillespie-says-warner-supports-majority-leader-rei/
"['Abortion', 'National', 'Health Care', 'Legal Issues', 'Women', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Hillary Clinton says a Hobby Lobby salesclerk 'is not going to get' contraception
","By now, lots of major political figures have weighed in on the decision in Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby, a landmark Supreme Court case. A 5-4 majority ruled that a closely held, private corporation, such as the craft retailer Hobby Lobby, could decline on religious grounds to pay for certain kinds of contraceptives otherwise mandated in employee health coverage by the Affordable Care Act. One of the most closely watched responses was by Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State who is the presumptive frontrunner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. Clinton addressed the case during a question-and-answer session at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado. Clinton blasted the decision as ""deeply disturbing."" ""It’s very troubling that a salesclerk at Hobby Lobby who needs contraception, which is pretty expensive, is not going to get that service through her employer’s health care plan because her employer doesn’t think she should be using contraception,"" Clinton said. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker reviewed this claim and gave it Two Pinocchios, out of a maximum of four. We thought we’d take our own look. First, some background. The company’s owners say they object to four out of the 20 Food and Drug Administration-approved forms of contraception -- the four that prevent implantation of the embryo. These include two forms of ""emergency contraception,"" sometimes called the ""morning-after pill,"" and two forms of intra-uterine devices, or IUDs. (Officially, the FDA considers these four methods to be ""contraception,"" but the company’s Christian owners consider them to be a form of abortion.) According to the Wall Street Journal, the company actually supported all 20 forms of contraception until 2012, when the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty informed Hobby Lobby about the Affordable Care Act’s contraception requirement. Owner David Green told the Journal that he was ""shocked"" at the discovery. He proceeded to revoke the coverage and file the suit that was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court on June 30, 2014. Contrary to Clinton’s claim, Hobby Lobby’s website says the company does in fact support the other 16 forms of contraception. Here are some excerpts from its Frequently Asked Questions page: Q: Is Hobby Lobby preventing its employees from buying contraceptives under its plan? A: Not at all. The Greens (the family that owns the company) and their family businesses respect the individual liberties of all their employees. The Greens and their family businesses have no objection to the other 16 FDA-approved contraceptives required by the law that do not interfere with the implantation of a fertilized egg. They provide coverage for such contraceptives under their health care plan. Additionally, the four objectionable drugs and devices are widely available and affordable, and employees are free to obtain them. Q: But isn’t Hobby Lobby depriving its women employees of health care? A: Just the opposite: the Greens and their family businesses, including Hobby Lobby Stores Inc., offer their employees – nearly 70 percent of whom are women – a robust benefit plan that includes coverage for preventive care and almost all of the contraceptives required under the Affordable Care Act. That plan includes an on-site clinic with no co-pay at Hobby Lobby headquarters, and all full-time employees are eligible to enroll in a generous benefit plan: including medical, dental, prescription drugs, along with long-term disability and life insurance, and a 401(k) plan with a generous company match. For the record, the 16 contraceptives the company supports, according to a Hobby Lobby spokeswoman, are: male condoms; female condoms; diaphragms with spermicide; sponges with spermicide; cervical caps with spermicide; spermicide alone; birth-control pills with estrogen and progestin; birth-control pills with progestin alone; birth control pills, extended or continuous use; contraceptive patches; contraceptive rings; progestin injections; implantable rods; vasectomies; female sterilization surgeries; female sterilization implants. Of course, not all of these forms will be equally useful to the salesclerk, particularly vasectomies and male condoms. Still, they include some of the most widely used forms of contraception, including several varieties of the birth-control pill. We found no evidence to dispute the company’s assertion that it pays for 16 out of 20 forms of contraception. So Clinton goes too far when she says the salesclerk ""is not going to get"" contraception through the company’s health care plan. And the fact that the company pays for 16 types undercuts Clinton’s claim that Hobby Lobby ""doesn’t think she should be using contraception."" Where Clinton’s claim includes a grain of truth is that the salesclerk will not have an unfettered choice in what form of contraception she gets. Say the salesclerk is unable, for medical reasons, to use the birth control pill. An IUD might be a good alternative, but it would not be available to her under Hobby Lobby’s health care plan. IUD use has been increasing in recent years, and paying for one out-of-pocket means significant up-front expenses. If IUD implantation is taken off the table, the salesclerk may be forced to choose another method -- one that may be less well-suited to the employee. There’s another nuance that leave this question in something of a gray area. The way the decision was written leaves some question about whether closely held, religious companies can choose to opt out of supporting any of the remaining 16 forms of contraception in their health plans. For the record, a spokeswoman said that Hobby Lobby ""will continue to cover all 16,"" but that may not be the case for other companies. Already, some companies have been allowed by lower courts to stop paying for a wider range of contraceptives than were at issue in the Hobby Lobby case, according to the Associated Press. Their cases are likely to work their way through the courts, and the Supreme Court has let those policies stand pending further appeals. While the Hobby Lobby decision may open the door to judicial acceptance of more sweeping contraceptive bans, the specific comment we’re checking targeted Hobby Lobby -- and it’s significantly flawed. ""To the extent she was talking about Hobby Lobby as an employer specifically, I think Clinton overstated her case,"" said I. Glenn Cohen, co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology & Bioethics at Havard Law School. He added, ""It may be true for a subset of employees, and to the extent she was also referring to other potential employers who might ban all contraceptives, I think she is on firmer ground."" Our ruling Clinton said that ""a salesclerk at Hobby Lobby who needs contraception … is not going to get that service through her employer’s health care plan because her employer doesn’t think she should be using contraception."" There’s reason to believe that future court decisions could allow companies to forgo payment for all types of birth control, but Clinton’s claim refers specifically to Hobby Lobby’s policies toward its employees. And in that context, her claim is greatly exaggerated. Hobby Lobby doesn’t shun contraception entirely for its employees; it pays for access to 16 out of the FDA’s 20 approved methods. Where Clinton has a partial point is that an employee would be barred from having the company pay for four other types, even if one of those may be the best medical option for the employee’s needs. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False. UPDATE, July 4, 2014: After this article was published, Hillary Clinton's camp got back to us. A spokesman pointed us to a line from Ginsberg's dissent that ""seems to be pretty in line with"" Clinton's comments. ""The exemption sought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga (Wood Specialties, another plaintiff in the case) would override significant interests of the corporations’ employees and covered dependents. It would deny legions of women who do not hold their employers’ beliefs access to contraceptive coverage that the ACA would otherwise secure."" We stand by the rating of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C477E40>],/factchecks/2014/jul/03/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-hobby-lobby-salesclerk-not-go/
"['Elections', 'North Carolina', 'Robert Pittenger']","
Pittenger misleads about his opponent's support for Trump
","If Rep. Robert Pittenger has his way, the primary election for his seat will become a contest over loyalty to President Donald Trump. Pittenger, a Republican from the Charlotte area, faces an opponent in Rev. Mark Harris, who came within 134 votes of beating him for the District 9 seat in June 2016. The winner of the GOP primary faces the winner of the Democratic primary between Christian Cano and Dan McCready, as well as Libertarian Jeff Scott. Harris has attempted to position himself to the right of Pittenger. So Pittenger recently released an ad that casts Harris as a critic of Trump, who carried the district with 54 percent of the vote in 2016. In the ad, a newspaper headline appears on screen and reads, ""Mark Harris worked to stop a Trump presidency."" The ad’s narrator says, ""Mark Harris worked to stop Trump from being president."" In a news release accompanying the ad, Pittenger strategist Paul Shumaker said Harris ""led the ‘Stop Trump’ campaign"" before the GOP convention. Harris, for his part, told The Charlotte Observer that there’s ""no record whatsoever that I was part of a Stop Trump movement."" PolitiFact reached out to the Pittenger campaign about the claim. The campaign directed us to a WBT Radio clip from March 10, 2016, in which Harris talks about his support of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. A radio interview ""He’s gonna be the next president of the United States,"" Harris said of Cruz during the interview. ""It does seem that Donald Trump does have somewhat of a ceiling,"" Harris said. ""And in these close primaries, he loses most of the time. So I think that’s an interesting aspect. So I think coalescing behind Ted Cruz is a way to stop Donald Trump and go into the convention, get our nominee and come out and beat Hillary Clinton in the fall. The radio host then asks Harris if he’d support Trump if Trump were to become the Republican nominee. ""That’s an interesting question,"" Harris responds. ""I think everyone is weighing that out and considering that."" ""To be honest, it’s a very concerning decision that will have to be made because we’re looking at one entire generation of Supreme Court justices being nominated that will affect us and I’m truly concerned most of all of Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders having that ability to choose,"" Harris continued. ""I feel somewhat better about Donald Trump making those appointments but I can’t tell you I feel great about that by any stretch of the imagination."" Lawrence Shaheen, a spokesman for Pittenger, provided a link to a story in the Independent in April 2016 that reported Harris campaigning for Cruz. He also pointed to Harris’ Facebook and Twitter accounts to argue that Harris was never enthusiastic about Trump. Those accounts show very few pro-Trump tweets until Trump won the presidency. Supporting Cruz at the primary PolitiFact contacted the Harris campaign about the radio clip. Spokesman Andy Yates acknowledged in an email that Harris had concerns about Trump prior to his nomination. But, Yates added, so did ""the 60 percent of NC primary voters who voted for someone other than Donald Trump for president in the March primary, including Congressman Pittenger who was still supporting outspoken Trump opponent Marco Rubio."" The North Carolina primaries took place on March 15, 2016. That’s when Trump won a plurality of the votes, with 40 percent, and Cruz was the runner-up with 36 percent. Yates provided a link to Pittenger’s Feb. 3 endorsement of Rubio and defended the ""stop Trump"" comment, pointing out that the radio interview took place four months prior to the Republican National Convention. ""Dr. Harris was fully supporting President Trump well before the convention and never engaged in any efforts to try to stop President Trump from receiving the nomination he had won,"" Yates said. The Baptist Press reported in July that Harris was slated to attend the Republican National Convention as a Cruz delegate, but had to withdraw ""to be with a ‘father in the ministry’ who has entered hospice care."" When did his support shift? So, about four months before the Republican National Convention in Ohio, Harris said ""coalescing behind Ted Cruz"" was the best way to ""stop Trump"" and beat Democratic nominee Clinton. Does that mean Harris ""worked"" to stop Trump from being president? Certainly, campaigning for another candidate can be considered ""working against"" another. So how long did it take for Harris to support Trump? Harris ""switched his support to Trump when it became clear to him that Trump had secured the delegates necessary to win the Republican nomination,"" Yates said. ""Mark said that if he remembered correctly it was around the time of the California primary."" The California primary in 2016 was held on June 7. By June 27 of that year, The Charlotte Observer wrote a story casting Harris as a defender of Trump’s. ""There’s more than just a four-year term for a president at stake,"" Harris said, referring to Trump’s critics. ""I think there’s a 40-year generation at stake. Decisions will be made by the next president that will affect us for 40 years."" Pittenger, for his part, shifted his support to Trump that May. Shaheen forwarded an email that Pittenger sent to the Charlotte Observer on May 4. Pittenger was then quoted as supporting Trump in the Charlotte Agenda later that month. By the time November rolled around, the Daily Beast wrote a story that referred to Harris as ""part of Trump’s North Carolina spiritual advisory group."" Yates said Harris ultimately traveled to six states to support Trump and that he endorsed Trump from the pulpit at Charlotte First Baptist, where he was a pastor. He sent a clip of Harris speaking at a Trump rally. The video didn’t give a date for the rally but was published on Jan. 28, 2017. Our ruling Pittenger said, ""Mark Harris worked to stop Trump from being president."" He has a point that Harris supported Ted Cruz for president until Trump became the nominee. But he left out the important context that Pittenger also supported another candidate. It’s disingenuous to cast Harris as someone who tried to sabotage Trump without providing context that Harris not only supported Trump after he became the nominee, but was reported to be among his spiritual advisors. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097911B80>],/factchecks/2018/mar/16/robert-pittenger/pittenger-misleads-about-his-opponents-support-tru/
"['National', 'Congress', 'Donald Trump']","
Why Trump appointments have lagged behind other presidents
","President Donald Trump has long blamed Democrats for moving his nominees through the Senate confirmation process at a sluggish pace. ""Hundreds of good people, including very important ambassadors and judges, are being blocked and/or slow walked by the Democrats in the Senate,"" Trump tweeted March 14. ""Many important positions in government are unfilled because of this obstruction.""  Hundreds of good people, including very important Ambassadors and Judges, are being blocked and/or slow walked by the Democrats in the Senate. Many important positions in Government are unfilled because of this obstruction. Worst in U.S. history! We ran the numbers, and Trump is certainly right on one count: Important government posts are empty. But allocating blame is more complicated than Trump suggests. Democrats bear some responsibility, but so do Senate Republicans and the Trump White House. Compared with recent presidents, Trump has had the fewest nominees confirmed to date, according to the White House. Trump has also had the smallest percent of nominees confirmed by the Senate at this point in his presidency, relative to recent predecessors. Only 57 percent of Trump’s nominees have been confirmed, below that of Presidents Barack Obama (67 percent), George W. Bush (78 percent), Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush (each with 81 percent).  The Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that tracks political appointees, also found that Trump has seen fewer confirmations than recent presidents at this point. At an average rate of 81 days per confirmation, Trump’s nominees have also experienced significantly more lag time than those appointed by recent presidents. Of the roughly 1,200 positions that require Senate confirmation, the Partnership for Public Service has identified 640 ""key positions"" (excluding judicial and military appointments). Its latest data shows 144 key Trump nominees currently await Senate confirmation. So key government positions are unfilled. But who deserves the blame? Historically, senators routinely confirmed lower-level presidential nominees without much fanfare. But more recently, the Senate confirmation process has become a partisan battleground. In 2013, the Democratic-controlled Senate passed a measure to weaken Republicans’ ability to filibuster Obama’s nominees. Republicans responded with procedural combat. Now Democrats have answered in kind, putting even non-controversial nominees through the procedural gamut. Under the 2013 rule change, the number of votes required to break a filibuster of presidential nominees — through a process called cloture — was lowered from 60 to a simple majority of 51. But minority parties adopted new tactics. For instance, once the majority party breaks a filibuster through cloture, the minority party is allowed 30 additional hours of post-cloture debate — a procedural maneuver Democrats can use to drain the clock and bog down the confirmation process. ""Floor time is the most precious commodity in the Senate and majority leaders are loath to lose time on nominations unless they are critical,"" said Ian Ostrander, a political science professor at Michigan State University. ""The majority party must now triage its nominations by prioritizing which ones are worth spending the time on."" According to the White House, Democrats have forced 78 cloture votes on Trump’s nominees. But experts stressed that not all Democratic obstruction should be viewed as simple partisan warfare. Legitimate concerns have surrounded some Trump nominees’ qualifications. They also noted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., could keep the Senate in session for more hours in order to mitigate the Democrats’ use of the cloture process. Another procedural hurdle facing Trump nominees is the Senate ""hold."" The Senate generally operates on the principle of unanimous consent, so a single senator may seek to hold up an executive nominee by withholding consent. Ultimately, the decision to honor a hold request is up to the majority leader. Senate leaders typically grant these requests because to deny a hold creates alternative avenues for the senator to expend scarce floor time, according to the Congressional Research Service. Not surprisingly, Democrats have made use of this tactic. But Republican senators have also issued a significant number of holds as a way to extract concessions on various policy issues. (It’s difficult to make a systematic tally of which party is behind these delays because senators are not always required to publicly disclose holds.) One analysis found that of the eight published objections in 2017, four came from Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa. More intraparty holds have been placed in recent months, Politico reported in February, with at least 11 Republican senators publicly blocking nominees for the Energy, State and Justice departments, among other agencies. David Lewis, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University, pointed to the example of Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who has held up Justice Department nominees over differences with the Trump administration on marijuana policy. ""It is certainly true that Democrats have used their institutional prerogatives to slow things down,"" Lewis said. ""That said, Republicans have as well."" Ultimately, Trump shares the blame for the slimmed down federal workforce, experts said. As a starting point, it’s fair to ask how committed Trump is to staffing the government. The Partnership for Public Service, which tracks political appointees, notes that more than 200 key positions don’t even have nominees. Trump himself has suggested an understaffed bureaucracy might be more of a feature rather than a defect of his administration. He told Forbes in an October 2017 interview: ""I'm generally not going to make a lot of the appointments that would normally be — because you don't need them,"" he says. ""I mean, you look at some of these agencies, how massive they are, and it's totally unnecessary. They have hundreds of thousands of people."" Burdett Loomis, a political science professor at the University of Kansas, said whether Trump wants to fill out his ranks is a central question. ""Trump doesn't necessarily believe in government, hence less pressure to fill slots,"" Loomis said. Yet even Trump’s good faith efforts to make executive appointments have been poorly managed, experts said. ""He was slow out of the gate, and his vetting was poor due to poor planning and a poorly run Office of Presidential Personnel,"" Lewis said. ""The president’s missteps early meant that he was always going to play catch up."" Trump did nothing to smooth the process by alienating Democrats early on, Ostrander said. ""One of Trump’s first acts as president was to ignore Democratic Party input and push through several controversial cabinet nominees as well as (Neil) Gorsuch for the Supreme Court,"" Ostrander said. ""While President Trump broke no rules in doing so, these actions made Democrats in the Senate far less interested in working with the administration on future nominations."" Experts noted that some of the delay is the result of legitimate concerns about Trump nominee qualifications and conflicts of interest, which has led to heightened scrutiny. ""If the president were nominating persons with impeccable credentials, no conflicts of interest, and broad support, there would be not concerns about delays,"" Lewis said. ""Instead, the president is choosing non-traditional nominees with complex financial holdings and often less expertise than they need."" While Trump generally earned poor marks for his approach to bureaucratic nominations, his staffing of federal courts tells another story entirely. In this area, Trump has been energetic. Trump appointed more circuit court judges in his first year than any president in history, and ranked sixth overall in first-year federal judge appointments (trial court, appeals court and Supreme Court combined). Experts attributed this to better coordination between the White House and Senate on judges than executive appointments. Some suggested Republicans have simply made judicial appointments a higher priority. ""I believe that Trump and his allies in the Senate have made the (correct) calculation that judicial nominations are simply worth more in the long run,"" Ostrander said. Trump said Democratic obstruction is the reason why ""many important positions in government are unfilled."" There’s a lot of blame to go around for the federal government’s relatively modest headcount. Senate Democrats, adopting the upper chamber’s new norms, have engaged in procedural combat. Yet Senate Republicans have also held up Trump’s nominees to extract concessions. Finally, the Trump White House earns generally low marks for its approach to executive appointments. We rate this Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3FE800>],/factchecks/2018/mar/16/donald-trump/why-trump-appointments-have-lagged-behind-other-pr/

Half of female homicides in the U.S. involve an intimate partner
","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo wants state lawmakers to pass a bill he believes would prevent more women from being murdered by people close to them. The bill would remove guns from people convicted on misdemeanor domestic violence charges. Guns are currently only taken away if someone has a felony conviction for domestic violence. ""Half of the American women who are murdered are killed by their intimate partners,"" Cuomo said at a March 13 rally. The bill is part of Cuomo’s 2018 Women’s Agenda, a list of more than two dozen proposals concerning healthcare, equal pay and gun violence among other issues. The domestic violence bill doubles as one of the governor’s proposals to add to the state’s gun control laws. New York state already has one of the lowest rates of gun-caused death in the country, but Cuomo believes the proposal could drive that number lower. Is he right that half of women murdered in the U.S. are killed by their intimate partners? The data Cuomo’s claim comes from data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2017. The agency looked at the homicides of 10,018 adult women in 18 states from 2003 to 2014. The circumstances of the homicide were known in 8,028 of the cases. Of those, 4,442 homicides, or 55.3 percent, were related to intimate partner violence. The report defines an intimate partner as a current, former, or unspecified spouse or romantic partner. Women killed while intervening in an incident of intimate partner violence, like a friend or family member, were also counted in this category. Almost 80 percent of intimate partner homicides involved a current intimate partner.  About 11 percent of victims had experienced violence in the month preceding their death. An argument preceded the victim’s death in about a third of intimate partner homicides, the report found. Gun-involved homicides The report does not include data on the criminal history of the suspects. It’s not known what share had a history of domestic violence. But the agency did collect information on the type of weapon used in each homicide. A firearm was used in 5,234 of the total homicides, or almost 54 percent. That’s more than double the number of victims killed with a sharp instrument, the next most-documented weapon. The authors of the report suggest legislation like Cuomo’s could help prevent more female homicides in the future. ""State statutes limiting access to firearms for persons under a domestic violence restraining order can serve as another preventive measure associated with reduced risk for intimate partner homicide and firearm intimate partner homicide,"" the report said. A report from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics found an estimated 45 percent of female homicide victims were killed by an intimate partner in 2007. New York state data Numbers in New York state mirror national data. About 48 percent of female domestic homicides in New York state involved an intimate partner in 2016, according to a report from the state Division of Criminal Justice Services. A firearm was used in about a third of all domestic homicides in New York state. The state data does not include homicides where there was no known relationship between the suspect and victim. Our ruling Cuomo said ""Half of the American women who are murdered are killed by their intimate partners."" Data collected by the CDC supports Cuomo’s claim. More than half of the female homicides the agency studied involved an intimate partner when the relationship was known.

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Similar hoaxes about Soros and Putin have circulated since November 2016. Soros is a hedge fund manager who has supported liberal causes and backed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. He has been the target of many online hoaxes, including that President Donald Trump declared Soros a ""national security threat"". Viral Politics US stated that Russia declared Soros and his organizations a ""threat to Russian national security."" That phrase is similar to the language used by Russian officials when they banned two Soros charities in 2015. ""It was found that the activity of the Open Society Foundations and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation represents a threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state,"" stated a translated version of a press statement by Russia's General Prosecutor's Office in November 2015. The Viral Politics US story pulls actual quotes from a 2010 Rolling Stone article about Goldman Sachs including this quote: ""The world’s most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money."" Although the Rolling Stone article makes no mention of Soros, the Viral Politics US story tries to create a connection by stating ""obviously Soros wants to be like Goldman Sachs."" Viral Politics US then tosses in a quote by a man named Phil Butler: ""George Soros has a finger in every political pie there is. If there is a crisis on our world, it’s a safe bet he’s had a hand in it,’"" Viral Politics US wrote. The online hoax provides no explanation about the identity of Butler, but we found the quote by Butler in an article for the online magazine New Eastern Outlook in July 2016. Butler described Soros as a ""real arch villain"" and accused Soros of manipulating the 2016 presidential election. Butler describes himself as an analyst and expert on Eastern Europe. While there is no evidence that Putin sought a warrant to arrest Soros, the billionaire has been a major critic of the Russian president and said he believes that Putin has been behind the attacks on him. In January while speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Soros said, ""Open societies are in crisis, and various forms of dictatorships and mafia states, exemplified by Putin’s Russia, are on the rise."" In October 2016, Soros criticized Putin for Russia's bombing campaign in Syria calling on him to ""put an end to his heinous crimes against humanity."" Viral Politics US wrote that ""Putin issues international arrest warrant for Soros."" While Russia banned two Soros charities in 2015, we found no evidence that Putin issued a warrant for the billionaire’s arrest.

Do 1 percent of gun sellers supply more than half of all the guns used in crimes?
","As tens of thousands of students across the country walked out of their schools to protest gun violence, members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee examined school safety procedures and gun policies ahead of the Parkland school shooting.   During the hearing, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., repeated a talking point among people who support gun restrictions and expressed the need to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. He said most guns used in crime come from only a handful of places. ""We see guns pouring into our community, and we have found that a significant number of them are coming from a very small group of retailers that sell to criminals or straw purchasers,"" Booker said March 14, a month after the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.   He turned to Thomas Brandon, acting director of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives: ""You’re aware of that, correct?"" Brandon said yes, but Booker took the claim a step further: ""We know the research shows that 1 percent of licensed dealers supply a whopping 57 percent of the guns that are recovered in crimes."" Brandon said Booker’s claim rested on outdated research. ""Yes, senator. That’s a study that, I think, is over 20 years old,"" Brandon said. ""I would not agree with that statistic today."" Booker continued to press Brandon about the distribution between licensed gun dealers and guns recovered in crimes and then talked about the need for more research on gun violence. Still, the differing assertions made us wonder about Booker’s statistic. As we’ve found in the past, a federal report from 2000 backs this up. But there are several caveats worth pointing out. Booker's point matches data from a 2000 report from the federal Bureau of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Department. The report found that 1.2 percent of licensed gun dealers accounted for more than 57 percent of the crime guns traced to current dealers in 1998. The study looked at the number of licensed retail dealers and pawnbrokers nationwide and aimed to track the movement of a firearm recovered by law enforcement officials from its first sale by the manufacturer. An ATF spokesman said the agency no longer uses that study to evaluate current crime trends. Frank Kelsey, chief of the public affairs division at ATF, said tracing a gun used in a crime back to a dealer does not necessarily indicate illegal activity by the dealer or its employees. And he noted that a gun might have changed hands any number of times — legally or illegally — before it was used in a crime. That said, there isn’t any more up-to-date information on the subject — and there’s a reason for that. In 2003, Congress and the George W. Bush administration, with the support of the National Rifle Association, passed the Tiahrt Amendment, which forbids ATF from sharing information about guns it has traced with the public except with state and local police agencies in the course of a criminal investigation. Two of the experts we reached out to (Daniel Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, and Jaclyn Schildkraut, assistant professor of Public Justice, State University of New York at Oswego) said that they wouldn’t completely dismiss the findings of the 2000 report, unless there was any evidence that showed otherwise. Still, more information is needed. Glenn L. Pierce, the director of the Institute of Security and Public Policy at Northeastern University, helped compile the ATF’s 2000 analysis. Pierce said the pattern found in 1998, when there were 105,563 federal firearms licensees, is very similar to the pattern identified in the 1995/1996 first report to ATF, at which time there were about 258,000 federal firearms licensees. ""At least over those years, the pattern stayed very much the same even (as) the number of (federal firearms licensees) showed a steep decline due to legislation implemented in 1994 during the Clinton administration,"" he said. Still, he said, it would be necessary for ATF to conduct another study to determine the extent to which this is actually the case today. ""The firearms trace patterns found in the 1995 and 2000 reports might well persist today, but it would be necessary for ATF to conduct such a trace data analysis to determine the extent to which this actually the case."" Booker said, ""Research shows that 1 percent of license dealers supply a whopping 57 percent of the guns that are recovered in crimes. Booker made his claim in the present tense, but the data that backs his point is almost 20 years old. We do not have better data to represent the current picture. The 2000 report traced the purchases of guns used in crimes back to the original dealer. But it didn’t take into account whether the firearm changed hands, illegally or legally, before it was used in a crime. That said, Booker is relying on the latest, best data available. Booker’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information about the study's age. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3DB200>],/factchecks/2018/mar/16/cory-booker/are-1-percent-gun-retailers-responsible-more-half-/

What percentage of gun sales are done without a background check?
","Reacting to the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. that killed 17 people, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin spoke out for universal background checks -- that is, requiring them for every gun sale. The Wisconsin Democrat said universal checks are supported by 97 percent of gun owners, a claim we rated Mostly True, based on the latest national polling of households that have guns. Clearly, the checks -- the potential buyer shows identification, completes a federal form and goes through an instant criminal background check -- are not required for all gun sales. Indeed, under federal law, only federally licensed gun dealers, importers and manufacturers must run the checks. So, what percentage of guns are sold without a background check? Possible White House hopeful’s claim On March 7, 2018, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock -- a possible Democratic contender for president in 2020 -- visited Milwaukee to raise money for Wisconsin Democrats.   Interviewed by WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee, he touched briefly on guns, voicing support for universal background checks and saying: ""It makes no sense that a quarter of our guns are sold outside of the background checks."" So, Bullock’s claim is 25 percent. ‘Zombie’ claim After the Florida school shooting, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" that ""40 percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks."" But that was wrong. PolitiFact Florida rated his statement False. So did the Washington Post Fact Checker and FactCheck.org. All three agreed, and Sanders’ staff essentially acknowledged, he was using an outdated statistic from a 1994 study. Recent study The fact checks, and experts we contacted, instead cited a study authored by researchers from Northeastern and Harvard universities that was published in January 2017. They did an online survey, in 2015, of 1,613 adult gun owners. Among gun owners who said they obtained their most recent gun within the two previous years:
  22 percent overall said they obtained the guns without a background check. But that includes guns that were purchased or received in another way, such as through a gift or an inheritance. 13 percent who purchased firearms -- for example, from a friend or online -- said they had done so without a background check. The lower figure applies here, given that Bullock’s claim is about gun sales. Our rating Bullock says: ""A quarter of our guns are sold outside of the background checks."" The latest study that surveyed gun owners on the topic found that, among gun owners who had acquired a gun in some way within the previous two years, 22 percent had done so without a background check. That’s close to Bullock’s figure. But it takes into account people who acquired guns either by purchasing them, or by simply receiving them, for example as a gift. Among those surveyed who had purchased a gun within the previous two years, only 13 percent said they had done so without a background check. We rate Bullock’s claim Mostly False.

Donald Trump botches Japanese bowling ball on the car hood test
","President Donald Trump often speaks of how other countries treat American products unfairly. At a private fundraising event in Missouri, Trump singled out a particular practice in Japan. ""It's called the bowling ball test. Do you know what that is?"" Trump said, according to a recording obtained by the Washington Post. ""That's where they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air, and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify. Well, guess what, the roof dented a little bit, and they said, nope, this car doesn't qualify. It's horrible, the way we're treated. It's horrible."" The Washington Post noted, ""It was unclear what he was talking about."" So we wanted to look into it. We asked the White House press office what Trump had in mind and got no comment. In her regular press briefing, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump was just joking. However, we found something that loosely fits what he described. There are no bowling balls, and no 20-foot drop. But Japan’s National Agency for Automotive Safety and Victim Aid does what’s called a pedestrian head protection performance test. It’s designed to measure the force someone’s head would absorb if a car hit them. This involves firing a carefully calibrated hemisphere-shaped device (so, more like half of a bowling ball) at the hood and windshield. The device records the force. Here’s a graphic from the agency’s website:  Note that the largest head impactor is 4.5 kilograms, or about 10 pounds. So, the details about a bowling ball, the weight and the height of the drop are all wrong. But those details aside, Trump also got the purpose and nature of the test totally wrong. When he said, ""If the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify,"" that would be a test of the strength of the hood. In contrast, the test is all about a person’s head and the force it has to absorb in an accident. ""It’s the complete opposite,"" said Sean Kane, president of Safety Research and Strategy, a private firm that studies vehicle and consumer product safety. In fact, the more a hood dents or flexes, the better it is for the head of the unlucky pedestrian. ""It’s akin to any other type of crash,"" Kane said. ""You look at cars today, and the impact damage to cars is much greater. There’s a lot of crush, but that’s to absorb the energy and keep it away from people."" A biomedical engineering dissertation from Wayne State University made the same point: ""To lower head injury criterion, two main principles are necessary: provision of sufficient deformation space and provision of a low stiffness of the impacted vehicle body parts."" However, Trump got one element correct. American cars sold in Japan, at least all models made this decade, have to meet the Japanese safety standard. So Trump was correct that this is a hurdle for American car makers. It’s worth noting that Europe has a similar standard. In the early 2000s, the problem of cars hitting pedestrians was worse in Europe and Japan than in the United States. In Japan, for example, 27 percent of all traffic fatalities were pedestrians hit by cars. In the United States, it was 13 percent. ""The head impact test is a standardized test and has been there for many years,"" said Pankaj Mallick, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. ""Our car companies are very much aware of this, but at this time, there are no National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requirements to do this test for qualification of a car hood."" Kane noted that the United States stands out for having lower safety standards than Europe and Japan. ""If U.S. car makers wanted to make safer cars, they could sell them in both markets,"" he said. ""If they don’t, that’s a business decision."" Trump said that in Japan, ""they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify."" American cars must meet a Japanese standard. But Trump mangled the highly controlled process, which does not involve a bowling ball dropped from 20 feet. Where Trump really goes astray is on the purpose of the test; he has it backward. It’s not about seeing if the hood is strong. The more a hood gives way, the better it is for the head of a pedestrian. Trump’s understanding of the test is so far off the mark, we rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A4BDC0>],/factchecks/2018/mar/15/donald-trump/trump-botches-japanese-bowling-ball-test/

Website claims Democrats plan to abolish ICE if they win 2020 election
","Have Democrats announced plans to abolish one of the nation’s immigration enforcement agencies if they win the 2020 presidential election? That’s the headline of a March 11 story on yournewswire.com, but the text of the story did not support that claim, offering only calls from editorial writers and no presidential politicians as evidence.  Some left-leaning media outlets, immigrant rights advocates and a former spokesman for the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign have suggested ending U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but that’s different from claiming it will be part of a candidate’s platform. Here’s more to the story and it’s misleading headline. ""Senior Democrats have announced plans to completely abolish ICE if a Democratic candidate wins the presidential election in 2020,"" said the March 11 post. ""According to sources within the DNC, the abolition of the nation’s immigration enforcement agency looks likely to become a primary campaign issue in the Democrats’ 2020 presidential primary."" No sources were named. We reached out to the Democratic National Committee for comment but did not get a response. The story includes a few sentences contradicting its overarching claim. It said that Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., was asked on MSNBC if ICE should exist, and that her answer — ""certainly"" —  ""sparked a backlash among some liberals."" (In the interview, Harris said undocumented immigrants should be deported if they commit serious and violent offenses. ""ICE has a purpose. ICE has a role. ICE should exist."") Political pundits have speculated that Harris might run for president in 2020. But her stance of keeping ICE goes against yournewswire.com’s claim that Democrats announced they will abolish ICE if they win the 2020 election. The story does include legitimate examples of others calling for an end to ICE, including statements from Brian Fallon, former Hillary Clinton campaign spokesman, and posts published by some media organizations. Fallon on Jan. 21, 2018 tweeted that Democratic candidates in 2020 ""should campaign on ending the agency in its current form."" Jack Mirkinson, a news editor for the website Splinter, took it further in a story responding to Harris’ MSNBC interview, writing, ""ICE must be abolished. Anything less is not good enough."" The Nation published a piece on March 9 from researcher and writer Sean McElwee headlined, ""It’s Time to Abolish ICE."" Yournewswire.com notes that The Nation’s piece quotes Angel Padilla, policy director of the Indivisible Project, which describes itself as working to ""to defeat the Trump agenda, elect progressive leaders, and realize bold progressive policies."" Yournewswire.com included a tweet by MSNBC host Chris Hayes that linked to McElwee’s article and wrote, ""This is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it."" The Nation’s story mentions several Democrats running for Congress and for state offices who support defunding ICE. But it does not cite Democrats with plans to run for president in 2020 calling for ICE’s abolition. While there are calls from some Democrats running for state offices and Congress to defund ICE, yournewswire.com’s post offers no evidence of presidential hopefuls making such claims. It actually cites one possible presidential contender, Harris from California, as saying ICE should exist.

It is worth noting that public schools can teach about religion, according to a 1963 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. In Abington vs. Schempp, Associate Justice Tom Clark wrote for the court: ""It might well be said that one’s education is not complete without a study of comparative religion or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization. It certainly may be said that the Bible is worthy of study for its literary and historic qualities. Nothing we have said here indicates that such study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education may not be effected consistently with the First Amendment."" Nowtrump.com wrote that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that public school in the United States ""will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.""

Here's what's wrong about Donald Trump's attack on Canada trade deficit
","At a closed-door fundraiser in Missouri, President Donald Trump told the audience that during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, he just simply made up a fact without knowing if it was true or not. The Washington Post, citing leaked audio from the event, reported that Trump said, ""Nice guy, good-looking guy (Trudeau) comes in (and says) ‘Donald, we have no trade deficit.’ He’s very proud because everybody else, you know, we’re getting killed. … I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ "" Trump's comments came days after enacting a pair of landmark and controversial tariffs on steel and aluminum. On Twitter the morning after the Post's report, Trump doubled down, saying his claim was true after all. ""We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that’s how I know!"" We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that’s how I know! We wondered: Does the United States have a trade deficit with Canada? And does the United States have a trade deficit with ""almost all countries""? We found that Trump’s statement was somewhere between incomplete and misleading. Trump seems to be referring to a deficit in goods, which tells only part of the picture. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.) In 2017, the United States had a $23.2 billion deficit with Canada in goods. In other words, the United States in 2017 bought more goods from the Canada than Canada bought from the United States. However, the United States had a $25.9 billion surplus with Canada in services — and that was enough to overcome that deficit and turn the overall balance of trade into a $2.8 billion surplus for the United States in 2017. The same pattern occurred in 2016. Those unhappy with current trends in trade, such as Trump, tend to highlight the balance of trade in goods, since that subset of trade is the one that shows just how much manufacturing activity the United States has lost to foreign countries in recent years. By contrast, the United States has fared much better in services, which includes finance, insurance, legal services, business consulting and entertainment. ""Over the past 30 years, we have lost jobs in manufacturing, which produces goods, but gained a large number of very good jobs in service sectors and intellectual property,"" Matt Gold, an adjunct law professor at Fordham University, told PolitiFact in February. In services, by contrast, ""the U.S. dominates the world,"" Gold said. There’s a political connection here. Trump garnered significant support in the Rust Belt, which has been hit hard by trade deficits in goods, and he fared poorly in coastal and metropolitan areas that have benefited from the surge in services. It’s worth adding that a significant historical driver of the U.S. trade deficit in goods with Canada has been crude oil — a commodity that the United States has usually preferred to buy from Canada when possible, rather than from overseas suppliers that might be subject to greater political instability. It’s also a product for which the United States is increasingly less reliant on foreign sources overall. ""After you take out oil products from Canada’s exports to the U.S., the U.S. runs a massive trade surplus plus against Canada,"" to the tune of $49 billion in 2016, Daniel Trefler, a professor of economic analysis and policy at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, told PolitiFact in February. ""If we are talking about manufacturing jobs, the U.S. is a huge winner."" By our calculations, this is incorrect. We looked at the full list of countries and country equivalents that are tracked by the United States on trade balances to see whether the United States had a surplus or a deficit with them. We found 129 countries or country equivalents with whom the United States had a surplus in 2017, out of 234 entities listed overall. This means that the United States had a surplus in 55 percent of those countries, or a majority. Notably, this data refers to goods only; if we had the data for both goods and services, the percentage might go even higher, given the United States’ general advantage in services. We did find at least six major trading partners with whom the United States had a surplus in 2017 in goods and services: Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United Kingdom. The United States also had a sizable surplus with the entire region of South and Central America. That said, it’s reasonable to point out that for the United States, the biggest trade deficits are larger than the biggest trade surpluses. Here’s a rundown of the top 15 surpluses by country for 2017. (Data is for goods only.)   Rank Country Surplus in billions of dollars (goods only) 1 Hong Kong 32.5 2 Netherlands 24.5 3 United Arab Emirates 15.7 4 Belgium 14.8 5 Australia 14.6 6 Singapore 10.4 7 Brazil 7.6 8 Panama 6.0 9 Argentina 4.7 10 United Kingdom 3.3 11 Chile 3.1 12 Dominican Republic 3.0 13 Guatemala 3.0 14 Paraguay 2.6 15 Bahamas 2.5   And here’s a rundown of the top 15 deficits by country for 2017.   Rank Country Deficit in billions of dollars (goods only) 1 China 375.2 2 Mexico 71.1 3 Japan 68.8 4 Germany 64.3 5 Vietnam 38.3 6 Ireland 38.1 7 Italy 31.6 8 Malaysia 24.6 9 India 22.9 10 South Korea 22.9 11 Thailand 20.4 12 Canada 17.6 13 Taiwan 16.7 14 France 15.3 15 Switzerland 14.3 The 15 countries for whom the U.S. has the largest deficits combine to a cumulative $842.1 billion, which is more than five times larger than the combination of the 15 largest surpluses, at $148.3 billion. So among the United States’ largest trading partners, the biggest deficits are larger than the biggest surpluses. But that’s not what Trump said. A final note: Experts who support free trade say that arguing over deficits and surpluses misses the point. ""We should be running deficits with some countries and surpluses with others, since comparative advantage will vary, country by country,"" said I.M. (Mac) Destler, who teaches at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy.  Trump tweeted, ""We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive)."" On Canada, Trump’s statement is at best telling only part of the story. The United States currently has a trade deficit in goods with Canada, but the United States’ edge in services turns the overall balance of trade into a surplus for the United States. As for the world at large, Trump is wrong — the United States actually has a surplus with a majority of countries tracked in the official data. However, it’s reasonable to point out that among the biggest trading partners, trade deficits outpace trade surpluses in size.

Beto O'Rourke says parents told in PTA meetings that kids should create chaos to distract shooters
","Potentially fatal guidance for children has been conveyed to parents at PTA meetings while Congress avoids acting against guns used in school shootings, U.S. Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke told voters. At a Feb. 24, 2018, stop in Waco, the El Paso congressman said: ""How"" effed up ""is it that PTA meetings are now being conducted to help parents tell their kids what they are supposed to do when some guy with an AR-15 walks into their classroom – and you know what the message is today for those little third-graders and fourth-graders, and fifth graders – and I’m the father of a fifth-grader, a fourth-grader and a first-grader? The message today is you are supposed to create as much chaos as you possibly can. They want you to scream and yell and dance around and throw books and just keep moving."" O’Rourke went on: ""And when the question is asked, how in the hell is that going to save my 7-year-old, or my 11-year-old, or my 9-year-old, they say, well, it might not, but what it will do is it’ll buy some more time for the other kids in the class. It will take 10 seconds if no one does anything and they’re slaughtered like sheep. It’ll take 20 seconds if there’s movement and activity and chaos in the classroom, and yes, most kids will die, but maybe two or three are able to escape through an open door in the midst of that chaos."" O'Rourke, who subsequently won the Democratic nomination to face Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in November 2018, ranks among House sponsors of legislation to bar the future manufacture, sale or possession of 200-plus firearms including the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, which was first developed by gunmaker ArmaLite in the 1950s. The AR refers to ArmaLite rifle. As of 2016, there were between 6 million and 10 million of the rifles in U.S. circulation. The NRA refers to the style of weapon as a ""modern sporting rifle."" O’Rourke camp cites Facebook post We inquired into O’Rourke’s basis for saying parents are taught at PTA meetings to coach their kids to create chaos when a shooter walks in. By email, Chris Evans of O’Rourke’s campaign pointed us to a Feb. 14, 2018, Facebook post by Lisa Guthrie, who describes herself on Facebook as a resident of Redmond, a suburb of Seattle, Wash. Guthrie’s post says: ""At a recent PTA meeting, we brought in some of the police officers who work closely with our school district to talk about ALICE, which is their approach to handling active shooter situations."" ALICE stands for Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter and Evacuate, a response to campus intruders developed by the Ohio-based ALICE Training Institute. Guthrie’s post continues: ""One part of it is that if the shooter does enter the room where kids are at, the kids are told to run around, yell loudly, throw things like books or wads of paper, etc. Just be a distraction. At first I was like, really? You think a shooter armed with a machine gun is going to confront Samantha armed with a book and just say oh, never mind, I won't kill her? And then it punched me in the gut: If she's face to face with a shooter, she's going to die regardless. The goal will be for her and her classmates to make their deaths take 20 seconds rather than 10. That's 10 more seconds for other kids to run, 10 more seconds for first responders to get to the scene and take out the shooter. A lot of lives can be saved in 10 seconds...

""Just to be clear,"" Guthrie’s post says, ""this is the current state of affairs: We live in a country where kindergartners learn how to maximize the number of lives they can save as they're being massacred."" Institute emphasizes actions to distract classroom intruders We tried to message Guthrie on Facebook and didn’t hear back. But separately Shannon Parthemer, a spokeswoman for the Lake Washington School District, which serves students from Redmond, east of Seattle, confirmed by email that district officials have worked with law officers to train staff and students with ALICE trainings offered to parents ""so they can better understand what ALICE is and how its principles can help increase odds of survival and minimize the loss of life in the event of an aggressive intruder."" Schools hold ALICE drills, Parthemer said, with lessons modified based on kids’ ages. ""For example, young students (like kindergarteners), do ‘listening drills,’"" Parthemer said. ""These drills ask them to listen to the instructions of their teacher for a set period of time. This is a principle that would be important in the event of a true active shooter situation."" At least once a year, she wrote, ""our staff do an ALICE table-top exercise that allows them to talk through an active-shooter situation and determine what actions to take."" Then again, Parthemer wrote, ""these elements are not taught in the manner characterized"" by O’Rourke. Asked to elaborate, Parthemer stressed that the guidance that children distract an intruder comprises only part of the ALICE training. In elementary schools, Parthemer said, students ""are told to listen to their teacher and follow what the teacher asks them to do – lockdown, counter, evacuate, etc."" Parthemer otherwise connected us to Liz Hedreen, president of the Lake Washington PTSA Council, who responded by email that she didn’t attend a meeting like the one described in the Facebook post; the district, Hedreen said, has 41 PTSA chapters ""and each one runs their own meetings, so I don't have specific knowledge about what topics they have covered."" Hedreen said, though, she’d heard a presentation about ALICE training at PTSA meetings at a local high school. Hedreen also pointed out a February 2018 district communication to parents mentioning the ALICE trainings. What the ALICE Institute says The institute says on its website that its training sessions ""increase your children’s and employees’ odds of survival during a violent intruder event. ALICE Training,"" the institute says, ""goes beyond lockdown methods by providing individuals with a new set of skills that will greatly increase their odds of survival during an active shooter situation."" An institute video presents founder Greg Crane, a former police officer, saying that locking down a classroom can be viable strategy when a shooter enters a campus. ""But it can’t be the only response,"" Crane says. ""It is completely inadequate to teach people to only be passive and static when a determined attacker has decided they are his next victims."" Crane elaborates: ""There are no guarantees in life and we cannot guarantee that nobody will be hurt in a planned determined attack. But we do guarantee that by doing something instead of nothing, you will greatly increase the chances of your survival."" Another video shows students and school employees acting out what they’d do if an armed intruder entered their high school. The narrator says that after alerting others via the school’s intercom system, students start to evacuate. Next, a teacher is seen telling students: ""Guys, you need to grab some books. If the intruder walks in, we have to throw them at him."" The narrator says that when an intruder enters the classroom, throwing books and desks and yelling and ""even charging the intruder gives yourself and your students a better chance to survive."" Next, students throw books at a classroom intruder before rushing him and driving him to the floor:                SOURCE: ""ALICE Training,"" ALICE Training Institute, posted to YouTube Oct. 14, 2014 In another video, a teacher reads an institute book for children, ""I’m Not Scared, I’m Prepared!"" In the book, the teacher drills students to follow her directions if a dangerous person enters the school. The teacher says students should look around and pick up something ""easy to throw,"" such as a shoe, a block of wood, TV remote, paperback book, video game ""or even a plastic goat."" The teacher tells students to throw the items at the intruder before running zig-zag out of the school while waving hands and making strange noises. ALICE leader: Training about preparation We separately connected by phone with Crane, who lives in Texas. Nationally, Crane told us, the institute has touched down in every state with 3,700-plus districts having taken ALICE trainings and it wouldn’t surprise him that parents have learned of the institute’s guidance at PTA meetings, perhaps through presentations by local police. ""It’s all about preparation,"" Crane said. ""We have a choice to make. We can teach them to be passive and static or we can teach them to help themselves."" Disrupting or interrupting a shooter, Crane said, drives down his accuracy. ""If I can keep him from accurately targeting me, his miss rate goes up,"" Crane said. Crane noted too that a 2013 federal guide for schools states that if an active shooter enters a school, teachers and administrators have options other than locking down classrooms. The publication states: ""There are three basic options: run, hide, or fight. You can run away from the shooter, seek a secure place where you can hide and/or deny the shooter access, or incapacitate the shooter to survive and protect others from harm."" It goes on: ""As the situation develops, it is possible that students and staff will need to use more than one option. During an active shooter situation, staff will rarely have all of the information they need to make a fully informed decision about which option is best. While they should follow the plan and any instructions given during an incident, often they will have to rely on their own judgment to decide which option will best protect lives."" The guide also says: ""If neither running nor hiding is a safe option, as a last resort when confronted by the shooter, adults in immediate danger should consider trying to disrupt or incapacitate the shooter by using aggressive force and items in their environment, such as fire extinguishers, and chairs."" Texas PTA not pressing for ALICE trainings Crane told us that 20-plus Texas districts have participated in ALICE trainings. Earlier, when we asked the Texas PTA about whether meetings in Texas have talked up the ALICE approach, Kirk Ward, the group’s executive director, replied by email: ""Texas PTA has not organized or given direction for such meetings and trainings."" Our search of the Nexis news database led us to confirm that a Texas district held an ALICE training over two days in August 2017. A June 2017 news story in the Cleburne Times-Review described the Keene district signing up for ALICE training. That story quoted the district’s police chief, Ronny Potts, saying that in an ALICE training he’d attended, he learned that when teachers and students hide underneath their desks, they are ""sitting ducks."" ""With this ALICE training,"" Potts told the newspaper, ""we're wanting to give the kids their own opportunity to make decisions to do what they think is the right thing to do."" We got a phone update from Potts, who told us that by December 2017, employees at every district school had been trained in ALICE and, he said, the district had purchased 100 of the ALICE books intended for young children. ""I’ve never been a big fan of waiting for your demise under a desk,"" Potts said. Disrupting a shooter, he said, weakens his focus. ""What we’re trying to do is increase survivability."" Our ruling O’Rourke said ""PTA meetings are now being conducted to help parents tell their kids"" that if a guy with an AR-15 walks into their classroom, ""you are supposed to create as much chaos as you possibly can. They want you to scream and yell and dance around and throw books and just keep moving."" O’Rourke accurately described one part of the ALICE training employed in school districts including at least one in Texas and another in Washington state. Presentations also have been made to parents, we confirmed. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

Ted Cruz (in a song) says Beto O'Rourke wants open borders and to 'take our guns'
","Editor's note, Sept. 16, 2019: In response to Cruz’s recent complaint about this 2018 report, we published an explanation of our methodology: We rate statements based on the information known at the time the statement is made. For more detail, read our response.  Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas debuted a song the night of the Texas primaries setting Cruz on course to face Beto O’Rourke on the November 2018 ballot. It’s not a love song. The ditty portrays O’Rourke, a Democrat who represents El Paso in the U.S. House, as a liberal unelectable in Texas; voters there haven’t lifted a Democrat into statewide office since 1994. To the tune of Alabama’s ""If You’re Gonna Play in Texas,"" the singer opens: ""If you’re gonna run in Texas, you can’t be a liberal man."" Cruz's song contains a trio of factual claims. For starters, the singer says O’Rourke started calling himself Beto rather than his given name of Robert to ""fit in."" O’Rourke responded to that sally with a tweet showing a photo of the candidate as a boy wearing a shirt inscribed, ""Beto,"" tracing to his preschool days, O’Rourke told us by phone.                  SOURCE: Tweet, Beto O’Rourke, 1:26 p.m. March 7, 2018 The song's other claims touched off this fact-check: ""Beto wants those open borders/And wants to take our guns."" Without a doubt, we found, O’Rourke has objected to walling off the border and he favors a ban on civilian purchases of what critics call assault weapons including AR-15s, a type of semi-automatic rifle. However, he’s not called for opening the borders or for government agents to take guns from law-abiding residents. Open borders The concept of ""open borders"" drew the PolitiFact Truth-O-Meter initially when Donald Trump in 2016 charged Democrat Hillary Clinton with favoring open borders. Experts said then that making it easier for undocumented immigrants to obtain legal status wasn’t the same as getting rid of enforcement and allowing open borders. But there’s a longer history to ""open borders,"" which the U.S. essentially had for 85 years, the libertarian Cato Institute notes. ""From 1790 to 1875,"" the institute says, any ""immigrant from any country could legally enter, live and work in the United States."" Yet Congress subsequently regulated immigration decade after decade while nowadays, Cato analyst Alex Nowrasteh told us by email, there ""are no members of Congress who support ‘open borders’ or anything that even approaches it."" Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who authored a 2008 book on federal actions to tighten U.S. borders after 9/11, similarly told us he’s unaware of congressional advocates for opening our borders. ""It’s a derogatory term,"" Alden said by phone, ""that doesn’t have a whole lot of analytical meaning. It’s not even in the conversation in Washington,"" Alden said, where the focus since the 1990s has been on strengthening border security. Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier, asked the basis of Cruz’s ""open borders"" claim, pointed out that O’Rourke, an El Paso native and former member of the El Paso City Council, has been full-throated about opposing the border-long wall promised by President Trump as unlikely to improve security or the flow of trade. Also, she noted, O’Rourke has questioned the worth of existing border barriers. O’Rourke tweets and comments O’Rourke tweeted in January 2017: ""Less than zero. That's the amount of immigration we have from MX. More Mexicans going south than coming to the U.S. Do we need a wall?"" O’Rourke tweeted in April 2017: ""We already have a border wall that we don't need. Don't need more walls and militarization at a time that the border has never been safer."" An accompanying video shows O’Rourke standing in Hidalgo on the Texas-Mexico border and saying fencing there keeps Americans from fully enjoying a U.S. nature preserve. O’Rourke says: ""You tell me if this looks like a war zone or we need to militarize it or if it needs a wall."" O’Rourke told us by phone he doesn’t believe in open orders. Still, he said, ""we don’t need walls. We already have over 600 miles of walls, fencing and physical barriers in place. We don’t need them. They’re not making us safer."" Generally, O’Rourke said, ""it should be easier for people to legally cross the border at ports of entry where they have inspections by a customs officer."" He noted that in alignment with Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, he successfully advocated in 2013-14 for an uptick in customs officers and improvements to ports of entry. Rob Friedlander of O’Rourke’s House office answered our request for detail with emails pointing out matching port of entry infrastructure proposals filed in 2013 by Cornyn and O’Rourke and an omnibus measure signed into law in 2014 including language authorizing the government to enter into cost-sharing agreements at ports of entry and to accept donations toward building, maintaining or altering related infrastructure; the measure also authorized the addition of 2,000 customs agents at a cost of $256 million. O’Rourke’s campaign website We also checked O’Rourke’s campaign website for mentions of open borders. On a web page devoted to immigration, O’Rourke says ""the surest way to improve safety and security is not to build a wall or spend billions more, but to ensure that we are maximizing the potential from everyone in this state, treating each other with respect and dignity."" O’Rourke goes on to list six steps he favors including a ""Dreamer"" law giving residents who entered the U.S. as children paths to permanent legal residency and citizenship. The site includes no call for an open border. City of El Paso resolution From earlier years, Cruz’s camp pointed out a City of El Paso document showing that O’Rourke backed a council resolution objecting to previous federal plans to expand fencing near the border. That 799-word resolution, adopted unanimously in January 2009, says local fencing mandated by the Secure Border Fence Act of 2006 ""will only divide the El Paso/Juarez community and do nothing to advance a comprehensive approach to immigration reform."" The resolution also says ""the complex issues of illegal immigration and a porous border cannot be fixed by an enforcement-only approach. Any solutions must take a multi-layered approach to multi-layered issues created over decades of neglect."" Also, the resolution ""encourages the federal government to re-examine the construction of the fence along the entire southern border."" The resolution doesn’t include a pitch for opening the border entirely. O’Rourke in Congress So, has O’Rourke championed open borders in Congress? Alden noted by email that O’Rourke, who joined the House in 2013, voted that year with colleagues on the House Homeland Security Committee to approve a measure offered by the panel chairman, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, that included a goal for federal officers to apprehend 90 percent of people crossing the border illegally. We confirmed O’Rourke’s ""aye"" vote from the committee’s May 2013 report to Congress on its approval of the Border Security Results Act of 2013. Also spotted: A post-vote statement in the report, inserted on behalf of committee Democrats, objecting to officials trying to stop all illicit border activity. The statement from Rep. Bennie G. Thompson of Miss. says committee Democrats didn’t share the Republican majority’s view that ""striving to stop 100 percent of all illicit cross-border activity should be the attitude of every (Homeland Security) Department employee with a border security mission."" Thompson’s statement suggests such a focus could weaken security elsewhere: ""Specifically, we are concerned that asking DHS to interdict 100 percent of illicit cross-border activity between the ports of entry would unduly divert limited resources from other border security efforts, potentially undermining our nation's homeland security or economic security. Instead, Democratic members strongly support a comprehensive, risk-based approach to border security that would maximize our enforcement efforts both at and between the ports of entry, while facilitating the legitimate flow of cross-border trade and travel."" Taking guns As far as O’Rourke wanting to  ""take our guns,"" Cruz’s camp pointed out that O’Rourke was among sponsors of an unsuccessful 2015 House proposal, opposed by the NRA, to bar the import, manufacture and sale of ""assault weapons."" More recently, we found, O’Rourke ranks among cosponsors of the 2018 version of the legislation authored by Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I. The 2018 measure would bar the import, manufacture, sale or possession of any semi-automatic weapon--some 205 firearms, Frazier told us by email--or ""large capacity ammunition feeding device."" But the proposal also says the bar wouldn’t apply to any semi-automatic assault weapon or feeding device lawfully held before the act passes into law. O’Rourke told us by phone: ""My intent is for AR-15s not to be sold to the public."" A word: The AR-15 is a derivative of a semi-automatic rifle first developed by gunmaker ArmaLite in the 1950s. The AR refers to ArmaLite rifle, and does not stand for ""assault rifle."" As of 2016, there were between 6 million and 10 million of these semi-automatic rifles in U.S. circulation. The NRA refers to this style of weapon as a ""modern sporting rifle."" To our inquiry, Richard Luchette, a Cicilline aide, noted by email that the O’Rourke-backed proposal exempts from the ban 2,258 ""legitimate hunting and sporting rifles and shotguns that are named by make and model and specifically exempted from the ban. There are a couple other exemptions too – antique weapons, weapons used by the military and law enforcement, weapons owned at the time of the bill’s enactment, and any firearm that is operated by a bolt, pump, lever, or slide action,"" Luchette wrote. We noticed otherwise that the measure authorizes federal funds to be spent on government ""buy-back"" programs for semiautomatic assault weapons and ammunition feeding devices. But we saw no language authorizing or directing officials to take existing guns. Frazier, following up, said by email that removing from availability the weapons named in the legislation adds up to taking guns. ""The people of Texas deserve an explanation from him as to how his support for criminalizing the future sale, transfer and possession of such firearms, does not amount to coming after their guns,"" Frazier wrote. Other analysts For an outside analysis, we turned to Jaclyn Schildkraut, an assistant professor at the State University of New York at Oswego who has studied mass shootings. Schildkraut told us by email that despite the ban legislation lacking language calling for guns to be taken, ""gun rights advocates state that removing any one type of gun is effectively removing all guns."" Whatever the proposal explicitly says, Schildkraut said, it’d be impractical for the government to collect banned guns in part because there’s no federal registry showing who owns such firearms. ""Short of committing a crime or turning one in on your own, there’s no way they’d know you have it,"" Schildkraut said. We also heard back from Joseph Olson, a Mitchell Hamline School of Law professor emeritus and former member of the NRA’s board of directors. By email, Olson agreed the O’Rourke-cosponsored measure doesn’t call for taking guns up front. But, Olson said by email, there’s suspicion among gun-rights’ advocates that once such a proposal starts making its way into law, it’ll be amended by Congress to enable or even require the government to collect guns. Our ruling Cruz says in his song that O’Rourke wants ""open borders and wants to take our guns."" O’Rourke opposes President Trump’s avowed U.S.-Mexico border wall and also maintains that existing fencing he opposed in the first place doesn’t make us safer. But we didn’t spot evidence that O’Rourke wants U.S. borders open without restriction. O’Rourke backs a ban on the future sale and possession of about 200 kinds of guns including AR-15-style rifles. But the legislation he’s cosponsoring doesn’t provide for officials to take any guns held lawfully at the time the measure becomes law. We rate this Cruz claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

"['Congress', 'North Carolina', 'Mark Harris']","
Is Robert Pittenger among the 'most liberal' Republican congressmen?
","Rev. Mark Harris came within 134 votes of beating U.S. Rep. Robert Pittenger two years ago in the Republican primary for his seat, so he’s trying again this year. And to close the voting gap before the May 8 primary, Harris is questioning Pittenger’s conservative credentials. Pittenger has represented North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District since 2013, when he succeeded retiring Republican Sue Myrick. A Charlotte resident, Pittenger previously served in the state Senate and in 2008 ran unsuccessfully for Lt. Governor. In a recent newsletter, Harris criticized Pittenger for supporting a spending bill that raised the debt ceiling. ""Robert Pittenger showed us yet again why he is constantly rated as one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress,"" the newsletter says. There are 535 voting members of Congress (the House of Representatives and the Senate). Republicans control Congress with nearly 300 seats: 238 in the House and 51 seats in the Senate. The term ""most liberal"" is somewhat subjective. But PolitiFact wondered whether conservative watchdog groups have consistently singled out Pittenger as liberal since he won North Carolina’s 9th Congressional district in 2013. We reached out to the Harris campaign to see what ratings systems he’s referencing in the newsletter. What Harris said The primary source for the statement is a rating by Conservative Review, according to Harris campaign spokesman Andy Yates. Conservative Review is a website founded by Mark Levin, a controversial radio personality who has referred to Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell as a ""dummy"" and ""failure."" ""Pittenger has a 55% F grade with them. It is the second worst grade of any NC Republican House member (McHenry is the worst),"" Yates said in an email, referring to Rep. Patrick McHenry, who represents NC’s 10th Congressional district. ""Pittenger has consistently graded out as an F with this group which marks him as one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress."" Yates is right about Pittenger’s standing among the 10 other North Carolina Republicans in the House. Whether that puts him among the most liberal Republicans depends on how one defines ""most liberal."" According to Conservative Review’s scorecard, there are about 90 House Republicans – about 36 percent – who have lower ""Liberty Scores"" than Pittenger. Among those with lower scores than Pittenger: House Speaker Paul Ryan and majority whip Steve Scalise. Yates also cited Pittenger’s 2018 rating with FreedomWorks, which is zero. FreedomWorks is a libertarian-leaning advocacy group. The scorecard mostly covers fiscal policy, civil liberties and regulatory issues, said Jason Pye, vice president of legislative affairs at FreedomWorks. Pye referred to Pittenger as ""unreliable"" when it comes to reining in spending. Pittenger ""generally votes with leadership, and they like to bust spending caps and bust the budget — things we’re opposed to,"" Pye said. Pittenger has a ""Lifetime Score"" of 70 with the FreedomWorks. There are about 114 House members with lower lifetime scores than Pittenger. Pittenger’s score places him slightly to the right of California Republican Devin Nunes and slightly to the left of U.S. Sen. Richard Burr, also of North Carolina. Pittenger’s lifetime ratings on FreedomWorks or Conservative Review aren’t extremely liberal (or conservative.) To get a full picture of Pittenger’s record, we consulted other sources as well. What others said Pittenger votes out-of-step with the majority of Republicans 5.5 percent of the time, according to ProPublica. The group says that’s close to the average for Republicans in Congress. He has a score of 90 percent with Heritage Action for America, a watchdog group and think tank that says it ""turns conservative ideas into reality on Capitol Hill."" The average score for House Republicans is 68 percent. According to a vote tracker on FiveThirtyEight.com, Pittenger’s votes are aligned with Trump 96.9 percent of the time. And there are dozens of Republican House members who vote in-step with Trump less than Pittenger. He has a perfect score with FRC Action, which advocates for conservative social issues. As of 2016, Pittenger also had an 88 lifetime rating with The American Conservative Union, another leading conservative organization. The Club For Growth, which tracks legislation that affects the economy, gives Pittenger a lifetime score of 79 percent – which is in the middle-of-the-road for House Republicans. VoteView.com, meanwhile, says Pittenger is more conservative than 68 percent of Republicans in the House. It would be one thing if Harris said Pittenger isn't taking a strong enough stance on fiscal issues, even if it means voting against the party. Harris could make a case there. But, ""to make the assertion that Pittenger is one of the most liberal Republicans is a stretch too far,"" said Michael Bitzer, chair of the politics department at Catawba College in Salisbury, NC. Our ruling Harris said Pittenger is ""constantly rated as one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress."" We can’t find the results to back that up. So we rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097229B40>],/factchecks/2018/mar/15/mark-harris-nc/robert-pittenger-among-most-liberal-republican-con/

No, Seattle police didn't use a 'red flag' law to seize a man's gun with no warrant
","Seattle police seizing a man’s gun under the state’s ""red flag"" law has led to numerous false reports on right-wing websites that police arbitrarily took away a man’s Second Amendment rights. ""Seattle police begin gun confiscations: no laws broken, no warrant, no charges,"" stated a March 7 headline on Liberty Headlines. The story was attributed to Zero Hedge, which used a story from the website SHTFplan that claimed that Seattle police used ""Nazi style gun confiscation."" The same or similar stories have appeared on many right-leaning websites. The Liberty Headlines story said that police seized the man’s gun after neighbors had complained the man had been ""staring"" at people through storefront windows while wearing a holstered firearm. Other residents complained that the man’s open carrying made them feel ""uncomfortable"" and ""unsafe."" The story declared ""tyranny has officially taken hold on American soil"" and that ""a citizen’s Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government."" Sounds alarming. But it’s not accurate. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found that the headline was wrong and that the story failed to explain that police obtained a warrant from a judge after the 31-year-old man failed to turn over his gun and appear at a hearing, as ordered by the court. In 2016, Washington state voters overwhelmingly approved Initiative 1491 to allow courts, upon petition by police or a family or household member, to issue an extreme risk protection order. The order prevents an individual from accessing firearms for a specified time period if the court determines the person poses a significant danger. A handful of other states, including California, have similar ""red flag"" laws, and many other states are considering passing them. Following the Parkland shooting, Florida passed such a law to allow law enforcement to seek a risk protection order. While the NRA argues the laws violate a person’s rights by taking away a gun when no crime has been committed, law enforcement argues it is a tool they can use to take away a gun before a catastrophe occurs. PolitiFact interviewed Sgt. Eric Pisconski, who heads up the unit that oversees extreme risk protection orders, as well as Seattle police spokesman Det. Patrick Michaud. Police did not released the suspect’s name. PolitiFact submitted records requests to the King County prosecutor and obtained the criminal complaint that explains the charge against Alexander Sinclair McKenzie, an Army veteran with post traumatic stress disorder. Police said they had received multiple calls about McKenzie’s escalating behavior in the past year. McKenzie voluntarily surrendered a gun in 2017 after he was served with an anti-harassment order, even though he wasn’t required to do so. He acknowledged he was experiencing ""stress"" and did not want the gun around, Michaud said. Months later, McKenzie, who lives above a restaurant, had several interactions with the restaurant staff. In one instance, he stood in front of the restaurant and yelled obscenities and accused people of talking to him through the floor. ""No crimes were committed at that time, but his behavior was erratic and unnerving to all; resulting in contact"" by police, Michaud said. McKenzie declined services, but shortly thereafter he called police again to report ""taunting and voices"" coming from the restaurant below through the floor. He also told police that he was armed with a gun and wanted a female employee ""arrested or shot"" by police, Michaud said. McKenzie was ultimately taken to a medical facility. On Feb. 13, police petitioned the court to get an extreme risk protection order to take away McKenzie’s gun. A King County Superior Court Judge approved the order and police served it to McKenzie in person at a medical facility. He agreed to call police when he was discharged to hand over the firearm. After he left the medical facility on Feb. 23, police attempted to contact McKenzie multiple times to obtain his firearm. After McKenzie didn’t show up for his Feb. 27 court date about the order to turn over his gun, the judge granted a search warrant based on probable cause to arrest. McKenzie was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a person prohibited by extreme risk protection order, a gross misdemeanor. On March 1, police went to McKenzie’s apartment and took his gun. He was placed into custody and booked at the King County jail. The case remains pending. Pisconski said that since the law went into effect in 2017, Seattle police have received 16 extreme risk protection orders that resulted in collecting about 26 guns. This was the only case in which the suspect didn’t voluntarily surrender a gun. One of the websites that wrote that police took the gun without a ""warrant"" added an editor’s note about errors in its original article. The SHFTplan website, which has the tagline ""when it hits the fan, don’t say we didn’t warn you,"" updated the article to state that law enforcement did have a warrant. Liberty Headlines said, ""Seattle police begin gun confiscations: no laws broken, no warrant, no charges."" The headline and the story make it appear that Seattle police arbitrarily took away a man’s gun, and that’s not the case. Interviews with police officials showed that after police received numerous reports about a man’s troubling behavior, so they sought an extreme risk protection order from the court to remove the man’s gun. Police tracked down the man to inform him about the order. When the man failed to appear in court as ordered and didn’t turn over his gun, the judge signed off on the order that allowed police to arrest McKenzie. We rate this claim False.

Hannity's double standard on North Korea, Trump and Obama?
","An image shared widely on Facebook and Reddit chides Fox News host Sean Hannity for having a double standard on presidents talking to North Korea. It says that in 2008 Hannity said that President Barack Obama’s ""willingness to meet with North Korea is one of the most disturbing displays of Obama’s lack of foreign policy experience."" But  in 2018, Hannity said President Donald Trump’s ""willingness to meet with North Korea is a huge foreign policy win.""  We hit the transcripts and video files. For the most part, those words accurately reflect what Hannity said. A week before Election Day 2008, Hannity gave 10 reasons not to vote for Obama. No. 2 on his list concerned talking to unfriendly regimes. ""One of the most disturbing displays of Obama's lack of foreign policy expertise came during last year's YouTube debate,"" Hannity said Oct. 26, 2008. ""The junior senator from Illinois gave what many called a naive answer for a question from the audience about whether he would meet with the leaders of Syria, Venezuela, Cuba or North Korea without preconditions."" Asked during that debate if he would be willing to meet with those leaders without preconditions, Obama said ""I would,"" and compared that to previous presidents. ""Ronald Reagan and Democratic presidents like JFK constantly spoke to the Soviet Union at a time when Ronald Reagan called them an evil empire,"" Obama said. ""And the reason is because they understood that we may not trust them and they may pose an extraordinary danger to this country, but we had the obligation to find areas where we can potentially move forward."" The image mentioned only North Korea, while Hannity listed several countries. When news broke that Trump was open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Hannity voiced support. ""A huge foreign policy win for President Trump,"" Hannity said March 8. ""Little Rocket Man blinks. Now, the president’s tough rhetoric, his bold action, his severe sanctions, they appear to be working tonight. President Trump is accepting an invitation to meet with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un by May, and Pyongyang is agreeing to stop all nuclear and missile tests while these talks are underway. And the sanctions? They will continue."" So the text in the image matches what Hannity said. But his criticism of Obama and his praise for Trump came in the context of different policies. Obama’s policy on North Korea grew more complicated over time. But initially, it was fairly simple, said Penn State international affairs professor Joseph DeThomas. Preconditions meant that in order for talks to happen, North Korea had to agree that the purpose was the complete denuclearization of North Korea. ""During the campaign and early in his term Obama was very open to talks without preconditions,"" DeThomas said. For Trump, the picture is murkier. When Trump tweeted that he would meet with Kim Jong Un, North Korea had not taken any steps toward denuclearization. He said they had ""talked"" about it. ""Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean representatives, not just a freeze,"" Trump wrote. ""Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time."" Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned! But for North Korea, denuclearization applies to the entire peninsula, which has implications for the American presence and military posture in South Korea. That is not the same as simply agreeing to a North Korea without nukes. DeThomas said testing halts are customary during talks with North Korea. Beyond that, North Korea made no concessions or took any steps toward ending its nuclear program. Trump has imposed stricter sanctions and has been more ready to hint at using military force against North Korea. But in terms of having direct talks between the leaders of both nations, DeThomas said this administration set a lower bar than what previous presidents have demanded. ""The Trump precondition for talks was that North Korea had to halt nuclear and missile testing for some unspecified period of time prior to commencement of talks,"" DeThomas said. "" In February, Vice President Mike Pence drew headlines when he said sanctions and direct talks could happen at the same time. To some observers, that meant the administration was willing to talk without the precondition of North Korea agreeing to a future free of nukes. DeThomas characterized such words as ""loosey goosey,"" but not indicative of a major change. In that regard, when Hannity praised Trump, the administration’s overall policy was tougher than what Obama had articulated when he ran for president. But the fact remains that Trump had agreed to a meeting before North Korea had taken any concrete steps toward ridding itself of nuclear weapons. The side-by-side quotes cast Hannity as criticizing Obama for being willing to talk to North Korea while praising Trump for his willingness to do the same thing. The quotations are pretty much accurate. But the image glosses over the different policy preferences of each man at the time Hannity spoke. In 2008, Obama said simply there were no preconditions for a meeting with the leader. In 2018, Trump’s administration voiced some relaxation on preconditions, but not a full rejection of them. At the same time, Trump agreed to a meeting before North Korea had done more than agree to hold off on testing during any talks. The image leaves out some context, but overall, we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C03180>],/factchecks/2018/mar/14/blog-posting/hannitys-double-standard-north-korea-trump-and-oba/

Delta targeted in online free airline ticket scam
","An offer to participate in an online survey to get free Delta Airline tickets is a scam. ""Congratulations! You have been selected to take part in our short survey to get 2 Free Delta Airline Tickets! We only have 332 Tickets remaining so hurry up!"" states the website Delta-Flying.info. After we started our fact-check, the link was no longer in use and had been flagged as suspected phishing. It is not an official Delta website. Such hoaxes that Delta or other airlines, including Southwest Airlines, have been giving away free tickets have circulated for years. Don’t take the surveys — these are all scams. Graham Cluley, a security analyst, has previously written about the repercussions of the Southwest scam in 2016: ""The end result of all these shenanigans, of course, is to trick Facebook users into poor decisions – whether it be taking online surveys which earn affiliate cash for the scammers, signing up for expensive premium rate mobile services, or spamming the unwary with unwanted (and sometimes malicious) messages. .... If you are ever in any doubt as to whether a special offer on Facebook is genuine or not, visit the company’s real website to see if they mention the competition there – or whether they are warning of a scam."" Delta spokeswoman Kate Modolo pointed to this page on Delta.com where legitimate offers from the airline are located. The story that said Delta Airlines offers free airline tickets for people who take a short survey is a scam. We rate this story Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979FA780>],/factchecks/2018/mar/14/delta-flyinginfo/delta-targeted-online-free-airline-ticket-scam/

Fake news claims Miley Cyrus is leaving the country because Trump supporters are ruining her career
","In 2016, pop singer Miley Cyrus really did threaten to leave the United States if Donald Trump was elected president. New rumors have circulated on the Internet that Cyrus is now revisiting that promise and that Trump fans are ruining her career. ""Singer Miley Cyrus: ‘Trump fans are destroying my career, I can’t stand them and I decided to move to…’"" read the headline on Daily Washington Report, a blog providing no information about the nature of its content. The story was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The story cites real quotes by Cyrus from an interview she gave to Billboard magazine in 2017 where she openly spoke about becoming more political following the 2016 election. But the story then makes up new information regarding comments about Trump supporters. In the article, Cyrus claims to be dissatisfied with her career and blames Trump supporters for her not being a top-selling artist anymore. We found no evidence that Cyrus ever made those comments. Cyrus is also falsely quoted as saying that she believes the amount of hate she has received has to do with Trump supporters and that she will leave the United States if it continues. When searching for the quotes attributed to Cyrus, we found no results of the statements. Celebrity news fact-checking site Gossip Cop  also confirmed that Cyrus never accused Trump supporters of hurting her album sales. We did find an actual recent interview with Wonderland Magazine where Cyrus was featured on the cover. In that interview, she talked about expanding her career to work on different project, and being in a good place in her life right now. Cyrus’s latest album, Younger Now, released in September 2017, hit a peak of No. 3 on the Billboard charts. Even though last year Cyrus threatened to leave the United States if Trump was elected president, she recently backtracked, calling it ""ignorant"" to leave the country because of the president. Our ruling A fake news story said that Miley Cyrus is blaming Trump supporters for her discontentment with her career and that she is planning to leave the United States. Cyrus has recently expressed satisfaction of her career and life, and she specifically reversed her prior feelings on leaving the country. We rate this claim False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3AD4C0>],/factchecks/2018/mar/14/blog-posting/fake-news-claims-miley-cyrus-says-trump-supporters/
