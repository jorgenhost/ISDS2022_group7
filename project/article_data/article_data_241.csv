BuzzFeed ‘awesome fact’ about toothbrush and toothpaste sales in R.I. turns out to be awesomely wrong
","Hey fans of Rhode Island trivia! Did you know that in the capital city of Providence ""it's illegal to sell toothpaste and a toothbrush to the same customer on a Sunday""? Neither did we. But that's what we were told in a July 14 feature titled ""11 Awesome Facts You Never Knew About Rhode Island,"" listed on the popular news and entertainment website BuzzFeed. Here at PolitiFact, we had two questions. First: Is that really true? Second: Who thinks the inability to buy a toothbrush and toothpaste together on a Sunday is awesome? For the uninitiated, BuzzFeed,  which regards itself as a legitimate news website, is always trying to take a hot topic and make it hotter. BuzzFeed loves lists. Its July 19, 2013 home page featured ""The 33 Fluffiest Animals On The Planet,"" ""38 Things Catholic Girls Love"" (#7 is ""Pancakes."" No explanation is offered), and ""14 Not-At-All Gratuitous Breast Ads (Note to BuzzFeed: They ARE gratuitous)."" We had our doubts about some of the other items on the Rhode Island list. (For example, we couldn't find any reference in state law to BuzzFeed's contention that ""It is illegal to throw pickle juice on a trolley in Rhode Island."") We decided to focus on the toothbrush claim because we don't want Providence residents to be at a disadvantage when it comes to dental hygiene. We emailed BuzzFeed and asked for its source. We also checked Rhode Island law to see if there was a toothpaste-toothbrush statute that applied to Providence (or any community). We came up with nothing. We also checked the online version of Providence's city ordinances. We found nada. Then we called Providence City Hall and spoke to Deputy City Clerk Lori Hagen, who indulged us and did her own check. She found zip. The ordinances don't contain any derivative of the word ""tooth."" If it existed, ""it would be in the code of ordinances,"" Hagen said, adding that she's never heard of any such restriction. She's worked for the city for 24 years. We thought it might be an old ordinance, repealed long ago. City Archivist Paul Campbell came up with bupkis.   When we heard back from BuzzFeed, spokeswoman Augusta Mellon said in an email that a Google search for ""sell toothbrush toothpaste sunday rhode island"" produced over 8 million hits. (We checked that claim as well. Actual number of hits: about 650, and some of those didn't even refer to the ""law."") Mellon said, ""There's multiple accredited sources that have written about it, including the Brown Daily Herald and the Telegraph"" in Australia. The unnamed blogger for the Herald, Brown University's student newspaper, reported buying both items at a local CVS, insisted that the prohibition was real, and treated the purchase like an act of civil disobedience. The blogger's source turned out to be a list at DumbLaws.com, which cites no actual law, past or present. At least the Telegraph story begins: ""Here is a list of the world's most ridiculous laws or urban myths - we’re not quite sure."" BuzzFeed's Mellon ended her email by saying, ""It seems like it's a commonly referenced piece of information."" She should have added, ""Which nobody ever checks."" So oral hygiene fans can breathe a minty-fresh sigh of relief. A toothbrush and toothpaste can legally be purchased together any Sunday in Providence. Maybe someday this PolitiFact item will be part of a BuzzFeed list titled ""217 Examples of How BuzzFeed Didn't Check Its Facts."" It'll be a hot one because we give the website a Pants on Fire!

Newt Gingrich says gangs have increased by 40 percent since Barack Obama was elected
","More than a week after a Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty in the shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin, CNN’s State of the Union hosted a roundtable that included a discussion of crime and race in America. Among the panelists was Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker from Georgia. ""Gangs have increased by 40 percent since this president was elected,"" Gingrich said. ""There is no federal program to stop it. No one wants to have an honest conversation about it."" It wasn’t the first time Gingrich had made this point. In an op-ed, Gingrich wrote, ""Although the president does not acknowledge the gangs' role as a major cause of the epidemic of violence, the FBI does. The FBI estimated in 2011 that there are roughly 1.4 million active gang members in the U.S., an astonishing 40 percent increase from 2009. These gangs, the FBI says, are responsible for ‘an average of 48 percent of violent crime in most jurisdictions, and much higher in others.’ "" We were able to locate the FBI study Gingrich referred to in the op-ed -- the 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment. Gingrich accurately quoted the report, which said, ""Approximately 1.4 million active street, (outlaw motorcycle) and prison gang members, comprising more than 33,000 gangs, are criminally active"" in the United States, which ""represents a 40 percent increase from an estimated 1 million gang members in 2009."" (The 1 million figure came from the 2009 edition of the same FBI study.) Because Gingrich’s 40 percent figure comes from federal statistics, we agree that it has some credibility. But we will raise two issues of concern. Uncertainty about the statistics Because gang activity is illegal, it’s difficult to get solid numbers. So the FBI estimated as best it could. To do this, the FBI used a combination of data from a survey of law enforcement agencies by the National Drug Intelligence Center, along with additional interviews with law enforcement officials. The survey the FBI used randomly sampled roughly 3,000 state and local law enforcement agencies to gauge how prevalent gangs are in their jurisdiction. This is a reasonable approach to tackling a challenging question, but it’s not gospel. Criminologists warned PolitiFact to be wary of several factors. • The survey is not just an estimate -- it’s an estimate of estimates. All surveys are subject to sampling error -- that is, the possibility that the people being surveyed aren’t actually random, thus biasing the results. But at least many surveys sample something that the respondent will find easy to quantify -- say, whether they approve of the job President Obama is doing, or how many cars they own. The survey the FBI used, however, has uncertainty not just about whether the sample was truly random, but also about whether the answers given are actually accurate. The report itself ""acknowledges that there may be some duplication or underreporting of gang members"" because of how each state and local law enforcement agency measures gang activity in their area. • The smell test. A jump of 40 percent in just two years is an enormous increase, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. ""If there were really a 40 percent increase in two years, you would see a big impact on crime statistics generally, but we haven’t,"" he said. ""Crime rates are fairly level."" • Who counts as a gang member? There’s no universal definition of who counts as a gang member. ""Actual gang members can deny membership, and wanna-bes can claim membership,"" said Eugene O’Donnell, a criminologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""In both cases it is difficult to discern for sure."" • Institutional bias. Local law enforcement officials have an interest in overstating -- or at least not understating -- the number of gang members in their jurisdiction, since a bigger gang problem can help them secure more federal assistance, O’Donnell said. This wouldn’t be so much of a problem for the soundness of the data if an independent assessment was also factored in, but none is. The estimate is based solely upon the opinions of state and local law-enforcement officials. All in all, O’Donnell said, ""there are multiple grounds for being skeptical"" about the estimate. Making significant public policy decisions based on them would be manifestly unsound."" Does Obama deserve blame? Gingrich said, ""Gangs have increased by 40 percent since this president was elected."" If he had said ""between 2009 and 2011,"" we wouldn’t have addressed the issue of whether he was blaming the president. But Gingrich chose to use Obama’s presidency to mark time. The Gingrich camp firmly disagrees that the former House speaker was blaming Obama for an increase in gang activity. They point to previous op-eds -- including the one we mentioned earlier -- as evidence that Gingrich was simply saying that crime issues that inspire a lot of media attention -- such as mass shootings and the Martin case -- obscure a more far-reaching crime concern, gangs. ""Newt mentioned Obama to make that contrast – in other words, ‘Is a Trayvon Martin-type occurrence really what is most important to be focused on when it comes to the personal safety of African-Americans?’"" said Joe DeSantis, a spokesman for Gingrich. ""After all, the president had just held a press conference to talk about the Martin verdict. Newt did not say that Obama was to blame for the increase in gang violence."" The Gingrich camp is correct that he has made that argument in previous op-eds, but we didn’t see him mentioning it in the CNN discussion. And because a CNN viewer most likely wouldn’t have read Gingrich’s past op-eds, we think it’s fair to rate him in part for bringing Obama into the discussion of gang growth. There are, in fact, some things that an administration can do to bolster law enforcement generally and gang activity specifically. Contrary to Gingrich’s claim that ""there is no federal program to stop"" gangs, the Justice Department does have an Organized Crime and Gang Section, which was established under Obama in late 2010 as a consolidation of several existing offices. However, while federal funding and technical assistance can help, Fox said that ""there’s relatively little that the president can do to discourage a 12-year-old from joining a gang."" Most gang activity is handled by local law enforcement departments, and both demographics, including the number of young people in an area, and economic conditions are important drivers of gang membership. ""Gangs are always hiring, even when legitimate employers aren’t because the economy is in bad shape,"" Fox said. And in recessions, he added, ""younger, inner-city people are hit especially hard."" Our ruling Gingrich said that ""gangs have increased by 40 percent since this president was elected."" Gingrich deserves credit for using statistics from a credible federal agency, but it’s important to note that methodological difficulties make it hard for anyone, even the FBI, to determine how many gang members there are in the United States. Criminologists express skepticism about whether gang membership could have jumped 40 percent in just two years, saying that broader crime statistics don’t show any sign of it. In addition, despite the Gingrich camp’s insistence that he did not mean to cast blame on Obama for the rise in gang membership, we think that a reasonable viewer of the discussion could have made such an inference. On balance, we rate the claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/682949c8-0c99-4bd5-959a-cf2953e8cfce",/factchecks/2013/jul/24/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-gangs-have-increased-40-percent/

Homicides of blacks have tripled since 'stand your ground' was passed in Florida, Jesse Jackson says
","Rev. Jesse Jackson called for a boycott of Florida, which he labeled an ""apartheid state"" after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin. ""No doubt ... the inclination (is) to boycott Florida, to stop conventions, to isolate Florida as a kind of apartheid state given this whole 'stand your ground' laws,""Jackson said on CNN July 18. ""Homicides against blacks have tripled since this law has been in existence. Now more homicides and more guns make us less secure."" On July 13, a jury acquitted Zimmerman, a white Hispanic volunteer neighborhood watchman, in the death of Martin, an unarmed black teenager killed in Sanford in 2012. Zimmerman claimed self-defense. The case has sparked much discussion about the impact of the ""stand your ground"" law in Florida -- particularly for the black community.   After Jackson made his remarks, several readers emailed us: Is Jackson correct that since the law passed, homicides of black victims have tripled? Data on black homicide victims in Florida Signed into law by then-Gov. Jeb Bush in 2005, Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law says a person has ""no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony."" The Florida Department of Law Enforcement emailed PolitiFact data showing the number of black homicide victims each year. Since ""stand your ground"" went into effect part way through 2005, we started the clock ticking in 2006. Here are the number of black homicide victims each year: 2006: 524 2007: 573 2008: 564 2009: 494 2010: 452 2011: 476 2012: 532 That shows the sheer number of black homicide victims between 2006 and 2012 barely changed: it rose from 524 to 532. (Even if we did include 2005 -- which wouldn’t be a fair analysis since the law went into effect part way through the year -- we would not find the number of homicides of black people tripled. The number rose from 428 in 2005 to 532 in 2012, or a 24 percent increase.) We also looked at the number of homicides of black people as a percentage of the total number of homicides and did not find they tripled. Justifiable homicides So where did Jackson get this idea that homicides of black people had tripled? We aren’t certain, since Jackson’s Rainbow PUSH Coalition did not respond to our questions. However, we suspect that he might have been referring to justifiable homicides by civilians. Reports of justifiable homicides tripled after ""stand your ground"" went into effect, the Tampa Bay Times reported in October 2010 based on FDLE data. (The Times and Miami Herald are partners in PolitiFact Florida.) Later in the CNN interview, Jackson seems to be referring to these numbers. After a question specifically about the ""stand your ground,"" Jackson said, ""There has been a triple increase in these shootings since this law has been in effect."" If what he meant by ""these shootings"" were justifiable homicides, then Jackson was on track. But that’s different from the statement he made earlier. (Read more about the increase in justifiable homicides.) Our ruling During an interview on CNN about Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law Jackson said: ""Homicides against blacks have tripled since this law has been in existence."" The law was enacted part way through 2005. The number of homicides in which black people were the victims fluctuated from year to year between 2006 and 2012 and didn’t come anywhere close to tripling. It’s possible Jackson is confusing homicides with justifiable homicides, but that’s a key qualifier that he omitted in part of his comments. We’re rating his statement that homicides against blacks have tripled. That’s not accurate, so we rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2013/jul/24/jesse-jackson/homicides-blacks-have-tripled-stand-your-ground-wa/

Barack Obama says millions benefit from insurance company rebates
","
President Barack Obama is trying to get ahead of a steady rain of attacks on his signature health care reform law, the Affordable Care Act. With House Republicans voting to delay key elements of the law and Americans for Prosperity, a well-funded conservative group, running television ads to stir sentiments against it, Obama focused on health care when he spoke last week at the White House briefing room. 
Among the changes due to the law, the president touted the tangible benefit of consumer rebates from insurance companies that have spent too much on administrative overhead. 
""Last year, millions of Americans opened letters from their insurance companies,"" Obama said. ""But instead of the usual dread that comes from getting a bill, they were pleasantly surprised with a check. In 2012, 13 million rebates went out, in all 50 states. Another 8.5 (million) rebates are being sent out this summer, averaging around 100 bucks each."" 
In this fact-check, we examine whether millions of Americans received rebates on the scale the president described. 
Why we have rebates in the first place 
Part of the law requires health insurance companies to spend at least 80 percent of each premium dollar to provide care, rather than cover administrative expenses. There’s some wiggle room on the 80 percent, but by and large, this is called the medical loss ratio and people speak of it as the 80/20 rule. If an insurance company spends less than 80 percent, it must send the difference back to the customer. That is the rebate. 
Most insurers already meet the standard. The Government Accountability Office said that in 2010, two-thirds of the firms passed muster. But behind that figure was an important difference among insurance policies. For companies selling to large employers with over 100 workers, 77 percent were in compliance. For those selling to small employers with 100 or fewer workers, 70 percent met the grade. But in the individual market, where people buy their insurance directly and don’t get it through their employer, only 43 percent of firms met the 80/20 rule. 
Obama’s numbers 
At one level, the official data tells all. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services track all rebates and indeed, in 2012, insurance companies returned $1.1 billion to about 12.8 million policy holders. In 2013, the dollars are about half as much and about 8.5 million policyholders benefit. The average rebate is $98, which is pretty close to Obama’s $100. Over 2.7 million households in the individual market received a rebate directly. 
We should note, though, that 61 percent of the rebate money went to employers. That is to be expected since about 85 percent of all people with private insurance get their coverage through their employer. The employer buys the insurance so the employer gets the rebate. 
Nearly all the time, the employer and the employee share the cost of health care premiums, and the law requires that the rebate be split proportionately. It gives employers the option to pay workers their share in a lump sum, reduced premiums in the future or ""applying the rebate in a manner that benefits its employees."" 
We have not found any government agency that tracks how firms share the rebate. We did find this guidance to employers from the U.S. Labor Department. It said the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) applies and as far as what companies do with the rebate, employers ""must act prudently, solely in the interest of the plan participants and beneficiaries."" 
One final point. Individuals saw a rebate check more often than you would expect. These customers represent just 15 percent of the private insurance market. But they made up 32 percent of the households that got rebates. 
Our ruling 
Obama said ""millions of Americans opened letters from their insurance companies"" and got rebates from  companies that failed to spend at least 80 percent of premiums on care. Then he talked about 13 million rebates going out last year and about 8.5 million this year. Those numbers are generally accurate. 
But while Obama gets the numbers right, he left a misleading impression about the rebates going directly to so many people. In fact, more than half of the rebates went to the employers that run health plans for their workers. Federal law says the employers have to use the money on health care, but they can also use it shore up the health plans. So not all of these policy holders are getting $100 directly. For these reasons, we rate Obama's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2013/jul/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-millions-benefit-insurance-compa/

Postal Service claim not fully on target
","
There’s been a lot of conversation lately about proposed cuts to the U.S. Postal Service, particularly the idea of ending Saturday delivery. 
PolitiFact Georgia reader Wallace Cooper said he was skeptical about a specific claim in a recent television ad about the taxpayer cost of delivering the mail and asked us to do some fact-checking. 
""Members of the American Postal Workers Union handle more than 165 billion letters and packages a year. That’s about 34 million pounds every day. Ever wonder what this costs you as a taxpayer? Millions? Tens of millions? Hundreds of millions?"" a voice says in the 30-second ad. 
The answer: ""Not a single cent."" 
Deliveries are solely funded by stamps and postage, the voice says. 
The ad was put together by the American Postal Workers Union. The union writes on its website that the ad was created to combat ""detrimental legislation."" 
The Postal Service boasts that nothing will keep its mail carriers from their appointed rounds. We at PolitiFact Georgia share a similar intrepid ethic regarding getting to the bottom of a claim. So what did we find? 
The Postal Service says on the facts page of its website that it does not receive tax dollars for its operations, but some context is necessary here. 
First, let’s look at its current situation. 
Before 1971, the Postal Service received annual appropriations from the federal government. Since then, it has operated independently, with revenues generated through the sales of postage stamps and services. 
But Congress does give the Postal Service $100 million a year to compensate the agency for revenue loss by providing, at congressional direction, free mailing privileges to blind people and overseas voters, a congressional report noted. The $100 million is less than 1 percent of the Postal Service’s annual budget. 
In 2012, the Postal Service pulled in about $65 billion in revenue, it says on its website. That’s $10 billion less than what collected in 2008, the year the Great Recession took hold. By some reports, the Postal Service is losing $25 million a day. The volume of mail the Postal Service handles has declined by nearly 27 percent since 2008, as Americans rely more on email  communications instead of letters. 
The Postal Service’s debt rose from nothing to $10.2 billion between federal fiscal years 2005 and 2009, according to a congressional report. The federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1 and concludes Sept. 30. 
Another congressional report found Postal Service operating costs may be the largest reason for its financial troubles. In 2006, Congress passed legislation requiring the Postal Service to pre-fund its future retirees’ health benefits at a cost of approximately $5.6 billion per year. 
The Postal Service has cut expenses through a hiring freeze, offering early retirement to longtime employees and closing some district offices. It’s also increased revenue in recent years through several increases in the price of a postage stamp. 
In 2009, the Postal Service began borrowing money from the U.S. Treasury Department to deal with its troubles. Some news accounts report the service reached its borrowing limit of $15 billion in September 2012. 
Sally Davidow, a spokeswoman for the union, said the Postal Service had to borrow the money to offset the health benefit changes. She argued that health benefits are not part of the Postal Service’s operating expenses. 
""(The Postal Service) is required to pay that money back,"" Davidow added. ""Borrowing money is different than relying on taxpayers."" 
Davidow argued in the union’s defense that the Postal Service has $46 billion in its retiree health benefits fund, but the federal government won’t let the agency borrow from it. 
The Postal Service wrote in a November 2012 press release that it had a record fiscal year deficit of nearly $16 billion. The agency attributed about 70 percent of that net loss to the health care requirement. 
To sum up, the American Postal Workers Union claimed in its television ad that the U.S. Postal Service doesn’t operate on taxpayer dollars and and it’s solely funded by stamps and postage. The Postal Service has borrowed money from the government in recent years, primarily it says, to cover the cost to pre-fund employee health benefits. 
The first part of the statement is on target. The second part, however, gets a return to sender.

Are Jay Z, Justin Timberlake and Rihanna joining Stevie Wonder's Florida boycott?
","Did you hear? Dozens of the world’s hottest musical acts are joining music legend Stevie Wonder in protest of Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law after the George Zimmerman trial, according to social networks and the blogosphere. Memes zooming through social media name two dozen artists that have canceled their tour dates in the Sunshine State indefinitely ""UNTIL THE LAW IN FLORIDA IS ABOLISHED!"" The list is populated with world-famous acts such as Justin Timberlake, Jay Z, Rihanna, Rod Stewart, Patti LaBelle, the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Alicia Keys, Usher, will.i.am, R. Kelly, Trey Songz, Mary J. Blige, Kanye West, Ciara, Kelly Rowland and other groups. Timberlake is singled out for nixing the kickoff of his tour in Miami because he refused ""TO ENTERTAIN A STATE WHO’S GOVERNMENT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SHOOT-N-KILL UN-ARMED TEENAGERS!"" The PSA first caught PolitiFact Florida’s eye when it was shared in Instagram. Then the list got more attention when versions of it trickled into mainstream coverage. We are skeptical of chain emails and the like that are typed in ALL CAPS, contain misspellings and do not disclose their sources. The meme we’ve seen (which touts the misspelled names of RIHANA and ALISHIA KEYS as signing on) is a triple whammy. We decided to investigate whether dozens of high-profile acts are really joining Wonder and boycotting Florida. Our synopsis: Just because it’s in the news does not make it true. Adding names to Stevie Wonder's boycott  Talk of Florida boycotts started July 14, the day after Zimmerman’s ""not guilty"" verdict in the death of Trayvon Martin. Wonder announced then in Quebec City that he will never again perform in Florida until the 2005 ""stand your ground"" law is abolished. He took it a step further: ""As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world."" (More than 20 other states have similar ""stand your ground"" laws.) Several musical artists and celebrities reacted to the verdict with anger and disbelief. Many gave musical tributes to Martin, including Beyoncé, Young Jeezy, Jay Z and Justin Timberlake, Patti LaBelle, Bruce Springsteen, and Wyclef Jean. But none of the artists on the Instagram list -- even those who have spoken out against the verdict -- publicly announced they are joining Wonder’s boycott. We checked social media accounts, websites and news reports and found no declarations of support for the boycott from the people on the list. Still, it wasn’t long before the story crossed over into news coverage. American Urban Radio Networks reporter April Ryan cited ""sources close to Stevie Wonder camp"" for her July 22 report that claimed a similar slate of artists are joining him in support of changing ""stand your ground."" Some have already called off concerts, she wrote. Her AURN report was picked up by congressional newspaper The Hill and the Huffington Post on July 22, read and shared by thousands. The next day, even more newspapers picked it up but tried to add a little more caution (including the Tampa Bay Times). Ryan’s list contained two groups that were not on the Instagram roundup: Eddie Levert, lead singer of the R&B group The O’Jays, and gospel duo Mary Mary ""We love our fans but we MUST do something!!"" Mary Mary wrote on Facebook. ""We understand a No from us isn’t as big as a No from Stevie Wonder but if all our voices join together we can REALLY change things!"" These are the only artists from Ryan’s list of 23 artists who have announced they are joining Wonder’s effort. Ryan has since updated her post with a disclaimer: I obtained from multiple sources early Monday a list of artists and entertainers who my sources told me had committed to a boycott of Florida following the George Zimmerman acquittal. Since publishing that list I have heard from several representatives of the artists named who say, on behalf of their clients, they are uncomfortable being identified on that list and are seeking additional information. The Huffington Post, hearing from artists' reps that the list was not true (but not willing to go on the record), later wrote a story discrediting its original post. The shows still go on We did our own reporting. Most of the artists do not have upcoming tour dates in Florida. Rihanna, for example, was just in Tampa in April. Madonna is not on tour. ""This leg of Rod Stewart's tour hasn't ever included Florida dates so that isn't accurate,"" said Hannah Kampf, a spokeswoman for Stewart. Madonna did not join the boycott, spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg told us. Neither did Alicia Keys, whose spokeswoman said in a statement, ""We question the validity of this list since Alicia's name along with many others has appeared erroneously."" A spokeswoman for the Rolling Stones told Mother Jones no one in the band had ""heard anything about this.""  Timberlake and Jay Z do have their shared ""Legends of the Summer"" concert on Aug. 16 at Sun Life Stadium in Miami. Timberlake has another concert planned for December in Orlando. If the show is off, no one told the ticket vendors, updated either artist’s website or informed the venues. Sun Life Stadium tweeted us that the concert ""is on as scheduled.""  Funk maestro George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic, also named among artists boycotting Florida, is scheduled to play in Tallahassee on July 28. We found nothing to contradict that. And funk stars Maze and Frankie Beverly are still slated to perform at the Mahaffey Theater in St. Petersburg on Sept. 15, a spokeswoman confirmed to tbt*, a daily tabloid published by the Tampa Bay Times. Our ruling The Internet is rife with claims of Stevie Wonder’s beefed-up Florida boycott. It’s short on proof. Most of the stars identified in social media lists may have spoken out against the verdict or in support of Trayvon, but we haven’t seen them go the extra mile and call off shows until the ""stand your ground"" law is abolished. With the exception of two smaller acts that aren’t included in some iterations of the meme, we could not find evidence to back up the notion that scores of acts are joining up with Wonder's boycott. We rate this statement False. We updated this check after publishing with comments from representatives for Madonna and Alicia Keys.",/factchecks/2013/jul/23/instagram-posts/are-jay-z-justin-timberlake-and-rihanna-joining-st/

Florida National Guard members fought overseas now face 20 percent pay cut
","
We’ll start with this fact: Gov. Rick Scott hearts the Florida National Guard. But as Scott lambasts the impact of federal budget cuts on the Guard, is he telling the truth? 
""The FL Guard has defended our freedom in Afghanistan, Iraq, and put their lives at risk; now the fed govt is going to cut their pay 20%"" Scott said on Twitter July 16. 
Those are some fighting words about the automatic spending cuts known as sequestration. Are Florida Guard members who fought overseas now getting their pay slashed by 20 percent? 
Scott’s office directed us to the Florida National Guard for answers. We will draw from information from the Guard and U.S. Defense Department, as well as our previous fact-check stemming from a feud between Scott, a Republican, and Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat, about the impact of sequestration on the Florida National Guard during a hurricane. 
Who exactly is getting furloughed 
The pay cut Scott mentioned refers to 11 furlough days for some members of the National Guard between July and September. That translates to a 20 percent cut in take-home pay during that time period -- not the entire year, said Lt. Col. James Evans, a Florida National Guard spokesman. 
About 966 employees in Florida face furloughs. (The precise number changes frequently due to new hires and those leaving the workforce.) The vast majority -- more than 900 -- are uniformed military technicians, also known as dual-status military technicians. 
The Miami Herald recently reported on their specific duties: ""They are Guard members known as technicians, who draw their wages from federal funds in a range of jobs — from mechanics who maintain armored vehicles to public affairs specialists who write articles. While most Guard members are part-timers when not deployed, the nearly 1,000 so-called technicians are full-time federal civil service employees. Most work in northeastern Florida."" 
Evans described the technicians as ""the uniformed day-to-day backbone of our full-time force"" and pointed out they are the only ""troops in the Department of Defense that are NOT exempt from furlough under Sequestration."" 
The Florida National Guard has 12,000 members. About 10,000 are those who train one weekend a month plus two weeks a year and hold outside jobs. These Guard members are not federal employees and don’t face furloughs, Evans said. 
Of the remaining 2,000 who work for the Guard year round, half are active guard and reserves -- such as those who patrol the airfield at Homestead in South Florida -- and don’t face furloughs. The other half include the military technicians and civilians who are paid from an account subject to furloughs. 
So we could say that about 8 percent of the Florida National Guard (966 of 12,000) face furloughs or, like Scott, we could say half of the state’s full-time force face furloughs. 
""If their unit goes to war, they go to war with them. They are a military member,"" Florida Guard legislative director Lt. Col. (Ret.) Glenn Sutphin told PolitiFact Florida. 
So how many of the furloughed guard members have fought in Iraq or Afghanistan? 
Of the employees taking furloughs, about 40 percent, or 385, have deployed since Sept. 11, Evans said. That includes 57 uniformed military technicians currently deployed around the world. 
Since the Sept. 11 attacks, more than 700 uniformed military technicians in Florida have been deployed, he said, many of them multiple times. Of the 18 Florida guard members who have died supporting an overseas federal mission, two were technicians on active duty orders. 
Our ruling 
Scott said ""The FL Guard has defended our freedom in Afghanistan, Iraq, and put their lives at risk; now the fed govt is going to cut their pay 20%."" 
Scott’s statement isn’t telling the whole story. A reader could falsely assume the entire Florida Guard is furloughed. But the furloughs only affect about 8 percent of the overall Florida National Guard, or about half of the full-time force. Also, the 20 percent pay cut is not annual or permanent; they are losing that amount for one-third of the year. 
Additionally, not every furloughed civilian employee has served in Afghanistan or Iraq. Among the 966 guard members being furloughed, about 40 percent have been deployed. 
Scott’s claim contains some elements of truth: Many Guard members have risked their lives in overseas deployments and now some face pay cuts for part of the year. But the details that Scott omitted are important for understanding the full effect of the furloughs.

Roger Williams: Obama policies contributed to raising gas prices from $1.89 in 2009 to $3.51 today
","U.S. Rep. Roger Williams, R-Austin, said in a recent newsletter to constituents in his District 25 that Washington is making it harder to produce home-grown energy. A reader wrote us July 1, 2013, asking us to check this claim: ""In January of 2009, a gallon of gasoline cost $1.89. Today, the average cost of a gallon of gasoline is $3.51,"" Williams wrote in the mailer. ""It doesn’t take an economist to figure out how a gallon of gasoline has increased by $1.62 in four years. The liberal anti-free market policies of the Obama administration discourage the exploration of American sources of energy and hinder production and job growth."" This is a popular theme; we fact-checked Texas Republicans who blamed high gas prices on Obama in 2011 and 2012. Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst earned a Mostly False rating last year for claiming a gallon cost $4.50, and Michael Williams, now the state education commissioner, got a Half True for saying in 2011 that gas prices had gone up $2 under Obama. Experts told us it’s hard to pin such prices on a president. The national and state-level PolitiFact operations have checked numerous gas-price claims and are fairly consistent in saying presidents can’t correctly be praised or blamed for what you pay at the pump; world gas prices and many other factors are beyond their control. Graves emailed us historical gas-price data from the federal Energy Information Administration; we also collected data from Gasbuddy.com, which says it collects information from its website and app users, credit card transactions and gas stations, as well as from AAA, a federation of motorist clubs that according to aaa.com surveys U.S. self-serve gas stations for prices. We were unable to get precise detail on what type of gas and which calendar dates the newsletter referred to. To cover the bases, we looked at prices at the end of December 2008, the month of January 2009 and the end of April 2013 (to be certain the information would have been available for an article written in May). The energy agency had data for several types of gas, so we collected their prices for regular gas and for an average of all grades and formulations. Gasbuddy and AAA only had statistics for regular gas. Any way we measured, Williams’ comparison held up or got stronger. According to the three sources, regular gas at the end of December 2008 cost between $1.61 and $1.64 and regular gas at the end of April 2013 cost between $3.50 (a penny less than Williams said) and $3.52. The energy agency data showed all grades/all formulations averaged $1.67 a gallon at the end of December 2008 and $3.59 at the end of April 2013. Williams’ claim had gas jumping $1.62. In the datasets we looked at, gas rose at least $1.87 and at most $1.92. (Gasbuddy, which ranks Austin gas stations’ lowest prices daily at www.austingasprices.com, showed a similar jump in Texas and Austin regular gas, though generally Texas prices ran a dime or more below national prices and Austin’s prices ran 6 cents to 9 cents below Texas around those dates.) So the congressman’s estimate seems correct -- even conservative. But were liberal policies to blame for the increase? AAA and Gasbuddy spokesmen and a former Houston Chronicle journalist who covered business, including the oil and gas industry, told us that presidents have little sway over gas prices. All three said the biggest reason for the $2 jump during Williams’ timeframe was that gas prices -- along with other commodities and, indeed, the global economy -- crashed just before Obama took office. A decade of gas prices, from Gasbuddy.com   Weekly U.S. prices for a gallon of regular gasoline.  
Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at Gasbuddy, laid out key dates: With the U.S. economy starting to falter, regular gas hit an all-time high of $4.12 on July 15, 2008. Mega-investment bank Lehman Bros. filed for bankruptcy Sept. 15, 2008, triggering global financial crisis. Gas prices took their biggest drop in history, bottoming out at $1.61 on Dec. 31, 2008. Obama was sworn in Jan. 20, 2009. ""Without a recession,"" DeHaan told us by phone, ""gas prices would probably not have gotten to that low before Obama took office."" Politicians’ failure to mention the crash in such comparisons is a ""glaring omission,"" he said. ""It just so happened that the timing was not in Obama’s favor."" Prices were going up in the 2000s before the collapse, AAA spokesman Michael Green told us by phone, ""primarily due to the strengthening economy in China. As China demanded more petroleum products, it created increased demand around the world and we saw the global price of petroleum increase."" Future prices could drop with increasing North American production, said Loren Steffy, a longtime business journalist who wrote a book on 2010’s BP oil rig disaster in the Gulf. But, he said via email, ""I still believe global demand will surpass supply in the long term, so prices will continue to rise over time."" Global crude oil prices, seasonal demand from U.S. drivers and hurricanes all affect what Americans pay at the pump. DeHaan said that refineries have significant annual effects when they conduct maintenance in spring and October and and sell inventory at the end of the year for tax purposes. So would the president have been able to keep prices from rising as much by altering the policies Williams mentioned? Obama has long faced Republican criticism for keeping oil reserves in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Reserve off limits, restricting some drilling off Alaska’s shore and in the Gulf of Mexico and rejecting the proposed Keystone XL pipeline expansion that would connect Canadian oil to Texas refineries. But U.S. oil production has increased dramatically in the past three years, and as we’ve seen, U.S. gas prices still rose overall. The big U.S. production increases, Green said, have been in North Dakota and Texas shale rock formations that technology has made more accessible. Texas production more than doubled and North Dakota’s nearly tripled in those three years, he said. ""But you have to keep in mind that oil is sold on a global market. So if less oil is being produced somewhere else, then you’re still seeing the same amount of oil being produced in the world and the global price sort of remains unchanged,"" Green said. ""And we have seen some indications that places in the Middle East or Venezuela are not producing as much oil as they did in the past."" Steffy said, ""Offshore Alaska is expensive, a huge technological challenge and decades away from production. The Gulf of Mexico is pretty lucrative, but"" it might not have a big effect on world supply. ""You could open ANWR and you could push ahead with offshore Alaska, but it would be years or decades before they entered production. So the short-term effect on gas prices would be zero, and the long term would be negligible because while the supply is important from a U.S. standpoint, prices are determined globally and there won't be enough production there to meaningfully lower prices on a global scale."" DeHaan offered similar views, saying, ""Alaska doesn’t really matter. Alaska was a gusher a hundred years ago"" and Gulf production volume isn’t enough to have a big effect. ""If the president is limiting new production in the Gulf, that’s probably having some impact, but I would say it’s only a few dollars a barrel,"" he said. ""In the grand scheme of things, that’s not your smoking gun."" On Jan. 18, 2012, Obama rejected TransCanada Corp.’s request to build the northern part of the Keystone XL Pipeline extension, from Canada to Nebraska. TransCanada put in a new application now being weighed by the State Department and went ahead with the Texas segment of Keystone XL, which didn’t require presidential permission because it doesn’t cross a U.S. border; it runs from Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast refineries and is nearly complete. Green said it’s difficult to tell what impact presidential approval would have made, but said, ""You would not have seen a dramatic change in gas prices"" because ""Keystone would be one pipeline of many."" Those other pipelines include the existing Keystone pipe from Canada to Oklahoma, completed in 2011, and Canadian firm Enbridge’s pipeline system, which a July 18, 2013, Reuters news story called ""the single largest source of U.S. oil imports."" DeHaan speculated that the Keystone XL extension could actually raise gas prices in the U.S. by giving Canada access to Houston’s ports and thus the world market (Canadian oil prices having been relatively low because its supplies were more or less ""landlocked""). Steffy didn’t view that as a big risk, but said he thought Keystone’s biggest effect would be on energy security rather than prices. ""The benefit to the U.S. is that we get a steady supply from our strongest ally,"" he said. ""Better Canada than Venezuela."" Our ruling Williams said Obama policies caused gas prices to rise from $1.89 in 2009 to $3.51 today. He’s got the prices correct, but experts say presidents don’t generally have the ability to make them rise or fall and didn’t see that reversing Alaska, Gulf or Keystone policies would have necessarily kept prices from rising as much. But the big problem with ascribing this specific jump to Obama is the failure to point out that prices collapsed right before he took office. Leaving out the economy’s epic, history-making collapse might ordinarily earn such a claim a Pants on Fire rating. Because Williams cited prices accurately, we’ll rate his claim as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/jul/23/roger-williams/says-obama-policies-contributed-raising-gas-prices/

Michele Bachmann says Barack Obama can use executive order to give voting rights to illegal immigrants legalized under Senate bill
","
She may not be running for another term in Congress, but Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., is still making provocative statements. 
In an interview with World Net Daily, a conservative Web publication, Bachmann urged House Republicans to oppose key features of a Senate-passed bill that allows a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants (a process that critics call amnesty). 
Among other things, she warned that as soon as illegal immigrants become voters, they will vote for Democrats. Bachmann said that Republicans could lose the House in 2014 if they weren’t careful. 
""Because, I think the president, even by executive order, could again wave his magic wand before 2014 and he’d say, ‘Now, all of the new legal Americans are going to have voting rights,’ "" Bachmann said. 
Bachmann’s office didn’t return a request for elaboration, but we found several legal experts to analyze her claim that Obama, or any president, could use an executive order to grant voting rights to anyone newly legalized under an immigration overhaul that emerges from Congress. 
The short answer is that Bachmann is wrong. 
The Constitution explicitly addresses who can vote for the U.S. House of Representatives (Article I, Section 2), for the U.S. Senate (the 12th Amendment) and for the presidency (Article II, Section 1). In each case, the Constitution says, the states -- not the president or Congress -- determines who can vote for these offices. To vote for Congress, for instance, a voter must be eligible to vote for representatives to the larger house of the state’s legislature. 
Because of this, ""the president can’t change the federal qualification directly, and he also could not, by executive order, change the qualifications for the state legislature,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Generally speaking, only native-born or naturalized citizens can vote. Legal permanent residents (those with a green card) cannot. Once someone becomes a legal permanent resident, they generally have to wait five years before they are even eligible to seek U.S. citizenship. If they decide to apply for citizenship, they must pass a criminal background check and a civics test before becoming a citizen. 
In fact, a law passed in 1996 and amended in 2000, says clearly that it’s ""unlawful for any alien to vote"" in a federal election. 
""Any non-citizen who attempts to vote unlawfully is subject to criminal penalty under state and federal law,"" said Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California-Davis School of Law.  
The Senate immigration bill would not grant voting rights to newly legalized immigrants immediately, and they would not be guaranteed the right to vote eventually. Rather, the bill sets up a pathway to citizenship -- a pathway that includes additional hurdles beyond the ones facing legal permanent residents seeking naturalization, such as paying a fine. 
Once the law is enacted, Obama wouldn’t be able to do a quick about-face and use an executive order to strip out all the obstacles to citizenship and simply make illegal immigrants full citizens, Roosevelt and Johnson agreed. ""It would violate the intent of, as well as the text of, the law passed by Congress,"" Johnson said. 
Indeed, Obama has not demonstrated an inclination to push the envelope on changing voting rules for illegal immigrants. Under an Obama administration policy known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children can seek a delay from deportation, as well as permission to work legally. But the right to vote is not allowed under the policy. 
So, Bachmann is flat wrong about Obama’s ability to turn illegal immigrants into voters. However, as we have sometimes noted, even her incorrect statements raise some interesting questions. As it turns out, Obama can’t issue an executive order that allows non-citizens to vote, but states may be able to extend voting rights to non-citizens, as long as doing so is not barred by the state’s constitution. 
As recently as this year, the Supreme Court ruled in Arizona vs. Inter-Tribal Council of Arizona that the Constitution ""empowers Congress to regulate how federal elections are held, but not who may vote in them"" -- which only strengthens a state’s claim to the power to decide who can vote. 
""I think a state would have a strong argument"" that it could do this, Roosevelt said. 
Of course, just because it’s possible doesn’t mean it’s likely. Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation and a former member of the Federal Election Commission, said states that try to allow non-citizens to vote would likely face a court fight. ""They would have to pass a state law, and then go to court and argue that the state law is not pre-empted by the federal statute and that the federal law is an unconstitutional invasion of the state’s right to set qualifications,"" he said. 
In general, states might have an easier time arguing that non-citizens should be permitted to vote in state elections. A state that sought to permit non-citizen voting in federal elections would face greater legal obstacles, experts say. 
However, an even higher hurdle would be overcoming the idea, now deeply ingrained in the public mind, that there’s a bright line between citizens and non-citizens -- citizens vote, and non-citizens do not. 
Today, very few non-citizens vote for any office, and the few who do only vote for local offices. For instance, non-citizens can vote in a handful of localities in Maryland, such as Takoma Park, and only for purely local positions. No state today allows non-citizens to vote in state-level elections, and the occasional efforts in state legislatures to expand voting to non-citizens have gone nowhere. 
This was not always the case. Alien voting was permitted in many states early in the nation’s history, and while the idea waxed and waned over the years, the impulse to let aliens vote spread widely during westward expansion, when new territories were eager to attract residents, political scientist Jamin Raskin has written. 
Such laws were reversed one by one during the first quarter of the 20th Century, due to World War I-era nationalism and fears about rising immigrant populations. The last state to allow alien voting, Arkansas, ended it in 1926. No state has resurrected it since. 
Our ruling 
Bachmann said ""the president … by executive order"" could grant voting rights to illegal immigrants newly legalized under pending legislation. That’s not true -- the states, not the president, have the power to determine who can vote. It’s right there in the Constitution.

Errant email on health care law comes to Georgia
","
There’s been a lot of confusion and controversy surrounding the federal health care law, otherwise known as Obamacare. 
And now there’s an email being circulated that is adding to the turmoil. 
Gwinnett County resident Don Smith shared the email with us and asked if it was accurate. 
The email contained a photo of a receipt from Cabela’s, a Nebraska-based retail store that sells sporting goods, guns and camping gear. Cabela’s is not in Georgia. Underlined in yellow on the receipt is the amount charged for a ""medical excise tax."" 
""The 2.3 (percent) Medical Excise Tax that began on January 1st is supposed to be ‘hidden’ from the consumer, but it’s been brought to the public’s attention by hunting and fishing store Cabela’s who have refused to hide it and are showing it as a separate line item tax on their receipts,"" the email says. 
The email says it went on the Internal Revenue Service’s website and did some research. 
""And what do I find under ‘MEDICAL DEVICES’ under ‘MANUFACTURERS TAXES?,’ "" The following discussion of manufacturers taxes applies to the tax on: Sport fishing equipment; Fishing rods and fishing poles; Electric outboard motors; Fishing tackle boxes; Bows, quivers, broadheads and points; Arrow shafts; Coal; Taxable tires; Gas guzzler automobiles; and Vaccines.""  
Our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio recently examined a similar email and determined anyone who gets it in their inbox should put it in their trash bin. 
First, though, it is true that there is a medical device excise tax. The tax is designed to offset the added costs of expanding health coverage to the uninsured, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It became law at the beginning of this year. A 2.3 percent tax is imposed on some devices. 
The federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act has broad definitions of the types of devices that can be taxed. They’re typically devices used by physicians or medical offices. The items that cannot be taxed include eyeglasses, contact lenses and hearing aids. PolitiFact Ohio found that none of the items listed in the chain email are included as medical devices. 
So why would Cabela’s tax its customers? It was an error, the business told PolitiFact Ohio. 
A Cabela's spokesman blamed a companywide ""glitch"" in its sales register system. The problem added a 2.3 percent ""medical excise tax"" to all purchases at its stores on Jan. 1. The error was caught the same day, the spokesman said, and the charges would be refunded. 
Is the tax ""hidden""? Obviously not, if it was included on the Cabela’s bill. The Medical Device Manufacturers Association, a Washington, D.C.-based group, has vigorously lobbied against the tax and supported congressional bills to repeal it, saying it will take money the industry uses for research and development. In a March press release, the association said manufacturers had paid $388 million in taxes to the federal government since the tax started in January. 
To sum up, the email claims a medical excise tax ""is supposed to be hidden from the consumer."" That’s incorrect. The email also implies that items that can be taxed include fishing rods and some cars. Again, incorrect. Lastly, the email says Cabela’s sporting goods store ""refused to hide"" the tax. Wrong. The company said it made a mistake when it taxed customers and would refund them.

Obama has had 1,540 nominations confirmed and only 4 defeated, says McConnell
","
The long-running Senate battle between Democrats and Republicans over the filibuster and delays in processing President Barack Obama’s nominations came to the brink this past week. 
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., threatened to use the so-called nuclear option and set aside the 60-vote majority needed to close debate and bring a nomination to the floor. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said if Reid did that, he was ""going to be remembered as the worst leader of the Senate ever."" 
The two sides healed the breach after many urgent phone calls and a meeting of every senator in the Old Senate Chamber, a room one lawmaker called ""hallowed ground."" 
But before the return to relative civility, McConnell had been on NBC’s Meet the Press where he argued that the president had done pretty well for himself. ""What is the problem here?"" McConnell asked. ""The president has had 1,540 of his nominations confirmed, only four defeated."" 
McConnell’s office said he meant to say 1,560. We checked, and he did use the correct number just three days earlier. We also looked at the Library of Congress nominations database for Obama’s first and second terms and confirmed McConnell’s numbers. 
But what drew our attention was McConnell’s claim that only four had been defeated. That number refers to people who failed on a measure to end debate (called ""cloture) and send their names to the floor for a simple majority vote. It takes 60 votes to end debate. 
McConnell’s list includes Craig Becker (National Labor Relations Board), Caitlin Joan Halligan (U.S. Circuit judge), Goodwin Liu (U.S. Circuit judge), and Richard Cordray (director, Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection). 
However, that doesn’t account for many of the people Obama put forward who have withdrawn due to opposition from Senate Republicans. 
""McConnell is using misleading numbers,"" said Ian Ostrander, a political scientist at Texas Tech University. ""He’s taking advantage of the fact that very few nominations actually fail through a direct vote."" 
There are many ways to stymie a nomination. There is the threat of filibuster which requires clearing the 60-vote majority to end debate. 
Alternatively, opponents can run out the clock and return the nomination to the White House with no vote at all, generally right before the summer recess or at the end of the year. 
Or an individual senator, anonymously or publicly, can place a hold and block a nomination from moving forward. 
Ostrander said that the White House might withdraw a nomination, or never put someone’s name forward if minority opposition seems too strong. He cited the examples of Susan Rice, Obama’s first choice for Secretary of State, and Elizabeth Warren, his first pick to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Neither was ever formally nominated. 
Republicans didn’t like key aspects of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the first place. In May 2011, 44 GOP senators sent a letter to the administration saying they ""will not support the consideration of any nominee, regardless of party affiliation"" until changes were made. When Obama replaced Warren with Richard Cordray, it made no difference in the Republican position. 
Cordray was the first stalled nominee to win confirmation immediately after the deal that averted the crisis in the Senate. 
Occasionally, Ostrander said, the nominee on their own steps back due to long delays. He put Federal Reserve Board nominee Peter Diamond in this category. Diamond, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, was nominated three times. Twice in 2010, the Senate did not reject him; it simply made no decision and returned the nomination to the White House. 
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., worked hard against the nomination and never backed down. The White House nominated Diamond a third time in June 2011, but he withdrew saying he saw that his name would never make it to the Senate floor. 
Ostrander has studied more than two decades of non-judicial nominations. His doctoral thesis: Winning the Waiting Game: Senatorial Delay in Executive Nominations. 
Ostrander has detailed at what point nominations failed in the nomination process: 84 percent stalled or were withdrawn before going before a committee. Another 0.03 percent were rejected by a committee vote, while 0.01 percent were rejected in a floor vote. 
""McConnell is choosing to count as failures cases that only account for a small fraction of overall failures,"" Ostrander said. 
Overall, 69 of Obama’s nominees withdrew for any reason since 2009. During the first term, Ostrander said he counts 38 who likely pulled out under pressure from Republican opposition. 
We reviewed in detail 12 instances (beyond McConnell’s four) where nominees withdrew after encountering opposition, either to their specific background or to Obama’s policies. Those include Donald Berwick to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Erroll Southers to lead for the Transportation Security Administration, Michael Mundaca for the Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Policy, and Dawn Johnsen to be assistant attorney general, among others.   
There is an additional issue with McConnell’s measure of Obama’s success rate. We contacted five other political scientists, and they agreed that McConnell’s statement overlooked the impact of delayed nominations even if they ultimately win confirmation. 
In the book Defending the Filibuster: The Soul of the Senate, Richard A. Arenberg and Robert B. Dove said the filibuster is a moderating force and a check on executive power. We asked Arenberg if McConnell’s point about the president’s track record on confirmations was valid. 
""Clearly, it's not only the final outcome that matters,"" Arenberg said. ""Delay in confirmation can certainly hamper an executive agency."" 
Michael Gerhardt, a law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, has studied the nomination process. ""The problem is not just the delays; it is the limited authority of an acting or temporary head,"" Gerhardt said. ""Here, the statistics might not accurately capture the harm done to the executive branch."" 
Our ruling 
McConnell said Obama faced no real problems getting his nominees confirmed by the Senate, saying that only four of 1,540 nominations had been defeated. His office later said he misspoke and the number should have been 1,560. 
We find he's partially accurate but is leaving out some important details. Yes, it's true that when nominations reach a final vote, the vast majority have been approved by the Senate. But this accounting ignores those who withdrew before a vote, including the estimated 38 who withdrew after Republican opposition. It also does not account for high-profile figures such as Susan Rice who were never nominated because of opposition.

New tests could take up 20 school days, say Will Weatherford and Don Gaetz
","
Florida is in the midst of implementing new, tougher academic standards to make its students more internationally competitive. To do that, the state needs to replace the well-known FCAT exam with a new set of tests. 
As the 2014-15 deadline approaches, though, questions are being raised about whether the new testing system, called PARCC, is the best choice. 
On July 17, Florida’s top lawmakers weighed in with a resounding ""no."" 
House Speaker Will Weatherford and Senate President Don Gaetz sent a two-page letter to education commissioner Tony Bennett urging him to withdraw from PARCC (the acronym stands for Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers) and instead craft a ""Florida plan"" for testing. They listed five key reasons, including cost, technology requirements and time spent testing. 
(We can only rate one person on our Truth-O-Meter, so we're rating Weatherford, but the ruling applies to both.) 
To that last point, they pointedly wrote, ""According to information provided recently through PARCC and earlier by the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE), the complete PARCC assessments will consume approximately twenty days of testing for elementary, middle and high school students."" 
That figure -- 20 days of testing -- puzzled some readers of the letter, which the lawmakers circulated widely. Were students going to be tested for a full 20 days? 
In fact, the leaders were on the mark — if not a bit conservative — to folks well versed in the language of high-stakes testing. 
But the number makes sense only if you understand that schools are given a window to test students. The current FCAT, for example, takes 12 days for schools to administer. 
It’s important to understand the broader context of this debate, too: The new testing system is meant to complement the Common Core State Standards, which have become increasingly debated across the country. 
Advocates like Bill Gates, Jeb Bush and the Obama administration say the system will create higher expectations for students and provide more rigor to propel them ahead. An odd combination of teacher unions and tea party activists, meanwhile, are pushing for states to abandon the model. 
The unions say that teachers and schools are not prepared for the change, while the tea party groups argue against a nationalized curriculum and testing. 
Setting that debate aside, it’s important to know that school testing is not typically a one-day thing for students or teachers. 
A Florida fourth-grader currently spends about 5 hours 40 minutes over four days taking FCAT exams in reading, math and writing, for instance, according to a state analysis. That same student would sit for 9 hours 20 minutes of PARCC year-end testing, over six to nine days.  
PARCC also would have mid-year testing, also with a 20-day window to get them all completed. And, the PARCC estimate does not include what the Florida DOE listed as ""a set amount of additional time yet to be determined. ...This may in turn also increase the number of testing days."" 
The days-long testing windows give schools time to cycle children through the computerized portions of the tests. Many schools do not have enough machines or bandwidth to test all children at the same time. 
That gives credence to the leaders’ choice of the word ""consume"" when writing about what tests do to the school day. Even under FCAT, many teachers have observed that testing season takes over school classrooms and computer labs. 
Gaetz and Weatherford are not alone in their concerns. 
Oklahoma state superintendent Janet Barresi, a Republican who had her state join PARCC as one of her first actions in office, three weeks ago announced she would abandon the tests. 
Like Weatherford and Gaetz, Barresi cited increased testing time as one of her key concerns. Oklahoma fourth-graders currently take only two hours of state tests. 
""We just felt like that’s a significant leap,"" department spokeswoman Tricia Pemberton told PolitiFact. ""We do want the increased rigor of a PARCC-type exam … but we just want to do a little less of that at this point."" 
Commissioner Bennett has been evaluating PARCC, along with other testing options for Florida that he could go with. He has said he will take the lawmakers’ concerns into consideration as he makes his recommendation. 
Our ruling 
In a letter to the state education commissioner, Gaetz and Weatherford said they were concerned that new standards would increase test-taking time for Florida’s students, describing the PARCC standards as ""consuming"" 20 days for elementary, middle and high school students. 
The word ""consuming"" implies that those days will be taken up completely by testing. That’s not the case for students, who will not be tested continuously for 20 days. 
But it’s on the mark for schools, which would have a 20-day window in which to administer tests to different students within the school. In fact, schools generally expect to focus on little else besides testing procedures for that time period. The current FCAT tests work the same way, but that testing window is shorter, at 12 days.

Democrats say Cuccinelli questions whether Social Security, Medicare should exist
","Democrats have been flipping through Republican gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli’s book ""The Last Line of Defense"" in a bid to paint him as conservative extremist. The latest citation from the 2013 book comes from the Democratic Party of Virginia, which is airing a TV ad with Peggy Borgard, a Henrico County senior citizen, criticizing Cuccinelli’s views on entitlement programs.   ""In his book, Cuccinelli questions whether Medicare and Social Security should exist and said people are dependent on government,"" Borgard says. It seemed remarkable that any candidate would start an election year by writing a book questioning propriety of popular entitlement programs for senior citizens. That goes double for a gubernatorial candidate who, if elected, would have no influence over how the federal government runs Medicare and Social Security. So we looked into the Democrat’s claim. On screen, the ad cites as its source page 62 of the book. At the bottom of that page is a passage that has been a lightning rod for Democrats. ""Sometimes bad politicians set out to grow government in order to increase their own power and influence,"" Cuccinelli wrote. This phenomenon doesn’t just happen in Washington; it happens at all levels of government. The amazing thing is that they often grow government without protest from citizens, and sometimes they even get buy-in from citizens -- at least from the ones getting the goodies."" Cuccinelli then cites specific entitlements. ""One of their favorite ways to increase their power is by creating programs that dispense subsidized government benefits, such as Medicare, Social Security and outright welfare (Medicaid, food stamps, subsidized housing and the like). These programs make people dependent on government. And once people are dependent, they feel they can’t afford to have the programs taken away, no matter how inefficient, poorly run or costly to the rest of society."" That’s certainly not a ringing endorsement of the entitlement programs, which the Republican said are a tool leveraged by politicians to hold on to power. But does that mean Cuccinelli questions whether those entitlements should exist at all? Cuccinelli answered that question on pages 237 and 238, as first noted by our colleagues at FactCheck.org. Cuccinelli wrote that government spends little on investments that result in economic growth, noting that Social Security, Medicare and defense spending amounted to more than half of the federal budget in 2011. ""There is no monetary return on these investments in any traditional business sense (that is, one invests money with a goal of getting a return in the form of interest, income or appreciation in value), although there are obviously other reasons America spends money on these programs,"" Cuccinelli wrote. ""I’m not questioning here the existence of these programs nor the wisdom of how much money is spent on them. What I’m trying to illustrate is that most dollars that government spends do not create economic growth, but instead take money out of the hands of the people who do create economic growth."" Again, Cuccinelli wrote, ""I’m not questioning here the existence of these programs, nor how much money is spent on them."" And on pages 74 and 75, Cuccinelli wrote Medicare and Social Security are indeed constitutional programs based on the government’s tax and spending authority. After the ad appeared, Cuccinelli issued a statement saying, ""I have always believed programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security are government services that should be maintained."" Cuccinelli added that the social safety net programs should be ""reformed"" so they can be preserved for future generations. Brian Coy, spokesman for the Democratic Party of Virginia, stood by the ad’s statement. ""On page 62 in the book he describes Social Security and Medicare as created by ‘bad politicians’ who ‘set out to grow government in order to increase their own power and influence,’"" Coy wrote in an e-mail. ""That statement clearly questions  the foundations of those programs - why would he say they’re a big government ploy by bad politicians without questioning their existence?"" Coy also defended the statement by pointing to a Cuccinelli interview with Politichicks.tv at a 2012 Tea Party rally. Cuccinelli said, ""We have had one answer in federal government to every challenge in health care for 47 years, and that’s more government. It goes back to the beginning of Medicaid, Medicare and as Dr. Phil would say ‘How’s that working out for ya?’ We need to go the other way. We need to move back toward the free market."" The Fact Checker at The Washington Post recently gave the ad three out of four possible Pinocchios, saying ""while it is fair to say that Cuccinelli is skeptical of government-run social programs"" and that he prefers free market solutions as part of any overhaul of those entitlements, that doesn’t mean he thinks that the programs should not exist. FactCheck.org found that the ad ""goes too far."" Finally, let’s return to Peggy Borgard, the senior citizen who narrated the ad. We left two messages for her and did not hear back. Borgard retired last year as administrator of a youth soccer league. She has contributed $1,770  to Democratic candidates and nothing to Republicans since 2004, according to data from the Virginia Public Access Project. Our ruling The Democratic Party of Virginia says in a new ad that Cuccinelli, in his book, ""questions whether Medicare and Social Security should exist."" Cuccinelli gave the Democrats a tiny opening in writing that ""bad politicians"" have ""tried to increase their power by creating programs that dispense subsidized government benefits, such as Medicare, Social Security"" that make people ""dependent on government."" But ad goes overboard because it suggests Cuccinelli is questioning whether the entitlements should exist today and in the future. Cuccinelli specifically wrote in his book, ""I am not questioning the existence of these programs, nor how much is spent on them."" The Democrats ignored that key passage and we rate their claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/jul/22/democratic-party-virginia/democrats-says-cuccinelli-whether-social-security-/

Christine O'Donnell says she hasn't run a negative ad
","
The day after their nationally televised debate on CNN, Democrat Chris Coons and Republican Christine O'Donnell -- two candidates vying for an open Senate seat in Delaware -- faced off in a second live debate at a Wilmington Rotary Club meeting.

During that Oct. 14, 2010, event, a questioner asked both candidates, ""What qualities do you most respect and admire in your opponent?""

Coons responded first, praising the civil tone of the debate, adding that O'Donnell had shown ""remarkable persistence"" and ""passionate commitment"" to the conservative cause.

Then it was O'Donnell's turn.

""I do respect my opponent in his ability to debate and his ability to thoughtfully answer a question,"" she said. ""So I respect him, I respect him for standing up on the issues. But I would say that when he made the remarks about not going dirty, I do want to point out that we haven't yet taken out a negative ad. So I would ask you to stand on that pledge and ask that the negative ads, the slanderous ads against me, stop.""

When we saw the clip replayed on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, we were struck by O'Donnell's comment that ""we haven't yet taken out a negative ad,"" given that we had spent the better part of a day dissecting an ad from O'Donnell that all but portrayed Coons as the protagonist in a horror movie.

The minute-long ad, featuring dark visuals and spooky music, portrays Coons -- the county executive of Delaware's populous New Castle County -- as a roving psychopath that she dubs ""The Taxman."" Coons, the narrator intones, ""is taxing everything out here.""

The ad -- along with an explanatory website that uses similar visuals -- was unveiled on Oct. 11, at which point it gained wide media attention due to the public fascination with the race. (O'Donnell, a tea party favorite, had come from behind in the GOP primary to beat a long-serving establishment Republican, Mike Castle, turning a likely Republican seat into a likely Democratic seat.) PolitiFact weighed in on two parts of the ""TaxMan"" ad on Oct. 13 -- a full day before O'Donnell's reference to not taking out negative ads in the debate.

So it seemed pretty obvious to us that O'Donnell was wrong. The ""TaxMan"" ad was ""paid for and authorized by"" Friends of Christine O'Donnell, which by all indications is an offshoot of her campaign. On O'Donnell's campaign website, the ""Donate Now"" page says it was paid for by Friends of Christine O'Donnell. And Friends of Christine O'Donnell was also the sponsor of her famous ""I'm You"" ad.

So when O'Donnell said that ""we haven't yet taken out a negative ad,"" she was wrong -- and had been wrong for at least two full days. We don't necessarily think negative ads are inherently bad; campaigns are about contrasting one candidate to another, so negative ads can play a valuable role, as long as they're accurate. We're not knocking O'Donnell's use of a negative ad here; we're knocking her decision to use a negative ad and then deny that she did. We rate her claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/oct/18/christine-odonnell/christine-odonnell-says-she-hasnt-run-negative-ad/

Rob Portman uses old stats to rap Lee Fisher on job training
","
Apples and oranges? Apples and papayas? We’re running a little short on fruit here, though a guava sounds about right when considering a claim that U.S. Senate candidate Rob Portman made during a debate with Lee Fisher on Oct. 4.

About 10 minutes into the debate in Toledo, the questions turned to foreign trade. Joe Hallett of the Columbus Dispatch, one of the panelists, asked Portman  about the government’s responsibility to workers who have lost their jobs due to  trade.

Portman, a Republican who served as President George W. Bush’s trade ambassador, talked briefly about needing to ""level that playing field"" and expand exports. Then he added:

""I agree with what Joe Hallett just said. Sometimes trade has a disruptive effect and we need to be sure that we are minimizing that. But when it happens, we need to be sure that the government steps in and provides workers the retraining that they need. This is why I'm not just a strong supporter of the current trade adjustment assistance of helping workers, but I'm for revamping and reforming the system. Under Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher, Ohio is 44th in the country in terms of getting money actually into worker retraining. Over $3 billion a year comes into Ohio from the federal government. That money is not well spent.""

That figure -- 44th in the country -- had never been cited this way, meeting PolitiFact’s standard precisely: It made us say, ""Really?""

So we asked about it, got the study that Portman drew his figure from, and talked with experts. And this is where the apples, oranges, guavas and fresh berries turned into a mixed fruit salad.

Portman’s campaign says the figure came from an April 2010 report titled, ""Help Wanted: A lead state workforce official."" It was put out by Community Research Partners, a nonprofit Columbus organization whose donors include the city of Columbus, Franklin County, the United Way of Central Ohio and the Joyce Foundation. It’s worth noting that the 35-page report was not about the retraining needs of workers after companies shift operations overseas. Rather, it was about the much broader universe of workforce development in Ohio and the desire to create a workforce with 21st century skills.

Ohio’s ""complex and decentralized workforce system"" presents challenges to that goal, the report said. The system was designed to give tremendous authority to local agencies and state one-stop career centers, who in theory best understand their communities’ needs. But Ohio needs a strong central leader to tie together the components of job training and articulate the crucial mission, the paper’s authors concluded. They said Ohio needs a  cabinet-level, highly respected, credible jobs czar.

Many subjects came up in support of this proposal, including the way the state uses Workforce Investment Act, or WIA,  funds. Congress approved the WIA in 1998 as a primary federal funding mechanism for worker training. Portman’s statistic came from a paragraph in the report that cited WIA. It said:

""In program year 2006-2007 (the most recent period for comparative data), Ohio reported that 16.4 percent of unemployed WIA adult program exiters received an Individual Training Account, ranking Ohio 44th nationally.""

Individual training accounts are like vouchers that can be used for training or classes for high-demand jobs. They are just one of many ways the state provides help for the jobless, but an important way.

But if Ohio ranked 44th in getting out the training account money in 2006-2007, it seems only fair to ask how the state ranks now.

No one knows. There has been no subsequent comparison. That was among the reasons that representatives of Community Research Partners and the Ohio Department of Job and Family services quibbled with Portman’s statistic when we called to ask them. One could also quibble about the sum of money Portman mentioned -- $3 billion annually ""from the federal government"" -- because that’s the total of all money available to Ohio for job training, and it includes state money for universities and community colleges, according to Roberta Garber, executive director of Community Research Partners.

Finally, Portman was asked about trade but included figures covering a much broader subject, although it is unlikely that anyone other than a job-training wonk even noticed. Was he mixing apples with oranges?

While at first blush it appeared so, we are convinced after reviewing his campaign materials that he has been interested in that much broader subject -- all job training, including the Workforce Investment Act -- for some time.

But what of his answer’s central criticism of his opponent Fisher, and the blame he placed on Fisher for the state’s ranking?

The figure cames from a 12-month period  that started in July 2006. Fisher had not even been elected then. And since the program year ended in June 2007, Fisher was in office for just half the year whose bad performance was cited.

The state subsequently made changes in job training, and by 2009, 24.2 percent of unemployed adults in Ohio’s WIA programs had individual training accounts by the time they left, according to ODJFS spokesman Ben Johnson, who added that the training represents only one of many tools available under WIA.  If you counted all training for all WIA customers and not just that covered by individual accounts,  the figure rose to 48 percent in the 2009 program year, Johnson said..

This is not intended to be an evaluation of how far the state has come or whether Ohio needs a cabinet-level jobs leader. It is merely an assessment of Portman’s claim: ""Under Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher, Ohio is 44th in the country in terms of getting money actually into worker retraining.
  
In using the figure to blast Fisher, then, you could say that Portman mixed apples and kumquats. That’s why we rate Portman’s claim False.

Dan Gelber claims Pam Bondi told lobbyists she'll side with corporate special interests
","
In the final month of this long election season, state attorney general candidate Dan Gelber starts his first general election TV ad entitled ""Epidemic"" by stating the obvious: ""Public corruption -- it’s an epidemic in Florida.""  

Given the recent string of public corruption arrests throughout the state -- from school board members gone awry in Broward County to a Florida Department of Law Enforcement probe into Republican Party of Florida spending -- there’s hardly an argument there.

But, as the 30-second commercial continues, Gelber makes the following claim against his Republican challenger: ""Pam Bondi told a group of lobbyists she’ll side with corporate special interests as attorney general. That’s why they’re funding her campaign.""

He then goes on to tout his experience saying: ""I’m Dan Gelber, as a federal prosecutor I helped put away corporate criminals, corrupt politicians and violent gangs. As attorney general I’ll prosecute corruption and public fraud in a way my opponent never will. While she protects insiders, I’ll take them on and protect what matters most.""

The statement that Bondi ""told a group of lobbyists she’ll side with corporate special interests as attorney general"" certainly sounded like quite a discussion, if it indeed took place. So we decided to take a closer look.

When we asked Gelber’s campaign to lay out the case, spokesman Christian Ulvert responded with the following arguments.

First, the campaign argues that Bondi’s comments at a fundraiser, where she sided with members of the Florida Chamber of Commerce and the Associated Industries of Florida (AIF) on the issue of union-backed card checks, establishes the fact that she a) spoke to lobbyists and b) expressed her support of and ""passed the litmus test"" on an issue important to the corporate community.

Second, Gelber’s campaign contends that Bondi has aligned herself as being more supportive of business interests by using public appearances before groups like AIF to liken Gelber to former New York governor and attorney general Eliot Spitzer. While Spitzer was forced to resign from his governor’s post following a sex scandal, as AG he aggressively went after insurance and financial firms, earning the name ""the sheriff of Wall Street.""

Gelber's argument, then, is that Bondi told business groups that she endorses a position they’ve taken and took aim at her opponent by saying he would act tough on business interests. Let’s weigh those points.

Card check

On Aug. 19, 2010, Bondi attended a fundraiser held in her honor at the home of Florida Chamber of Commerce President Steve Halverson. The event, which raised $50,000 for her campaign was also co-hosted by Ericka Alba, head of Associated Industries of Florida, a group that lobbies before the state Legislature on business interests.

During the event, Bondi clarified her position on the union-backed issue of ""card check,"" which is opposed by big business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Bondi said she opposed card check -- an element of the Employee Free Choice Act, proposed federal legislation that would allow unions to organize in a workplace if 50 percent of employees sign a card in public. Currently, unions can attempt to organize only under federally supervised secret-ballot elections.

Still, it's been more than a year since the Employee Free Choice Act was introduced into Congress on March 10, 2009, by its key co-sponsor, the late Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, and it has yet to come before the Senate for a full vote.

Opponents of the so-called card check, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, argue that by making the vote public, unions could strong-arm employees into checking ""yes"" for unionization.

""If there is any question in your mind, I am adamantly opposed to check card,"" Bondi told the group, as found on this Palm Beach Post video of the event. ""Everyone in this room has known from day one that I am adamantly opposed to check card. So I misspoke and I just want to make any clarification there that I need to.""

Bondi was attempting to clarify her position following a radio interview, given on Aug. 19, 2010, on WDBO-AM 580 in Central Florida,  where she seemed to tell host Tico Perez the opposite: ""With the unions, I’m totally against the secret ballot... The votes have to be public. We have to have transparency to make sure everything is on the up and up. We have to protect our businesses in this economy more than ever.""

Afterward, Halverson chimed in and further vouched for Bondi’s position to those in the room.

""Obviously, card check is virtually a litmus test,"" Halverson said. ""I can absolutely assure you that what Pam said -- that she’s been opposed to card check from the very beginning. If anybody heard that or heard comments from her desperate opponent to the contrary, rest assured that isn’t the case.""

Gelber has said in the past that he supports the Employee Free Choice Act, such as this March 2009 appearance before the Florida AFL-CIO labor union.

Regardless of how the Employee Free Choice Act plays out on the federal level, it may have little bearing on Florida because it is a ""right to work state"" -- meaning someone hired for a job where the workers have unionized cannot be required to join a union or pay union dues.

Dan Gelber = Eliot Spitzer?

Gelber’s campaign also argues that by trying to paint Gelber as a Spitzer-type AG, distancing herself from that model, Bondi is signaling to business lobbying groups like AIF that she would not be as aggressive in pursuing litigation against businesses. ""The obvious and unmistakable context of her argument is that Dan Gelber would take them on and she wouldn’t,"" Ulvert wrote in his e-mail.

""Unlike Mr. Gelber, I understand the difference between using the attorney general’s office to responsibly protect consumers vs. attacking businesses as an activist AG in the mold of Eliot Spitzer,"" Bondi told the St. Petersburg Times in an Aug. 28, 2010, article.

The article goes on to note: ""Bondi does call herself ‘extremely pro-business.’ She said Friday that’s not incompatible with protecting consumers, but voters will decide that.""

She used the Gelber and Spitzer comparison at a meet-and-greet event with the Florida Chamber of Commerce on Aug. 19, 2010, at their Tallahassee office.

""The more I hear about Dan Gelber, the more I learn, the last thing we need is an Eliot Spitzer-type attorney general,"" Bondi said at the Aug. 19, 2010, according to the St. Petersburg Times.

Gelber’s campaign also points to a questionnaire filled out by Bondi, Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottcamp and Holly Benson, when the three were competing in the August Republican primary.

All three were asked by the Republican Club of Northwest St. John’s County: ""Can the AG’s office sue to recover damages against negligent companies whose actions lead to similar disasters as the BP oil spill?""

While Benson and Kottcamp both wrote  ""Yes"" as their first response, Bondi’s response was more roundabout.

""Proactive and voluntary action by the business or industry to responsibly correct errors and compensate victims without the state intervening is in the best interest of Florida’s consumers,"" Bondi replied. ""I would encourage the exploration of every possible option.""

Still she adds: ""However, if legal action becomes necessary because a crime against the state or citizens was committed, or a business did not live up to the corrective actions necessary to appropriately compensate or correct wrongs against our state and citizens, I would aggressively seek to resolve those issues in a court of law.""

Bondi responds

Bondi’s campaign has already issued a letter to several Florida TV stations airing Gelber’s ad, asking that they stop running the ad and calling it ""misleading"" and ""deceptive.""

""He didn't express his opinion about Pam or her policies, but instead, chose to attribute to Pam a specific statement (‘I'll side with corporate special interests as Attorney General’) allegedly made to a specific audience (‘told a group of lobbyists’) with absolutely no proof,"" said Bondi campaign spokeswoman Kim Kirtley.

Our ruling

So back to the question. Did Bondi ""tell a group of lobbyists that she’ll side with corporate special interests?""

She describes herself as pro-business, and she did tell a group of lobbyists, business owners and fundraisers from AIF and the Florida Chamber of Commerce that she sided with their stance against public unionization votes. But that’s only one issue. In fact, Gelber is also on the record on that issue, with the opposite stance. We don't think that means he'll always side with unions, and we think it's too great a leap to generalize that Bondi will always side with business interests. Therefore we rate the claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/18/dan-gelber/dan-gelber-claims-pam-bondi-told-lobbyists-special/

Planned Parenthood says Scott Walker tried to pass a bill to allow pharmacists block women’s access to birth control
","
Planned Parenthood Advocates, the lobbying and political action arm of Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, says it made more than 1.1 million ""voter contacts"" in the 2008 elections.

The Madison-based group, which supports pro-choice candidates, has also been working to influence voters in 2010 -- including pushing them to support Democrat Tom Barrett in the Nov. 2, 2010 election for governor.

The group is painting Barrett’s rival, GOP nominee Scott Walker, as ""just too extreme."" In a flier mailed to voters, it frames Walker’s views this way:

""Scott Walker tried to pass a law to allow pharmacists to block women’s access to birth control.""

Is that really the case?

Planned Parenthood Advocates spokeswoman Amanda Harrington said her organization’s statement about Walker is based on Assembly Bill 168, a measure Walker sponsored in 2001 while serving in the state Assembly. It would have applied to pharmacists and other health care providers, but it did not become law.

The bill would have: 
Asked to respond to the Planned Parenthood Advocates flier, Jill Bader, spokeswoman for Walker’s gubernatorial campaign, said it was ""completely false"" that the bill had anything to do with birth control.

But news stories at the time described how Walker’s bill targeted RU-486, an abortion pill, and the ""morning-after"" pill, which prevents a pregnancy. The articles also told how the proposal could have allowed pharmacists to refuse to dispense most other forms of birth control.

""Could"" and ""most"" are the operative words.

But both Harrington and Matt Sande of Pro-Life Wisconsin say the protections for pharmacists in Walker’s bill would have applied to the dispensing of all types of birth control.

Back to the claim about Walker.

The claim does not address pills or devices, but rather how pharmacists would have been allowed to function had the bill become law.

Planned Parenthood says flatly: Pharmacists would have been able to block women from getting birth control.

In truth, the effects would have been more limited.

An individual pharmacist could have refused to fill a particular birth control prescription. But women could have gotten the prescription filled by another pharmacist, perhaps at the same counter, or at another pharmacy. In many places, that might have amounted to an inconvenience, though in areas with few pharmacies, a refusal by one pharmacist could have created a bigger burden.

As for the 2010 race, both candidates have given their views on the issue: Barrett says he opposes efforts to allow pharmacists to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions; Walker says he supports allowing pharmacists to refuse to fill emergency contraception prescriptions on moral grounds.

The claim by Planned Parenthood is still off the mark.

In an effort to paint Walker as extreme, the group’s lobbying arm says in a direct mail piece that Walker ""tried to pass a law to allow pharmacists to block women’s access to birth control."" That bill might have made it more difficult for some women to get contraceptives at some pharmacies, depending on who was on duty. But words matter -- the possible narrowing of access to birth control in some cases isn’t the same as blocking it in all cases.

Barnes trip to Mexico trip sparks new round of attacks
","
Editor's note: A response to the Oct. 1 U.S. Senate PolitiFact article can be found in Letters to the Editor 
With the economy and the impact of illegal immigration on the job market on the minds of many voters this political season, Republican nominee for governor Nathan Deal recently attempted to remind Georgians that he -- not Democrat Roy Barnes -- is on their side concerning these issues.

The Deal campaign put together a 30-second ad that begins with Barnes discussing his goal of creating more jobs.

""We need to take care of our own,"" Barnes says.

""Hmm,"" a male voice says. ""Sounds nice. But Roy Barnes proclaimed Mexican workers good for Georgia.""

Deal's proof is an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article from Nov. 8, 2001. The story detailed a meeting between Barnes, who was governor at the time, and then Mexican President Vicente Fox in Mexico City. Barnes is reported as saying that Georgia's experience with a fast-growing immigrant population has generally been beneficial.

""The labor we have received, primarily Mexicans, has fueled our economy,"" Barnes said.

He added: ""We could not have had the Olympics in 1996 had it not been for that.""

The Barnes campaign called the Deal ad a distortion of Barnes' position on immigrants legally working in the United States.

""Barnes praised 'immigration,' not illegal immigration, as having been 'beneficial' as it 'fueled our economy,' "" the Barnes campaign said in a statement. ""He urged President Bush to 'work [immigration] out' because 'governors can't control immigration policy.' ""

Deal campaign spokesman Brian Robinson countered that it is disingenuous for the Barnes campaign to accuse Deal's ad of stretching the truth here. Barnes was certainly aware that most immigrant workers were not here legally, Robinson said.

""For him to imply otherwise doesn't pass the laugh test,"" Robinson said. ""What percentage of that work force meets that criteria [of being in the U.S. legally]?""

We took a look. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimated that in 2009, there were slightly more than 28,000 people in Georgia who were legal permanent residents or ""green card"" holders. The federal agency also tries to keep track of how many people are living illegally in the U.S. About 480,000 illegal immigrants were living in Georgia in 2009, according to Homeland Security estimates, and in 2000 the estimated total was 220,000. The Homeland Security report does not have a breakdown of what percentage of people living in Georgia illegally are from Mexico. Nationwide, Homeland Security estimates that 62 percent of illegal immigrants in the U.S. are from Mexico. Applied to Georgia in 2000, that would be 136,400 illegal immigrants from Mexico. Presumably a large number of those were workers.

Barnes was in Mexico in 2001 for a four-day trade mission. Mexico was Georgia's third-largest trading partner, and Georgia companies were exporting $1 billion in products to that nation. State officials estimated at the time that Latino-owned businesses in Georgia had about $1.3 billion a year in annual sales. Some of Georgia's business titans, such as Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, came on the trip.

Barnes told a story in the 2001 AJC article about farmers in South Georgia, where he said ""it's about as conservative as you can get,"" who wanted him to get health coverage for ""migrant farmworkers."" The governor noted the presidents of the United States and Mexico were discussing proposals for legalizing some undocumented Mexican workers.

""Old ideas have changed,"" Barnes said.

But since then attitudes toward illegal immigration have hardened, as highlighted by a poll that found 68 percent of Georgians support Arizona-type restrictions and enforcement of illegal immigration laws. And many politicians do not want to appear soft on the issue.

Barnes said during a July debate that he would support an Arizona-type law in the Peach State to fight illegal immigration. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed a law that has since gone before the courts that allows state and local law enforcement officers to ask people stopped for possible crimes to show proof they are in the United States legally.

Deal's first television ad, in July, slammed President Barack Obama over illegal immigration, promised Georgia would soon have an Arizona-type law and said he doesn't care what ""liberals"" think. Robinson accused Barnes of running from his ""liberal record"" with his support of the Arizona legislation. ""He is all over the board on this,"" Robinson said.

Andra Gillespie, an assistant political science professor at Emory University, explained that Barnes is trying to cut into Deal's conservative base by taking a stand on illegal immigration that is seemingly popular with most Georgia voters. Gillespie said the Deal statement that Barnes ""proclaimed Mexican workers good for Georgia"" is misleading.

""Nathan Deal's campaign knows very well that when Roy Barnes went to Mexico and praised the contributions of Mexican immigrants [presumably in a spirit of good will and diplomacy], he was not explicitly supporting illegal immigration,"" the professor said. ""But because Barnes did not specify his support for legal immigrant workers, the Deal campaign is taking advantage of the ambiguity and trying to fill in the blanks for voters."" 
We believe the Deal ad does accurately convey the quotes from Barnes in the 2001 AJC article. However, it's unclear that Barnes was talking specifically about illegal immigrants and, moreover, Barnes uttered the quotes nine years ago in a different political and economic climate. It doesn't necessarily follow that Barnes supports Mexican labor in Georgia today. So the ad lacks context that might give viewers a different impression. So by the definition of our Truth-o-Meter, the statement rates as Half True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/18/nathan-deal/barnes-mexico-trip-sparks-new-round-attacks/

But today's venture into the state's vast span o' pumps was touched off by an Aug. 20 press release from Staples' campaign bringing to light a video of Gilbert at the Central Texas Democratic Forum on Jan. 11--yes, January. That's when he told the Dems that he'd fire about half the agriculture department's employees at headquarters in order to hire ""people to put in the field because that's where we need it. Because right now we have so little people in the field, the HEBs of this state, the Brookshires of this state, they're calibrating their own gas pumps. The TDA just sends them the stickers and they calibrate them. So we literally do have the fox guarding the hen house. That's got to stop."" 
We wondered how such a dramatic statement had slipped past us. Has anyone else noticed that the state sends stickers to stores that calibrate their own pumps? Are things that cozy? 
Responding to our query, Gilbert's campaign manager, Vince Leibowitz, said in an e-mail that both HEB and Brookshire independently have their gas pumps certified between state inspections.

Per Gilbert's statement that the agriculture department ""sends them the stickers,"" Leibowitz said Gilbert wasn't referring to the state inspection seals, which he said can only be affixed by agency employees. Leibowitz said Gilbert meant ""independent inspector"" stickers--again, not the same as state stickers--which he said Gilbert has seen on Brookshire pumps in East Texas.  

However, Leibowitz said, ""to our knowledge, TDA does not send out those stickers. Hank misspoke."" Asked if Gilbert subsequently issued a correction or retraction, Leibowitz replied by e-mail that ""someone approached him after this to talk to him about it, and he clarified what he intended to say. He has since not similarly misspoken and has talked about gas pumps dozens and dozens of times on the stump.""

Hot on this sticker trail, we checked with the Texas Department of Agriculture whose spokesman, Bryan Black, said its inspectors are the only personnel authorized to inspect a fuel pump and apply its ""weights and measure seal. That is the law and that is our policy."" 
Stores of all sizes must calibrate their pumps by using registered service technicians, licensed by the TDA, Black said. State law requires each pump to be inspected every four years, he said, though since 2007, the average time between inspections has been 2.6 years.

A TDA Web page says the department has 72 weights and measures inspectors throughout the state checking more than 65,000 fuel pumps a year. Leibowitz said Gilbert foresees eliminating various agency positions and using the savings to hire more field inspectors, but that it's ""inappropriate and premature"" to detail those plans.

Next, we queried HEB and Brookshire about their gas pumps. Both told us they contract the calibration of their pumps to outside vendors.

Explained Sam Anderson, spokesman for the Tyler-based Brookshire Grocery Company: ""If they pass (state) inspection, the Department of Agriculture provides their stickers. If we are not compliant, we have to have our service provider come back out to fix them. Then the department comes back out."" In a follow-up e-mail, Anderson said the grocery store does not have its own certification stickers on its approximately 400 dispensers.

So, how does the meter swing on Gilbert's statement?

Stores do indeed calibrate their gas pumps--by using state-certified technicians. But Gilbert leaves the impression this practice is new and nefarious -- and a substitute for state inspections. It's not. Also, as Gilbert's campaign acknowledged to us, his statement that the state sends stickers to stores simply isn't so.

Gilbert may have only said this to a single audience. Regardless, his claim--which was never corrected publicly--incorrectly suggests wrongdoing, and state complicity in that wrongdoing. On the Truth-O-Meter, that's fuel enough to rate False.",/factchecks/2010/oct/18/hank-gilbert/hank-gilbert-pitching-reorganization-state-agency-/

Kurt Schrader says more Republicans than Democrats voted in favor of the Wall Street bailout
","
  
The Wall Street bailout (or the Troubled Asset Relief Program, as pols would have us refer to it) is right up there with the stimulus and health care reform in terms of  fodder for attack ads this year. Never mind that the bailout was, in fact, proposed and passed before the current Congress, during the very end of the George W. Bush presidency, or that it appears it will be much less expensive than originally expected.

Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader tried to put the program in its proper historical context during a radio appearance on Oregon Public Broadcasting’s Think Out Loud this week. (It should be noted that neither Schrader nor his Republican challenger, Scott Bruun, was a member of Congress when it passed  the bailout.)

Let’s see what he had to say on OPB, while he and Bruun were debating fiscal policy:
  
Schrader: George Bush and the Republican administration is the guys that did the big bank bailout. Do you want to reinstall those people to power? I'm sorry. And Scott's against the Wall Street reforms. 
Bruun: Congressman, remind me when your speaker came into power as the speaker? Remind me what year that was. Was that 2009? No. That was 2007. 
Schrader: Yeah, but the policies came directly out of the Republican administration. I mean -- and more Republicans voted for that than Democrats. 

That last bit stopped us. More Republicans than Democrats voted for the bailout? That would be ironic, given its widespread use as an attack against Democrats these days.

PolitiFact Oregon went straight to the voting records to check this claim.

As it turns out, the House actually had to vote twice for the particular bill in which TARP was included. The first vote was on Sept. 29, 2008. The legislation failed to move, though, with 205 representatives voting in favor and 228 against. Of those who voted for the the passage, 140 were Democrats and 65 were Republicans.

A few days later, with the economy worsening, the bill got a second life when Senate members took a completely unrelated piece of legislation that hadn’t much moved anywhere for months and stuffed it with the bailout language. The new bill passed the Senate on Oct. 1, 2008. On that day, 39 Democrats, 34 Republicans and one Independent voted in favor of the legislation. So, Schrader is wrong there.

The House then voted on the TARP language -- for the second time -- two days after the Senate, on Oct. 3, 2008. Ninety-one Republicans joined 172 Democrats in voting for the bill. Again, Schrader is wrong on this vote.

There’s not much use arguing with official numbers. Schrader’s right on this: The Wall Street bailout -- one of this election year’s go-to boogeymen -- was, at least in part, the product of the Bush administration.

But, he’s definitely wrong when it comes to counting votes: 86 more Democrats than Republicans voted in favor of the program’s ultimate passage. A spokesman for the campaign now says Schrader simply misspoke. PolitiFact Oregon rates this statement False.

Republican Rebecca Kleefisch says Democrat Tom Barrett supports government takeover of health care
","
Even in the run-up to the Sept. 14, 2010 primary, most voters probably paid little attention to Republican Rebecca Kleefisch or any of the candidates for the get-no-respect position of Wisconsin lieutenant governor. 
Since her victory, Kleefisch has proven hard to ignore. 
First, Kleefisch garnered headlines when she revealed she had been diagnosed with colon cancer in the weeks before the primary, had surgery and was declared cancer free. Then, with that in the background, she took center stage in a campaign ad with running mate Scott Walker that assails Democratic gubernatorial nominee Tom Barrett. 
Little surprise the ad focuses on health care.

In the ad, Kleefisch talks directly to the camera:

""Thanks to the highest quality health care system in the world,"" she says, ""I won my battle with cancer. I can watch my little girls grow up. Tom Barrett supports a government takeover of our health care. A plan that would increase costs, lower quality and put government in charge of our health care choices. As a mother and a cancer survivor, that’s unacceptable.""

As Walker enters the shot and nods in agreement, Kleefisch concludes: ""Scott and I and our families think you should be in charge of your health care decisions.""

Strong words. Powerful message. But is it true?

The ad drew cheers on the right and howls from the left, in part because while Kleefisch attacks a ""government takeover"" of health care, her own coverage comes through a state-government plan that covers she and her husband, state Rep. Joel Kleefisch, R-Oconomowoc, and their family.

We’ve been here before, when it comes to the charge that the health care reforms -- ""ObamaCare"" to critics -- amount to a government takeover. But this ad has a bit of a wrinkle, since it also points back to Barrett’s time in Congress and an earlier health-care reform effort.

Let’s sort it all out.

The Walker campaign starts by pointing to Barrett’s support for the Obama-led reforms.

It cites a Aug. 31, 2010 story from the Capital Times that includes this line: ""Unlike his opponents, Barrett touts his support of the federal health care reform bill. For those who call for its repeal, he says he has a few questions."" The story then quotes Barrett: ""Why do you want to take health insurance away from a sick 3-year-old who may now, for the first time, be able to have health insurance? Or why do you want to take health insurance away from a 23-year-old woman who has diabetes but wants to go to college?""

The Walker campaign also points to the fact that, as a U.S. House member from Milwaukee in 1993,  Barrett was a co-sponsor of Hillary Clinton’s ill-fated health-care proposal.

Finally, to support the ""government takeover"" charge, Walker campaign spokesperson Jill Bader points to a chart from the conservative Heritage Foundation that predicted the percentage of national health care spending under government control would pass 50 percent by 2013.

Let’s look at the evidence, piece by piece:

The Obama reforms: Leaving aside, for the moment, whether Barrett supports all or some of those reforms, PolitiFact National and its state affiliates have ruled repeatedly on the government takeover charge and found it ridiculously false -- a Pants on Fire. In truth, the health care law creates a market-based system that relies on private health insurance companies.

To be sure, government regulation of the existing system increases under the new system. More people will be covered. The government will create exchanges to provide coverage for Americans who have trouble getting it now. Medicaid, the government-run health insurance program for the poor, will be expanded.

It is not, as the ad suggests, a single-payer system with government running the sole plan. Indeed, the lightning-rod ""public option"" -- which would have added a government-run plan to the mix -- was dropped from the bill before it passed. Coverage would be paid for the same way it is now, by private employers and individual premiums.

Universal coverage advocates such as Citizen Action of Wisconsin say the national changes mean nearly half a million Wisconsin residents will now have access to private health insurance as Kleefisch and her husband already do.

As for the Heritage Foundation chart cited by the Walker campaign, the study notes its projection that government spending on health care will now exceed 50 percent of the market sometime in 2013 is part of a decades-long trend. Indeed, even without the Obama-backed reforms, the government was on track to pay more than half sometime in 2014.

The Hillary Clinton plan: Before Obama’s plan, there was the 1993 plan that grew out of Clinton’s work on a health care task force as first lady. Critics shorthanded it ""HillaryCare.""

Two national health care experts -- one deeply involved in work on Clinton’s health care proposal -- told PolitiFact Wisconsin that the Clinton approach was more aggressive and far-reaching than Obama’s plan. A third, Robert Moffit from the conservative Heritage Foundation, judges them equally far-reaching.

Clinton’s plan had national spending limits and tried to build a new insurance market with an aggressive regulatory structure, said Judith Feder, a former high-ranking Clinton administration official who is now a professor in Georgetown University’s Public Policy Institute.

Both PolitiFact National and the New York Times have described Hillary Clinton’s plan, which was dead on arrival in Congress, as a ""radical"" proposal.

But neither Feder nor Robert Blendon, a Harvard University professor of health policy and political analysis, think ""government takeover"" fits the Clinton plan -- or the Obama one.

Neither do we.

Let’s return to the TV ad, which emphasizes Barrett supports such a plan:

At a news conference after the ad debuted, Barrett said it is ""not true at all"" that he supports a government takeover of health care and said he had never supported a single-payer system.

Coverage of Barrett’s 1992 congressional bid in the Milwaukee Journal shows that Barrett endorsed universal coverage -- that is, efforts to cover everyone -- but he rejected a government-run system.

But to Kleefisch, Barrett’s view that he does not favor a takeover is undermined by his support for the Clinton plan and his views on the Obama-led reforms.

In an Oct. 14, 2010 interview with conservative talk radio host Charlie Sykes on WTMJ-AM (620), she put it this way: ""He’s a liar.""

Barrett spokesperson Phil Walzak responded: ""Every plan Tom has forwarded has private insurance as the centerpiece. They are trying to generate false fear on this issue.""

As for the Obama-led reforms now in place, Walker has argued they should be repealed and the state should join a lawsuit against them. Barrett has rejected the idea of joining the suit but has said Wisconsin's next governor needs to find ways to make sure the law is implemented fairly for the state.

Where does that leave us?

With the emotional emphasis provided by cancer survivor Rebecca Kleefisch, the Republican ticket echoes the GOP attacks used against Democrats across the country and characterizes the Obama-led health care reforms as a ""government takeover.""  But repeating a falsehood -- however often and however loudly -- does not make it true.

The Obama reforms would expand the government’s role, but a key principle of the plan is to rely primarily on private health insurance to provide coverage. The government ""exchanges"" would encourage private insurers to compete for workers from small businesses who currently may not have coverage.

As for Barrett, they argue that Barrett backed the whole bill, but provide evidence only that he talked up some aspects of it months after it passed. On the support of Hillary Clinton’s plan in 1993, Barrett was a co-sponsor, and some experts say it went further than Obama’s plan. But it still would have retained a private-insurance based system. It didn’t amount to a takeover either.

Can we light two matches? We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/oct/17/rebecca-kleefisch/republican-rebecca-kleefisch-says-democrat-tom-bar/
"['Rhode Island', 'Candidate Biography', 'John  Robitaille']","
Robitaille's bio says he was nation's top ROTC officer
","
Republican candidate for governor John Robitaille talks a lot about his Army record. His current television advertisement touts his experience as a veteran and he regularly refers to his military service during public appearances.

They are mostly passing references, devoid of details.

But on his campaign website, Robitaille gets specific, listing his experience as a paratrooper and his service in Germany. He also notes that he ""served his country as an Army officer for over five years on active duty and was recognized for distinguished performance as the most outstanding second lieutenant commissioned in the US Army through the ROTC program nationally.""

The most outstanding in the entire country? It was just unusual enough to make it worth a check, especially in an era when other politicians have gotten into trouble for citing their military records.

We began our research in mid-September and that's where the obstacles began.

Robitaille told us his documentation of the prize he received four decades ago, known as the Dr. Ralph Mershon Memorial Award, was destroyed in a flood several years ago.

We asked Providence College -- where Robitaille was an ROTC cadet -- for documentation of the award, but officials there said all they could find was a page from the school's1970 yearbook listing Robitaille as an ROTC commanding officer.

Next we filed a records request with the Army. But the public affairs officers at Fort Knox, where the documents are housed, said it kept only ""service records of soldiers who were in service in 2000 and later.""

They forwarded our request to the Military Personnel Records Center, part of the National Archives and Records Administration in St. Louis. The wait time, they told us, would be at least three months unless the request came from the veteran himself.

Robitaille agreed to file a request; the records finally arrived in the second week of October complete with a letter from the Records Center verifying their authenticity.

The  answer was clear: Robitaille won the Ralph Mershon award for the 1969-1970 school year. The documentation proving his claim includes several letters from then-Secretary of the Army Stanley R. Resor. It reads:

""Robitaille attained the highest composite score of all distinguished military graduates who applied for and accepted a commission in the Regular Army.""

That was 40 years ago, but Robitaille said he recalled that each university with an ROTC program nominated the student with the top combined score in academics, ROTC activities and a summer basic training camp. Robitaille got Providence College's nod and was selected as the top candidate from any school.

He said he learned of the award months later, in 1971, when his commander approached him in the officer's club in Germany to extend his congratulations. The way Robitaille remembers it, the commanding general of the 1st Armored Division presented him with the prize that night. The details are hazy, he said, but there was also a check for $400 which for a young soldier, seemed much more exciting than a plaque.

A second letter from the secretary of the Army offers a bit more detail where Robitaille's memory leaves off. It orders the commanding general of the U.S. Army Europe and Seventh Army to present the award ""at an appropriate ceremony and that his personal congratulations be conveyed to Lieutenant Robitaille for his achievements along with best wishes for his continued to success.""

We give this one a definite True and offer our own congratulations. Albeit 40 years late.",/factchecks/2010/oct/17/john-robitaille/robitailles-bio-says-he-was-top-rotc-officer/

Democrat Lee Fisher touts job development success stories across Ohio
","
If Ohio voters take away one line from this years election, it will be that the state has lost 400,000 jobs. It's a number more ubiquitous than your ZIP code and the first talking point of GOP statewide candidates, from treasurer to governor. And its the mantra of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Rob Portman, a former congressman and top adviser to President George W. Bush. 

Portman uses the figure to put his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher, on the defensive. That's because Fisher, who took office in January 2007, also served as the state's development director. That's the position responsible for creating jobs, and Fisher held the title until he announced his U.S. Senate bid in February 2009. 
PolitiFact Ohio has found the figure is accurate, ebbing and flowing from month-to-month, but that it leaves out a lot of context. Namely, the national recession influenced the states job losses more than any single politician, and the states been losing jobs under both Democrats and Republicans for more than a decade.

Fisher blames the state's job losses entirely on the recession created by Bush's job and trade policies, which were influenced by Portman's two years in the White House. 

While Fisher offered the same defense again in the most recent debates, he also highlighted his argument that as lieutenant governor and development director, he was busy negotiating deals to save and create other jobs across the state. 

He drew loud applause from his hometown crowd at the Oct. 8 debate at the City Club of Cleveland when he walked off the stage with this line:  ""If you want to see the jobs that I've saved and created in this storm he helped create, go anywhere in Ohio. If you want to see the jobs he helped to create, go to Beijing, Shanghi, or Hong Kong."" 

PolitiFact Ohio already has examined the second part of this statement. We thought now we'd examine the first part, that Fisher created or retained jobs around the state. 

Fisher is referring to a number of Ohio companies, some well known, such as Akron's Goodyear Tire & Rubber, and some much less familiar, such as Toledo's Xunslight Corp. 

So let's look at some of the deals he has mentioned by name in the debates and on the campaign trail:
  
While Fisher cant claim credit for being singularly responsible for landing any of these deals, he played a role as development director and lieutenant governor. And the state has helped far more companies than noted above.

So, can you find Fisher handiwork in the four corners of the state, as he suggests?

While he's adding a bit of rhetorical flair when he says, look anywhere in the state, he is conveying an accurate picture of his and the development department's work. So we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/16/lee-fisher/fisher-touts-job-development-success-stories-acros/
"['Ohio', 'Rob Portman']","
Republican Rob Portman touts ability to work with Democrats
","
U.S. Senate candidate Rob Portman is a Republican and a fiscal conservative. Those are facts you can measure by his record in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served for 12 years before joining President George W. Bush’s administration.

On a scale of liberal to conservative, Portman’s ratings by special interest groups and by National Journal, an impartial magazine covering Washington, trended toward the conservative end, but that doesn’t mean he didn’t cross the aisle to work with Democrats.

Just how bi-partisan was Portman? Votes can vary depending on the agenda, and Portman has said he would have opposed the major legislative initiatives passed at the behest of the current president, Barack Obama. But he also said during the Oct. 8 debate with Democrat Lee Fisher at the City Club of Cleveland that he has a record in Congress ""of constantly reaching across the aisle and focusing on solutions.""

""I often joke in front of Republican crowds, and probably people are a little nervous by the fact  that 12 of my bills were signed by President Clinton,"" Portman said.

This, too, is measurable. Did the Cincinnati-area Republican really get 12 of his bills signed by a Democratic president?

The short answer: It depends on how you count bills.

The long answer: More or less.

We are being conservative here because lawmakers sometimes claim credit for bills they supported when others really did the heavy lifting. That is not the case with Portman’s count.

But counting bills isn’t as simple as it may sound, and to show how Portman arrives at 12 we must show you, quite briefly, how the sausage is made.

A member of Congress introduces a bill. Other members might sign on as co-sponsors. The bill may get assigned to a committee for review or hearings, and it might get a vote in the full House, then get a vote in the Senate and, if successful, become law with a president’s signature.

Very few bills go that route. Most never make it out of committee. Some get dissected in committee, only to be reassembled in new bill with different sponsors. So here’s the question we faced in reviewing Portman’s claim: Did 12 of his bills actually become freestanding laws signed by Clinton?

No. Four did, according to the official legislation tracking service called THOMAS (in honor of  Thomas Jefferson), maintained by the Library of Congress. The bills provided relief for states from the burdens of federal mandates; authorized the renaming of a federal courthouse; established and paid for programs to promote drug-free communities, and helped alleviate debt for countries that conserve and restore tropical rain forests.

But that number is misleading. THOMAS credits another successful Portman-sponsored bill to Sen. George Voinovich, the Republican whom Portman hopes to succeed. That’s because Voinovich sponsored a Senate companion to Portman’s House measure. The bill made it simpler for individuals and organizations outside of government to apply for federal financial assistance, and its supporters included Democrats such as Dennis Kucinich of Cleveland.

That makes five.

But it’s unfair to stop there, because Portman sponsored another dozen bills that were folded into other legislation that Congress passed and Clinton signed. We know this because when was asked Portman’s campaign to back up its claim, it gave us a list of 17 bills, and we researched them all -- examining not only the original bill’s language and sponsorship but also the language in the final legislation to see how closely it tracked to the original. For example, Portman sponsored bills to make it easier for small employers to set up pensions, and for individual workers to establish retirement accounts. The components for those bills got folded into tax and small business bills -- with precise language coming from Portman’s initial efforts.

He also sponsored two additional anti-drug bills that got folded into a big government spending bill that Clinton signed.

Just to be purists, we excluded a couple of bills from the 17 because, according to THOMAS, Portman was not the sponsor but was, rather, the first and principle co-sponsor. One was to reform the Internal Revenue Service and strengthen taxpayer rights (although Portman had in fact introduced the same bill earlier).  Another was to promote Underground Railroad sites (former Rep. Louis Stokes of Shaker Heights was the sponsor of that one).

But Portman was the sponsor of another bill a year later that assured federal funding for the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati. Supported by such colleagues as the late Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, a Democrat of Cleveland, the bill became a provision in a government spending bill sponsored by yet another former Ohio lawmaker, Republican Ralph Regula of Stark County.

So let’s do the math.

Portman’s campaign gave us a list of 17 bills. We quickly credited Portman on five of them. Twelve more got dissected in the course of legislative sausage-making, but the Portman provisions survived in others’ legislation. But we subtracted two of those bills, because Portman was not the actual sponsor, even though he handled heavy lifting. So we were now down to 15.

But now we faced a question of double counting. If two bills get dissected and their provisions subsequently wind up in a single bill that the president signs, does that mean the president has signed both pieces of legislation? Or does the single new bill only count as one, despite its myriad components?  Who knew that lawmaking had existential questions?

This occurred twice. The first was when separate Portman-sponsored pension and retirement bills (he worked on a number of these) wound up in a single 1996 measure helping small businesses. The other time was when separate anti-drug bills (another recurring theme of his) were folded into a spending measure in 1998.

Just for sport -- we started with a surplus of bills, after all -- we only counted these as one in each instance. So four four of bills got cut down to two.

That left us with 13, or one more than even Portman claimed.

If you think we were too harsh by removing two, go ahead and add them back in so the total becomes 15 again. Portman’s campaign won’t mind, then, if you dismiss a few of his bills as insignificant. One named the federal courthouse in Cincinnati after Potter Stewart. One transferred Army Corps of Engineers property to the village of Mariemont, near Cincinnati. And one established  the CIA headquarters as the George Bush Center for Intelligence (the measure got wrapped into the broader Intelligence Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 1999).

Do all of this and you still wind up with an even dozen.

We bounced this method of counting off Stephen Hess, a senior fellow emeritus at the Brookings Institution and an expert on the ways of Washington.

Hess said that Portman appears to be taking credit where due, and no more. Comparing it with the standards of academia, Hess said, ""If you were writing your dissertation at Wayne State, could you get away with that? Probably so. It would probably just require a footnote.""

When asked, Portman’s campaign was clear about that footnote. Portman’s statement was accurate but needed clarification, which on the Truth-O-Meter is measured this way: Mostly True",/factchecks/2010/oct/16/rob-portman/republican-rob-portman-touts-ability-work-democrat/
"['Oregon', 'Economy', 'John  Kitzhaber']","
John Kitzhaber claims credit for Oregon jobs when he was governor
","
Politicians of all stripes love to tout the number of jobs they have created. Current Oregon Gov. Ted Kulongoski talks about his transportation funding packages that have resulted in new roads while putting people to work. President Barack Obama talks up stimulus spending.

John Kitzhaber -- the former emergency room doctor best known for health care reform and salmon restoration -- is no different.

In public statements, responses and campaign mailers, Kitzhaber states he is the only candidate with a record of creating jobs for Oregon. Sometimes he says that 128,000 jobs ""were created"" during his 1995-2002 reign. Other times he takes active ownership, saying that ""we created over 125,000 jobs.""  In any case, the implication is clear: He was responsible for Oregon’s heady growth during his governorship.

And here PolitiFact Oregon thought the national dot-com frenzy of the 1990s had powered Oregon’s go-go decade. Anyway, we decided to find out more, noting that previously, PolitiFact Oregon had rated Chris Dudley, the Republican in the race, Half True for blaming Kitzhaber for the economic woes that slammed Oregon at the end of his tenure.

First, the numbers.

The Kitzhaber campaign cites the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to back up its claim of 128,000 new jobs. A review of the data shows the campaign is actually lowballing the figure. Nearly 128,000 more people were working in December 2002 than in January 1995, but the number of jobs added over the time period was closer to 179,000.

Either way you count it -- workers or jobs -- there was growth. But how much of it was Kitzhaber's doing? He says a lot.

""During my two terms as governor, we created over 125,000 jobs in Oregon; wages rose by 49 percent and our state gross annual product rose by 48 percent,"" he wrote in July.

""This did not happen by chance. It resulted from a series of intentional decisions based on the recognition that while government doesn't create jobs, it can help create the climate in which job growth can occur. The repeal of the unitary tax; the reform of Oregon's workers' compensation system; the establishment of the Strategic Investment Program; the many trade delegations I led to Asia, Europe and Mexico; the investment we made in rural infrastructure — all laid the foundation for the dramatic economic growth Oregon experienced in the 1990s.""

Let’s break down some of those claims.

Kitzhaber was in the state Senate in 1984, but it was then-Gov. Vic Atiyeh who led the charge to repeal the unitary tax. Before that, multinational corporations could be taxed on sales outside Oregon, discouraging them from setting up in the state.

Kitzhaber was not in office when state lawmakers approved the Strategic Investment Program in 1993, and in fact it was then-Gov. Barbara Roberts who pushed the program, which provides a cap on business property taxes, after losing a multibillion-dollar Intel plant to New Mexico. Over the years, the program helped land biotech company Genentech, LSI Logic and another Intel expansion in Hillsboro. A 1995 story by The Oregonian noted that the state that year ""attracted more semiconductor investment than any other state.""

Kitzhaber played a large role in the 1990 fight to reform Oregon’s costly workers’ compensation system. He was senate president at the time and helped pass landmark legislation lowering the high cost of Oregon’s system. Neil Goldschmidt was governor and Kulongoski was insurance commissioner at the time. Low and predictable rates are good for business.

Finally, it’s true Kitzhaber went on at least five overseas trade missions, mostly to Asia, while in the governor’s office. He was in office in 1996 when Delta Air Lines announced the launch of the first-ever direct flight from Portland to Europe (Frankfurt, with a hopscotch stop in Cincinnati). And he also championed investment in rural Oregon, with money to upgrade sewer and water systems and to dredge the Columbia River.

Kitzhaber campaign spokeswoman Jillian Schoene also added that in 1995 he helped push an ambitious $750 million transportation package, which included a nice chunk for light rail in Portland. In 2002, Kitzhaber started the Oregon Business Plan, a framework still used by business today to get behind a common agenda, such as money for bridges and roads and investments in nanotechnology.

""He gives credit where credit is due when he talks about it. In the ‘80s and through the ‘90s there was a series of intentional decisions made that made our state very attractive to business,"" she said. ""He was part of that.""

But economists agree that the 1990s were just plain strong around the country. In Washington County, Intel eventually led a surge of chip and wafer makers in former farmland west of Portland. Part of the growth had to do with global demand for products; part of the business decisions to settle in Oregon had to do with tax incentives.

""There's no question employment went up during that time period,"" said John Mitchell, a former economist with U.S. Bank who owns a consulting company in Portland.

Tom Potiowsky, who has been state economist since 1999, said the Strategic Investment Program probably helped. But, he added, ""you’re going to have a lot of other things involved, too. You need to have, what’s your transportation look like? What’s your work force like? You have to have some synergy going for you.""

How much Kitzhaber was responsible for that synergy or in laying the groundwork for economic growth is hard to say.

""An awful lot of what happens in Oregon is driven by global and national trends. So that’s probably the biggest overlay,"" said John Tapogna, president of ECONorthwest. ""However, the governor is responsible for setting a tone and building a foundation and climate that is ... a favorable business climate.""

The state must have been doing something right, since personal income per capita grew faster than the U.S. average from the late 1980s to 1997. But after that, the pace cooled.

""A lot of the activity in Washington County either slowed down or fell, and we didn’t have anything to replace it with,"" Tapogna said.  

As the earlier Oregon Truth-O-Meter ruling notes, in 1995, Oregon’s per capita income stood at 97 percent of the nation’s. When Kitzhaber left office it had dropped to 95 percent. It’s true that overall, there was a 13 percent growth in jobs over his eight-year term, but the number of jobs actually began to decline after December 2000.

The bottom line is that Kitzhaber didn’t have to focus too much on job growth or ponder budget cuts for the bulk of his administration. Oregon had scads of money. Just about every state added jobs and workers from 1995 through 2002. In the west, Washington added 319,400 jobs, a nearly 14 percent increase; Colorado, 372,200 jobs, a nearly 21 percent increase; California nearly 2.2 million jobs, or 18 percent increase. Idaho added 103,900 jobs, a 22 percent increase.

The economy was not a central concern for most of his administration. Kitzhaber played a role in making Oregon more attractive to business, but the global and national economies played a larger role in Oregon’s success. The fact of increased jobs in his claim is accurate but by trying to take credit for jobs creation, he leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

Hank Gilbert says gas pumps in every Texas Department of Agriculture region are missing inspection stickers, cheating consumers
","
Hank Gilbert, Democrat for state agriculture commissioner, stood outside a Tyler gas station in September, saying the station's pumps hadn't been inspected by the state to make sure they're working properly since July 1997.

""All over the state, we found stations in every (Texas Department of Agriculture) region that either haven't been inspected in years or they have no inspection stickers on them,"" Gilbert said, according to the Sept. 16 video his campaign posted online. ""If this was inspection stickers for vehicles and you had 20 percent of all the vehicles on the road without inspection stickers, it would be in the news media every day and the state would raising all kinds of Cain because of the revenue being lost to the state. But the revenue is not being lost to the state here, the only people here that are getting cheated are the consumers.""

Sticker-gate? Roll in the Truth-O-Meter.

Background: State law requires each gas pump to be inspected at least every four years by a Texas Department of Agriculture inspector, or more often if a consumer makes an inquiry. The department says an inspector ""will place an 'out of order' tag on any pump not dispensing the correct amount of fuel within the allowable tolerance."" The pump must be repaired, then re-tested by a TDA inspector who will place a new seal on the pump before it can be used again.

Agency spokesman Bryan Black told us in an e-mail that from 2007 to Oct. 4, 2010, the agency inspected 390,837 fuel pumps, with the time between inspections averaging 2.6 years, meaning some pumps have been inspected more than once.

So, how often are inspection stickers missing from pumps? Also, how often does the state fail to inspect them in the required time?

We came up empty on those questions, though a list of inspected stations posted online by the agriculture department shows that in each of the department's five regions, some pumps flunked inspections in the latest review period. From Aug. 5 to Oct. 4, 2010, the agency found 190 stations (including four in Austin) with pumps out of compliance.

When we inquired about the number of stations around the state with pumps that have not been inspected, Black replied that the burden to seek inspections is on retailers that sell gas. He said in an e-mail that fuel retailers are required by law to register annually with the department and that violators are investigated and held accountable.

Black said in an e-mail: ""Since 2007, TDA has quadrupled the penalty for noncompliance with our state's weights and measures laws, created new consumer protections for fuel quality, begun posting violators on the agency website, implemented unprecedented market blitz inspections for those not complying with our laws, and heavily published a toll free hotline for all Texas drivers to use to report noncompliance to TDA.""

Next, we sought to interview Gilbert about the pumps he says lack inspections or have out-of-date inspection stickers. Gilbert's campaign manager, Vince Leibowitz, said in an e-mail that Gilbert wouldn't talk to PolitiFact Texas, which he said Gilbert considers slanted toward Republicans. Later, Leibowitz sent us e-mails listing 15 stores where he said Gilbert identified pumps out of compliance with the inspection law.

In Amarillo, according to Gilbert, seven stores had pumps with no inspection stickers. In the Tyler area, the list shows two stores with pumps having expired stickers and two with pumps lacking inspection stickers. Gilbert's campaign says a store in Trinity has a sticker indicating it was last inspected in the second quarter of 2004 and most pumps at two stores in Round Rock, north of Austin, lacked stickers, meaning they had no proof they'd been inspected. Leibowitz said Gilbert also spotted a store in Weslaco with out-of-date pump stickers.

Using a map of agriculture department districts, we confirmed that the identified stations are spread among all the agency's regions, as Gilbert said in Tyler.

We lacked travel resources to eye most of Gilbert's proclaimed sightings, but Austin American-Statesman colleagues stopped by the two Round Rock stores. On an Oct. 9 visit by Jay Godwin, a Quix convenience store at Highway 79 and Interstate 35 in Round Rock had 2007 inspection stickers posted on three pumps, with seven pumps lacking stickers. Roger Ingram, general counsel for Strasburger Enterprises, Inc., which owns the store, later told us he didn't know why the pumps lack stickers. ""They can be peeled off by just about anybody,"" Ingram said.

On Oct. 11, the newspaper's Miguel Liscano checked a Wag a Bag store noted by Gilbert, on Interstate Highway 35 South; none of its six pumps had an inspection sticker. Cary Rabb, president of Wag a Bag, later told us the pumps were changed out about three months ago, and the company expects the state to inspect the replacement pumps.

Separately, Black guided us to an agency website that displays the inspection status of stations county by county. On the site, we tried to check the inspection status of the stations identified by Gilbert, finding several--including the Round Rock stores--with inspections within the past four years, as the law requires.

In other parts of Texas, five stores named by Gilbert had their pumps inspected within four years, according to the site, and two Tyler stores had pumps inspected after Gilbert aired concerns there, with some pumps not passing. We found no record on the state site of six Gilbert-identified stores.

Gilbert's camp responded to our findings with a statement from Gilbert: ""A pump that does not bear a current inspection sticker is, as far as the consumer knows when he or she fills up with gas, uninspected. If it was inspected at some point in the last four years and doesn't bear seals, it is still non-compliant.""

In an e-mail, Black confirmed that every gas dispenser should have a state inspection seal on it. Possible reasons a pump lacks a sticker, he said, include a flunked inspection, a replaced or refurbished ""pump cabinet,"" someone peeling off the state sticker, a station shifting its pumps without notifying the state and a station opening pumps without registering them with the state.

In a later e-mail, Black cautioned against concluding a pump without a sticker has not been inspected, saying any such claims would need to be verified in the agency's database.

Scott Fisher, vice president for policy for the Texas Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Store Association, told us that it's ""unrealistic"" to think all of the hundreds of thousands of pumps across the state would always show inspection stickers. And Chris Newton, the association's president, pointed out in a subsequent e-mail that big ol' Texas leads the nation in pumps subject to regulation. Another factor in pumps lacking stickers, he wrote, is that ""many pumps are re-manufactured devices that feature an older façade with an older (state) sticker. The device may in fact be properly registered, but may not have a new sticker.""

Our call? We're persuaded there are pumps in every TDA region missing inspection stickers, as Gilbert says. However, the absence of stickers doesn't always means pumps haven't been duly inspected, our peek into the state database suggests. Gilbert's grab-your-pocketbook punch line--that consumers are being cheated--isn't proved out.

 We rate Gilbert's statement Half True.

Blanche Lincoln Ad highlights 23 percent sales tax in ""Fair Tax"" supported by John Boozman
","
In tight races around the country, many Democrats are going after Republican opponents who have supported -- even tepidly -- proposals to replace federal income taxes with a tax on retail sales. Supporters of the idea call it ""the Fair Tax.""

One example is Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln, the Democratic incumbent, who has aired several ads criticizing her Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. John Boozman, for supporting the Fair Tax, which Lincoln believes is a ""dumb"" idea.

We are fact-checking the latest ad, which begins with a clip from a debate on Sept. 8, 2010, in which Boozman said, ""I'm excited about looking at the Fair Tax.""

Then comes the voice-over: ""John Boozman is excited about putting a 23 percent national sales tax on everything you buy. Calling it a fair tax is like putting a dress on a pig. 95 percent of Arkansans would pay more taxes.""

The ad then cuts to another sound bite from Boozman calling the Fair Tax ""a workable solution.""

In some of the Democratic ad campaigns running around the country, the Republican candidates' support for a national sales tax isn't as clear as the ads suggest. For example, some have spoken about it in terms of one of several options that should be considered.

But Boozman's position is fairly well-documented.

Twice, in 2007 and 2009, Boozman has cosponsored ""Fair Tax Act"" bills in Congress. The bills, which have come up annually for years, have all failed to progress to a full hearing. The bills sought to repeal the federal income tax, employment tax, and estate and gift taxes, replacing them with a 23 percent ""national sales tax on the use or consumption in the United States of taxable property or services."" The 2007 bill got 72 cosponsors in the House; and the 2009 bill got 65 cosponsors. But the bills never gained much traction and died.

Here's a fuller context of Boozman's comments about the Fair Tax during the Sept. 8 debate highlighted in the ad:

""I'm excited about looking at the Fair Tax,"" Boozman said. ""I'm excited about getting rid of the IRS...The bill would make it such that you would eliminate all federal taxes. I think it's something that needs to be looked at. It's a workable solution, and it should be gone forward with hearings and things in that manner.""

Boozman campaign spokesman Patrick Creamer said Boozman simply wants the Fair Tax and other options to be debated.

""The congressman is a cosponsor of H.R. 25.,"" Creamer said. ""He did so to move the discussion on comprehensive tax reform forward. He believes our tax system is inherently dysfunctional and needs to be overhauled. He would like to abolish the IRS and replace it with an easier and more fair system of taxation, which is why he supports looking into the Fair Tax as one way to achieve this.""

Critics of the plan call it a regressive tax system that places too much tax burden on middle and lower income people.

Which brings us to Lincoln's claim that the plan would result in 95 percent of Arkansans paying more taxes. That statistic comes from a 2004 analysis from the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice. But it's not an apples-to-apples analysis of the bills repeatedly proposed in Congress. The group's research arm, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, used a 45 percent sales tax for its analysis arguing that was a more realistic percentage for what is needed to raise the same amount of revenue as the current federal tax system. Other economists have criticized the 23 percent figure as well, saying that it would require massive cuts in federal spending (or running up massive debt) if it were used alone to replace the federal income tax. Nonetheless, the figure used in the study is not the 23 percent sales tax figure contained in the bill Boozman cosponsored. What the appropriate percentage for a national sales tax ought to be is a matter for debate, but we think it's misleading to cite the 95 percent figure in the ad based on an analysis of a sales tax that is nearly double the tax rate in the bill Boozman cosponsored.

Our bigger issue with the Lincoln ad -- and a number of similar ads being run against Republicans who have had nice things to say about the ""Fair Tax"" -- is that it highlights support for a 23 percent national sales tax but fails to mention that it would replace federal income taxes. No matter what you think of the plan, that's a very deceptive omission.

As Creamer, from the Boozman campaign, notes, ""Her ads never even mention the fact that it eliminates all your current federal taxes, much less the prebate provisions which give every American an upfront monthly rebate to cover their essential purchases, within the plan.""

The so-called Fair Tax is certainly a controversial, wholesale upheaval of our current tax system. And when distinguishing yourself from your opponent, it's certainly fair to call your opponent's plans ""dumb."" But saying your opponent supports a sales tax increase and failing to mention that it would also mean the elimination of federal income taxes is only telling half the story. And so we rate the ad's claim Half True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/15/blanche-lincoln/blanche-lincoln-ad-highlights-23-percent-sales-tax/

Kendrick Meek says Marco Rubio is too extreme for Florida
","
Democratic U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek is launching a new series of attacks that say his Republican opponent Marco Rubio is ""too extreme for Florida.""

The attacks are housed on Meek's campaign website and include a number of provocative claims -- that Rubio doesn't believe in global warming, that he wants to privatize Social Security, and that he wants to borrow $700 billion from China to fund ""tax cuts for the rich."" Those claims sound dubious, but we decided to focus on the attack Meek launched on Oct. 15, 2010.

The website included an altered comic-like photo of Rubio standing in front of a border fence. The image has a word bubble coming from Rubio's mouth that says, ""Solo Ingles,"" which means English only.

The claim got our attention because Rubio is a child of Cuban immigrants who speaks both Spanish and English fluently. Rubio also has been airing an ad for his Senate campaign in Spanish. So we wondered if it is true.

There's no doubt Rubio supports English as the official language of the United States.

In June 2009, Rubio said, ""We have to have a common language that unites the people,'' and said that language should be English.

In September 2009, Rubio campaign spokesman Alex Burgos reiterated that position, which Rubio again confirmed during a Univision debate. ""Marco believes learning English is essential for success in the United States, and should be the official and unifying language of America,"" Burgos told a reporter.

But while there's no doubt Rubio supports English as the official language, there's also no doubt he opposes any proposal to ban other languages.

From that same June 2009 interview -- ""I'm not in favor of banning other languages, but my name is spelled the same way in Spanish as it is in English.""

And then again from the Univision debate in September -- ""That doesn't mean English only,"" he says. ""People should learn as many languages as they can … But the most important thing that recent arrivals can do for their children is make them proficient in the English language.""

What's the impact of making English the official language? Not much. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has examined this question several times, most recently in January 2007. It concluded that designating English the ""official"" or ""national"" language would have no practical impact.

An official designation alone would not cancel government programs, for instance -- although several pieces of separate legislation proposed in Congress would repeal some federal mandates on things such as non-English ballots. 
Rubio hasn't staked out a position on anything like that.

Instead, Rubio supports making English the official language of the United States, but says he wouldn't want to ban other languages. We don't think that equals an ""English only"" policy. English, for instance, already is the official language of the state of Florida (been that way since 1988), yet the state publishes driver's license forms, state voting materials and public school districts information all in Spanish. We rate the claim Falso (False).",/factchecks/2010/oct/15/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meek-says-marco-rubio-too-extreme-florida/

Harry Reid blasts Sharron Angle for vote against bill to boost sex-offender background checks
","
Last week we checked an ad in which Republican Sharron Angle attacked Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., for voting ""to use taxpayer dollars to pay for Viagra for convicted child molesters and sex offenders."" We rated Angle's charge Barely True.  
Now Reid is parrying the sex-offender charge through an ad of his own that essentially accuses Angle of protecting sex offenders with a vote she once cast against a Nevada Assembly bill. 
The ad opens with a statement by Roberta Vande Voort, a family therapist in Las Vegas. ""I work with kids who have been abused, and their stories break my heart,"" Vande Voort says. ""But when the Assembly created a program to weed out sex offenders by helping youth and church groups do background checks on volunteers, it passed with only two members voting no. Sharron Angle was one of them. She said background checks were an invasion of privacy. Sharron Angle voted to protect the privacy of sex offenders instead of the safety of our kids."" 
Narrator: ""Sharron Angle: Ideas so extreme, they're dangerous."" 
Naturally, we thought it imperative to check Reid's sex-offender-coddling allegations as thoroughly we did Angle's. 
The ad refers to Assembly Bill 239 from 1999. As introduced, that bill would have set up a $200,000 account designed to cover the costs state agencies incur while doing criminal background checks of volunteers who work with children. 
The first stop for the bill was the Judiciary Committee, of which Angle was a member. In introducing the bill to the committee, the bill's sponsor, Republican Assemblyman Dennis Nolan, explained to fellow legislators that during the previous two sessions, he had sought to pass legislation that would allow nonprofit organizations to better screen potential volunteers who would be working directly with children. He said that past efforts had failed because opponents said that ""the $40 cost associated with performing a background check would have a chilling effect on volunteerism."" So AB 239 focused on providing money for background checks, with the idea of removing the cost problem from the equation. 
According to minutes of the committee's March 1, 1999, meeting, Angle expressed some concerns about the bill -- including the one on privacy grounds cited in Reid's ad. 
""Ms. Angle expressed concern with the possible invasion of privacy and liability issues included in the bill,"" the minutes say. ""She stated voluntary programs always stepped up to become mandatory, and she did not want to see the state get involved with things of a First Amendment nature."" 
Angle asked Nolan to discuss the risk of a ""chilling effect"" from the bill. Nolan responded that there would be a chilling effect if an expense was mandated upon the nonprofit organization -- but he added that AB 239 ""was not a mandate of background checks but an attempt to assist with the costs if an organization wanted to utilize the option."" Nolan added that keeping information confidential was crucial, and as to her point about liability, he said that liability existed whether or not background checks were performed. 
On the First Amendment issue, Nolan said that ""the legislature continually dealt with First Amendment issues and that he believed there was a balance. ... The rights we are weighing here are the rights of innocent children who participate in organizations under the supervision of adults and the need to make sure those children are protected."" 
Ultimately, the committee approved an amended version of the bill that changed the $200,000 from a guaranteed appropriation into a funding source consisting of ""donations, gifts, grants, and any appropriations the legislature saw fit to make."" 
At the end of the meeting, the committee unanimously sent the bill to the floor. This is important because, despite the concerns Angle stated in committee, she did not object to the measure going to the floor.  
By April 15, the bill came to a vote before the full Assembly. Despite her assent in committee, Angle did vote against it when it came to the floor, and the measure passed, 40-2. (We did not receive a response from Angle's staff explaining why she voted against the bill.) 
Having cleared the Assembly, the bill then went to the Senate, where it was amended further. On May 20, the newly amended version passed the Senate by a 20-1 vote. (Interestingly, the one Senate dissenter was future U.S. Rep. Dina Titus -- a Democrat and an ally of none other than Harry Reid. When we contacted Titus' staff for an explanation, a spokesman said that Titus voted against the bill because the amendments in the Senate had ""watered down"" the measure so much by protecting nonprofit groups from liability that it ""removed any incentive for organizations to use it."" 
Now that the Senate had approved the amended version, AB 239 had to go back to the Assembly so that an identical version of the bill could be sent to the governor. On May 24, the Assembly approved the new version of the bill, though not through a roll call vote. If Angle had found two fellow Assembly members to back her, she could have requested a roll call vote, but she did not, according to the minutes. 
Ultimately, on May 31, 1999, the bill was signed into law. 
Angle's camp did not get back to us, but in comments published Aug. 30, 2010, in a Las Vegas Review-Journal blog, a spokesman addressed AB 239 as well as two other bills that Reid was touting as evidence of Angle's indifference to law enforcement. ""Sharron agrees with the spirit of those bills and the need for law enforcement to have the proper tools,"" the spokesman said. ""However she had concerns with the execution. At the time, Sharron raised questions in committee regarding the unintended consequences in regards to personal privacy and costs."" 
So where does this leave us? The ad is correct on the substance of the bill, and it's correct that on the most important vote she took on the bill -- the roll call vote on the Assembly floor -- Angle was indeed one of two legislators who voted against it. The ad is also correct that Angle cited privacy as a concern during the debate. 
But the ad glosses over a few bits of context. When the identical bill came up in committee, Angle did not vote against it, nor did she demand a roll call vote on the amended version when it came back to the Assembly from the Senate. In addition, she cited other concerns beyond privacy that may have played into her decision to vote against the bill, including legal liability (which was addressed in the bill's final version), the possibility that such programs could one day become mandatory and First Amendment concerns. 
These failures, in our view, do not greatly undercut the ad's argument, however. 
The notion that Angle ""voted to protect the privacy of sex offenders instead of the safety of our kids"" is an oversimplification. But Angle did vote against it at least once for reasons including concerns about invasion of privacy, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/15/harry-reid/harry-reid-blasts-sharron-angle-vote-against-bill-/

Study claims Amendment 4 will cause a $34 billion impact on Florida economy
","
When Florida voters head to the polls on Nov. 2, 2010, aside from casting votes for public office, they’ll also have six state constitutional amendments to mull over.

One of the proposals up for a vote, Amendment 4, aims to put land use changes before local voters, and has sparked heated debate.

Supporters argue the measure will give more power to local residents by allowing them to make decisions regarding development plans in their communities. Currently, those decisions are handled by an elected or appointed board such as a county commission or a local planning board. Opponents argue Amendment 4 will stall existing projects  and drive away prospective developers from investing money in Florida.

One of those claims of stalled economic growth comes from the ""No on 4!"" website. The website, sponsored by opposing group Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy, Inc., quotes a January 2010 study by the Washington Economics Group which states: ""Amendment 4 will reduce Florida's economic output by $34 billion annually.""

In a state hurting for tax dollars, $34 billion is a large figure to toss around, so we decided to take a closer look at that claim.

Aside from reaching out to the Washington Economics Group to determine how they arrived at the figure, we also received a counter-study by Hometown Democracy, the group backing Amendment 4. We also contacted economists at the University of Central Florida, Florida State University, University of Miami and the University of Florida.

But before getting into all the numbers, data and theories, first a quick primer on Amendment 4.

Amendment 4 was placed on the November ballot after Hometown Democracy was able to collect 676,811 petition signatures statewide, more than the state requirement to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot.

The proposal is summarized as follows on the election ballot: ""Establishes that before a local government may adopt a new comprehensive land use plan, or amend a comprehensive land use plan, the proposed plan or amendment shall be subject to vote of the electors of the local government by referendum, following preparation by the local planning agency, consideration by the governing body and notice.""

Essentially the proposal would allow voters to decide on changes to local land use plans, rather than having the decision rest in the hands of city councils or an appointed local planning agency.

So now that you're an expert on the 1-2-3's of Amendment 4, back to the study in question.

Washington Economics Group Study

The Washington Economics Group is a private consulting firm whose principal adviser is Tony Villamil. Villamil served as U.S. undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, under the George H.W. Bush administration, and is dean of St. Thomas University's School of Business in South Florida.

""It impacts the ability to generate development, expand operations, the ability to attract new companies coming into the state if they're not part of prior growth plans,"" Villamil said in a phone interview regarding Amendment 4 and his study.

The WEG study used computer software called IMPLAN to simulate two outcomes. A ""modest outcome"" where only 10 percent of new real estate developments would require a referendum to amend comprehensive growth plans, and what the researchers call the ""most likely scenario,"" where 25 percent of new real estate expansion will require a referendum.

It's under the 25 percent scenario that the WEG report contends that Florida will suffer from $34 billion less in economic output. The study argues that 125,616 jobs (or approximately 25 percent of the workforce in the development industry) are ""directly endangered.""

Hometown Democracy Counter-Study

Hometown Democracy, the group pushing for Amendment 4, commissioned its own study to refute the claims made in the WEG study. The group hired Braun & Soskin Economic Consulting, run by two University of Central Florida economists.

While we took both studies with a grain of salt, we felt it was important to include the questions and concerns raised by the counter-study.

Braun & Soskin contend that the WEG model did not reflect any ""positive outcomes"" in the study.

""The WEG report admits that much of the adverse effect of the amendment 'will be on large scale commercial and residential developments….' "" the counter-study notes. ""These are the projects that contribute the most to sprawl, urban flight and blight in abandoned downtown areas. The benefits from halting sprawl and blight -- unlike the 'costs' from Amendment 4 are measurable: the saving from holding down crime, commuting times, and public service costs (and taxes to pay for them) to fund sprawling public transportation, EMT, policing, trash pickup and fire protection districts...If Amendment 4 saves Florida these costs, those benefits should be counted in any impact study.""

""WEG makes an untenable assumption that all referenda get rejected by voters,"" Braun & Soskin wrote. ""WEG assumes that all construction jobs are for residential and commercial and none for institutional, industrial, transport infrastructure, extractive and other construction.""

What do the experts have to say?

Since both studies come from groups with vested interests, we turned to economists at the University of Florida, University of Miami and University of Central Florida to help us make sense of all the numbers and theories.

Dr. Christopher Cotton is a professor with UM’s School of Business, who specializes in political economics and experimental economics. Prior to becoming a professor, he worked as a consultant conducting economic impact studies. He has not written or advocated on Amendment 4 in this election.

Cotton was critical of the WEG study, saying: ""I see absolutely no reason to believe the findings of the Washington Economics Group report.""

He explained in an e-mail: ""My biggest criticism is that the report ignores alternative uses of resources and potential benefits. Think about an investor who wants to build a new hotel, but due to Amendment 4 cannot get the rezoning he needs for the project. The report assumes that the investor does nothing with the money that he wanted to use to build the hotel. In reality, he may choose to remodel a run-down hotel instead, or complete another project where zoning is feasible. In reality, he does invest in something else, and this something else will also have economic benefit. This is ignored by the report.""

Dr. Sean Snaith is an economist with the University of Central Florida, and while Snaith penned an op-ed piece for the Sarasota Herald Tribune speaking against Amendment 4, he also expressed hesitation that specific numbers on the financial impact could be reached at this point.

""I think you open up a can of worms,"" Snaith said in a phone interview. ""There are still too many questions up in the air. How is this going to be carried out? In terms of legal battles what will be the time frame? How many more projects will go through? How many less? I don't think we know. You're asking how people are going to behave in terms of voting, and you can't assume that the majority of projects will be rejected. It might be the most environmentally egregious project, but the developers could spend the most money in marketing their project and win the vote. You just never know.""

Dr. David Denslow is a professor at the University of Florida and an economics researcher for the school's Bureau of Economic and Business Research. He too has voiced his opposition to Amendment 4. He said the WEG study is reasonable but far from a certainty. His point:

""We don't know for sure how voters will react, how the legislature will react, how developers will react.  Nor do we know for sure what Florida's growth path would be without Amendment 4, as a base. Adding to the uncertainty is the current truly unusual state of the housing market.  Would Amendment 4 increase the demand for vacant houses because it'll be harder to build new ones?  Or would it reduce the demand because people will think Florida will stop growing and not want to start new businesses?""

As an aside, the state Financial Impact Estimating Conference also provides an evaluation of the financial impact of Amendment 4, as it does for all amendments. That evaluation looks not at the cost of lost (or gained) economic output, but at the cost to cities and counties to conduct special elections.

Comprehensive plans can be amended just twice a year, and between 2001 and 2005, a statewide average of 7,878 amendments was proposed each year. The statement summarizes: ""Assuming every Florida voter is impacted by a single special election, costs would range between $10 million and $20 million."" If lower-cost mail-in ballots are used and special elections affected just 25 percent of the voters, the cost would still be more than $2.4 million, in the state's estimation.

But in the end, the conference found the same uncertainty as the university economists: ""Nevertheless, the amendment's impact on local government expenditures cannot be estimated precisely."" Just another unknown cost we weighed in our consideration.

Our ruling 
So back to the question. Will Amendment 4 reduce Florida's economic output by $34 billion annually? There are bound to be some economic impacts, but as all the economists noted, it would be premature to assume that anybody knows what that impact will be. Developers may decide not to push for projects under the new rules, if the amendment passes. Or they may propose other projects more likely to be approved. And voters may or may not approve the projects that do make the ballot.
