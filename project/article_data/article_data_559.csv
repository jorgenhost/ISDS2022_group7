Dennis Richardson says Oregon is only state to pick up public workers’ full health care tab
","
The issue of public workers and their pay and benefits is en vogue in capitols across the U.S.

Oregon, it would appear, is no exception.

In a recent newsletter to his constituents, Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, argues that state employees need to help pay some of the cost of their benefits packages. Right now, he notes, they’re not responsible for any of it.

That, he says, makes Oregon unique: ""Oregon is the only state out of the 50 states in the USA that continues to pay 100% of the medical benefits for its employees and their families.""

We were of the impression, that yes, Oregon is among a shrinking number of states that pay the whole tab for public worker benefits. But the idea that Oregon would be the only state caught us off guard. So, we looked into it.

First off, we confirmed with Ingrid Norberg, the spokeswoman for the Public Employees’ Benefit Board, that Oregon does, in fact, cover the full cost of certain medical benefit packages for certain employees. That said, employees are still responsible for co-payments in certain cases, she said.

Once we had that confirmed, we stopped by the National Conference of State Legislatures website. The group keeps an eye on state-related issues and trends, and public employee health care plans are among them. According to a report on their site, as of 2009, ""(s)even states paid for 100 percent of the ""defined standard"" monthly premium costs for at least some familiesof state employees."" They listed those states as Alaska, Delaware, Iowa, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Oregon.

So, we placed a call to both Rep. Richardson and the Conference to sort out the discrepancy.  Richardson explained, in a voice mail, that he had taken the information from a December 2010 report by then-Gov. Ted Kulongoski’s Reset Cabinet. He cited, as his proof, one sentence in the report: ""Oregon is one of two states that pay the full cost of health benefits for employees and their dependents (the other is Alaska) and is the only state to do so in plans with no deductibles.""

That’s not quite what the representative said in his newsletter, but we noted the claim and asked Richard Cauchi, the NCSL’s Health Program director, about it.

As far as Cauchi knew, there were more than two states covering 100 percent of the monthly premium cost. Of the seven cited online, he believed a few had since stopped covering the full cost, but that four or five continued to do so.

As for the part about deductibles, he said the group did not track plans in that detail.

Before he ended the call, however, he did add some perspective on the issue: ""The one thing there is in this is a gradual, but real, trend toward employee contribution. Ten years ago there were certainly more states that paid 100 percent of the costs. That's been going down year by year. It’s been a dwindling list, if you will."" 
We decided to go back to one of the sources of the report: Tim Nesbitt, a former chief of staff to Kulongoski. He said the line that Oregon was one of two states to cover the full cost came from the Public Employees’ Benefit Board. We doubled back to spokeswoman Ingrid Norberg.

Norberg did some checking for us and found a set of slides used in a presentation to the governor’s Reset Cabinet. Using a different set of information from the National Conference of State Legislatures, PEBB had reported that Oregon was one of six states that covered the premiums for the lowest-cost medical plan. So why did it make it into the report that Oregon was one of two?

Well, according to the NCSL information, only Oregon and Alaska also cover dental and vision costs.

The comparison, Norberg noted, is still difficult to make -- a ""contribution from the employer may be for a range of benefits and a range of benefit designs. So, comparing one with another is like comparing apples and bananas.""

The bottom line, however, seems to be that Oregon isn’t alone here.

In his newsletter, Rep. Richardson says Oregon is the only state the nation that pays ""100% of the medical benefits for its employees and their families.""

That’s just not true. Even the source he cites contradicts what he wrote. And even that source was a bit misguided in its assertion about Oregon being one of two to cover medical benefits completely. Oregon is one of two states that covers a full range of benefits -- health, dental and vision -- but it’s one of at least four that covers the premiums for its lowest-cost health plan.

Richardson’s larger point, that Oregon is in a shrinking group of states that do so is certainly a strong and valid one. However, he undercuts his argument by resorting to hyperbole. We find his claim False.

U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul says Khalid Ali-M Aldawsari alleged plan to hide explosives in baby dolls is similar to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed's and Ramzi Yousef's 1995 plot
","
Shortly after a Saudi man who attended college in Lubbock was accused of attempting ""to use a weapon of mass destruction,"" U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, issued a statement about his ""likely"" connection to an international terrorist network.

Khalid Ali-M Aldawsari’s ""intent to use baby dolls to conceal chemical explosives is a rare, little-known method used by Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and Ramzi Yousef in the 1995 Bojinka plot in which they planned to blow up 12 jumbo jets over the Pacific Ocean,"" McCaul, a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said in his Feb. 28 statement.

We won’t rule on Aldawsari’s intent or his guilt — that’s for the court to decide. But we wondered about McCaul’s statement that baby dolls figured into both his case, and the 1995 plot linked to Mohammed, who has described himself as the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, and Yousef, convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.

First, some background on the Aldawsari case: Federal agents arrested the 20-year-old former Texas Tech chemical engineering student on Feb. 23 after a search of his home and computer. According to an Associated Press story, federal authorities said he had purchased explosive materials online and planned to hide them in dolls and baby carriages to blow up dams, nuclear plants and former President George W. Bush's Dallas home.

Aldawsari was indicted in federal court on March 9 and if convicted, could be sentenced to life in prison and fined $250,000, according to the AP. He plans to plead not guilty, according to a Feb. 25 New York Times article quoting his lawyer, Rod Hobson. Hobson did not respond to our queries.

Responding to our request for more information about the congressman’s claim, McCaul spokesman Mike Rosen sent us a Feb. 23 affidavit submitted by FBI agent Michael Orndorff to secure the arrest warrant for Aldawsari. According to the affidavit, the FBI launched its investigation after the Carolina Biological Supply in North Carolina, suspicious about an attempted purchase of chemicals by Aldawsari, reported him Feb. 1.

According to the affidavit, Aldawsari had ""made numerous Internet searches related to infants and babies. He viewed photos of realistic-looking newborn and infant dolls. In addition, numerous websites were viewed that are related to baby accessories, including strollers, baby clothes and diapers. Aldawsari also viewed doll photos that appeared to be altered in the neck area, with what may have been a pipe and wires visible.""

Based on his ""training and experience,"" Orndorff says in the affidavit that he ""believes this web activity could indicate Aldawsari’s consideration of the use of a realistic doll to conceal explosives or other weapons.""

Under a section titled ""research of targets by Aldawsari,"" the affidavit says that on Feb. 6, he e-mailed himself Bush’s Dallas address with the subject line: ""tyrant’s house.""

We contacted the Justice Department for more information about the Aldawsari case. Dean Boyd, a spokesman for the national security division, told us that the agency couldn’t talk to the media about it because the federal judge presiding over the case had issued a gag order.

What about the 1995 terrorist plot that McCaul referenced? Did Mohammed and Yousef plan to use baby dolls packed with explosives to blow up planes?

Rosen told us that he didn’t have documentation for that part of McCaul’s statement but that McCaul learned about the doll plan while he was serving as chief of counterterrorism in the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Western District of Texas prior to joining Congress.

Separately, we found a September 1996 Los Angeles Times news article reporting that a federal jury had found Yousef and two co-defendants guilty of planning to blow up 12 U.S. jetliners over the Pacific. According to a 2006 New York Times story, Yousef worked with Mohammed, his uncle, to hatch the plot.

The Times story says: ""Mohammed code-named the operation Bojinka, which was widely reported to have been adopted from Serbo-Croatian, meaning big bang. But Mr. Mohammed has told his CIA interrogators interrogators that it was just a ‘nonsense word’ he adopted after hearing it when he was fighting in Afghanistan during the war against the Soviet Union, according to the 9/11 Commission Report.""

Next, we consulted Stratfor, an Austin-based global intelligence company. According to a September 2009 article on aviation security by Stratfor Vice President Scott Stewart, the Bojinka plot involved using baby dolls to smuggle explosives onto the planes. The article says: ""The baby-doll device was successfully smuggled past security (in Manila, Philippines) in a test run in December 1993 and was detonated aboard Philippine Air Flight 434,"" although it failed to bring the plane down.

The Bojinka plot unraveled when Yousef accidentally set his apartment on fire while making another bomb, the Stratfor article says.

In a Feb. 24 report, Stratfor said accounts that Aldawsari had ""images of dolls apparently manipulated into (explosive devices)"" on his computer hearkens back to Yousef’s attempt to use dolls in the Bojinka plot.

Fred Burton, Stratfor’s vice president for intelligence, was involved in Yousef’s 1995 arrest in Pakistan as a special agent for the U.S. State Department. In a Sept. 17 Web video posted on YouTube, Burton says: ""We were able to go in and capture Ramzi Yousef at a hotel and recover a whole bunch of improvised explosive devices that had been made to look like baby doll bombs that he intended to use to blow up airplanes around the world.""

Yousef is serving a life sentence in maximum-security prison in Colorado, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Mohammed has been held in the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for four 1/2 years, according to a list of detainees on the New York Times.

Summing up: An FBI investigation suggests that Aldawsari could have been considering using a doll to conceal explosives in attacks on U.S. targets, including Bush’s Dallas home. Other reports also indicate that Mohammed and Yousef planned to use baby dolls to conceal explosives in a 1995 plot.

Rep. Dennis Kucinich says GOP budget cuts don't target GAO high-risk areas
","
Temporary spending bills have kept the government from shutting down while Congress tries to reach a long-term agreement for the current fiscal year, which ends in October.

Disagreement over spending cuts created the impasse. Lawmakers have clashed over both the quantity and the quality of reductions. Rep. Dennis Kucinich raised the issue of accountability at a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on which he sits.

In the debate over the continuing resolution that would keep the government up and running, the House had supported amendments that would severely cut or entirely eliminate entities or programs which provide critical assistance to the most vulnerable Americans. Some of those amendments, he said, would eliminate funding for research and for programs needed to address pressing social and economic issues.

""To my knowledge, none of these existing programs appeared on the GAO's list of government programs at high risk of waste, fraud and abuse."" Kucinich said.

The GAO is the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress.

Meanwhile, he noted, several Department of Defense initiatives that ranked prominently in the GAO high-risk report as programs that remain very susceptible to fraud and abuse remained untouched.

Kucinich went on to ask U.S. Comptroller General Gene Dodaro if Congress can be sure that budget requests from the Pentagon reflect actual cost (short answer: no) and to quote an assessment by eight former defense officials that burgeoning budgets have brought weaker forces at higher costs.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look at Kucinich’s claim about the GAO list.

The high risk list is part of a 20-year-old program designed to ""identify and help resolve serious weaknesses in areas that involve substantial resources and provide critical services."" It has designated more than 50 areas as high risk since 1990, and taken more than a third off the list for improvement.

""The 30 areas that we have on the high-risk list right now,"" Dodaro said, ""represent tremendous opportunities to save billions of dollars and, if actions are taken appropriately, to improve the performance and accountability of the federal government.""

Our review of the list, and of reductions proposed to the continuing budget resolution, found that Kucinich was accurate -- there was no crossover, and none of the high-risk areas were marked for elimination.

We also learned that the high-risk roster is not just a hit list of targets ripe for defunding.

The program identifies areas in need of improvement, but not necessarily reduction or elimination, said Christopher Mihm, the GAO's managing director of strategic issues. Some of them could have direct impact on the budget, he said, but ""it's not just a matter of 'If we fix it, the appropropriation will decrease.'""

For example, the high-risk list includes the Internal Revenue Service's enforcement of tax laws. The net tax gap -- the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid -- was estimated at $295 billion.

""You get 5 percentage points off that (through better enforcement) and you're getting real money,"" Mihm said (Collecting 5 percent of that $295 billion would yield nearly $15 billion for the government).

Similarly, the GAO says the Interior Department is not reasonably sure it’s collecting its share of billions of dollars in oil and gas revenues from federal lands and waters. The GAO says more resources, not cutbacks, are needed for reforms.

Kucinich put the Pentagon in a different category.

The GAO and the Defense Department’s inspector general say it does not and cannot even track how or where it spends its money. The eight former defense officials cited by Kucinich, and other officials, recommend that Pentagon spending be frozen at current spending levels until it can pass audits of all of its programs, agencies, and contractors.

Kucinich’s statement is factually accurate, and does not in this case require qualification.

"['Legal Issues', 'Wisconsin', 'JoAnne Kloppenburg']","
Kloppenburg says Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Prosser “has prejudged matters that are likely to come before the court""
","
""The hallmark of a good judge,"" says Marquette University law professor Janine Geske, who served as a Wisconsin Supreme Court justice, ""is somebody who is impartial.

""And what that means is somebody who goes into a case without any prejudgments.""

So, when Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate JoAnne Kloppenburg accused incumbent Justice David Prosser of not being impartial, it amounted to more than mere campaign rhetoric.

In a videotaped interview on March 16, 2011, Kloppenburg declared that Prosser had ""prejudged matters that are likely to come before the court.""

She repeated the charge in a debate six days later, saying: ""I, unlike my opponent, will approach cases with an open mind and without having prejudged the matters that come before the court.""

The Wisconsin Code of Judicial Conduct prohibits judicial candidates from making statements that commit them regarding ""cases, controversies or issues that are likely to come before the court."" It would be a serious matter if Prosser has prejudged cases, such as the court challenge to Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s collective bargaining law.

(On March 24, 2011, the state appeals court panel asked the state Supreme Court to take the case. Prosser has indicated he will not recuse himself.)

So, let’s evaluate Kloppenburg’s claim.

Since the campaign has only begun to take on a high profile as the April 5 election approaches, let’s first lay some foundation.

Prosser, 68, was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1998 and was re-elected three years later to a full 10-term term. He previously spent 18 years in the state Assembly representing the Appleton area; for eight of those years he was the Republican leader.

Kloppenburg, 57, of Madison, has been an assistant state attorney general since 1989, working both as a prosecutor and a litigator. This is her first run for public office.

Kloppenburg has made contributions to Democratic candidates, but not Republicans, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign database. Groups that have endorsed her most recently include the Sierra Club, the Madison police union and a union that represents public employees in Milwaukee County.

Since 2008, Prosser has been part of a 4-3 conservative majority that controls the Supreme Court. A win by Kloppenburg, who is backed by many people upset with Walker’s collective bargaining law, would create a 4-3 liberal majority.

We asked Kloppenburg campaign spokeswoman Melissa Mulliken for evidence that Prosser has prejudged matters that are likely to be brought to the high court -- more specifically, which matters. Mulliken said there were none. Kloppenburg’s allegation against Prosser, she said, was made as a broader statement.

Accusing Prosser of prejudging matters, but providing no examples … well, that takes a lot of the steam out Kloppenburg’s claim.

Her campaign did cite four statements -- three by Prosser’s campaign spokesman, Brian Nemoir, and one by Prosser himself -- as evidence to back up the accusation. We treat a statement from a spokesman as having been made by the candidate himself.

So let’s examine what Kloppenburg cited.

""Complement""

In a Dec. 8, 2010, news release announcing Nemoir as Prosser’s campaign spokesman, Nemoir said Prosser would be a ""common-sense complement to both the new administration and Legislature.""

The reference was to Walker, who had been elected governor but not yet taken office, and Republicans who would control the Senate and Assembly in January.

Prosser disavowed the statement weeks later, saying he had not seen it before it went out.

But the statement left a clear impression that, rather than being part of an independent judiciary, Prosser saw himself as in league with Republicans who controlled the executive and legislative branches of government.

""Closely mirrors""

After Kloppenburg blasted the ""complement"" comment, Nemoir responded with an e-mail the next day describing Prosser as an independent, ""rule-of-law judge.""

In the same statement, however, Nemoir said Prosser’s ""personal ideology more closely mirrors that of the incoming administration and Legislature.""

The Kloppenburg campaign cited that as evidence of prejudging.

But Kloppenburg ignored the rest of Nemoir’s quote, which was that Prosser’s ""impartial approach to applying the law won't deviate"" -- in other words, that he would not prejudge cases.

""Conservative majority""

Nemoir said Feb. 9, 2011, that the Prosser-Kloppenburg race ""is about a 4-3 common-sense conservative majority vs. a 3-4 liberal majority, and nothing more.""

This statement essentially reiterates that Prosser is a conservative who could hold a swing vote on the Supreme Court. It doesn’t support Kloppenburg’s claim that Prosser has shown he would prejudge cases.

""Political conservative""

Kloppenburg’s campaign cited instances in which Prosser also described himself as a political conservative, and claimed that indicates prejudging.

At a March 22, 2011, debate, Prosser acknowledged being a political conservative. But he said that since becoming a justice, he has ""tried very hard to withdraw from the political process, move to the center of the political spectrum, and view each case impartially on the facts of the law.""

As with the earlier comments, Prosser calling himself a political conservative is not evidence that he would ignore facts and the law in how he votes on the Supreme Court.

Time for a verdict.

The statements cited by Kloppenburg indicate Prosser is politically conservative, has views similar to Walker and GOP leaders in the Legislature, and that his re-election would maintain a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. The fact that Prosser disavowed one statement, about his being a ""complement"" to Walker and other GOP leaders, indicates he had concern about signaling how he might rule on cases.
 
But Kloppenburg didn’t accuse Prosser of giving signals. She said he had ""prejudged matters that are likely to come before the court."" Yet she could provide no examples.

We rate Kloppenburg’s claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/27/joanne-kloppenburg/kloppenburg-says-wisconsin-supreme-court-justice-p/
"['Environment', 'Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Energy', 'Jon Brien']","
Rep. Brien says Woonsocket needs garbage-burning power plant because of the high price of electricity generated by foreign oil
","
State Rep. Jon D. Brien, D-Woonsocket, has proposed legislation that would override Rhode Island’s 20-year ban on trash incinerators and permit Woonsocket to host a waste-to-energy plant.

In a news release from the State House, and later at a hearing on Thursday before his House Committee on Municipal Government, Brien made two arguments.

First, he said it makes no sense to continue dumping garbage at the Rhode Island Central Landfill, which the state has to continually expand, especially because the garbage could be transformed into a viable alternative energy resource.

""Rather than burying trash in the ground and that being the end of it, why not use it to create electricity?"" Brien said in an interview.

That puzzled us, because the state’s Resource Recovery Corporation already generates electricity from garbage, collecting methane gas produced by the decomposing trash deep in the landfill and piping it to a commercial plant that burns the gas to produce power.

But it was his second point -- that the waste-to-energy plant is needed because  ""residents are paying through the nose for electricity that’s fueled by foreign oil, at prices that are skyrocketing"" -- that really jumped out at us.

Power plants in Rhode Island converted long ago from burning oil to burning natural gas. Most new plants burn natural gas. The one big exception remains the Brayton Point power plant in Somerset that burns coal, and a little natural gas.

So we wondered how the Woonsocket waste-to-energy plant that Brien supports would have any effect on our dependence on foreign oil.

We contacted ISO New England, the independent, not-for-profit corporation that oversees the distribution of electricity throughout New England. Spokeswoman Ellen Foley directed us to a chart showing electric power energy sources in New England.

The chart shows that natural gas accounted for 32 percent of  the power generation in New England in 2010. Nuclear was the next biggest source, at 29 percent. Coal generated 11 percent of New England’s power. Hydropower generated another 5.5 percent. Renewable sources such as wind, solar, and landfill gases provide 6 percent.

The power plants that can run on either oil or natural gas produced 12 percent of the region’s power. But ISO officials say they burn mostly gas, because oil is so expensive.

In fact, it’s so expensive that the amount of power generated by oil, according to ISO, was only 0.4 percent. In other words, nearly zero.

When we asked Brien about this discrepancy, he insisted that oil is used to generate electricity used locally.  And with oil trading at a two-year high, he said it is possible that oil is affecting electricity prices. That is certainly true nationally, he said.

No, it’s not. Nationally, oil produces less than one percent of the nation’s electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Bottom line: an extremely small percentage of Rhode Island’s and New England’s electricity comes from high-priced foreign oil.

One would expect a state representative who is pushing a power plant in his district to know that.

"['Jobs', 'Virginia', 'Jim Moran']","
Rep. Jim Moran says ending federal funding of NPR would jeopardize 9,000 jobs
","U.S. Rep. Jim Moran took to the House floor March 17 to defend National Public Radio.

The Northern Virginia Democrat’s speech came before the House voted to approve a bill that would strip federal funding from NPR and bar local stations from using their own federal money to buy NPR programs.

""Most people like their local NPR station; I like mine,"" Moran said. ""...But the funding restrictions put forward in this legislation strike at the heart of these great stations. It will cripple their ability to produce local programming. Eliminating funding for NPR would do little to rein in our national debt. It will not create jobs. In fact, 9,000 would be in jeopardy if this passes.""

We wondered if 9,000 jobs would really be put at risk by the bill.

First, a word on how funding works for NPR and local affiliates. NPR is an independent media company funded by a variety of sources. Independently owned, non-profit stations around the nation pay a membership fee to join the NPR network and then purchase programs produced by NPR, such as Morning Edition or All Things Considered.

Stations also produce their own programs and buy shows from other sources, such as Public Radio International, which produces This American Life, or American Public Media, which produces Marketplace.

NPR says 34 percent of its funding comes from station programming fees and another 22 percent from sponsorships. The company receives about 2 percent of its money from the U.S. government, via the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and grants awarded by other federal departments.

Local public radio stations, such as Richmond’s WCVE, are endowed by a variety of sources, including funds from the CPB. The radio station shares $1.12 million in federal money with public TV stations in Richmond and Charlottesville, an amount that makes up 14 percent of the budget for the TV and radio stations. Other funds come from the state government, private donations and corporate sponsorships.

Stacey Karp, who works for the Association of Public Television Stations, said 21,000 people work in public TV or radio, with about 40 percent, or 8,400, working for NPR or local affiliates. The association and NPR have joined forces during the current debates over public media funding. So Moran is saying Lamborn’s bill puts every single public radio job at risk.

The bill approved by the House -- and now before the Senate -- was introduced by Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo. It would remove $5 million in direct federal funding from NPR. It would also forbid stations from using the federal money they get from CPB to buy NPR programming or pay their NPR membership dues.

""It would require the stations to keep strict accounts and separate those funds,"" said Catherine Mortensen, a spokesperson for Lamborn. She said the money could be spent on maintenance, staff salaries and the production of local programming, as well as any other expenses not related directly to NPR programming.

Local stations could still use their other funds, such as donations from individuals or corporations, to purchase NPR programs or pay membership fees.

In the end, the only money actually lost would be the $5 million removed from NPR. According to the company’s audited financial statements, revenue for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2010 was $184.3 million, up from $148.7 million the prior year. So losing the $5 million would have cost NPR 2.7 percent of its 2010 revenue or 3.4 percent of its 2009 revenue. Neither of those percentages seem like they’d put NPR out of business.

Under Lamborn’s bill the various member stations would not lose any CPB money; they would just be restricted in its use. So while some dollars might need to be redirected, overall funding for stations should remain unaffected.

Moran could have easily attacked another GOP-sponsored bill that has a far greater potential to put public radio jobs at risk. The House’s proposed budget for the rest of fiscal 2011 eliminated all federal funding for the CPB. The corporation received $420 million in fiscal 2010 fiscal is slated to receive $430 million for this fiscal year.

The House budget was rejected by the Senate, leading the two chambers and President Barack Obama to compromise on two ""continuing resolutions"" that will keep the federal government operating until April 8.

But Moran was not referring to the House budget bill in his March 17 speech. He was clearly attacking H.R. 1076, Lamborn’s bill.

Let’s review.

Moran said H.R. 1076, which would strip NPR of federal funding and set certain rules on how public radio stations nationwide could spend federal money, would put 9,000 jobs at risk. He based this on information from NPR, and a spokeswoman for public TV and radio said 8,400 people work in public radio.

But even if this House-approved bill gets past the Senate and is signed by the president, it would cost NPR a very small fraction of its total budget. And it would not cost local stations any money at all.

With no dollars lost at local stations, we don’t see why this bill would cause layoffs. And with NPR’s revenues growing each year by amounts far exceeding the $5 million at stake, it would seem jobs should be safe at the parent company. If you take $5 million and divide by the 8,400 jobs supposedly at risk, you get a salary per person of $595. We’re certain NPR pays better than that.

Moran suggested this bill could put every public radio job in America at risk. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2011/mar/26/jim-moran/rep-jim-moran-says-ending-federal-funding-npr-woul/
"['Abortion', 'Texas', 'Wayne Christian']","
State Rep. Wayne Christian says Central Health in Travis County is the only hospital district statewide to subsidize abortions with tax dollars
","
State Rep. Wayne Christian is behind legislation prohibiting hospital districts from using tax dollars to fund abortions, but the ban would affect just one hospital district statewide, according to the Republican from Center.

""Currently the Travis County Healthcare District, known as Central Health, is the only hospital district in Texas that spends taxpayer dollars on abortions,"" he said in a March 15 press release.

The only one? Responding to our query for more information, Jon McClellan, Christian’s chief of staff, passed on an e-mail from Joe Pojman, executive director of Texas Alliance for Life.

""We know of no other hospital district that pays for elective abortions (abortions for reasons other than to save the mother’s life),"" Pojman said. ""To our knowledge, the only other hospital district that funded elective abortions was in Tarrant County, and they changed their policy to not fund elective abortions approximately 20 years ago.""

Pojman told us that he based his conclusion on news stories and websites for hospital districts in several counties, including Harris, Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar and Nueces.

""None list abortion as a service provided,"" he said. ""We also inquired with individuals in several other counties knowledgeable about their local hospital districts. All believe their local hospital districts do not fund abortions.""

Next, we contacted the Travis County hospital district, which was created in 2004 following a countywide vote. Central Health operates the Medical Assistance Program, which Austin created in the 1970s to provide low-income residents with subsidized health care services. According to its website, Central Health arranges health care services for Travis County residents who aren’t eligible for other insurance programs. Residents at or below the federal poverty line can qualify for full benefits, according to the site.

Spokeswoman Christie Garbe told us that she couldn’t speak for other districts but said Central Health uses tax dollars to fund abortions. ""Austin and Travis County has a long history of funding reproductive health services for women — the full range of health services,"" she said.

The Central Health board voted unanimously in December 2009 to renew a $450,000, five-year contract with agencies to provide pregnancy termination services and counseling, according to a September 2010 Austin American-Statesman news article. Abortion funding accounts for less than half of 1 percent of Central Health’s $102.6 million budget for fiscal year 2011, Garbe said.

About 60 percent of Central Health’s budget is funded from property taxes, Garbe said. The rest is funded by other revenue, including money from tobacco settlements and leasing income from hospitals the district owns, such as University Medical Center Brackenridge.

Next, we tried to gauge whether other hospital districts put tax dollars toward abortions.

Christine Mann, a spokeswoman at the Texas Department of State Health Services, told us the agency doesn’t track hospital district funding sources. But Mann pointed out that some facilities may provide abortions to women who are insured through Medicaid.

Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman with the Texas Department of Health and Human Services, told us that in 2010, the Texas Medicaid program paid for one abortion in Brownsville. ""In that case, the mother’s life was in danger,"" she said. Texas follows the federal standard imposed by the Hyde Amendment in 1976, which allows Medicaid funding for abortion only in cases of rape, incest and life endangerment.

Goodman couldn’t tell us in what facility the Brownsville abortion took place because the agency tracks such Medicaid payments through individual medical claims — private information it can’t release, she said.

Next, short of calling every hospital district statewide — Texas Hospital Association spokeswoman Amanda Engler said there are about 180 — we asked several in Texas’ larger cities whether they fund abortions with tax dollars.

Candace White, a spokeswoman with Parkland Health and Hospital System in Dallas, told us that while Parkland funds reproductive services with some tax money, abortions aren’t included. Melinda Muse, a spokeswoman with tax-supported Harris County Hospital District in Houston, likewise said the nonprofit doesn’t subsidize abortions.

Martha Althoff-Olivas, a spokeswoman with the University Medical Center of El Paso, told us the district doesn’t perform abortions unless the mother’s life is in danger. If the woman was insured through Medicaid, she assumed the procedure would be covered, she said. Both Diana Carroll, a spokeswoman with JPS Health Network in Fort Worth, and Leni Kirkman, a spokeswoman with University Health System in San Antonio, told us their districts don’t offer abortion services at all.

Vicki Saporta, president of the National Abortion Federation, which represents abortion providers, said: ""To our knowledge, no other hospital district in Texas provides coverage for medically-necessary abortion care for low-income women. However, federal Medicaid funds cover abortions in cases of rape, incest or life endangerment at Texas hospitals that are enrolled in Medicaid providers.""

A December 2009 Statesman news article also says Central Health ""is now the only government entity in Texas that uses public money for abortions."" Another December 2009 Statesman news article quotes Megan Peterson, director of advocacy for the Boston-based National Network of Abortion Funds, saying: ""This idea of the city setting aside money to help pay for this is definitely unique to Austin.""

Admittedly, we haven’t checked every hospital district in the state, but we’ve found no information contrary to Christian’s statement. We rate this statement as True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/26/wayne-christian/state-rep-wayne-christian-says-central-health-trav/

Kim Thatcher says concealed handgun applications require great deal of personal information
","
The Oregon House recently passed a bill that would remove concealed handgun applications from the public record. Proponents of the bill say that there’s too much personal information on individual citizens tied up in the documents.

Public records should focus on the government, not private citizens, they say.

Here’s Rep. Kim Thatcher’s full-throated defense of the move from the House debate on the day they passed the bill:

""As the law stands now, the information in these applications includes things like, home phone numbers, home address, Social Security numbers, what kinds of guns you have in the house -- that's what's on the application -- whether you were dishonorably discharged from the military, what controlled substances you are taking and were you ever accused of -- accused, mind you -- of stalking,"" Thatcher, R-Keizer, said. ""And right now all of that would be subject to public records disclosure.""

That’s an awful lot of information, indeed. But being our usual suspicious selves, we wondered whether all of that was truly included in the application.

So, we did a quick check -- well, we thought it would be a quick check. We’d just pull down the Multnomah County Sheriff’s online license application and take a look, right? Well, it turns out that each of Oregon’s 36 counties has a slightly different application -- some considerably more stringent, some considerably less. After a few days of web searching and phone calling, we got our hands on 34 of the applications.

Here’s what we found:

-""Home phone numbers"": Yes. This is one of the first things every application we reviewed asks for.

-""Home address"": Yes, again. You also have to include a mailing address if that’s different.

-""Social Security numbers"": Sort of. Every application we reviewed asks for a Social Security number, but all, save two, expressly note that ""disclosure of your Social Security account number is voluntary.""

-""What kinds of guns you have in the house"": Not usually. On 24 of the applications we looked through, there was no question asking applicants about current ownership. Of the remaining eight, six asked whether you ""currently own or possess a firearm,"" but only if you have ever been dishonorably discharged from the armed forces, renounced your U.S. citizenship, been ordered to register as a sex offender in any state or use controlled substances. Everybody else can skip the question. The remaining four from Baker, Grant, Gilliam and Klamath counties ask all applicants for this information.

-""Whether you were dishonorably discharged from the military"": Yes, this is on most applications. If you have been, you also have to say when it happened.

-""What controlled substances you are taking"": Yep, this is there. Such controlled substances, for those who are curious, include but are not ""limited to, marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, methadone, LSD, or ecstasy."" (That quote is from the Multnomah County application.)

-""Were you ever accused of ... stalking"": Nope. Eleven applications don’t touch on this subject at all. The other 23 ask only if the applicant is ""currently subject to any type of restraining or stalking order by the court."" They also have to include some specifics about that situation if that question applies to them. That said, if the order has been lifted, the question doesn’t apply -- note the word ""currently.""

For what it’s worth, those last two questions (the one on controlled substances and the one about stalking) are pretty important given that federal law, according to the application, prohibits folks who say yes to those questions from possessing firearms at all, much less handguns of the concealed variety.

Thatcher is spot on when it comes to four of her assertions (the phone numbers, home addresses, military discharge and controlled substances), but she’s less accurate on the other three  (social security, current gun ownership and stalking).

When we called her office, Rep. Thatcher -- and later her spokeswoman Dawn Phillips -- told us she wasn’t making sweeping proclamations about all of the applications. What matters, they said, is that her comments apply to some of the state’s 36 applications. On that point, she’s pretty close to right. That is, except for the stalking claim. Thatcher makes it sound as though anybody accused of stalking at any point in their lives would have to say so on the application. But that’s just no true.

On certain applications, you have to noted whether you are currently under a court order. That’s considerably different, in our view.

Still, we’ll give her the benefit of the doubt that some of the necessary nuance was left out because her comments were spoken -- not written -- and rate this claim Mostly True.

Planned Parenthood funding: Did the GAO really find millions missing?
","
Congress is looking to reduce federal spending, and one of the organizations under scrutiny is Planned Parenthood, a group that promotes contraception and family planning.

Planned Parenthood is also a well-known abortion provider. Opponents of abortion charge that while Planned Parenthood gets federal dollars ostensibly tagged for preventive health care -- things like pap smears and HIV prevention -- the money supports the overall organization and its abortion services.

We noticed one argument made by several websites and columnists recently, that Planned Parenthood was awarded more money from the federal government than it spent.

One of the earlier versions of the claim was from the conservative website WorldNetDaily. A July 2010 news report said: ""A U.S. Government Accountability Office report says Planned Parenthood Federation of America cannot find some $1.3 billion given to it by the federal government from 2002 through 2008.""

WorldNetDaily’s statement was made last year, but we feel it’s fair to check since it’s being repeated now that Planned Parenthood is again in the news.

WorldNetDaily went on to note that Planned Parenthood had received $2.02 billion in federal grants from 2002 through 2008, even though ""the nation's largest abortion-industry player only reported spending $657.1 million of the taxpayer funds.""

Did the GAO find that $1.3 billion in funds went missing? We decided to check it out.

The official number: $657.1 million

The Government Accountability Office report in question, published May 28, 2010, compiled federal funds disbursed to family planning agencies for the fiscal years 2002 to 2009. The agencies included Advocates for Youth, the Guttmacher Institute, the International Planned Parenthood Federation, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Population Council and the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States.

Members of Congress who requested the report oppose funding for abortion providers. But we should note that the GAO is a nonpartisan, respected office, whose findings are often cited by both parties.

The report documented how much different groups received from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for HIV/AIDS, family planning, and reproductive health, both in the United States and abroad.

The report stated that Planned Parenthood spent $657.1 million in federal funds between 2002 and 2009. That was the amount Planned Parenthood itself reported to the government in the form of audited annual reports, which the GAO described as ""sufficiently reliable for our purposes.""

The WorldNetDaily account said unequivocally that ""the GAO report said that Planned Parenthood had received $2.02 billion in federal grants from 2002 through 2008 but that the nation's largest abortion-industry player only reported spending $657.1 million of the taxpayer funds."" 
But there was no statement nor any evidence anywhere in the GAO report that Planned Parenthood received $2.02 billion or that any money was missing.

The other number: $2 billion

The first reference we found to $2 billion or more was a June 2010 op-ed in the Washington Times by Rita Diller, the national director of Stop Planned Parenthood, which is part of the American Life League. (Diller is quoted in the WorldNetDaily story. We contacted her for comment but did not hear back.)

In 2010, Diller wrote that ""Planned Parenthood Federation of America’s (PPFA) audits show the organization spent just $657.1 million between 2002 and 2008 from federal government grants and programs, but the abortion behemoth’s own annual reports show that it took in $2.3 billion from government grants and programs during the same time period."" 
Unlike WorldNetDaily, Diller made it clear that she was questioning the difference between the GAO report and Planned Parenthood's previously published numbers.

Diller’s Stop Planned Parenthood web site tracks money that Planned Parenthood lists in its annual reports. According to those reports, Planned Parenthood received a total of $2.02 billion in federal funding for the years 2002 to 2008. We compared the information from Diller’s site with Planned Parenthood’s actual annual reports and found the numbers appeared to be in order.

Different ways to count the money

So the GAO report never said that there was $2 billion in funds with only $657 million spent. But it still raises the question: Why the difference between the GAO report and Planned Parenthood’s annual reports?

The report itself explains one difference. GAO said it was not able to count all the federal funds that ultimately go to Planned Parenthood, because sometimes the group receives government contracts or grants indirectly. The Department of Health and Human Services, for example, gives grants to states that then give money to Planned Parenthood. Similarly, USAID gives money to other groups that sometimes subcontract with Planned Parenthood. The report didn’t include those funds. ""As a result, obligations and disbursements in this report may understate the actual amount of federal funds provided to the selected organizations and their affiliates,"" the report noted.

We next contacted Planned Parenthood. Spokesman Tait Sye offered several additional reasons for the difference between the amount in the GAO report and Planned Parenthood's numbers.

• In its annual reports, Planned Parenthood reports all government funding as one category, which includes federal, state and local funding. The GAO report counted only direct federal funding.

• Planned Parenthood sometimes gets money from Medicaid, a state-federal partnership that offers health insurance to the poor. The GAO report does not appear to count money from Medicaid.

• Planned Parenthood has more than 80 affiliates, many of which get subcontracts paid for with federal funding. The GAO report noted that it only counted money for 21 affiliates.

Finally, Sye noted that the federal funding Planned Parenthood receives is routinely audited to make sure it is spent appropriately.

Our ruling

WorldNetDaily wrote, ""A U.S. Government Accountability Office report says Planned Parenthood Federation of America cannot find some $1.3 billion given to it by the federal government from 2002 through 2008."" We found other websites making similar claims.

The GAO never reported that Planned Parenthood and its affiliates couldn’t find $1.3 billion. It simply said that Planned Parenthood spent $657.1 million. The GAO also didn’t say that there was any sort sort of discrepancy or that money was missing, as the headline on WorldNetDaily’s news report said. The website's conclusion was reached by looking at numbers not even mentioned in the GAO report. 
In fact the statement conflates two different sets of numbers and is an extreme case of comparing apples to oranges, taking one number calculated by the GAO, and another calculated by adding numbers published in Planned Parenthood’s annual reports. The difference is what is claimed to be missing.

Planned Parenthood includes all federal, state and local money under the category ""government grants and contracts"" in its annual reports. The GAO only looked at direct federal funding and noted it was likely undercounting the amount Planned Parenthood receives. 
The statement irresponsibly suggests misappropriation of federal funds without any evidence. That makes it not just false, but ridiculously so. As a result, we rate the statement Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2011/mar/25/worldnetdaily/planned-parenthood-funding-did-gao-really-find-mil/
"['Labor', 'Florida', 'Grover Norquist']","
Anti-tax leader Grover Norquist said union dues fund half of Florida Democratic political campaigns
","
Grover Norquist, whom a Miami Herald writer recently called the ""the high priest of anti-taxation,"" is interjecting himself -- accidentally or on purpose -- into a debate over whether Florida governments should collect union dues through automatic payroll deduction.

Norquist, the president and founder of the group Americans for Tax Reform, went to his Twitter account on March 24, 2011, to praise Gov. Rick Scott's decision to sign a bill that would link teachers' raises to their students' performance on end-of-year exams. But in his support for the signing of SB 736, Norquist also touched on another hot-button issue being considered by the Florida Legislature -- ""paycheck protection.""

Rep. Chris Dorworth, R-Lake Mary, and Sen. John Thrasher, R-St. Augustine, have offered HB 1021 and its companion SB 830, which would prohibit public-sector unions from using automatic payroll deductions to collect union dues. The bills also would require union members to sign an authorization each year allowing the union to use their dues for political purposes. The bill passed the House 73-40 on March 25, and is awaiting action in the Senate.

Dorworth and Thrasher have argued that the legislation will empower union members because it gives them more control over how their money is spent. Thrasher also has claimed that eliminating payroll deductions would save government resources, a notion PolitiFact Florida found Barely True.

Norquist offered a more pointed, and political effect of the legislation.

""FYI,"" he wrote. ""Withheld union dues fund half of Dem (Democratic) campaigns in Florida.""

That's an awfully big number. So, FYI, we decided to check it out.

We sent e-mails to Norquist, who has talked to us before, and his spokesman John Kartch but did not hear back.

The not-for-profit, nonpartisan National Institute on Money in State Politics is the only organization that we know of that analyzes and organizes state-level campaign contributions for all 50 states. The institute separates campaign donations received by party, and also 19 different industry sectors.

In 2010, Florida state candidates received a total of $332 million in contributions, according to the institute. Of that sum, $89 million went to Democrats and $195 million went to Republicans (the remainder went to third-party candidates or ballot measures). 
One of the industry sectors that the institute uses is classified as ""labor"" and is made up of general trade unions, public-sector unions and transportation unions. Contributions classified as ""labor"" went heavily to Democrats, according to the institute. But nowhere near the percentage that Norquist suggested.

Labor contributed a total of $13.8 million to Florida political campaigns in 2010 -- $10.2 million to Democrats, about $1 million to Republicans and the rest to third-party candidates or campaigns for ballot measures.

That translates to about 11 percent of total Democratic donations -- way lower than Norquist said.

Moreover, he said ""union dues"" were funding 50 percent of Democratic campaigns.

The institute's 11 percent figure includes direct contributions made by unions through dues, but it also attempts to include members of unions who contributed individually, either on top of or in lieu of their union dues. It also includes ""union"" contributions that are made to candidates from a separate political fund that members participate in voluntarily, said Doug Martin, lobbyist and political director the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees in Florida.

The biggest union contributor was the Florida Education Association, which spent $4.1 million in 2010 ($3.5 million of it on Democrats).

As its name suggests, the National Institute on Money in State Politics only covers state races and does not cover races for the U.S. House or U.S. Senate. We were not able to find as good a way to track donations to Florida Democrats in federal races.

The Center for Responsive Politics reported that during the 2009-2010 federal campaign season, Democratic candidates in Florida received a total $35.9 million (compared to $48.7 million for Republicans). But the center doesn't parse out donations to political party by sector.

We were able to examine a few specific candidates, including the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in 2010, Kendrick Meek, who raised about $9 million. According to the center, lawyers and law firms contributed more to Meek than any other industry, about $1 million.

The ""education"" industry, which would include education unions, contributed about $106,000. Building trade unions contributed an additional $75,000. 
Ron Klein, who raised around $4 million in his unsuccessful attempt to win re-election to the U.S. House, received $75,000 from public-sector unions, $67,000 from public trade unions and about $50,000 from transportation unions.

In both cases, not chump change. But hardly half of what the candidates raised.

Norquist said union dues fund half of Democratic campaigns in Florida. While unions predominantly donate to Democrats, according to research from the National Institute on Money in State Politics, there's no evidence union dues fund anywhere close to half of state Democratic campaigns. About 11 percent of all contributions to state-level Democrats came from unions and their members, but not even all of that came from dues. Some of the contributions are made individually by members. Others are pooled through voluntary political action committees.

On collective bargaining, Stone's votes were consistent but explanations varied
","
State Rep. Jeff Stone’s path to keeping the Milwaukee County executive’s job in Republican hands became a bumpy one when massive protests greeted Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to sharply curtail collective bargaining rights for public employees.

Stone supported Walker’s move in two Assembly votes, but his comments in between those votes drew criticism from opponent Chris Abele, who said Stone, R-Greendale, was trying to have it both ways.

That means it’s time to roll out the Flip-O-Meter, which measures whether politicians have changed their position on key issues. Here’s our standard disclaimer: We’re not evaluating whether it was good or bad policy -- or politics -- to shift, just to what degree a shift occurred.

Let’s start back in February.

At a Feb. 11, 2011, news conference in Madison, Stone joined a small group who stood with Walker as the governor unveiled his budget-repair bill. The plan included the collective bargaining changes imposed new pension and health care contributions on workers.

On Feb. 22, 2011, amid the Capitol protests, Stone argued against changes in Walker’s budget-repair bill, which he termed a difficult but reasonable step to solving deficits of $130 million in the budget year that ends June 30, 2011, and more than $3 billion for the next two years.

""I don't think we can solve this problem by going part way with this bill,"" he said in lengthy remarks during the Assembly floor debate.

He backed his words with his votes: Stone voted against dozens of Democratic amendments during the long debate on the bill, including ones that would have preserved the current collective bargaining setup.

So, no change in position there.

Ten days later, wearing his other hat as a candidate to succeed Walker as Milwaukee County executive, Stone took a different tack.

He told a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter he would have taken a different approach to the budget than limiting collective bargaining and signaled he would have supported the budget bill without the provisions.

""I understand it's a major issue to the unions,"" Stone said in the story. ""It's not necessarily the way I would have drafted this budget-repair bill. I would have approached it in different ways.""

""Those weren’t elements that had to be included for me to support this bill,"" Stone said, according to the reporter’s notes. ""I didn’t think they were necessary for me to make the (pension and health) changes in Milwaukee County.""

Stone, the Journal Sentinel story reported, emphasized that he felt the other provisions in the measure made the repair bill worth supporting.

So Stone had voted against amendments that would have kept the bargaining rights intact -- but said soon after that he would have been willing to support a version that kept the bargaining rights intact.

Was he doing one thing and saying another?

It was those remarks that touched off partisan charges of double-speak and flip-flopping.

They also drew some skeptical attention from a conservative Walker campaign supporter who backs the governor’s plans regarding unions.

WTMJ-AM (620) talk show host Charlie Sykes asked Stone during his March 8, 2011, show to explain his position in light of his remarks to the newspaper.

""I’m confused,"" Sykes told candidate Stone.

Stone said he was ""confused"" about the story but did not suggest it was wrong. He said he was trying to draw a contrast between his views and those of Walker.

He repeated his position that there were things he ""might have approached differently"" on bargaining.

But moments later he tacked again, offering an unequivocal defense of Walker’s plan.

""I support what’s in the bill,"" Stone said. ""I support what Gov. Walker has proposed. I support the requirements there as far as the votes that are in the bill.""

On the same day, Stone’s office tried to remove all doubt, quoting Stone in a news release as saying: ""My position on collective bargaining for public employees is this; the current practice needs to be ended.""

The Assembly gave the bill final passage on March 10 -- a scaled-down version that nevertheless kept intact all the collective bargaining restrictions.

We turned to Stone to explain his shifting statements.

He did not challenge that he told the Journal Sentinel he would have excluded the bargaining limits. He acknowledged that people could read into his remarks that he was against the move.

Stone said he erred when he said that he would have written the bill differently. He said he underestimated the size of the state’s budget challenge, saying it became clear when Walker came out with his two-year budget for 2011-’13, which is separate from the short-term budget-repair bill.

""I didn’t understand the budget situation,"" including how deep the cuts would be if the bargaining changes were not made, Stone said.

But Walker’s budget was introduced two days before Stone made his remarks to the newspaper.

""I never flipped on the bill,"" Stone said. ""I voted for it both times.""

Stone’s right on that. But he has offered clearly inconsistent statements on his feelings on the most controversial aspect of the bill, appearing to want it both ways and changing rhetorical course several times. On the Flip-O-Meter, here is the definition for a Half Flip: ""A partial change of position or inconsistent statements.""

That’s what fits here.",/factchecks/2011/mar/25/jeff-stone/collective-bargaining-stones-votes-were-consistent/
"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Nathan Deal']","
Deal says HOPE helped universities become some of the ""best in the Southeast""
","
Georgia bid to keep HOPE alive by cutting it. 

There was no choice, Gov. Nathan Deal said. He could either trim the popular college scholarship program or let it go bust, he wrote in an op-ed published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 

Letting HOPE die was not an option. He signed cuts into law March 15.  

""This program has helped turn our University System into one of the best in the Southeast, with two institutions ranked in the top 20 of public universities in the country,"" he wrote March 21. 

This claim made PolitiFact Georgia reporters curious. HOPE has been credited with a lot of things. But improving the University System of Georgia? That was news to us. We checked this claim out. 

HOPE awarded its first scholarship in 1993. Until recently, it gave full tuition at Georgia’s public colleges to students who graduated from high school with at least a 3.0 grade-point average -- so long as they maintained that average in college.  

Under ""Enduring HOPE,"" the revamped program, only the state’s top students will receive full tuition, and they must maintain a 3.3 in college to keep the award. Students with at least a 3.0 will still get HOPE, but the amount will vary each year. 

A Deal spokeswoman told us that the governor’s op-ed referred to U.S. News and World Report rankings for the Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Georgia. Sure enough, Georgia Tech ranks seventh among public universities. UGA is 18th. 

In 1997, Georgia Tech ranked ninth. The University of Georgia didn’t crack the top 25. 

But has HOPE helped that happen? And does a rankings jump really mean HOPE helped turned Georgia’s University System into one of the ""best in the Southeast""? 

College rankings, such as the ones from U.S. News, are regularly criticized by educators who think they are a poor measure of a school’s quality. They argue that the numbers say little about how well colleges educate their students and put pressure on administrators to game their numbers. 

Still, if UGA’s and Georgia Tech’s rankings are rising, something good is going on, right? 

We reviewed studies on the topic and talked to experts on merit-based scholarship programs such as HOPE. They agreed that Georgia’s program encouraged better-performing high school students who might have left the state to stay.  

For instance, a study found that in 1993, only 23 percent of Georgia’s high school graduates with SAT scores that topped 1500 stayed in state. By April 2002, 76 percent stayed.

And while Georgia high school seniors’ SAT scores grew by only 30 points from HOPE’s start through 2005, the scores of the state’s college freshmen jumped by 60 points.

This dramatic change helped rankings at top Georgia schools, especially UGA, rise. ""Student selectivity"" makes up 15 percent of a school’s U.S. News ranking. This measure includes students’ SAT and ACT scores, class rank and what proportion of applicants a university turns away.  

Other factors have boosted the rankings of Georgia’s top schools as well. 

Nationwide, research shows that the cost of higher education has climbed so high that high-performing students who would have only considered private schools are looking at top state schools, said Donald E. Heller, a professor of education at Pennsylvania State University who has studied HOPE. Also, flagship schools are working harder to recruit talent from other states. Those students tend to have higher scores and class rankings than in-state students. 

In addition, researchers have found that HOPE has negative effects. 

Because HOPE puts Georgia on the hook for college tuition, University System leaders have raised tuition rates at a much slower pace than schools in surrounding states, said David B. Mustard, a UGA economist who has been involved in a half-dozen studies that analyze the program’s effects. 

This helps state coffers, but over time, it hurts a university’s ability to retain high-quality staff and keep low student-to-teacher ratios, Mustard and other researchers have found. Between 1993 and 2002, the number of faculty focusing on teaching fell in Georgia’s research universities by 3.2 percent and at two-year colleges by 23.2 percent. Meanwhile, enrollment grew. 

And while HOPE may help students pay for school, it did not make them more diligent.  Research comparing recipients with out-of-state students found that to maintain the required 3.0 GPA, HOPE scholars took easier course loads, withdrew from more classes or enrolled more frequently in summer school, where it’s easier to get higher grades. 

To sum up: 

Rankings aren’t complete measures of a school’s quality. But as Deal said, HOPE did help Georgia’s top schools improve their rankings because it encouraged higher-caliber students to stay in state. 

The downside is fewer faculty are teaching more students, and HOPE students are taking easier or fewer courses. 

Deal is correct, but his statement could use more context. We rate his claim Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2011/mar/25/nathan-deal/deal-says-hope-helped-universities-become-some-bes/

State Rep. Armond Budish says pending legislation would limit or eliminate 'time-and-a-half' overtime pay
","
Ohio House Democratic Leader Armond Budish has vowed to ""fight like hell"" against the plan to narrow public workers’ collective bargaining rights, known as Senate Bill 5.

Behind the tough talk is a strategy to enlist more than the union workers who have become the face of the SB 5 opposition. Budish and Democrats want all middle-class, working Ohioans to join the fight.

Budish’s message to recruits: Republicans are engaged in a full-scale war against the middle class. The Beachwood Democrat issued a warning in a letter to The Plain Dealer published March 17.

""For example, legislation pending in the House would effectively limit or eliminate ‘time-and-a-half’ for people who work overtime.""

Budish’s claim piqued PolitiFact Ohio’s interest because time-and-a-half has been a standard pay scale for overtime work for decades.

The legislation Budish referenced is House Bill 61, which two Republicans introduced in January. A House committee recommended the bill for approval earlier this month, although all Democrats on the committee voted against it. The bill has not been up for a full floor vote yet.

The pending legislation would allow certain workers to receive one hour of compensatory time – paid time off – rather than overtime wages for each hour worked exceeding 40 in a week.

Federal and state labor laws require most employers pay time-and-a-half for overtime.
HB 61 would allow workers to accumulate up to 240 hours of comp time. At the end of a year, employers would have to pay overtime wages for any unused comp time.

There are two key issues in Budish’s claim.
  
Let’s start with the second issue.

HB61 would cover private employers (with some exceptions) with annual gross sales between $150,000 and $500,000, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission.

About 10,000 members of the Ohio chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business have self-reported gross receipts between $100,000 and $500,000, said Chris Ferruso, legislative director for the organization.

Businesses with sales above $500,000 already must comply with federal overtime laws.

""A lot of this is aimed at very small businesses,"" said Tony Seegers, director of Labor and Human Resources Policy for the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. ""It’s not going to be a lot of employers, but it’s going to be some of the smaller ones.""

The Ohio Chamber of Commerce and the Ohio NFIB support HB 61.

As  for the first issue, HB 61 supporters note that workers would get to chose between comp time and overtime pay. The bill says employers cannot require workers to take comp time. And workers are supposed to initiate the exchange for comp time. The bill also bars employers from threatening, intimidating or firing workers who want overtime wages.

Columbus attorney Fred Gittes called the voluntary nature of the bill ""a charade.""
Gittes’ argument speaks to the core of Budish’s claim that the bill ""would effectively limit or eliminate"" time-and-a-half pay for overtime work.

Gittes argues that employers could force their workers to take comp time instead of overtime because the bill lacks teeth to discourage the from doing so. He testified against the bill on behalf of the Ohio Employment Lawyers Association.

Employers would have a financial motivation to press workers to take comp time. Comp time would be awarded on a one-to-one ratio for extra hours worked. An employee who worked two extra hours, for example, would get two hours of comp time. That’s a cheaper arrangement than paying time-and-a-half for each overtime hour worked.

Gittes argues that the penalties are too weak for employers who break the rules.

The bill has no provisions to help a worker get his job back or to recover lost wages. Instead, employers who force workers to take comp time would be fined double the worker’s hourly wage for the number of comp time hours involved in the violation, plus attorney fees and court costs.

Federal overtime laws include employer penalties that allow a worker to regain their job and wages lost from the time of their firing. Gittes said he has discussed with the bill’s sponsors the inclusion of such language, but it has not been added.

The monetary difference resulting from stiffer penalties could be vast.

Take, for example, the case of a worker with a $10 per hour wage who was fired for refusing to accept 200 hours in comp time.

If the worker prevailed in court, under HB 61, he would be awarded about $4,000.

If the same worker won a lawsuit under federal labor laws, he could win his job back and wages covering those that were lost from the point of termination.

""What employer will continue to pay time-and-a-half for each hour of overtime if they can effectively force employees to agree to take comp time at their normal rate of pay?"" Gittes said in his testimony to the House Small Business and Economic Development Committee.

Forbes says Army training program listed evangelical Christians and al-Qaida as extremists
","
During a recent budget hearing of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Randy Forbes, R-4th, accused the Obama administration of waging war against religious expression in the military. 
""I believe the impact of this administration’s fiscal cuts to our national security are unwise and will have long-lasting repercussions,"" he told U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel on April 11. 
""But I also believe this administration’s attacks on faith, religious freedom and religious liberty in the military are also unwise and will have long-lasting repercussions,"" the congressman said. 
Forbes, who is founder and chairman of the 94-member Congressional Prayer Caucus, cited several examples that have convinced him religious expression by service members is being suppressed. One, in particular, stood out. 
 ""We’ve had a training program, which I have given you a copy of, where we list evangelical Christians, Catholics and Mormons in the same category of religious extremism as we do al-Qaida,"" Forbes told Hagel. 
The statement gained Forbes interviews on WAVY-TV10 in Norfolk and on Fox News, which put up a screen headline saying, ""Military calls evangelicals ‘terrorists.’"" So we decided to check whether the armed forces had such a training program. 
Sergio Gor, Forbes’ spokesman, sent us news stories that ran around April 5 in The Washington Times, The Daily Mail in London, The Navy News and the Catholic News Agency. They concerned an offensive computer slide on Page 24 of a U.S. Army Reserve training presentation titled ""Extremism and Extremist Organizations."" 
Gor also sent us a picture of the slide, which in blue capital letters at the top, is titled ""Religious Extremism."" Seventeen groups are listed underneath. Evangelical Christianity topped the list, followed by Muslim Brotherhood, the most powerful political group in Egypt. Beside each listing, the slide notes the nation and the religion that spawns the supposedly extremist group. 
The list includes Catholicism, ultra-orthodox Judaism and Sunni Islam in addition to the Ku Klux Klan and several groups that are recognized as terrorist organizations by the U.S. State Department: al-Qaida, Hamas in Palestine, Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines and the Kahane movement in Israel. 
Contrary to Forbes’ statement, mainstream Mormons are not cited for extremism. But a split-off polygamist sect, the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, is. 
Forbes, at the hearing and in TV interviews, gave the impression that the training materials were widely used and sanctioned by the Army. He told Fox News, ""They’re training troops before the go to Afghanistan, and they were training them that evangelical Christians, Catholics and Mormons were in the same category with Hamas, al-Qaida and the Ku Klux Klan, and that’s just appalling."" 
But there’s another side to this story that Forbes didn’t mention, a part that was well-documented in the news stories his office sent to us. 
The offending slide was used a year ago at a briefing held for an Army Reserves Unit in Pennsylvania. An Army spokesman said the person who created and presented the slideshow, whom the service will not identify by name, was not a ""subject matter expert."" 
The Army said the presenter, upon receiving a single complaint, apologized and deleted the slide. ""The slide was not produced by the Army and certainly does not reflect our policy or doctrine,"" the Army said in a statement. ""It was produced without anyone in the chain of command’s knowledge or permission."" 
The Archdiocese for the Military Services released a statement April 4 saying it was ""astounded that Catholics were listed alongside groups that are, by their very mission and nature, violent and extremist."" 
The Archdiocese also said the training ""appears to be an isolated incident not condoned by the Department of the Army."" It called on the Defense Department to ""ensure that taxpayer funds are never again used to present blatantly anti-religious material to the men and women in uniform."" 
Our ruling 
Forbes, at a military budget hearing, said ""We’ve had a training program ... where we list evangelical Christians, Catholics and Mormons in the same category of religious extremism as we do al-Qaida."" 
This did happen in at least one briefing at a reserve center in Pennsylvania. The Army says it was a mistake -- made by an individual, not the command -- that was corrected upon the first complaint. Forbes, while offering no contrary information, made sweeping statements that suggest the training program was widespread and officially sanctioned. He also misread one entry on the list as Mormons, when, in fact, it named a small sect that practices polygamy. 
Forbes’ statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That makes it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/may/03/randy-forbes/forbes-says-army-training-program-listed-evangelic/

Ed FitzGerald says people are working longer hours and bringing home smaller paychecks
","
Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald formally announced his candidacy for governor last month, kicking off his campaign with speeches in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. 
The Democrat, taking aim at the man he hopes to unseat next year, portrayed Republican Gov. John Kasich as a politician whose policies hurt middle-class Ohioans. 
""Just about everyone everywhere is spending more hours on the job, less time with their families, bringing home smaller and smaller paychecks, while they're paying more and more at the gas pump and the grocery stores,"" FitzGerald told supporters. 
PolitiFact Ohio wondered about the basis for the statement and asked for sources. 
For the claim about ""more hours on the job, less time with their families,"" FitzGerald's staff cited data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
According to its American Time Use Survey, the average employed American spent an average of 7.6 hours per day working on days that they worked in 2011, the most recent year available. That's an increase from 7.48 hours in 2010. 
They also cited an article from the news service The Fiscal Times that reported Americans are logging in more time at work, skipping vacation time and increasingly handling work-related email on vacation and weekend time. 
As for the ""smaller paychecks,"" FitzGerald's camp said that ""the real hourly wages of Ohio workers have failed to keep pace with inflation"" since 2010, decreasing the salaries of workers in inflation-adjusted dollars. 
Their source was the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Its data show that the mean and median hourly wages of Ohioans rose from $19.66 and $15.45 in 2010 to $20.52 and $16.03 in 2012. 
When adjusted for inflation and measured in current dollars, however, using the CPI inflation calculator, mean and median hourly wages fell from $20.99 and $16.49 in 2010 to $20.52 and $16.25 in 2012. 
PolitiFact has always stipulated that the ability of an individual governor to influence the economy is limited. Determining how credit or blame should be apportioned is seldom clear. 
We did not assign credit to Kasich for his statement in March that Ohioans' wages have risen by more than $10 billion since 2010. But we rated the statement as True. 
We can't rate FitzGerald's linking of Kasich to his statement about people spending more hours on the job and bringing home smaller paychecks. 
But his statement is accurate, with the point of clarification that ""smaller paychecks"" are in inflation-adjusted current dollars. 
Because that additional information is needed, we rate the statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/may/03/ed-fitzgerald/ed-fitzgerald-says-people-are-working-longer-hours/

Graham points to hard-to-fill jobs in immigration debate
","
Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is a member of the bipartisan Gang of Eight senators pushing for comprehensive immigration reform. 
Graham has repeatedly used his state’s labor issues to justify guest worker programs for low-skilled and agricultural workers. 
""Nobody wants to displace a willing American worker, but I can tell you in South Carolina there are certain jobs, like in the meatpacking industry, that as an employer you can advertise all day long every day of the week and you’re not going to get that workforce,"" Graham said during a February 2013 Senate hearing. 
The senator made similar comments to a South Carolina Rotary Club. ""When you go to these meatpacking plants in Saluda (S.C.), harvesting the crops or servicing the hotels along the coast, you may not believe it, but it is true -- there is a shortage of labor in some parts of our economy, even though we have high unemployment,"" Graham said. 
We wanted to know whether Graham’s comments about a labor shortage in some areas were correct. 
South Carolina’s jobless rate is higher than the national rate. That state and Georgia’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 8.4 percent in March. The national rate was 7.6 percent. 
So why would jobs go unfilled? The issue may be one of wages, not workers, said Steve Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration. 
""Real wages in meat/poultry processing have declined about 40 percent in the last 30 years. These are not the lowest-paying jobs, but they are nasty, not pleasant work,"" he said. ""If the job pays dramatically less than it previously did, that means there is a wage issue and not a jobs issue."" 
The national average hourly wage for slaughterers and meatpackers was $11.99 in May 2012. In South Carolina, the average hourly wage was $11.36. In 2010, the national hourly wage for the job was $11.55; South Carolina’s wage was $8.81. 
Because of the nature of the work and the pay, the jobs may not attract enough applicants, said Mark Grey, an anthropology professor and director of the Iowa Center for Immigrant Leadership and Integration. The nonprofit, nonpartisan center at the University of Northern Iowa notes that its programs incorporate ""a strong appreciation for the critical role newcomers play"" in the state’s economy. 
""(Meatpacking) wages have increased, but still at $16 per hour (on the high end), the job would probably not be appealing to anybody with any kind of education,"" he said. 
In Saluda County, S.C. -- the area mentioned by Graham -- the unemployment rate for residents with less than a high school diploma was 19.1 percent in 2011, the most recent federal data available. The rate dropped to 10.9 percent for high school graduates with no college. Statewide unemployment that year was 10.5 percent. 
To sum up, research shows that South Carolina’s unemployment is almost a full percentage point higher than the national average, and the rate for lower-educated residents is even higher. But in the meatpacking industry, the nature of the work and the wages often turn off many American workers, those on both sides of the immigration debate said. 

Graham said that there was a problem filling certain jobs, even amid high unemployment. But his statement lacks context about wages and conditions in the meatpacking industry. We rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/may/03/lindsey-graham/graham-points-hard-fill-jobs-immigration-debate/
"['Georgia', 'Immigration', 'Jobs', 'Dustin  Inman Society']","
Anti-amnesty group takes on Sen. Graham
","
The immigration debate is in high gear, prompting us to look into two claims on the issue. 
The most prominent driving force for reform has been the Gang of Eight, a bipartisan coalition of  U.S. senators -- four Republicans and four Democrats -- which released its comprehensive immigration reform bill last month. 
A key provision in the Senate bill (a House version could be a step-by-step approach still to come) would create guest worker programs for low-skilled and agricultural workers. 
Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is a proponent of the programs. But that advocacy didn’t go over so well here in Georgia with an anti-amnesty group, the Dustin Inman Society, which purchased a billboard advertisement criticizing Graham. 
The billboard, posted in Cherokee County near Woodstock, reads: ""South Carolina Welcomes the Undocumented! Sen. Lindsey Graham says his state has a labor shortage and wants more immigrants."" The advertisement goes on to tell job seekers: ""For job tips, call his office (number provided) located in Pendleton, S.C., only two hours from Atlanta!"" 
The billboard ends with a link to a Patch article about Graham discussing immigration reform at a South Carolina Rotary Club meeting in February. 
We wanted to know if the ad correctly quoted Graham and accurately characterized his comments. 
We contacted D.A. King about the billboard. King is the leader of the Dustin Inman Society, named for the Georgia teenager killed in a 2000 traffic accident by an illegal immigrant. The billboard is in the county where Dustin Inman lived, King said. 
""Absent the (mainstream media) shining some honest light on the matter, we thought it would be educational and entertaining to at least illuminate his claims and perhaps encourage black market labor to migrate to South Carolina,"" King said in an email to us. ""That would open up jobs here (in Georgia) and help legal workers."" 
Graham, through a spokesman, said he had no comment on the billboard. 
In the Patch article referenced on the advertisement, Graham told the Rotary Club: ""When you go to these meatpacking plants in Saluda (S.C.), harvesting the crops or servicing the hotels along the coast, you may not believe it, but it is true -- there is a shortage of labor in some parts of our economy, even though we have high unemployment.""   
Graham also commented on the issue in a U.S. Senate hearing in February, and a portion of his remarks are included in a film by independent filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch, ""They Come to America II.""  The film, which is critical of Graham, says that 340,000 Americans in South Carolina can’t find full-time jobs. 
""Nobody wants to displace a willing American worker, but I can tell you in South Carolina there are certain jobs, like in the meatpacking industry, that as an employer you can advertise all day long every day of the week and you’re not going to get that workforce,"" Graham says during the hearing. 
So, Graham says his state has a labor shortage for certain jobs, and in the instances he’s made that claim, he has largely focused on the meatpacking industry. Neither the billboard nor a film criticizing Graham, though, notes that the senator’s comments referred mostly to the meatpacking industry. 
The billboard goes on to say that South Carolina welcomes the undocumented. Graham has advocated for a bill creating a guest worker program, but such a program would provide a legal means for some immigrants to work in the country.   
To sum up, a Georgia anti-amnesty group, the Dustin Inman Society, criticized Graham for his comments that the Palmetto State has a labor shortage. As part of his argument for comprehensive immigration reform and guest worker programs, Graham made claims there is a labor shortage in some areas, and in at least two instances the Republican senator specifically mentioned the meatpacking industry as an area needing workers. 

The claim about Graham’s statement contains an element of truth, but it ignores the senator’s focus on the meatpacking industry. The society goes on to say that Graham’s state welcomes undocumented immigrants, but the guest worker program he supports would create a legal means for immigrants to work.

Obama says people with health insurance ‘don’t have to worry’ about Obamacare rollout
","
Most Americans don’t need to worry about Obamacare ""glitches and bumps"" that may come next year, President Barack Obama says. 
All the parts of the health care law that affect them are already in place, and it’s all been good, he told reporters at a White House news conference on April 30, 2013. 
""For the average American out there, for the 85 to 90 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, this thing has already happened,"" he said. ""And their only impact is that their insurance is stronger, better and more secure than it was before. Full stop. That's it. They don't have to worry about anything else."" 
The president’s unequivocal language caught our eye. More than 20 provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to take effect. Are most folks — those who already have health insurance — in the clear? 
Experts told us the reality is somewhat more complex. 
‘A huge train wreck’ 
The president had been asked to respond to a recent comment from Sen. Max Baucus, a Democratic architect of the law, that rollout might be a ""a huge train wreck."" 
Baucus said at an April hearing that he was ""very concerned"" that not enough had been done to educate people about changes on the way. 
Big shifts include new state- and federal-run health insurance exchanges, rules about what policies on the exchanges must offer and a requirement that everyone have insurance. 
And those are just three of more than 20 provisions to take effect between now and 2018, according to a time line from the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent nonprofit group that’s closely followed the law. 
But Obama told reporters at his news conference that any ""implementation issues"" wouldn’t apply to the majority of Americans who already have health insurance. Instead, he clarified, they would affect only ""the small group of people … who don't have health insurance right now or are on the individual market and are paying exorbitant amounts for coverage that isn't that great."" 
In other words, he was already correcting himself. But did he go far enough? 
The ‘85 to 90 percent’ 
The president had offered blanket reassurance that ""the 85 to 90 percent of Americans who already have health insurance"" had nothing left to worry about. 
He’s right that about 85 percent of folks have some kind of health insurance, according to the most recent Census survey of health coverage. Nearly 16 percent said they didn’t have any coverage in 2011. 
Which means Obama was telling a fairly diverse group of people they had already experienced what the health care law had to offer them: Folks with health coverage through their employers (55 percent), through government programs such as Medicaid (17 percent) and Medicare (15 percent), through policies they buy themselves (10 percent) and through the military (4 percent). 
(Those numbers add up to more than 85 percent because the categories aren’t exclusive — some people have more than one kind of coverage.) 
‘Stronger, better and more secure’ 
For all of those people, Obama said, the ""only impact is that their insurance is stronger, better and more secure than it was before. Full stop. That's it."" 
There certainly have been helpful impacts: protection for people with pre-existing conditions, elimination of lifetime limits, coverage of 26-year-olds on their parents’ policies and no-fee preventive care. 
But those haven’t been the ""only"" impacts. 
""I think there's quite a bit more,"" said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute who has been a critic of the law. 
Some people who have insurance now may face: 
• Higher taxes 
• More comprehensive, and thus more expensive, policies 
• Employers who opt out, self-insure or move toward part-time employees 
• Health care providers who no longer take Medicaid or Medicare 
But those possibilities apply to small, specific groups of people — or it’s not yet clear how widespread they may be. 
Higher taxes, for example, include new restrictions on tax-free health accounts, a higher threshold for deducting unreimbursed medical expenses and a higher Medicare Part A insurance tax for high-income families. 
Then there are higher taxes on pharmaceutical manufacturers, health insurers and employers — costs which may be passed on to consumers. 
""People will feel those effects as well,"" said Gail Wilensky, a health care analyst who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush. 
But recent headlines about higher premiums — such as a request for a 25 percent hike by a Maryland insurer and a recent study showing underlying medical costs for individual policyholders may rise 32 percent — only apply to the individual market. That is, the less than 10 percent of people who buy their own insurance. 
Cheaper policies with fewer benefits — perhaps more than half of what’s offered on the individual market now — simply won’t be available on new insurance exchanges. But some people will qualify for new subsidies to offset higher premiums on their better, more expensive policies. 
Then there are anecdotal worries about employers opting out, self-insuring or moving toward part-time employees. 
But it’s hard to say how big the effect will be on currently insured workers, or which companies will follow through on their tests. Darden Restaurants, which infamously experimented with shifting more of its workers to part-time to avoid offering insurance, faced ""considerable backlash,"" according to NPR, and backed off. 
Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported that unions are pushing for federal subsidies to keep offering plans jointly with employers to some 20 million people, warning that they may drop coverage. 
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that employers will drop coverage for about 8 million people in 2019 — less than 3 percent of Americans — while people insured through exchanges will leap by 27 million. 
Meanwhile, Medicare savings under the health care law include reductions in payments for hospitals and nursing homes, which Medicare’s actuary has warned may make it hard for about 15 percent of them to stay profitable. Doctors have also had to fight off scheduled payment reductions, and some have limited their number of Medicare and Medicaid patients. 
""Medicare is in as much trouble as it ever was,"" said Mark Pauly, a professor of health care management, business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. 
In other words, at least some people with insurance now do face Obamacare implementation worries, as their employers and insurers grapple with how to adjust to changes under the law. 
But it’s not most people, Pauly and a few other experts told us. 
""I think the story isn't over yet, and there will be surprises and disruptions for some people, even if the overall impact is stronger, better and more secure,"" said Tim Jost, a health care expert at Washington and Lee University School of Law. 
Employees who get insurance through large employers, in particular, face the least uncertainty. 
""There isn't going to be a major financial impact on them,"" Jost said. ""And they'll have some benefit."" 
But Obama got into trouble by punctuating his point with phrases like the ""only impact,"" ""full stop"" and ""that’s it."" 
That’s just an exaggeration, Wilensky said. 
""He really put an exclamation point on it, which, yeah, doesn't hold,"" Tanner said. 
Our ruling 
Obama attempted to reassure Americans that for most of them, Obamacare ""has already happened."" He went on: ""And their only impact is that their insurance is stronger, better and more secure than it was before. Full stop. That's it. They don't have to worry about anything else."" He glossed over other impacts of the law, including higher taxes and in some cases, higher premiums. Meanwhile, some people who have insurance now will have to deal with changes from their employers, insurers and health care providers. Most people who have large-group coverage through their employers now face little change, experts told us. So for many of those people, Obama was largely correct.

Wayne Smith says science has not shown greenhouse gases to be a problem
","Wayne Smith does not sweat greenhouse gases.

""Science has not shown greenhouse gases to be a problem,"" the Republican Baytown state representative told the Austin American-Statesman for a news article posted online April 17, 2013.

Smith, who seeks legislative approval of a proposal to have the state issue permits for such industrial emissions, also said that nevertheless, ""there’s no need to regulate greenhouse gases."" House members sent his proposal to the Senate that week.

We explored whether science has not shown greenhouse gases--meaning various gaseous compounds (such as carbon dioxide) that absorb infrared radiation, trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to the greenhouse effect--to be a problem.

Smith, who represents a district that is home to petrochemical plants, did not respond to telephone inquiries, but we ran his claim by Paul C. ""Chip"" Knappenberger, assistant director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, which might be philosophically compatible with the Texan.

By phone, Knappenberger said the effects of greenhouse gases on climate change are scientifically proven.

But whether that’s a problem, he said, is ""open-ended. If you define all change as a problem, then you have a problem. How much of a problem it is depends on how fast and how large the climate change is that results.""

Knappenberger also pointed out articles he wrote in February and March 2013 suggesting fresh research indicates the generally predicted pace of warming may be overstated. ""I am not convinced that the pace of global warming is sufficient enough to make greenhouse gas emissions a ‘problem,’"" Knappenberger emailed.

Separately, several experts including the Texas state climatologist, John Nielsen-Gammon, told us the scientific consensus is that increases in greenhouse gases, mostly due to burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil, have been contributing to global warming, though the pace of that warming is uncertain.

Naomi Oreskes, a professor of history at the University of California, San Diego, sent us a chapter of a pending book updating her 2004 look into scientific consensus about climate change. A portion of the chapter says: ""Scientists predicted a long time ago that increasing greenhouse gas emissions could change the climate, and now there is overwhelming evidence that it is changing the climate."" However, ""to say that man-made global warming is underway is not the same as agreeing about what will happen in the future. Much of the continuing debate in the scientific community involves the likely rate of future change. ""

""There are climate scientists who actively do research in the field but disagree with the consensus position,"" the chapter later says, ""but their number is very, very small.""

By phone, Nielsen-Gammon said a helpful indicator of the scientific consensus is the latest assessment of global warming factors, published in 2007 by the International Panel on Climate Change. That body was created in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environmental Programme to evaluate the state of climate science as a basis for informed policy action, primarily on the basis of peer-reviewed and published scientific literature, Oreskes has noted.

The 2007 report says both that evidence of global warming is ""unequivocal"" and that most ""of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.""

In the United States by itself, Nielsen-Gammon pointed out, the National Research Council, which is among a few independent, nonprofit U.S. institutions that provide science, technology, and health policy advice under a congressional charter, issued an analysis in May 2011. A press release summarizing that work opens: ""Warning that the risk of dangerous climate change impacts is growing with every ton of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere, a"" council ""committee today reiterated the pressing need for substantial action to limit the magnitude of climate change and to prepare to adapt to its impacts.""

Separately, an online search led us to a survey of scientists, published in 2009, that initially asked more than 10,000 earth scientists to participate. Among 3,146 respondents asked if they think ""human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures,"" 82 percent answered affirmatively, with 97 pecent of those respondents with the most climate expertise saying yes.

The article, whose lead author was Peter T. Doran, a professor of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago, closes: ""It seems that the debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long-term climate processes. The challenge, rather, appears to be how to effectively communicate this fact to policy makers and to a public that continues to mistakenly perceive debate among scientists.""

Similarly, Oreskes said by email, the National Academy of Sciences published the results of a survey of about 900 ""actively publishing"" climate scientists in 2010, finding that 97 percent of the scientists agreed with the ""tenets of anthropogenic climate change,"" meaning human contributions to warming.

Oreskes told us by email: ""The conclusion that humans have contributed to global warming cannot be separated from the role of greenhouse gases  produced by burning fossil fuels. To separate human activities from greenhouse gases is a false dichotomy. Increased greenhouse gases are a direct result of human activities, mainly burning fossil fuels. The scientific conclusion is that ‘most’ of the observed warming of the past 50 years is very likely to be due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, caused by burning fossil fuels. Most of the rest has been caused by deforestation.  Both are human activities, and both are a problem, because they drive adverse impacts like heat waves and droughts.""   

A speculation: Perhaps Smith concedes that greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, but maintains that warming itself is not a problem.

Besides, should his claim be laid aside because any definition of ""problem"" invokes personal judgment?

Scientists see that point, but...

Oreskes said by email: ""Of course, the word ‘problem’ is subjective, but insofar as one can say that there is evidence that bears on the issue, the scientific community has amply supplied that evidence."" By telephone and email, Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at  Texas Tech University, said she considers greenhouse gases a very expensive problem because western civilization has been built on the premise of a stable climate. Burning fossil fuels, she said, has fed the greenhouse effect.

Our ruling

Smith said science has not shown greenhouse gases to be a problem.

But scientists have agreed for years that such gases contribute to atmospheric changes driving climatic warming, which is characterized as a global threat.

We considered the idea that the legislator’s reference to greenhouse gases as a ""problem"" reflects an uncheckable judgment, a matter of opinion. However, our sense is that his statement purported to reflect scientific consensus--and by that yardstick, it is both incorrect and ridiculous.

We rate the claim as Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2013/may/02/wayne-smith/wayne-smith-says-science-has-not-shown-greenhouse-/

Leonard Lance claims federal tax code contains 4 million words, is 7 times as long as Bible
","
The U.S. Internal Revenue code may make War and Peace read like a novella. 
That’s how onerous and confounding the nation’s tax code is, according to Rep. Leonard Lance (R-7th), who issued a news release April 15 calling for ""meaningful tax reform"" and blasting the complexity of the tax code. 
""The Internal Revenue code has ballooned to a 5,600-page, 4 million-word complicated mess that is seven times as long as the Bible with none of the good news,"" Lance said in the news release. 
But not all the news is bad for Lance. 
Let’s first review the size of the tax code and then compare that with the size of the Bible. 
A 2010 report by the Internal Revenue Service’s Taxpayer’s Advocate Office found that the tax code contained 3.8 million words. That calculation was made by downloading a zipped file of the code, unzipping it and running it through Microsoft Word’s word-count feature, according to a footnote in the report. A 2012 version of the report puts the number of words in the code at ‘about 4 million.’ 
We also reached out to CCH, the Riverwoods, Ill.-based publisher of the two-volume 2013 Winter version of the tax  code and was told the best estimate of word length was 4 million. CCH is a Wolters Kluwer business. 
So Lance’s claim about the number of words is generally accurate. 
Next, let’s look at number of pages. Lance said 5,600, based on the same figure cited by articles in the Washington Post, the Harvard Business Review and other publications, according to Todd Mitchell, Lance’s chief of staff. 
Mark Luscombe, a principal federal tax analyst for CCH, said the publisher’s version of the tax code is 5,036 pages. 
""Private publishers do a print version of the Internal Revenue code, but then you’re looking at one private publisher’s version of the code,"" he said. ""We do it in two volumes and we keep condensing it."" 
The key point here? Letter size, font and spacing matter when counting pages in the tax code and even in the Bible. 
Dennis Olson, the Charles T. Haley professor of Old Testament Theology at the Princeton Theological Seminary said an approximation of 800,000 words for the Old and New testaments combined is fair. 
""The King James Version would be 823,156 while the more recent New Revised Standard Version would be 774,746 words,"" Olson said in an e-mail. 
Hellen Mardaga, an assistant professor of New Testament at Catholic University in Washington, said there’s no standard way to measure the size of the Bible, given its numerous translations and texts but said she, too, was aware of estimates that put the Bible at 800,000 words. 
Mardaga also noted that dividing 4 million – the number of words in the tax code – by 800,000 - would mean the tax code is five times longer than the Bible -- not Lance’s seven. 
We looked at versions of the King James and New American Standard versions of the Bible on Amazon.com, an online retailer of books and other merchandise. The four Bibles we looked at ranged in size from 512 pages to 1,112. Accordingly, Mitchell said he has seen numerous references comparing the size of the tax code with the Bible, ranging from 4 times as long to 10 times as long. Seven, he said, is in the middle. 
""It all depends on what version (of the Bible) you have in front of you,"" he said. ""I’m not sure there’s a right or wrong answer to the question."" 
Our ruling 
Lance said, ""The Internal Revenue code has ballooned to a 5,600-page, 4 million-word complicated mess that is seven times as long as the Bible with none of the good news."" 
It’s generally accepted that the code is about 4 million words in length, according to previous published reports and the publisher of the 2013 winter version of the tax code. Lance also based his figure of 5,600 pages on previous reports from publications such as the Harvard Business Review. Opinions also differ on the code’s length when compared with the Bible, given the many versions, translations and texts of it. And while the tax code isn’t seven times as long as the Bible, even given a standard word count for the good book, we get Lance’s overall point: the tax code is long and complex. We rate his claim Mostly True.

Ed FitzGerald accuses Gov. John Kasich of pay-to-play politics
","
The 2014 race for governor is off to a punchy start. 
PolitiFact Ohio told you Wednesday about the early attacks that Republican allies of incumbent John Kasich hope will stick against his likely Democratic challenger, Ed FitzGerald. 
Essentially, the GOP has seized on FitzGerald’s bystander status in the federal investigation of Cuyahoga County government and wrongly branded the first-term county executive as corrupt. It’s an attack that cuts directly at FitzGerald’s efforts to project a law-and-order image. 
But FitzGerald is using similar rhetoric in his attempt to draw contrasts with Kasich. 
""We need a governor who will stand up for middle-class families, for women’s rights and for good paying jobs,"" FitzGerald wrote last month when inviting supporters to his campaign kickoffs in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. ""Ohioans want an end to pay-to-play politics, rampant cronyism and wasteful spending of our tax dollars on corporate donors and political perks."" 
Jon Thompson, a spokesman for the Republican Governors Association, pointed to that statement this week as PolitiFact Ohio was evaluating his group’s claim that FitzGerald, the former mayor of Lakewood, represented a ""brand of pay-to-play and corruption politics."" 
The he-started-it defense is not acceptable when dealing with dishonesty. The RGA statement earned a Pants On Fire rating on our Truth-O-Meter. But what’s good for the goose is good for the gander, so PolitiFact Ohio today is taking a closer look at FitzGerald’s ""pay-to-play"" claim. 
We asked Meredith Tucker, spokeswoman for FitzGerald’s campaign, to clarify what, specifically, FitzGerald meant by talking of pay-to-play politics involving Kasich. She responded with a 12-page memo with a table of contents that offered six examples. None, though, is a case in which the governor himself is accused of seeking or providing a favor in exchange for another. 
Most of the examples involve Kasich administration officials or political allies. And while a few raise obvious ethics questions, they do not fit the pay-to-play description in the classic sense. One example FitzGerald’s campaign cites is merely a rehash of the controversy surrounding Kasich’s JobsOhio program, which is not subject to any substantiated corruption claims. 
FitzGerald’s team fills three pages with quotes from newspapers that reported on how three members of Kasich’s inner circle emerged as top Statehouse lobbyists after Kasich took office. The FitzGerald document says the lobbyists ""cashed in on their relationship with the governor."" 
This cannot fairly be held as an example of pay-to-play. This the culture of Capitol Square. 
Lobbyists closely aligned with a particular party do better when that party is in power. The Plain Dealer’s Mark Naymik noted this in April 2007, when he reported that demand had surged for Democratic lobbyists after Democrat Ted Strickland’s election as governor. Naymik reported  in 2011 that the GOP sweep the previous fall had ushered in a new wave of Republican lobbyists. 
Another of FitzGerald’s examples focuses on Jim Leftwich, a former Kasich administration official who lost his development job with the state after it was learned he had a consulting contract with Wright State University. The Dayton Daily News covered the story extensively. Last November the newspaper reported it had obtained public records that showed Leftwich was on the state payroll when he and a WSU official devised a plan to give Leftwich’s firm ""a 25 percent ownership stake in start-up companies established based on the WSU-originated research."" 
Leftwich ""apparently … did not disclose"" this arrangement to his supervisors in state government -- something that state ethics rules would have required him to do, the Daily News reported. After Leftwich signed his WSU contract, Kasich, according to the newspaper, ""appointed him to the board for the Third Frontier program,"" a state program that invests in technology companies. 
Three weeks later, Leftwich suggested that ""WSU could use Third Frontier money to help launch two potential start-up businesses the university was working to create,"" the Daily News reported. 
The Kasich administration eventually learned about Leftwich’s dual roles, terminated him last fall and referred the case to the Ohio Ethics Commission. Paul Nick, the agency’s executive director, told PolitiFact Ohio this week that he ""cannot comment on an ongoing investigation."" 
                    
While ethically murky, this is a stretch as a pay-to-play example. 
FitzGerald’s campaign also singles out former Ohio Schools Superintendent Stan Heffner. The state inspector general last year found Heffner acted improperly by testifying in favor of a bill  that benefited a private education company he planned to work for, The Plain Dealer reported. 
The FitzGerald memo blasts Kasich for opposing Heffner’s firing. The governor’s spokesman told The Plain Dealer at the time that Heffner exercised bad judgment but that Kasich believed dismissal ""seems too far."" Heffner resigned two days later, a move Kasich said was appropriate. 
Prosecutors in Franklin County and Columbus ruled that Heffner’s actions were not criminal. 
Conflict of interest involving the state schools chief? Yes. 
Pay-to-play politics involving the governor? No. 
The final two examples FitzGerald offers relate to the governor’s control over the Ohio GOP. 
Last year Andrew Manning, the former chairman of the Portage County Republican Party, accused Kasich allies of offering him influence in the governor’s administration if he agreed not to run for a seat on the party’s State Central Committee. Team Kasich at the time wanted to dump Kevin DeWine as state party chairman and needed a majority of votes on the panel. 
Manning has said he met with FBI and sent the agency a sworn affidavit backing up his claims. But to date nothing has come of his accusations. Kasich’s allies have denied wrongdoing. 
This year Kasich endorsed Matt Borges, the state party’s executive director, to move up to the chairman’s post. Borges, who won the post last month, was dogged by a past guilty plea to unauthorized use of a public office. The 2004 misdemeanor involved Borges giving preferential treatment to certain brokers who donated to Ohio Treasurer Joe Deters’ re-election campaign. Borges paid a $1,000 fine and later cleared his record when he was granted an expungement. 
The Borges case is the only one cited in FitzGerald’s memo that is an actual example of a pay-to-play crime. And in this case Kasich has no connection to the crime, which since has been cleared from Borges’ record. FitzGerald resorts here to guilt by association. 
FitzGerald, in the invitation to his campaign kickoffs, contrasted himself with Kasich by asserting that Ohioans ""want an end to pay-to-play politics."" By doing so he characterizes the Kasich administration as corrupt. But he has no strong examples to back up this claim. 
PolitiFact Ohio applies the same threshold we applied when evaluating the Republican Governors Association’s effort to brand FitzGerald as corrupt. Kasich has never been accused of or charged with a crime, and FitzGerald lacks proof that he is even suspected of one. 
The GOP’s attack on FitzGerald was especially absurd given the fact that a federal prosecutor has publicly cleared the county executive of wrongdoing. FitzGerald walks a finer line by citing specific cases in which members of Kasich’s administration or political circle were accused of ethics violations and other uses of poor judgment -- but nothing that fits the ""pay-to-play"" label. 
As for Borges, had his misdemeanor come during Kasich’s term, FitzGerald might have a better argument. Instead, on the Truth-O-Meter, PolitiFact Ohio finds his statement False.",/factchecks/2013/may/02/ed-fitzgerald/ed-fitzgerald-accuses-gov-john-kasich-pay-play-pol/

Did Oregon rank No. 25 of 32 states in untreated decay in 2007?
","
Last week, PolitiFact Oregon heard an earful from fluoride opponents upset with our ruling on their claim that Multnomah County has the 15th lowest cavity rate in the country, as the county hovered at roughly the same percentage as the state of New York.  
We ruled the statement False because county data is not comparable to state data. Plus, we found that New York didn’t really rank 15th lowest because the cavity numbers posted on the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were from varying years and, consequently,  can’t be ranked.  
Accurate dental health statistics are critical because Portland residents will vote May 21, 2013, on whether to add fluoride to the city’s drinking water.  
For that fact check, we spoke with Shanie Mason, oral health program manager for the state agency that published the ""Smile Survey"" in 2002 and in 2007. Her office released a draft of the 2012 version last week at the request of The Oregonian. At the time, she cautioned against such comparisons and said, ""We have only compared ourselves against neighboring states with a similar methodology.""  
  
So imagine our surprise when we read this statement in the 2012 draft report: ""In 2007, Oregon scored worse in every major measure of oral health for children compared to 2002. At that time, Oregon ranked 25th – or 7th from the bottom – in percentage of children with untreated decay compared to 32 other states with similar data."" 
It’s accurate to say that Oregon measured worse in 2007 when compared to itself in 2002. However, the ""ranked"" numbers looked very much like the numbers erroneously relied on by anti-fluoride campaign Clean Water Portland -- which Mason cautioned against comparing -- when it made its claim about New York and Multnomah County.  
The CDC posts the percentage of third-graders with ""untreated decay."" But a spokeswoman for the CDC says the statistics are not meant to be ""ranked"" because they cover different time periods, with some as dated as 1999. The states have different response rates and vary in the percentage of children who qualify for free and reduced-price meals, she said.  
""There are many caveats in looking at these data across states,"" wrote Linda S. Orgain in yet another email to PolitiFact Oregon. ""These issues make ranking the states on these children's indicators less meaningful and probably not accurate. We would not recommend doing that.""   
We returned to the Oregon Health Authority for a response. Bruce Gutelius, who is presenting the 2012 survey, said in a reply email they wanted to provide context for Oregon’s numbers.  
He said they had other options -- for example, sticking with 2002 and 2007 Oregon figures, or measuring Oregon against a national figure from 1999-2004 -- but decided that a ranking ""was the most meaningful to provide the needed context.""  
  
We do not see how declaring Oregon No. 25 based on a list of percentages from other states and other years provides meaningful or accurate context. The percentage of third-graders in Oregon who showed evidence of untreated decay in 2006-07 was 35.4. Vermont was at 16.2 percent in 2002-03 and Arkansas was at 42.1 percent in 2001-02.  
The Smile Survey released last week contains numbers for children ages 6 to 9 -- so we’re talking largely kids in first, second and third grades. This is slightly different from the numbers reflected on the CDC website. In 2011-12, the percentage of children in this group who showed evidence of untreated tooth decay was 20 percent. In 2007 it was 36 percent. That’s a sizable decrease.  
This week, the Oregon Health Authority also shared statistics for 43 states, including numbers not yet posted to the CDC website. More than 21 percent of third-graders in Oregon and in Alabama have untreated decay for 2011-13. Oregon is in the middle of the pack if you look just at the percentages for the 43 states -- but again, we don’t know how some of the older numbers have shifted since then.  
We want the state to make recommendations on public health, even if controversial. The Oregon Health Authority has no official position on the city water measure, although public health officials there clearly favor fluoridating water. 
But we don’t think this was the most responsible way to put perspective on Oregon’s untreated decay percentages. The agency could have run in its 2007 report all the percentages for the 32 states, clearly citing the years and without designating a ranking. In its 2012 report, writers should have deleted the phrase: ""Oregon ranked 25th – or 7th from the bottom."" 
The statement is False. ",/factchecks/2013/may/02/oregon-health-authority/did-oregon-rank-no-25-32-states-untreated-decay-20/

Rick Scott says 'Every Florida teacher gets a pay raise' with new budget
","
Update: We updated this story to reflect updated budget proviso language that leaders agreed to May 1. These changes include removing the requirement that raises be delayed until June 2014 and giving boards the option to come up with their own merit-pay plans. 
Gov. Rick Scott declared ""victory"" after legislative leaders announced they included $480 million in the 2013-14 budget for teacher pay raises. 
Scott, who made a $2,500 pay raise for every teacher one of just two priorities this legislative session, announced the news on his Facebook page April 29: ""Our teachers are some of the best in the nation and they deserve to be rewarded for their great work. Today I am proud to announce that every Florida teacher gets a pay raise."" 
He included a photo of a male teacher with can’t-miss-it, all-caps text that reads ""EVERY FLORIDA TEACHER GETS A PAY RAISE! IT’S WORKING."" 
He’s over-simplifying it. The truth is, the Legislature’s offering of $480 million for raises may be in the amount Scott wanted, but he’s glossing over the fine print for how they want it spent. 
Earlier in the session, House and Senate leaders weren’t keen on Scott’s idea because it does not align with 2011 legislation they pitched and Scott signed implementing a merit pay system for teachers. But with a week left in session, leaders found a way to please both sides. 
Here are three details not included in Scott’s Facebook post, which last we checked had more than 2,400 likes: The raises would not be limited to just teachers. They are not immediate. And they are not a guarantee. 
You can find the conditions the Legislature placed in its bill implementing next year’s budget (page 21). 
House and Senate leadership agreed to allow for salary increases not only for school district and charter school classroom teachers, but for guidance counselors, social workers, psychologists, librarians, principals and assistant principals. 
The throng of education workers would not see an immediate raise. Initially, the budget was written so they would have to wait until June 2014 before getting a lump-sum payment for the 2013-14 school year. Hearing negative feedback on this provision, House and Senate changed this language so that school boards can distribute salary increases anytime before June 2014 ""as negotiated with collective bargaining units and educators."" 
But that’s if they qualify. The raises are based on merit. Lawmakers suggested school professionals be judged based on 2013-14 performance evaluations to be determined by school districts and approved by the state Department of Education. For education personnel deemed ""effective,"" lawmakers recommended salary increases of at least $2,500. Those rated ""highly effective"" are eligible for up to $3,500. 
New language that lawmakers added May 1 gives districts the options to come up with their own merit-pay plans, a move the FEA applauded. But there is still no mandate that every teacher get a raise. 
Factors that districts could use in their evaluations may include results on Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate assessments, as well as SAT, ACT, FCAT and end-of-course exam results. For those who don’t teach courses with standardized tests, districts will develop separate evaluation criteria. 
The Legislature took a different approach for state workers, awarding them $1,000 or $1,400 pay hikes (plus a chance for $600 more for some based on merit) depending on their income starting in October. Law enforcement officers would get their raise this summer. 
The caveats for teachers disappointed the Florida Education Association, which praised Scott for his efforts but dinged the Legislature for the strings attached, as well as Miami-Dade and Broward county superintendents Alberto Carvalho and Robert Runcie. The superintendents said they could not afford to give every teacher $2,500 on top of paying the ""unfunded mandate"" of raises for principals and staff. (Carvalho said the updated language is a positive move.) 
The South Florida superintendents said even though the Legislature will increase per-pupil funding by $1 billion statewide ($134 million for Miami-Dade and $93 million for Broward), there would still not be enough money to pay for raises, other benefits and healthcare, and other earmarks from the state, according to the Miami Herald. 
""The math simply does not add up,"" Runcie said. 
Based on the 2011-12 evaluations, just about every teacher would qualify for a raise. Of the teachers who were evaluated, 22.6 percent of teachers were highly effective and 74.6 percent were effective, leaving just under 3 percent of teachers with ratings of needs improvement or unsatisfactory. Ten percent of the state’s teachers were not evaluated. 
The numbers were similar for non-classroom personnel measured by merit pay, though 27.2 percent were not evaluated, according to Department of Education data. 
Even with the merit requirements, Scott spokeswoman Melissa Sellers said it’s not realistic to think unions and districts won’t try to get money to all teachers. The budget language is written flexibly enough so that districts are not precluded from using money from the state to award every teacher a raise, even if they do not qualify for merit pay or are rated below effective. 
Miami Rep. Erik Fresen, who is in charge of House education appropriations, told the Miami Herald ""we provided $480 million for districts to provide much-deserved salary increases to whom they determine meet their criteria of effective."" 
His Senate counterpart, Sen. Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, told us while the raises are not guaranteed to every teacher, ""At the end of the day, there should be something for everybody."" 
But it’s not up to Scott, or the Legislature for that matter. Florida law says the state cannot dictate teacher salaries. Teacher salaries are negotiated between the school districts and teachers union. So even though legislators approved a half-billion dollar pot of money for teacher raises, there is no guarantee that every teacher will get a raise. 
School districts in talks with unions will ultimately decide who gets raises, who doesn’t and how much. All the state and Scott can do is strongly suggest how school districts dish out the extra money they’re getting. 
""However, it must be kept in mind that other funding increases are being provided to school districts,"" said FEA spokesman Mark Pudlow. ""Presumably, that money could be bargained for increased salaries, so technically, every Florida teacher ‘may get a pay raise.’"" 
Our ruling 
Rick Scott said ""every Florida teacher gets a pay raise."" 
Will every Florida teacher get a pay raise? It seems likely, with the influx of money poured into education this year. But Scott can’t decree it, and the budget is written so that it applies to high-performing educators. Plus, some superintendents have said the inclusion of non-instructional personnel will make it harder if not impossible to award every teacher a raise.

Miami Dolphins PAC says that stadium renovation will ""create more than 4,000 new local jobs”
","
As Miami-Dade residents begin to vote on whether to help finance a $350 million stadium for the Miami Dolphins, project boosters distributed mailers promising that the project will deliver thousands of new local jobs. 
One mailer stated: ""The plan will not only create more than 4,000 new local jobs, it is critical for attracting more sporting and entertainment events to a world class Miami facility which increases tourism, supports local businesses and pumps hundreds of millions of dollars into our community."" 
The mailer was paid for by the stadium’s political action committee, Friends of Miami First, which has raised $1 million since April 1. The contributions came from the Dolphins and South Florida Stadium LLC, team owner Stephen Ross’ company. 
The 4,000 jobs figure has been repeated multiple times in recent months as the Dolphins sought financing from the state and county. A separate mailer states ""support over 4,000 new jobs for Miami-Dade"" and shows a photo of a construction worker. 
Here we are fact-checking the mailer’s claim that the renovation of the Sun Life stadium will ""create more than 4,000 new local jobs."" (Read our related Dolphins stadium fact-checks here and here.) 
Goal includes local hires 
The job creation figure is a selling point for the Dolphins, as they work at record speed to convince state legislators who conclude their session May 3 to sign off on a plan for $90 million in sales tax rebates and to allow an increase in the mainland Miami bed tax to generate about $289 million. The mailer omits those amounts, but it does state that the team would repay the state and county about $159 million. 
If the Legislature and Gov. Rick Scott give the go-ahead, Miami-Dade voters will be asked if they want to designate annual tourist room taxes for the project in a May 14 referendum. (Early and absentee voting started April 29.) 
The agreement requires private funding, which is expected to come from the Dolphins and the NFL to pay for more than half the project. By May 22, the NFL will decide whether to award the 50th Super Bowl in 2016 to Miami or San Francisco. 
The team’s agreement with the county says that the team will ""aspire"" to hire at least 70 percent of the workers from Miami-Dade with 10 percent from Miami Gardens -- the city where the stadium is located -- and at least 20 percent from low-income areas. The team will also ""aspire"" to hire at least 35 percent of the subcontractors from Miami-Dade. There is no financial penalty if the team doesn’t meet those local hiring goals and there is no goal or requirement regarding the sheer number of jobs, county spokeswoman Suzy Trutie said. 
Study used to come up with job figures 
The mailer didn’t provide details about its numbers, so we asked Dolphins spokesman Eric Jotkoff to elaborate. 
Jotkoff allowed a PolitiFact Florida reporter and a Miami Herald business reporter to review -- but not retain -- a copy of a study paid for by the Dolphins that the team used to arrive at that figure. 
The study, prepared by the Washington Economics Group in 2010, was about a possible $225 million stadium renovation which assumed some hotel bed tax participation by Broward County, so it includes job projections for Miami-Dade and Broward combined. 
It concluded the project would produce 3,740 jobs, which assumes at least one year of employment per person. That includes 1,550 direct jobs and the remainder are indirect jobs in related industries and induced jobs generated by the economic activity. 
The jobs included 39 percent in the ""knowledge based sector,"" which includes information technology, finance, real estate and other areas; 34 percent construction; and the remainder were government related or ""other."" 
But the Dolphins have not produced a study of the current project to show it will create more than 4,000 local jobs. Instead, the team is using cocktail napkin estimates here: If a $225 million project would create 3,740 jobs, then a $350 million project would create at least 4,000, they say. 
""It’s a conservative estimate of jobs that this will create,"" Jotkoff said. 
These 4,000 jobs are associated with the 25-month construction project. Jotkoff said some of the jobs will continue beyond the 25 months but he had no details as to how many. 
The same firm did a separate study in 2013 that concluded there are 14,503 permanent current jobs at the Sun Life Stadium, mostly with the Dolphins. That study was prepared for the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce, which endorsed the stadium proposal, and a related entity the South Florida Progress Foundation. 
Experts weigh in on jobs claim 
We sent the Dolphins’ jobs claim and a summary of the 2010 study to multiple economists, including some who specialize in the business of sports. They raised several caveats about the job growth figures. 
First, these aren’t permanent jobs. (Jotkoff said some jobs would extend beyond 25 months, but he had no details as to how many.) 
These are ""4,000 jobs we are talking about during the construction phase,"" said University of Florida economics professor Roger Blair, who teaches a class on the business of sports. ""Why is that something get excited about? (These are) jobs that people will have for a couple of years and then they will disappear."" 
And, those jobs aren’t coming here for free -- the public is paying for them through the hotel bed tax and the state sales tax. Economists say that you have to factor in the spending that won’t happen elsewhere in the state, due to the public money earmarked for this particular project. The majority of sales taxes go into the state’s general fund, which pays for law enforcement, education, environmental programs and other areas. 
The bed tax would be an increase, so the Dolphins can argue that’s new money and wouldn’t be spent elsewhere, since it is being created for them. Tourist taxes can only be spent on certain uses such as stadiums, convention centers and museums. 
""The problem is that these jobs have to be financed,"" said Smith College economics professor Andrew Zimbalist. ""Would it create jobs if the county hired 1,000 workers to dig a big hole and then a 1,000 more to fill it up? If so, then no city would ever have any unemployment."" 
(Zimbalist is a consultant for Major League Baseball but told PolitiFact he does not consult for the NFL.) 
The jobs wouldn’t be significant for the county, economists told PolitiFact. 
""I certainly don’t want to disparage any job creation figures, as those are real jobs for real people, but payroll employment in Miami-Dade County is over 1 million, so this wouldn’t be an economic game changer,"" said Chris Lafakis, senior economist at Moody’s who analyzes Florida’s economy. ""The best way to judge the economic merits of this project are how will this project be paid for and how else would that funding be spent? These are very important questions in order to determine the net benefit to the Miami Dade economy."" 
Also, one expert pointed out that the study was paid for by team, so that’s not an independent analysis. 
""The organizations that often provide these economic impact studies have something to gain or have a vested interest,"" said Robert Baade, a professor who specializes in the economics of sports at Lake Forest College. ""Certainly if the team commissioned the study that would be true ... They are going to put the project’s best foot forward ... They realize there is a skeptical and reluctant public and they’ve got to make the project look good. That doesn’t make them evil -- it does mean they are erring on side of optimism rather than taking a more conservative approach."" 
Our ruling 
The mailer distributed by Miami First said that the Dolphins stadium renovation will ""create more than 4,000 new local jobs."" 
The Dolphins based the number on a 2010 study of a $225 million project that concluded 3,740 jobs in Miami-Dade and Broward. They haven’t shown any study of the current project to support their claim that it will create more than 4,000 local jobs. Instead, they tacked on an extra 260 jobs to the new $350 million project and say that’s conservative. 
The key omission here is that these are jobs associated with the 25-month stadium renovation project and include temporary positions. The Dolphins say that some jobs would continue, but they have provided no details as to how many of those 4,000 jobs would extend beyond the construction phase. 
To get those jobs, the team would receive $379 million from the state and county over about three decades, and eventually pay back about $159 million. 
As to whether the jobs will be local, the team has set a goal to hire the vast majority of the workers from Miami-Dade County but there is no financial penalty if they fail to do so.

California editorial cartoonist says state of Texas last inspected exploded fertilizer plant in 2006
","
Defending an editorial cartoon that ticked off Gov. Rick Perry, creator Jack Ohman said he intended to make a provocative point about government oversight in the wake of a Texas disaster that left 14 people dead and 200 people injured.

The April 25, 2013, cartoon by Ohman, editorial cartoonist for the Sacramento (Calif.) Bee, depicts Perry as making one of his pitches for businesses to come to Texas. In the cartoon’s first panel, Perry says from behind a dais: ""Business is booming in Texas!"" The cartoon’s next panel shows the April 17, 2013, explosion of the fertilizer plant in West, Texas, with ""BOOM!"" in red letters plus a flag with ""low regs"" visible near flames.

Challenging the cartoon, Perry said in a letter to the Bee, published April 26, 2013, that ""I won't stand for someone mocking the tragic deaths of my fellow Texans and our fellow Americans... The Bee owes the community of West, Texas an immediate apology for your detestable attempt at satire.""

Stuart Leavenworth, who edits the Bee’s editorial page, which aired a few negative factual claims about Texas in 2012, stood by the cartoon. For his part, Ohman wrote in an article posted after the cartoon debuted April 25, 2013: ""The Texas chemical plant had not been inspected by the state of Texas since 2006. That's seven years ago. You may have read in the news that Gov. Perry, during his business recruiting trips to California and Illinois, generally described his state as free from high taxes and burdensome regulation. One of the burdensome regulations he neglected to mention was the fact that his state hadn't really gotten around to checking out that fertilizer plant.""

We wondered about Ohman’s claim that the state last inspected, or checked, the plant in 2006.

Ohman did not respond to our inquiry. But his year reference alone is incorrect, it turns out, while the issue of which agencies, state or federal, could or should have headed off the evening explosion has not (and may not be) settled.

According to news stories and government documents, a couple of state agencies went to the plant before the explosion and federal agencies also played roles. ""A patchwork of state and federal agencies regulated the West fertilizer plant,"" the Austin American-Statesman said in an April 24, 2013, news article, with nearly all focused on pollution concerns or securing the facility and its potentially dangerous fertilizers from criminal or terrorist threat. 
Let's recap agency visits, starting with the state departments.

Texas Commission on Environmental Quality

The commission regulates the state’s air and water quality and has authority to inspect fertilizer businesses, though an April 19, 2013, American-Statesman news story quoted its executive director, Zak Covar, as saying it typically does so only after it receives complaints.

Another Statesman news article, published April 20, 2013, said that in commission parlance, the West facility is considered a ""minor source"" of pollutants since it’s authorized to emit only 0.11 tons of soot and 0.92 tons of anhydrous ammonia each year. Major source facilities, by contrast, emit at least 100 tons per year of certain contaminants, the newspaper said, and regularly draw commission investigations.

By email, commission spokeswoman Andrea Morrow told us that unlike air, water and waste-related fronts involving state-issued permits and the like, other ""industrial conditions at facilities are not under TCEQ’s investigative authority nor its regulatory control.""

The April 19 Statesman story said agency records show two complaints filed against West Fertilizer, which owns the plant, since the company began operating in 1962.  

According to the newspaper, a 2002 complaint said: ""There is a cloud of dust. Particles are falling like snow around town. People are afraid to complain, however, this is effecting neighbors health with scratchy throats, cough and sneezing."" A subsequent investigation found no nuisance conditions, the newspaper said.

In 2006, the story said, the commission received an odor complaint. An agency investigation found that the facility’s permit had expired and issued a notice of violation for operating without a required air quality permit. The matter was resolved at the end of the year, the story said, when the agency granted the facility a new air permit for its two 12,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.

Also, the story said, a second permit, for the loading and storage of fertilizer materials, was issued in 2007. Both permits were granted after an agency technical review and a public comment period during which no member of the public commented either time, the newspaper said.

""With no new complaints,"" the story said, ""no on-site inspection has taken place at the facility since 2007."" By email, Morrow told us the agency last conducted a ""site investigation"" at the plant Jan. 16, 2007.

Office of the Texas State Chemist

The April 19 Statesman story said oversight of the fertilizer industry in Texas is handled primarily by the Office of the State Chemist’s Feed and Fertilizer Control Service at Texas A&M AgriLife Research, with duties focused on serving fertilizer users by testing products to make sure that they are free of contaminants and that their labels accurately reflect the advertised product.

The story said the office registers companies such as West Fertilizer, which experts described as a sort of compounding pharmacy for fertilizers that stores tons of chemicals it mixes for farmers depending on their particular soil and planting needs. Since 2007, the agency has also overseen sales of ammonium nitrate, which can be made into explosives, the story said.

The office can also inspect individual sites ""for product safety and security,"" the office’s director, Tim Herrmann, was quoted as saying. He also was quoted as saying the West facility had been inspected ""quite recently.""

The April 20 Statesman news story quoted Hermann saying that ammonium nitrate is a common fertilizer ingredient, because it doesn’t break down as quickly as other fertilizers. That’s handy if, say, a farmer spreads the fertilizer anticipating a rainfall to carry it into the soil, but then it remains dry.

But because it can be used to make explosives, it is more tightly regulated than other farm chemicals — as a security threat, the Statesman said. Since 2007, Texas has required those who buy and sell the chemical to be registered and record the transactions. Herrman, whose office handles the paperwork, said fertilizer distribution centers such as West Fertilizer also must be deemed ""100 percent in compliance"" to maintain their license to handle ammonium nitrate, a standard the West facility met, he told the newspaper.

By telephone, Hermann told us the office last went to the plant on April 5, 2013, at the request of the plant’s owners who expressed concern they had received fertilizer ingredients that were not what they were labeled. A letter from the state office’s associate director, Ben Jones, to the fertilizer company--dated April 16, 2013--seems to confirm the product ordered by the company, diammonium phosphate, was not entirely what it was supposed to be. The letter encourages the company to take the issue up with the company that originated the product.

Documents posted online by the agency indicate that a representative of the state chemist went to the plant in January, June, July and September 2012 and that agency employees went to the facility one to 10 times each year from 2004 through 2011.

Referring to ongoing investigation of the cause of the fatal explosion, Hermann said he could not comment on the nature of the office’s inspections.

Federal agencies

The April 19 Statesman story indicated it’s not clear that a state agency holds direct responsibility for gauging the safety of such plants in that a patchwork of government entities, including federal departments, could play roles.

Homeland Security

For instance,  in light of the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, an attack in which Timothy McVeigh made explosives from ammonium nitrate, as well as the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has been writing rules tightening the sale and purchase of that chemical, the newspaper said.

The agency's Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) requires facilities that handle high-risk chemicals to send a self-assessment to the agency, which then determines if the facility needs to be regulated. Those that don't send in the required information can be fined or closed. A Homeland Security spokesman told the newspaper that West Fertilizer had yet to respond: ""The West Fertilizer Co. facility is not currently regulated under the CFATS program.""

OSHA

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, generally entrusted with overseeing workplace safety, rarely inspects fertilizer facilities, the newspaper said, with the agency having inspected only a half-dozen fertilizer manufacturers in Texas in recent years. The paper said OSHA inspections are triggered by complaints, referrals from other government agencies and after deadly incidents. In a news article published the same day, the New York Times quoted an unidentified OSHA spokesman as saying the West plant was not included in its so-called National Emphasis Plan for inspections because it did not produce explosives, had no major prior accidents and the Environmental Protection Agency did not rate it as a major risk. The plant’s latest OSHA inspection occurred in 1985, the Times said.

ProPublica, a nonprofit investigative news organization, said in an April 25, 2013, article that it’s unclear if any agencies failed to inspect the plant when they should have, quoting a Huffington Post news story posted April 22, 2013 stating that since the OSHA inspection, ""regulators from other agencies have been inside the plant, but they looked only at certain aspects of plant operations, such as whether the facility was abiding by labeling rules when packaging its fertilizer for sale.""

Environmental Protection Agency

The EPA, which oversees air and water quality,requires risk management plans at all facilities that store hazardous chemicals to keep local communities apprised of local risks, the Statesman reported. According to EPA records, though, West Fertilizer was supposed to update its plan in 2004 but didn't do so for another two years, the paper said. Federal inspectors also found that the company kept poor training records, hadn't developed a formal written maintenance program and had operating procedures that failed to address the ""consequences of deviation,"" the newspaper reported.

According to the EPA, following a $2,300 fine, the company ""certified they corrected the deficiencies"" and filed an updated plan in 2011 as required. ""The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes,"" the company stated in the plan.

Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration

The largest fine levied on the plant, for $10,000, was handed down in 2012 by the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the Statesman said, when West Fertilizer failed to write a security plan to transport anhydrous ammonia, a chemical fertilizer stored under pressure. The company said it couldn't afford to pay that amount, and the penalty was halved after West Fertilizer agreed to correct the oversight, the newspaper said. An administration investigator inspected the plant in September 2011, according to documents spelling out the reduced fine.

Summing up: One state office went to the plant a few weeks before the disaster and multiple times in recent years, while another, with authority over air and water issues, last inspected it in early 2007. Separately, federal agencies monitored and occasionally penalized the plant, most recently in 2011.

Our ruling

Ohman said the fertilizer plant in West was last inspected by the state of Texas in 2006.

In fact, one state agency went to the plant less than two weeks before the disaster and multiple times over recent years, while the state’s environmental agency was there in 2007. As significantly, this claim leaves misimpressions that the state routinely conducts major inspections of such plants and that federal government has no particular role. Neither conclusion was supported by news stories published before the cartoon came out.

We're not taking a position here about the Texas regulatory climate nor are we concluding that agencies should be let off the hook for what happened before the explosion. That said, the statement is not accurate. We rate it as False.",/factchecks/2013/may/01/jack-ohman/california-editorial-cartoonist-says-state-texas-l/

Barack Obama says U.S. has no airports ranked in the top 25 worldwide
","
During a press conference on April 30, 2013, President Barack Obama addressed a number of high-profile issues, including the fighting in Syria, the Boston Marathon attack, immigration legislation and the across-the-board cuts to federal spending known as the sequester. 
On the sequester, Obama expressed his ambivalence about signing a bill that passed Congress a few days earlier. The bill, which would ease the sequester’s hit on the Federal Aviation Administration, moved quickly through the House and Senate amid public frustration. The flight delays stemmed from cuts to air traffic control staffing; the bill shifted $253 million from an airport improvement fund to the air traffic control system. 
Obama said the pressure on air travelers left him with little choice but to sign the bill, but he also decried the piecemeal approach to solving the nation’s budget and infrastructure challenges. 
If lawmakers were ""seriously concerned about passenger convenience and safety,"" Obama said, ""then they shouldn't just be thinking about tomorrow or next week or the week after that. They should be thinking about what's going to be happening five years from now, 10 years from now or 15 years from now. … How are we making sure that we're investing in things like rebuilding our airports and our roads and our bridges, and investing in early childhood education?"" 
Obama added: ""There was a recent survey of the top airports … in the world, and there was not a single U.S. airport that came in the top 25. Not one U.S. airport was considered by the experts and consumers who use these airports to be in the top 25 in the world. I think Cincinnati airport came in around 30th. What does that say about our long-term competitiveness and future?"" 
We wondered whether this survey really showed U.S. airports to be such a dismal lot. 
As it turns out, Obama got the numbers right. He was referring to the World Airport Awards, an independent, annual survey of 12 million travelers that ranks nearly 400 airports. The survey has been conducted by a British-based firm called Skytrax since 1999. 
The top-ranked U.S. airport in the group’s 2013 survey was indeed Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in the 30th spot. The airports ranking higher than that include a dozen in Asia (including the top two, Singapore Changi Airport and Incheon International Airport), seven in Europe, three in Africa, two in Australia, and just one in North America (Vancouver International Airport, at No. 8). 
In all, 17 U.S. airports cracked the top 100, with Denver 36th, San Francisco 40th, Atlanta 48th and none of the rest ending up higher than 50th. 
The 2013 results were not a fluke: We checked the 2012 and 2011 surveys as well and found that the top U.S. airport in both years was also Cincinnati, ranking 24th. 
We checked with Angela Gittens, director general of Airports Council International, a trade group for airports, to see what she thought of the rankings. She began by expressing skepticism about the survey’s rigor. (The firm says it surveys passengers online and by phone and uses systems to detect fraudulent submissions.) 
She added that the U.S. faces some stiff challenges competing in a global comparison of this sort. 
""Major international hubs in the U.S. are sometimes hampered by long immigration and security queues, which would hurt their rankings in comparison to an airport with primarily domestic service, such as Cincinnati,"" Gittens said. Cincinnati, which outperformed no fewer than 50 U.S. airports that have larger traffic, is hardly an international hub on the scale of New York’s JFK, Los Angeles or Miami. 
Peter Miller, a spokesman for Skytrax, agreed. He said the U.S. may be suffering in the survey because of the importance of security processing and immigration to many passengers -- ""not just actual waiting times, but also traveler treatment in these areas."" 
Gittens added that U.S. airports have a hard time competing with newer airports in Asia. In many countries, she said, ""the national governments see their airports as key assets for their economic vitality and strive to make the visitors’ journey through the airport as smooth as possible."" 
So the rankings Obama cited should be taken with a grain of salt. More important, the rankings don’t entirely support the president’s argument that the federal government needs to spend more money ""rebuilding our airports"" and providing for ""passenger convenience and safety."" 
Of the 39 factors that went into the survey’s rankings, we count only 13 that address airport capital improvements -- projects like terminal and waiting-area design, signage, public transit access, ease of navigation, and baggage-handling systems. Another five factors in the survey involve security. 
This leaves a slight majority of factors that concern amenities and hospitality -- factors such as choice of bars, shopping options, restaurant prices, entertainment facilities, washroom cleanliness, availability of luggage trolleys, and ""friendliness of airport staff."" 
""The survey covers a wide cross-section of amenities and facilities at every airport, but it is true to say that one of the most prominent sections is the focus on service, staff, convenience, and waiting times,"" said Peter Miller, a spokesman for Skytrax. ""These are the issues that are of prime importance to travelers, and which cause the biggest distinction between airports worldwide."" 
Our ruling 
Obama said the United States needs to invest more in its airports over the long term in part because ""there was a recent survey of the top airports … in the world, and there was not a single U.S. airport that came in the top 25."" He is spot-on about the rankings, but the survey in question offers only imperfect support for the argument that the federal government should invest more in its airports, since the survey measures not just major infrastructure aspects of airports (which the federal government would help fund) but also passenger amenities (something the government would not get directly involved in). We rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/may/01/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-has-no-airports-ranked-top-25/

Dimitrijevic said board vote on pay, budget accomplished reforms
","
Trying to sidetrack state legislation that seeks deep cuts in their pay and budget, Milwaukee County Board supervisors took matters into their own hands. 
The board voted to approve a multi-pronged reform package, ""meaning Board Supervisors’ salaries will be cut by 20 percent, staff will be cut by 50 percent and the Board’s budget will be cut by 50 percent,"" said an April 25, 2013 County Board news release that extensively quoted Chairwoman Marina Dimitrijevic. 
So, since the measure passed on a 15-3 vote, that means salaries and the budget will be cut, right? 
Maybe not. 
While Dimitrijevic said the board had ""accomplished meaningful reform,"" Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele -- who backs a fast-moving state Assembly bill that would clip the County Board’s wings -- raised doubts about the significance of the vote. 
As Abele mulls whether to veto the County Board action, we decided to take a closer look. 
  
Some background 
The state bill, backed by key Milwaukee civic and business leaders, seeks to limit the authority, role and budget of the board. Critics say the board has blocked or slowed changes to county operations that were strained by the 2002 pension scandal and other problems. 
Fourteen of 18 County Board members oppose the state bill, and have decried the state legislation as meddling into local affairs that would harm checks and balances. 
The state bill would trump the County Board’s action on spending. It is set for votes in the Assembly on May 8, 2013 and Senate on May 14, 2013. It was authored by state Rep. Joe Sanfelippo, R-West Allis, a former member of the Milwaukee County Board. Republican Gov. Scott Walker, a former Milwaukee County executive, has expressed support for the measure. 
The state bill would reduce supervisors’ pay by about 50 percent, to $24,000, and drop the board’s budget by two-thirds. It also seeks to make clear that Abele and future county executives have more control over operations. The pay cut, however, needs voter approval in a referendum that would be held in 2014. 
Supervisor pay was last raised in 2001, shortly before the pension scandal that rocked county government. Pay had peaked at $52,227, but supervisors and Walker agreed to reduce it to $50,679 in 2004, where it still stands. 
The board resolution 
The text of the county resolution that was approved by the board states that it seeks to ""reduce County Board Supervisor salaries by 20 percent, from approximately $50,679 to $40,543, and the Chairperson’s from $71,412 to $57,130, beginning with the term commencing April 18, 2016."" 
Any future pay increases would require a two-thirds vote of the board and be limited to the rate of inflation. Additionally, supervisors’ salaries could not exceed those of state legislators. 
The resolution also says the County Board will submit a 2014 budget request that cuts spending 50 percent, including cutting the number of staff positions in half. Future budget increases would require a two-thirds vote. 
So, the chairwoman has the numbers right in the County Board news release she shepherded. 
But this is not a done deal, as the blunt language in the news release states. 
To take effect, changes in compensation policy and County Board procedures must be enshrined in county ordinances. So, to make good on its resolution, the board would have to approve the ordinances at some future point. 
The text of the resolution makes it clear that more steps remain, stating the board ""hereby pledges"" to reduce the salaries and ""will submit"" a 50 percent budget reduction. The resolution directs County Board staff to draft the necessary ordinance changes ""as soon as practicable."" 
Bottom line, the board promised reform, in writing, putting it on the record in a way that would be difficult politically to back away from. But the measure itself did not accomplish the changes. 
We asked Dimitrijevic why a resolution, not an ordinance, was put up for a vote. 
She said the board wanted to make sure the changes are done correctly. That might only take a week or so, she said. If Abele signs the resolution approved by the board, or the board overrides an Abele veto of the resolution, ""we’ll be ready to roll on it,"" she said. 
Dimitrijevic said the board intends to approve the cuts even if the state law is unexpectedly derailed or slowed. 
""We’re going ahead with this plan no matter what,"" Dimitrijevic said. 
It’s worth noting that even an ordinance change is not set in stone. The board could repeal an ordinance change, just as it could decline to adopt an ordinance changing its pay even though it has pledged to do so in a resolution. 
Sanfelippo cites that reality, and the board’s failure to vote on formal ordinance changes, as arguments for using state law to try to cut the pay and budget. A state law would prevent  the board from changing its mind down the road, he said. He noted that drafts of his bill (AB-85) have been circulating since January 2013. 
""They had time,"" Sanfelippo said. 
Our rating 
A news release overseen by Dimitrijevic after 15 of 18 supervisors adopted reforms she championed said the ""meaning"" of the action was that ""Supervisors’ salaries will be cut by 20 percent"" and ""the Board’s budget will be cut by 50 percent."" 
The claim accurately conveys the intent of the resolution, but goes too far in leaving the impression the cuts were actually adopted by the board. It leaves out the key fact that the resolutions have no binding effect on their own. On their own they don’t ""accomplish"" the cuts.

"['Georgia', 'State Budget', 'Renee Unterman']","
Did vote come at a price?
","
A state senator caused a stir when she gave a speech accusing some of her colleagues of being beholden to some influential industries because of their support for a bill. 
Sen. Renee Unterman, a Republican from Gwinnett County, opposed House Bill 132, which would allow dentists, dental hygienists and pharmacists to regulate their own professions under the auspices of the Department of Community Health and remove those regulatory duties from Secretary of State Brian Kemp. 
Kemp’s office annually handles more than 430,000 license renewals for professionals across Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported. Unterman said this change would create another layer of government, which she said is counter to Republican Party principles. 
On the next to last day of this year’s session, Unterman offered a reason why some lawmakers supported the bill. She posted a graphic in front of her fellow senators detailing how much money some of them have received from dentists, pharmacists and some of their political action committees. 
The total: $142,400. 
PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Unterman’s figure was correct, along with the context she included. 
""These figures up here are not everybody in this room,"" she said. ""This is only leadership, and this is only for a one two-year term."" 
Unterman added, hoping to shame some senators into voting against the bill: ""Let your money do the dialing in the state Senate because the pharmacists and dentists had the money."" 
Atlanta Journal-Constitution Political Insider columnist Jim Galloway wrote that gasps could be heard from the lobbyists watching the proceedings. Some senators may have been searching for something more comfortable at that moment, like a root canal. 
The Senate passed the bill by 45-8 margin. Unterman voted against it. Gov. Nathan Deal signed the legislation last week. 
Unterman forwarded us 57 pages of records detailing the contributions. It took PolitiFact Georgia some time to dig through Unterman’s information and to conduct our own research. As she said, contributions totaled more than $142,000. But we noticed a few problems with the information she forwarded. 
Most of the contributions were made more than two years ago. Unterman’s staff was focusing on contributions made since 2008, they said, although some of the contributions they included dated to the 2006 election cycle. In her floor speech, the senator used the words ""a two-year term."" 
""I made a mistake,"" Unterman said. ""I was thinking it was the last term."" 
We noticed some of the names of the senators in Unterman’s list were not in Senate leadership, and that some of the senators currently in leadership were not included. Senate leadership includes Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, the Senate’s presiding officer; David Shafer, the Senate’s president pro tem; three senators picked by Gov. Nathan Deal as his floor leaders; and three senators from the Democratic and Republican parties. 
Unterman said she included the names of some senators who are currently not in leadership because they served on the Senate’s Regulated Industries and Utilities Committee. The bill was vetted by that committee before it came to the entire Senate, Unterman explained. Fourteen senators, including Unterman, serve on that committee. Four members of that committee are part of the official Senate leadership. 
During the past two calendar years, Senate leadership received about $40,000 in contributions from dentists, pharmacists and their PACs, state records show. If you go back to 2008, the total is $85,875. About one-half of those donations were made to Cagle. By law, Cagle cannot vote on any bills. 
Unterman said she’s received lots of money from dentists and pharmacists. Over the past two years, we found $12,200 in contributions. We found $27,500 in contributions if you go back to 2008. 
PolitiFact Georgia also calculated all contributions we found were made since 2008 to the current Senate leadership and to all members of the Regulated Industries and Utilities Committee except Unterman. The total was $140,375. If you add Unterman, the total is $167,875. 
""My whole point was to look at the amount of money put into the Gold Dome,"" Unterman said. ""It was a lot of money."" 
Indeed, it is. 
To sum up, Unterman said state Senate leaders collected $142,400 in campaign contributions from dentists and pharmacists during the past two years. Unterman told us she misspoke when she said the past two years. Her research was intended to go back to 2008. 
Her research included eight members of a Senate committee that is not part of the current leadership. If you include those senators, Unterman’s claim nearly hits the mark. If you exclude those senators, the claim is off by nearly 40 percent. 
Unterman’s dollar figure is accurate, but there’s some important context missing here. Our rating: Half True.

Goodlatte says U.S. prosecutions for lying on gun background checks are down 40 percent under Obama
","
U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th, wants the Department of Justice to strengthen enforcement of existing gun laws before Congress adds more. 
He was part of a panel on ABC’s ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos"" on April 14 and criticized President Barack Obama’s administration for lax prosecution of people caught lying on federal background checks necessary to purchase to guns. 
""Enforcement is down 40 percent overall in his administration,"" Goodlatte said. 
U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., challenged the statement. 
""George Bush’s presidency had the same dismal record on enforcement of the background check as this presidency has during the last four years,"" he said. 
We decided to check whether enforcement is down 40 percent under Obama, a figure Goodlatte cited three days before gun control legislation failed in the U.S. Senate. 
The National Instant Criminal Background Check System began operating in 1998. It’s an automated system that enables a gun seller to instantly check a series of state and federal databases to determine whether a potential purchaser is eligible to buy a gun under national and state laws. A very low percentage -- about 1 or 2 percent -- are rejected each year, usually for a felony conviction or indictment. Other reasons, such as adjudication for mental illness or an outstanding order of protection, are also grounds for denial. 
Goodlatte’s spokeswoman sent us to TRAC, a Syracuse University website that collects monthly data from the Department of Justice. We looked there, as well as the department’s original reports. 
We focused only on prosecutions resulting from background checks -- as opposed to prosecution of other gun offenses -- because Goodlatte’s comments were directed at background checks. We also ignored prosecutions by state officials because the congressman’s statement referred to the presidential role. 
Federal prosecution data is available from 2002 through 2010, except for 2004. 
During the six years data is available for former President George W. Bush’s administration -- 2002-2003 and 2005-2008 -- a total of 628 federal cases were prosecuted as a result of failed background checks. That averages about 105 annually. 
Only two years of statistics are available for Obama’s administration: 77 cases were prosecuted in 2009 and 44 in 2010. That averages to about 61 annually. Another year of data should be released this summer. 
When we compare the administrations -- realizing there are years of data missing for each -- there has been a 42 percent decline in average annual prosecutions between the Bush and Obama years. 
So Goodlatte’s claim sounds right, but it’s missing important context: The Justice Department has never placed a high priority on pursuing perjury charges from background checks. There are about 70,000 denials for gun purchases a year. Under Bush, 15/100th of 1 percent of the cases were prosecuted. Under Obama, 8/100th of 1 percent of the cases were prosecuted. 
Goodlatte glossed over this fact as he assigned blame to Obama. He set up his statement with some quick statistics: ""We have determined of the 76,000 people who were found to have lied on the background check in 2010, 4,700 of them were referred by the ATF for further investigation and prosecution, 62 of them were prosecuted,"" he said. (We should note that 62 prosecutions is inaccurate; the correct number is 44). 
""Every Republican on the House Judiciary Committee signed a letter to the president and the attorney general asking why that is and why there isn’t greater enforcement,"" Goodlatte continued. ""Enforcement is down 40 percent overall in his administration. The answer we got about the background checks was, `those are paper crimes.’"" 
Goodlatte didn’t respond when Gutierrez said the Bush and Obama administrations ""had the same dismal record."" 
Why is Uncle Sam reluctant to prosecute these cases? A 2004 reportfrom the Department of Justice’s inspector general provided several answers. It said agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms viewed the violations ""as distracting from more important cases, such as those involving firearms, traffickers, gangs, arson and explosives"" and ""saw little purpose in investigating a standard case in which the NICS successfully prohibited a person from purchasing a firearm."" 
The report also said that the cases lack ""jury appeal"" for prosecutors because it is difficult to prove that a prohibited person intentionally lied on the background check and in many parts of the nation ""juries are reluctant to convict a person who attempted to purchase a hunting rifle."" 
Our ruling 
Goodlatte said enforcement of laws against lying on federal background checks for gun purchases ""is down 40 percent"" under Obama. 
The congressman had the percentage right, but he glossed over the law’s history of lax enforcement. During the Bush and Obama administrations, only a tiny fraction of 1 percent of the violations was prosecuted. The Justice Department has seen little value in prosecuting cases in which background checks have already stopped prohibited people from buying guns. 
Goodlatte, in seeking to level partisan blame, offered a juicy statistic without context. We rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2013/may/01/bob-goodlatte/goodlatte-says-us-prosecutions-lying-gun-backgroun/

Republican Governors Association portrays Ed FitzGerald as a “pay to play” politician
","
Before officially declaring his candidacy for governor last week, Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald spent months preparing for his run against Republican incumbent John Kasich. 
Kasich’s allies have been preparing for FitzGerald nearly as long. 
There is little doubt FitzGerald will trade heavily on his experience as an FBI agent and his reputation for turning the page on a corrupt chapter of county government. But the GOP prefers to focus on FitzGerald’s largely inconsequential mention as ""Public Official 14"" in the indictment of Jimmy Dimora, the county commissioner later convicted on racketeering and other charges. 
Consider how the Republican Governors Association (RGA) welcomed FitzGerald to the race. 
""After failing to recruit a more experienced candidate, Democrats are now stuck with Ed FitzGerald’s brand of pay-to-play and corruption politics,"" said Executive Director Phil Cox. 
PolitiFact Ohio decided this was a good time to reexamine FitzGerald’s tangential connections to the widespread federal investigation of county corruption. The RGA statement was not the first -- nor will it be the last -- reference to the case. The Ohio Republican Party has launched a web site -- www.publicofficial14.com-- to blast FitzGerald, known in GOP shorthand as P.O. 14. 
But how fair and truthful are these tactics? 
The Plain Dealer wrote extensively in 2010 about FitzGerald’s bit role in the Dimora investigation. FitzGerald at the time was the mayor of Lakewood and the Democratic nominee for the powerful new position of county executive. Federal prosecutors charged Dimora a week after FitzGerald won the primary. They described a Lakewood deal for which Dimora had been bribed. 
On March 6, 2008, Dimora called FitzGerald on behalf of developer William Neiheiser, who was interested in leasing Lakewood’s ice rink. Neiheiser had been having trouble reaching the mayor. 
Neiheiser ""wants to make a proposal to you ... that he thinks will be advantageous to the city and to you if you wanted to talk to him,"" Dimora told FitzGerald, according to a wiretap transcript. 
FitzGerald replied: ""I’ll make the time … I’ll make time to talk to him."" 
Dimora added: ""If there’s anything we can do, uh, let us know …. any help we can provide."" 
Neiheiser pleaded guilty to charges that he bribed Dimora with free home improvements and other gifts in exchange for favors involving the ice rink and other public contracts. Essentially Dimora, then the chairman of the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party, flaunted his ability to get lower-level party leaders on the telephone when a patron such as Neiheiser was in need. 
Prosecutors did not accuse FitzGerald of wrongdoing in the Dimora indictment, let alone charge him or even identify him by name. But as The Plain Dealer found, Neiheiser contributed $250 to FitzGerald’s political campaign the following month. And in June 2008, the Lakewood City Council unanimously agreed at FitzGerald’s urging to lease the ice rink to a Neiheiser company. 
FitzGerald and those who served on the Lakewood council at the time defended the deal as a smart financial move for the city. The lease called for Neiheiser’s company to operate the rink and pay the city about $75,000 a year in rent. Neiheiser’s attorney told The Plain Dealer in 2010 that his client had spent more than $2 million to refurbish the city-owned complex. 
Matt Dolan, the Republican nominee for county executive in 2010, raised questions about FitzGerald’s involvement in the Dimora deal and branded his opponent as Public Official 14. 
FitzGerald rid his war chest of contributions from Dimora, Neiheiser and others caught up in the investigation by making a charitable donation. And after beating Dolan and taking office as county executive he rid the county payroll of many patronage hires loyal to Dimora’s political machine. 
But in January, FitzGerald’s name again surfaced in a case, this time at a trial for another crooked contractor, Michael Forlani. An FBI agent testified that Forlani used two intermediaries in 2008 to disguise his campaign contributions to the then-mayor. FitzGerald told The Plain Dealer at the time that the agent’s testimony was the first he had heard of the donations. 
Then came an extraordinary announcement from Ann Rowland, the lead prosecutor in the corruption case. In a statement U.S. attorneys rarely make, Rowland cleared FitzGerald. 
""Ed FitzGerald is not a target of the investigation,"" Rowland said. ""We have no evidence Ed FitzGerald knew Michael Forlani had anything to do with these contributions."" 
After seeing Cox’s statement last week on FitzGerald, PolitiFact Ohio asked RGA spokesman Jon Thompson to specify what the group meant by FitzGerald’s ""brand of pay-to-play and corruption politics."" Thompson specified the Public Official 14 designation. 
Thompson also noted that the Ohio GOP has tied FitzGerald to the corruption probe. And he shared a link to the conservative Third Base Politics blog, which reported that the left-leaning Plunderbund blog had deleted posts from 2010 that presented FitzGerald as Public Official 14. 
So, let’s review. 
Cox accused FitzGerald of perpetuating a ""brand of pay-to-play and corruption politics."" 
More than 60 other public officials, government employees and contractors have been convicted of charges stemming from the federal investigation. But the agents and prosecutors who tore up county government never accused FitzGerald of a crime. And though FitzGerald has surfaced a couple of times in the investigation, the lead prosecutor has said he is not under suspicion. 
The ""brand"" in question is one Republicans no doubt prefer as they gear up for Kasich’s re-election battle. But they have no proof that FitzGerald engaged in corrupt politics. And they misleadingly hide behind the cryptic and nuanced ""Public Official 14"" designation while ignoring the much more direct and meaningful exculpatory statement from the lead prosecutor. They also ignore the work FitzGerald has done to clean up after the corrupt regime that preceded him. 
Facts lay waste to any effort like this one that explicitly brands FitzGerald as a corrupt politician.
