No reports Queen Elizabeth tested positive for COVID-19
","Prince Charles tested positive for COVID-19, but there is no indication that his mother, the queen, did, too.  A March 28 post on a website called Gossip Blend claims otherwise.  ""Earlier today it was rumoured that Queen Elizabeth II tested positive for the novel coronavirus while many UK media outlets have kept silent,"" the post says.

Post saying new coronavirus stays in the air for 8 hours is false
","Since the novel coronavirus hasn’t been around that long, public health information about the virus and how it behaves is constantly changing.  That’s why social media posts that make sweeping medical claims about COVID-19 should be viewed with skepticism. Like this Facebook post, which displays a screenshot of a CNBC headline and claims COVID-19 is now considered ""airborne"" and remains in the air for eight hours. The post shows part of a real CNBC headline before cutting off at an ellipsis: ""WHO considers ‘airborne precautions’ for medical staff after study shows coronavirus …"" Below that, the post’s text reads, ""COVID-19 is confirmed as airborne and remains 8 hrs (sic) in air! So everyone is required to wear mask (sic) everywhere!!""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, the word ""airborne"" means different things to different scientists. Second, data about the nature of the coronavirus is evolving. But even in light those two considerations, this social media post distorts facts and presents exaggerated, alarmist information. Health officials are not recommending face masks for everyone ""everywhere."" Not yet, anyway. While the matter is being considered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, so far the agency hasn’t advised face masks for healthy people. It did recently update its guidance to say that, when masks are available, sick people should wear them when they are around others and upon entering healthcare providers’ offices. The CDC also says that if a sick person is unable to wear a mask, their caregiver should wear one when in the same room.  Public health officials have said that they don’t consider the virus to be airborne because its droplets are too large and heavy to remain in the air long, falling within a few seconds. ""The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They quickly fall on floors or surfaces,"" the World Health Organization says. ""You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within 1 meter of a person who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before washing your hands."" The Facebook post’s claim that the virus can remain in the air up to eight hours is unsubstantiated. Furthermore, the CNBC article the post references makes no such statement.  The article does refer to one recent study that suggests the virus might be able to stay in the air longer in some settings such as when medical staff are engaged in an ""aerosol-generating procedure."" Such procedures might include intubation, ventilation and airway suction. Under those circumstances, health officials are considering ""airborne precautions"" for medical staff, the story said. The study, published March 17 in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that transmission by aerosol — defined as a suspension of tiny particles or droplets in the air — is plausible in this virus, technically called SARS-CoV-2, in some settings. The virus ""remained viable in aerosols"" for three hours, the study said.  But this doesn’t mean the virus is now considered airborne. One researcher who participated in the study warns that the airborne question ""bedevils scientists trying to communicate with the public."" ""It combines a locus of substantial public fear with a question of true scientific nuance — a recipe for a misinformation mess,"" Dylan Morris, Princeton University researcher and co-author of the study, wrote in a post on his website.  ""Many viruses — from measles to flu, and including SARS-CoV-2 — are ‘airborne’ in the sense that one way of getting sick is to inhale virus particles (‘virions’) sneezed or coughed into the air within respiratory secretions. Some secretions are on the bigger end, and we tend to call those ‘droplets.’ Others are smaller, and we tend to call them ‘aerosols,’"" Morris says. ""The tricky crux of the matter is that when people say ‘airborne,’ what they often mean is ‘you’re at risk from virus particles hanging in the air — or being kicked back up into the air after falling to the ground — long, long after an infectious person sneezed them out.’ That’s much more of a risk for smaller, ‘aerosol’-end-of-the-spectrum secretions. And it turns out that it’s more of a risk for some viruses than for others."" Measles, for example, is considered a truly airborne virus because it typically remains infectious in the air for hours. Even though measles and flu illnesses can both be found in aerosol-like and in droplet-like secretions, Morris says, the flu is less transmissible. So far, scientists think COVID-19 looks more like the flu.  Linsey Marr, an expert in airborne disease transmission at Virginia Tech, told FactCheck.org that there isn’t enough evidence showing how exactly the new coronavirus is being spread between people, but said transmission is much more likely if you’re close to someone who is sick.  She gave an example of being directly next to someone smoking a cigarette — the closer you are, the more off a whiff you could catch — but the farther away you are from someone releasing the virus into the air, the lesser the concentration. A Facebook post says the virus that causes COVID-19 remains in the air for eight hours, and everyone is now required to wear masks. This is inaccurate. There is no current evidence that the virus can remain in the air for eight hours. While the CDC is exploring its position on whether masks should be worn more widely in the general population, it doesn’t ""require"" everyone to wear masks ""everywhere."" As more studies are done on how the virus persists in various environments, there may be extra precautions put in place, especially for health care professionals treating COVID-19 patients. There is still not enough known to say definitively how this new virus behaves in every setting. Preliminary studies suggest the virus may be more ""airborne"" than initially believed. But the term ""airborne"" should not be applied loosely as current research doesn’t indicate that COVID-19 is comparable to highly transmissible airborne illnesses like measles. Experts say the biggest threat of transmission is close contact with an infected person. The post makes unsubstantiated claims and twists facts to give a different impression. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C8E640>],/factchecks/2020/apr/02/facebook-posts/fact-checking-claims-say-covid-19-airborne/

Hospitalized children can have one parent present
","There is a lot of uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and how long the pandemic will last, but parents across the U.S. can be certain that they will always be able to accompany their children to the hospital. A recent Facebook post claimed that ""if your child gets this virus their (sic) going to hospital alone in a van with people they don’t know... to be with people they don’t know."" This run-on sentence ended with a soul-crushing statement: ""you will be at home without them in their time of need."" Before any parents get too worried, this claim is entirely untrue because hospitals need parental consent to treat minors. Dr. John Gilliam explained in an interview with PolitiFact that ""minors can’t consent to treatment, legally."" Dr. Gilliam works in Oregon as a hospitalist, an in-patient physician who works exclusively in a hospital. Parental consent is still a requirement in New York hospitals, where the virus is spreading rapidly and the New York State Department of Health is introducing temporary new visitor policies. The University of Rochester Medical Center and the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital have both announced that recovering adults aren’t allowed any visitors, but children are still allowed to have one guardian accompany them. If your child does have COVID-19 symptoms, the CDC first recommends to not take them to the hospital unless they develop emergency warning signs, such as having trouble breathing or experiencing persistent pain or pressure in the chest. The CDC has published guidelines for treating healthy adults and children with COVID-19 symptoms at home. The CDC also doesn’t consider children a high-risk group for COVID-19 and have found that children who have been confirmed to have the virus ""have generally presented with mild symptoms."" In the unlikely event that a child is hospitalized for complications from COVID-19, they will have a parent or another guardian by their side.

Hospitals refute surgeon general’s claim about nursing furloughs
","U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams made a startling claim about hospital nurses in Western New York when talking about the importance of properly deploying resources in the fight against the new coronavirus. In an interview with CBS This Morning, Adams was asked if there are enough ventilators to treat severely ill patients in places such as New York City, which has become the center of the pandemic in the United States.  ""We sent a team, a FEMA team, to help New York City make sure the resources are getting to where they need. I talked to people in western New York who said they’re furloughing nurses in hospitals in western New York state, while people in New York City are suffering. We need to make sure we get the right resources to the right people, and that’s what we’re committed to doing.""   We wondered whether his statement that Western New York hospitals are furloughing nurses is true.  A spokesperson for Dr. Adams said the surgeon general heard about furloughs from a doctor in the Rochester area.  ""The surgeon general spoke with a Rochester-area physician earlier this week, who shared that information,"" said Jennifer Sherman, director of public affairs in the Office of the Surgeon General. ""The point Dr. Adams was making is that in some states we are seeing a mismatch of resources, where one city may have more resources but fewer cases, and another city may have few resources but an abundance of cases. It's important states are coordinating with local jurisdictions and providers so they have the resources they need, and that is something the federal government is helping facilitate - in addition to deploying resources from the Strategic National Stockpile and FEMA."" We reached out to the doctor, who declined to speak with us on the record.  We reached out to hospitals to see if they know of any nursing furloughs in Western New York hospitals. None knew of any.  Rochester’s two major health systems, which operate most hospitals in the Rochester region, said they are not furloughing nurses.  Rochester Regional Health, which operates Rochester General Hospital and four others in surrounding communities, has not furloughed any nurses.  ""We are in the process of redeploying resources which includes nurses,"" said Public Information Officer Veronica Chiesi Brown. ""This means they are taken from one area and moved to another based on need. Nurses are a critical resource right now and we need more, not less."" University of Rochester Medicine, which operates Strong Memorial Hospital and six others in the Rochester region, may have nurses at home because they could be infected, but none are on furlough.   ""A small number of staff members who are symptomatic are staying home pending test results, but no furloughs are taking place in UR Medicine’s hospitals or ambulatory practices,"" said Chip Partner, assistant vice president for communications. In addition, Monroe County government and Rochester’s two major hospital systems on Friday  unveiled a plan to double its hospital capacity. The plan includes hiring more clinicians, including doctors and nurses.    The Genesee Valley Nurses Association, a professional organization for registered nurses in seven counties in the Rochester area, had not heard of any furloughs, said Nancy Iafrati, who is on the organization’s board of directors.  The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which operates medical centers in Buffalo, Batavia, and Canandaigua, are not furloughing nurses, and are looking to re-hire VA nurses who have retired, said Christina Mandreucci, press secretary for the department.  In Buffalo, major hospitals are hiring nurses, preparing for a surge of Covid-19 patients. Kaleida Health, which operates Buffalo General Medical Center and Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital, among others health care facilities, said it is hiring nurses. So is Erie County Medical Center. Catholic Health, which operates hospitals in Buffalo and recently opened a facility solely dedicated to treating coronavirus patients, has posted ""a call to service"" on its employment web page, seeking nurses, respiratory therapists and others.  A statewide professional organization said it is aware of furloughs of nurse anesthetists in New York State, because elective procedures have been canceled in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. The organization has sent a survey to its members to find out how many of those furloughs have occurred, said Stephanie Grolemund, president of the New York State Association of Nurse Anesthetists. Elsewhere in the country, there have been reports of furloughed health care workers, either because of exposure to the virus or because the organizations they work for depend on income from elective procedures and office visits, which have been postponed in an effort to stop the spread of the virus.  We couldn’t find any evidence of furloughs of nurses in Western New York. On the contrary, hospitals in Buffalo and Rochester are hiring nurses and are preparing plans for an anticipated surge in patients.  We rate Dr. Adams’ statement False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3F4040>],/factchecks/2020/apr/02/jerome-adams/hospitals-refute-surgeon-generals-claim-about-nurs/

Spam news websites spread false claim about coronavirus vaccine
","President Donald Trump has touted how quickly the government is developing potential COVID-19 vaccines. An article circulating on Facebook gives him even more credit. The story, which was published March 24 on several spam news websites, claims that Trump is getting ready to announce the name and launch date of a vaccine for the coronavirus. ""The president of the United States of America will officially make the announcement about the vaccine to cure the virus on Sunday,"" reads the article, which includes a purported photo of the vaccine. ""Roche medical company will launch the vaccine on Sunday."" The articles were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot) The stories, published on spam websites registered in West Africa, are bogus. Trump did not announce a vaccine on Sunday, March 29, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus infections. Several other fact-checkers have debunked the false news articles. While clinical trials have started for some potential vaccines, they are still at least a year away from being completed. The image in the article claims to show a COVID-19 vaccine, but it’s actually a testing kit developed by a Korean biotechnology company. Similar out-of-context images have circulated in India and Pakistan. Roche, a Swiss pharmaceutical company, has been shipping coronavirus tests to the U.S. and testing a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis for potential application in severe COVID-19 cases. The company has not developed a coronavirus vaccine. During a March 29 press briefing, Trump said potential COVID-19 vaccines ""are moving along very rapidly."" The first clinical trial of a potential COVID-19 vaccine began in Seattle in mid March. The trial will enroll 45 healthy adult volunteers over about six weeks, according to the National Institutes of Health. The potential vaccine was developed by scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and biotechnology company Moderna, Inc. RELATED: 7 ways to avoid misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic In a March 30 press release, the Department of Health and Human Services said it is accelerating clinical trials of that vaccine, as well as another potential COVID-19 vaccine from Janssen Research & Development. But the first phase of the latter trial is set to begin ""no later than fall of 2020 with the goal of making COVID-19 vaccine available for emergency use in the United States in early 2021,"" according to HHS. During his March 11 testimony to the House Oversight and Reform Committee on the coronavirus outbreak, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID, laid out a timeline for developing a COVID-19 vaccine. He said phase one will take about three months to determine if it’s safe, then phase two, during which scientists will test whether the vaccine works, could take another eight months at least. He cautioned that any process that moves faster than that could be dangerous. ""So when you’ve heard me say we would not have a vaccine that would even be ready to start to deploy for a year to a year and a half, that is the time frame,"" Fauci told representatives. ""Now anyone who thinks that it will go more quickly than that I believe will be cutting corners that would be detrimental."" Public domain records show that some of the websites spreading the bogus articles about a new coronavirus vaccine are registered in Ghana and Nigeria.

Did Ron Johnson say Americans should go back to work because “death is an unavoidable part of life?”
","Leaders across the country are largely unanimous in calling for compliance with dramatic social changes to slow the spread of the coronavirus. U.S. Sen Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican elected after a long career in the business world, struck a slightly different chord in a guest column in USA TODAY. The piece drew plenty of attention online and across social media, including an article published March 31, 2020, that has been shared widely on Facebook. That article summarized Johnson’s column with this headline: ""Ron Johnson: Americans Should Go Back To Work, Because ‘Death Is An Unavoidable Part Of Life.’"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Let’s see how that summary lines up with Johnson’s piece. The headline implies Johnson is calling for a widespread — or even comprehensive — return to work. The Johnson piece in USA Today, published March 29, 2020, makes clear at the start he is not calling for any such immediate return to normalcy. Here is how it reads: I’m not aware of any public official, including President Donald Trump, who is calling for a complete opening of the U.S. economy. What more people are saying is that as we learn more about COVID-19, we should evaluate the total societal cost of this awful disease and try to put things into perspective. … Imagine the potential psychological and human toll if this shutdown continues indefinitely, unemployment reaches 20% or higher, as some now predict, and we sink into a deep recession or depression. Johnson says social distancing ""should continue until this outbreak is under control."" But he did also reference death being unavoidable. Here’s the full context for that line: Every premature death is a tragedy, but death is an unavoidable part of life. More than 2.8 million die each year — nearly 7,700 a day. The 2017-18 flu season was exceptionally bad, with 61,000 deaths attributed to it. Can you imagine the panic if those mortality statistics were attributed to a new virus and reported nonstop? Johnson goes on to call for reversing the current labeling of ""essential businesses,"" saying we should instead determine nonessential business ""that pose a risk for coronavirus spread."" He said those could be shut down and financial support provided to the employees and businesses until they can re-open. The brief story linked in the Facebook post describes Johnson’s position more accurately than the headline, though it also opens by labeling him ""the living embodiment of clueless privilege."" A viral Facebook post said Johnson is saying ""Americans should go back to work, because 'death is an unavoidable part of life.'"" Johnson did use the line about death being unavoidable, but the headline exaggerates his position, implying he thinks all or most people should go back to work. He explicitly says he supports social distancing and keeping some businesses closed at this point.

"['North Carolina', 'Coronavirus', 'Jeff Jackson']","
Are NC hospital beds 'typically' 85% full?
","Hospitals are preparing for an influx of patients as the novel coronavirus spreads across the U.S. With that in mind, North Carolina state Sen. Jeff Jackson has tried to keep his constituents informed by posting on social media. Jackson, a Mecklenburg County Democrat, regularly tweets stats about the pandemic. And on March 19, he urged people to reschedule elective procedures to free up space for coronavirus patients. ""Hospitals are starting to cancel elective surgeries and doing their best to empty hospital beds to prepare for a surge. Our hospital beds are typically 85% full across the state. If we don't significantly reduce that number within the next week, that's a major problem,"" Jackson tweeted. Is it true that, under normal circumstances, hospitals operate at 85% capacity? We couldn’t find a supporting number. But we did learn that it’s normal for NC hospitals to treat patients while their facilities are close to being full. We reached out to Jackson about his tweet. He said he heard the figure from officials with North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services. So we reached out to them. DHHS spokeswoman SarahLewis Peel responded by email, but didn’t give an exact number. ""On any given day, our hospitals — by design — operate at 90 to 100% capacity. That’s why we have sought waivers to allow critical access hospitals to operate above their licensed capacity,"" Peel wrote. DHHS later clarified that those numbers are usually during flu season and that evidence is anecdotal. It’s from speaking with hospital managers and suppliers. David Weber, the associate chief medical officer at UNC Health, told NC Health News something similar. He said that, with the closure and downsizing of many rural hospitals, there are fewer beds overall across the state. ""The U.S., compared to years ago, has less open beds and on a normal busy week, you know, most of our hospitals, including UNC, would be running between 90 and 100% occupancy,"" he said. However, we need hard numbers -- not anecdotes -- to get the most accurate picture.   So, what stats are available? The North Carolina Health Association had a lower estimate, but its latest figures are from 2018. Cynthia Charles, the association’s vice president for communications, pointed to statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2015, the average US hospital occupancy rate was 65.5 percent. ""For North Carolina, (the) average hospital occupancy rate is 61% for 2018,"" she said. Other estimates PolitiFact found put the average occupancy rate in the 60-to-75 percent range. Charles noted that people may get different estimates depending on how they account for beds, among other things. ""There could be a difference in how they’re defining capacity, for example whether they are looking at licensed vs. staffed beds, or whether they are considering ‘current state’ staffing as capacity,"" she said. Mark Holmes, director of UNC’s Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, agreed with Charles. Holmes said there are different ways to count beds and averages. Staffing levels could also come into play, he said. Holmes and his colleagues recently analyzed cost reports filed to Medicare in 2018. Those numbers suggested a 58% occupancy average, he said. It’s likely that some small, rural hospitals bring down the statewide average. ""Some of our smaller hospitals are at less than 20%,"" he said. ""But larger ones — like Duke and UNC— are indeed at 85% on average throughout the year."" The Sheps Center recently published a study of NC hospital occupancy rates. Important final point: hospital capacity should not be viewed as the sole indicator of whether it can continue treating patients, Holmes said. Hospitals need four things to properly treat patients, he said: Hospitals may face limits in terms of square footage, Holmes said. But some government agencies are relaxing those regulations and hospitals are creating space where they can, such as dormitories. Indeed, Weber said UNC Health is shifting its units around and even using tents outside to triage and treat people with ailments that aren’t as serious as COVID-19. ""So the square feet and licenses are less important than, in general, the attention they often receive,"" Holmes said in an email. ""Most people who study this issue think the biggest limitations to capacity are equipment— e.g. ventilators — and qualified staff, especially as the epidemic infects staff and their family members."" Jackson said North Carolina’s hospital beds ""are typically 85% full across the state."" The way he worded his tweet makes it seems like all hospitals are usually at 85% capacity. That’s not right. It depends on the hospital and it depends on the season.  But he has a point that many of North Carolina’s hospitals routinely treat patients while their facilities are close to maximum capacity. So we rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968B2980>],/factchecks/2020/apr/01/jeff-jackson/are-nc-hospital-beds-typically-85-full/

Does Richmond pay to top school officials more than Fairfax County?
","Richmond City Councilwoman Kim Gray recently announced she’ll run for mayor this year, promising to be stricter on spending than incumbent Levar Stoney. Gray has been a constant critic of Stoney, accusing him of being more interested in higher office and grandiose plans than solving Richmond’s core problems. She led a charge that defeated Stoney’s signature proposal to replace the Richmond Coliseum and has opposed the mayor’s efforts to increase taxes on meals and real estate. During a March 3 radio interview on WRVA, Gray said Richmond doesn’t need higher taxes, it needs greater government efficiency - especially in its school system. Host John Reid asked what she would do differently than Stoney about schools. Gray said she’d look for savings in the school system’s central office. ""I would lose some of the top-heavy weight,"" said Gray, a former Richmond School Board member. ""We’re paying people exorbitant salaries, higher than the average across the entire Commonwealth. Even Fairfax County doesn’t pay the kind of salaries that Richmond is paying right now.""  Fairfax is one of the wealthiest counties in the nation and has a high cost of living. We fact-checked Gray’s claim that it pays school administrators less than Richmond. Gray told us she was referring to the salaries of Richmond Superintendent Jason Kamras, who was hired in 2018, and his top five administrators. She said she was under the impression they were paid more than their Fairfax counterparts, but didn’t have proof. So, under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, we requested the top 10 salaries paid by Richmond and Fairfax public schools. Here’s what we found: As a general rule, salaries are about 20% higher in Fairfax for comparable jobs.  Fairfax pays nine administrators more than $200,000 a year, compared to one in Richmond. Richmond Superintendent Kamras has a $250,000 salary; Fairfax Superintendent Scott Brayband is paid $311,526. The five people on Kamras’ leadership team in Richmond are paid between $175,250 and $180,547. The seven people on Brayband’s leadership team in Fairfax are paid between $202,478 and $224,447. As we’ve mentioned, it’s far more expensive to live in Fairfax than Richmond, largely because of housing costs. Salary.com says Fairfax County’s cost of living is 61% higher than Richmond’s; Payscale.com says it’s 50% higher. Those costs exceed the 20% salary bump the Fairfax school administrators have over their Richmond counterparts. In other words, the Richmond salaries have more purchasing power. Our ruling Gray, in complaining about what she sees as the high pay of top Richmond school officials, said, ""even Fairfax doesn’t pay the kind of salaries Richmond is paying."" That suggests Richmond administrators are taking home bigger checks than their Fairfax counterparts. That’s what Gray told us she thought, and it’s wrong. Actually, they’re taking home 20 percent less pay. If Gray, in the future, wants to compare the pay of school administrators adjusted for cost of living, she should specify that. But as for the comment she made, it’s False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097ADD500>],/factchecks/2020/apr/01/kim-gray/does-richmond-pay-top-school-officials-more-fairfa/

"['National', 'Coronavirus', 'Pennsylvania', 'Brian Fitzpatrick']","
A Pa. congressman said the U.S. coronavirus trajectory is more like South Korea than Italy. True?
","Last week, U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick spoke about the coronavirus pandemic on a local talk radio show, and he told the host that the outbreak in this country looks more like the one in South Korea than the one in Italy. ""We’ve got to give the American public a rough estimate of how long we think this is going to take, based mostly on the South Korean model, which seems to be the trajectory that we are on, thankfully, and not the Italian model,"" the Republican congressman from Bucks County said on The Dom Giordano Program. We wondered how the spread of the coronavirus in the United States compares with the spread of the disease in other parts of the world. When Fitzpatrick made those remarks, he was comparing the three countries’ case fatality rates, said Will Kiley, his spokesperson. That’s ""the key metric we’re all watching,"" he added. Fitzpatrick is right that the fatality rate in the United States roughly matches South Korea’s and is far lower than Italy’s. But Drexel epidemiologist Michael LeVasseur cautioned against reading too much into those numbers. The virus appears to be deadlier in Italy because the population there is older, and elderly coronavirus patients are the most likely to die. For example, 23% of people in Italy are over age 65, compared with only 14% in South Korea and 16% in the U.S. The age-specific case fatality rates in the three countries are about the same, LeVasseur said. He also pointed out that the curve epidemiologists keep talking about depicts the number of coronavirus patients and hospitals’ capacity to care for them — not deaths caused by the virus. ""Flattening the curve"" means slowing the virus’ rate of transmission and reducing the number of new cases so that fewer sick people need to seek treatment all at once. The latest data on coronavirus cases show that South Korea did flatten the curve, while case counts in the United States and Italy keep climbing. Another way to compare the virus’ impact in the three countries is to look at their economies. Fitzpatrick’s comments came amid a discussion with Giordano about the economic pain the virus has already inflicted on Pennsylvania business owners, and how much longer the closures ordered by Gov. Tom Wolf might last. The congressman argued that businesses need to know when things will go back to normal if they have any hope of surviving this crisis. In South Korea, businesses have remained open even as the country fights the virus, whereas in Italy, businesses have been closed for weeks. The latest modeling suggests the outbreak will peak in the United States in two weeks. But that doesn’t mean that Pennsylvania businesses should necessarily expect to reopen by May, said Nate Wardel, a spokesperson for the State Department of Health. The scarcity of coronavirus tests and the time it takes to get results remain the biggest hurdles to relaxing restrictions. Asked whether Wolf would use the state’s case fatality rate to determine when businesses may reopen, Wardle said it would be one of several metrics used to make that call. And no, he said, the similarity between the fatality rate in the United States and South Korea doesn’t mean Pennsylvania is ready for South Korea-style normalcy. Fitzpatrick said the spread of the coronavirus in the United States matches the spread of the virus in South Korea, not Italy. The U.S. and South Korea have similar case fatality rates — Italy’s is higher — but all three countries have age-specific mortality rates that are about the same. In addition, public health experts say the fatality rate wouldn’t be the only or the most important metric used to determine when businesses may reopen. The growth in cases and hospitals’ capacity to treat new patients is the most important factor, and in that department, the United States looks more like Italy than South Korea.

Will homemade masks stop coronavirus from spreading? Fact-checking Sen. Pat Toomey’s claim
","Last weekend, U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey recorded a message about how to stop the spread of the coronavirus and posted it on Twitter. His message was simple and direct – start wearing a homemade mask when you leave the house.  ""My mask will keep someone else safe and their mask will keep me safe,"" said Toomey, a Republican from the Lehigh Valley. ""I’m not suggesting this is any kind of guarantee. It probably doesn’t have tremendous value for the person wearing the mask but it probably does significantly reduce the risk that people could inadvertently transmit it."" Since masks for health care workers are in such short supply, we wondered whether Toomey’s claim is true.  For weeks, public health officials advised healthy Americans not to wear masks. But on Friday, President Donald Trump announced that the guidance had changed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now urging everyone to wear homemade cloth masks when they leave the house, just as Toomey called for a week ago. He was the first member of Congress to advocate for the shift.  But even as Trump announced the new rules, he said he didn’t plan to follow them himself.  ""It’s voluntary so you don’t have to do it,"" Trump said at Friday’s daily coronavirus briefing. ""They suggest it for a period of time. I don’t think I’m going to be doing it."" Trump said the guidance shifted because research indicates that people who are infected with the coronavirus but aren’t showing any symptoms can still transmit the disease. He also reiterated that wearing homemade masks is not a replacement for other strategies such as social distancing and hand-washing. ""We want to make sure everybody understands it’s not a substitute for the presidential guidelines that have already gone out,"" Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, said Thursday. Toomey got another thing right. Homemade masks are significantly more effective at preventing asymptomatic carriers of the virus from accidentally spreading it than they are at shielding a healthy person from contracting it. And the efficacy of any homemade mask depends on how it’s made.  The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and make a tight seal around the wearer’s face. ""Given the current crisis, and lacking an alternative, many layers of densely woven fabric would be the most effective, because it allows for lots of voids in the layers where particles can be trapped,"" Richard Peltier, an assistant professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, told us by email. ""The mask needs to seal as tightly as possible to the face to avoid leaks, though this may not be possible with different designs, fabrics, or face shapes. Thin or porous fabrics are the least likely to be effective."" A study published in October 2010 tested how cloth masks and common fabrics fared when sprayed with aerosols at different speeds. All of the materials performed worse than hospital-grade N95 respirators. But some, such as cotton towels and scarves, were in the range of some surgical masks. The authors cautioned that fabric materials ""show only marginal filtration performance against virus-size particles when sealed around the edges."" Another study from 2013 found that cotton masks only perform about half as well as surgical masks and ""should only be considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from infected individuals."" More recent research had similar results. So at best, using thick or layered fabric to make a homemade mask could be as effective as using some surgical masks. At worst, it prevents at least some of your respiratory droplets from spreading to others while in public. Under ideal circumstances, no face masks are intended to be worn for more than one encounter. That guidance also extends to homemade masks. ""At the end of the day, these cloth masks should be treated as contaminated materials that you bring in to your home — they need to be laundered in hot soapy water, and you’d need to consider sanitizing in bleach or hydrogen peroxide regularly,"" Peltier said. Toomey’s claim that his homemade mask would keep someone else safe and that someone else’s homemade mask would keep him safe matches the latest guidance from the CDC. We rate this statement True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097911980>],/factchecks/2020/apr/01/pat-toomey/will-homemade-masks-stop-coronavirus-spreading-fac/

Facebook post shortchanges relief bill’s assistance for laid-off workers
","It didn’t take long after the enactment of a $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill for critics to blame Democrats for larding it with unnecessary spending. One Facebook post that was shared at least 15,000 times features a photograph of a smiling, young waitress. The text says: ""I lost my job. But I'll sleep better knowing: $25 million of (coronavirus) relief aid went to the Kennedy Center. $350,000,000 went to refugee resettlement. $75 million went to PBS. $25 million went to congressional salaries and expenses. Thanks, Democrats. It couldn't have happened without you."" Some of this text in the post accurately describes elements included in the final version of the bill. However, it also includes some inaccuracies, and the broader depiction of the bill — in which laid-off workers get nothing, at the expense of special interests — is significantly skewed. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We’ll take a look at the text, piece by piece. This is accurate. The funding would go for such purposes as ""deep cleaning,"" maintenance, telework upgrades, employee compensation, rent and utilities for the performing arts center. The Kennedy Center is a federal entity funded by ticket revenue and congressional appropriations, so receiving funding through a congressional bill isn’t unusual. In a statement, the Democratic House leadership said that the Kennedy Center has lost more than $20 million in unrecoverable costs from canceled performances and has lost the ability to generate revenue from ticket sales in the interim. ""Without the assistance in the bill, the Kennedy Center would become completely insolvent and potentially unable to reopen,"" the statement said.  If ""refugee resettlement"" is supposed to mean resettling refugees in the United States, that’s not entirely accurate. The bill doesn’t say specifically where the $350 million earmarked for ""Department of State migration and refugee assistance"" will go, but much of it may end up as humanitarian assistance to other countries as they grapple with internal displacement of individuals and families due to the virus. Indeed, the Trump administration’s State Department touted its role in this regard as recently as a March 27 news release. ""The U.S. Government is leading the world’s humanitarian and health assistance response to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the release said, citing an initial investment of $274 million for other countries in need, plus the World Health Organization and UNICEF, prior to passage of the relief bill. ""We are mobilizing all necessary resources to respond rapidly, both at home and abroad."" This is broadly accurate. The funding is for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which in turn funds public broadcasters such as PBS. The bill provides ""stabilization support"" for stations seeing declines in non-federal revenues. ""Public media stations are the backbone for most communities’ emergency alert, public safety, first-responder and homeland-security services,"" the Democratic leadership statement said. ""If stations are forced to cut jobs, reduce content and services, or close, the nation’s ability to deliver emergency alerts will be significantly diminished."" As with the money for the Kennedy Center, it is standard practice for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to receive its funding from congressional legislation. Social media users might think this refers to a pay boost for lawmakers, but we’ve previously rated that assertion Pants on Fire. Hollander said there is $25 million for the House in the stimulus to support the chamber’s ""capability to telework,"" including equipment purchases and improvements to the computer network. There is also money to reimburse the staff of the House Child Care Center, cover the costs of food service contracts and pay the House sergeant-at-arms. Separately, the Senate is slated to get $10 million from the stimulus; $1 million will go to the sergeant-at-arms’ office to remain available for coronavirus response, while $9 million will be reserved for ""miscellaneous items,"" including reimbursement for workers at the Senate Employee Child Care Center. None of the money in the bill would go toward paying lawmakers anything more than their current salary level. While some of these provisions mirror elements of a bill offered by House Democrats, that bill never received consideration. Instead, the Senate and the House passed a bill drawn up by leading senators of both parties.  The Senate passed the bill 96-0, while the House approved it by a voice vote, a method used for widely supported measures. Because almost all members of both parties approved the bills, Republicans and Democrats alike deserve whatever credit or blame comes from the bill. The biggest misleading element of the post is the notion that the laid-off waitress will get nothing out of the bill. That couldn’t be more wrong. First, assuming she earns less than $75,000 a year, she’ll get $1,200 tax-free from the government, no strings attached. Second, the bill includes historically generous add-on amounts to state unemployment payments. The bill sets aside $260 billion to increase state unemployment payments by $600 a week, or the equivalent of more than $30,000 a year. If the state gives you $400 a week, a fairly typical amount, then you’ll be getting a total of $1,000 a week, or the equivalent of $52,000 a year. (If you made less than this before you lost your job, you’ll actually be earning more than you did previously, at least during the four months provided for in the bill.) The bill also incentivizes states to waive waiting periods for receiving benefits, and provides funds for states to lengthen the time limits for receiving their unemployment benefits by 13 weeks. Meanwhile, in a landmark move, the bill recognizes that gig workers — from freelancers to Uber drivers — need economic assistance in times like these. So they will qualify for the enhanced unemployment provisions in the new bill.  A Facebook post shows a waitress saying, ""I lost my job. But I'll sleep better knowing"" that the coronavirus relief bill included funding for the Kennedy Center, refugee resettlement, PBS, and congressional salaries: ""Thanks, Democrats."" While the post oversimplifies some of those provisions, they are indeed part of the bill.  However, the post gives the strong impression that the bill offers nothing to laid-off workers, and that’s flat wrong. Every American earning less than the income caps will get a $1,200 check, and anyone who starts drawing unemployment payments will see those topped up by additional federal payments of $600 a month. Also, the bill that was passed received almost blanket support from both Republicans and Democrats. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D6DA40>],/factchecks/2020/mar/31/facebook-posts/facebook-post-shortchanges-relief-bills-assistance/

Sen. Bob Corker says the TVA Board of Directors has only one member with “any corporate board experience,” raising questions about its “entire governance structure""
","
Back in 2004, Bill Frist, then Senate majority leader, spearheaded congressional passage of legislation that eliminated the Tennessee Valley Authority's three-member, full-time board of directors and replaced it with a panel of nine part-time directors. Sen. Bob Corker, who succeeded Frist in a Tennessee Senate seat, now says the board isn't working out.

Corker first questioned TVA's governance structure and the qualifications of board members in an August news release. He elaborated in subsequent interviews, telling the Chattanooga Times-Free Press: ""As you look at TVA today as an $11 billion-a-year company with tremendous challenges, it has a board of directors with the qualifications that I think would cause most Tennesseans to be very concerned. . . . We have only one person on the board, to my knowledge, who even has any corporate board experience.""

We understand that picking TVA board members involves a political process -- they're nominated by the president and must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. But has that really left governance of a governmental agency with $11 billion in revenues and almost $30 billion in debt to folks without appropriate corporate management experience?

As a starting point, it should be noted that the board, authorized for nine members, currently has just six and two of those have terms that will expire at the end of this year. President Obama nominated Peter Mahurin of Bowling Green, Ky., as a new board member in February, but there has so far been no Senate committee hearing scheduled on his confirmation.

It's thus at least possible the TVA board could lack a quorum of five members for meetings by the end of the year. That, setting aside qualification questions, would raise concern for whether the board could even function.

The one board member who Corker counts as having corporate board experience is Bill Sansom, the chairman. He is the longtime chairman and CEO of H.T. Hackney Co., a Knoxville firm in the wholesale grocery and furniture manufacturing business.

The other five sitting members:

-- Marilyn A. Brown of Atlanta, a professor of energy policy at Georgia Technological Institute and a ""distinguished visiting scientist"" at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

-- William Graves of Memphis, who retired in 2010 as presiding bishop of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church and who served on the board of Memphis Light, Gas and Water.

-- Barbara S. Haskew of Chattanooga, an economic professor at Middle Tennessee State University who previously served as dean of the College of Business Administration and worked for eight years as a TVA manager.

-- Richard Howorth, founder and owner of Square Books, an independent bookstore with two affiliates operations who is a past chairman of the American Booksellers Association. He served eight years as mayor of Oxford, Miss., and chaired the Oxford Electric Authority.

-- Neil McBride, an Oak Ridge lawyer and adjunct professor at the University of Tennessee School of Law who is also general counsel for the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands.

Brown and Graves are the board members with terms expiring this year.

Of this group, it would appear that Howorth might come closest to Sansom in business management background. In a telephone interview, Howorth declined to address Corker's comments directly, but said he does believe his background has provided ample executive experience to oversee TVA's operations.

""If I didn't, I wouldn't have agreed to take the job,"" Howorth said.

He spent 11 years on the board of directors of the American Booksellers Association, including two years as president and chairman, Howorth said. The association, a non-profit corporation, had a $40 million budget and the position ""required a great deal of engagement,"" he said. Serving as a city's chief executive officer and as chairman of the electric board could also be viewed as the equivalent of corporate board experience, he suggested.

There's also the pending nomination of Mahurin, who is chairman of Hilliard Lyons Financial Services and who serves on five other corporate boards of directors, according to the White House press release announcing his nomination. Hilliard Lyons has 400 financial consultants operating in 12 states, according to the company website.

And some might see Graves' service on the board of MGLW, which serves some 430,000 customers, as providing an appropriate boardroom background though the ministry has been his primary profession.

A call to Corker's office for elaboration on his comments brought a return call from the senator himself.

""This is no way an attempt take shots at anyone,"" he said. ""It's really about the federal process.""
For presidents of both political parties, he said, appointment of TVA directors is ""a hassle and to some degree an annoyance"" that at times seems to involve ""just crossing ""Ts"" and dotting ‘Is’ for political considerations.""

""TVA is not that important overall to the federal government and certainly not to administrations of either ilk,"" he said. ""It is extremely important to Tennessee. A big part of our economic future depends on TVA.""

Corker said there is a need to ""come up with a remedy"" that meets needs all people in the TVA valley and indicated he will be engaged in that process, though declining to be specific about what reforms are in order.

The senator did not retreat from his contention that the board today is short on the corporate board experience needed for running an enterprise holding a regional monopoly in power production, though he repeatedly emphasized he was not criticizing anyone individually.

""Who knows? We may have four of five of the most stellar people on earth put forward to run TVA,"" he said. ""But that hasn't happened before.""

Corker expressed doubt about whether running a bookstore or even a national booksellers association counts as corporate board experience. As for the pending nomination Mahurin, Corker said ""it sounds like he does have some experience"" and that he hopes to learn more about the nominee's qualifications and background.

Our ruling

 Corker’s point holds up, though we did find some other board members with experience they believe is equivalent to the corporate board experience the senator wants. Since that context was missing, we rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097697940>],/factchecks/2012/aug/26/bob-corker/sen-bob-corker-says-tva-board-directors-has-only-o/

U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse says proposal would keep Social Security, solvent through 2033, alive for 75 additional years
","
With Social Security paying out more money than it has taken in and a growing number of baby boomers swelling the retirement rolls, there's concern that the Social Security trust will run out of money.

There are several proposals for extending the life of the fund. To mark an Aug. 15 visit to a group of East Providence seniors, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse's office issued a news release mentioning one of them. We found it on his website.

""For Social Security, which is projected to remain solvent through 2033, Whitehouse has cosponsored the Keeping Our Social Security Promises Act, which would raise the cap on Social Security payroll taxes to include income over $250,000. By doing so, the bill would extend the life of the program by an additional 75 years.""

We had seen a different projection for when the Social Security trust fund is expected to run out of money. We also wondered if something as simple as lifting the payroll tax cap would provide a funding solution through 2108.

We were right. The projection has changed, and not for the better.

According to the 2011 Annual Social Security and Medicare Trust Fund Reports, the interest earned from investing trust fund money into U.S. Treasury bonds -- combined with money collected each year from Social Security taxes -- will cover the costs of the program through 2022. After that, Social Security will have to start tapping the principal as well as the interest. That principal will be depleted in 2036.

But those numbers are outdated.

Whitehouse was actually citing the key number from the 2012 report showing that, as a result of the bad economy, Social Security is draining its trust fund faster than before.

Interest from investments will stop covering the costs of the program in 2021 (not 2022) and the fund's assets will be exhausted by 2033 (not 2036).

So Whitehouse was correct on that count.

Now let's talk about his plan to save it.

Under the current system, Social Security is financed by a flat income tax of 12.4 percent on the self-employed. For people who are employed, the worker and the employer split the tax.

But there's a limit to the amount a person can be taxed. Once a person's income hits $106,800, the tax is frozen. (That $106,800 ceiling goes up as average U.S. wages rise.) Thus, a person earning $106 million annually pays the same amount as someone earning $106,800.

The Whitehouse proposal would remove that cap, but in a somewhat complicated way.

Under the current system, a self-employed person earning $300,000 in 2011 would have paid the Social Security tax only on the first $106,800 of income.

If the Whitehouse proposal had been in place for the 2011 tax year, that same individual would have paid the tax on the first $106,800 and on any income over $250,000 but not on income between $106,800 to $250,000.

Why the gap? Because President Obama promised not to raises taxes on anyone making less than $250,000. (If the $106,800 cap grew to $250,000, the gap would disappear.)

That change would add a lot of cash to the system. But would it be enough to finance Social Security into the next century?

When we contacted Whitehouse's office, spokesman Seth Larson said the wording on the press release had been unclear. Changing the law to lift the cap would not extend the solvency of the trust fund for 75 years beyond 2033. It would keep the program solvent for 75 years beginning now.

Larson said, ""75 years is as far as the actuary projects when looking at long-term solvency.""

To back that up, he sent us a letter from the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration.

In fact, that report, which uses numbers from 2010, does say the proposal would keep Social Security solvent for the next 75 years by raising an estimated $6.5 trillion dollars during that period. It forecasts running out of money by 2088 or sooner, and that's assuming an annual yield of 2.9 percent when the trust fund loans money to the U.S. government to pay expenses.

After our e-mail, Whitehouse's office went to its website and changed the news release. The last paragraph now says: ""Whitehouse has cosponsored the Keeping Our Social Security Promises Act, which would raise the cap on Social Security payroll taxes to include income over $250,000. By doing so, the bill would keep the program solvent for 75 years.""

Our ruling

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said, ""For Social Security, which is projected to remain solvent through 2033, Whitehouse has cosponsored [a bill that] . . . would extend the life of the program by an additional 75 years.""

In fact, removing the income cap for collecting tax money to pay for the program would extend the viability of Social Security for 75 years from now, not from 2033.

Whitehouse's office quickly acknowledged the error.

In this case, we're talking about a difference of 21 years, between 2087 and 2108.

We rate his statement Mostly True.

"['New Hampshire', 'Taxes', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama says a Paul Ryan tax plan would have eliminated almost all of Romney's taxes
","
By his own admission, Mitt Romney pays a lower tax rate than many Americans. But, President Barack Obama says Romney’s rate would be far lower under a plan proposed by the presumptive Republican nominee’s new running mate.

Obama took aim at Romney and his running mate, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, last week in a speech at Windham High School in New Hampshire.

""His new running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a plan that would let Governor Romney pay less than 1 percent in taxes each year,"" Obama told the cheering crowd during the August 18 speech. ""And here’s the kicker, he expects you to pick up the tab.""

Much has been made of Romney’s taxes in recent months, as the millionaire former Massachusetts governor has declined to release most of his returns. But saying he would pay next to nothing in taxes each year under Ryan’s plan is a new one.

We decided to crunch the numbers.

Over eight terms in Congress, Ryan has introduced a number of budget plans with a range of tax reforms. So, to figure out which plan the president was referring to, we approached the Obama campaign, which pointed us to Ryan’s first proposal, A Roadmap for America’s Future.

Ryan first introduced this plan in 2010, before he became chairman of the House Budget Committee. He proposed at the time to do away with taxes on interest, dividends and long-term capital gains, among other reforms.

The plan stalled in committee and never reached the House floor for a vote. And Ryan and other House Republicans moved away from the tenets of the original plan with their later budget proposals, which included taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains.

ABC News noted recently that Romney himself criticized a similar proposal during a January debate. The plan, introduced by Republican challenger and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, also proposed to do away with capital gains taxes.

""Under that plan, I'd have paid no taxes in the last two years,"" Romney told Gingrich, according to the debate transcript.

But, several major publications, along with Obama, place the number at closer to 1 percent.

Both Roll Call and the Atlantic have published stories in recent weeks reporting Ryan’s plan would have left Romney paying a tax rate of 1 percent or less. Each story based its calculations on Romney’s 2010 tax return-- the most recent one released.

In his 2010 return, Romney reported $21.6 million in income. But, of that total, none of it came from wages or salary, according to federal tax documents. Instead, most of Romney’s income came from capital gains ($12.5 million), dividends ($4.9 million), and taxable interest ($3.3 million), among other sources that would no longer be taxed under Ryan’s plan.

On top of those figures, the Roadmap plan proposed to eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax, on which Romney paid nearly $233,000 in 2010, and it would have cut the top marginal tax rate from 35 to 25 percent on income over $100,000. This would have reduced the taxes Romney paid that year on his business income, about $594,000, much of which came from book and speaking fees.

In his Roll Call story, Steven T. Dennis didn’t identify an exact tax rate, but he reported that these new deductions would amount to 95 percent of Romney’s income that would no longer be taxed under Ryan’s plan.

""It's not certain exactly how low Romney's tax bill would go, but his income from other sources amounts to about $1 million,"" Dennis wrote in the Aug. 11 story. ""Romney's total tax bill would have dropped from the $3 million that he paid to a few hundred thousand dollars if Ryan's plan had been in effect.""

In his Atlantic piece, reporter Matthew O’Brien takes his calculations a step further, totaling the amount Romney would have paid under the Ryan plan at just north of $175,000.

That number reflects the elimination of interest, dividends and capital gain taxes, as well as the Alternative Minimum tax, O’Brien wrote in an email to PolitiFact. It considers the lower top marginal rate proposed under the plan, and it maintains the self-employment taxes that Romney paid in 2010, he wrote.

""Now, Romney would still owe self-employment taxes on his author and speaking fees, but that only amounts to $29,151,"" O’Brien wrote in the Atlantic article. ""Add it all up, and Romney would have paid $177,650 out of a taxable income of $21,661,344, for a cool effective rate of 0.82 percent.""

Tax analysts across the country haven’t repeated O’Brien’s math exactly, but, looking at Ryan’s plan, they feel the numbers are right on.

""The rough calculation by Matt O’Brien strikes me as reasonable. … The bottom line is that given that we know the vast majority of Gov. Romney’s income falls into the categories of interest, dividends, and capital gains, he would no doubt pay a far lower rate  …,"" said Joseph Rosenberg, a research analyst with the Tax Policy Center, in an email.

The policy center is a joint venture between the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.

""Very little of (Romney’s) income is from ordinary working or business income,"" added Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at center. ""Given the amount of itemized deductions he had, at least on the 2010 return, that would wipe out close to all of them. … When you’re Mitt Romney, that’s a very good deal.""

Our ruling:

It’s important to note that Ryan’s most recent budget proposal does not eliminate taxes on interest, dividends and long-term capital gains. Obama is correct, however, to suggest that Ryan at one point put forward a plan that would have eliminated them.

It’s hard to say how that budget proposal would have affected Romney’s tax rate for ""each year."" Romney hasn’t released his tax returns before 2010, and his 2011 documents aren’t finalized yet. But, looking at the snapshot of his 2010 return, it’s safe to say his tax rate would have taken a nose dive.

More than $20 million of Romney's $21.6 million income that year came from interest, dividends and capital gains -- items that would no longer be taxed under Ryan’s plan. Factor in a reduction in the top marginal tax rate and the elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax, and Romney’s tax rate would have fallen dramatically, almost surely reaching below 1 percent, according to media reports and tax analyses.

Paul Ryan says his plan would not affect current Medicare benefits
","
Paul Ryan knew he would get a big response when, during a rally for Mitt Romney at a Florida retirement community, he asked people to raise their hands if they are 55 or over.

He wanted to reassure the seniors in the crowd about the Republican presidential ticket’s plans for Medicare, the government health insurance program serving 39 million seniors.

""Our solution to preserve, protect and save Medicare does not affect your benefits,"" Ryan, Romney’s vice presidential pick, said during an Aug. 18, 2012, stop at The Villages.  ""Let me repeat that -- our plan does not affect the benefits for people who are in or near retirement.""

Really? The truth is not as clear as Ryan makes it appear.

We know Ryan and Romney are pushing for Medicare reforms that would spare beneficiaries 55 and over. Their proposals would create voucher-like credits for future retirees to shop for their own plans, either traditional Medicare or a private plan, starting in 2023. If Ryan were talking only about this part of the plan, he'd be correct.

But Romney and Ryan have also pledged to ""repeal and replace"" the Affordable Care Act, which Ryan attacked several times during his comments. The health law included several new benefits for Medicare.

Here’s an overview of what Obama's health law offers Medicare beneficiaries:

Preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs. Everyone on Medicare is now eligible for free preventive care as a result of President Barack Obama’s health care law. Seniors’ annual wellness visits would be covered, as well as flu shots and a number of screenings for cervical cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, HIV, and cholesterol (complete list is here). These services would not require co-pays.

The ‘doughnut hole.’ The law gradually closes the so-called ""doughnut hole"" for seniors on the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program over 10 years. Before the law, seniors whose annual drug costs exceeded $2,830 shouldered the entire payment without government assistance until they hit an out of pocket limit of $4,550. Once ""catastrophic coverage"" is triggered, the government paid 95 percent of costs.

The health care law gives beneficiaries who reach the doughnut hole a $250 tax-free rebate. Federal subsidies will kick in, gradually reducing the patient’s share of the payment from 100 percent to 25 percent by 2020.

Plus, seniors in the doughnut hole receive a 50 percent discount on covered brand-name drugs.

Restoring $716 billion in Medicare cost savings. Romney has said he will replenish $716 billion in Medicare spending reductions in the health care law over the next decade.

Some analysts say reinstating the savings will will drive up premiums for Medicare Part B beneficiaries, reported the New York Times on Aug. 21, 2012. Premiums are pegged to Medicare’s overall costs, so when costs go up, premiums go up.

Marilyn Moon, vice president and director of the health program at the American Institutes for Research, used official data to compute how out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries might increase. We reached Moon, and she reviewed her methodology with us. 
She calculated that restoring the Medicare spending would raise co-payments and premiums by by $342 a year on average over the next 10 years. By 2022, the annual increase would rise to $577.

The Romney campaign did not refute the Times story. Instead they pointed us to Romney’s campaign website and a memo from campaign policy director Lanhee Chan.

The memo criticizes the Medicare reductions, saying the reduced payments to hospitals will jeopardize seniors’ care and that people on Medicare Advantage, the private-public plan, will lose their coverage.

Romney and Ryan have argued the health care law will hurt seniors, and that it’s better for the market to determine what doctors and hospitals should be paid.

But repealing the law will affect seniors, too.

 Our ruling

Ryan wants seniors to know his and Romney’s Medicare plan ""does not affect your benefits.""  Indeed, that’s the case for their Medicare reform ideas, which would not affect people currently 55 and older.

But his assurance does not take into account one very large elephant in the room: the federal health care law, which alters Medicare primarily by extending more benefits and savings. Romney and Ryan want to ""repeal and replace Obamacare,"" but they haven’t said with what. Repealing the law would take away benefits for current enrollees.

Some experts say it’s unrealistic to expect that level of policy detail. Maybe so, but until the leaders expound upon their plans for closing the doughnut hole for prescription drugs, as well as a number of other Affordable Care Act provisions that would disappear with repeal, we think it’s unrealistic to assure seniors their Medicare provisions wouldn’t change under a Romney-Ryan administration.

Group says Obama administration 'willfully leaked' existence of computer worm used against Iran
","
The group of former special forces soldiers and CIA officers behind the video Dishonorable Disclosure wants to make the case that the Obama administration is more than ready to sacrifice national security if it will boost the president’s popularity with voters. The group goes by the name Special Operations -- OPSEC, which stands for operations security.

We have rated two other claims. One was about the White House working with Hollywood producers and giving away intelligent sources and methods, which we rated Mostly False. The other was about whether the Obama administration gave away the identify of of a Pakistani doctor involved in the effort to find Osama bin Laden, which earned a False.

We now turn to the group's statement about the U.S. cyberattacks on Iran’s nuclear program. In the video, the announcer says, ""This administration willfully leaked the existence of STUXNET, allowing our enemies to learn more of our secrets and of our operations.""

""When we stand up and admit that we were part of putting STUXNET together with our Israeli friends,"" Bill Cowan, a retired Marine Lt. Colonel, said. ""We have really undermined our ability to one, have the Israelis or anyone else work with us on the technology side, and second, we have made it very clear to the Iranians, who did it and who they need to be coming back to pay back.""

We wondered if the Obama administration did reveal the nature of the computer worm STUXNET to the world, whether White House insiders shared information that they shouldn’t have, and in so doing, increased the national security threat to America.

We asked the OPSEC group for supporting information. They referred us to a June 2012 New York Times article and comments from two senators.

 Zeroing in on STUXNET

STUXNET was a complex computer program that infected the centrifuges used by Iran to enrich uranium. It had two main lines of attack. One would take over the centrifuges and cause them to speed up until they shattered. The other component was especially deceptive. It recorded the pattern of normal operations and fed those signals to the machine technicians so they would never see what was actually going on until it was too late. With 15,000 lines of code, it was more sophisticated and, as computer security experts eventually learned, more targeted than any worm seen before. Needless to say, it was intriguing.

Much in the OPSEC claim hinges on what was known at various times, so let's start with a time line.

First, it's important to note there were revelations about a possible U.S. computer attack before Obama took office. When President George W. Bush was in office, he pushed the idea of targeting Iran's computers as an alternative to an Israeli air strike, according to a January 2009 New York Times article. The article relies on unnamed ""senior American and foreign officials"" and says, ""Mr. Bush embraced more intensive covert operations actions aimed at Iran"" that included the possibility of attacking the country's computer systems and networks.

We searched the Nexis database and found the earliest press reports on STUXNET came in late July 2010. Computer security firms had picked up an unusual virus that seemed to be found more in Iran than anywhere else. But there were just five articles in July and only two in August. The articles indicate the information came from private security companies, not the U.S. government.

The number shot up to nearly 150 articles in September. By that time, the experts had begun to pick STUXNET apart -- and they were impressed. Its subtleties and single focus on one type of German-made computer control device attracted a lot of attention. By the end of the month, the British newspaper The Independent, had the headline ""Has West declared cyber war on Iran? Experts say the computer virus found in a nuclear plant is the work of a foreign power.""

By October, reporters were talking about Israel as the likely force behind the virus. In November the Christian Science Monitor wrote of speculation that America and Israel had teamed up to build it. That same month, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad acknowledged that Iranian equipment had been damaged.To some extent, not only was the worm complex, it was also an effective new weapon.

In January 2011 came a more robust linkage to the United States when the New York Times reported that ""strong clues"" pointed to a virus ""designed as an American-Israeli project to sabotage the Iranian program."" The article detailed that U.S. government engineers had studied the vulnerabilities of the control units that ran the Iranian centrifuges. It said those were the access points that STUXNET exploited. It described the kind of centrifuge used in Iran, the so-called P-1, and reported that an ""American expert in nuclear intelligence, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the Israelis used machines of the P-1 style to test the effectiveness of STUXNET.""

The article cited ""officials familiar with the administration’s Iran strategy"" as saying President Barack Obama had ordered researchers to move faster on a Bush administration project to target the electrical and computer systems around Natanz, Iran’s major uranium enrichment facility.

In June 2012, the New York Times reported that Obama personally had endorsed the operation called Olympic Games that produced STUXNET. The article relied on unnamed ""members of the president’s national security team who were in the room"" when the president and his top advisers discussed using the worm. It repeated many of the details in the earlier article but tied STUXNET into a broader strategy. It conveyed the administration’s reservations of unleashing a new form of warfare. It offered the president’s rationale for moving forward: A cyber attack would be better than a bombing run by Israel.

The attribution makes it clear that the Times reporter got considerable information from top officials in the Obama administration. The article cites ""participants in the many Situation Room meetings"" and ""current and former American, European and Israeli officials involved in the program.""

 Congress reacts

Democrats and Republicans in Congress voiced alarm. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif, and Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., the chair and vice-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, issued a joint press release. They called the accelerating pace of leaks ""unacceptable"". They warned that ""these disclosures have seriously interfered with ongoing intelligence programs and have put at jeopardy our intelligence capability to act in the future.""

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., criticized the administration. ""Our friends and allies,"" McCain said on the Senate floor, ""Especially the Israelis, who have been compromised on the STUXNET operation, the virus in the Iranian nuclear program, of course, feel betrayed.

Obama shot back during a press conference.

""The notion that my White House would purposely release classified national security information is offensive. It's wrong,"" Obama said.

Obama said there were mechanisms to track down those who leaked and that if they were found, there would be consequences.

Obama also said ""as I think has been indicated from these articles, whether or not the information they've received is true, the writers of these articles have all stated unequivocally that they didn't come from this White House. And that's not how we operate.""

Actually, the source of the leak remains unclear. The person or persons were pretty clearly part of the administration, which could include the White House staff, the Pentagon or the CIA.

The day of that press conference, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder named two federal prosecutors to investigate possible leaks of classified information by the Obama administration.

 Defining a leak

The New York Times reporter who wrote the June story, David Sanger, was asked many times about White House leaks. On Face the Nation, Sanger diminished the administration’s role in his work.

""I spent a year working the story from the bottom up, and then went to the administration and told them what I had,"" Sanger said. ""Then they had to make some decisions about how much they want to talk about it. All that you read about this being deliberate leaks out of the White House, it wasn't my experience.""

Sanger underscored that the start of the story came when the worm spread out of Iran and was detected by computer security companies around the world. The time line of newspaper activity confirms the intense level of interest in STUXNET within the cyber community. The time line also shows that more than a year earlier, in 2011, a team of New York Times reporters had fleshed out and reported many of the details in the 2012 story with no apparent help from the Obama administration.

As for inflaming Iran’s desire to get even, Sanger was skeptical. ""I would say that the Iranians had figured out two years ago they were being attacked,"" he said. And they ""strongly suspected the United States and Israel.""

But Steve Aftergood with the Federation of American Scientists, is less sanguine about the consequences. While Aftergood agrees that many people knew about STUXNET long before Sanger’s article, the implications of American acknowledgment of its role in unleashing the worm were potentially huge.

""The STUXNET operation was essentially an act of war,"" Aftergood told us. That’s why the sources in Sanger’s story needed to remain anonymous. To speak openly would open create a legal opening for Iran.

""A confirmed U.S. role in the operation would arguably entitle Iran -- under the laws of war -- to take reciprocal, proportionate offensive measures against the U.S., or to seek legal or financial remedies,"" Aftergood said.

 Our ruling

The Special Operations OPSEC group said the administration ""willfully leaked the existence of STUXNET, allowing our enemies to learn more of our secrets and of our operations.""

There are big holes in this argument. As the time line shows, public knowledge of STUXNET long preceded any comment from any Obama administration official. There was extensive coverage and speculation about possible U.S. involvement months before June 2012. Our enemies didn't need the Obama administration to tell them this -- there was plenty of coverage before there was any attribution to Obama's team.

Still, it's clear that the Obama administration provided details -- including a quote from Obama himself in a meeting -- to the New York Times. So the administration -- broadly defined -- confirmed its operational role in the creation of the worm.

"['Gas Prices', 'Wisconsin', 'Billboard']","
Billboard blames Obama for high gas prices
","
There are few expenses that hit drivers and businesses harder in the wallet than high gas prices. So it caught our attention when a new billboard went up in Milwaukee reminding us of the good old days, when gas was below $2 a gallon.

But the billboard, on 35th St. visible, from westbound Interstate 94,  is more than a trip down memory lane. It links high gas prices to the administration of President Barack Obama. This is how it reads:

""Gas $1.85. Obama took office.
Tight drilling regulations. No pipeline.
Obama=Higher Gas.""

There’s a smiley face, and the tagline: ""Authorized and paid for by WI Business Owner.""

Higher gas prices are a familiar complaint of Obama critics. A series of ratings on gas prices can be seen on the national PolitiFact site.

The local message went up on a single billboard during the last week of July, said Mark Rausch, vice president for real estate for Clear Channel Outdoor, the billboard owner. The company charges $6,100 a month for the sign.

Rausch put us in touch with the sponsor of the message, Bret Eulberg, owner of Robert Haack Diamonds, which has stores in Greenfield and Glendale. (There is nothing on the billboard to link the business to the political message.)

Eulberg said customers complain a lot about gas prices, so much so that he gives a $10 gas card to those who sell their gold items to his store.

""I believe the administration has control over the price of oil,"" Eulberg said. He noted it may be better for the environment if people drive less, but it hurts the economy if businesses and consumers have to spend more on gasoline.

There are really two parts to the billboard’s claim -- the price when Obama took over and that the president is to blame for the increase.

Gas prices

According to AAA, the price of a gallon of gas in Milwaukee was $1.97 on Jan. 20, 2009, the day Obama was sworn in. Nationally it was $1.84, and the Wisconsin average was $1.95. (In contrast, on Aug. 15, 2012, prices were about  $3.95 a gallon in Milwaukee, AAA says.)

So Eulberg’s claim on the price is on target. And, he notes, gas was even cheaper in the weeks around the time of the November 2008 presidential election when it dipped to around $1.75 a gallon.

Obama’s role

But is Obama responsible for the pain at the pump? This is where things get more problematic.

We evaluated a similar claim from Eric Hovde, then a candidate in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate on May 4, 2012. Hovde claimed that the economic policies of Obama and Congress and actions of the Federal Reserve are to blame for high gas prices because they led to a devaluation of the dollar. We rated his claim Mostly False, because experts say the devalued dollar has only a small impact on how much we pay for gas.

Obama has taken steps to hold up the Keystone pipeline -- as referenced on the billboard -- which would bring oil from the tar sands in Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.

But have those policies led to higher gas prices?

Let’s start with prices in the fall of 2008, when prices were especially low.

Gas and crude oil prices crashed along with the financial markets that fall, said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst, Oil Price Information Service. Oil prices fell from a national average high of $4.11 in July 2008 to a low of $1.61 on Dec. 30 of that year.

""Oil fell with the financial markets -- there was a massive deleveraging across all asset classes in the second half of 2008 and in much of 2009,"" Kloza said.

He and other experts say that oil prices are set on global markets and there’s little that the president can do to sway them. He also said there’s been a sharp increase in North American crude oil production.

""I don’t think President Obama can take credit for the explosion in North American crude or natural gas output (which is largely a function of price and technology), but he cannot be blamed for high global crude oil, and by extension, high diesel and gasoline prices within the U.S.,"" Kloza said.

The price of oil and, in turn gasoline, is determined by international markets and the amount of domestic consumption has little effect. Booming global demand, especially from China, and tension in the Mideast, are far greater factors.

As for the pipleline, that project wouldn’t be completed for years, and it’s impact on today’s oil markets would be minimal.

Our rating

A billboard sponsored by a local business owner notes that the price of gasoline was much lower when Obama took office -- $1.85 a gallon. That’s about right.

But experts say the president and his policies have little effect on the prices. Demand is skyrocketing in China, and that pushes up prices. There’s been ongoing turmoil in the Mideast. And locally, there have been supply disruptions that have all pushed prices higher. None of these were tied to Obama’s policies.

The blanket claim that Obama is responsible for gas prices doubling gets one part correct: the unusually low price at the start of his administration. The broader claim that Obama is to blame is off base. The statement contains some elements of truth but leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s our definition for Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972A8240>],/factchecks/2012/aug/24/billboard/billboard-blames-obama-high-gas-prices/

No initial impact for city in ""disadvantaged"" airport contractor proceedings
","
The messy, high-stakes process of awarding millions of dollars in contracts to sell food and other stuff at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport managed to get even messier in recent months.

Some winners received special consideration because they count as ""disadvantaged"" firms under federal law, or ones that are run by women or minorities who are small-business owners.

But the Federal Aviation Administration says that four of these businesses don’t qualify as ""disadvantaged"" at all. It’s trying to strip them of their status and asked state officials to start the process.

The state hasn’t, and things are at a standstill.

But if proceedings did start, it would be business as usual for these ""airport concessions disadvantaged business enterprises"" or ACDBEs, said Sonji Jacobs, a spokeswoman for Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed.

It ""has no effect on the concessions contracts or the city's ACDBE goals"" Jacobs told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in an Aug. 10 article.

This perplexed us. This tangle with the feds sounds serious. Will the start of proceedings really have so little impact?

PolitiFact Georgia asked Jacobs and others for more information, and we packed up the Truth-O-Meter for an excursion into the murky world of federal contracts, regulations and diversity goals.

Bear with us. It’s complicated.

Hartsfield-Jackson receives millions of dollars in transportation funds from the U.S. Department of Transportation for things such as upgrading runways or terminals.

These dollars come with strings attached.

The federal government requires the city-run airport to try to give ""disadvantaged"" small businesses a certain percentage of the aviation hub’s lucrative contracts.

In Georgia, the state Department of Transportation figures out whether certain contractors meet the federal definition of ""disadvantaged.""

Businesses gain this certification if ""socially and economically disadvantaged individuals own at least a 51 percent  interest and also control management and daily business operations,"" according to the federal Department of Transportation’s Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization.   

Also, the net worth of owners and the money the business makes can’t exceed federal limits.

If a disadvantaged business wins a city contract, it counts toward the airport’s diversity goals, which helps the city stay in the good graces of the federal DOT.

If the airport doesn’t meet its goals, that may be fine as well. The city doesn’t have to meet a diversity quota, according to the regulations. It simply has to act ""in good faith"" to get there.

But FAA officials think Hartsfield-Jackson contractors Atlanta Restaurant Partners, Vida Concessions Inc. and Hojeij Branded Foods fell short because minorities do not truly control them.

The FAA also said the personal net worth of Mack II’s owner was too high, and he did not provide enough documentation. They ordered GDOT to begin decertification proceedings earlier this month.

Now, back to our fact check. To prove that the start of decertification proceedings ""has no effect on the concessions contracts or the city's ACDBE goals,"" Jacobs pointed us to federal regulations for the disadvantaged business program.

We asked an FAA spokeswoman for her input. She referred us to these regulations as well.

We took a look and found that they tell cities and others that receive federal transportation money that a business keeps its disadvantaged business status until proceedings are over:

""A firm remains an eligible DBE during the pendency of your proceeding to remove its eligibility,"" Title 49 states.  

Since there is no change in status, there’s no change in whether the airport meets its disadvantaged business goals.  

The decertification process could take months. These businesses have a right to a hearing. If they lose, they can appeal to the federal DOT. If this fails, they can dispute the decision in federal court.

Even if these four businesses lose their status, their contracts may stand. We found no regulation that states that the federal DOT has the power to order the airport to drop a contract if a business is decertified.

It may, however, mean the city fails to meet its disadvantaged business goals, according to the regulations.

Such a failure wouldn’t necessarily mean Hartsfield-Jackson will face punishment.

""You cannot be penalized, or treated by the Department as being in noncompliance with this rule, because your DBE participation falls short of your overall goal, unless you have failed to administer your program in good faith,"" regulations state.

Jacobs has it right. If GDOT begins proceedings to revoke the disadvantaged business status of these four businesses, their status will stand until the efforts are finished. And even then, their contracts could remain in effect.

We rule Jacobs’ statement True.

Jim Renacci says Betty Sutton, Democrats gutted Medicare by $741 billion to pay for Obamacare
","
Mitt Romney rekindled a heated debate over Medicare by picking U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate.

Ryan, head of the Budget Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, is the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare, which today operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65.

Democratic congressional candidates are making the protection of traditional Medicare a centerpiece of their campaigns.

The Republican response has been to attack back. In a series of news releases dealing with the national health care reform law, the National Republican Congressional Committee on Aug. 14 claimed 37 House Democrats are ""gutting $741 billion from Medicare"" to pay for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

One of those 37 Democrats was Rep. Betty Sutton. GOP Rep. Jim Renacci, her opponent in Ohio's newly redrawn 16th congressional district, repeated the claim the next day in a campaign fundraising email. 
""We all know that our seniors were slapped with an estimated $500 billion blow to Medicare in 2010 when President Obama and Betty Sutton pushed through their healthcare law, which ended Medicare as we know it,"" the message said. ""Now, revised estimates by the Congressional Budget Office reveal Democrats gutted even more from Medicare than we first knew, taking $741 billion from seniors to fund ObamaCare.""  
PolitiFact Ohio was interested.

We have examined the claim that health care reform cuts Medicare by $500 billion on a number of occasions. The most recent was last May, when Renacci's campaign website said Sutton ""gutted Medicare by $500 billion"" to fund Obamacare.

We rated that statement Mostly False.

How did the claim climb from $500 billion to $741 billion?

Renacci's email said: ""Revised estimates by the Congressional Budget Office reveal Democrats gutted even more from Medicare than we first knew, taking $741 billion from seniors to fund Obamacare.""

We asked Renacci's campaign how he backs up the statement. Except for the revised estimate from the Congressional Budget Office, the backup matched the sourcing for the earlier claim with $500 billion.

Let's review, with the revised estimate.

First, Obamacare does not literally cut a dollar amount from the Medicare program’s budget. Rather, spending will grow.

But the health care law instituted a number of changes to slow the program’s future spending growth and try to contain future health care costs in the program. At the time the law was passed, those savings amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years.

At the time the health care law was being finalized and passed, Democrats said it was important to them that the new law not add to the deficit. So savings in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law’s new spending. That spending is primarily to cover the uninsured, by giving them tax credits to buy private insurance. But some new spending increases Medicare coverage for prescription drugs for seniors.

The efforts to limit future growth were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries.

The law makes significant changes to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.

Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.

Obama and fellow Democrats say the intention is to protect beneficiaries' coverage while forcing health care providers to become more efficient.

Under the new law, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget.

Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the figure for the savings also increases. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law’s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has risen past $700 billion.

The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In its latest estimate released last month, the budget office looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law would reduce future Medicare spending by $716 billion. The $741 billion cited by the RNCC and Renacci includes that Medicare spending and money for other federal programs.

So it is timing that's making the figures bigger, not changes to Medicare. The claim that Democrats support ""gutting"" Medicare is wrong -- program spending will still increase under Obamacare, but at a slower pace.

There is an element of truth in Renacci’s claim. The health care law seeks to reduce future Medicare spending, and the tally of those cost reductions over the next 10 years is $716 billion.

But describing those savings as cuts that gut Medicare suggests a slashing of programs that is not in the law.

On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097718FC0>],/factchecks/2012/aug/24/jim-renacci/jim-renacci-says-betty-sutton-democrats-gutted-med/

Barack Obama ad says Paul Ryan’s Medicare plan could raise costs for Medicare beneficiaries by $6,000 each
","
Editor’s note: After we originally published this item, we received several emails questioning our ruling and pointing us to a new study on the Medicare Advantage program. We reviewed that evidence, considered the arguments of those who disagreed with us and reconsidered our original rating of Mostly True. (Read the archived original version.) Here, we’ve incorporated the new evidence into our original story and issued a new rating of Half True.

In the latest salvo in a growing battle over Medicare, President Barack Obama’s campaign has released an ad that criticizes the Mitt Romney-Paul Ryan ticket over Ryan’s plan for Medicare.

The ad, called ""Facts,"" touts support for his own approach to Medicare from the AARP -- the organization representing older Americans -- as well as AARP’s criticism of Ryan’s proposal. (After the ad’s release, AARP issued a statement to clarify that it was not involved in the making of the ad, though the statement didn’t dispute the ad’s use of AARP’s previous written comments.)

At one point, the narrator says that ""experts say (Ryan’s) voucher plan could raise future retirees’ costs more than $6,000."" An on-screen visual adds the text, ""Raise seniors’ costs by $6,400 a year. Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 4/8/11.""

Is this accurate? Only partly so. We’ll take a look at why.

The Romney-Ryan Medicare plan

As we’ve noted, Ryan released his initial Medicare plan in early 2011. Under this plan, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums.

This would have affected people who today are under 55 only, but critics said those who fell under the new rules would face an increasingly large gap between what the government paid for their benefits and what their health care services cost.

The plan was approved by the GOP-controlled House before dying in the Senate, where Democrats called it radical and harmful to beneficiaries. Subsequently, Ryan offered updated versions of the plan, the first in conjunction with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and then as part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal. Ryan’s most recent plan is similar to his original one, with two key differences. The newer version allows beneficiaries under 55 a choice -- they can use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. Meanwhile, the size of the payment would be set by the market -- the price of the second-cheapest plan.

So is the most recent Ryan plan also official policy for the Romney campaign? It appears to be. In an interview with a Green Bay, Wis., television station on Aug. 15, Romney said, ""Paul Ryan and my plan for Medicare, I think, is the same, if not identical -- it's probably close to identical.""

This history is important because of how the Obama campaign frames the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan in the ad.

The $6,400 question

The ad documents its claim of a $6,400 increase in out-of-pocket costs by citing a report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. Here’s what the group said:

""In 2022, the first year the voucher would apply, (the Congressional Budget Office) estimates that total health care expenditures for a typical 65-year-old would be almost 40 percent higher with private coverage under the Ryan plan than they would be with a continuation of traditional Medicare,"" center president Bob Greenstein wrote. ""CBO also finds that this beneficiary's annual out-of-pocket costs would more than double — from $6,150 to $12,500. In later years, as the value of the voucher eroded, the increase in out-of-pocket costs would be even greater.

The difference between $12,500 (the out-of-pocket costs under the Ryan plan in 2022) and $6,150 (the out-of-pocket costs that year under traditional Medicare) is $6,350, which is very close to $6,400.

In an interview, Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, emphasized that the numbers his group used come from CBO, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, and that the center’s role was just to take the CBO analysis and make it ""more understandable.""

In fact, different groups have made slightly different calculations of the out-of-pocket increase -- the Kaiser Family Foundation, for instance, tabulated the number to be $6,870 -- but the estimates we’ve seen are all in the same ballpark.

But here’s the problem: The CBO analysis, and the other groups’ analyses that were built on those CBO numbers, refer to the original Ryan plan, not to the current one. The current plan is slightly more generous in how fast it allows subsidies to grow as health care costs increase, while still keeping spending lower than current projections. Ryan also made a number of other technical changes to address concerns that the credits wouldn’t keep up if medical costs kept going up and up. As we mentioned before, the amount a beneficiary receives, for example, would be based on the second least-expensive plan available on a Medicare exchange.

That means while the traditional Medicare offering — if it’s more expensive than the second-least expensive plan — could cost seniors more out-of-pocket, it’s unlikely to cost them as much as estimates for Ryan’s earlier plan.

Of course, it’s still not clear what would happen over time if those market-based payments grew faster than the Ryan plan’s cap on Medicare spending. Would savings still come from beneficiaries? Or providers? Or somewhere else?

""CBO has not analyzed the policies that might be implemented to produce such a path for Medicare spending, including a premium-support approach to Medicare of the sort that Chairman Ryan and other Members of Congress have recently discussed,"" CBO wrote earlier this year.

The Obama campaign said it would be happy to update its numbers if CBO or the Romney-Ryan campaign provided new data, but neither has. Peter Orszag, Obama’s former Office of Management and Budget director, recently wrote that ""if Ryan believes that changes to his plan since (the original plan was released) would result in any different conclusions, he should request that CBO publish an updated analysis.""

But there is one clue that the number wouldn’t be close to $6,400. A study published Aug. 1, 2012, in the Journal of the American Medical Association says that if Ryan’s plan had been in place in 2009, the cost of the second-cheapest Medicare Advantage plan (and thus the size of the premium support payment) would have been 9 percent less than traditional Medicare.

That would have required an out-of-pocket payment for seniors who wanted to use traditional Medicare of $64 a month — which adds up to less than $800 a year.

But the absence of data means that analyzing the impact of the new Ryan plan is speculative. Van de Water told PolitiFact that, in the absence of specifics, ""I wouldn’t want to speculate on what a new CBO estimate would show. ... Since Ryan has advanced many different versions of premium support, one should specify which version one is talking about.""

But despite such concerns, Van de Water did say that the Obama campaign’s decision to use the old numbers was defensible. ""It also seems reasonable to cite the most recent available analysis"" when Ryan has not provided enough detail to do a new one.

Our rating

The Obama ad would have been more accurate if it had specified that it was referring to a previous Ryan plan for Medicare rather than the current one. We simply don’t have enough details to know how much extra money seniors might have to pay under the current Ryan plan. Still, the Obama campaign gave itself some wiggle room by saying that the plan ""could"" raise out-of-pocket costs by more than $6,000. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3F4A00>],/factchecks/2012/aug/23/barack-obama/barack-obama-ad-says-paul-ryans-medicare-plan-coul/
"['Oregon', 'City Government', 'Nick Fish']","
Do cities really save $38 for every $1 they spend on fluoridation?
 ","
The Portland City Council is set to vote early next month on whether to fluoridate the city’s drinking water -- and a ‘yes’ vote looks all but certain. City Commissioner Nick Fish said as much in a statement that started bluntly ""I believe it is time to add fluoride to Portland’s drinking water.""

Part of his rationale, he explained in the statement, are the potential savings fluoridation offers.

""In fact, cities save an estimated $38 in dental costs for every $1 invested in fluoridation,"" he wrote. 
We thought the topic was timely enough that we ought to do a quick check on this would-be fact. (Full disclosure: The Oregonian used the same fact in a Page 1 article on the subject of fluoridation.)

We called Fish’s office and spoke with Emily York, one of the commissioner’s policy coordinators. She sent us a fact sheet from the Everyone Deserves Healthy Teeth Coalition that laid out the economic case in favor of fluoridation, including the $38 figure that Fish used.

The figure, the fact sheet noted, came from a 2001 study published in the Journal of Public Health Dentistry by Susan Griffin, Karl Jones and Scott Tomar.

It took some time, but we were able to get our hands on a copy of the study. A quick read revealed that the authors had indeed found significant savings from fewer instances of tooth decay and resulting dental care when communities fluoridated their water supplies. (PolitiFact Oregon recognizes that fluoridation has strong opponents who raise other issues -- but our purpose here is simply to examine the possible cost savings.)

To get to the $38 figure, you need to do a little math. For a large community like Portland, the study’s authors estimated that fluoridation costs about 50 cents per person. Then it goes on to give a range of possible dental cost savings per person --  from $2.99 to $56.07, with a most likely savings (base case in financial jargon) of $19.12 per person for the 50 cents spent

Just double the $19.12 in savings -- because that’s how much you get for half a dollar -- and you wind up with $38 in savings for each $1 spent. That’s a pretty decent return, to be sure.

Now, there are a few caveats here. The study explicitly states that it does not take into account overhead costs of fluoridation or possible health issues that stem from fluoridation, such as dental fluorosis, which the study says ""are negligible.""

We contacted one of the study’s authors, Scott Tomar, who teaches at the College of Dentistry at the University of Florida. In an e-mail he said the bottom line of the decade-old study was that ""that community water fluoridation saves money under almost any scenario. It is actually one of extremely few public health initiatives that can make such a claim.  Based on our analyses, an 18 to 1 return on investment is a reasonable estimate for Portland.""

We wanted something a little more specific, however, so we took a look at the actual numbers Portland would be facing. The figures are a little different for the Portland area because it’ll cost more than the estimated 50 cents per person to fluoridate. According to early estimates, it’ll cost the city about $5 million to get the project started and then about $575,000 annually from there on to fluoridate water for about 900,000 people.

We worked the math and that means in the first year, Portland area residents would save about $3 in dental costs for every $1 invested. After that, it’d cost closer to 64 cents per person to fluoridate the water, meaning a savings of about $30 for each $1 spent.

Fish was measured in his comments. He said that ""cities save an estimated $38 in dental costs for every $1 invested in fluoridation"" and, indeed, that was the estimate of one article that appeared in a peer-reviewed medical journal. Furthermore, the findings of this article are highlighted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its website on the subject.

The savings for Portland, however, are slimmer, and we think that’s important context that is missing.

We find this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AF0140>],/factchecks/2012/aug/23/nick-fish/do-cities-really-save-38-every-1-they-spend-fluori/

Charlie Bass accused of taking money from Big Oil
","
Campaign season, just like baseball season, is entering the stretch run. And, according to one political action committee, Congressman Charlie Bass is more than willing to play ball with big oil.

In an advertisement released earlier this month, Friends of Democracy, a PAC pushing for campaign finance reform, accuses Bass, a New Hampshire Republican, of accepting thousands from oil and gas companies.

""Your Congressman, Charlie Bass, took over $166,000 from Big Oil,"" a narrator says in the ad, which features three baseball fans entering a nearly empty stadium only to be told by two corporate lobbyists that their seats are taken.

""If we don’t vote against Charlie Bass, middle class families will never get into the game.""

Friends of America, founded by Jonathan Soros, the son of noted liberal activist George Soros, is spending $700,000 to air a series of ads, which take aim at Bass and three other Congressmen, Chip Cravaack, of Minnesota, Sean Duffy, of Wisconsin and Dan Lungren, of California.

We’ll leave it to other states to look into the other ads. But, are they true here in New Hampshire? PolitiFact is on the case.

To start, we approached Friends of Democracy, which directed us to the Public Campaign Action Fund, a non-profit group that seeks to improve campaign finance laws. As part of its mission, the group analyzes campaign contributions for select Congressional races, according to Executive Director David Donnolly, who also helped to found the Friends of Democracy Group.

In this case, the Action Fund conducted a thorough review of campaign finance data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics. The center, which tracks campaign contributions reported by the Federal Elections Commission through its website OpenSecrets.org, reports that Bass has accepted about $7.5 million in donations from PACs and individuals throughout his career. He served six terms in the House of Representatives between 1994-2006 before returning to Congress in 2010.

Of that $7.5 million total, $147,660 has come from donors within the oil and gas industry, and that counts only those donations over $200, so ""he’s probably got a lot more than that,"" said Russ Choma, a reporter with OpenSecrets.

""If you give less than $200, the campaign still collects information, but it’s not broken out the same way,"" Choma said. ""We don’t track it the same way.""

According to OpenSecret's calculations, the oil and gas industry doesn’t rank among Bass’ top 10 contributors. Throughout his career, independent Leadership PACs, which can accept and spend unlimited amounts of money, have donated more than $760,000 to Bass’ campaigns. 

Donors who listed their occupation as ""retired"" have contributed more than $469,000; and representatives from the insurance industry have added more than $285,000.

Based on these numbers, oil and gas rank 12th among Bass’ biggest donors, and the industry’s $147,660 total falls nearly $20,000 short of the Friends of Democracy claim.

Donnolly, who helped to found the group, says the discrepancy comes from further vetting the numbers. In monitoring Bass’ election, campaign fund workers reviewed all the donations tracked by the responsive politics center, including those that were not coded oil and gas.

In the end, they found 192 total donations between 1994-2012 from individuals or groups associated with gas or oil companies. Together, the donations added up to $166,210, according to the campaign fund. 
The Center for Responsive Politics ""does amazing work, but they’re tracking, in any election cycle, close to 500 races,"" Donnolly said. ""Sometimes things fall through the cracks. … We go in and clean up the data for just the races we’re looking at."" 
By either calculation, the ad’s numbers are on target, or at least very close. But does that make the claim that Bass took the money from Big Oil true? To answer that, we have to look at the definition of Big Oil.

In its work, OpenSecrets refrains from using the term Bil Oil, referring instead to gas and oil industry contributions. The category includes a range of public and independent oil and gas producers and refiners, natural gas pipeline companies, fuel oil dealers and gasoline service stations, among others. 
""The definition of Big Oil is subjective,"" said Chera, of OpenSecrets. ""We're careful to define it just as we have, as oil and gas.""

Still, other organizations use the term more freely. Both Friends of Democracy and the Public Campaign Action Fund consider ""Big Oil"" as representing the oil and gas industry on the whole, considering any and all contributions from related individuals and groups.

""If someone works as an executive in the finance industry, they're often called part of Wall Street industry,"" said Donnolly, the action fund’s director. ""These are terms to help voters understand what we're talking about.""

But, other industry professionals take a different view. Bloomberg’s BusinessWeek magazine, for instance, considers Big Oil to be the five or six major publicly owned gas and oil companies. ""ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron, Shell and formerly BP have been members of Big Oil for years,"" according to the BusinessWeek website. ""Together, they currently produce the majority of the world's crude oil supply.""

Under this definition, a number of the campaign contributions came from Big Oil companies, either through individual donations or through PACs established by the companies. The list includes 10 donations from ExxonMobil, totaling $24,500, as well as eight from Exxon Corp. for $4,500 and three from Mobil Oil for $1,500. ConocoPhillips contributed twice for a total of $3,000, according to the list, and other large multinational gas and oil companies donated, as well, including Chevron Corp. (once for $5,000), Sunoco (twice for $1,500), and Texaco (twice for $1,000).

People connected to several oil and gas interest groups have also contributed to Bass’ campaigns, according to the list - including the American Gas Association, which contributed seven times for a total of $6,500, and the Petroleum Marketers Association (10 times for $12,750).

But, nearly half of the contributions listed by the campaign fund come from donors from smaller, privately owned companies, including people affiliated withAranco Oil Company in Concord, N.H. (27 donations for $14,000), the Johnson & Dix Fuel Corporation in Lebanon, N.H. (11 donations totaling $5,850) and the Peterborough Oil Company of Peterborough, N.H. (eight donations for $4,100).

""The oil industry is larger and more varied than most people outside it realize. Especially in the US, the industry has many quite small independent producers,"" Bob Tippee, editor of the Oil & Gas Journal, wrote in an email.

""The expression ‘Big Oil’ tends to be used dismissively by people who are flummoxed by the size and complexity of an industry, that given the size and nature of the needs it serves, must be large and complex,"" Tippee wrote. ""I don’t know anyone in the industry who uses (the term).""

Our ruling:

After more than14 years in office, Bass has accepted millions of dollars in campaign contributions, including, by most counts, hundreds of thousands from donors within the oil and gas industry. The Center for Responsive Politics tabs the number at about $147,000, while the Public Campaign Action Fund, and subsequently the Friends of Democracy PAC, report $166,000. Either way, the numbers are in the ballpark. What’s off-base is the claim that all the money comes from ""Big Oil.""

Some of the contributions come from people who work forExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and the other multinational gas and oil companies commonly considered ""Big Oil."" But, many come from smaller firms, including locally owned heating companies and gas stations, that do not fall under the category. And as PolitiFact has noted in previous rulings, just because people who work for an industry donate to a campaign, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s coming from the industry itself. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280FF997800>],/factchecks/2012/aug/23/friends-democracy/charlie-bass-accused-taking-money-big-oil/
"['Medicare', 'Florida', 'Paul Ryan']","
Paul Ryan said ""15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats"" could ""lead to denied care for current seniors""
","
Remember the discredited Republican attack that President Barack Obama’s health care law created a ""rationing board"" or ""death panel""?

It’s back — but with a softer edge. And it’s coming from the architect of the lightning-rod Republican plan to turn Medicare into a program that pays for private insurance.

Vice presidential hopeful Paul Ryan claims an ""unelected, unaccountable"" board created by the health care law ""will lead to denied care for current seniors.""

His language is more measured than other claims we’ve weighed over the years about Medicare’s new Independent Payment Advisory Board. But did he reach the truth?

Ryan trotted out the campaign line (and his Medicare-eligible mother, Betty) on  Aug. 18, 2012, in retiree-heavy Florida community The Villages, and repeated it two days later in New Hampshire.

""Here's what the president won't tell you about his Medicare plan, about Obamacare,"" he said. ""The president raids $716 billion from the Medicare program to pay for the Obamacare program. What's more, in addition to that, he puts a board of 15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in charge of Medicare, who are required to cut Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors.""

We’ve evaluated versions of the $716 billion claim, finding that the amount wasn’t ""raided"" or ""robbed"" but that the law reduces future spending through a series of cost-saving measures. (Meanwhile, Ryan’s own House budget took advantage of the same savings he attacks.) Here we’re checking Ryan’s comments about the Independent Payment Advisory Board.

‘Unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats’

The Independent Payment Advisory Board, slated to start work in 2013, was created by the health care law to put distance between politics and Medicare.

(An evenhanded report from the Kaiser Family Foundation describes the board and its origin.)

Its 15 full-time members aren’t elected. But that doesn’t mean they’re unaccountable.

• They’re appointed by the president and approved by the Senate.

• They can’t serve more than two six-year terms.

• Their recommendations can be rejected by Congress.

• They must follow disclosure and ethics guidelines, and they can’t perform other jobs as they serve.

• They can be removed by the president for ""neglect of duty"" or ""malfeasance in office,"" though not for any other reason.

Henry Aaron, an economist who specializes in health care and tax policy at the Brookings Institution, says they’re accountable in the same sense that members of any federal regulatory commission are accountable — they serve fixed terms and can be removed for cause.

But Gail Wilensky, a health economist who directed the Medicare and Medicaid programs from 1990 to 1992 under President George H.W. Bush, argues that all members of independent commissions, once appointed and confirmed ""are almost impossible to move or influence.""

By contrast, she says, other types of presidential appointees, such as Cabinet members, can be pressured to resign if they make serious mistakes.

In addition to limiting the reasons a board member might be removed, lawmakers sought to insulate the board’s decisions from special-interest lobbying.

• Its recommendations are fast-tracked in Congress and go into effect automatically if lawmakers fail to act.

• Implementation of its recommendations isn’t subject to administrative or judicial review.

So, board members aren’t elected, but while their decisions are protected by law, they are to some degree accountable. In particular, they could fail to win a second term, or get fired by the president.

Are they bureaucrats?

They become members of the bureaucracy by definition once they join the board. But they won’t all start that way. The law specifies that members will represent a mix of different professions, from health finance and economics to health facility management to medicine.

In other words, the same kind of people who might advise health care spending decisions outside of government.

‘Required to cut Medicare’

If Medicare grows too quickly, the Independent Payment Advisory Board is required to recommend cuts. But it won’t have as large an impact as you might imagine.

Obama’s health care law, the Affordable Care Act, reduces Medicare’s growth by more than $700 billion over the next 10 years, as we noted above.

How much savings will the board generate? Less than 4 percent of net Medicare savings in the law’s first decade, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Recommendations from the board probably wouldn’t be necessary after that, according to Medicare’s actuary. That’s because it only has to recommend cuts in years that Medicare misses its growth targets. After 2019, other savings in the health care law, if allowed to take effect, would keep the program in check.

So it’s fair to say the bulk of the savings in the law are outside the board’s purview.

It’s only if those other measures fail to keep Medicare spending on track that the board is required to recommend additional ways to save. Meanwhile, if Congress comes up with another way to achieve the savings, it could overrule the board’s proposals.

‘Denied care’

Ryan said the board would ""cut Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors.""

But by law, the board can’t ration care. It can’t change benefits. It can’t change eligibility. It can’t increase what seniors pay.

So it’s expected to cut payments to providers. That could be a problem, since some providers say they’re underpaid already. New York Times and USA Today stories in 2009 and 2010, for example, feature doctors opting out of Medicare because of its low payment rates.

How might that affect care? Imagine, say critics, being unable to find a nearby hospital or doctor who takes Medicare. Or discovering that payments for a particular service or procedure have been reduced.

""In that way, at least in theory, you could get actual denial of care,"" said Michael Tanner, a health care analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, who opposes the health care law.

The Medicare actuary, Richard Foster, estimated that savings from the entire health care law would make about 15 percent of hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies unprofitable by 2019.

That means, presumably, that to stay open they would need to shift costs to non-Medicare patients, merge with other providers or withdraw from Medicare, he said.

That’s one reason he’s testified that growth reduction under the law isn’t sustainable in the long range.

It’s ""a serious issue,"" said Wilensky, the Bush-era Medicare official.

But that’s the projected effect for the entire law. Meanwhile, the board itself is required to consider ""to the extent feasible"" how its recommendations would affect access to care, especially in rural and other underserved areas.

Our ruling

Ryan said that Obama ""puts a board of 15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in charge of Medicare who are required to cut Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors.""

Board members aren’t elected, but it’s a stretch to say they’re entirely unaccountable. They’re appointed by the president and approved by the Senate. The president can fire them for neglect of duty or malfeasance.They’re required to recommend cuts to Medicare in years that other cost-saving measures don’t meet growth targets — but Congress can overrule their recommendations.

Meanwhile, ""denied care"" is a strong way to phrase the board’s possible effect. It’s expected to recommend cutting provider payments, with an eye on cutting waste and inefficiency. That could restrict some seniors’ access to care, depending on the what actions the board actually takes. Meanwhile, the board oversees only a small percentage of the Medicare savings in the health care law.

Ryan creates the specter of an unaccountable board making all of Medicare’s spending decisions, but that’s scarcely the case. There’s an element of truth to his claim, but his overstatements add up to a Mostly False impression.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0C6680>],/factchecks/2012/aug/23/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-said-15-unelected-unaccountable-bureaucr/

Obama ad says class sizes 'don't matter' to Romney
","
A new Barack Obama campaign ad titled ""Children"" attacks Republican Mitt Romney on education by painting him as out of touch with public school students and their families.

In the ad, parents Kevin and Caroline say their children’s best experiences have been in the classroom.

""But Mitt Romney says class sizes don’t matter,"" a narrator interjects.

A photo of Romney appears, along with a Washington Times headline declaring ""Romney downplays value of small class size.""

Many parents have long believed that small class sizes translate into a better education for kids. School districts often boast about having low ratios, which presumably gives teachers more time to focus on each student.

Education Week, a well-respected independent journal, reports that most research supports the idea that small classes have benefits for students but that the smaller classes do not not automatically translate into better learning.

Where does Romney stand on this? We decided to check his record.

What he said

The Washington Times story cited in the ad was about Romney's May visit to a Philadelphia charter school. He joined a roundtable of teachers and talked about his approach to education while governor of Massachusetts.

""I came into office and talked to people, and said ‘What do we do to improve our schools?’ And a number of folks said, ‘Well, we need smaller classroom sizes -- that will make the biggest difference.’ So I gathered information across our state. We had 351 cities and towns. I said let’s compare the average classroom size from each school district with the performance of our students, because we test our kids, and we’ll see if there’s a relationship. And there was not.

""As a matter of fact, the school district with the smallest classrooms, Cambridge, had students in the bottom 10 percent,"" he continued. ""So just getting smaller classrooms didn’t seem to be the key.""

A teacher asked Romney for his views on class size.

He mentioned work by the consulting firm McKinsey Global Institute comparing class size and student performance among several countries. Romney said the study found that ""in schools that are the highest-performing in the world, their classroom sizes are about the same as in the United States. So it’s not the classroom size that’s driving the success of those school systems."" He said factors such as parent involvement, motivated teachers and quality administrators were better drivers of success.

Romney often cites McKinsey's research. His campaign pointed us to similar remarks Romney made in Orlando last September and in Nashua, N.H. in November.

""I plotted the one versus the other, classroom size against student performance. And guess what? There was no relationship at all,"" he said in Orlando.

The Obama campaign also cited his speech in The Villages, a retirement town in central Florida. Romney said Massachusetts data ""showed that classroom size was not relevant in my state to how well the kids were doing.""

Finally, on page 216 of his book No Apology, Romney wrote, ""in the United States, then, the effort to reduce classroom size may actually hurt education more than it helps.""

Romney’s campaign website makes no mention of class size but touts the importance of school choice and expanding access to ""high-quality public charter schools."" His campaign spokesman, Ryan Williams, pointed out that Obama’s education secretary, Arne Duncan, has also expressed skepticism about the emphasis on small classes.

Our ruling

Obama’s ad claims that ""Mitt Romney says class sizes don’t matter.""

That's pretty much what he has said, saying that Massachusetts data ""showed that classroom size was not relevant in my state to how well the kids were doing.""

We rate the claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097298380>],/factchecks/2012/aug/23/barack-obama/obama-ad-says-class-sizes-dont-matter-romney/

Bruce Elfant says 88 Texas constables have died in line of duty
","
The day a Brazos County constable was shot to death in College Station, a Travis County counterpart pointed out that constables often confront risks.

""Texas constables serve as the enforcement arm for our courts,"" Bruce Elfant, the constable for Precinct 5, said in an Aug. 13, 2012, statement emailed to news organizations. ""Every day we carry out court orders to arrest individuals, remove children from abusive conditions, seize property and evict people from their homes. Constables are also responsible for enforcing child-support orders and executing family violence protective orders. Quite often when serving court notices or enforcing court orders constables are confronted with hostility, resistance and, on some occasions, deadly force.""

The statement continues: ""Eighty-eight Texas constables have died in the line of duty while serving their communities.""

We asked Elfant’s office to back up that count.

Elfant, who is also the 2012 Democratic nominee for Travis County tax assessor-collector, said by telephone that he based his figure on adding to a tally of 86 that was part of a video about constables posted a few years ago on the Travis County website. He said he must have miscounted when he penciled in 88.

Elfant said the original count came from information compiled by others. He later forwarded a list that he had fielded from Ron Hickman, the constable in Harris County’s Precinct 4, indicating that 215 constables or officers in constable offices in about 100 counties have died in the line of duty since Oct. 17, 1852. That tally includes150 constables, the list suggests.

About 60 of the deaths occurred in the 1800s with nearly 110 taking place from 1900 through 1939. Eleven took place in the 1940s, none in the 1950s, four in the 1960s -- and 10 through the rest of the last century. The list shows a dozen on-duty deaths since July 2003.

Listed causes of death are topped by gunfire, the cause in about 170 deaths. Less frequent causes include car accidents, heart attacks and stabbings.

By telephone, Hickman told us much of the research was undertaken by volunteers connected to the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, which describes itself as the state’s largest union of law enforcement officers.

By phone, CLEAT spokesman Charley Wilkison told us the group’s members helped spearhead the creation of the Texas Peace Officers’ Memorial northeast of the Texas Capitol. He said the group’s special counsel and former president, Ron DeLord, has long guided volunteer research efforts to confirm officers who died in the line of duty.

Wilkison said volunteer retired police officers comb libraries and cemeteries and other resources, checking on whether officers died in the line of duty. Wilkison said relevant findings are then made available to the agency that determines whose names appear on the memorial, the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Standards and Education.

Kaye Wilson, a commission executive assistant, told us by telephone that as of May 2011, the last time names were added to the memorial, 85 constables were shown as having died in the line of duty. She added by email that this count is likely not complete.

The Elfant-provided list shows three constable officers who have died in the line of duty since then; it does not yet include Brian Bachmann, the Brazos County Precinct 1 constable who died in the College Station shootout.

The count of 85 constables whose names are on the memorial is slightly less than the 88 Elfant originally aired. But it’s considerably less than the 150 tally of constables felled in the line of duty on the list Elfant offered to back up his claim.

Time for subtraction.

We counted more than 30 constables on the non-government list who have yet to be approved to appear on the memorial. At our request, DeLord compared the lists and identified about 30 additional constables whose names are on the memorial but were not shown on the state’s list. Also, he suggested that another one or two on the memorial were identified by the agency as deputy sheriffs but they also were constables. He pointed out that officers on the memorial are not identified by rank.

Ken Mobley, the agency’s legislative liaison, later told us by phone that it’s reasonable to say that at least 115 Texas constables have died in the line of duty. ""It could be more,"" Mobley said.

Our ruling

It may not be settled precisely how many constables have died in the line of duty over the years. But we ultimately found agreement between the agency that oversees the Capitol memorial and outside researchers that the total is at least 115 deaths, not 88. 
Elfant understated the total. His statement still rates as True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978DC480>],/factchecks/2012/aug/23/bruce-elfant/bruce-elfant-says-88-texas-constables-have-died-li/

Crossroads GPS says Baldwin voted to spend $800,000 to replace light bulbs
","
On Day 1 of Wisconsin’s general election contest for an open U.S. Senate seat, Democrat Tammy Baldwin got a scolding from a conservative advocacy group.

""Big spending in Washington is terrible for Wisconsin’s economy, and Tammy Baldwin hasn’t helped,"" a Crossroads GPS TV ad began. ""Tammy Baldwin voted for the failed $1 trillion stimulus, including projects like $800,000 to replace light bulbs.""

The ad includes an image of a standard-issue light bulb, the kind you might have in your living room, and goes on to rip Baldwin, a Democrat from Madison, for trillions being added to the national debt during her 13-plus years in Congress.

We’ve heard a lot of claims over the years about stimulus spending.

But a wasteful $800,000 for light bulbs?

The stimulus bill

Baldwin did vote for the stimulus package, known formally as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009. But it did not carry a $1 trillion price tag at the time.

The 2009 estimate was $787 billion and later revised to $814 billion.

Interest costs on additional debt will bring it over $1 trillion, but Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said it’s somewhat misleading to pin that figure on Baldwin.

So the ad is a bit shaky on the big picture.

Light bulbs

Now let’s try to shed some light on the claim of a wasteful $800,000 in stimulus funds to ""replace light bulbs.""

Crossroads GPS pointed us to a November 9, 2011, online story by
WITI-TV (Channel 6) in Milwaukee that focused on stimulus-funded projects that, in the words of the story, weren’t ""exactly stimulating much of anything.""

The story said the U.S. Department of Energy had ""showered"" the city of Racine with nearly $800,000 in stimulus money, which Racine used to replace street lights with energy efficient LED lights. But, the story said, only one unemployed electrician was needed to install the lights.

So, while the ad leaves the impression these are ordinary light bulbs, that’s far from the case.

As in many other U.S. cities, the Racine money came through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant program. At least 30 cities asked for more than $104 million in federal stimulus funds to help them change to LED (light-emitting diodes), replacing high-pressure sodium lights, USA Today reported in March 2009.

Racine’s total grant was $795,000, but not all of it was for the street lights. A good chunk of it -- about $194,000 -- was for energy audits of homes and loans to residents who wanted to save money through weatherization and other energy-saving changes. Another $79,500 was for administration.

A total of $521,500 was for the new LED lights, with about half for street lights and half for city government buildings, according to Kathleen Fischer, the city’s assistant finance director.

So the Crossroads ad is off on the $800,000 claim as well.

The installation did only result in enough work for one full-time electrician, according to Racine Mayor John Dickert.

But there are a couple other aspects to this.

First, Racine is saving 59 percent on energy costs thanks to the lights. That is projected to amount to about $40,000 a year.

""It was money well spent,"" said Mark Yehlen, commissioner of Public Works. ""We have realized significant savings.""

What’s more, one of the primary suppliers of LED lights for the Racine project was a Racine-area company, Ruud Lighting, that builds the lights.

Ruud has expanded and added jobs while winning contracts to supply LED lights all over the United States to municipalities -- many of them using the federal stimulus dollars flowing through the Department of Energy’s block grant program.

""BetaLED, a division of Ruud Lighting, Inc., is seeing a healthy boost in business as cities tap into their Recovery Act funds..."", a Department of Energy news release said in April 2010.


When Ruud was purchased by Cree Inc. in 2011 and announced job-expansion plans, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker praised the company and said Ruud would be eligible for up to $4 million in state tax credits.

For years, many of the LED conversions involved lights mostly made in Asia, though the lights often were assembled in the United States, PolitiFact National and FactCheck.org found in previous fact checks. That was because the Energy Department initially felt insufficient components were available domestically.

Ruud has won some contracts because it uses more American-made parts than other companies, according to news coverage in Pittsburgh, where it also won work, though not through stimulus funding.

""These ads are really disappointing,"" said Dickert, the Racine mayor. ""They are only telling half the story, if that.""

Our rating

Crossroads GPS charges that Baldwin voted for wasteful spending through a ""$1 trillion stimulus"" plan, specifically citing ""$800,000 to replace light bulbs.""

On both counts, the numbers are too high. While only one job was created to complete the project, city officials say it will save city taxpayers money every year and a growing local company got a big chunk of the contract to make the lights. They are in the midst of a hiring effort and have won stimulus-funded work all over the country.

There’s an element of truth in that federal stimulus money went to buy light bulbs, but overall we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979DC5C0>],/factchecks/2012/aug/23/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-says-baldwin-voted-spend-800000-rep/
"['New Jersey', 'Taxes', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie says he hasn’t raised taxes in New Jersey
","
Gov. Chris Christie said he vowed to the people of New Jersey that he would not raise their taxes and that’s the only oath that matters.

But his allegiance to that pledge falls into murky territory.

""I haven't raised taxes in the time I've been the governor of New Jersey and I didn't need to sign a pledge not to,"" Christie said at an Aug. 20 news conference in Asbury Park when asked about an anti-tax oath signed by many Republicans. ""I made a pledge to the people of the state not to. I don't need to make a pledge to anybody else.""

With Christie expected to flaunt his New Jersey credentials in the keynote address at the Republican National Convention next week, PolitiFact New Jersey wondered whether his tax claim is accurate.

Rates for the state’s three biggest revenue generators -- income, sales and corporation business taxes -- have not gone up under Christie.

But the governor has cut funding for tax credit programs and several experts said those reductions are, in effect, tax increases.

""For practical purposes decreasing tax credits is the same as a tax increase. The person's effective tax rate goes up,"" David Brunori, a research professor of public policy at The George Washington University, said in an e-mail. ""Still, most people think of tax increases as rate hikes.""

So rates haven’t increased, but some homeowners and certain low-income individuals are receiving less money to offset their tax bills.

New Jersey scaled back the state’s earned income tax credit -- which the state Treasury Department website says ""reduces the amount of New Jersey tax you owe and may also give you a refund, even if you have no tax liability to New Jersey"" -- in Christie’s first year in office.

Also, Christie cut spending for two property tax relief programs.

Budget analyses from the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services shows homeowners who qualify for one of those programs, what is now called the Homestead Benefit program, received an average rebate of more than $1,000 in fiscal year 2010. Now, the average credit is less than half that amount.  

State Treasury Department officials argued that these tax credit programs are payments from the state and so reductions in credits do not represent tax increases.

Bill Quinn, a Treasury Department spokesman, said  ""the Earned Income Tax Credit in most cases really represents a subsidy payment to low income citizens,"" pointing out that more than 76 percent of earned income tax credit recipients in 2010 owed no New Jersey tax.

But Dennis J. Ventry, Jr., a professor at University of California Davis School of Law, said that a reduction in a tax credit is  ""absolutely a tax increase.""

""Tax credits reduce tax liability for eligible claimants. Thus, cutting, restricting, or repealing a tax credit for an otherwise eligible individual or business would -- absent other changes to the tax system such as a reduction in rates -- result in higher taxes owed,"" Ventry said.

Richard Pomp, a professor of law at the University of Connecticut and state taxation expert said, ""why are we fighting the semantic issues? To someone who has had a benefit cut that is less money they have to spend,"" whether you call it a tax increase or a spending cut.

However, Joseph Henchman, vice president of legal and state projects at the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, said it’d be a mistake to equate reductions in tax credits as tax increases or spending cuts. ""They have elements of both and are strictly neither,"" he said.

Our ruling

Christie said, ""I haven't raised taxes in the time I've been the governor of New Jersey.""

The rates for the state’s three major taxes have not increased during the governor’s tenure.

But Christie reduced funding for several tax credit programs. The governor’s administration argues those tax credits are spending programs, but several experts said reductions in tax credits amount to tax increases.

We rate this claim Half True.

Barack Obama says Mitt Romney condemned coal-fired power plants as killers
","
Mitt Romney came to coal country on Aug. 14, standing before a crowd of miners in eastern Ohio and pledging to fight for their jobs.

You could be forgiven if you thought this was much ado about 3,150 jobs -- the number employed directly by coal operations in Ohio, at least before two mines announced layoffs recently. But Romney’s greater point was about how coal fires so many power plants in Ohio and the region, and how, he says, environmental regulation from President Barack Obama’s administration threatens jobs at those plants, too. This could drive up the cost of electricity for every Ohioan, Romney said.

This debate -- over the cost of electricity, the shift among power plants to natural gas, the environmental and health risks, the role the government should or shouldn’t play -- has been building for years. And after the event, the Obama campaign had a response, saying that Romney’s position on coal has changed substantially since he was governor of Massachusetts.

""Immediately after becoming governor, Romney condemned coal-fired plants, saying they kill people,"" said an Obama campaign news release. 
The claim was similar to one the Obama team made in a radio ad, and Obama reelection aides backed it with specific quotes Romney made in February, 2003, when Romney was the freshly elected governor of Massachusetts. 
The quotes: 
The Obama campaign also highlighted a Romney quote that had no lethal references but was just as strong. It came from a state of Massachusetts news releasein which Romney said:  ""If the choice is between dirty power plants or protecting the health of the people of Massachusetts, there is no choice in my mind. I will always come down on the side of public health.""

Romney made each of these statements during a Feb. 6, 2003, showdown over the future of the controversial, coal-burning Salem Harbor Power Station.

In 2001, Massachusetts passed new rules to reduce power plant emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and mercury, to be phased in over several years. The mercury standard would not be finalized until 2004. Romney supported the rules, as he made clear repeatedly.

Massachusetts singled out its most egregious polluters as the ""Filthy Five"" plants, including Salem Harbor. Public health and environmental scientists at Harvard studied the emissions from two of the plants in 2000 and concluded that Salem Harbor was responsible for 53 deaths, 570 emergency room visits, 14,400 asthma attacks and 99,000 incidents of upper respiratory symptoms -- all per year.

As occurs with similar studies that health authorities cite, local residents and others who wanted to keep the Salem Harbor plant open (for jobs and tax revenue) disputed those figures, saying they resulted from unproven modeling. It turned out that the Harvard scientists had revised their figures in 2002, putting premature deaths from Salem Harbor’s pollution at 30 per year and reducing the number of emergency room visits to 400 and the asthma attacks at 2,000, according to the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald.

But the scientists stood by the broader conclusion -- that emissions from dirty power plants can be deadly.  The Harvard methodology has now been widely replicated and is respected by health scientists, according to several environmental authorities we spoke with. Romney appeared to accept their findings, too. In the above-mentioned news release, the commonwealth of Massachusetts quoted Romney in the third person on the danger factor:

""Romney said that the Salem Harbor plant is responsible for 53 premature deaths, 570 emergency room visits and 14,400 asthma attacks each year. He also pointed out that coal and oil fired plants contribute significantly more air pollution than their gas fired counterparts, exacerbating acid rain and global warming.""

This was in a news release issued by the governor’s aides, not some radical outside instigator. It was issued under the name of Romney, Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey and Romney’s development chief, Douglas Foy.  According to the Boston Globe, Romney hired Foy from the  Conservation Law Foundation, or CLF, a leading environmental advocacy group in Massachusetts.

The spat with Salem Harbor turned into a testy exchange that February day after Salem Harbor’s then-owner, Pacific Gas and Electric, sought an extension until 2006 to comply with Massachusetts’ emissions rules -- and plant supporters showed up to to demand that the governor back off. Romney was adamant that the company comply by 2004. His statements that day show how he felt: ""That plant kills people."" And to those including city officials who argued that this would cost jobs: ""I will not create jobs that kill people.""

Based on some of the quotes, it might appear that Romney was speaking only about that single plant (which a new owner, Dominion, is phasing out, after which a subsequent third owner will build a natural gas plant there). That’s what we thought when we began looking into this. It is also what the Romney campaign told us in email.

So was it accurate for the Obama campaign to imply that Romney’s words characterized his broader attitude toward coal emissions when he was governor?

We kept looking, because people in the environmental community told us it was a valid claim. And the news release under Romney’s name suggested it as well.

Romney spoke of plants, not just a single one, when he pointed out that coal and oil fired plants contribute significantly more air pollution than their gas fired counterparts, exacerbating acid rain and global warming.

Still, to give him the benefit of doubt, what if he really just meant the Salem Harbor plant? Wasn’t that plant particularly egregious when compared with coal-fired plants under attack by federal regulators today?

No, say environmentalists who include authorities from the CLF.

Their claims are supported by U.S. EPA emissions data we verified independently.

""When he said that ‘this plant kills people,’ he was talking about a plant that produced pollution comparable to the emissions of plants in the Midwest,"" said Seth Kaplan, vice president for policy and climate advocacy at the conservation foundation.

Jonathan Peress, an environmental and regulatory attorney who works for the CLF and was recently chairman of the American Bar Association’s air quality committee, added in a separate interview with PolitiFact Ohio that Romney promoted Massachusetts air standards that were almost identical to those the U.S. EPA wants to enforce -- and that Romney now criticizes.

""The levels of emissions that he was talking about were levels that were virtually identical to what the EPA has proposed,"" Kaplan agreed. ""He was steadfastly standing behind emissions reductions that are the same as those currently attacked.""

To see if this was accurate -- that the emissions Romney decried were similar to or even weaker than those under current attack now by the EPA (whose rules Romney now attacks) -- we examined the emissions cuts that Massachusetts wanted and data on the level of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions at Salem Harbor and in the Midwest. The U.S. EPA keeps the information in its extensive Clean Air Markets database.

Nitrogen oxides react with sunlight to create ozone and smog. Sulfur dioxide is tied to particulate matter and is considered particularly dangerous to health, said Jonathan Walke, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund.

The level of both these substances was multiple times lower at Salem Harbor, even when Romney was trying to force the plant to reduce emissions, than at Eastlake in Northeast Ohio and several other Ohio plants we checked. Our comparisons included multiple years, including Salem Harbor in 2003 with Ohio plants in 2011. To compensate for differences in electricity output, number of boilers and hours of operation at different power plants, we checked the data for emissions per megawatt-hour. The pattern held.

""It’s all the same pollution, albeit in higher quantities in Ohio,"" Walke said.

You might ask why we looked at Eastlake. It’s because FirstEnergy Corp. plans to shut down two of that plant’s boilers rather than spend heavily on scrubbers to comply with EPA rules. This is one of several coal-burning plants at the heart of the current jobs-versus-pollution debate, although Romney did not mention it specifically.

It’s important to note that the rules on nitrogen and sulfur are not what is prompting the FirstEnergy shutdowns. New EPA rules on mercury and toxic metals are the cause of planned closures in Eastlake. The tougher limits won’t take effect until 2014. The EPA aims to cut mercury emissions by 79 percent.

But as the Massachusetts governor, Romney supported mercury reductions in his state, too. In 2004, he signed off on a rule aiming to reduce mercury emissions by 95 percent by 2012. With Romney’s name on the letterhead, Massachusetts in May, 2004, issued a lengthy set of justifications for the mercury rule. Among them:

""First, [new research] confirms and extends our understanding of mercury's harmful effects on learning, attention and other critical cognitive skills in children.  Recent studies have found that children exposed to mercury levels may show signs of attention deficit disorder, impaired visual-spatial skills and poor coordination.""

Romney was ""a champion"" of those mercury regulations, said Shanna Cleveland, a staff attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation. ""He was one of the reasons we got them through.""

Time to clean up: Romney was discussing a specific power plant, Salem Harbor, when he said,  ""That plant kills people."" But the public record shows that his comments were part of a broad emissions-cutting program he embraced.

And the power plant that he considered deadly had emissions that were no worse, and in many cases lower, than at Midwest plants that he would now wants left alone, citing the use of affordable and abundant coal.

If one were to have supported the regulations Romney wanted in 2003, it’s fairly safe to assume that ""one would also support such things nationally,"" said Jonathan Levy, an environmental scientist at  Boston University and Harvard and co-author of the now heavily replicated study on the correlation between coal-burning power plants and respiratory health.

The Obama campaign claimed that as governor, Romney condemned coal plants as killers. He spoke at times of a single plant, but at other times made clear that other plants also needed to cut emissions for the sake of public health. This even included new rules for mercury reductions -- the same substance from coal plants that now is prompting closures in Ohio.

The debate over coal involves calculations of costs, the abundance or scarcity of natural resources, health and environmental risks, and attitudes about government regulation. It is not our role to say Romney was right or wrong at one time.

But with additional information from emissions data, interviews and the public record of his governorship,  the Obama campaign claim about Romney’s coal position of nine years ago is nearly as clear as a haze-free day.
