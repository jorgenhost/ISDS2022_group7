Bernard Jackvony says Providence hasn't elected Republican to Council, Assembly in 30 years
","It’s no revelation that Republicans are scarce at the General Assembly, Rhode Island’s most powerful political body. And some say that lack of partisan diversity in the Democrat-dominated legislature is unhealthy for the body politic.   That was a point made by longtime Republican Bernard Jackvony, former state GOP chairman, lieutenant governor and unsuccessful candidate for governor, who was a panelist on the May 31 broadcast of Rhode Island Public Television’s ""A Lively Experiment.""     ""I say to people in Providence who have been complaining for 50 or 60 years, ‘Why don’t you try something different, because your schools aren’t getting better, your neighborhoods aren’t necessarily getting better, job opportunities aren’t getting better.  Why do you vote for the Democrat?’"" Jackvony said.  ""There hasn’t been a Republican in the legislature or the City Council in Providence in over 30 years.""     Is the GOP desert that vast in the capital city, we wanted to know.     We phoned Paul R. Campbell, Providence city archivist, whose desk is perched in the attic at City Hall, and dropped in on Claudia J. Haugen, chairwoman of the Providence Board of Canvassers and Registration, who is on the first floor.     Institutional memory told us that lawyer Malcolm Farmer III was the last Republican on the council, but we were unsure just when he left office. And we thought Jackvony might be in for a surprise regarding the legislature.     Haugen reported there are 100,253 active registered voters, of which 60,627, or 60 percent, are Democrats. The rest are: 34,402 unaffiliated, or 34.3 percent; 4,950 Republican, or 4.94 percent; and 274 Moderate Party, or .76 percent.     Until the 1980s the Republicans were influential on the affluent East Side, especially in Ward 2.   But the East Side, too, has turned deep blue.   We asked Campbell to identify the last Republican council member. He assigned archival assistant Caleb Horton to take what he said would be the quickest research route: poring over, ahem, old Providence Journal-Bulletin Almanacs, where the certified results of elections were published.     For the last Republican General Assembly member from Providence, we turned to state librarian Thomas R. Evans, who consulted lists published by the Joint Committee on Legislative Services.     Their answers: Farmer served from 1979 through 1990, when he opted not to seek reelection, representing Ward 2 as the last Republican on the council -- 22½ years ago. And Mary C. Ross represented the old House District 17, in the West End, for one term in 1993-94 -- 19½ years ago. Both were considerably more recent than Jackvony’s remark that it has been ""over 30 years.""     ""As they say in the State House, close enough for government work,"" Jackvony quipped, when we called him with the results of our research. He attributed the Republican eclipse in Providence to demographic and social changes similar to those that have occurred in many urban areas.     Jackvony, in his statement on ""A Lively Experiment,"" was making the point that it has been a long time since a Republican sat on the council or represented the city in the Assembly.     While he said over 30 years, it’s in fact 19½. His overall point may have been sound, but his numbers weren’t. The judges rule Mostly False.",[],/factchecks/2013/jun/14/bernard-jackvony/bernard-jackvony-says-providence-has-not-elected-r/

How well has Pink Pony behaved?
","
There are a few places you’d expect to follow the letter of the law. A house of worship, a school, a strip club. 
A strip club? 
Sure, say the owners and legal representatives of the Pink Pony club. 
The club’s lawyers have made such claims in recent weeks amid a legal dispute with the city of Brookhaven. 
In May, the Pink Pony ownership filed a lawsuit against the DeKalb County municipality claiming Brookhaven’s ordinance to regulate sexually oriented businesses would put the club out of business. Specifically, the ordinance would prohibit nude dancing, with or without serving alcohol. The city announced Thursday afternoon it would not enforce the ordinance until a DeKalb County Superior Court judge ruled on its legality. 
""Throughout the approximately twenty-two years of operation, Pink Pony has never been cited for any violation of any ordinance or state law,"" Pink Pony attorneys wrote in their complaint against the city. 
Alan Begner, the ponytailed Pink Pony attorney who’s for years represented adult entertainment establishments against local governments, made similar comments in a television interview. 
""The Pink Pony has been operating 22 years and has never been cited for a violation of any law or ordinance,"" Begner told WXIA-TV. 
So is their claim risqué? PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d take this claim for a ride on the Truth-O-Meter. Has the Pink Pony ownership ever been cited for a violation of any state or local ordinance? What we found surprised us. 
In 1991, the Pink Pony opened for business just off Buford Highway near the heavily traveled corridor of I-85 and Druid Hills Road. Over the years, it’s become a bucket list item on any tour of offbeat metro Atlanta. Some rock stars hang out there after doing a show in Atlanta. A Tiger Woods paramour used part of her 15 minutes of fame performing at the Pink Pony. 
The Pink Pony has had its issues. In 1994, a man sued the club saying a nude dancer bit him on the face after he placed a tip in her garter belt. There are the occasional bouncer throws disorderly patron stories. 
Then, there was the controversial 1997 Miss Nude World International pageant. Competitor Vanessa Steele Inman said she lost because she refused to allow one of the contest coordinators to lick whipped cream off her body in a photo shoot. Her evidence that the fix was in: ballots from the Pink Pony's dumpster, which showed she had the highest score among the contestants. 
A jury awarded Steele $2.4 million in damages. In 2008, the Georgia Court of Appeals reversed the decision, leaving the exotic dancer with just $3,500 for attorney's fees, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. 
But Pink Pony owners have never been cited for any violations of a local or state ordinance, they say. 
""I don’t know if someone was arrested in a fight, but we were not arrested,"" Begner said in a telephone interview. 
Since the club opened in 1991, any law enforcement matter or issue with government involving the Pink Pony would be handled by DeKalb County. On Dec. 17, 2012, the club fell under the authority of the newly incorporated city of Brookhaven. Since the Pink Pony was under the local jurisdiction of DeKalb County for more than two decades, we contacted several agencies there to see if they could expose any violations by the club’s owners. 
We reached out to the DeKalb County district attorney’s office to see if it had any records of violations by the Pink Pony. Spokesman Erik Burton said they could not find any such records. 
PolitiFact Georgia contacted DeKalb County government, wondering if Pink Pony management had been cited for any code violations. The county’s code compliance staff reported no violations, DeKalb’s chief of public affairs, Jill Strickland, told us. 
We also contacted the DeKalb County Police Department. Maybe the vice squad or another division within the department conducted an operation that found evidence of wrongdoing by management. 
""After reviewing your request it has been determined that the DeKalb County Police Department does not have any documents that are responsive to your request,"" they wrote in a June 10 letter. 
PolitiFact Georgia also checked with some state agencies to see if they had anything that may dispute what the Pink Pony claimed. 
The Georgia secretary of state’s office had no records of any infractions and said the corporate renewal of Trop Inc. had not lapsed. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation looked under the Pink Pony, Trop Inc. and owner Dennis Williams and could not find anything related to the DeKalb County business. 
Again, we were focused on examining the claim that the club ownership -- not individual dancers or staff -- has not violated any laws or ordinances. 
Nothing to see here, it seems. No agency could find any record of a violation. 
We rate this statement True.","[('\nPetition by Trop Inc. and the JEG Family Trust vs the city of Brookhaven, filed May 13, 2013.', 'https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/711469-pink-pony-lawsuit.html'), ('\nWXIA-TV, ""Pink Pony strip club sues Brookhaven,"" May 29, 2013.', 'No link'), ('\nEmail from DeKalb County district attorney spokesman Erik Burton, June 4, 2013.', 'http://www.11alive.com/news/article/294433/40/Pink-Pony-strip-club-sues-Brookhaven'), ('\nEmail from DeKalb County government chief of public affairs Jill Strickland, June 5, 2013.', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2013/jun/14/pink-pony/how-well-has-pink-pony-behaved/

Rep. Mike Rogers says 'it's expressly prohibited by law' for the government to read domestic email traffic
","
So, is the NSA reading your email? 
News reports from the Guardian and the Washington Post in June raised questions about just what data the National Security Agency collects about Americans, and how it’s used. 
Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., who chairs the House committee that oversees intelligence agencies, argues the data-collection programs are effective and operate under strict limits. 
""The National Security Agency does not listen to Americans' phone calls and it is not reading Americans' emails. None of these programs allow that,"" he told host George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s Sunday talk show This Week. ""As a matter of fact, the Patriot Act, part of that, 702, says it's expressly prohibited by law that you can read and wholly surveil domestic email traffic in the United States."" 
With new, leaked information swirling about broad data collection under secret court orders, we wondered: Does the law expressly prohibit the government from reading and engaging in surveillance of Americans’ domestic email? 
The news 
Rogers was responding to discussion prompted by leaks from Edward Snowden, a 29-year-old former NSA contractor who left his job in Hawaii for Hong Kong. 
Rogers mentioned both phone calls and emails. While we’re focusing on his claim about American email, it’s helpful to understand that Snowden’s leaks revealed details about two separate programs that function under different areas of the law. 
First, a June 5 story in the Guardian by Glenn Greenwald disclosed a secret court order requiring Verizon to turn over ""all call detail records"" on an ""ongoing daily basis,"" such as phone numbers and length of calls — but not their content. 
Second, stories published June 6 by the Washington Post and the Guardian revealed top-secret PowerPoint slides that describe a data-collection program code-named Prism. The slides, dated April 2013, outline a program to collect email, chats, videos, photos, stored data and files from nine technology and social media companies, including Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, Facebook and Apple. 
The programs are authorized under different — but related — pieces of legislation, both tied in some way to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, or FISA. 
The phone-records order relies on U.S. Code amended by Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which updated provisions of FISA. By contrast, the Prism program falls under FISA’s Section 702, according to a response to news articles from the director of national intelligence, a part of the law added in 2008. 
Rogers had mentioned both the ""Patriot Act"" and ""702."" We asked Rogers’ office what part of the law he was talking about when he said it’s ""expressly prohibited"" to ""read and wholly surveil domestic email traffic in the United States."" 
The communications director for the House intelligence committee clarified he was talking about FISA’s Section 702. (The section was added by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, renewed under President Barack Obama in December 2012, so Rogers misspoke when he mentioned the Patriot Act.) 
Section 702 allows the attorney general and the director of national intelligence to authorize targeting of people ""reasonably believed to be outside the United States"" for ""foreign intelligence information."" 
Under the section’s provisions, the government isn’t allowed to ""intentionally target"" citizens or people inside the United States, or to target someone outside the country for the purpose of getting information about a specific person who’s in the U.S. 
Committee spokeswoman Susan Phalen highlighted, in particular, the requirement that the government ""may not intentionally acquire any communication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of the acquisition to be located in the United States."" 
But while Rogers was right that under Section 702, the government can't ""wholly surveil domestic email traffic in the United States,"" his statement didn't tell the whole story, said several experts, including analysts for activist groups concerned about privacy. 
They say that in the process of gathering information about foreigners, the government might be sweeping up vast amounts of American email. As long it’s not gathered for the purpose of targeting a ""particular, known person"" in the United States, that would appear to be acceptable under the law. Meanwhile, American email might be read with authorization under different parts of FISA. 
""The government is expressly prohibited from intentionally targeting any person known at the time of the surveillance to be located in the United States,"" said Molly Bishop Shadel, a University of Virginia law professor who once worked for the Justice Department representing the United States on terrorism-related matters before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. ""But that doesn't mean the government can never surveil people in the U.S.; it just means they can't do it under Section 702."" 
Officials could instead get permission to read emails under other parts of FISA, which require showing that a person is an agent of a foreign power. 
Meanwhile, experts note that the government might be collecting vast amounts of Internet traffic that happens to include data from Americans. 
""It's illegal to target domestic email traffic, but nothing at all stops the government from intercepting emails between U.S. persons as long as it's an ‘incidental’ byproduct of surveillance that is specifically authorized under Section 702,"" said Steve Vladeck, an American University law professor. ""So if the government targets an email server in British Columbia that happens to have a lot of Seattle-based email traffic, odds are pretty good they'll pick up a bunch of ‘domestic’ emails. Then the question becomes what they do with them."" 
The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 that included Section 702 made that kind of incidental pickup of American email more likely, experts told us. Before that legislation, the government needed to seek a warrant to surveil a specific person. But under the law now, ""they can target groups of people,"" said Trevor Timm, a digital rights analyst for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. 
""It's really unclear about the scope of how much Internet traffic they are sucking up,"" he said. ""By targeting those foreigners, they are naturally vacuuming up Americans' emails."" 
Our ruling 
Rogers suggested Americans are protected against NSA eyeballs on their email, claiming, ""It's expressly prohibited by law that you can read and wholly surveil domestic e-mail traffic in the United States."" He’s right that surveillance authorized under Section 702 of FISA prohibits targeting Americans or intentionally collecting domestic email. But it doesn’t explicitly protect against gathering up records as a byproduct of foreign surveillance. The government can also seek authorization for surveilling an American’s email if it can show that person is an agent of a foreign power. Rogers’ claim is accurate, but it needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.","[('\nCQ Newsmaker Transcripts, ""George Stephanopoulos Hosts ABC\'s ‘This Week,’"" June 9, 2013', 'http://cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4291558'), ('\nEmail interview with Susan Phalen, communications director, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, June 11, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nNPR, ""He Broke The NSA Leaks Story, But Just Who Is Glenn Greenwald?""

Mark Udall says ordinary Americans' business records caught up in surveillance net
","
While most Americans seem ready to support intelligence agencies casting a wide net against terrorists, they have some concerns about the scope of domestic surveillance. Congress began hearings on the surveillance of phone calls and Internet traffic that became public last week. 
On June 9, 2013, ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos aired footage of comments from Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo. In a floor speech roughly two years ago, Udall urged his colleagues to narrow the reach of the USA Patriot Act, one of the key legal tools that allow the United States to gather intelligence. 
Udall had been briefed on the program that stored data on millions of phone calls made in the United States, but secrecy rules prohibited him from offering details. Instead, he warned broadly that the intelligence community ""can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism."" 
Udall’s office affirmed that they still reflect the senator’s position. So we wondered whether the law allows the intelligence community to legally ""collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism."" 
Udall cited Section 215 of the Patriot Act as the relevant part of the law. This provision was reportedly the one used by the government to obtain a broad sweep of ""metadata"" -- information on phone numbers, call durations and other information short of the actual conversations -- from Verizon customers. 
Section 215 allows the FBI to require ""the production of any tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents, and other items) for an investigation to protect against international terrorism."" 
However, the government faces some limits. The FBI must demonstrate to a special court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the tangible things being sought are relevant to an investigation involving terrorism. Approval must be renewed every three months. The law also requires steps to limit access to information beyond the scope of the investigation. 
After the Guardian published its article on the gathering of millions of phone records from Verizon customers, the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, addressed the ""business records"" provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
Clapper said the ""program does not allow the government to listen in on anyone’s phone calls. The information acquired does not include the content of any communications or the identity of any subscriber. The only type of information acquired under the court’s order is telephony metadata, such as telephone numbers dialed and length of calls,"" Clapper said in a written statement. 
Gen. Keith Alexander, the head of the National Security Agency, acknowledged in a Senate hearing on June 12 that the NSA has collected millions of records under section 215. 
In short, the program that obtained the data on Verizon customers was deemed legal by the FISA court, and it produced what the government considered ""business records"" -- specifically, metadata. Information on millions of Americans was accessed, almost all of whom had no connection to terrorism. 
Udall’s claim appears accurate. Congress wrote the law and key lawmakers were kept apprised of the program; the FISA court approved it, apparently on multiple occasions. 
Former Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, an Intelligence Committee chairman until 2005, said the ongoing activity speaks to the soundness of its legal footing. 
""It is being done,"" Graham said. ""Given the fact that it has not been successfully challenged in the courts, that would suggest that it is within the agency’s authority to do so."" 
Steve Vladeck, professor of law at the American University Washington College of Law, concurred that the law seems to be on the government’s side. 
""Section 215 of the Patriot Act only requires that the data be ‘relevant’ to a national security/terrorism investigation, not that the individual whose data is seized have such a connection,"" Vladeck said. 
Still, we’ll point out a few things. 
First, just because the government is doing it and a court is approving it doesn’t mean that the metadata-collection program will be upheld as constitutional indefinitely. The American Civil Liberties Union has already begun to challenge the program, for instance. 
And the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a group focused on the intersection of technology and personal liberties, charged in a letter to Congress that the FISA court had overstepped its authority. The group said the government had failed to provide ""reasonable grounds"" for the collection of millions of Verizon telephone records. 
Second, there’s a distinction between collecting data and sifting through it. While the government has been storing phone call information in a giant database, it cannot legally access that information willy-nilly. Before it can drill down into actual phone calls, it has to meet a higher legal standard: The government must convince the court that it has a clear and reasonable suspicion that the calls are relevant to terrorist activity. Supporters of the program including the White House and lawmakers cite the need to get specific permission for database queries as an essential protection of individual privacy. 
Our ruling 
Udall said that currently, the intelligence community ""can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism."" 
Recent news reports, which prompted acknowledgements by U.S. officials, confirm that intelligence agencies have been gathering a vast amount of phone metadata, which they argue falls under the category of business records. This metadata can be ""collected"" -- as Udall phrased it -- though it’s important to note that this data cannot be utilized directly in an investigation until a more stringent legal standard is met. 
Meanwhile, common sense tells us that millions of Americans who are having their metadata collected are not involved in terrorism, further bolstering Udall’s claim. 
Because this program was approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, it is, in a de facto sense, legal.

"['Pensions', 'Texas', 'Doug Miller']","
Legislator says less than half of 1 percent of Texas legislators ever drew a benefit from pension tied to the salary of a state district judge
","
State Rep. Doug Miller declared that very few legislators, who are paid $7,200 a year plus expenses, have qualified to draw pension benefits based on the much greater salary of a state district judge. 
During Texas House debate May 21, 2013, the New Braunfels Republican pointed out that a legislator has to serve eight years to qualify for the pension if he or she retires at age 60, or 10 years ""if you retired at age 50."" (Actually, a legislator needs to serve 12 years to retire with the benefits at age 50, according to a booklet from the Employees Retirement System of Texas.) 
Miller further declared that it takes 43 years and six months of service to qualify for 100 percent of the pension, which is equal to the salary of a state district judge. For each year of service, a legislator qualifies for a pension equal to 2.3 percent of the judicial salary, which has been $125,000 since 2005, Austin American-Statesman commentator Ken Herman reported in a column posted online May 30, 2013. 
Miller wasn’t done. After noting the average tenures of current lawmakers, he said, ""Less than half a percent of the people that ever served, and there have been over 5,000 people (who) served in this House, less than half a percent ever receive a benefit under this (pension) plan."" 
We took that as Miller saying that less than half of 1 percent of House and Texas Senate members ever drew a pension benefit, an interpretation Miller confirmed by telephone. 
Is that right? 
To our request for backup information, Miller’s office sent us a document indicating that 63 of the 181 current members of the House and Senate, 35 percent, will have served 10 years or more through 2013. This was accompanied by a 27-page document, dated May 21, 2013, and attributed to the Legislative Reference Library, listing legislators since statehood who have served 10 years or more. 
According to news accounts, lawmakers tied legislator pensions to the salary of a state district judge in 1975. By telephone, Mary Jane Wardlow, a spokeswoman for the Employees Retirement System of Texas, said that a 1969 law previously allowed legislators to contribute a portion of their pay check to the retirement system, which would potentially have qualified them for pensions tied to their own salaries. 
Unsaid: The 1975 law set in motion better long-term rewards. 
And according to a May 17, 2013, Texas Tribune news article, lawmakers this year were poised to increase the base salary of state district judges by 12 percent, to $140,000, which would increase the legislative pension benefit by at least $2,760 a year. 
""Actual benefits vary depending on choices lawmakers make in their plans (they can opt out, though few do so), on other pensions, and non-legislative government service and so on,"" the story said, with eligible members qualifying for annual pensions of $27,760 to $140,000. The story said that former House Speaker Tom Craddick, a House member since the late 1960s, would be subject to a cap of $140,000 ""since the benefit can't exceed the amount of the judicial salary it's based on."" Also, the story said, retired lawmakers would draw the increases in pension payments, too. ""The retired elected officials class currently includes 513 former legislators, district attorneys and others,"" the Tribune said, ""as well as 137 survivor beneficiaries, each of whom collects an average of $44,196 in annual benefits."" 
Miller did not specify how he determined the number of legislators who have drawn a benefit from the pension. But by email, his chief of staff, Fritz Reinig, pointed out the reference library’s online database listing every legislator since 1846. Texas joined the United States in late 1845. 
Working from the library’s lists, we estimated the number of legislators who at least became eligible for the pension, conservatively sticking with Miller's formulation tied to 10 years of service rather than the minimum of 8 years needed to qualify. By our count, about 380 legislators served 10 years or more from 1969 through the 2013 regular session. Over those years, reference librarian Catherine Wusterhausen told us by email, 971 individuals served as legislators. Put another way, then, approximately 39 percent of legislators would have qualified for the pension benefit, though this is not to say that each one signed up for it; that’s not public information, Wardlow said. 
Yet Miller’s claim referred to all legislators since statehood. Our search of the library’s database for every legislator since 1846 delivered 5,515 names, which was probably too high. Wusterhausen told us by email that, like her 971 count, this figure would include temporary acting representatives and those later removed following an election contest plus individuals elected but not sworn in. 
Conservatively speaking, still, our estimated 380 legislators who could have qualified for the pension comprise 7 percent of all Texas legislators through history. 
What gives? 
Miller, apprised of our analysis, said his intent was to show that few legislators serve long enough to qualify for the potential pensions. From his list, for instance, it appears that nine of the House’s 150 members will have served 21 years or more through 2013. That's how long a member would have to serve to potentially draw a pension equal to half a district judge’s salary. 
Miller agreed his ""half of 1 percent"" claim did not come out as intended. ""It’s the heat of the debate,"" he said. 
Our ruling 
Miller said that ""less than half of 1 percent"" of Texas legislators through history have drawn a benefit from the pension tied to the salary of a state district judge. 
Granted, the state cannot reveal which legislators have qualified or chosen to take the pension. But by our reckoning based on legislative rosters, more than 7 percent of legislators through history could have qualified for the pension benefit. That’s misleading in itself, though, because only about 1,000 legislators have served since the benefit was put into law. We estimate that 39 percent of actual potential beneficiaries have served 10 years or more, meaning they could have qualified for the pension. 
Either percentage is considerably more than ""less than half of 1 percent,"" leaving this claim as False.","[('\nTelephone interviews, Doug Miller, New Braunfels, June 5 and 12, 2013', 'https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0kkOiAWUCUGbkhpM3RCeE1kWmM/edit?usp=sharing'), ('\nBooklet, ""Retirement Benefits for Elected State Officials,"" Employees Retirement System of Texas, January 2013 (downloaded June 7, 2013)', 'No link'), ('\nDocuments, Texas House and Senate members, years as legislators and Legislators who served 10 years or more, 1846 to present, (received by email from Fritz Reinig, chief of staff to Rep.

"['New Jersey', 'Congress', 'History', 'Christine Whitman']","
Christine Todd Whitman claims Clifford Case was state's last Republican senator
","
New Jersey could be poised to make political history twice in four months. 
The first historic moment came last week when Gov. Chris Christie appointed state attorney general Jeffrey Chiesa to serve as an interim senator after Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg died June 3. Chiesa is a Republican – a political party that hasn’t represented New Jersey in the U.S. Senate in nearly two generations. 
In the meantime, Christie has scheduled a special primary for Aug. 13. Four Democrats and two Republicans have filed to run in the primary. A special general election is scheduled Oct. 16, when history could be made again if voters send a Republican to the Senate. 
The historic possibility wasn’t lost on former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who discussed it June 4 during an interview on the John Gambling radio show. 
""We haven't had a Republican senator in Washington for ... why, I think Clifford Case was our last Republican senator,"" Whitman said. 
Whitman’s claim is on target, but she’s not quite correct. 
Let’s review some history. 
Democrats have held both of the state’s Senate seats for more than three decades, PolitiFact New Jersey determined earlier this year after Christie claimed during a speech at the libertarian Cato Institute that the state was coming up on the 40th anniversary of the last time voters elected a Republican – Case -- to the Senate. 
Case started his fourth six-year term in the Senate in 1972 and lost a bid for re-election in the 1978 GOP primary to Jeffrey Bell. 
Bill Bradley, a Democrat, defeated Bell in the 1978 general election, starting the Democratic dominance of New Jersey’s two Senate seats. 
But Case wasn’t the last Republican to represent New Jersey in the Senate. That distinction goes to Republican Nicholas Brady, who was appointed to a Senate seat in April 1982. Then-Gov. Tom Kean appointed Brady to fill in for Democrat Harrison Williams Jr., who was forced to give up his Senate seat after bribery and conspiracy convictions stemming from a federal corruption probe called ABSCAM. 
So Case was the last Republican senator actually elected by New Jerseyans to the Senate, but Brady was the most recent Republican to serve the Garden State in the Senate prior to Chiesa’s appointment. We make that distinction because Whitman didn’t. 
Brady, who would go on to serve as U.S. Treasury secretary in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, stepped down in December 1982 after Lautenberg won that year’s general election for the Senate, defeating Republican Millicent Fenwick. Kean appointed Lautenberg to complete the final days of the term. 
Lautenberg started his first full term in January 1983 and served three six-year terms before retiring. He returned to the Senate two years later and served until his death. 
In addition to Chiesa, who said he will not run in the special election, Democrat Robert Menendez also represents New Jersey in the Senate. He was re-elected in November. 
Whitman spokesperson Heather Grizzle said the former governor declined comment. 
Our ruling 
Whitman said during a radio interview, ""We haven't had a Republican senator in Washington for ... why, I think Clifford Case was our last Republican senator."" 
Brady was the last Republican to serve in the Senate, for eight months in 1982, prior to Chiesa’s appointment. Before that, Case was the last Republican that New Jersey voters elected to the Senate. 
Since Whitman referred to the ‘last’ Republican senator to represent New Jersey, that title goes to Brady. We therefore rate the former governor’s claim Mostly True.

Did 1913 Revenue Act prohibit political organizations from claiming tax exempt status?
","
Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., finds himself in the crosshairs of the web-o-sphere after he condemned political organizations ""parading"" as social welfare groups, which don’t have to disclose donors. 
Here’s what the congressman said at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing into allegations that the Internal Revenue Service targeted conservative groups for scrutiny, including the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage. We offer the relevant portion it in its entirety. 
""It's everybody's right to participate in politics, and well you should. But I think having organizations parading as being social welfare organizations and then being involved in the political combat harkens back to why the statute a hundred years ago said that they were prohibited and why I wholeheartedly agree with my colleague, Mr. Doggett, saying that we ought to stop this regulation interpretation from 1959 that invites people to raise vast sums of money and keep it secret and to engage in political activity -- and some of it, I think, not necessarily promoting the social welfare of our country."" (our emphasis) 
Our question was a simple one: Was there a tax statute 100 years ago that specifically prohibited political groups from claiming tax exempt status under a social welfare provision? 
We checked with the Internal Revenue Service, thinking this was a pretty straightforward question. Alas, the spokesman was of no help. 
""I must decline to comment since an IRS opinion would appear to be a statement on the accuracy (of) what the Member of Congress said. The language of the 1913 act can be researched,"" wrote Richard Panick, in an email to PolitiFact Oregon. 
So away we went. Thanks, federal government. (Not.) 
We learned that in 1862, President Lincoln approved a revenue-raising measure to help pay for Civil War expenses, creating the office of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. In 1913, states ratified the Sixteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, giving Congress the ability to levy and collect income taxes. 
The Revenue Act of 1913, also called the Underwood Tariff Act, established what we consider the modern income tax system. Much of it dealt with lowering tariffs on goods. It included a tax exemption for organizations devoted to social welfare, the precursor to today’s Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(4). (And the Form 1040 was born.) 
The language of Section II, G(a)states that the tax shall not apply to: 
""labor, agricultural, or horticultural organizations, or to mutual savings banks ... nor to cemetery companies, organized and operated exclusively for the mutual benefit of their members, nor to any corporation or association organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, or educational purposes … nor to business leagues, nor to chambers of commerce or boards of trade, not organized for profit or no part of the net income of which inures to the benefit of the private stockholder or individual; nor to any civic league or organization not organized for profit, but operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare:"" (our emphasis) 
We’re truncating here, but you get the picture: Groups dedicated to civic benevolence did not have to pay federal tax, so long as private individuals did not profit. There is no mention of political activity, whether it’s prohibited or not. There is little explanation for why this exemption existed. 
Patrick Malone, spokesman for Rep. Blumenauer, said that the 1913 Act placed a prohibition on political organizations by not including such activity as being eligible for exemption as social welfare. 
""We think it is extremely accurate to say that there is a distinction between social welfare groups and political groups, since the former is included and the latter is not, and to say that there is clearly no exemption for political groups,"" Malone wrote in an email to PolitiFact Oregon. 
But is not including the same as prohibiting? 
We turned to Richard Schmalbeck, a law professor at Duke University and an expert on nonprofit tax issues. He understands what Blumenauer is getting at -- groups that engage in political activity should claim tax exemption under another part of the tax code rather than hide out under ""social welfare"" -- but figuring out legislative intent from 100 years ago isn’t so clear-cut. 
""I can’t entirely endorse what he’s said, because we just don’t know,"" Schmalbeck said. ""They didn’t bother to explain. They just didn’t have staff to do it, and it wasn’t the habit."" 
Roberta Mann, a law professor at the University of Oregon, agreed with Schmalbeck that the law was silent on the issue, but clarified that the law implicitly prohibited political activity. 
""The tax-exempt rules were developed when election laws prohibited corporations (including tax-exempt corporations) from using their funds for political contributions,"" she wrote in an email. 
In any case, the Treasury Department  has since tweaked the definition to say that ""an organization is operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare if it is primarily engaged in promoting in some way the common good and general welfare of the people of the community."" (our emphasis) 
Specifically, the Treasury interpreted the code so that political activity did not count as ""social welfare"" but also did not disqualify a group from claiming a social welfare exemption. In other words, political activity must not be the group’s primary activity. 
We went back to Malone. He said two things signal to him that political groups are prohibited. One, Congress meant the list to be inclusive, because they were so detailed in the organizations included. Two, had Congress meant to include other unlisted activities, they could have used the phrase ""include, but are not limited to."" 
Congress has moved in recent years toward separating political activity from social welfare activity. Political groups and parties can claim tax-exempt status under the 527 section of the tax code. Since 2000, parties and political organizations have had to register as such, and disclose donors, Schmalbeck said. 
Of course, there are political groups on both the right and the left that probably should be categorized as a 527 but claim 501(c)(4) status. Why? ""Social welfare"" groups do not have to disclose donors -- a bonus for people keen to keep their political work private. 
PolitiFact Oregon is impressed by the lawyerly analysis from Blumenauer’s office. However, we have two professors who say the law is silent on political activity -- even if one of them sees an implicit prohibition -- and a plain reading of the law that states no explicit ban. 
Blumenauer said that ""the statute a hundred years ago said that they were prohibited.""  There was no prohibition in the 1913 Act. The 1913 Act was silent on political activity, for whatever reasons.

Rick Perry says law requires state agencies to give preference to goods produced and grown in Texas when purchasing goods
","
In vetoing House Bill 535, a measure dealing with how state agencies select and buy goods, Gov. Rick Perry said, ""Current law already requires state agencies to give preference to goods produced and grown in Texas."" 
Perry said in a press release May 25, 2013, the day of the veto, that ""HB 535 requires state agencies, when purchasing goods, to give preference to goods ‘manufactured’ in Texas. … This bill simply does not change current law."" 
Soon after, a reader emailed us to ask: ""Is this truly in current law""? 
The law that the bill would have modified is in Section 2155.444 of the state's Government Code, which says that when ""making purchases of goods, including agricultural products,"" the comptroller and state agencies ""shall give preference to those produced or grown in this state or offered by Texas bidders."" Next, the law says, goods from elsewhere in the United States must be considered. 
State law has contained Texas-first purchasing preferences for more than 50 years. According to a May 4, 1981, state attorney general opinion, the Legislature created ""Texas preferences"" with a 1957 law which replaced an older statute favoring ""bidders who have an established local business."" The 1957 law, according to the opinion, ""created a preference for products produced in Texas as well as one for products offered by Texas citizens."" 
HB 535, as filed Jan. 15, 2013, by Rep. Yvonne Davis, D-Dallas, added ""manufactured"" to ""produced or grown"" and included a definition: ""‘Manufactured’ means, with respect to assembled goods, the final assembly, processing, packaging, testing, or other process that adds value, quality, or reliability."" It added a requirement that the state comptroller shall ""promote the purchase of"" such Texas-grown or otherwise Texas-created goods. 
In the legislation’s final version, that definition encompassed items ""produced as a result of a manufacturing process that alters the form or function of components"" in a way that adds value and transforms the parts into something different from what simply assembling the parts would have produced. 
Both versions also added a requirement that the state comptroller and state agencies ""promote the purchase of"" Texas goods. 
Ed Sills, spokesman for the Texas AFL-CIO labor federation, which supported the vetoed proposal, told us by phone that the combined effect of requiring such promotion, emphasizing manufactured goods and encouraging agencies to ""buy Texan, buy American"" could have been powerful. ""Current law does have preferences. It doesn’t have as robust a preference as it would have if this bill had passed,"" Sills said. 
A spokesman for the state comptroller’s office -- which counsels state agencies on purchasing -- said by email that the state interprets the current law to cover goods manufactured in Texas. R.J. DeSilva said, ""Texas agencies have always considered the term ‘produced’ to include manufactured goods. Therefore, the preference for manufactured goods was already being provided."" 
DeSilva sent us a link to comptroller procurement rules in the Texas Administrative Code stating, ""Supplies, materials, and equipment are considered to be produced in Texas if they are manufactured in Texas; ‘manufactured’ does not include the work of packaging or repackaging."" 
Our ruling 
Perry said, ""Current law already requires state agencies to give preference to goods produced and grown in Texas."" 
That holds up. Existing law says that when making purchases of goods, the comptroller and state agencies ""shall give preference to those produced or grown in this state or offered by Texas bidders."" And the comptroller operates under rules that say items ""manufactured"" in Texas are considered to be ""produced"" in Texas.

Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty says law aims to discourage contributions to groups Soglin disagrees with
","
Madison Mayor Paul Soglin wants to require city contractors to publicly disclose donations they’ve made to super PACS or advocacy groups operating in Wisconsin. 
That has drawn objections from a conservative public interest law firm, the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty. It contends the liberal mayor’s proposed ordinance is unconstitutional and violates ""a bedrock principle of our democracy that government cannot play favorites among citizens, including public contractors, based on their political beliefs."" 
So why does Soglin want to mandate the public disclosures by firms doing business with the city? 
Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty offered this answer in a June 4, 2012 post on its website: The proposed ordinance, ""according to Mayor Soglin, is intended to discourage contributions to organizations with which he disagrees."" 
Is that what Soglin has said is a goal of the legislation? 
Asked to back up the group’s claim, Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty president and general counsel Rick Esenberg pointed to a May 8, 2013 story in Madison’s Capital Times that quoted Soglin extensively about his motives. 
The article stated that actions by Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature that ran contrary to the wishes of Madison and Soglin were on the mayor’s mind  when he drafted the ordinance. 
""Legislative action since Gov. Scott Walker’s election — including Act 10 in 2011 curtailing the collective bargaining power of most public workers, and more recently, legislation setting levy limits for municipalities and restricting cities’ powers in tenant-landlord law — got Soglin wondering if companies supporting Republican causes would rather lobby against the city or do business with it,"" the Cap Times story said. 
It added: ""He’s betting that exposing such activities might prompt some companies to curtail them."" 
Those passages suggest pretty strongly that Soglin believes that some contractors faced with being identified as pro-Republican or pro-conservative will reconsider their political activity under his proposal to require them to publicly report their now-private donations to advocacy groups. 
Deeper into the Capital Times interview, Soglin made another reference to the right side of the political spectrum. 
He mentioned the Koch Brothers, the billionaire industrialists who founded the conservative group Americans for Prosperity, a tea-party organization that supported Walker in his 2012 recall win. It’s unclear how much the group raises and spends because as a tax-exempt organization the group, like many others, does not have to disclose its donors. 
Soglin’s additional comments from the article: 
""I think it would be a good idea to know if the bidders are contributing to political efforts which go into organizations that may be lobbying for certain kinds of outcomes or working against the interests of the city. It is simply the idea that sunshine is good."" 
""If a company bidding on a city contract also is lobbying for state or federal regulations that make their product required in their industry, the public ought to know about it. At the same time if they’re supplying the city while they're behaving like the Koch brothers, it would be good for the public to know it."" 
""It’s a bit ironic when someone wants a contract with government, yet supports organizations that hate government and try to make it inefficient."" 
So that is what is in the article. 
To be sure, the language of the proposed ordinance itself doesn’t say Soglin’s intent is to squelch donations. 
It says information on donations is ""essential to the operation of a democracy, informing voters and governments about the activities of those attempting to influence the operations of government."" 
Indeed, the proposal would require disclosure of donations to groups of any political stripe -- it does not single out conservatives or Republicans. Rather, the ordinance specifies that firms and minority owners disclose donations made to tax-exempt 501(c)(4) advocacy or ""super PAC"" organizations operating in Wisconsin the prior two years. 
Contractors would face a one-year ban from receiving city contracts if they fail to disclose any donations to advocacy groups within 30 days of getting a contract. 
When we reached Soglin, he acknowledged the ordinance might cause some firms hoping to continue as city contractors to stop making donations to groups that oppose the views of he and other city leaders. 
""I will not say that this will leave things exactly the way things are,"" he said. 
But Soglin added this: 
He said the contractors were free to exercise their First Amendment rights and that he hopes they continue to make such donations, saying, ""I want to know where they stand."" 
He said his goal was to unmask donations, for example, by firms whose ownersmake private donations to advocacy groups working to unseat sitting aldermen. Or to identify firm officials who give to groups supporting private-school vouchers and other programs and decisions he and city officials have opposed. 
""I think the public has a right to know,"" said Soglin. 
What would happen if left-leaning city officials discover that contractors are fighting the views of city officials in private? 
Soglin said no city officials will take into account political donations when officials are deciding on awarding a contract. That language is also included in the ordinance. 
But Scott Resnick, the Madison Common Council’s president pro tem, told us in an interview that aldermen would, in fact, use the information on donations made to groups supporting Republicans in state government when evaluating whether firms should be rewarded future city contracts. 
""So we want to know if you were putting money towards that before we sign another contract with you,"" he said. ""This would be one more data set that will be used to make decisions"" on awarding contracts. 
In the view of Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty’s Esenberg, the ordinance’s statement that political activity would not be held against firms at contract time shows the provision has no legitimate government purpose. 
""Curiosity is not a valid governmental purpose, nor is the exposure of private contributions to the public for use by you or others in the political arena,"" Esenberg wrote to Soglin on June 3, 2013. 
Soglin, Esenberg said, leaves the listener no other choice but to think that he favors an outcome in which contractors curtail their political activity. 
""He wants to out these people as conservatives or libertarians, and they won’t want to be outed that way in Madison,"" Esenberg said. 
Our rating 
The Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty contended that, according to Soglin himself, the proposed ordinance ""is intended to discourage contributions to organizations with which he disagrees."" 
The group cites a newspaper interview that paraphrased Soglin saying that could happen in some cases as a result of his legislation. Soglin told us the same thing, but said his goal was limited to transparency. 
His statements make pretty clear he looks forward to forcing contractors to choose between trimming their political activity or disclosing it and facing the consequences. And he predicts some will stop making donations.

Rep. Dave Joyce says the IRS must carry out 47 provisions of the health care law
","
A number of Republican lawmakers recently have sought to link two longtime targets of conservatives: President Barack Obama’s health care law and the Internal Revenue Service, which is under fire for its role in scrutinizing some Tea Party groups and others. 
PolitiFact, like our colleagues at FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker, has examined several related claims from lawmakers including Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. 
We rated as False the claim that the IRS is ""going to be in charge of our health care."" We found the claim that the IRS will be in charge of ""a huge national database"" on health care that will include Americans’ ""personal, intimate, most close-to-the-vest-secrets"" so ridiculous that we gave it our Pants on Fire! rating. 
Rep. David Joyce of Russell Township made a claim that looked to have a more solid foundation in a Tweet posted June 5: 
""47 - New provisions ObamaCare charges the IRS with implementing, according to the Government Accountability Office."" 
We quickly found the source, the GAO's report to Congress of June 2012, and we did not have to look far into it. 
The report begins: ""The Internal Revenue Service's implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is a massive undertaking that involves 47 statutory provisions and extensive coordination across not only IRS, but multiple agencies and external partners."" 
That backs up Joyce's statement. But we thought knowing more about  the 47 provisions would be useful. 
The IRS has posted a list of its roles in implementing the health care law, which include everything from levying additional payroll taxes on certain high-income Americans to taxation of medical devices and brand-name drugs. Among the key roles are approving subsidies for Americans seeking insurance on newly created health exchanges, and confirming that taxpayers have health insurance -- and assessing a financial penalty if they do not. (The penalties start at $95 per adult in 2013 and rise to $695 per adult in 2016.) 
The revenue provisions are vital to the health care law, the Treasury Department Inspector General said in a report this year. 
""Revenue provisions contained in the legislation are designed to generate $438 billion to help pay for the overall cost of health care reform,"" the report said. ""More than 40 of these provisions added to or amended the Internal Revenue Code and represent the largest set of tax law changes the IRS has had to implement in more than 20 years."" 
""Indeed,"" the Post's Fact Checker noted, ""the Supreme Court upheld the law precisely because the individual mandate fell within Congress’s taxation power (even though the Obama administration had tried hard to claim this was not a tax)."" 
Other federal agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, are also involved in implementation of the law. Far more responsibility falls on the Department of Health and Human Services, which has taken the lead in organizing its implementation, providing information to the public about the law and providing oversight.

Progress Texas says two-thirds of groups targeted for IRS scrutiny were not conservative
","
Amid fallout from the IRS’s admission that it improperly targeted conservative groups, Democratic-leaning Progress Texas suggested the agency’s net was cast wider, tweeting that ""2/3 of groups scrutinized were not conservatives."" 
That May 31, 2013, statement wasn’t the first time the nonprofit advocacy group made such a claim; a May 17 post on its website said, ""Two-thirds of those groups that received extra scrutiny from the IRS were not conservative."" 
Context: The IRS apologized May 10, 2013, for singling out tax-exemption applications from groups whose names included ""tea party,"" ""patriot"" or ""9/12."" The organizations were seeking exemption from federal taxes either as charitable groups with IRS designation 501(c)3 or as social welfare groups, which are allowed to engage in limited political activity without disclosing donors, under IRS designation 501(c)4. 
Since then, groups of varied political stripes including Progress Texas have spoken up to say their own applications drew extra scrutiny. 
We asked how Progress Texas concluded that most of the groups were not conservative. Political director Phillip Martin told us by email that the statement was based on a May 12, 2013, Washington Post news story about a leaked report from the U.S. Treasury inspector general that the government released two days later. 
The Post story said that according to the report, ""Of the 298 groups selected for special scrutiny ... 72 had ‘tea party’ in their title, 13 had ‘patriot’ and 11 had ‘9/12.’ "" That equaled 96 groups, Martin said, or 32.2 percent of the declared 298. 
Were the other 202 groups nonconservative? Neither the report nor the story described those groups, and Progress Texas did not reply to our follow-up requests for relevant information. 
The IRS said in a May 15, 2013, press release that the groups without ""tea party"" in their names ""included organizations of all political views."" 
Precisely what happened from May 2010 through May 2012 at the agency’s Cincinnati, Ohio, office, where all such tax-exemption applications are processed, has not become clear. 
But according to the inspector general’s report, IRS workers were instructed to look for indications of applicants’ political views and activities, including some broad descriptions but also others aimed at conservatives. 
For instance, the report says staffers were asked to flag groups educating Americans about the Constitution, which is a stated goal of the 9/12 Project, an activist organization founded by conservative broadcaster Glenn Beck. 
According to the report, the IRS criteria included: 
In U.S. House hearings May 17 and 22, 2013, lawmakers questioned acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller and the Treasury’s inspector general, J. Russell George, about the 202 unlabeled groups. 
On May 22, Miller said that ""202 non-Tea Party cases... were reviewed for indications of significant political campaign intervention, which was our key criteria,"" helping to determine whether a group’s activities affected its eligibility for the 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) designations. ""We did not evaluate whether or not they were conservative groups, or -- or progressive groups, or liberal groups, or whatever term you want to use,"" Miller said. 
Asked May 17 whether liberal buzz words such as ""progressive"" or ""organizing"" also were used to identify groups for scrutiny, Miller said they were not. 
IRS employees, Miller said May 17, were grouping similar applications together for efficiency. The method they used, he said, ""while intolerable, was a mistake and not an act of partisanship."" 
George said his report did not break out the political makeup of the 202 groups because it looked only at the names of the organizations: ""Certain names were so generic that we were unable to determine whether or not they had a particular point of view."" 
A full breakdown of the scrutinized groups, or even types of groups, might not surface. On May 20, 2013, Senate Finance Committee leaders asked the IRS for information including the names of the 298 targeted groups; they had not received the names as of June 6, 2013, committee spokeswoman Julia Lawless told us via email. 
Our ruling 
Progress Texas has twice said that two-thirds of the groups whose applications for tax-exempt status were scrutinized by the IRS were not conservative. 
The group’s fraction appears to be an unsupported assumption tied to a government report saying that 96 of 298 IRS-scrutinized organizations, or about a third, had ""tea party,"" ""patriot"" or ""9/12"" in their names. The report listed other criteria the IRS used, some of which appeared to be aimed at conservatives. 
But the report has no information on the political makeup of the other groups, and we see no other indications that their political leanings have been authoritatively summed up or individually revealed, though the IRS has said the scrutinized groups without ""tea party"" in their names reflected ""all political views,"" which presumably would fold in liberals to moderates to conservatives.

"['National', 'Children', 'Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Pundits', 'Rush Limbaugh']","
Rush Limbaugh says HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was the ""one person"" to determine fate of 10-year-old lung patient Sarah Murnaghan
","Many Americans were transfixed recently by the story of Sarah Murnaghan, a 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl with cystic fibrosis whose family won a court battle to improve her chances of getting a lung transplant. Under the existing transplant rule, Murnaghan was too young to qualify for a place on the waiting list for adult lungs. So the girl’s family asked Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, to waive the rule. On May 31, 2013, Sebelius did order a policy review of the age requirements, but that option could take months -- likely longer than the girl could afford to wait. Sebelius declined to waive the rule in a way that would quickly aid her. Sebelius explained her reasoning to a House committee, saying ""there are about 40 very seriously ill Pennsylvanians over the age of 12 also waiting for a lung transplant, and three other children in the Philadelphia (area) at the same acuity rate as Sarah waiting for a lung transplant. The decisions of the … transplant committee -- which is not bureaucrats; it's transplant surgeons and health care providers who design the protocol -- are based on their best medical judgment of the most appropriate way to decide allocation in an impossibly difficult situation."" But Sebelius found herself overruled on June 5, 2013, when U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson ordered her to temporarily waive the rule, allowing Murnaghan to join the adult list. At the House committee hearing, two Republican lawmakers -- Reps. Tom Price of Georgia and Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania-- grilled Sebelius about her role in the Murnaghan case. Soon after, conservative commentators, including Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh, took up the 10-year-old’s cause and used it to criticize the Obama administration. Sebelius had already been under attack from conservatives for her role in implementing President Barack Obama’s health care law. In discussing the Murnaghan case, Limbaugh drew a parallel with Sarah Palin's famous ""death panels"" claim, which suggested that the government could determine who lives and dies. (We awarded it our 2009 Lie of the Year.) On his June 6 show, Limbaugh told listeners, ""Until the judge moved in, Kathleen Sebelius was the death panel. One person, Kathleen Sebelius, was going to determine whether or not (Murnaghan lived or died), and she said, ‘Some people live. Some people die.’ … All the while, the regime is denying, of course, that there were death panels and that Obamacare was not going to be doing this, and everybody knew that it was."" We wondered whether Limbaugh was correct when he said that Sebelius was the sole decision maker. Where Limbaugh has a point Limbaugh is correct that Sebelius did have the power to overrule the age requirements of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network -- the entity that oversees transplants in the United States. According to the current organ-transplant rules, which were adopted under President Bill Clinton, the network’s board of directors is responsible for developing ""policies for the equitable allocation"" of organs. However, the rules allow an appeals process to the HHS secretary. The secretary can either reject the complaint, direct the network to ""revise the policies or practices"" or ""take such other action as the secretary determines appropriate."" It’s worth noting that the HHS secretary has not traditionally taken a hands-on role overseeing day-to-day transplant policy. And historically, a decision to change the rules based on one or two patients’ cases would be unusual, said I. Glenn Cohen, co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School. Still, Tait Sye, an HHS spokesman, did not dispute that Sebelius had a role in the process. He said that Sebelius’ decision not to issue a waiver -- at least until told by the judge to do so -- stemmed from her belief that medical experts, not a government official, should take priority. ""The interest of patients on the transplant list will not be well served by having an individual reach in and unilaterally change an organ allocation policy,"" Sye said. Given the specifics of the Murnaghan case, we think it’s reasonable to say that Sebelius, in her role as a source of appeal for the transplantation network, had a role in determining the likelihood of the girl being placed on a transplant list. How Limbaugh ignored others involved in the decision The problem with Limbaugh’s claim is that he uses the term ""one person,"" boiling down what amounts to a life-or-death question to Sebelius alone. That’s not accurate. For starters, if Sebelius had given her blessing immediately to the transplant-list switch, it wouldn’t have determined Murnaghan’s life or death. Switching Murnaghan to the adult list would likely improve her chance of survival, but whether she actually survives depends on the availability of organs, whether they match with Murnaghan’s blood type, who else ranks ahead of her on the list, how well her own health holds up while awaiting surgery, and how successful the transplant surgery is. More importantly, the system for deciding who gets organ transplants includes several layers of responsibility. The guidelines were put together in an exhaustive rulemaking process, with wide public input. On an ongoing basis, the medical experts on the network’s board interpret and enforce these rules. Then, Sebelius serves as a court of appeal. Finally, a federal judge has the power to overrule her appeal, as one did in this case. So there are many people who collectively enforce and interpret the rules. ""The national organ-allocation network is developed around a consensus of medical expertise and is meant to apply to all transplant candidates ... not to apply uniquely to one individual,"" said Joel Newman, a spokesman for the United Network for Organ Sharing, which manages the organ-sharing network under contract to the Department of Health and Human Services. Newman added that the rules ""are designed to provide as many individuals as possible an equitable opportunity to receive a transplant."" Several bioethicists we contacted said that despite the obvious sympathy people have for patients like Murnaghan, Sebelius had sound reasons to act as she did. ""I don't think it would be proper to change the rules for one person rather than alter the entirety of the criteria for who gets priority,"" Cohen said. Arthur Caplan, a New York University bioethicist, agreed. ""The system of rules is built on decisions by medical and transplant experts in the area, in this case lungs,"" he said. ""No one person can or should have all authority over rationing organs. Appeals to the government or the courts need to be weighed carefully, because by intervening, the authority and legitimacy of an evidence-based, neutral system is put into doubt, and that is not a good thing for society or those waiting for transplants."" Jonathan Moreno, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, noted that a switch in Murnaghan’s status is not risk-free. ""Her medical condition, size and other factors compromise her chances, and a failure here means two dead -- Sarah, and the patient who didn't get the organ,"" Moreno said. Our ruling Limbaugh said that ""one person, Kathleen Sebelius, was going to determine whether or not"" 10-year-old lung patient Sarah Murnaghan would live or die, essentially serving as a one-woman ""death panel."" It’s true that Sebelius played an appeals role in the transplant-policy process. However, she was not the only person or entity that did -- existing rules, medical experts and a federal judge also played a role in Murnaghan’s case. In addition, Sebelius didn’t have the power to grant or revoke life; many factors, including the availability and suitability of organs, will ultimately determine her likelihood of survival. On balance, we rate Limbaugh’s claim Mostly False.

"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Bill Nelson']","
Bill Nelson says Rick Scott returned a $1 million grant to strengthen reviews of insurance rates
","
Sen. Bill Nelson did not have high hopes when he pressured Gov. Rick Scott to veto an insurance regulation bill that Nelson said could harm consumers. 
Nelson, a Democrat who used to be the state’s insurance commissioner, asked Scott to veto SB 1842, which prevents state regulators from reviewing rate hikes for new plans in 2014 and 2015 as the federal health care law is implemented. 
""Given the governor’s recent decision to return $1 million in federal funding that would have helped the state cover the cost of overseeing insurance rates under the new health care law, and the fact that he has not even applied for another $5 million in federal funding that is available to help states control their insurance markets, I’m not holding my breath,"" he wrote in an op-ed. 
As Nelson predicted, Scott signed the bill. 
""Rates for new plans will be reviewed by the same federal government that will be enforcing and updating the new rules and regulations throughout this very fluid and uncertain transition period,"" Scott wrote in a message. 
In Nelson’s view, Scott and Republican legislators are setting up the federal government to take the fall for increased rates. His column left us wondering whether Scott really rejected $1 million for overseeing insurance rate hikes. 
Scott didn’t want fed money 
The task blasted us back to 2011, when the novice politician took office on a tea party-infused platform against Obamacare and big government. He and Republican leaders made a name for Florida by spurning million-dollar grants for the health care law despite having one of the highest uninsured populations and a $3.7 billion budget hole in 2011-12. 
State leaders yearned for the law to be overturned or repealed, and their hopes heightened when a federal district judge in Pensacola ruled the law unconstitutional shortly after Scott took office. Scott explained to the New York Times in July 2011 that it did not make sense to ""waste either federal money or state money on something that’s unconstitutional.""  
We found news accounts saying Scott ordered state agencies to reject health care money. We could not turn up such a directive via public record requests, but we found lots of evidence of Scott talking about rejecting health care money. 
  Among the grants Florida rejected: $8.3 million for a community health center, $4.2 million for moving long-term care patients out of nursing homes, $2.8 million for prevention of teen pregnancy and STDs, $1 million for insurance exchange planning grants and, yes, $1 million for beefing up reviews of insurance premium increases. 
""Things that are simply implementing the Affordable Health Care Act, or Obamacare, I’m not going to support because I believe this: It’s the biggest job killer in our state, we can’t afford it and it’s going to be bad for patients,"" Scott said in a 2011 AP story. 
Scott elaborated on C-SPAN’s Washington Journal. 
The grant 
Now let’s get into the rate review grant, among the smaller grants the feds tried to award Florida to prepare for the health care law. 
The health care law set aside $250 million over five years to help states beef up their scrutiny of rate hike requests. Under the law, any double-digit proposed rate increase by individual or small group market insurers must be closely examined ""to make sure it is justified."" 
Florida intended to use its $1 million award to expand its rate review coverage to large group and out-of-state companies; create new premium filing requirements; hire more actuaries; and make it easier for consumers to search premium increase filings on the state insurance regulators’ website. (Read a summary of Florida’s application here.) 
The state got the money in August 2010, when Florida’s governor was Charlie Crist. In an acceptance letter, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty wrote, ""The Office looks forward to our collaboration with the Office of Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight as we move forward to use the grant funds to enhance the rate review process in Florida."" 
McCarty addressed the letter to Jay Angoff, director of the federal Office of Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight within the Department of Health and Human Services. McCarty made personal touches to the letter, crossing out the typed ""Director Angoff"" and writing ""Jay."" At the bottom, he scrawled, ""Great to visit with you in Vermont!"" 
McCarty’s next letter to Angoff on the subject on Feb. 1, 2011, lacked congeniality and an explanation. It came after the November 2010 elections that saw Crist out of office and Scott in, and after a Florida district judge ruled that the health care law was unconstitutional (the judge, Roger Vinson, said states should keep implementing the law because the matter would be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court). 
McCarty’s letter contained two sentences: ""The purpose of this letter is to inform you that after deliberate consideration, I hereby rescind acceptance of the above-referenced $1 million rate review grant, which occurred in a letter to you dated September 15, 2010. No drawdown of any of the $1 million will occur."" 
Angoff, who left his post at HHS in December 2012 to work for the D.C. law firm Mehri Skalet, told us the change of heart did not surprise him ""once it became clear that many of the Republicans were just so maniacally opposed to cooperating with the Affordable Care Act."" 
Florida, Idaho and Oklahoma were the only states to return rate review grants, and four others did not apply. 
What changed? 
We were left with simple questions: Why did OIR return the money, and who ordered it? 
Let’s start from the top -- of the rejection letter’s masthead. 
McCarty’s office is overseen by the Financial Services Commission, a four-person body comprised of the governor and Cabinet. The 2010 election kicked out moderate-to-liberal members Crist and Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink and ushered in Scott and three anti-Obama Republicans. McCarty, who took over for Nelson as commissioner in 2003, is appointed by the commission. 
Asked directly if Scott rejected the grant or told McCarty to return it, both the governor’s office and Office of Insurance Regulation sidestepped the question. Spokesmen initially sent a 2010 letter from then-House Speaker Dean Cannon to Crist regarding agencies implementing the federal health care law without ""waiting for clear and comprehensive guidance from the Legislature."" 
Cannon’s greatest concern was the Office of Insurance Regulation. The federal government was ""commandeering"" the office, he wrote, which was was developing a system for enforcing new regulations. ""Although OIR used routine budget mechanisms to commence these actions with federal grant money, the substantive actions must be subject to more thorough legislative scrutiny,"" he wrote. 
Cannon told agencies to submit a detailed list of activities related to the health care law and not to take any more actions to implement the law after Nov. 15, 2010. He did not say OIR needed to return the grant. 
OIR spokeswoman Amy Bogner sent us a vague statement that did not explain the reason: ""The Office had the authority to draw down funds. The Office did not draw down the funds. The Office was not directed to take this action. We do not have any further comment."" 
We searched news clips. The grant did not generate much attention at the time, often lopped in with more expensive ones. 
McCarty was quoted by the Tampa Bay Business Journal as saying part of the reason he rescinded acceptance of the grant was the federal government’s criticism of a Connecticut regulator approving a rate increase of as much as 47 percent. 
""We hadn’t drawn down the money, we were concerned about its encroachment on state sovereignty, and yesterday’s decision just made it a cinch,"" McCarty said in the April 1, 2011 story, referring to the district judge’s ruling. 
Former Scott spokesman Lane Wright told us for a 2011 fact-check that the governor’s staff examined each grant to determine whether it was intended to implement health care reform. 
""Some grants were not applied for and some grants applied for under the Crist administration were returned because they were meant specifically for the implementation of Obamacare,"" Wright wrote. 
Listed as an example: the premium review grant. 
Our ruling 
Nelson said Scott returned ""$1 million in federal funding that would have helped the state cover the cost of overseeing insurance rates under the new health care law."" 
It is undeniable that a grant for that purpose in that amount was sought, and a grant was returned. But the official who technically returned the money was the state’s insurance commissioner, a political appointee who answers to Scott as part of his role on the Financial Services Commission. Still, he did so shortly after Scott took office and Scott’s office claimed some amount of credit back in 2011.

"['Afghanistan', 'National', 'Alan Grayson']","
Polls on Afghanistan show a mixed picture
","
President Barack Obama gave a major speech Dec. 1 to make the case for increasing troops in Afghanistan. But antiwar Democrats still say it's the wrong decision.


One of those Democrats is Rep. Alan Grayson of Florida. The night before Obama's speech, Grayson appeared on MSNBC's

The Ed Show

to argue against sending more troops.


""We have people now who are in first grade and second grade who have never known an America their entire lives that was an America at peace. And I think it's time we thought about that, thought about what we're like as human beings and as a country. We need to pursue peace,"" Grayson said.


Host Ed Schultz asked Grayson what should be done to oppose the policy.


""What we always do,"" Grayson said. ""Organize, organize and organize. Tell the president, tell our elected representatives, and hope that we can build bridges among enough congressmen so that we can tell the president honestly that this war should be over. And I've been following the polls and I've seen that, in the case of Afghanistan, the polls are shifting. In the past year, more than 20 percent of Americans have changed their mind about the war in Afghanistan. They conclude we shouldn't be there. And that's what we need to do. We need to change people's minds.""


We wondered if Grayson was right about a dramatic shift in the polls on the war in Afghanistan. As usual with polls, a lot depends on how you ask the question.


We asked Grayson's staff what polls he was referring to, and they pointed us to a USA Today/Gallup poll taken from Nov. 20-22, 2009.


The poll question: ""Do you approve or disapprove of the way Barack Obama is handling the situation in Afghanistan?"" The poll showed a 20-point drop in approval for Obama. In July, 56 percent of respondents said they approved of how he was handling Afghanistan. In November, 35 percent approved.


But we don't think approving of Obama's handling of Afghanistan is quite the same as saying Americans ""have changed their mind about the war in Afghanistan"" and think we ""shouldn't be there.""


More on point might be the Gallup poll that asked the question, ""Thinking now about U.S. military action in Afghanistan that began in October 2001, do you think the United States made a mistake in sending military forces to Afghanistan, or not?"" The answer to that question has been relatively stable. In November, 60 percent said no, we didn't make a mistake. In July, it was 61 percent, and in August 2008, it was 63 percent.


We also found this question from the ABC News/Washington Post poll: ""All in all, considering the costs to the United States versus the benefits to the United States, do you think the war in Afghanistan has been worth fighting, or not?"" In November, 44 percent said yes, it has been worth it. In July that number was 51 percent, and last December it was 55 percent. That's a decline of about 11 points, not more than 20.


In reviewing a number of polls about Afghanistan, the approval for Obama's handling of Afghanistan has seen a particularly wide swing this year. This could be because he's displeasing both antiwar Democrats and more conservative Republicans. We should also note that these polls were before his speech, and that it's possible such a high-profile speech could improve Obama's ratings. 


Grayson said, ""In the past year, more than 20 percent of Americans have changed their mind about the war in Afghanistan. They conclude we shouldn't be there."" But that 20 percent number represents displeasure with Obama and not the dropoff in support for the war, which is at just 11 percent. And another measurement -- whether people believe the United States made a mistake by sending forces to the country -- has remained stable. So we rate the statement Barely True.

Murtha claims the U.S. will have more troops in Afghanistan than Russia
","
Rep. John Murtha, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee who chairs its defense subcommittee, is one of the Democrats concerned about President Barack Obama's plan to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan.

 

On

Hardball With Chris Matthew

s on Dec. 2, 2009, Murtha said he was worried about the cost and complexity of Obama's strategy.

 

""This is a very complicated thing and very costly operation,"" said Murtha, D-Pa. ""So you know, we got a lot of problems facing us, 104,000 contractors already in Afghanistan, in addition to the 68,000 troops. We're going to have more troops, Chris, than the Russians had in Afghanistan.""

 

Murtha said ""Russians,"" but it was clear that he was referring to the Soviet Union, which was still intact when its troops invaded Afghanistan in 1979. Murtha's comments got us wondering whether the United States would have more troops stationed in the country than the Soviet Union did after it invaded.
 
First, Murtha's claim deserves a little background on Afghanistan's stormy relationship with the Soviet Union. It all started in April 1978, when Afghanistan's communist People's Democratic Party staged a coup and renamed the country the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. In the following months, the U.S.S.R. sent troops to Afghanistan to help fend off Islamic insurgents there. What started out as an aid operation turned into a full-scale invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. The Soviet-Afghan war lasted nine years.

 

Estimates of the Soviet troops vary. In 1989, when the last Soviet soldiers left Afghanistan, the

New York Times

reported that there had been 115,000 troops at the height of the war.

Other


estimates


peg

the number at 118,000 and 120,000.

 

Currently, the United States has approximately 68,000 troops in Afghanistan, and is planning to send 30,000 more, bringing the total number to about 100,000.

 

So, Murtha is off by at least 15,000 troops. The Soviets had more.

 

We asked Murtha's office about his statement, and his spokesman, Matt Mazonkey, said the congressman is right if NATO allies are included. Indeed, including foreign troops would

bring the number up

to 140,000.
 
Murtha did not make this clear on

Hardball;

we believe most viewers would interpret his ""we"" to mean the United States. But since the United States is directing the effort, it's conceivable that some might include the total force with NATO allies, in which case Murtha would be correct. So we rate his  statement Barely True.

Obama says 'extremists' sent to U.S. from Afghanistan-Pakistan border area
","
President Barack Obama has decided to increase the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, and he made the case for the increase in a speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y.


""I make this decision because I am convinced that our security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan,"" Obama said. ""This is the epicenter of violent extremism practiced by al-Qaida. It is from here that we were attacked on 9/11, and it is from here that new attacks are being plotted as I speak.


""This is no idle danger; no hypothetical threat. In the last few months alone, we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror. And this danger will only grow if the region slides backwards, and al-Qaida can operate with impunity. We must keep the pressure on al-Qaida, and to do that, we must increase the stability and capacity of our partners in the region.""


An alert reader asked us about Obama's comments on capturing extremists in the United States who had been sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan.


He was apparently referring to the case of Najibullah Zazi, a 24-year-old Colorado resident whom authorities arrested on Sept. 19, 2009. Zazi was charged with conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction.


Authorities say Zazi received training from al-Qaida in Pakistan on how to build explosives and was constructing a bomb from chemicals he purchased at a beauty supply shop in Colorado. Zazi then traveled to New York City on Sept. 10 ""in furtherance of the criminal plan,"" according to the Justice Department. Authorities say he left the city after being tipped off that he was under surveillance; he was arrested a short time later.


Zazi is actually a legal resident of the United States. His family arrived in the United States in the early 1990s, according to news reports, and Zazi went to high school in New York City, speaks fluent English, and ran a coffee cart for several years in lower Manhattan. Zazi has traveled to Pakistan several times to visit friends and family, and authorities say it was during his last trip at the end of 2008 that Zazi went to an al-Qaida-run training camp and received instructions in explosives and weapons.


His attorney said Zazi did travel to Pakistan and purchase items at the supply shop, but neither of those activities are illegal, and that the government has not indicted anyone else to prove charges of conspiracy. (Zazi's father and another man were arrested on charges of lying to investigators.) Prosecutors told a judge on Dec. 3 that they expect to file additional charges soon.


Obama said during his speech, ""In the last few months alone, we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror."" Is it fair to say Zazi was ""sent here"" from the border region? We could argue this point, since Zazi lived in the United States for many years, but it seems trivial: If people receive training in al-Qaida camps in the border region to commit acts of terror, does it really matter if they were originally from that region or just visiting temporarily? We'll note here for clarity's sake that Zazi was a U.S. resident who allegedly visited the training camps before returning to the United States.


We don't believe it's quite accurate for Obama to flatly state that the arrested men were intent on committing ""new acts of terror"" when the trial has not yet started. In fact, there are many questions surrounding the case, most notably who Zazi's co-conspirators might have been. The other two men arrested so far were charged with lying to investigators, not committing acts of terror. If a court had convicted Zazi, we would likely rate Obama's statement True. The Justice Department is backing Obama's statement, but these men have not been convicted. Given that, we rate Obama's statement Mostly True.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Pundits', 'Glenn Beck']","
Beck says less than 10 percent of Obama Cabinet has worked in private sector
","Fox News talk show host Glenn Beck has seized on a claim circulating on the Internet to argue that the Obama administration has little understanding of American business and is too focused on expanding government.
 
""History has proven over and over again — and so has the post office, for that matter — that government is not the answer,"" Beck said on his Nov. 30, 2009, show. ""You need to unleash the people. The entrepreneurs. And if you are wondering how it is that the government can't see that — how they can be pondering even bigger stimulus packages as they stare the failure of the first one right in the face — I'll show you. Here are the past presidents and the number of appointees in their Cabinets with private sector experience — folks that have done more than write on the chalkboard; they've been out there, in the real world. Let's compare President Nixon — he's over 50 percent — with President Obama: Under 10 percent of his appointees have any experience in the private sector.""
 
We did a little digging and found that the claim is based on a study by Michael Cembalest, the chief investment officer for J.P. Morgan Private Bank. In a Nov. 24, 2009, column titled ""Obama's Business Blind Spot"" and published on Forbes.com, Cembalest wrote, ""In a quest to see what frame of reference the administration might have on this issue, I looked back at the history of the presidential Cabinet. Starting with the creation of the secretary of commerce back in 1900, I compiled the prior private-sector experience of all 432 Cabinet members, focusing on those positions one would expect to participate in this discussion: secretaries of State; Commerce; Treasury; Agriculture; Interior; Labor; Transportation; Energy; and Housing & Urban Development.""
 
He continued, ""Many of these individuals started a company or ran one, with first-hand experience in hiring and firing, domestic and international competition, red tape, recessions, wars and technological change. Their industries included agribusiness, chemicals, finance, construction, communications, energy, insurance, mining, publishing, pharmaceuticals, railroads and steel; a cross-section of the American experience. (I even gave [one-third] credit to attorneys focused on private-sector issues, although one could argue this is a completely different kettle of fish.) One thing is clear: The current administration, compared with past Democratic and Republican ones, marks a departure from the traditional reliance on a balance of public- and private-sector experiences.""
 
In an accompanying chart, Cembalest reported that in the Obama administration, fewer than 10 percent of the Cabinet appointees counted under those rules had private sector experience. According to the chart, all other administrations going back to Theodore Roosevelt's had rates in at least the high 20s, with the Eisenhower and Reagan administrations approaching 60 percent. (He wrote in a footnote that the data came from a number of sources, including capsule biographies of Cabinet members posted on the Web site of the University of Virginia's Miller Center for Public Affairs.)
 
The chart — typically reprinted by itself, without Cembalest's accompanying narrative — circulated in the conservative blogosphere for a couple of days before eventually being picked up by Beck.
 
We wondered if the claim was right, so we did some math of our own.
 
In Obama's Cabinet, at least three of the nine posts that Cembalest and Beck cite — a full one-third — are occupied by appointees who, by our reading of their bios, had significant corporate or business experience. Shaun Donovan, Obama's secretary of Housing and Urban Development, served as managing director of Prudential Mortgage Capital Co., where he oversaw its investments in affordable housing loans.  
 
Energy Secretary Steven Chu headed the electronics research lab at one of America's storied corporate research-and-development facilities, AT&T Bell Laboratories, where his work won a Nobel Prize for physics. And Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, in addition to serving as Colorado attorney general and a U.S. senator, has been a partner in his family's farm for decades and, with his wife, owned and operated a Dairy Queen and radio stations in his home state of Colorado.

Three other Obama appointees had legal experience in the private sector.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke spent part of their careers working as lawyers in private practice. Clinton and Vilsack worked as private-sector lawyers at the beginning of their careers, while Locke joined an international law firm, Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, after serving as governor of Washington state. At the firm, Locke ""co-chaired the firm's China practice"" and ""helped U.S. companies break into international markets,"" according to his official biography. That sounds like real private sector experience to us.

Finally, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner worked for Kissinger Associates, a consulting firm that advises international corporations on political and economic conditions overseas.

The occupants of the two remaining Cabinet posts cited in the chart do not appear to have had significant private-sector experience: Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood.

Obama's Cabinet has even more private-sector experience if you go beyond the nine. Two of the Obama appointees could be considered entrepreneurs — the very people Beck would ""unleash."" Vice President Joe Biden, officially a Cabinet member, founded his own law firm, Biden and Walsh, early in his career, and it still exists in a later incarnation, Monzack Mersky McLaughlin and Browder, P.A. (The future vice president also supplemented his income by managing properties, including a neighborhood swimming pool.) And Office of Management and Budget director Peter Orszag founded an economic consulting firm called Sebago Associates that was later bought out by a larger firm.

It's also worth noting that if you examine a larger group of senior Obama administration appointees, you'll find that more than one in four have experience as business executives, according to a June study by  National Journal  . That compared with the 38 percent the magazine found eight years earlier at the start of George W. Bush's administration. That's at least three times higher than the level claimed by Beck.

We tracked down Cembalest to ask about his methodology. He said any effort to address the topic is heavily subjective, and he expressed regret that his work had been used for political ends, saying that it was not his intention to provide fodder for bloggers and talk show hosts.

Cembalest said that he did discount the corporate experience of the three lawyers we identified — Clinton, Vilsack and Locke — and added that he awarded nothing for Donovan, Chu or Salazar, even though we found they had a fair amount private sector experience. Cembalest acknowledged fault in missing Salazar's business background, saying he would have given him a full point if he had it to do over again. But he added that the kind of private-sector experiences Chu and Donovan had (managing scientific research and handling community development lending, respectively) did not represent the kind of private-sector business experience he was looking for when doing his study.

""What I was really trying to get at was some kind of completely, 100 percent subjective assessment of whether or not a person had had enough control of payroll, dealing with shareholders, hiring, firing and risk-taking that they'd be in a position to have had a meaningful seat at the table when the issue being discussed is job creation,"" Cembalest said.
 
Cembalest said he has ""written 250,000 words in research over the last decade, and every single thing I've ever done — except this one chart — was empirically based on data from the Federal Reserve"" or another official source. ""This is the one time I stepped out into making judgment calls, and I assure you I won't do it again. ... The frightening thing about the Internet is that people copy one chart from what you write and then it goes viral. So I've learned a lesson here that these kinds of issues are best left addressed by the people who practice them day in and day out.""

Which brings us back to how Beck used Cembalest's data. We'll acknowledge that rating someone's degree of private-sector experience is an inexact science, and it's true that Beck accurately relayed the information contained in Cembalest's chart. But at PolitiFact we hold people accountable for their own words. So we rate Beck's claim False.","[('Fox News Channel,  comments  by Glenn Beck, Nov. 30, 2009\n\xa0\nMichael Cembalest, ""  Obama\'s Business Blind Spot  ,"" Forbes.com, Nov. 24, 2009\n\xa0\nThe Enterprise Blog, ""Help Wanted, No Private Sector Experience Required"" (  blog post  ), Nov. 25, 2009\n\xa0\nNational Journal  , ""  Obama\'s Team: The Face Of Diversity  ,"" June 20, 2009\n\nUniversity of Virginia\'s Miller Center on Public Affairs,  home page  for Barack Obama and his cabinet, accessed Dec. 2, 2009\n\xa0\nThe White House, cabinet  home page  , accessed Dec. 2, 2009\n\nNew York Times  , ""  New York Housing Chief Is Chosen for Cabinet  ,"" Dec. 13, 2008\n\nNew York Times  , ""Times Topics""  profile  of Steven Chu, March 23, 2009\n\nNational Journal  , Decisionmakers  profile  of Ken Salazar, June 20, 2009\n\nWashingtonian  magazine, ""  Joe Biden: \'Everyone Calls Me Joe  ,\'"" Feb. 1, 2009\n\nDelaware Today  , ""  Family Business: Beau Biden is the next Biden to watch.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Mitch McConnell']","
McConnell gets it right on medical malpractice reform
","
Republicans have a lot of concerns about the Senate health care bill, and one of their biggest is that it does not include any language to rein in lawsuits against doctors.

 

On Day 2 of the chamber's health care debate, Republican leader Mitch McConnell spoke about the issue on the Senate floor as he encouraged colleagues to send the bill back to committees for some major changes.

 

""Then we could start over and end junk lawsuits against doctors and hospitals that drive up costs, something the majority didn’t find any room for in their 2,074-page bill — not a word about controlling junk lawsuits against doctors and hospitals,"" McConnell said Dec. 1, 2009.

 

That claim has been echoed by other conservatives, including

Washington Post


columnist

Charles Krauthammer.

 

Their argument for limiting malpractice cases or their awards — supporters call it ""tort reform"" — involves saving money. If doctors are not scared of being sued, they're less likely to order unnecessary tests and procedures for their patients, thus reducing medical costs.

 

Indeed, a Congressional Budget Office report from 2004 says health care premiums have risen recently in part ""because insurance companies have faced increased costs to pay for claims (from growth in malpractice awards)."" More recently, the independent budget office said that medical malpractice reform could save up to $54 billion over the next 10 years.

 

President Barack Obama addressed the issue at a June meeting of the American Medical Association, saying, ""I recognize that it will be hard to make some of these changes if doctors feel like they're constantly looking over their shoulders for fear of lawsuits. ... I understand some doctors may feel the need to order more tests and treatments to avoid being legally vulnerable.""

 

Nevertheless, Obama said malpractice awards should not be capped, as many Republicans want, because he believes the caps can be unfair to people who are wrongfully harmed. 

 

Former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean, a physician, gave some insight into the issue

when it came up

in a Virginia town hall meeting last summer.


""Here's why tort reform is not in the bill: When you go to pass a really enormous bill like that the more stuff you put in it the more enemies you make,"" Dean said. ""The reason tort reform is not in the bill is because the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers in addition to everyone else they were taking on, and that is the plain and simple truth.""

 

So, Democrats have not included medical malpractice limits in either the House or Senate version of the bills. Instead, the administration has said it will give some states $3 million grants to test new approaches for limiting lawsuits.

 

The two bills don't completely ignore the issue.

 

The Senate bill includes nonbinding ""sense of the Senate"" language on page 1,858 that ""states should be encouraged to develop and test alternatives to the existing civil litigation system as a way of improving patient safety, reducing medical errors, encouraging the efficient resolution of disputes ... while preserving an individual's right to seek redress in court.""

 

The House bill establishes an incentive for states to adopt alternatives to traditional malpractice lawsuits, but those proposals cannot include provisions to limit attorney fees or impose caps on damages.


So, back to McConnell's claim. He said that the Senate bill does not include limits on medical malpractice litigation, and he is clearly correct. We rate his claim True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Mike Pence']","
Rep. Mike Pence says Democratic health plan would drive up family premiums
","One of the big questions for health care reform has been how the legislation would affect insurance premiums for consumers. On Nov. 30, the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, released a detailed analysis on how health insurance premiums might be affected by the Senate Democrats' health care bill. The CBO is a nonpartisan budget agency that calculates how much bills in Congress will cost the government. Their budget projections often make for solid political ammunition from proponents and opponents of various bills. So Republican Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana cited the report as evidence that the Democrats' plan would drive up family premiums. ""The CBO has confirmed what every American already knows, the Democrats' plan for a government takeover of health care will dramatically raise health care costs on working families,"" Pence said in a Nov. 30 press release. ""This latest CBO study reveals that the health care bill before the U.S. Senate will raise individual insurance premiums by up to 13 percent. That means every family that refuses the government's one-size-fits-all plan, will be forced to spend an additional $2,100 a year to keep their current health care."" The key qualifier in there -- likely missed by many not versed in insurance parlance -- is ""individual"" insurance premiums. The CBO broke its analysis of effects on premiums into three categories: • those in the small group market (generally people who get their insurance through businesses with up to 50 employees), which would make up about 13 percent of the total insurance market; • those in the large group market, which would account for about 70 percent of people; • those in the nongroup market, who would purchase their insurance as an individual through the government's health insurance ""exchange,"" which may or may not include a public option. Pence is talking about that last group of people, the nongroup market, which is expected to grow to about 17 percent of the insurance market in 2016. According to the report, the CBO estimates that the average premium per person in new nongroup policies would be about 10 percent to 13 percent higher in 2016 than the average premium for nongroup coverage under current law. More specifically, the average premiums per policy in the nongroup market in 2016 would be roughly $5,800 for single policies (up from $5,500 under current law) and $15,200 for family policies (up from $13,100 under current law). In other words, Pence is right that for some of this subset of Americans, their premiums could rise as much as 13 percent. But Pence fails to mention two key qualifiers. First, as the CBO report notes, the majority of nongroup enrollees (about 57 percent) would receive federal insurance subsidies, which on average would cover about two-thirds of the total premium. So for nongroup people getting subsidies, the amount they'd pay in premiums would be about 57 percent lower, on average, than what they would pay for nongroup coverage under current law. There's another flaw in Pence's statement. He says families would pay $2,100 more to keep ""their current health care."" In fact, much of what is driving up the cost of premiums in the nongroup market is that the government would require insurance companies in the exchange to offer a broader scope of benefits than most individual plans now include, an ""essential health benefits"" package that would match the benefits provided in most employer plans. So new nongroup policies would be required to cover a lot of things they don't currently cover -- things like maternity care, prescription drugs, and mental health and substance abuse treatment. Bottom line, it may cost more, but those people will be getting more insurance, and their out-of-pocket expense for medical needs should be smaller. According to the CBO report, an ""apples to apples"" comparison of the average price of equivalent insurance under the Democrats' plan would translate to an average premium of about 7 to 10 percent less than under current law. But our bigger problem with the Pence statement is the implication that the 13 percent rise in family health insurance premiums would apply to a larger group of people than it actually would. He says it would dramatically raise healthcare costs on working families. For the vast majority of people -- the five out of six nonelderly people who get their insurance through their employer -- the Democrats' plan would have a much smaller effect on premiums, the CBO concluded. In the small group market, employers with 50 or fewer workers, the CBO estimates the change in premiums would range from an increase of 1 percent to a decrease of 2 percent in 2016. In the large group market, premiums are projected to be zero to 3 percent lower in 2016 (relative to current law). In his press release, Pence takes a poke at President Barack Obama for failing to stick to his campaign promise to lower family premiums by $2,500. And on that front, Pence is accurate. The CBO analysis of the Senate Democrats' plan shows no such savings. We dealt with that claim separately on our Obameter, which tracks the progress of Obama's campaign promises. And we ruled it  Stalled.  But in this item, we're focused on Pence's claim that under the Democratic health plan, families ""will be forced to spend an additional $2,100 a year to keep their current health care."" That's only true for the roughly 8 percent of the market that purchases nongroup plans through the exchange and who don't receive a federal health insurance subsidy. According to the CBO, the vast majorty of working families -- who get their insurance through a large employer -- would actually see a slight decrease in premiums. It also does not account for the fact that the government would require individual policies to include better (more) coverage. And so we rule Pence's statement Barely True.

"['National', 'History', 'Pundits', 'Keith Olbermann']","
Olbermann says proposed GOP litmus test would freeze out Reagan
","To enforce ideological purity, a proposal before the Republican National Committee would deny party funding to any GOP candidate who bucks the party's stance on at least three items from a 10-point checklist of issues. The idea has sparked controversy within the Republican Party, and Democrats have seized on it as ammunition for their claim that the GOP has become too rigidly doctrinaire to appeal to many American voters.

Keith Olbermann, the liberal host of  Countdown  on MSNBC, welcomed the proposal on his Nov. 23, 2009, show as evidence that Republicans are out of the mainstream. Olbermann told viewers that the resolution -- which invoked the name of former President Ronald Reagan six times in its preamble -- would have effectively blackballed Reagan himself had it been in place during his political career. By Olbermann's count, the late conservative icon would have scored a measly four out of 10 -- just half of the eight he would have needed to secure financial backing from the party.
 
As we looked at the Republican proposal, we were struck by how specific its 10 items are to today's political environment. Reagan didn't have to consider wars in Iraq and Afghanistan or the prospect of gay marriage, for example. As a result, just a few of the checklist items can be directly compared to the issues Reagan faced, first during two terms as California governor and then as a two-term president. Because of this uncertainty, we won't rate Reagan -- or Olbermann -- in detail on each of the 10 issues. But if three problematic issues for Reagan exist, we think it's fair to say that he'd lose funds under the terms of today's proposal.
 
We'll start by pointing out the one issue of the 10 that presents a clear case of Reagan overstepping today's Republican orthodoxy:
 
• ""We support legal immigration and assimilation into American society by opposing amnesty for illegal immigrants.""
 
In 1986, Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which provided a path to amnesty for illegal immigrants who could prove that they had been in the United States for a certain period of time. Case closed.
 
In the meantime, we settled upon six issues that we don't think can be used as fair comparisons, even though Olbermann did cite a few of them as examples of Reagan's unorthodox behavior on related issues. They are:
 
• ""We support market-based health care reform and oppose Obama-style government-run health care.""
• ""We support market-based energy reforms by opposing cap and trade legislation.""
• ""We support workers’ right to secret ballot by opposing card check.""
• ""We support victory in Iraq and Afghanistan by supporting military-recommended troop surges.""
• ""We support containment of Iran and North Korea, particularly effective action to eliminate their nuclear weapons threat.""
• ""We support retention of the Defense of Marriage Act.""
 
While health care, energy policy, labor rights, military strategy, foreign affairs and gay rights were issues in Reagan's day just as they are today, we concluded that the battles in Reagan's time, and in ours, had enough unique factors that it's impossible to be sure what his actions then would have meant about the policy debates of today.
 
That leaves three issues to determine whether Olbermann is right that Reagan would have been denied GOP funding. One is:
 
• ""We support protecting the lives of vulnerable persons by opposing health care rationing and denial of health care and government funding of abortion.""
 
Six months into his governorship in 1967, Reagan signed the Therapeutic Abortion Act, which has been widely described as the most liberal abortion law in the nation before the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in  Roe vs. Wade  . Among other things, it permitted California's government-run Medicaid program to pay for abortions.
 
""Reagan later admitted that abortion had been 'a subject I’d never given much thought to,'"" wrote Paul Kengor and Patricia Clark Doerner, co-authors of ""The Judge: William P. Clark, Ronald Reagan’s Top Hand"" in the  National Review  , a conservative magazine. ""Moreover, his aides were divided on the question. ... Years later, Reagan remarked that he did 'more studying and soul searching' on the issue than any other as governor."" Ultimately, Kengor and Doerner wrote, Reagan signed the bill, fearing that the Legislature would be able to override his veto and pass an even more sweeping measure.
 
But that was far from the end of the story. Reagan biographer Lou Cannon told PolitiFact that ""one of the reasons that Reagan became an opponent of abortion is that so many abortions were performed under the Therapeautic Abortion Act of 1967"" -- more, even, than the bill's sponsors had envisioned. So, during the remainder of his political career, Reagan used his bully pulpit aggressively to oppose abortion. His presidential administration made some tangible antiabortion moves, such as instituting the ""Mexico City policy,"" which denied foreign aid funding to groups that ""perform or actively promote"" abortion.
 
The second is:
 
• ""We support the right to keep and bear arms by opposing government restrictions on gun ownership.""
 
As governor in 1967, Reagan signed the Mulford Act, which forbade the carrying of weapons in public. Later, in a 1991 speech, the former president spoke in favor of the Brady Bill -- a measure aggressively opposed by gun-rights groups that would establish a waiting period for gun purchases, so that law enforcement officials could conduct a background check on the purchaser. The law was named for Reagan's former press secretary, James Brady, who was seriously injured in John Hinckley's 1981 attempt on Reagan's life. (The bill was first introduced in Congress in 1987 and never made it to Reagan's desk during his presidency; Bill Clinton eventually signed it in 1993.)
 
Despite these two actions, Reagan, as president, was generally a supporter of gun rights. Upon his death in 2004, the National Rifle Association eulogized him as a ""hunter, rancher and outdoorsman,"" as a life member of the group, and as the first sitting president to address the NRA at an annual meeting. In addition, he signed the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986, which included some provisions that tightened rules on gun ownership but which also eased many existing rules on firearms. It is generally considered a victory for the NRA rather than for gun-control forces.
 
On both guns and abortion, then, Reagan unquestionably broke with today's Republican orthodoxy on one or more occasions -- but he also did things that were fully consistent with that orthodoxy.
 
Finally, we'll look at the item dealing with fiscal policy. It's a bit complicated because it contains four parts:
 
• ""We support smaller government, smaller national debt, lower deficits and lower taxes by opposing bills like Obama’s 'stimulus' bill""

Reagan gets unalloyed credit for sticking to the Republican principle of lowering taxes. When he entered office, the top marginal income tax rate was 70 percent. By the time he left office, it was 28 percent.  Measured another way  , the effective individual income tax rates dropped for Americans in many tax brackets, not just the richest.
 
Judging whether Reagan promoted ""smaller government"" is trickier. For starters, ""smaller government"" could be defined to include such intangible factors as decreased regulation rather than just federal outlays. But even looking at federal spending, the trendlines are somewhat contradictory. Overall federal outlays increased by 57 percent over eight years, or about 7 percent a year. However, much of that increase was driven by defense spending. Looking at nondefense discretionary spending, the rise was much more modest -- 16 percent over eight years, or about 2 percent a year. Because that was less than the average rate of inflation during his presidency, some economists would consider that a cut.
 
That said, it's pretty clear that Reagan didn't stick to the other two elements of this item -- deficits and debt.
 
The average annual deficit during Reagan's presidency was $167 billion, with shortfalls ranging from $79 billion to $221 billion. By contrast, his two immediate predecessors, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford never ran a deficit larger than $74 billion, and the president before them, Richard Nixon, never produced a deficit bigger than $23 billion. (Nixon even recorded a modest surplus in 1969.) As for the national debt, it rose from about $953 billion when Reagan took office to roughly $2.7 trillion when he left -- a bit less than three times its initial size.
 
So on this item, too, both sides can pick and choose their evidence to show that Reagan did, or didn't, adhere to Republican fiscal orthodoxy.
 
It's possible to draw at least two conclusions based on Reagan's example. One is that Reagan -- perhaps unhappily for ideologues on both the right and the left -- did not have immutable principles throughout his entire political life. He was a politician -- one who had to respond to his constituents, as well as to the specific demands and constraints of his office, whether it was governor or president.
 
The other conclusion to draw is that parties themselves do not necessarily have immutable principles. Reagan's biographer Cannon points out that at the time the California Legislature passed the abortion bill, ""more Republicans supported it than Democrats. That's because the issue was then seen almost entirely in religious terms, and there were more Roman Catholics among the Democratic legislators than the Republicans. In 1967, most Republicans agreed with the mantra of keeping the government out of the bedroom and the boardroom. ... So Reagan went along with the prevailing doctrine of his party at the time.""
 
Similarly, when the Legislature passed the Mulford Act, it won the support not just of liberal gun-control advocates but also of conservatives, who saw it as a way to weaken the growing power of the radical Black Panther movement, according to  Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law, Volume 1  .

When Reagan signed both the gun bill and the abortion bill, then, one can easily argue that he was actually adhering to the conservatism of the time, even as he bucked the conservatism of today. This contrast underscores the challenges facing Olbermann and others who seek to discredit the RNC proposal.
 
Indeed, the lead sponsor of the RNC resolution, James Bopp Jr., acknowledged as much after liberal attacks like Olbermann's began to emerge. According to the  New York Times  ' Caucus blog, Bopp ""noted that the principles would change over time. ... Many of these were not issues in the 1980s, like cap and trade, card check, stimulus bill, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Obamacare. So these were not measures that Reagan took a stand on, but I have no doubt that he would be right on each one. If we were proposing this resolution in 1981 for the 1982 election cycle, we would list, strategic missile defense, Reagan’s tax cuts, etc. He was right on those issues.""
 
But our mission here is not to critique the usefulness of Bopp's 10-point checklist; it's to judge whether Olbermann is right to say that Reagan would have fallen short on three or more items. On one item (amnesty for illegal immigrants) Reagan definitely broke with today's conservative orthodoxy. But on three others (abortion, gun control and fiscal policy) evidence exists in either direction. So, deciding whether Reagan qualifies under the rules of the resolution ends up being a tough call with evidence for both sides. We rate Olbermann's assertion Half True.","[(""Keith Olbermann,  comments  on MSNBC's  Countdown with Keith Olbermann  , Nov. 23, 2009\n\xa0\nJames Bopp Jr. (lead sponsor),  RNC Resolution on Financial Support of Candidates  , accessed Nov. 30, 2009"", 'http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34128492/ns/msnbc_tv-countdown_with_keith_olbermann/'), ('New York Times  \' Caucus blog, ""  Chief Sponsor Defends G.O.P.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'Lou Dobbs']","
Did Lou Dobbs oppose amnesty? He doesn't oppose it now.
","
Before resigning as a CNN anchor Nov. 11, Lou Dobbs made a name for himself opposing illegal immigration. So we were surprised to see him a few weeks later on the Spanish-language network Telemundo declaring himself a friend to Latinos.


""Whatever you have thought of me in the past, I can tell you right now that I am one of your greatest friends and I mean for us to work together,"" Dobbs said during a half-hour interview with Maria Celeste on the news program

Al Rojo Vivo

. Dobbs said he was considering his options and might make a run for public office.


For most of the interview, Celeste grilled Dobbs about news reports aired on his CNN show that she said were inflammatory and denigrated immigrants. Dobbs said he made mistakes and corrected them, which Celeste disputed. One of the top examples was a report Dobbs ran in 2007 that said undocumented immigrants were responsible for 7,000 new cases of leprosy spread over three years, a claim that has been

widely


debunked

. (There were actually 431 new cases between 2003 and 2005.)


Dobbs said on Telemundo that the United States needs a ""rational, effective humane policy"" for immigration that emphasized securing the border. But also said, ""We need the ability to legalize illegal immigrants on certain conditions.""


That last point surprised us, because we thought Dobbs opposed efforts to offer citizenship to undocumented immigrants, commonly called amnesty.


We went poring through the files, and interestingly, we found no point-blank case where Dobbs himself said he personally opposed amnesty.


But he certainly gave the impression that he didn't much care for it. He was particularly opposed to a 2007 immigration bill promoted by President George W. Bush and Republican Sen. John McCain that included eventual citizenship for some illegal immigrants. In one show, he called the bill ""idiotic,"" ""just bizarre"" and ""a horrible piece of legislation.""


He asked his viewers to vote on the following question: ""Do you believe the Senate, the White House and those who support amnesty for millions of illegal aliens are simply ignoring our existing U.S. law and the will of the American people? Yes or no? Cast your vote at loudobbs.com,"" he said on May 23, 2007. Later, he reported, ""The results of our poll tonight: 97 percent of you responding that the Senate, the White House and those who support amnesty for millions of illegal aliens are ignoring not only existing U.S. law, but the will of the American people.""


Dobbs gave another provocative answer to reporter Leslie Stahl of

60 Minutes

when she interviewed him in May 2007.


""He all but campaigns against the president's guest worker proposal and seemed to suggest that all illegals should be rounded up,"" Stahl said, then asked him directly, ""But I wonder if you think that we can possibly deport all of those people?""


""I've never called for their deportation,"" Dobbs said. ""But at the same time, when this president and open-borders, illegal-alien-amnesty advocates say, 'You can't deport them,' my answer is: 'You want to bet?' Because this is the United States. ...  I think this country can do anything it sets its mind to.""


We next turned to two advocates on different sides of the immigration issue to see what they thought of Dobbs' recent comments to Telemundo.


The Southern Poverty Law Center has criticized Dobbs for promoting anti-immigrant views and false news reports. The center's director of research, Heidi Beirich, said that Dobbs has claimed many times to be a friend to immigrants, even though he brings on anti-immigrant guests who make false statements.


""He's let his guests say things that he hasn't challenged many, many times,"" Beirich said, ""He'll sit there and make comments like, 'Incredible,' 'Amazing,' 'Mind-boggling.'""


Of his comments on Telemundo, Beirich said, ""It seemed to me very cynical and opportunistic, based on the idea that he wants to jump into politics.""


We also spoke with Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies and the author of

The New Case Against Immigration, Both Legal and Illegal

. Krikorian said he differs with Dobbs in that Dobbs generally favored

legal

immigration, opposing citizenship only for those who entered the country illegally.


""He was clearly opposed to legalizing illegal aliens, period. There is just no question about it,"" Krikorian said. ""Everyone who cared about immigration thought he was against amnesty.""


We asked Krikorian if there was any sort of middle ground here in which someone could favor citizenship for some undocumented immigrants but still be opposed to amnesty.


Krikorian said he didn't think so. ""That's what amnesty means -- letting illegal immigrants stay,"" he said. ""He was against legalizing illegal immigrants, and now he says he's for it.""


We reached a spokesman for Dobbs, Robert Dilenschneider, who said that Dobbs does indeed believe that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the country under certain conditions.


""I think you're going to see a new Lou Dobbs in the next year or two, a man looking for solutions, not for problems,"" he added.


In ruling on whether Dobbs changed his position on citizenship for undocumented immigrants, it's clear that he now favors legalization under certain circumstances. We have not been able to find statements in the past where Dobbs said specifically that he opposed amnesty. But he gave the distinct impression that he opposed it, and many people clearly thought he did oppose it. Now, at a minimum, Dobbs is significantly changing his tone on the issue. We hesitate to give him a Full Flop because we found his older position to be slippery and unclear. So we rate his position a Half Flip.

Krugman says Bush was first president to lead country into war and cut taxes
","With President Barack Obama scheduled to make a speech on Dec. 1 on how the United States will proceed with the war in Afghanistan, war spending was the topic du jour on the Sunday political talk shows. Some Democratic officials have even talked of a war surtax to pay for the expense of additional troops. Depending on how many more troops Obama decides to send, the cost could top $30 billion. ""This is a lot of money,"" liberal  New York Times  columnist Paul Krugman said on ABC's  This Week with George Stephanopoulos  on Nov. 29, 2009. ""And the point is, we should have been paying for these wars to begin with, right from the beginning. I mean, this was, if you want to talk firsts for Bush, this was the first time in American history that a president took us into a war and cut taxes."" As the talk about the price tag for the war in Afghanistan heats up, we thought it would be worthwhile to take a look at Krugman's claim about Bush being the first to cut taxes after leading the country into war, and to add some context. Generally, we found, taxes and wars have followed a fairly predictable pattern: Taxes rise during wartime and then come back down in the years afterward. We'll start with the Civil War. Congress enacted various income and excise taxes to meet the rising cost of the war, most of which were repealed in the years after the war. During World War I, the 1916 Revenue Act and the War Revenue Act of 1917 increased tax revenue from $761 million in 1916 to $3.6 billion in 1918. After the war, in the 1920s, Congress cut taxes five times. The same was true during World War II. Tax increases over several years raised revenues from $8.7 billion in 1941 to $45.2 billion in 1945. Again, tax cuts followed the war. It's worth noting, however, that during all of those wars, the war expenses were much larger than today, relative to the size of the economy. Congress hasn't formally declared war since then, but we think it's fair to consider the wars in Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf and Iraq. However, we have decided not to include the armed conflicts in Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1989 due to their much smaller cost, length and scope. So those are the wars. But what about major tax cuts? That's a smaller and somewhat more subjective list. Some of the most notable tax cuts have come during peacetime, such as the Reagan tax cut that took effect over the years 1982-84, and the smaller capital gains tax cuts under Carter and Clinton. The one notable exception is the Kennedy tax cuts, which took effect in 1964. The conflict in Vietnam stretched from 1959 to 1975, but when the Kennedy tax cuts were implemented, the Vietnam War did not have much of an impact on the U.S. budget. Within 18 months, when the tax cuts were in full bloom, the United States was spending plenty in Vietnam. The tax rates were phasing down just as our commitment in Vietnam was ramping up, said William Ahern of the Tax Foundation. ""That would maybe be a counter example (to Krugman),"" he said. But many argue the Kennedy tax cuts shouldn't count in Krugman's example because they came at a time when the United States did not anticipate the escalation of the war that followed. ""The Kennedy tax cuts were proposed, and then adopted by Congress, before the Vietnam war was a big expenditure item,"" said Gary Burtless, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. ""Vietnam initially did not require much in the way of additional outlays; it was not like either World War II or the Korean War, which started out with a huge runup in military spending. It was not until 1968 that the Johnson administration proposed the surtax to help pay for the Vietnam War. ... Still, the Vietnam era surtax went into effect within five years of major spending on that war. We are now more than eight years into the 'war on terrorism,' and we’ve had only tax reductions; no tax hikes."" We think Krugman is on firm ground. Aside from the Kennedy tax cuts during the Vietnam War, which were adopted before Vietnam became such a major fiscal issue, taxes have gone up during war. ""Traditionally countries raise taxes to pay for wars, then cut taxes by a portion of the amount raised once peace descends,"" agreed J.D. Foster, senior fellow in the economics of fiscal policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. But Foster noted two caveats. One, the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 came during a jobless recovery period after a recession. And the economic stimulus package championed by Obama includes $282 billion in tax cuts over two years -- also in the midst of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""Curious though,"" Foster said, ""whether Krugman is arguing we should have raised taxes when the economy was experiencing a jobless recovery (and by implication arguing we should raise taxes now), or whether he is trying to say Obama is just like Bush since if Bush was the first to do this, then Obama was the second."" Krugman has not advocated a tax increase to deal with the war in Afghanistan. And we think Krugman also has some wiggle room on that second point, because he said Bush was the first president who ""took us into a war"" and cut taxes. Both wars were inherited by Obama. Again, there are many different political and economic realities now than there were when taxes generally rose during wars, but Krugman is still mostly right. We dock him some points, though, because the Kennedy tax cuts technically came during the Vietnam War and rate the statement Mostly True.","[('Tax Foundation,  ""U.S. Federal Individual Income Tax Rates History, 1913-2009"" ', 'http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/151.html'), ('U.S. Treasury Web site,  Fact Sheets: Taxes, History of the U.S. Tax System ', 'No link'), ('U.S. News and World Report Web site,  ""Is Obama Stimulus Plan Also the Biggest Tax Cut Ever?""  by Robert Schlesinger, Feb. 12, 2009', 'http://www.treas.gov/education/fact-sheets/taxes/ustax.shtml'), ('CQ Transcripts, ABC\'s ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos,"" Nov. 30, 2009', 'No link'), ('Interview with William Ahern of the Tax Foundation, Nov. 30, 2009', 'https://www.usnews.com/blogs/robert-schlesinger/2009/02/12/is-obama-stimulus-plan-also-the-biggest-tax-cut-ever.html'), ('E-mail interview with Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, Nov. 30, 2009', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2009/nov/30/paul-krugman/krugman-says-bush-was-first-president-lead-country/

$6,800 for cap and trade not a CBO estimate
","Critics of the Democratic cap-and-trade proposal have many complaints about the plan, but their biggest is cost. They say it will cost so much that it will be a significant burden on a typical American family.

The latest variation of this comes in a chain e-mail that contends the cap-and-trade plan will require more energy-efficient homes (a claim we rated  Pants on Fire  ). The e-mail says, ""The Congressional Budget Office -- supposedly non-partisan -- estimates that in just a few years the average cost to every family of four will be $6,800 per year. No one is excluded.""

We've spent a lot of time  looking into claims  about how much the cap-and-trade plan could cost families, and one thing's for certain: There's no consensus. The Environmental Protection Agency says it could cost as little as $80 per year while the conservative Heritage Foundation says it could cost as much as $1,241 annually in higher energy bills.

We've explained the pros and cons of the various estimates in those previous items, so here we're going to look into the chain e-mail's claim that the CBO estimates cap-and-trade will cost a family of four $6,800 a year.

The bill in question is called the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. It is sponsored by Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, and aims to reduce carbon emissions 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Companies, particularly utilities, would have to either buy pollution credits or adopt cleaner technology.

Critics say that either way, the cost of energy will go up, and that cost will be passed on to the consumer.

The CBO is a key player because it is a widely respected nonpartisan branch of Congress that calculates cost estimates. In June 2009, the CBO released an analysis of the House bill, saying that the economywide cost of the cap-and-trade program in 2020 would be $22 billion -- or about $175 per household. The individual cost would vary depending on your wealth. Low-income consumers could expect to save $40 a year because of credits from utilities, while high-income consumers would see a net cost for energy of $235 to $340 annually. It's also important to note that the costs are expected to vary year to year because of the way the law would be phased in. The CBO chose 2020 as a milestone for its analysis because it's a point at which the program would have been in effect for eight years, giving the economy and polluters time to adjust. But had the CBO chosen a later date, the cost per family may have been higher because the government would gradually be charging polluters more.

We traced the $6,800 estimate back to a report from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that has been very critical of the cap-and-trade plan. In the report, the group criticizes the CBO for failing to consider the harm that the cap-and-trade plan could do to the economy. The conservative group says the law could cause companies to produce less, which would reduce the GDP in 2020 by $161 billion in 2009 dollars. By 2035, it would be $650 billion lower, which works out to about $6,800 per family of four per year.

So the chain e-mail has taken the estimate from a conservative think tank and falsely attributed it to the CBO, a nonpartisan branch of Congress. There are many legitimate questions that can be raised about the cost of cap-and-trade, but it's simply incorrect to say the CBO came up with the $6,800 figure. We find this claim False.","[('Congressional Budget Office,  Cap and Trade Costs  , June 19, 2009', 'https://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/103xx/doc10327/06-19-CapAndTradeCosts.pdf '), ('Congressional Budget Office,  Greenhouse gas report  , Sept. 17, 2009', 'No link'), ('Heritage Foundation,  CBO Grossly Underestimates Cost of Cap and Trade  , June 24, 2009', 'https://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/105xx/doc10573/09-17-Greenhouse-Gas.pdf'), ('Wall Street Journal editorial,  The Cap and Tax Fiction  , June 26, 2009', 'No link'), ('Heritage Foundation,  Change in GDP Due to Waxman-Markey  , accessed Nov. 26, 2009\n\n\n\xa0', 'http://www.heritage.org/Research/EnergyandEnvironment/wm2503.cfm')]",/factchecks/2009/nov/27/chain-email/6800-cap-and-trade-not-cbo-estimate/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Pundits', 'Taxes', 'Ed Schultz']","
Schultz says health care bill will only tax top 2 percent
","Republicans have frequently criticized the Democrats' health care bills by saying that they will make Americans pay more. On Nov. 20, 2009, MSNBC host Ed Schultz fired back, arguing that ""98 percent of the American people will not see their taxes go up because of this bill.""

On the show, Schultz didn't specify whether he was referring to the House or Senate health care reform bill. However, a spokeswoman contacted by PolitiFact said he was referring to the House bill, so we will judge him on that basis here.

We looked at analyses of the House bill and found one big tax -- the so-called ""millionaire's tax"" -- and a few more modest ones that would hit individuals. Let's address the millionaire's tax first.

Starting in 2011, the House bill would impose a 5.4 percent tax on individuals making more than $500,000 a year and on couples earning at least $1 million. This measure is expected to collect $460 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But the number of taxpayers hit by this tax would be fewer than 1 million people, or less than 1 percent of tax filers, according to Internal Revenue Service statistics. (Technical note: When calculating the percentages of Americans, the IRS uses a baseline of almost 143 million tax returns filed in 2007, rather than individual people. So we will do the same.)

It should be noted that the number of people paying the ""millionaire's tax"" is likely to rise, since the tax thresholds are not going to be adjusted for inflation. This means that, barring widespread economic calamity, more people will be hit by the tax every year.

Still, the exact amount of the increase is hard to determine, so if we stick to the published numbers, Schultz is correct. In fact, he's given himself a margin of error, saying it would be 2 percent when in fact it would be 1 percent of Americans.

But there are a few other taxes in the bill that could hit individuals either directly or indirectly, and while the dollar amounts they collect are much smaller than what the ""millionaire's tax"" collects, the pool of people they would affect is much wider.

The most notable of these taxes is a penalty assessed on people who decline to buy their own health insurance. According to the bill, people would have to pay a 2.5 percent tax on their income or the dollar amount of a basic coverage plan, whichever is lower. Some people, especially those who are young and in good health, will choose to forgo insurance and pay the tax instead, because doing so will save them money.

In its analysis of the House bill, the CBO estimated that this provision would add $5 billion to $6 billion to the federal coffers annually between 2014 and 2019 -- about one-tenth the amount that the ""millionaire's tax"" kicks in during those years. But even though the dollar amounts involved are smaller, the number of individuals expected to pay the penalty is potentially much larger.

The CBO provided the total amount of penalty revenues rather than an estimate of the number of people paying the penalty, but it's possible to reverse-engineer the number of penalty payers. Depending on the method used, the number of people paying the penalty -- assuming CBO's assumptions are right -- could range from 2.5 million to 10 million, according to our estimates and consultations with tax experts.

One estimate pegs the number even higher. Working backward from the 23 million people that the CBO expects to be uninsured in 2019, the chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently estimated that most of the 18 million who are uninsured and who aren't illegal immigrants would be paying the penalty.

Two other taxes in the bill bear mentioning.

One is a 2.5 percent tax on most durable medical devices, which the Joint Committee on Taxation, a bipartisan arm of Congress, expects to generate $2 billion to $3 billion most years -- approximately one-twentieth of the amount collected by the ""millionaire's tax."" But while this is technically a tax on companies, it would almost certainly be passed along to consumers, and the number of people affected would be substantial. Because many people use medical devices in any given year, this tax would likely hit more than 2 percent of the population, even accounting for overlap with the other taxes included in the bill.

The other tax worth noting is on employers who do not offer health insurance. This, like the medical device tax, is a direct tax on businesses, but much of the cost would probably be borne by employees (in lower wages) or consumers (in higher prices). The CBO expects this tax to generate between $15 billion and $25 billion a year.

Experts disagree on whether it's fair to include these two taxes in the larger equation, because they hit taxpayers only indirectly, and because it's hard to quantify how many people will pay them. In the meantime, some would argue that the individual penalty isn't really a tax, because it's voluntary.

For the purposes of our analysis, we think it's fair to include the individual penalty, because, like the ""millionaire's tax,"" it will be administered through Americans' tax returns. But because we don't have good data on the device tax or the employer tax, we'll keep those out of our final equation.

So, Schultz is right that less than 2 percent -- indeed, less than 1 percent -- of Americans would be subject to the millionaire's tax, at least at the beginning. But while making estimates is tricky, it's likely that many more people will choose to pay the individual penalty, most likely pushing the numbers above the 2 percent level Schultz cited. And if we had chosen to include the device tax, the percentages would climb higher still. So we rate his statement Barely True.

"['Taxes', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio says he never voted to increase taxes
","Marco Rubio is all of the sudden a darling of the American conservative movement in his U.S. Senate primary run against Florida Gov. Charlie Crist. Consider his bona fides: Rubio opposes publicly run health care and is against abortion. He has been highly critical of the president's $787 billion stimulus plan. He is open to expanding oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. He has been endorsed by Mike Huckabee and coverboy for the right-leaning  National Review  .   To top it off, there's this:   ""I have never voted for a tax increase,"" Rubio says on his campaign  Web site  . ""While I generally support tax cuts, I believe meaningful tax reform that simplifies our tax code, makes it easier to understand and is more fair to the taxpayer should be our ultimate goal.""   In almost nine years in the Florida House, the last two as speaker, Rubio was an outspoken critic of tax hikes. Rubio twice opposed a tax increase on cigarettes only to have the $1-per-pack hike signed into law by Crist after Rubio left office.   And Rubio, along with Crist, led an effort in 2007 to lower property taxes. Rubio went as far as to propose eliminating property taxes on primary homes altogether, replacing them with a state sales tax increase. That measure ultimately failed, but the idea still won him style points. Grover Norquist, a national conservative figure and president of the anti-tax advocacy group Americans for Tax Reform, called Rubio the most pro-taxpayer legislative leader in the country.   ""Runaway property taxes threaten the standard of living of millions of homeowners and renters and the bottom lines of businesses big and small,"" Rubio  said  during the property tax debate of 2007.   The rhetoric clearly is anti-tax.   But does the voting record -- he said ""never"" -- always match?    Rubio's tax record  PolitiFact scoured Rubio's nine-year voting history as a member of the Florida House. We also looked through votes Rubio cast in his two years as a member of the West Miami City Commission. As a city commissioner, Rubio voted twice to raise property taxes. And in the Florida House, while he pushed to cut property taxes collected by local governments, he also repeatedly voted to force school districts statewide to collect more property taxes, his record shows. Here's how: As part of the state budget each year, lawmakers set an amount the state's 67 school districts are required to contribute to education funding. The amount is set as a dollar figure. The state Department of Education then takes that dollar figure and turns it into a corresponding property tax rate for each school district. The process is called the ""required local effort."" From 2000 to 2008 -- the years Rubio was in office -- the required local effort from Florida's school districts rose about 102 percent, from $4.08 billion to $8.25 billion. Rubio voted for the budget, and the schools tax, each year. Some of that increase was created by new construction, but at least $2.5 billion came in additional property tax payments made by Floridians. Two important caveats:    •    In 2008, the Rubio-led House originally passed a budget that did not raise the schools tax -- the increase came later during budget negotiations between the House and Senate. Rubio praised that year's final budget as being balanced ""without raising taxes.""    •  And in eight of Rubio's nine years, the corresponding tax rate went down. But because of increasing property values, the actual dollar amount -- the figure the Legislature sets -- grew. The best example of this comes in 2007. As Rubio, Crist and the Legislature were pushing to reform the state's property tax system, they also were passing a budget that increased school property tax collections about $340 million, excluding increases for new construction. In an interview with PolitiFact this week, Rubio offered two rebuttals: First, that he was only one member of the Legislature. And second, that he wasn't prepared to vote against the entire state budget only to make a point about the schools tax. Earlier this year, Rubio offered another explanation of his schools tax vote, saying that it wasn't a tax increase because the tax rate didn't go up. ""Anybody who voted against those budgets, would have voted against massive tax cuts,"" Rubio said. ""Somebody could have made that claim. That a 'no' vote on the budget was a vote against tax cuts."" But in 2007, Rubio was given a proposal that would have allowed him to support the budget and prevent a school property tax increase. After   Crist vetoed about $459.2 million from the 2007-2008 budget, then-House Democratic leader Dan Gelber wrote Rubio asking the Legislature to use that money to reduce the school property tax increase.   Rubio balked, saying it would require a change to state spending practices. ""I share your distaste for the property tax,"" Rubio wrote in a formal response. ""In fact, I wish it would go away totally, at least on homesteaded properties. But as you know public education funding in Florida is a partnership between the state and local school boards. The property tax is the only method of generating revenue we have given school districts."" Though he voted for the increases, Rubio did attempt to replace the required local effort with an increased sales tax in 2007 as speaker. The plan went nowhere in the Legislature, and a constitutional amendment for the tax swap plan was thrown off the ballot the following year by a Florida circuit court judge.    State legislators aren't forced to hold public hearings and publicly acknowledge a tax increase like local governments. Some tax bills refer to the tax only as ""School-state"" or ""School-state law.""  Other  tax bills don't break the state tax out at all.   It's a system, says state Rep. Adam Fetterman, D-Port St. Lucie, that helps perpetuate a belief that Tallahassee lawmakers aren't raising taxes, when they actually are.   Fetterman authored a  bill  this year requiring tax collectors to tell residents if state legislators were raising school property taxes.   The bill was never heard.   ""We had some folks in Tallahassee beating their chest, and nearly breaking their arms, shouting about the largest tax cut in Florida history,"" Fetterman said. ""Then they turned around and forced local governments, specifically school boards, to increase taxes. I am tired and fed up -– as are most of my constituents -– of the saying of one thing and the doing of another thing in Tallahassee.""  Old city votes  Rubio also voted in 1998 and 1999 for increases in property tax collections as a member of the West Miami City Commission, West Miami records show. PolitiFact tracked down the final budget resolutions for both years. Without getting too technical, they say the city of West Miami, without raising tax rates, was increasing property taxes -- 1.402 percent in 1998 and 5.545 percent in 1999. The roll call has then-Commissioner Rubio as voting ""Y"" both years. It's worth noting that Rubio later argued as a member of the Legislature that local governments were raising taxes while being able to claim they were keeping the tax rate the same. Rubio said this week it's a sign of a flawed system. Something he attempted to correct. ""The essence of our campaign is that property taxes are an inherently unfair way to generate revenue,"" Rubio said. ""There were very likely years that people were taxed more even though they were earning less."" Back to Rubio's original statement. Though he claims to have never voted for a tax increase, we found that he has several times. First, as a commissioner in West Miami when he approved an increase in property tax collections, then as a state legislator when he voted year after year for budgets that forced school districts statewide to collect more property taxes. School districts were simply the middleman, in charge of collecting the money, but they did it at the behest of legislators.   Maybe the votes could be considered appropriate. Or reasoned. Or even necessary. But they were votes to raise taxes -- and he did say ""never."" We rate his claim False.","[('""  Senate candidate Marco Rubio shows conservative stripes in Panhandle swing  ,"" St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald, Nov. 3, 2009', 'http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/article1048753.ece'), ('Marco Rubio 2010 campaign web site,  Issues ', 'No link'), ('""Tax eyed for cheap cigarettes,"" Miami Herald, March 17, 2004, accessed via Nexis', 'http://www.marcorubio.com/issues/'), ('""Cigarette tax hike,"" Miami Herald, April 15, 2008, accessed via Nexis', 'No link'), ('""  Rubio tries to sell tax change  ,"" St. Petersburg Times, Feb. 27, 2007', 'http://www.sptimes.com/2007/02/27/State/Rubio_tries_to_sell_t.shtml'), ('""  On special session, he\'ll star  ,"" St. Petersburg Times, June 10, 2007', 'No link'), ('Interview with Cheryl Etters, Florida Department of Education, Nov. 19, 2009', 'http://www.sptimes.com/2007/06/10/State/On_special_session_st.shtml'), ('Required local effort figures from 2000-2008, provided by Florida Department of Education', 'No link'), ('""Republicans admit tax hikes,"" Palm Beach Post, March 31, 2007, accessed via Nexis', 'http://www.floridatrend.com/article.asp?aID=49261'), ('Interview with Marco Rubio, Nov. 24, 2009', 'No link'), ('""  Rubio\'s 100 ideas  ,"" Florida Trend, July 1, 2008', 'http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/files/letter_to_reps_gelber_cusack.PDF'), ('Rubio  letter  to state Rep.

Chain e-mail says those on public option will have to get microchip implant
","
It's a recipe for a great conspiracy theory: a big health care bill, an effort to centralize medical records and a new microchip that can be implanted under your skin.


Just add outrage and stir!


A chain e-mail warns darkly that an ""implantable radio frequency transponder system for patient identification and health information"" would be ""implanted in the majority of people who opt to become covered by the public health care option"" -- the government-run insurance plan designed as an affordable option for people who are uninsured or whose employers don't offer health coverage. The chip would ""collect data in medical patients,"" including ""claims data"" and ""electronic health records.""


Americans, the e-mail continues, would likely flock to the the public option. This would mean that ""the number of people chipped will be plentiful as well. Children conceived by parents who are already covered under the public option will more than likely be implanted with a chip by the consent of the parent. Eventually everyone will be implanted with a chip. And with the price and coverage of the public option being so competitive with the private companies, the private company [sic] may not survive.""


This seems on its face to be so ridiculous that we wondered if it was satire. But we couldn't find its origins. Meanwhile, the e-mail is making the rounds (it was sent to us by a reader who wondered whether it's true) and we found it posted on dozens of blogs, so we decided to examine it.


First, let's get out of the way the one grain of truth in the claim -- a rice-sized grain, to be precise.


A company called PositiveID, which has its headquarters in Delray Beach, Fla., sells a small microchip that can be implanted under the skin for identification purposes. It can be read from a few inches away by a handheld scanner. The company began working on its product in December 2001, and by October 2004, it had received the Food and Drug Administration's approval to insert the device into patients. According to the company, a few hospitals have ""agreed to use the technology in their emergency departments.""


Unlike the way the chip was described in the chain e-mail, the device provides only an identification number and does not, by itself, store health data. Instead, a medical provider would be able to access the person's medical records by scanning the device's unique number and using it to connect to the company's ""secure, private online database,"" which includes the person's health records. The device ""is always with you and cannot be lost or stolen,"" the company's Web site says. ""It provides emergency room doctors and nurses with your vital medical and emergency contact information, allowing them to treat you rapidly, accurately and safely during an emergency.""


The company adds that the microchip does not contain ""any Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking capabilities. And unlike conventional forms of identification, [it] cannot be lost, stolen, misplaced, or counterfeited. It is safe, secure, reversible, and always with you.""


Now, this chip is probably not everyone's cup of tea. But lawmakers understand that reality and have not -- repeat, not -- required participants in the public option to sign up for insertion. Not even close. Indeed, as with a number of claims in chain e-mails we've reviewed relating to this year's congressional health care bills, the chain e-mail stitches together disparate words and phrases from the Senate and House health care bills to distort the truth.


The bill produced by three House committees, H.R. 3200, included a provision to create a National Medical Device Registry, which would centralize data on medical devices (from pacemakers to artificial limbs) so that experts and the public could analyze how safe and effective different kinds of medical devices are. The bill decreed that items the FDA classifies as Class III — the 10 percent of devices that, according to the FDA, ""sustain or support life, are implanted, or present potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury"" -- would be included in the registry, as would any Class II device (a category of less-complex items accounting for 43 percent of all devices) ""that is implantable, life-supporting, or life-sustaining.""


And that's where the red-flag word ""implantable"" popped up in the bill. Lots of medical devices are ""implantable"" -- think of heart stents, artificial knees and dental fillings. But microchips make for a good conspiracy theory, so the e-mail focuses on them.


Even if microchips had somehow been the target of that line in the bill -- and they're not -- the provision in question, which doesn't appear in the Senate bill, only talks about creating a database that keeps tabs on devices that have already been implanted in people. It says nothing whatsoever about requiring implantation ""in the majority of people who opt to become covered by the public health care option."" That part is fiction, pure and simple.


Here's an odd postscript. As the final House version (H.R. 3962) approached a vote by the full chamber, the term ""implantable"" was removed from that section. It's not clear why the change was made, but the chain e-mail now has even less credibility than it did before (if that's possible).


So add this one to the list of silly, discredited claims about the health bill. It's so ridiculously wrong, we rule it Pants on Fire.

Recovery.gov assigns statewide education jobs to one congressional district
","The Obama administration has promoted its Web site Recovery.gov as a bold new step in government transparency and a convenient way for voters to see that the economic stimulus program is working. Some Republicans say the site is a bunch of unreliable propaganda.   Florida Republican Rep. Jeff Miller ridiculed the site in a newsletter Nov. 19, writing about how he looked on the Web site and found jobs created in Florida's 34th, 53rd, 86th, and ""00th"" districts.   ""The problem is, these congressional districts do not exist,"" Miller wrote. ""Florida only has TWENTY-FIVE congressional districts.""   ""We know that the Administration is pulling a 'jobs created or saved' number out of thin air despite the fact that the unemployment rate remains high,"" Miller wrote. ""The people of Florida know. We know that although Democrats represent only 10 of Florida’s 25 districts, their districts received 60% of the stimulus funds. These numbers reek of partisanship and potential corruption.""   Miller was right that Recovery.gov did have incorrect information on it. Officials blamed it on errors entering the data and have since replaced the erroneous districts with the notation ""unassigned congressional district."" ABC News broke the story on Nov. 16 and the corrections were made about two days later. The error caught our attention here at PolitiFact, and  we archived the Florida page  that confirms Miller's observations on bad district data. We rated  Miller's statement on this  Mostly True.   So Miller was correct about the errors on Recovery.gov congressional districts, though they're fixed now. But was he right that Democratic districts are receiving more money than Republican districts?   It's worth noting that Miller is criticizing the data but is still using it to make a political point. We ran the data ourselves using the Recovery.gov numbers, and found he was correct. In Florida, Democratic districts are getting 57 percent of money reported thus far, about $3.9 billion, while Republican districts are getting 43 percent, or $2.9 billion.   It's important to understand that at this point, Recovery.gov is pretty much the only game in town for quantifying the stimulus. The numbers are reported by government agencies and private businesses from around the country, and they automatically feed into Recovery.gov. The government does not independently verify the numbers, but officials have taken steps to remove numbers that seem obviously incorrect once they are pointed out.   Nevertheless, officials are aware that the data at times contain errors. The U.S. Government Accountability Office, an independent agency that does investigations for Congress, found that while agencies and employers were making good-faith efforts to report data, the reporting has been inconsistent. ""Even recipients of similar types of funds appear to have interpreted the reporting guidance in somewhat different ways and took different approaches in how they developed their jobs data,"" the agency said in a report filed last week.   Looking at stimulus money in Florida, we noticed that the money and jobs reported for District 2 -- a seat in North Florida held by Democrat Allen Boyd -- stuck out like a sore thumb. That district reported almost 24,000 jobs saved or created and $2.2  billion  in funding. The next closest is District 11, a seat in Tampa held by Democrat Kathy Castor. Her district listed 430 jobs saved or created and $428 million in funding.   We suspected that statewide funding is being applied to Boyd's district because it includes the state capital in Tallahassee. In fact, we found a project for the  Florida Department of Education  that listed close to 13,200 jobs saved or created and $1.5 billion in funding -- all credited to District 2. The project details said it was intended to pay for teachers, teachers' aides and other educational staff. The fund was tagged as being for the ""State Fiscal Stabilization Fund,"" which aimed to make up statewide budget shortfalls. This suggested that much of the money credited to Boyd's Tallahassee district was actually spent statewide.   We contacted the office of Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican, and a spokesman confirmed our observation about the 13,200 jobs.   ""These jobs represent statewide information and statewide jobs,"" said spokesman Sterling Ivey in an e-mail.  ""Showing them in the Tallahassee Congressional District or in Leon County does not reflect that the jobs are statewide.  Our hope is that the federal reporting system will be refined to more accurately reflect the information.""   We also asked him whether there was any evidence that the money was being distributed in a partisan manner.   ""Most of the funds are distributed through existing federal funding formulas or through competitive processes.  Don Winsted, Special Advisor to Governor Crist, has closely observed this process throughout and has seen no evidence of partisan distribution of funds.       ""It is probably fair to criticize the federal reporting process (and last week’s GAO report on job reporting does exactly that), but the shortcomings are largely attributable to a first attempt to report very complex information rather than any partisan dimension,"" Ivey said.   Remove the Department of Education funding from the Democratic side of the ledger, and the total for Democratic districts actually drops a bit below the total for Republican districts: $2.4 billion vs. $2.9 billion.   We asked Miller's staff about this, and they sent us the following statement from the congressman: ""Recovery.gov made numerous errors in reporting of jobs and Stimulus money disbursements on their website.  Although some of their errors have been removed from the site, it would not surprise me if there were other errors in the assigning of disbursements to the wrong Congressional District.""   Clearly, the data on Recovery.gov is subject to some amount of clerical errors and distortions. Those errors might be unintentional, but the data should still be approached with caution. And we should note this isn't the first time that we've seen problems with the Obama administration's aggressive promotion of stimulus numbers. Back in May, President Barack Obama said the economic stimulus has ""  saved or created nearly 150,000 jobs  "" in its first 100 days. That was an estimate created by White House economic advisers, and independent economists we interviewed said that it was far too early to create a definite projection with a high level of accuracy. So we rated his statement Barely True. On the other hand, our reporting has also found the stimulus is properly credited for contributing to 3.5 percent growth in the Gross Domestic Product during the third quarter. Talk show host Rush Limbaugh said all that was due to  Cash for Clunkers and a homebuyers tax credit  , but we found that Half True.   In the claim we're examining here, Rep. Jeff Miller said, ""Although Democrats represent only 10 of Florida's 25 districts, their districts received 60 percent of the stimulus funds."" Recovery.gov is the primary source for data on the stimulus, and it does show more money going to Democrats. But it didn't take us long to notice that the projects reported in at least one Democratic district are way off. Miller himself said the data was unreliable, but then uses the same data to say Democrats are getting more money. That doesn't seem to be the case.

Nonexistent congressional districts were on Recovery.gov. They're gone now.
","The Obama administration has promoted its Web site Recovery.gov as a bold new step in government transparency and a convenient way for voters to see that the economic stimulus program is working. Some Republicans say the site is filled with unreliable propaganda.   Florida Republican Rep. Jeff Miller ridiculed the site in a newsletter Nov. 19, writing about how he looked on Recovery.gov and found jobs created in Florida's 34th, 53rd, 86th, and ""00th"" districts.   ""The problem is, these congressional districts do not exist,"" Miller wrote. ""Florida only has TWENTY-FIVE congressional districts.   ""We know that the Administration is pulling a 'jobs created or saved' number out of thin air despite the fact that the unemployment rate remains high,"" Miller wrote. ""The people of Florida know. We know that although Democrats represent only 10 of Florida’s 25 districts, their districts received 60% of the stimulus funds. These numbers reek of partisanship and potential corruption.""   Miller was right that Recovery.gov did have incorrect information on it. Officials blamed it on errors entering the data and have since replaced the erroneous districts with the notation ""unassigned congressional district."" ABC News broke the story on Nov. 16 and the corrections were made about two days later. The error caught our attention here at PolitiFact, and  we archived the Florida page  that confirms Miller's observations on bad district data.   We also looked into whether  Democratic districts received more money than Republican districts  , and rated that statement Barely True.   Here, we're verifying Miller's statement that Recovery.gov listed congressional districts that do not exist. That was indeed the case until news reports brought attention to the wrong data. Officials removed the data the evening before Miller posted his newsletter, so that now the jobs and money are attributed to ""unassigned congressional district."" So we rate Miller's statement Mostly True.","[(""ABC News,  Exclusive: Jobs 'Saved or Created' in Congressional Districts That Don't Exist  , Nov. 16, 2009"", 'https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jobs-saved-created-congressional-districts-exist/story?id=9097853'), ('Recovery.gov,  Florida summary  , accessed Nov. 23, 2009', 'No link'), ('Jeff Miller,  Miller Newsletter on Stimulus  , November 19, 2009', 'http://www.recovery.gov/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=stateSummaryAllCD&statecode=FL'), ('Recovery.gov,  Florida Education Department ', 'No link'), ('U.S. Government Accountability Office, via the Washington Post,  Recipient Reported Jobs Data Provide Some Insight into Use of Recovery Act Funding, but Data Quality and Reporting Issues Need Attention  , November 2009', 'http://jeffmiller.house.gov/news/email/show.aspx?ID=2UHAOPO3UHYRKXPSYTBP3KVALM'), ('ProPublica,  Are the Criticisms of the Gov’s Stimulus Site Legit?  , Nov. 19, 2009', 'No link'), ('ProPublica,  ProPublica’s Unofficial Guide to Recovery.gov  , Oct. 30, 2009', 'http://www.recovery.gov/transparency/pages/recipientprojectsummary508.aspx?awardidsur=27327&awardtype=Grants'), ('Washington Post,  Auditors raise doubts about stimulus numbers, but expect data will improve  , Nov. 19, 2009', 'No link'), ('Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board,  Recovery Board Corrects Congressional District Errors Identified by OMB  , Nov. 18, 2009', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/documents/recipients_report.pdf'), ('The White House Web site,  Reality Check: The Very Real Jobs the Recovery Act is Supporting  , Nov. 19, 2009', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2009/nov/24/jeff-miller/nonexistent-congressional-districts-recovery-gov/

Chain e-mail claims cap-and-trade will require home retrofits, license before sale
","
Here's one way to get our attention.

 

Send us a chain e-mail with this subject line: ""We don't make this up.""

 

The e-mail, which we have received in several forms over the past few months, has to do with a cap-and-trade bill making its way through Congress and how it would treat energy efficiency in existing homes.  

 

According to the e-mail, ""Beginning 1 year after enactment of the Cap and Trade Act, you won't be able to sell your home unless you retrofit it to comply with the energy and water efficiency standards of this Act. H.R. 2454, the 'Cap & Trade' bill passed by the House of Representatives.""

 

""A year from now you won't be able to sell your house,"" the e-mail goes on. ""Yes, you read that right. The caveat is (there always is a caveat) that if you have enough money to make required major upgrades to your home, then you can sell it. But, if not, then forget it.""

 

Home sellers will require a government license to put their home on the market, according to the letter.

 

The claim has gone viral on the Internet, and versions of it have been repeated by Republican lawmakers, including

House Republican Leader John Boehner

. Our friends over at FactCheck.org

looked into

Boehner's claim over the summer and found it to be false.

 

We've explored many aspects of the bill, including

how much it would cost

and whether it would

create or cut jobs

. So here we will examine what the bill says about making existing homes more energy efficient.

 

Here's how cap-and-trade would work. Under House legislation, the target of the chain e-mail's criticism, the government would be required to set an overall cap on carbon emissions in an effort to slow climate change. More specifically, the bill aims to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Companies would either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits -- also known as allowances -- to continue polluting. Initially, most allowances would be given out free. But eventually companies would have to buy those permits from the government.

 

There's lots of language in the bill regarding building efficiency.

 

Section 201, for instance, requires building energy codes for new homes to be 30 percent more efficient than current standards when the bill goes into law and 50 percent more efficient by 2016. States and local governments will be responsible for enforcing the new codes, but will receive government allowances to cover the cost of developing and adopting the improvements. And Section 202 of the bill would establish a program that would allow states to help homeowners finance energy-efficient home retrofits; the more energy a retrofit saves, the more money the homeowner would get from the government to subsidize the work.

 

Finally, Section 204 would require the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a model program that states could voluntarily adopt to label new buildings for their energy performance. This ""license,"" as the chain e-mail calls it, is only applicable to new construction and would be completely voluntary.

 

In fact, that's a point the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the panel that has jurisdiction over the cap-and-trade bill, makes over and over in its summary of the legislation: ""Nothing would require a homeowner to audit or retrofit their home to ensure that it meets building code requirements,"" the document says.

 

Lane Burt, a building efficiency expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, who has blogged about the issue, says the e-mail is false.

 

""The anti-efficiency crowd have alleged that the [cap-and-trade] bill is going to require Americans trying to sell their homes to undergo some sort of energy inspection or meet some sort of green requirements -- 'or else,' "" he wrote of the supposed requirement in the bill. ""Of course, when I have heard and read this claim there isn't a provision cited, and for good reason -- it doesn't exist!""

 

William Fay, executive director of the Building Energy Efficient Codes Network -- a coalition including The Alliance to Save Energy, Duke Energy Corp. and the National Association of State Energy Officials among other organizations -- called the e-mail an ""urban myth.""

 

""The bill certainly does not require a retrofit, or an energy label for an existing home,"" Fay said. ""It does not make them a condition of sale.""

 

This fact-check is clear-cut. There's nothing in the bill that would require homeowners to retrofit their homes to meet new efficiency standards or get a government ""license"" before putting their home on the market. Homeowners who do want to retrofit their homes can do so voluntarily and with the help of government funding. This chain e-mail gets a Pants on Fire!

Boehner claims that the Senate health care bill includes an abortion fee
","
Republicans have found another flaw in the health care bill: They say Democrats are trying to impose a monthly abortion fee on anyone enrolled in the public health care option.


""Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's (D-NV) massive, 2,074-page bill would levy a new 'abortion premium' fee on Americans in the government-run plan,"" wrote House Republican Leader John Boehner on the GOP's Web site.


The House version of the health care bill included an amendment promoted by Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., to prevent abortion from being offered through the public plan, as well as additional restrictions for insurers who sell on the exchange.


But the Senate version of health care reform represents a clean slate and includes a provision similar to one added by Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., to the original version of the House legislation that would prevent the government from spending federal dollars on abortion procedures.


Here's how the Senate bill would treat the issue:


Health insurance companies participating in the insurance exchange, a virtual marketplace where consumers could compare and shop for insurance plans, could decide whether to offer abortion coverage. In each state, there would have to be at least one plan that offers the insurance and one that does not. People who get federal subsidies to help pay for coverage through the exchange could buy plans that offer abortion insurance. But the bill includes accounting rules to ensure that no tax dollars are used to pay for the procedure. The government can only pay for abortions in instances of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother, but the Health and Human Services secretary could decide to include abortion coverage beyond that. In any case, the public plan would be subject to the same rules.


We've covered the many claims from the left and the right about how abortion would be treated under health care reform, and you can read all of them

here

.


But Boehner's claim that the Senate bill includes a monthly ""abortion fee"" was new to us. Intrigued, we went directly to Page 122 of Section 1303 of the bill, the language Boehner is concerned about.


That section deals with measures the government will take to ensure that no plan offered through the exchange will use federal dollars to cover abortion procedures.


If a plan through the exchange does offer abortion coverage, ""the issuer of the plan shall ... segregate an amount equal to the actuarial amounts determined under subparagraph for all enrollees,"" the language says. The Health and Human Services secretary ""shall estimate the basic per enrollee, per month cost, determined on an average actuarial basis, for including coverage under a qualified health plan."" Finally, the secretary ""shall estimate such costs as if such coverage were included for the entire population covered; and may not estimate such a cost at less than $1 per enrollee per month.""


All that legalese means this: Because insurance companies participating in the exchange may not use tax dollars to pay for abortion procedures, they must ensure that an adequate amount of private funding -- which will come from private premiums -- is set aside. Per premium, that funding can be no less than $1 dollar a month; otherwise, it's up to the insurance company. All this is to ensure that there's enough private premiums to pay for abortions should participants need them.


So, the bill does require that abortion coverage through the exchange be paid for with private premiums.


But does the bill language dictate an abortion fee as Boehner says?


Usha Ranji, a policy analyst for the Kaiser Family Foundation, says no.


""I don't understand what [Boehner's] reference is to,"" she said. The provision simply ""outlines some technical direction of how you would establish cost of an abortion benefit.""
 
Lara Cartwright-Smith of George Washington University's public health school concurred, adding that everyone participating in the exchange would have the option of choosing a plan that does not include abortion.
 
So, back to Boehner's claim. The bill does not require a fee, or a charge above and beyond the premium cost specifically to cover abortions. And technically speaking, we don't know whether the public option will offer abortion coverage or not. Instead, it gives the Health and Human Services secretary a minimum for estimating the cost of covering abortions. So we give Boehner a False.
